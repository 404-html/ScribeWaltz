Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Five, four, three, two, one for sure. Live.

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       No magical. How are you? You're a fucking responsible guest. I just want to give you props for that. You took your phone, you shut that bitch off and you put it aside. That was a big thing for me also, just as a comedian and comedy clubs. You started seeing the comedy store become popular and I started noticing a bunch of chicks in there just looking at their phones nonstop. I even put this thing on my phone. It's an app called moment that tracks how long I'm using it and what I'm using, so if I get over a certain amount, I'm like, I get fucking put this thing down. Does very smart. We're all monkeys can look down at this thing. It's fascinating. The dope of means of. Yeah. I have a 15 year old son and nonstop. Yeah. Whitney. Cummings was explaining all the, like the actual chemical responses that go on.

Speaker 2:          00:00:54       Like you literally do become addicted to that for sure. And there's a lot of good shit on their problem, but I mean, how many times do you find yourself like about to go to bed and just like hitting refresh, checking twitter feeds. Maybe some interesting news stories coming up. Maybe there's something I missed. Let me check instagram. It was a crazy picture that I didn't say. It's okay to miss it. It is okay. It's totally okay to miss it. I go, I admire what he did. He stepped away from the whole fucking smartphone. Completely. Just had a full conversation with him about it yesterday because I said you had three things happened that allowed you to completely check out and go on this trip years ago. You have no kids, you know kids. You have no wife, no family. Which dog? Dog planathon. You wouldn't. He moved to New York.

Speaker 2:          00:01:39       I sold him a soda. Trey gave him all of my furniture because he was moving to New York when I was leaving New York. So I'm like, dude, have all this shit. Oh that's right. You were there for the daily show, for the daily show. And then I took off. I was commuting back and forth because I left my family in La and I took the Gig, so on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I'd work in New York and then I'd fucking fly back to Jesus' horrible mistake. Trust me. We talked about that before you did it and I was like, man, I don't believe you're doing this. I was killed myself. My back is all fucked up. I was telling a calendar, like I said, like I was a cashew shaped and jumping forward. Oh my God. It's horrible. Like if I cracked my, my whole back when you were in an airline seat constantly and you're just constantly all stressed out and your sleep is all fucked up.

Speaker 2:          00:02:26       It's not good. So I got cast in another show. I got the fuck out of there and I gave already all my things. So. But already has, like you said, no fish, nothing. And then he is financial freedom because he's got a, you know, the show on comedy central, he's got a great podcast, he's got all kinds of shit going on. And then he also has this attitude that allows him to do something like that because I don't have those three things I needed to. Financial Freedom. I got. But I have these three dependents. I have two dogs and have, I don't have the attitude, like if I'm not working nonstop, I feel crazy. You should tell people what you're talking about because a lot of people that are tuning into this podcast probably don't realize that our Ari, our good friend, checked out of civilization for three solid months at least.

Speaker 2:          00:03:15       Right? I think maybe more. First of all, he's rocking a flip phone. He won't, he doesn't have any APPS, so he doesn't. Um, he, he has no smartphone, but then he just decides to go away and check out. He'd no one's communicated with them. You know, we're sort of in business together on is all things comedy thing. And he's on our board of directors and I need to tell him about shit. And didn't even bother, like he, we did a skype and he's like, I'm gone. And then people on his show, the comedy central show, um, they're trying to get ahold of them. Nobody can get fucking ahold of art and he loves it. And me, if I seriously, I had to buy books. Like, you know, I read a lot of Jack reacher. Yeah. Do you know that the best character of all time?

Speaker 2:          00:04:04       Yeah. Six foot four, 240 pounds. I know Tom people associated with the Tom Cruise movie, but like this guy is the most bad ass. He's a military cop. Yeah. How is the Tom Cruise? A little tiny dude. He just option the movies. That's what happened. My uncle skip Tarantino came over to me. I didn't even know anything about Jack reacher and my brother's wedding. And he walks up and he goes, can you believe they made Tom Cruise? Jack reacher and I go, what are you talking about? There's a problem. And he broke the whole thing down. He goes, let me tell you something about Jack reacher Jack, which is six foot four. Jack reacher total bad ass. He's he, he's an expert marksman. He's a 10 steps ahead. He's a big numbers guy. This guy, Lee child created the perfect character, but. So I read all those books, but I have to force myself to read those books so I can chill the fuck out because again, and this is something that I'm a people of other comics who pointed out I can't be alone with my own thoughts.

Speaker 2:          00:05:01       Why is that? I don't know because I've had some crazy shit happen lately. A dad passed away, a lot of comics have passed away, have friends with a ton of comedians that have. Freddy Soto was one of my good, good buddies. He's gone to. But Dude, I started comedy with passed away early on. So I, you and Freddy Soto past me, you know, got me sponsored at the comedy store and um, I was very close to him like me and Sebastian, whereas openers. And so I think that might have something to do with it. It's like I'm trying to get a lot of great stuff happening, but I feel like I distract myself with work, so I just keep busy as fuck a dude. Enjoy work. I love it. I love the satisfaction of um, I don't know, like making stuff and having people enjoy it. So you feel like, I mean, it seems like you love doing standup when I see her at the store and you're going up. Looks like you're having a great time, a great time hanging out with other comics. I love the comedy store. I love what the comedy store is. I love what it always has been. I love how it's had this resurgence. I love the fact that they don't let everybody in there.

Speaker 2:          00:06:14       Isn't that great? It is great. There's a lot of people that are trying to get in there and they're like, eh, we're good. Yeah. And there's a lot of comics that you think are great. Come. Mitzi had a weird thing like she didn't pass Louis, like, that's, that's crazy. And then there was gatekeeper Tommy there for a while who wouldn't pass, like was holding the torch for Mitzi and what her, you know, we needed a weird thing with black eyes, like the best dude. But then I'll just add a megan come in. I've been so polite.

Speaker 2:          00:06:47       But then I love the fact that like me and you get to hang out at that back bar like that. They made that for us was really fucking smart within the last two years they made this. If you guys don't know what we're talking about, the. They made this video room that was just a room in the back behind the kitchen. And he said, the comics love hanging out here. Let's create a special little backbar just for the comedians and their friends. And uh, we get to have conversations in there. And you had some weird thing somebody told me the other night when I was in there like, fucking some chick was in here taking pictures. She was filming. Oh yeah, you shouldn't be filming to Santinello. And I having a conversation. And Brian Red Band Carter filming. You can't do that. To do that, but if it's a private bar, yeah, like you're not even supposed to be back there unless you're a comic or a friend of a calmer.

Speaker 2:          00:07:36       Exactly. So, and that's great for us because, you know, none we light, I, I enjoy talking to people as much but sometimes just gets overwhelming. And then also I want to have a conversation with you or any of my friends are real one normal conversation where you can talk at length with somebody and you can't do that and it seems like you're getting interrupted nonstop. Just again, happy to. I'm still the type of guy after shows. I'll go out, say hello to everybody talk, you know, and uh, but when all my friends are around and that's one of the great parts about the comedy store. And again, the, another part about the comedy store is then you have to get past. He had to be a paid regular. Yeah. It is. Also, there's like, there's a bunch of hot spots there where you get stuck.

Speaker 2:          00:08:23       Like if you're trying to do your set and you're leaving the back bar and you're trying to get to the, oh, are you going through that hallway? You'll just get stuck by people with cameras. They just want to take pictures. They just wait. They just waiting like owls ready to swooped down and snatched a rabbit. They're just waiting, waiting, waiting, and there's al. Can I get a picture? Can I get a picture? And you're like, I got to do. I sat and like literally walk outside. Just real quiCk. Just real quick. Like walking to the staIrs. I've seen it. Yeah. It's like fucking crushed. It really is when it's at the comedy cellar in New York and the comedy store in los angeles

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       or the best comedy clubs in the country and if you're a comedy fan listening to this and you, you got to make the trip. They really do because it's words on tuesday night, wednesday night, thursday night. You're going to see an amazing show that could be in a stadium. Yeah. Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah. I mean some of the, the show someone, the lineups, like you guys have a show there next wednesday, all things comedy. You, bert kreischer, who else is on? No, I'm aCtually not even unexcIting. We go to Mexico. No, it's, it's burt and bill and then you know a couple other atc comics. the united see, but the last one we did. You did. And then sarah silverman was on it. It was so. It was used. Sera silverman, eddie pepitone like this great. Meg bearer was on that one. Yeah. Yeah. They're insane. Yeah, it was a.

Speaker 3:          00:09:43       It was. It's a great, great place to hang out and so I love that. I love doing standup and I love hanging out with my friends and that's a huge part. But you feel like you're distracting yourself with work. I brought something. You made a great point the other night because I, we were talking about having an assistant. You go, I don't want to be busy enough to have an assistant. I don't want to be that busy. When I get to assistant level in my car thinking about assistant, you take it down. Well, that's my manager. They came up to me and they said, we think you should get an assistant. I said, I'll, I'll definitely start doing less shit. I go, let's just stop doing whatever I'm doing that I'm doing too much, that I need an assistant to stop. And they're like, well, sometimes it's hard to get ahold of yoga.

Speaker 3:          00:10:25       Well that's on purpose. Like do you understand that? Like bill murrAy has a one 800 number. They. Because they. Yeah. If you want to get ahold of bill murray, you get the one 800 number and then maybe he'll call you back. really? Yep. So people leave messages on the one 800 number or something? Yeah. If you're. I mean if you're calling about him being in a major motion picture, that's how you get ahold of the filmer. Will bill murray apparently checked out of relationships a few years ago? We said no more relationships. I don't want a girlfriend. I don't want a wife. I'm done. He has a kid. I guess apparently it's got an older kid checked out and he moved to like North Carolina or South Carolina, lIke one of those fucking places and anthony bordain interviewed him on his show, you know, we had him on the show and he's like, what are you doing down here?

Speaker 3:          00:11:12       And he's like, I love it. It's great. Please call. nice. Yeah. And he also, for a while I was living in upstate New York, like up the hudson who would live up there. Same sort of deal. Just just I'm done like I'm just going to live in weird spots and I'm by myself. So that's another reason why I'm working my ass off is I want that I'm done, fuck you money and I want to be able to chill out. I got kids on the back end of this thing where they're almost out of the house. Like I'm looking forward to that where they're both going to be in college and trying to get these little fuckers ready for life to the point where they don't need to come back because you hear a lot of people who are living in their homes with their parents until they're 30 and later. What the fuck is that? Not acceptable. I'm

Speaker 2:          00:11:53       going to push you out the door now. Someone is 36. Not good. Yeah. What will they're making? Life is too good, I guess. Yeah, it's too easy. Yeah, there's no. I was listening to dr. Drew talk about this on a howard stern ramp up show and he was saying like, kids don't have grit. Grit, grit. Oh, associate. Dr drew with grit. Well, you're Just, you know, he knows about a hustle, hustle and he goes, my kids are coddled, but he thinks the only thing is the educational system pushing education, make somebody work their ass off if you don't have that inner drive. And the reason like getting with me, and this was world, so if I, I don't see a therapist, I probably should because they got a lot going on, but fucking my mom was cleaning houses and making $6 an hour. My dad, teamster, warehouse foreman and uh, they were poor growing up, lower middle class and then went to the school.

Speaker 2:          00:12:57       He sent me to school in san francisco with all these rich kids as well as in all these rich houses and houses in people who know san francisco is pacific heights is really nice and sold it now it's like fucking $12,000,000 houses. And that's where we were hanging out. Parents would have abandoned them on the weekends and we'd have run of these fucking houses. Just crazy. Like my buddy broke a $25,000 vase and sort of like, let's get the fuck outta here. We'll pay for it. And we were in all these. I was like smoking some guys, cubans on sitting in his chair. I'm a kid from the inner sunset district who shouldn't be all of these places. But I think that's what lit a fire under my aunts because I'm working for the. My mom eventually has this great rags to riches story where she was working at this company and then she became an account rep and then she became the head account rep.

Speaker 2:          00:13:49       Then she began to vice president. Then she bought the company and quadrupled the company in size. Wow. And that's where I went to work for her. Even though I wanted to be a standup comic, I go to work for her. I am firing people for living, which is a whole nother fucking thing. And Just say I really was forced into this very tough. My dad and my mom were very fucking brutal. Half mexican, half sicilian. That's an I am. And then my mom is sicilian, like just the youngest sister in a with all boys in the family. Just a brutal lady who's like, can't tell me how I tell you how many times she said like, fuck, I'm just fuck them. Like, okay, they're going to come know just a client given her shit. Like, nah, fuck them. And they don't appreciate me. Fuck you.

Speaker 2:          00:14:43       So was like that with us and then my dad, same thing, they found each other for a reason because they both have that attitude and so I was there and then I was supposed to be this eldest son taking over this family business. So when I met you in 1999, you came up to my apartment which was in telegraph. It was a nice fucking apartment and I'm like the opener with a great place. And I lived. I had a wet bar. Remember? Okay. Can spot. Yeah, we smoked pot and watch old. Oprah's oprah's whether she had big hair, huge hair, no work done at all. Just old oprah or just baked watching fucking old oprah. I hadn't even met, like I had just met my wife at that point. And so this is. Yes, it's 1999. And um, I was working a regular job so I would do shows on the weekend hosts the cops or the punchline and go right back to work.

Speaker 2:          00:15:36       And at one point I think I remember the world started to collide. Like I'm doing standup and I look out, everybody's laughing except like three dudes with their arms crossed. I'm like, oh shit. Fire those fucking. Yeah. All the time dudes that you fired were sitting in the audience said that you started to make it into standard. Like they go to see, you know, I don't think it happened and we found me, you know? Wow. They must've been fucking steaming. Yeah. Just like, fuck that guy. Everybody's laughing, having a good set and look at just one dude fucking scowling at me. So creepy was that didn't mind. Fuck you. Yeah. Yeah. Know what? I had such a good attitude at that point. I was like, hey fellas. Now it's a little weird. Huh? Did you talk about it? Yeah. Oh jesus. I definitely acknowledged them and said hello.

Speaker 2:          00:16:21       Like I knew their names and you didn't say like, hey, I fired either until I can to everybody in the entire room, which I probably would do now. Not experienced enough to handle it when I met you. How long had you been doing standup? A year. Oh wow, that's crazy. I just said a. My 19th anniversary was on a tuesday. Wow, that's crazy. First tuesday in may. When did my first set went up in front of like half homeless people in san francisco at cobb's? No, at this place called the luggage store, which was on market street. Wow. Tenderloin. Full tenderloin. Walked up. I worked with you the first time I did the old cops. Yeah. That place was great. We got matched up because it was tom sawyer used to like to like he would make matches of he really pr. I was. He would pride himself in creating lineups that people would.

Speaker 2:          00:17:16       People would go together and let me just tell you something. It worked once with you. That's it. All the other times were a fucking disaster where it's like, even when I was up there, because I'd find it, I'm like, hey, what's up? He's like, fuck, is this guy just totally. I can. Yeah, you put me with this fucking asshole. Oh yeah, yeah. He put me with some, you know, there's some people that you think have potential and then they just don't, you know, we've all, we met guys like that. I mean there's a few guys that I could use to come up with used to come. But I opened for you. It was maddie kirsch. Alright, sure. And then eddie

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       bravo fucking came on. Well he'd come to hang out. Ain't know what he was doing, any standup, but he was like a totally come to hang. And then um, I think it was down here that I met brian and then brian started going around. What's you there? Super early on? Yeah. That was when I was down in here in like 2004 and dunkin. But that was the new cops as once they started moving to the new spot in the old one. I think it was just mad. Yeah. Maddie kirsch. Yeah. Early days, like maddie curse stopped doing standup for a long time. I think he's done. I think he just completely stopped and he stopped. He started doing tv stuff. He stopped doing standup and then he went back to it again. But I never saw them, you know, I think he's done. Yeah, I don't think you can dick around with it.

Speaker 3:          00:18:33       I was with me and my buddies were watching tim allen come back and you know what I did? He was such a nice guy and he watched and he watched my sat and came up and said bunch of stuff afterwards. He was super cool to me and it was so rough watching the set. This was like, he made all these santa claus movies and he made all this shit and me and kevin christie sent and about the. I said, you know what, let's do something to this guy. And we wrote them nine pages of jokes and fucking just go here. You go. And handed them to him really? And he goes, thank you. Oh my god. And then we came back the next night and he did a bunch of this shit and got an applause break. And one of my wife felt so good.

Speaker 3:          00:19:14       So cool. That's. I saw him one night at the comedy store when he hadn't done standup in for ever. And he came back and he was doing a joke about his ferrari breaking down. A lot of people can relate to it and listen to them. Don't ever just don't do that. I don't care if it's about a ferrari breaking down. Don't tell everybody you have a $250,000 car. Well that's a big george carlin thing is that when he got. So we'll see an ied. People going to the post office for him. He's like, I can't do the post office, but now because I don't even go to the fucking post office and I can't talk about the bank because I never go to the bank for myself. I say like you got to do all your own shit and just stay relatable. It goes the other way too.

Speaker 3:          00:19:55       I was in New York and when I was out there in the comic goes up and he was like, he goes, you know what? He's doing angel dust. Like nobody knows. Nobody knows what you're doing. Fucking angel dust. What are you talking about? Talking about a niche audience. Yeah, totally. So you know, stand up like matt jumped out and it's like, I don't think you can jump out like it's one of those things when you're 10, but god damn you love it. Like dana gould jumped out for a long time and wrote for the simpsons came back. You can do it. But you know, arguably dana gould should have been a huge superstar as a stand up comedian using a san francisco guy who was like, I listened to. If you guys don't know that comic is, I mean again, go find it because so good. So many voices, so many characters. So smart stories. Like why met him in boston? 80 eight, holy shit. And he was already big then like he was a headliner then and I'm doing really well.

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       He was like rodney dangerfield, young comedian, special, big, right? Like he was a, he had a showtime special. I remember that. He had a showtime special before I moved to la because I remember watching it and it was really interesting was the way he did. It was like kind of unique to a shot. it was unique and it was good. It was really good and I was like, this guy is going to be giant and I figured it was going to be like from their hbo specials, from their giant theaters. From there, you know, he was going to go the Brian Regan route, you know, we're selling out all of these places, but it just married the, the woman who became ended up becoming the president of hbo. Done. Good.

Speaker 2:          00:21:27       OnLy I have another thing. One headshot per household. Yes, dude, if you see like two, I think tom segura and christina are the ones that can pull it off to the only ones. Yeah. I've not seen anyone else do this successfully and I'm still standing back like this on that one. Blow up. You got this. You got it. All right. Well there was a kid on the daily show that him and his wife audition for the daily show at the same time and he got it and she didn't. Oh yeah. In fun time in that house. Not good. Not good at all. If somebody starts becoming super popular and then the other person is like, oh, what do I do? Do I present that kirsch do like jump out now or find other work and that's also been a difficult thing with me. So back to what we were talking about and it's like, so now I leave this parent's family business and I come to la, I could have again, I could have been up there and miserable fucking with firing people nonstop and taking on other people's problems because that's what I did is like if you have a business or you work somewhere, we'd employ everybody working there.

Speaker 2:          00:22:37       So You didn't have to deal with any of the headaches. But then I got all the headaches so I've been chased like a. I had a guy who was a time when knees, like he sick this banner. He was working in a doctor's office, but on the weekends we found out he was pretending he was the doctor. Are you seeing patients? His own patients? But he was a physical therapy and uh, um, orthopedists office. So I go in there and I've been doing this awhile. And again, no, just been in so many awkward situations. Now I'm doing stand up and I'm even more awkward situations and I just go up and I go, hey twon, you know, jig is up. Go. Today's your last day. We found out what you're doing. He grabs me, puts me up against the wall, he gets one of those physical therapy sticks, you know, the big, like the pole that you stretch with behind your back and stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:23:29       And he has one of those cut In half and he sticks it right up to my throat and now I'm cool. And so I go, twan, I got you got two choices here. You're going to hit me with that stick and I'm going to call the cops and I'm going to charges. you're going to go to jail. Does that mean to be pissy? Hit me with that fucking stick. Or you can take the final check that's in my breast pocket right here and walk away. What's it going to be? and I'm held up against a wall by my throat with the fucking stick in my face. And so had some crazy situation. So what did you say to him? You said the jig is up. I know you're not a real doctor. Yeah. I go, hey, how you doing? You shouldn't be here right now know you're seeing response. No, this is not true. These, you know, like in july we spoke english. Yeah. She's a physical therapist bangiNg chicks to. I have no idea. I would like it to be that waY. Yeah. That's a better story if there's a way to heal you.

Speaker 2:          00:24:27       So I didn't rush it. Nurses running from me and just crazy stories like why would they try to do to you? Uh, well this russian nurse was in an allergist office and she was giving wrong doses to the kids and stuff of shots. Oh jeez. All my documentation like these yellow pads. I goes, there's um, who you can see, right? I'm 22 years old. you can see right here. Then she tries to grab it. Now it's a tug of war across a desk and I don't know what the fuck is going on. And um, she takes off and runs down a haLlway and I'm 22 and shit. I fucking run down the hAllway afterwards and she goes into a patient room and didn't. She locks the door and then I get the door open and assist somebody unlock and she's in there and she's talking to her husband on the phone. she goes through, there is a mum here who's telling me lies. He's telling me like

Speaker 4:          00:25:14       I didn't want them to you, these pregnant and the baby because of these moms like that. I'm going totally

Speaker 2:          00:25:24       freaking out. Oh my god. I had a tea to teach. A bunch of vietnamese people had to. Shit. There was one day I got a call, got a call from this guy. The issue. Well they were her mungs. Okay. You know her mom is like this. If you saw grand torino, that movie with clint eastwood, I think the h is silent, I think. Right? The a h, m o, u n g, and then there are people without a land. Yeah. And then they go. Came to san jose, California to working assembly plants. So they're in this cable assembly plant, a plant called cable co. That was a big client of ours and I got a call from this really cool guy, his name is chip, chip bronc, and he goes, well you got to get down here, you're not going to fucking believe it. And I got a situation and I go, what is it? And it goes better. you see going into the bathroom. Shit everywhere. What? Because they had never been used to toilets. So they were standing on the toilet seats. I found out that's what was going on. They all had fake names, like the names, food, cli, but you can call me keith.

Speaker 2:          00:26:34       Hey keith fluidly. Can you come here for a second? Can I start you about this shit everywhere. Like on the ground? Yeah, they were missing. So toilet seat is not meant to fucking hold you up. So they're waddling up there standing on the standing on the toilet. So they were just used to like shitting and shitting and holes. Oh my god, they're lucky, you know, in the woods or whatever. So, so lucky. Not lucky where they hold them forever. So yeah, just backed up his becomes a brick. Yeah. So, um, anyway, I gathered everybody around, I just appointed a bathroom monitor and oh my god, bathroom monitors. So I had one of the guys who was the supervisor, I had a clipboard, I put a lock on the bathroom door and then. so you become this corporate fixer. That's what I was doing and I always wanted to do standup comedy.

Speaker 2:          00:27:24       I love standup comedy. I grew up in the city which is listening to the comedians on the radio and all the great comics was to comics who lived on my block. And so I love lived on your block. Mike pritchard and michael. Me and two great comics. Mike pritchard, one the first san francisco comedy competition. And robin williams looked up to him. He was like robin williams. That was his idol and he was on my block. And you don't money hoffman. Yeah, money. Hoffman. I'll be eight years old on my bike and I'd ride down the block and money. Hoffman and mike pritchard used to put their tee shirts over their heads. You know how you can do with just the, the whole face pops out of the hole. And they used to pretend they were the California raisin guys. You guys are hilarious. This is amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:28:06       They lived on your block on my block. And I remember. Where's pritchard now? I think he's a motivational speaker. is still up in the bay area. Lead lives in marin. He came To the last night at cobb's comedy club in that little spot. Why you stopped doing standup? I just speaks. Wow. Weird. Yeah. So, um, well, you know, that's another tempting thing for me too is because I do a ton of corporate standup, I get you can get paid, you know, five figures to deep five figures to speak at 3:30 PM and do stand up at a thing and you know, if your standup career, like you're in a good, amazing spot because people come to see you. Like I'm still at the stage where I go out and 40 percent other people, they're come to cv and it's a weird cross section of people who love stand up or you know, heard me, you heard me on burt's podcasts or your podcast, you know, whaTever.

Speaker 2:          00:29:02       And then it's a weird cross section, a daily show people and then sitcom people and then, you know what I mean? It's like this weird crowd coming together. and then it's um, it's people like comedy. It said stan hope bit people. How many people came here to see me and, and when many people came here to see comedy. Yeah. And he's like, music isn't like that. And so for me to do a corporate gig and pay get paid double gazillion, you know, like a lot of money is fucking tempting to switch over to that side. So I could see why people do that. That's what jay leno did. You just get paid 250 grand and that's why he doesn't put out any content. Jay. Oh. Doesn't have the same act he has. No, he has no body of Work. Like he had a showtime special that he did that I saw in the nineties and I'm pretty sure other than his tonight show monologues, which of course has numerous.

Speaker 2:          00:29:54       I think that's the last stand up. Did he ever put out as far as like a, like a full act? Talk to him about it. yeah. He's kind of weird philosophy about it. I did random, randomly got a phone call to present him with his mark twain award at the kennedy center. Oh wow. It was me fucking seinfeld, jimmy fallon, seTh meyers. I'm like crazy people. It's, you know, wanda sykes and I had no business being there. Chelsea handler was doing whatever, just like an all stars and I'd never met him before and I think they just wanted to color it up, but I'm going to say yes because it's fucking kennedy center and super super cool. And I got there and I meet them for the first time and then my act was like, what are you doing? Like you have $250,000,000 or something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:30:50       And You still, every sunday you go to the comedy magic club, you don't turn over your act. You got separate comedy, money in tv, money in this car collection. I go, what, what do you like? Just chill out, man. Yeah. And uh, I, can you give me the fucking $4,000,000? You never see me again? And it goes sold from the balcony and then we had a long conversation about it afterwards, which was super weird and talked about that exact same thing that you just discussed is that he has an act that he wants to keep doing and if it never appears on tv, you've got to go see him to see it. But people get mad when they see him twice. Oh yeah. Like uh, he was in edmonton. He did the river cree and then he did it again a year later and he did the same act.

Speaker 2:          00:31:42       And uh, the people that were mad. Well that's just, I mean, for, for those old school guys, that's how you did it. I mean, it's not a no knock against him. That's how everybody did it. It can't skills guys and vaudeville, they build. Those guys would do the same act for 10 years. And it was also, you could do other people's asks. Yes. Right. Yeah, they just did. They have did that, you know, they will social media when the abbott and costello did who's on first on tv 20 other guys were pissed because they also did that exact same bit. Really? Yeah. And they're like, thanks a lot fellas. I could never fucking do that thing. And so who's on first? Wasn't an abbott and costello original. Was there 20 other duets doing that exact same fucking material? Wow. Yeah. So now let's complete jay leno courses carrying that.

Speaker 2:          00:32:43       You're pissed. When I started in san francisco is great guy. Jimmy cornet who ran the punchline, we were talking about other people coming through and not changing their act and he goes, dude, you need a new 20 minutes. At least every time we come through here people are going to be pissed. They want to see the hits. And this would obviously would say we go see the stones, you want to see brown sugar, but you got to mix in some fucking new shit every once in a while to comments or feel like they less want to see the hits more than anything with music. Like they actually just want to see the hits, like if you go to see the stones, they don't want to hear any new stones shifts once satisfaction. But if you go to see bird, you want to see all this new stuff. Yeah. You're familiar to. You saw his last netflix. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting. So that keeps us creative. It keeps you fresh. You have to constantly be hustling. Totally. Yeah. It's um, that's what I say when I saw you the other night when you did that atc show. You had that funny. No vagina bit.

Speaker 2:          00:33:50       Thanks man. That was because again, and that's another thing, it's like you grow up in san francisco when you become like, you see guys coming through and I watched, I went to see everybody. So I lived in between comms and the punchline and that's where I did. If you, you know, outliers 10,000 hours. Yeah. Walk to the cops. I know for. I did this for maybe 13 months straight almost every single night I walked the comps. Then I'd walk to the punchline and I saw every single act saw damon wayans. Carlos mitzia is scott, you know, for kids in the hall. What's his face? got to thompson said just anybody who would come through. I go see, I can see every single night and I want you to good ones. I took something from everybody, but then I sort of watched people come through a second time and not change anything.

Speaker 2:          00:34:35       I stopped to watch features that were better than the headliner and feature, you know, the conversation over in the corner and fucking just watching it all and it just again, you see what people are doing and how much work people put into this. It's a tremendous amount of work, but to do the bits also. And that's another thing is like san francisco, you wouldn't put hacky comics up. Right? They wouldn't get to play there. Sawyer wouldn't fucking work here for good reason. I really appreciated that about him. It's one of the reasons whY I was willing to go back and do his clubs so many times. Yeah. SO again, that's when you come to la and you're like, what the fuck is this? There's some of that like what we were talking about, we don't need to name any names, but that one person who just as a bunch of shit and says it fast and then you're like, okay, what?

Speaker 2:          00:35:25       What are you doing? You're ruining the night. There's a lot of tricks, tricks you're saying a bunch of pop culture references and a bunch of shit, but there's no like so hard to be judgmental about someone else's craft or art, but there's times when you know whether someone is actually trying to work something out or whether they're trying to trick the audience too. There's a bunch of stuff You guys that you can do to elicit laughter and you can memorize a huge string. It's called. Yeah, it's a string and you can just fucking rattled some done and then they got a big applause. Bah ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba. What? I did, what I did after that. What did you do this. I don't want to be like this. I just want to read, write and jack reacher on my deck and fucking chill out and I bought that fga 62 land cruiser and I want to fucking just, I want to get a little trailer behind that. I want to go to big sur with my wife's go chill out by the ocean. Chill out. Yeah. I want to be that guy, but you're not, but I'm not.

Speaker 2:          00:36:30       I'm not. I really want to be. Anyway, I followed that. Yeah. One comic we're talking about and I walked out and I go, how bad it I go, name. I go, what was that last applause? Break all about the offer to donate some money to charity. Just for no reason. You shouldn't have done it. Just shouldn't talk shit. well, I think the only time you should talk to is when someone's doing something negative. Like stealing. Yeah. You know, I mean we've all been there before. When you see someone go up and you go, okay, that's not even your act. Yeah. Yeah. It happens less now than ever before. Don't think this is like the cleanest time for comedy as far as like, you're still hear little stories pop up here and there, but I think it's also now it's subjective and there's lunch. So much standup.

Speaker 2:          00:37:22       I was thinking like I have this hour special coming out, um, this weekend on showtime and I think talking to somebody about it and there's a special coming out like every fucking two days. Yeah, they're not that special anymore or not, but it's a great time for content. Like if you want to see comedy, like you go on netflix or showtime or cso or any of these different providers to cecil. If I could stand then stand up special. And I watched the and mentioned it as they go. The doug stan hope special on. So if you have not seen this, I feel like is one of the best things I've ever seen. And I walked in to the comedy club and he saw punchline for the very first time and I saw arch barker onstage kill just, he's a great comic. He's just fucking murdered. And I had the same feeling that when I watched that doug stanhope special, oh, just I haven't seen it. I need to see it, my god, the bills just again. And it's like next level shit that I hope people can really appreciate the call backs and the intricacies of this Whole thing and the story in somebody who's on something and saying

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       something like. But doug did two of them in his hometown. He did them bolt in bisbee, right? Yeah. This is the one that was shot in bisbee by a head again. You know, it's just. I love the fact that he's doing that. like we talked about it a couple of years ago is I can park in my town. I just got to fucking see these people at the safe way. And then apparently he just said, fuck it, why not? Why can't I do it in my town? And then eventually his town stopped being the talent was. And as a bunch of people who moved there because they know doug lives there. Oh dude. First of all, he's a real estate mogul. He bought everY house that comes up. They're all like $30,000. He just buys it. He's just buying houses. So he owns like, I think you want six or seven houses in town. This is with jack reacher novel where he's going to own the town. Good time. Fuck dude. If I got divorced, I thought I'd seriously consider moving there. There's already a house I'm looking at. It's a cave. No way to indicate when it's Built into a cake. Oh yeah. Yeah. Now I can't buy it because people know they'll show up at my door.

Speaker 3:          00:39:40       But uh, he, uh, so many people move to bit. He used to give out his address and say, come into my superbowl party. So people would come from all over the world to his fucKing superbowl party. And it was ridiculous. It'd be 500 people that he didn't know at his house for a superbowl party. So he stopped doing that. He rescinded the invitation. That's what me and bert were talking about is doing a thing called a caravan comedy tour and getting a bunch of rvs and our trucks and trailers and just going a bunch of guys because also sudden it's like just a special kind of comic. You're, you're one of those comics. It's like you have give kids, you have a family of life, you have stuff outside of standup, you know, sake to get those guys together. And bert is one of those, you know, we're like, you have a couple kids and like get the kids and the wives, it takes a lot to be a comedian wife and they all have that in common, so I'm sure everyone would get along great because they have to deal with us and so the wives and the kids, everybody in rv and then we all go out and do shows and then everybody gets to go to the grand canyon, the next bad idea, bad idea.

Speaker 3:          00:40:50       And then duncan, we talked about dunkin doesn't have any kids. I know, but he's got a dog will be still be fun on the road. Yeah, that's a great idea man. So you know, I just wanted an excuse to buy one of those airstreams. Totally. I just think they look bad ass. Well I build upon your fj 62. Oh my god. I don't think I haven't been. I got business cards. I'm looking at. There's a place called off the grid rentals and just to test out, but it's too small. It's like this teardrop. It's a four by 14. So you can put a rooftop tent on top of it. Has the ladder that goes up. Yeah. And then I could just have everybody. I'm thinking I want a little bit more surreal one. Well I've been going to the differences. Sports mobile, if you go to sportsman will bill.com, which is fucking dirt.

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       They've been doing it for a long time but you can get one of those dodge sprinter vans, a diesel truck down and get that four by four it out and just go. And then you could still tell some stuff. So there's this company called fuck it. What is the company called? There's aN expedition vehicle that they take and they take like a ford f 2:50 and then they put this thing on top of the roof, lIke the like above the front cab. It goes up and then back know exactly what you're saying. It's got solar power and a generator and you can live in those fucking things. It's all ready to rock. There's a rock climber guys. Look at that fucking thing. Jesus christ. Oh my god. I'm in love with a rooftop tent. Yeah, and will they do that too? They take vans and there's a company called u joint off road.

Speaker 3:          00:42:24       They take a van like that. They remove the natural suspension or suspension that comes with it and put a full on dual solid axle. Four wheel drive suspension setup in. Uh huh. And you could just drive that motherfucker xmmobile.com and take a look at this now because this is what they used to do and they're still doing with some of these. The vans Will do this. That looks amazing words. But if you look at what they're doing with the mercedes and the dodge sprinter, that's when it just goes up to a whole nother level. Downsize other sites down. Oh yeah. But you can see soMe of them. Yeah. Like it just fucking. I like. Yep. I like it. I have those same ideas, but I do go on these trips for hunting where I go out in the woods five, six days at a time and most of the time there's no cell phone service.

Speaker 3:          00:43:14       I just did bordaiN, uh, with the crew that you guys shot with in Montana. Oh yeah. Yeah. What'd you do? I did his uh, no reservation. Yeah. Well it's called, um, what is it called now? Parts and parts unknown. Yeah. Where'd you go? What'd you do? We just say it was mexican food down on of street. Oh, nice. Nice. Yeah, we went bird hunting in Montana. It was fun. So interesting that, that guy's still goes hard. Yeah. Hard. Like I'm throwing them back. We got so high I thought I could feel the earth benning will. He had just come from. He was super late. I got drunk. If you watch this parts unknown, I'm fucking wasted up. People are like, why is that magical? His eyes closed kind of super drunk. He was four hours late and I just went to bars with that crew while we were waiting for him because he got a tattoo and then he showed up super late and then we ate to ketos and by the time he got there I was just trashed.

Speaker 3:          00:44:10       I'm the biggest lightweight of all time. It really is true. I did a show with you had the comedy magic club. We walked around the corner and got baked with red band and then I went back in and I had to apologize to your audience. I go, I've been so busy, been able to get back like I used to and it just fucking snuck up on me. I don't know what the fuck is going on. Where you can stock up. You could sneak up on you. Easy today. Yeah, and like people are productive. Doug benson is A producTive motherfuCker. He gets a lot done. I can't speak. I'll just leave that there.

Speaker 3:          00:44:52       Yeah, I get it. I mean, some people are much more comfortable with joey. Joey diaz is constantly in that state. I saw him who senT me a picture of it. If it was a. Somebody showed me something that he was in the noodles. Big gummy bear, dude, that has 3000, 300 milligrams milligrams of thc in that thing and you'd like chop the head off and he does that all the time that he stopped doing that though, by the way, joe. He stopped. He backed off the edibles. Oh really? Yeah, just tax. Oh yeah. Yeah. I can't, I have such. I'm been waking. I just went to the doctor. I a little bit of a health scare and this is two days ago, uh, because I've been waking up in the middle of the night out of breath. Yeah. Oh, you probably have sleep apnea at that or I get a sleep study that's being done and then I'm just saying I have anxiety and we definitely have anxiety.

Speaker 3:          00:45:41       Yeah, a lot of it. You ever thought about doing like yoga or anything? Um, I try to go to the gym. I go to the gYm every morning, but I don't like I need to meditate and people have talked to me about transcendental meditation and stuff like that that I need to settle the fuck down. YeAh, they. But you know that you have this thing and you're not doing anything. I'm not doing anything about it. And the doctor said that this is good. now you're finally being compelled to talk about it with Somebody that is a problem and you feel like you're angry at yourself for being so anxious. Because if I go to the airport with my wife and kidS, I could feel it. I feel my anxiety. I feel myself freaking the fuck out. Wow. When you freak out, like what's the thought?

Speaker 3:          00:46:25       What are you worried about? We got to get through and everybody slowing us down. I go early. I know that's what I started doing it. That's why I'm like trying to prepare myself was so huge. Just leave an hour earlier than you need to and you don't give a shit and I still look at my wife from like the last couple of times, like doing pretty good. I'm working on it. It's weird. It seems like maybe you were set up for this from like your early career, like this, like tension, you know, and then the desire for success like to be a successful comic is a lot of hustling and does a lot of life. You've got to fuckIng, you gotta be on your point. You got to be on your game. He had a look around, go, go, go, go. And now with atc again, I feel so much responsibility for all these comics and things. So we have 50 podcasts. We have 50 live comedian. That thing down for sure. I tried. That'S another thing where you getting calls. I did 20 percent at least. Right? Everybody's like, okay, here's, here's a perfect fucking example. Like ian edwards has a podcast called soccer comic.

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       I'm not going to. I love ian edwards to death. Right? [inaudible]. He's on that note. I don't care for people listening that fucking show. He's on that network. I don't. Okay. I don't give a shit. Yeah. I feel the same way and so I don't care about the numbers as much as I believe in the comics, likE there's two comedians, michael, constant, mike and chris fairbanks that I want to start making tv like they're not on tv. Costs is a funny dude. This is a funny motherfucker and I have a great story with costa. So um, this is how we met me and bill burr first comes to comedy store, sees me, we become friendly, then sees me onstage, did some bit about how my wife's half korean, half greek and I go, I might add this korean mother in law and I don't do any jokes about her because then I'd be doing margaret cho's jay, I act and who wants that

Speaker 5:          00:48:25       shithead fucking. He loves it and I can't. That's fucking hilarious.

Speaker 2:          00:48:37       We go now I'm at the point in la, you guys like I'm doing spots, I'm not doing anything else. And so I'm working on these tv shows as much as I can, but when I'm not, I'm at the comedy store two cents. Then I go to the laugh factory, then I go to the improv. I'm doing that triangle and I'm hitting them all and I had the ice house, like I'm going everywhere. I'M a guy who's doing like 12 sets a week and this is from 2004 until I get the daily show, pretty much like this is a good solid six or seven years of just fucking going and then go to the improv and bill again. New I go, let's go to the improv. It's fucking go down there. and so he jumps in my car. We drove down to the improv. It's a show that they're doing where they show a sketch comedy video and then they bring up a standup and then they show a sketch comedy video and a stand up and my cost as the host.

Speaker 2:          00:49:30       So I go up in between these sets and I look at them and I go, heY, do you know if they're going to show another video? Are they going to bring me up? And then he responds, I forget what he says, but then he goes up on stage and he goes, okay, this next comedian is, um, I guess it's al magic guy. If You want me to pronounce your name right, you got to come introduce yourself to me before the shit. I can'T be expected to this. I don't know if it's a guy or a girl and I'm on the side losing it and I go, fuck you. And he goes, what? I go, you heard me fuck this room full of asian night or something. Like there's all these chinese people there. And so I go, everybody turns and I go, you heard me?

Speaker 2:          00:50:12       Fuck you. I go do Your job. I introduced myself to you like, just get the fuck off stage. And I go, what? Because he's like, I don't know if it's a guy or a girl. Who are you going to go, dude, you're the fucking host. Figure it out, right asshole. So I walk up and I proceed to just lay into him. Just fucking 15 minutes are about the guy or girl, you're the host. It's all you have one fucking job to do. Bills hunched over, laughing on the side. we're going to. all the comics in the back are just. See there's tables In the back or on the floor. And it's the echo, it's fucking asian night. This is the worst crowd scenes that atlanta like just going crazy and I can't help it. Again, if anyone's listening to this guy's an asshole, I don't want to be.

Speaker 2:          00:51:06       I want to do that. right. It just came out compelled uncontrollable fucking burst of fucking telling people this asshole continuous. Yeah. Right, right. Yeah. And I could've, I could've gone. I'm right here. Sorry about that. Magical, magical. no problem. Just bring me up. Yeah. But that puts you in a bad position. You go up there like sort of. Yeah. Like they can submitting. Yeah. It's willie barcelona had those storIes about like headbutting somebody in the hallway because they brought up charles fleischer instead of him. You know, he will. It's crazy. Well, yeah, that's a whole nother thing. Like, I think I told that story last time I was on his podcast were I told him to fuck off and he's an east la street fighter. So I. Yeah, it doesn't matter. I don't think when I see red they fucking started telling everybody, fuck you.

Speaker 2:          00:51:58       So anyway, I'm being my costa. Very good friends. To this day I came up, I mean, I see the error of my ways right away and I go, apologize and go deal. Can't control It. I'm sorry. I see crazy shit people. And so again, when you and I have never had a weirdness, weird moment happens with very few people, but when it does, when you feel slighted. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've never slighted you like, and if you. No, no you haven't. Yeah. But yeah. I don't know. Again, I want to just, just to, uh, consider. I know that feeling though. There's a feeling, especially like the anxiety before you're performing, you're, you're ready to go. And then someone that you feel lIke someone's fucking with you and you're like, oh, okay. I've had that happen before where a host will purposely say some dickie things about you thinking they're going to chop down your set.

Speaker 2:          00:52:50       I've done the same thing. I just go after him. Upset. Totally. Yeah. Um, who's in brendan schaub told me the stories like he to people because, you know, he's a big guy and a stand up new standards and somebody went up on stage at the improv and he said, um, he said, who the fuck is that guy? Like, you can't be that handsome fucking started just tearing into them for being like, this isn't a fighter too for you. Yeah. Well those erik griffin was it? Yeah, he was just fucking around. Yeah, it was just like, that's what you say, you know, the guy

Speaker 3:          00:53:25       goes up and he does stand up and he's got this perfect haircut and you're like, hey, fuck you. You know, eric goes up with the spare tire rod is waste is a big jolly guy fuck out of here with this fatty with glasses and a mustache mustache. So he looks like he puts on the glasses and mustache together today. It's like when he was doing that, I was trying to tell brendan, I go, dude, that's what we do. I go, you got to understand that like you go up, you do your set, the guys can shit on you. You know what I mean? That's like I would have shit on youtube probably. Especially in New York, same thing. Oh, you fucking whore in New York anymore. If you don't do two or three minutes of what's going on in the room and what just happened, you're going to have his shitty set like that's I would.

Speaker 3:          00:54:12       That's what I learned right away. You have to Be like, you know, start of hugging, hold everyone's attention and just start launching into material to comment on what's happening. You know what that is from. I noticed that too when I lived in New York, I was like this because the crowds are small and the stage is small. It's way more intimate experience. It's like the belly room, you know? The belly room is a totally different experience in the or, which is a totally different experience in the main room. It's one of the beautiful things about doing the hat trick of the comedy store. if you do all three rooms in a night, you get to feel the different. Like the belly room is so much more intimate and so much more intense because there's only 70 people in the room and they're jammed in there and they're right in front of you.

Speaker 3:          00:54:51       And that's like in New York room. so I'm doing that. That show on showtime about standup comedy. I'm dying up here. You get to meet that guy in the back. That's helping me. He's making that show. And we were talking about the belly room and interviewing people about that just to figure it out. And that used to be, it was called a billy room because it was for women. And then like at pregnant women, you know, like a womb. Mitsui literally thought of it as a comedy womb. Yep. Yeah. And then they used to put overflow. So if richard pryor, somebody huge was in the main room, they put all the overflow up in the belly room and then a comic would be on stage and they'd come in if like a table opened up, they'd go mid, mid act thompson party for like you, you're doing stand up onstage.

Speaker 3:          00:55:40       And the waItress would come in and go at the thompson's here and then the thompson's ever sitting in the front and they just get up and walk out and go to see richard pryor so that place, you know. And then I worked on that with erik griffin so I didn't really know him that well before and hilarious just fucking fucks with people nonstop. so of course he was the guy that said that shit, but he's a great dude. He's a nice guy. He's not doing it because he's an asshole. He's just being silly. That's what I was trying to tell brendan. He's like, you wouldn't hit me hard bro. And I'm like, that's what we do. You like brendan's new to this whole world, you know, because he started out doing podcasts. He's a funnY guy. And then he started doing these live podcasts with cal and then they would do sort of like a little sketch, like a comedy routine.

Speaker 3:          00:56:26       and then he would do a few minutes on his own just doing like kind of standup, like telling his story. And he's funny. He says he has some funny ideas. So now he's doing sets like on a regular basis and then he's doing sets in front of people don't know which is the right way to do it. Totally. The bad things that people do is they only do their own crowd over and over and over again. Not smart. You got to go out and do those shows that I was trying to. Like when you start doing standup comedy, you invite all your friends out and it takes you three sets to figure out, oh shit, I better stop inviting my friends that do it. Well and not only that, but if you invite your friends out and they're a significant part of the audience, they've already seen your jokes.

Speaker 3:          00:57:06       Yeah, exactly. It's just goes bad right away and you're like, oh, I want to make strangers laugh. I want to make a complete strangers like and if I can do that and it just makes you a better comic. I got a bunch of shit and we were talking about this building. I got a bunch of shit for fucking heckling. Steevo an attitude, heckle them in the audience, the improv. I was on stage, I told the story, I said, I don't again, I don't want to be this guy. I really don't. You don't understand that it is a problem and I'm trying to. I'm going to go to a cognitive behavioral. This what the doctor prescribed me is cognitive behavioral specialists is gonna stop me from doing shit like this. ReallY? Yeah. But, uh, I said, uh, I don't feel bad, that bad event, this. I said, um, he was in the audience and I said, alriGht, I go, I don't want to care about standup this much.

Speaker 3:          00:57:55       I really don't. I'm so passionate about this. you guys don't fucking understand. Like I take so and so stole this joke and stole that joke and I go, I just got to come to grips with the fact that what I feel like is my life's calling is somebody else's last resort. And then, because I told you about like dustin diamond to stand up, I go fucking, uh, you know, skippy from family times does stand up like, and then people don't even know what that is anymore. I know. Does he still do it? Skippy? Yeah, I think so. That's the diamond was in jail and stab somebody. Yeah. Yeah, tell he was doing stand up. He was lIke a family ties sort of ended. He was doing standup when I was an open mic or I was just starting out and he was headlining in these places and that's, you know, he had this big smile, skippy from family ties and he just would go on the road, but I never heard from him again.

Speaker 3:          00:58:50       Yeah, I wonder what that guy's doing. There's kind of at some point the audience just goes away and then people stopped booking you and then you have to go away. I guess. What do you do a job? I guess? Hopefully you invested your money properly and some real estate. Skippy. Skippy is just a real estate baron Who talks me down and has callen has talked me down a couple of tImes. He's like, no, just relax. He's a nice guy. Don't worry about it counts as a calm guy. Yeah. But you know, the thing is like it is your life calling and for some people it isn't. Some people, it's like something that came along after they had been doing a bunch of other stuff, but that's okay. Yeah, whatever. Who cares? There's an audience for a lot of people will say like, that guy's not really comic. Like if you're doing stand up your comic and although most of them don't ever become comics, you respect. It's not like it's outside the realm of possibility that you could do it or I could do it. How come they can't do it? Somebody said this about carrot top, like that fucker carried around say what you will. But that fucking carried around that bag fucking time. Not only that, he, he monopolize that genre. That was a legit genre. When we started out. You remember like there were prop comics. I'm buddies with rusty.

Speaker 3:          01:00:02       Rusty do. It was a problem. Yeah, but there's no prop comics anymore. that's and carrot top. He killed the genre. Wow. Dude. When I first started in 88, there was a. you would have a prop comic on every other show. Three or four shows. You do three or four shows. One of those shows. How would have a prop comic con it now? They don't exist anymore, so I really feel like in this. I'm dying up here. We did a good job of bringing all that stuff back and this is nice. Set. Nineteen, 73 weekend on a ventriloquist is. I can't Wait for you to see the show. The other thing, there's no more. Ventral goes. Who killed that? I'm probably dual. Jeff dunham. Yes. He owns it. He owns it. He owns it. And then there was. You saw otto and george. I worked with auto times many times.

Speaker 3:          01:00:49       We did prom shows together in New York. Oh my god. Tell me. People don't know what auto in Georgia, so you can. Maybe you can explain it as you worked with them because I saw the puppet would say the most vicious, vile, racist shit and then he would go, I can't believe you're saying that. And you'd go, hey, look at that fucking ladies. Yeah. It was just walking the entire room. He would say ruthless, ruthless shit. He was a great guy to dead. Yeah. He died and I'm a sawyer. Had them in that small room and we watched tourist after tours walkaway and tom looked at me and the rest of the comics who again, or just hunched over on the floor and he goes, I'm losing money this weekend guys, but this is for us. That's great. yeah, and his act was ridiculous. We did a. We did jersey shore shows for this guy. Pop gonzo. We did a. I did a lot of shows with auto. They go looking for horse and crack. Oh, he would go. He would go off. Yeah, he would get crazy here. We get crazy. You have through sending. So we ended up with ventriloquist in the show. Kind of like the petty fights. Like I get to write on it, so I got to incorporate all my fucking weirdness in there and like a petty bullshit. Bad intro. Fuck you.

Speaker 3:          01:02:08       Well you guys also got 19 seventies wardrobe and hair, which is fucking bad ass. I saw some photos of it. my daughter walked out to me and I'm onset. Didn't say anything about my hair. I'm not going to biggest mustache you. I'll post a picture of just dragging them. I think it's on, it's online. Jamie could probably find it. Um, huge real mustache. Big side burns and that our mind. And then this wig, my daughter walks up, she goes, why are you wearing a towel? Terry? Cloth towels. They bother. Why is your shirt made out of a towel? I don't understand. As kids growing up, how were your kids who had grown up with like do they know stand up comic debt? Like they're figuring it out? Yeah. I brought my uh, living in New York, brought practicing for a comedy central special that I don't think one person saw and I go an hour half hour.

Speaker 3:          01:03:04       When did you do it? I did in 2014. Two thousand 13 or something that gave you, once you started doing the daily show, early show special came out and how many times they were having crying. Just fuckIng midnight on a friday. Those motherfuckers you burn a special with them. Yeah, it's a problem. Well, you know what? And then they're like, but you can catch It online at comedy central. Dr. But he companies going there, no one is going there, it's not happening to them to do, to netflix, sell them to netflix or have a billboard, really have a campaIgn that says dave attell, jim gaffigan, jill rogue, like all these names of just every comic that you love and watch all available here. Two dollars. Like, you know, what are some like just not going to do that because no one's going to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:03:48       They're not like you have to have something on a platform that people are already used to. Cecil, you have amazon, you have netflix and you know, like apple, that's it. No one else is going anywhere else. It's just not going to happen. Yeah. It's too easy to do those things. So anyway, to be burned that special. Anyway. So, uh, I am practicing for that. I go up to rochester, New York, bring my wife and kids with me and we stay in a holiday inn and suites and this is a six year old little girl, goes over to the curtains, opens them up, and she goes, I'm, why am I looking at the parking lot? I go, everybody gather around. ThIs is the road. Okay, that's what I do. This is what daddy does, so when you think I'm having a great time flying around, it really gets sad. We're going to fight a businessman for a waffle tomorrow morning. Everybody shut up those rochester road gigs. Rough like those spots where people don't necessarily want to go. Albany. Rochester, well yeah. It was a bar. It is attached to a country western bar called daisy dukes. Oh, jesus looked that up. It a place in in youngstown, Ohio that I did that was a to a disco and there was a back door and every time the back door would open up, like when people would go to the bathroom here and the door would slowly close.

Speaker 2:          01:05:20       Okay. So it was rough. I did this place, laughs in kirkland, Washington, Washington, and I go there and I'm doing this again if you want. She's like longer stories, tangents, characters, shit like that. For the most part, like my closer is 25 minutes long and this special. It starts wIth this 2014. No, this is the one I'm doing right now that comes down to, thIs comes out this week and 20 minutes long, so it's this big long fucking bit that I've been working on forever about revenge and my anger. I did see food revenge. I shrimped the place. That's what it's called. Shrimp in an easy. So I'm a fucking. Just a mess and I'm. Well I forgot I just got off track. I forgot what I was talking about. The road open up the parking lot, fighting someone over a waterfall. Kirkland, Washington so, so at kirkland hand a big long in the middle of a big long story and they bring out these trays that have neon lights around them with jello shots on him and they and they and everybody in the entire audience looks at these trays there. They look like ufo was. They got jello shots on him and I go, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to interrupt. Is a crafted a bit that took me fIve years to master to bring you in.

Speaker 6:          01:06:39       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:06:42       Who wants a jello shot? Lets everybody do jello shots. Ladies and gentlemen. Jello shot time. and I just started fucking selling the shit out of jello shots as a bit because I'm like, this guy fucked up like this. I need everyone concentrating. Ideal is printing it out. The owner and the waitresses are bringing out these trays. Just ufo trays. The jello shots at a comedy club at a comedy club. Lose every single person in the audience. It's A standard thing. They do, I guess. So I just went with it and what they do at the end of the night to wrap up, there's just a big push in the night. We're going to get some extra dollars in our coffers. Believe it was happening. I was shocked at the time and then the owner comes up like I was serious. And he goes, holy shit. He goes, we sold out of jello shots. You were amazing. That was unbelievable. And then I walk into the next night who's got more jello shots? I mean the kitchen is filled with them and those jello shots come out. And I don't say a thing.

Speaker 2:          01:07:38       Siri. I thought we were a business together. We had a good thing going on. I don't know if you know this because he didn't mention he didn't mention the jello shots. What are you doing? I go, yeah, I really, I don't know if you could tell by really hate the fucking jello shots like I go. It was just, it was horrible. You should not be selling them. I don't know. It's a huge distraction. What did he say? It was just to teach you a lesson. Like a fucking sell any jello shots now. You weren't pushing them? No. Zero. No. so he just had a huge, like he should probably explained that to him. Yeah, on the first night and then he would have got it, but he probably still would have sold them anyway. He made money and he was a nice guy and it was nice, like it was just like it.

Speaker 2:          01:08:21       I don't know man, like I can't. It's hard for me to do. And again, if you have people coming out that know you and you're going out to see something in you like collectively or group of people that love an individual comic, it's a great place to be. But again, if you're up there winning over 60 percent of the audience, not good, but rather just go hang out at the store. Well, it's good to do the road though because like you can. I think like every time you do a set in a new place, you got a new experience, a new vibe, a new feel, new crowds. New I like. I think places also have like a different personality. Like I feel like portland, Oregon has a different personality than a lot of places. Like you go up to portland and feels different, the audience feels different and then you go to austin, Texas different feeling like a little lighter.

Speaker 2:          01:09:13       They're little lighter, a little more fun. It's more silly. I like doing shows in Canada, in toronto. One of the best sets I've ever had my entire fucking life. Toronto, vancouver is fun for me to go to. Canadians are just great audiences. I don't know what it is to just. It's loose. They're not uptight about 20 percent less douchebags. Really? Yeah. That's my theory about Canada. They have 20 percent less douche bags and it must be what it is. There's aLways fun. Yeah, but they have 20 percent less as in that vancouver. A calculated metrics of comedy mix. Yeah. Great spot. Awesome spot. And you go right to your hotel. You go, it's in the hotel. If you go down, down to the bottom floor, walk right into the club. All clubs, underground comedy works, dcm, prive. If you live at a bad old copies that we talked about. All these great places. Yep. I'll just underground comedy club, but there's something about it. It's just fun. Anyway, so, um, I think there's three guys in the front row and I look at them and they keep going on in the bathroom, like you just do coca and we look at the bounce around. I like these guys are clearly doing coke. No one you shot him in the front row and then because. Well they paid to sit in the front row. That's a koch money.

Speaker 2:          01:10:31       Well, vancouver is a big coke town. Really? Yeah. It's a big weed town, but it's aLso a big coke town. They, um, I was one of the points where I had sunday night after that said, and I go after that weekend, it's the last sentence. I'm hanging out with this great comic up there, graeme clark and Bearded guy looks like de young santa claus, like all, you know, vancouver coMics and we go and we're having drinks at a bar and you're buying and these two girls send over these two shots of Jack Daniels and um, he's not attractive fella. I'm no brenton job and so we go run yet really? Or they look over our shoulders. This for us. Okay. It must've been at the show. That's it must've been to jump. They weren't at the show. We're, there's a lot of chicks in that town.

Speaker 2:          01:11:25       Maybe they wanted you to liver. Yeah, that's what I was thinking, that I immediately go to fucking me in the bathtub. no, oregon's wake up on you. Totally. I'm very suspicious because rocking her wedding ring. exactly. Not people's sexiest man alive, you know. So I can, my wife is very attractive, but I'm not pulling any chicks after shows. And um, the, um, no, uh, you know, Brian Collins, outgoing, nice guy, I'm not brian. So why is this, why they I know. So then they come over and this is, I've never felt so bad about these two chicks are hot and I immediately go to, we're going to die, like they're trying to drag us and take some shit. And Then, uh, because I can't under offer any explanation for it and now they're congram and so we send them back shots and we don't go over there.

Speaker 2:          01:12:17       We just like, okay, it's even now. And then they come join us at a taBle and then the one girl starts talking to us. We were like, were you guys the show? And they're like, what? Show? And then I go onto we're chitchatting and the one girl goes, she goes, I really want to go to strip clubs right now. And I said, fuck, in this second trucking fantasy for me, it's, if I can go to strip clubs with these hot chicks and uh, and graham looks at me and I go, well, I could a flight to catch. And I guess I'll just see you guys later. Fucking walked awaY and that's never had this happened in vancouver. You walk around that cIty and I was just placed called the cactus club. And have you been there? No. Oh my god. What is it? They cast with head shots.

Speaker 2:          01:13:06       They uh, they staff their whole place with head shots. Real. It's the most gorgeous women you've ever seen in your entire life. working at a place. Cactus club. That cactus the cactus club. I don't know where they came back. So the uh, they uh, it's a lot of just hot chicks and that's when I saw in vancouver was just drinking hot chicks. I think prostitution is legal road. Do you think there are prostitutes? They might've been prostitutes. They got your drinks thinking they'll get these guys intoxicated. Look at him. He's got glasses on executive or something, some more money. He's got a little whore stash. Beacon ors. I just went to the beverly wilshire hotel. Where's that? I did a private gig. It's on right at the end of rodeo drive in Beverly hills. And then it's on wilshire and hits and it's an old hotel and Me and tom papa did a charity gig on monday night, so then me and tom hit the bar afterwards and proceed to watch parade

Speaker 7:          01:14:12       of high end or go through that place picking off old men left and right to the point where we're like, we were just shocked that he was really amazing. Good looking ladies. Well there's that. There's that crazy beverly hills money. You know, just the other day I was looking at real estate in beverly hills for a goof. You ever looked at like the redfin app though? I love that. I love to do that. every now and then. If I was going to move to beverly hills, let's see what I can afford. I'm looking at like $17,000,000 house to $85 million. A hundred million to $100 million. Duke, who's. That's exactly who's buying it. Well, I went to dinner with my wife and one of her friends, her friend's husband, and we went in beverly hills and this guy pulled up in a million dollar car. He had a bugatti Iran.

Speaker 7:          01:15:02       It's a million dollar car and it has saudi arabian license plates on plated, which is totally illegal. It's totally illegal to have Saudi Arabia license plates, like they're taking these cars. They either fly him over or they put them on a boat. They have them registered and Saudi Arabia, they bring them to America and they drive around with these plates on it. That palace plates, like it said like palace on the fucking plate and those guys warren taken carries because there's so much money. Yeah. You remember that one guy that was like some sort of a foreign dignitary guy and he was banging his maids or force them to suck his dick or something like that. And they called the cops on him and they aRrested him and then you know, they were going to process them and charge him with rape and he just fucking hopped in a private jet and flew out of the country and they were saying, why did you let this guy go?

Speaker 7:          01:15:50       Oh, fuck You. Fuck you. Diplomatic community. He was crying. Diplomatic immunity. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm juSt thinking about my mate is this old fucking mexican lady for sinners. The money it was arnold, but he did get the money in that area and beverly hills area is just, it's catastrophic. I mean it's stratospheric rather it's off the charts. like you can't even understand. like the guy who makes good money is poor there. Your I'm a poor person there. Yeah, I do well, but I'm poor. There sure is. When you get into oil money, people who own money and even in the United States, we do have people that have been here for so long and generate, you know trump's ma mayflower fucking shit where it's like, oh yeah, we own. We used to have my family used to own pasadena. That's another tricky thing is say we've talked about that is where there was so much money in pasedena that they put that to 10 freeway there. That's white is where it is. So they keep the black people on the other side. What's. That's exactly what every ways there where they keep the black people on which side? On the other side. Now north of pasadena, that to 10 separates out to dina. That's where the black people are. That's where the black people, that's why they call it crime medina.

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       Really? They called altadena crime medina. No way. Yeah, that's rough up there. Yeah. We were playing weird playing this youth basketball league when my son was maybe like a fifth grader and that got the nicest man in the world who ran a basketball league. Just got hit by a bullet in the head and fucking dead. Yeah, pasadena streets. There was this park. He got shot in pasedena. Just stray bullet. A stray bullet. Yeah. Who they shooting at each other? You know, gangs. Whoa. In pasadena, there's gang violence in pasadena. Shit load of it. What are the ice house? Not near the ice house. Ice houses on the right side. A south side. This is the freeway. Go fucking north of that freeway and go up into the hills right there and there's a shitload of crime. Shitload. Wow. I saw there's this place called villa park where my son was playing soccer and we went there and I saw guys getting their haircut in the street, like a stock guy sit down and just buzzing and lines of people just giving haircuts in the street and everybody watch out like this fucking rough neighborhood.

Speaker 2:          01:18:15       We're just dudes getting haircuts in the street and you're like, fucking everybody look alive. It's rough. It's a lot of latinos, you know. And there's also a lot of um, black on mexican crime member when that was happening in the nla, the mexican guys were just shooting black people, not black people really read any of them. Yep. Why trying to run them out of neighborhoods. Whoa. Yep. When you get into like ms 13 shit. Yeah. Convinced it starts to get. Well, that's where like Gary White people get really pro trump, you know, they're, they get very excited about trump and that's ms. [inaudible] is one of the things that they keep bringing it up and all these illegal immigrants that have these gangs for the most part. When you look at all of the people coming in to work, they don't want any trouble shore. Nobody. Everybody wants to keep their head down work these so I can give themselves a chance.

Speaker 2:          01:19:11       Road, trouble it with anything. There's going to be bad apples. There's going to be the guy in san francisco that everybody keeps referring to kind of be gangs, but you know what? I see that everYwhere I go, that is a huge fucking problem that is going to just spreading like wildfire is fucking math. Yeah. Math. Oh, thInk when you go an adderall, by the way. Adderalls ben. Oh, it's a huge problem and it leads people to meth. Really? Oh yeah, for sure. Adderall and meth are closely related. Very closely related. If they're both amphetamines. I took a half adderall once and I was like, oh, I'm never doing that again. Fuck yeah, I do. I'm not too good on drugs. It's a. I took. Freddy soto gave me an ambien who was an ambien, unfortunately to the men, wasn't it? It had to be sleep apnea. That yeah, he's fat and sIck,

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       you know, drugs and sleep apnea. Parents, a lethal combination because you don't feel yourself choking. Yeah, he gave me an ambien. I, we moved. I took it as like I needed to take a nap and that was all wound up. I slept for five hours straight in the middle of the day and I was like, I'm never fucking taken that again. And then, um, took this adderall and just felt all fucked up and just never. I'm like, I don't think my body don't know, just, uh, I don't do anything. I was getting really tired during the day and I remember you told me to take some vitamin d and so we started taking a multivitamin and that really helps me and I take a lot of b 12. That helps. And it would also help you in a big way, cut out all the bread and sugar and carbs and all that stuff because then the insulin spikes, you're not getting these big spikes, which is a big reason why people crash the other day.

Speaker 3:          01:21:05       It's bread, bread, pasta, all that stuff. Like your body goes too far and your body has to process that and you get this big slump is soon as you cut all that out. You experience a much, even much more even flow of energy through the day. Yeah. So if I could just learn to um, do like that. Like I'm like, I'm again, I'm such a glutton man. A bread when the kids were, my wife has making, gives you a fresh loaves of this artist and bread that she has. Then steve may bring peanut butter and jelly and it seems like I just like a scavenger. I'm a family goat. Like I'll just cross out all the kids leave behind. Sometimes it's stuff dealing with ordering food for myself at a restaurant because I know that everyone's going to leave half their shit or all order myself a full entree and then somebody will have half a chicken parmigiana or something over on it because my son and daughter and system ordering off the kid's menu.

Speaker 3:          01:22:05       And so now I got somebody eating a full chicken parmesan, but they'll only eat half of it and I'm not going to let that go to waste. And so I'll start digging into that and then there's pasta. They're like, let me just try one of those raviolis and then all of a sudden I eat like fucking three dinners. So I weigh more than i ever have weighed in my entire life right now. Wow. One 93, five, 10. Yeah. Wow. I think again, I go to the gym on a regular basis and I left and said like that. But yeah, I fucking 193 pounds. Yeah, it's the pasta and bread man. If you just cut all that stuff out, you'll drop a shitload of weight right away. I could be in the family goat. That'll help. That was one of the things when we were talking about that I think is kind of reporting like when you're talking about um, immigration and bad apples and stuff like that. I look at immigration that same way. I look at gun control, like most people that have guns are laW abiding citizens. And it's not going to be a problem. The vast, vast majority. And I think that's the same case with immigration and the same case with people coming to America, even illegally, they want to do Better.

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       That's why they're coming here. They're not coming here because they want to start crying and they, most of them are coming here because they want opportunities with guns. I totally agree. I want a shotgun so badly when I needed a double barrel. Like I want a shotgun and uM, I've shot a lot of guns should, especially with the daily show. I've done chuck jones for the daily shot. Got tori.

Speaker 5:          01:23:26       Yeah. I was going to be telling jokes, going to have to learn how to fucking clear room and defend yourself. Okay. All right. Now this is a thompson machine gun discipline. Very important for the dailies. Cheryl,

Speaker 2:          01:23:38       a 50 caliber sniper busters. 50 calibers are ridiculous. Dude, I will show you a video after this. Actually, maybe this hasn't really even aired because it was part of a pilot that I did that did. I did a pilot for comedy central when I left the daily show. It was an anti travel show called displaced. Sucks.

Speaker 5:          01:24:00       Didn't go through. I'll send it to you. Great idea. Just the con

Speaker 2:          01:24:04       dude. It's the fucking funny. You know what they said? Well, I mean, everybody said it was too mean. It's fucking hilarious. I go, we stayed in Kansas city. I go, hey everybody. My name's al madrigal. I'm in Kansas city. I'm going to tell you why this place sucks.

Speaker 5:          01:24:18       Just shit all over it and it to just do that online. Oh yeah. I should just put them out. Soy diet is a great idea for all things comedy. why don't you just like buy our main idea? I totally just, you own the idea, my idea. Oh my god, that's a great idea. so the idea, like as soon as you set it up, you know, someone says an idea in a light bulb goes off a real idea, and I do it in san francisco when I do it at san francisco is fucking filthy.

Speaker 2:          01:24:41       It is one of the dirtiest cities I've ever been in my entire life. And also it's like filled with rich douche bags now because of the internet. Boom. And then all this tech boom and the poor people are getting moved out. There's so much stuff to make fun of. So anyway, I'm paid fun of aI. went to this place, omb, guns and I shot machine guns, handguns, like a shot, everything. And then for the daily show I went and I drove a tank. I got to drive tanks. I was doing this chieftain tanks that I was driving. I got to run over to saturn's in a tank. Really fucking awesome. How do you drive a tank? Like What do you, what do you, you know? Yeah, it's levers and there's a. So um, yeah, you could watch and there was this hot chick that they had that was working there that was on it with me and at the same place I got to fire machine guns.

Speaker 2:          01:25:33       But I feel like when it comes to automatic weapons and a 50 caliber sniper buster and all that shit, I don't understand why you need to own that. I liked shooting it. I'll go shoot that stuff again. I really enjoyed it. And you can see me shoot that 50 caliber thing, like there was a shockwave, like your, your head flies, but you couldn't watch my arms and the skin on my arms ripple after I fucking. Because I wore a sleeveless shirt. Shoot It. Boom. Wow. And uh, I enjoyed it. I liked shooting that shit. I want the shotgun to defend my house when everything goes to hell. I'll be approximate zombie apocalypse and nice shotgun. I want just somebody to here get the fuck away from the door. You know, I have by my bed right now. Hammers, hammer. I have a hammer like bill makes it thinks it's the craziest thing.

Speaker 2:          01:26:31       Like you keep it by your bed. I keep a hammer under my bed. Like I'm going to fucking get up and close contact. Like hammering somebody with death. Yeah. It seems like you've thought it through, like really, really like on a surface level. I have a magnum flashlight and high flat magnum flashlight. Yeah. Peter, that always kIlls me. That people think they're going to club somebody with flashlight. No, no. I want to. I'm a flashlight in one hand. So lined him and then fucking run in and my hammer. why not a real weapon? I want a real one. I got knives. I have all closed. Contacted me. Never got a gun on my wife second. Oh, one of them. Yup. I'll get one. I'm working on her. She's good. She gets it. Yeah. We've got to do as a false flag in the house. Hire some friends of brick in. Oh yeah, that's a good idea.

Speaker 2:          01:27:21       Not false flag. The dick cheney of households. Oh zero. Um, yeah. I want the gun badly. But I feel like with an ak 47 and maybe people can write like only bad things have happened with people. You know a district is responsible gun owners. But you look at dylan roof and you look at columbine, you look at all these people getting shot up everywhere and seeing the hook. Like I don't want that to happen. I don't want my kids. I was walking away. I was safe. You put your guns in a safe. Why do you need an ak 47? Don't you don't need an ak 47. I'm saying to have all the handgun, but the thing is like, who should be able to decide who gets what. That's where it gets weird. yeah. And what about silencers to. Well, here's the thing in, in europe, silencers are thought of as a polite thing because we're over in America worried about shooting people.

Speaker 2:          01:28:16       They're worrying about noise. So like if you have a, what they call suppressor, that suppressor, like if you're hunting, you would hunt with a suppressor on because you don't want to blow your fucking ears. Man. I'll put the links out to these two pieces that I did a daily show spots. I'll do the one. If you go to my thing that twitter, uh, I'll, uh, I'll put it on. I'll send them to you. That when I drove a tank and fired all those guns. And then I did a silencer piece as well. And the guy was saying he wanted to protect kids ears with the silencers. And that's what Donald Trump is saying. Kids. And I'm worried. the reality is though, and this is true, I know a lot of friends that are hunters that shot guns as kids and they're fucked up now. They're ears are a mess. They the. They should,

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       but they didn't when they were younger because they didn't know any better. See, 20 years ago people didn't know that you were going to do permanent damage to your ears. They didn't. You didn't need. Never heard about it. Like these people just shotguns, but I think also the uNfortunate reality now is that you Could have somebody walking around undetected shooting, shooting people in a college and you could call it why I did, I was on kcrw and walking around the Santa monica campus and I really did think I'm like, okay, who's the shooter Coast water? And then it shouldn't be a thought that. No, it shouldn't. Yeah. I mean it's a mental health issue when he was like the only person that's capable of doing that as a person who's sick. Yeah. You know, and that's the other thing that doesn't come up when you're talking about mass shootings is whenever you hear about it, the news, nobody makes the correlation, the inescapable correlation between psychoactive drugs and mass shootings because there's a lot of fucking mass shooters, like almost all of them that are either on pharmaceutical drugs like ssri disassociative drugs or they're getting off of um, anti psychotic drugs.

Speaker 3:          01:30:11       There's what can be done is you're like, there is no common ground. We started having people make. We live in this country where you should be able to do whatever you want and hAve whatever you want. But then who gets to decide who gets crushed in what guns? Well, Texas has sort of taken the idea that just everyBody has a gun, a well armed society is a polite society. Well, my ron white all of a sudden, and then teachers should have guns in the classroom. And bulletproof helmets, full vests. Jesus, ak, 47 is right there, right there. Put down the truck. I don't know man. It sucks yet. Think about it. There's no easy solution. Yeah, well it just, every time. one of those things happens, everybody buckles down and wants to take away guns and try to figure out legislation and I just feel like the root of the problem is not the tools that people are using.

Speaker 3:          01:31:04       It's the fact that someone's willing to use those tools, the fact that someone is willing to do that, the fact that those guns are more accessible is a genuine issue. But I think we can all agree that no one came for the guns. Uh, obama, every single obama's coming for the guns will. Do you know why he knows deanna, right? Because the nra is too strong. The lobbies too strong, they, they've spent a shitload of money and continue to spend a shitload of money to make sure they protect the second amendment rights. So you're saying if they will, if not for the nra, dash a hundred percent have taken all the guns, they would have definitely done something similar to what Australia did. Australia essentially made gun ownership very, very, very difficult. They took away guns. They, they enact a very strict laws and they had like one mass shooting at a long time ago.

Speaker 3:          01:31:50       Had a big mass shooting a long time ago. That's the thing. That's the only habit is like these big mass shootings, you know, when you see. But Australia has the same amount of people's California and it's the size of the United States. Yeah. They just, I just saw the thing. There was a map comparisons until your mind is like, it's the exact same says yeah, it's crazy and people are spread way spread out and it's the same amount of people's los angeles and it's in this giant ass fucking country. So when you think about being able to take people's guns in Australia, it's different. The culture is different. The, the idea of independence is different over there. we have a different attitude over here. yeah. I just don't want to. um, yeah. When you have little kids again. Yeah. Your changes, you know, or just like, I don't want ever.

Speaker 3:          01:32:35       Why worry about them growing up in a society where a teacher does have to think about wearing a fucking helmet. Of course, of course. I mean nobody wants to think that. I don't know what the solution is, but the solution. Look, getting the guns away from the people. There's more guns than there are human beings in America and they're not. They're not going to stop making guns. No good business guns of the problem. I really don't. I mean, I support gun ownership. I really do. I don't think that's the issue. I think the issue is that we saw in France and nice that some crazy fucking take a car and kill 100 people by plowing over pizza and just started stabbing people to get out of the car and just fucking start stabbing folks. There's, there's ways that people lose their fucking minds and do horrible things to people and the ways are not things you have to take away.

Speaker 3:          01:33:24       You have to figure out a way and not take away all hammers. No, I don't know what the solution is, but I don't think anybody does. But I think what you're getting at with the mental health stuff is there. I'm not opposed to there being a screening process and seeing if you have a history of violence. Of course. Yeah. And, uh, if you are show up on a terrorist watch list and that's where I think the nra goes overboard, like if you're on a fucking terrorist watch list, who doesn't agree with that? Well, the only problem with thAt is who gets to decide who's on the terrorist watch list because there was people that were um, from uh, the green party that were put on terrorist watch list after nine slash 11 because they were anti war protesters and they were put on no fly list.

Speaker 3:          01:34:06       There was a lot of weird shit that happened where people were put on lists because they pissed off the wrong people. And you know, in 2001 it was way easier to do something like that, but it is to go to buy a gun and then they say, I'm sure he can purchase his weapon because you're on that list. And then you go to a gun show that's part of the problem. You go to a gun show and you can buy a gun far easier in Kansas city trying to tighten that down though. Kansas, Kansas, you can go and correct me If I'm wrong, it didn't choke up. This place sucks. What am I still go to Kansas and then you can get a gun with. No, you don't. You can just an id Kansas id and get it in maybe like five minutes. Zero traIn. It's nothing.

Speaker 3:          01:34:51       Just you get it right away. You don't have to have a background check. Nothing. So is that true? Yes. Was that like when you did in 2014? I did this Piece yet. But you can look at it. Can we, can we check the gun laws? Kansas? No background check. No background check. I'm pretty certain. So why wouldn't you have to disclose in Kansas? Listening to this guy he does with his grandma, he walks into this place and he goes, uh, I can't. The guy says I caN't buy the gun, but she can like that he buys these four guns or something. Kills a bunch of people. So federal law requires federallY licensed firearms dealers but not private sellers to initiate a background check on the purchase purchaser prior to sale a firearm. As a result, concealed weapons license holders in Kansas are exempt from the federal background check requirement.

Speaker 3:          01:35:41       Yeah, that's crazy. No training, no background check hold on. A second. Concealed weapons license holders like you have to have a concealed weapons license, which is difficult to acquire and it's not easy to get a concealed weapons license unless they have a different law, theIr background checks and cans, concealed weapon, but I think concealed weapons is like the hardest thing to get is a concealed carry. Federal law provides states with the options of serving as state. Kansas has no law requiring firearms dealers to initiate background checks prior to transferring a firearm. As a result in Kansas, firearms dealers must initiate the backgrouNd check required by federal law, bY contacting the fbi directly. Kansas is not a point of contact state, huh? So they have to contact the fbi. A federal law does not require dealers to conduct a background check of a firearm. Purchaser presents a state permit to purchase or possess firearms.

Speaker 3:          01:36:35       It meets certain conditions. So it seems like tHere's definitely some wiggle room. Yeah, yeah, for sure. And then you know, that's an area is talking about these gun shows where you can just go gobble up a bunch of firearms and that he can bring them into. That's what they just transport them across state lines and it's one of those things like many human issues where there's not a whole lot of like clear paths. It's like there's so many guns. You're never going to take them all away from people. And should you take them all away from him? Like if a guy like you as a gun, I don't feel like danger a threat unless you get in one of your god damn tirade. He might maybe have another best example

Speaker 5:          01:37:11       that hack fucking stealing. So

Speaker 3:          01:37:19       did you hear that? Bit like a. Not a bid. The video. Carlos min sia was on joey diaz a show saying that he thought about bringing a gun around, going to the comedy store and shooting people and he was carrying a gun in his car. Like, no way, I'm crazy while there maybe you shouldn't have a gun. That'S where I started thinking about Ohio, which brings me back and then started thinking about, you know, I look at redfin, trulia. I would go to, oh, I'm living out there and you live in Ohio was weird. Checking out. I was in Ohio recently. It's weird. Really? Yeah. Everybody talks about how great it is. I think the resort is great. Oh yeah. We did an airbnb out there in Ohio

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       was like, eh, that's true. Not feeling would have been nice restaurants. What about when you get out to like cdot? Oh, that's fucking beautiful. That's like one percent or that's like $12,000,000 house territory. That's really a saudi arabian. Sheik has a beautiful rich people found a good spot. Yeah, they really did have. I liked that. Santa barbara. I liked it. See any as I like to go up the coast to verbally looks this. You want to go look at deck kane? Bria, where's that? That's in the middle of California. It's Just a coastal town. There's a place called avalon beach. It's all. It gets into like san louis obispo county, a random middle of people haven't. It's a little bit too far to drive. It'll take like three and a half hours at la. Little town. Walked to the coffee place with the dogs. My buddy john hackleman lives in san luis obispo, who's a chocolate.

Speaker 2:          01:38:49       So I'm a karate training. I would say accounts probably with a chocolate down. Did you really didn't know him or anything? I just knew that fuckIng guy. What is this? Tambria is pretty. Yeah, just the one. Oh, yep. Yeah, that's pretty. It looks quiet. But uh, san luis obispo for fucking great. There's no one there. It's just the college and it's real quiet. morro bay is also another big rock and then you can just go fish. You can do a bunch of shit like that. So that's again, I'm, I am so high strung and I do feel like I'm prone to like I can't be walking around telling dads at my school to fuck off and do that. I told one guy to go find go, you're a fucking asshole. You know what happened? You're just re. He's a fucking dick to my son. The dad was, dad was, he was a basketball coach and I saw him.

Speaker 2:          01:39:45       I go, hey, real asshole, you know that. Well, and uh, because no dad's talked to each other like that, and I call this guy an asshole and I felt bad. I can feel fucking band. I don't want to do it, but I did it. And he's a dick and everybody knows he's a fucking dick in your coach. Hey, coach at a school. Yeah. Is it still there or is it done and he's done. He's done. Yeah. well, it's a lot of people that can't let the stress of being a comic. Right. It's one kras trust. Imagine the stress of dealing with hormonally active seventeen-year-old every fucking year. New ones coming in. Just chaos younger team now. Not even that. Just being an asshole to an 11 year old. Oh, well, he's a piece of shit. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Well there's a lot of fucking stress and raIsing people and teaching kids and dealing with the problems that kids present. You know, a lot of people that just. Here's another thing that's going on today. People think that they can have a kid and then have careers too, and everyone's having a career at the mom has a career that data as a career, but he has a career and when you're watching the kid who's paying attention to the kid. I went to a party and I've talked

Speaker 7:          01:40:54       about this in the podcast before. This one little kid was just running around hitting everybody and do it. The parents are inside drinking there in the party drinking and the kids out there with the other kids and then finally the guy comes down to apologize. I'm sorry. He's a good kid. He's not a good kid. like he's hit three kids. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I told them when he, what the kid did, he goes, he never did that. I go, I saw him do that. Watch your son being and the guys, like I said, I'm sorry. I'm like, oh my god, I want to kill you. Do you understand? I want to grab your neck and choke the life out of you. I'm containing mySelf. You fucking cunt. Yes. So I get into putting those seeds. Yeah, but I keep it cool. I keep it called magic.

Speaker 7:          01:41:27       How do you do it? I don't know if i. Because I practice murder on a daily basis. oh my god. I just murdered a punching bag or run up hills. I get it out of my system. Birch just told me this story about you exercising sets come a un tate and that guy with his shirt off that was trying to get into your hotel room. Oh yeah. And I would've fucking. I don't know what I would've done if I'm not going to, you know, that's the other thIng. It's like I would just put it, that guy wound up being unconscious tape, put them to sleep to choke them unconscious. But it was nice to him. He could have taken his life. That guy was a real piece of shit. He was a big giant dude. He was like six foot six and he was a bully and he thought because he was so tall, he thought that people were scared of him, but you know he fucked with the wrong guy in tate.

Speaker 7:          01:42:20       First of all, a guy who's been arrested, been around bad people his whole life, been in numerous treat. fights was a professIonal fighter, was on the ultimate fighter, was a black belt In jujitsu, mean everything was wrong and tate was trying to be calm with the guy and the way tate handled it like he it. They fought in a hotel lobby right in front of the elevator and the guy was pounded on his door saying, you're in my fucking room. I think I was just a cunt. And a tape was like, no, look, my key works here. It's definitely my room. And he shuts the door and he was, hey, fucking faggot. you think you can get away with shutting this fucking door? Who was open this fucking door? Told you in my room and then we all went outside. It was me and eddie, bravo and tate.

Speaker 7:          01:43:03       We're looking at this guy and we're lookIng at his friend and we're trying to figure out how we're going to do this like this. This has to be dealt with. Like, this is not a guy that's going to go away. He was a big drunk dumb guy and tate decides the way to handle it is, um, you know, there's a bunch of words being exchanged. So tate decides he, uh, he kicks the guy in a legs in the leg and then he grabs them and pulls him on top of him. So the guy like literally has no idea, like why? So he kicks his leg, grabs them and pulls them on top of them and pulls them into what's called the guard, you know, like in jujitsu and then wraps them up and something called an omoplata, which is a shoulder lock. So he throws, I mean, this is all instantaneous kick pole throws his shoulder over them.

Speaker 7:          01:43:50       Then the security guard show up, the security guard show up and they go, hey, hey, hey, what the fuck is going on? And I go, relax. I go, everything's gonna. Be fine. He's just going to choke him to sleep and they got the security guard goes. Joe rogan, joe rogan. Holy shit, man. What are you doing here while I said this, like he's just gonna choke him asleep. Take goes. All right. I guess I'm going to choke them asleep now. I mean this is all happening. Within seconds. Tate sinks in a rear naked choke on this guy and just squeezes them unconscious, gets off of them. Doesn't hurt the guy at all. It doesn't hit him all. He does kick his leg out from under him. Take them down, choke them unconscious. The guy, his friend picks his friend up. I and I go get your fucking friend and get sober him up and get him out of here.

Speaker 7:          01:44:34       And he's lucky. Nothing happened and he's like, sorry man, my friends, piece of shit. I'm sorry. his friend picks his friend up. the guys like delirious. They push them in an elevator elevator door closes. He disappears from life. Never seen him again. That's it. The end of it. I'd take pictures with the fucking security guards there smiling like it was fine. It goes a drunk asshole. Just think we should call the cops. I go, no, I go, that guy's humiliated. Like unless he comes back, he comes back, he's going to get fucked up, but right now everything's fine. Don't call the cops. So they laughing and everyone's laughing. We took a couple pictures together, went back in the room, went and got some dinner and we were laughing.

Speaker 2:          01:45:10       Yeah. But when that dad is in your face at the party, that exercise that come, uh, is, is, that's again, that's the thing that I struggled with when mike costa is onstage and I'm being completely honest. Like again, this is how I feel and it's just somebody that takes over and I'm like, I can't help but say, hey, your son is hitting that guy. Like, this is not cool. This is not okay. Parents don't want their kids and their kids are just compLete asshole. Well, they go to parties and they drink and they leave the kIds outside and this parents, these particular parents, they don't watch the kid ever. They. This is like what they're famous for apparently in their group that just don't watch this kid. They just, they don't want to be parents. They became parents in their forties. They didn't

Speaker 7:          01:45:56       really planned it out that I don't know if the parents get along. I dunno. I dunno how we put the whole thing looks like a disaster and the kids a little monster and they just are not. They're not disciplining him, paying attention and like he literally went out and talked to the kid and there was some commotion going on. Were people complaining about the kid hitting somebody? He talked to the kid and then he high fived him and then the kid went back to doing it again. I mean literally he went back inside to drink. The kid went back outside again. So at the end of the night when this guy apologized to me like it, if the kid was doing it all, now I go, hey man, your kid is really aggressive. And he's like, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about the kid I go, your kid is really aggressive with no, he's a good kid. I go, don't look. He hit, he hit three people. I saw him hit people, I saw them push a kid and call him a loser. I go, he's fucking six and he's doing this. He goes, that never happened.

Speaker 7:          01:46:45       You know, I had to understand consequences. This is why I bite my tongue. I understand like the, the actual consequences of, of smacking this guy and his fucking mouth, which is what I wanted to do, you know? Of course, if there was no consequences to doing anything and I didn't think of him as a person. I didn't think of him as a guy who just never raised the kid before, hasn't really thought about it. Well, has a big career, probably busy all the time. Wife's busy all the time. Just not doing a good job raising a little monster, you know, drinking to try to drown out the facts. Who knows why, you know, drinking because he doesn't like being married, drinking because he doesn't like being a dad. Drinking because he doesn't like being sober. Who knows? I don't know. I don't know the guy, but in that moment when he's looking at me and going, that never happened. I just did just to the fucking sheer ignorance and incompetence and irresponsibility was just so infuriating because I've watched my kids, like I've watched them, I talk to them, I communicate with them. I know I didn't have a good childhood, so for me it's important to be a good dad and spend as much time as I can. Communicate, explaining shit, talk to them, treating them like I'm not just their dad, but also I'm their friend and I care about them.

Speaker 2:          01:47:53       My wife is a first grade teacher and she's become a educational therapists right now, so I'm like living with just the master at consequences. Like if you don't eat in our house or decide you don't like broccoli, nothing else is coming. Good kitchen is closed and that's when people create monsters. When they cater to them so much. That's okay. Let me in and that's where you like your kid only eats fucking rice. I have a friend who and he keeps feeding this fucking kid sugar. This kid just eats nothing but sugar all day because he doesn't need. He doesn't eat. I go, what do you mean he doesn't eat? He's always eating cookies because he won't eat his food.

Speaker 7:          01:48:30       I got to feed him something. I go, no, dude, you got to tell them you can't eat the cookies. You've got food. You've got actual food. This fucking kid is just eating nothing but candy. I mean it's. It's bananas. He's always got a soda in his hand. Oh

Speaker 2:          01:48:43       good. He's six. He's fucking six and he's drinking a full coke or you go over the house. The kid has a root beer. We sell these kids. We were on a flight and a saudis to parents sit in first class and then come back and check. We didn't know what was going on and coach. They put three next to each other and coach some motherfuckers I know. Crazy. Right? And then everybody else has to do with their kid. They gave each of them my pants. Right. And then they waitress, the waitress or the stewardess comes by and she looks at these three kids and looks around for who they're with and the one that will have the kids. I'm telling eight is the oldest one, a maybe six and four. Three just in a row. Jesus christ, the oldest one goes three sprites, sprites. This is a red eye, is an overnight flight.

Speaker 2:          01:49:38       They're on ipads, like just animals just don't stop trying to win something. And then, um, my wife were sort of laughing at first, but everybody in our family wants to go to sleep. They already exhausted from being out all day. I've never is a while ago. I'll never be on this flight again. No red eyes for me. This horrible, horrible, ruined for days, two days afterwards. You're fucked. Yeah. Tried to do anything in your power to avoid a read. I also try to do everything in your power to avoid. I'm looking at if you can fly nonstop, that's 100 percent. Yep. So they get in a fight after a while, start fighting because they're all hopped up on sugar and they were staring at the screen and fucking so then they started fighting and I think the mom or the dad hears or somebody has to tap them to get up and me and my wife was like, this is not okay.

Speaker 2:          01:50:39       Nothing was said because again, we just want to monitor on business. Ideally, again, ideally everyone minds their own business. This is a new world though. This world of electronic babysitters and the world of putting the kids and coach and you go into first class, like ignoring kids and it's these career people. There's a lot of people that look, they their career requires all their time. They justified by go look, someone's gotta make the money in this household so we can keep up this lifestyle. And so they're out there fucking grinding all day and then the kids are just, what do I do? It be me full circle to my dad passing away. He's at every single weekend and this is why I bought that fj 62 lane cruiser because every single weekend we went on a little family trip and I looked at myself and we'd go on family vacations and stuff, but the amount of time that my family really spent together like a mom and a dad, like he would take us to yosemite.

Speaker 2:          01:51:35       He would take us up the coast of mendocino, we'd go to marin or stinson beach and all these places, even in golden gate park. Like he would just take us places, little adventures, you know. And so I feel like we need to, I get caught up in work working because it just nonstop and I got to take a step back and really spend as much time as I possibly can. So after that happened, and this is june, so almost a year ago, just really tried trim back. I go to every single volleyball game. I go to every practice I possibly can, you know, and just force yourself to say this is not, it doesn't matter that much because you look at all these deathbed. That's what I started looking at all these deathbed regrets. Those are a bunch of lists that are out there. Jesus, too much time spent at work.

Speaker 2:          01:52:26       yeah. not enough time spent with people that I love, you know, and look at all these things and it's like, fuck it, I'm not having any of these regrets. So that's What I'm thinking. I started looking at the real estate and trying to look at getting away, you know, just really check it out. And that's what I'm trying to hustle and make as much money as I and kids who are in a house. Where are you going to go? That's what I'm checking into. That's what I know a lot about cambridge. That's a big sur or one of those places I could go up there and you're, you're away and just live on the coast and then be able to come back. Like if I get an acting gig, I love acting. I like, I really enjoy it. I love writing too. I was luckily had some success recently as a comedy writer and um, it's one of the cbs people I was trying to match up with the latino show runner and two years ago they go, no, no, that's, that's you, you're going to be that guy.

Speaker 2:          01:53:23       There aren't really any, but we're grooming you to be that. And I wrote too big scripts and then that business background, I have the ability to do that. I like, I like working with people and I think I could staff up and do all that shit so I could see myself splitting my time, keeping my little house in la and then having a place in cambria or santa barbara and just fucking go back and forth. Santa barbara is easy. It's only an hour, hour and 10 just living on the beach and have a blue heeler be able to sit back and watch the ocean. Just calm yourself, calm yourself, you know. And that's what, again, fucking ari shaffir said that when he was walking on a beach and he needed to walk to a restaurant, 40 minutes, that he had this feeling in his head that oh, I need to be doing something right now and that he needed to curb that and he needed to just watch the waves.

Speaker 2:          01:54:21       Yeah. That was it. Not think about. And that's what I have is the problem I have is I have a. When you try to meditate, people have said there's a river of 20,000 thoughts that you get just nonstop. And I've been waking up every single night at 2:00 in the morning every night, almost. Not every night, but four or five nights a week. Why different reasons to think about thoughts just and then just thinking about stuff nonstop. Well, let's just see what you're saying to me. Two different contradictory things. You're saying that you want peace and you want calm and then you're saying you want to start running shows and then you're saying you want to start having multiple careers. I want to be able to work on coming into town. Do a gig, right? You caN't be a show runner. Work on a thing for like you sAid, the show that I'm on is 10 episodes and we worked on that for five months and then I wanted to do nothing else.

Speaker 2:          01:55:23       Right. But you know that when you work on a show, you're working 16 hour days. Like if you want to be a show runner for a successful show that the amount of time that's required to actually make something take off sure was massive. We you have to manage a bunch of different people and expectations and. but it's a. It's a portion of your year, so it'd be like working seasonal work almost secret. You just. That's It for me. That's the ideal version. Has to act on a show that has a episode order and then go back to santa barbara and then do nothing, saw a bad idea and then come back and be able to just control your own work is really what I want to do. You need to financial freedom to be able to do that and then those shows pay really well. So I'm just trying to map out and I don't have the answer. I'm thinking, and this is certainly not something I'm doing right now, but again, when you work seasonally and then you can really take some time to just hang out and read on a deck and make dinner and that's your go shop for an individual meal every day. Go and fish and do shit like that.

Speaker 7:          01:56:32       yeah. You seem like you're longing for this. I'm idealistic view of peace and quiet while pursuing chaos. Yeah, they're very contradictory. You understand what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          01:56:44       Totally will. ThiS is something that I promised myself I was going to bust my ass until I was 50 and I'm 48. I'm about to turn 46 and then just take it as it comes when realistically as she just take it as it comes right now and not now. I hustle really hard. You know? I have 10 things going on.

Speaker 7:          01:57:06       Yeah. It's a weird balancing act trying to figure out, figure out how to manage your life for ultimate happiness and then sometimes like that the real ultimate happiness comes after you've had struggle. Like you only really appreciate sunlight if you get a lot of rain, like we don't have. Like I went to prince of wales island in Alaska for six days once and we were up there camping. It's fuckiNg miserable pouring rain every day. But when I came back to la, God damn, I was happy. The sunlight felt so good. I mean it felt like the sunlight's out there right now. It doesn't feel like shit. I get mY car, god, it's hot. I drive off. I don't appreciate it, but when I came back from Alaska I really fucking appreciate it and I feel like some amount of the peace and quiet that we seek and we enjoy. You're only gonna. Appreciate it. If you struggle like you're only going to appreciate like real relaxation feet up out the beach if you've been busting your ass.

Speaker 2:          01:58:02       For me, What I think a tremendous amount of calm comes from is, and this is, I don't know, you can tell me is just financial freedom. like I don't have a house payment hanging over my head and I don't have all this stuff that I'm just worried about and I, I tend to worry a lot about that stuff. That's why I worked my ass off. Like I really want to just. And I'm over complicating my life, but I am and, and david really big. You see me? I'm Like, I'm a happy guy, but I just, when we waken up in the middle of the night at 2:00 in the morning thinking about all the shit that you have to do, you had to pare some stuff. Yeah, there's that for sure. When you're a financially free,

Speaker 7:          01:58:45       it removes a gigantic burden. I remember my first development deal. That was the first thing I felt. I got a development deal way back in the nineties and the first thing that happened, they sent me thIs big fat check and all of a sudden I felt lighter. Like, like something. Like I took a backpack off, filled with rocks. Like ugh. Now I knew that I could paY my bills for the foreseeable future. I was going to be able to pay my bills for the next, like more than a year if I wanted to do nothing, sit back for a year and live the way I'm living, I'd have no problem paying my bills. And uh, it was a very tangible feeling like, okay, now that I have this momentum, I've got to keep this going because I don't ever want to go back to that feeling of not being able to pay my bills because that's the real struggle. The real struggle is like financial independence. Once You become financially independent, then there's levels to it, you know, like you want to have one of those monosito houses or have a fucking private jet or you want to get crazier and crazier and crazier. You're just so overly confident.

Speaker 2:          01:59:43       That's like the assistant thing. Exactly. That's kind of. So I feel like this level right here. So I'm living in the house that I want to live in. I'm not, I'm never moving and we're good to, in terms of the la sort of raising my kids house like a, we're in a great little place. I love it. I live in pasadena second. There's the wildlife in your yard. You send me pictures of deer in your yard. Exactly. There's deer, coyotes, bobcats jumped out behind me the other day. Jesus. Yeah. It was running as bears and in the past dean happened to people's pools only in the black neighborhooD. So yes. Black bears too weird. It totally. And so what they. I'm, I'm, I'm cool. I don't want, I don't need to fly private. I don't need to. I'm sure that's nice. I have no aspirations.

Speaker 2:          02:00:36       I again, I just want to live comfortably, but once you fly in first class, it's difficult to go sit by the bathroom in between two other people like, you know, so there's certain luxuries that I want to be able to afford. But again, I just want to chill out, hang out in the backyard and have a drink with my wife and fucking have people over and barbecue. That's it. That's all after you totally do that. That's, that's very peaceful and that's a great tHing. And then also getting satisfaction out of creating stuff and making stuff and working at the same time. And even if it's shit that I'm this guy that I bought this house from the left knee as table saw and all a bunch of wood furniture. What are you doing? Are you making furniture? I'm not doing anything with it. Are you thinking about doing something like thinking about like, I got, use this stuff. We know how to use a table. Saw. No, we'll learn. Don't cut your fucking face. Never know.

Speaker 7:          02:01:34       Sure.

Speaker 2:          02:01:36       Now I'm gonna make. Um,

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       he left like a, some birdhouse stuff there. I've just wanted to be the old man that like tinkers and makes shelves and stuff like that for people. And uh, my, my, my dad was an artist and my uncle john is an artist and um, you know, put together the sculptures with all wood and he was like a very skilled carpenter. So I always like looked at those guys thinking I gotta do this shit. Then I just want to like, yeah, there's a bunch of shit I like to do like that. Like I want to tinker, I want to fly fish. Fly fishing is fun. See, I used to fly fish a lot. There's a casting thing in the arroyo in pasadena where there's a big arroyo casting club. Was all these old men just practicing. Where do they fly fishing. Pasadena's needs. Is there a river there now?

Speaker 3:          02:02:25       There's a whole place where it's like they've, it's just a body of water where they made me like a little pond. Yeah. so then they go out, they take trips to places that I'll go out and go to, go to sierra and I was in bozeman this center this summer, bozeman, Montana. And we, uh, we went by this, a place where all these people were fly fishing and then maybe so excited. I'm like, god, I want to go back and do that. But it was weird because they catch and release and I was like, okay, now you're weirding me out because you're just putting a hole in that fish's face. Then you'll let them back. Like this is kind of fucked up. My buddy, a daily show guy just went to Russia to go fly fishing. He's super into it and they bought a place in upstate New York that has a river right by it.

Speaker 3:          02:03:08       And just time, that's because up for, well, if you can do like a place where you can catch the fish and eat it. God damn on the shore if you have a little cast iron frying pan, make little campfire and have some shore lunch. Oh so delicious for me. That is the sort of ultimate hanGing out with my wife having a glass of wine, doing that. reading and then going to bed. But yOu really want to do it or do you like the romantic idea of doing it? We're going to fucking find out. But right now it's just the romantic ideal. Totally. Yeah. But I do like going, we've gone away in a couple of times, like um, my kids are just at the point where they went away for a sleepover and this only happened one time and me and my wife drove up into altadena and heard about this hike that people do and took the dogs, went on this hike and we had a blast.

Speaker 3:          02:03:57       And I know that if I could mix it in a proper amount of work and the proper amount of just chilling out, I'll love it. I have three hammocks in my backyarD that I don't use. I barely lanD them. Yeah. See, this is what I'm getting out of you. I'm getting that you're, you're thinking about like this romantic idea of relaxation and peace and quiet, but look at our constantly vacation homes non, but meanwhile you're also planning on doing a bunch of shows and being an executive producer and a show runner and a writer and a standup performer and you're actinG and. Yeah, I've got a ton of shit going on and you're yelling at people yelling necessarily talking about eventually getting

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       to a cognitive therapist and potentially starting meditation. It's like you have this. I just do it noW. Yeah, well, yeah, for sure. Yeah. You should have already done it like you, you, you, all these things you should should've already done. So this is the problem with me. He's money. Okay. So the atc I don't do for anyone. I have nothing but money in. So that's not about money at all. So that's starting like I started my standup career eventually. That'll be great. No. Well, it takes a lot of work, but that's just what is the idea behind it? Okay. So we things comedy by the way. So this is all things comedy is me and bill came up with the idea that comedians should own and distribute all of their own content. When I first showed up in la, worked on tv. So cheech from cheech and chong who told me to do two things, it would be nice to every single person you meet out in the public, uh, every busboy is going to have the teacher's an asshole story if you're addicted.

Speaker 2:          02:05:34       Anybody. So try to be as nice to as many people as you can. And then he goes, also, you want to own every single piece of content you ever put out there because. And he goes, I owned all the movies and I owned all the albums. So every single day is all this mailbox money and now we get put as comedians, restarting I everybody starting all these podcasts and this is 2010. So we do all the paperwork, we finally get the company and we take a big chunk of the company. And we say, okay, everyone that participates in this network, this is the board of directors, thompson, agora, bert, kreischer, ari shaffir, dave anthony, myself, bill burr, and we help guide this place in the right direction. So when new comic wants to come on, all of us sort of go, do we want this person on?

Speaker 2:          02:06:25       For example, john repin and tiana are going to start a podcast. I approached John Reed called me and I talked to sarah and put them together. Felipe esparza, uh, saw that no latinos are doing podcasts. I know philippe's fucking hilarious. And instead of like being all like to the other latino comedians, all competitive, it's like fleabag, you got to do fucking podcast. And he started one called what's up? Fool does great, and it's helped out as numbers and everything like that. So we all collectively owned this company together that distributes our content. So in this content starts with podcasts would then eventually we started our own studio. We are redoing our website right now. We're going to start selling our own tv shows. Burt did a cooking show called something's burning. Why? It's fucking a tom. And bill watching to most unsanitary

Speaker 3:          02:07:17       ever seen him play with his nose touching is no, quit fucking touch your nose one more time. I'm not going to eat any of that shit. No one's going to eat that shit. And they're fucking yelling at each other while they're cooking and bert and just dumped a bunch of oil down the sing can. Yeah. You were making that and we shot for an hour and tom and bill were hunched over laughing. I was in the back just cracking up because he couldn't believe what I was watching. But what are you doing with it? That should be a show. Is it on anything right now? So it's going to be on abc.com or we're going to sell it as an individual. You did it a long time ago? No, we just shot. It was distance three. Couple of months ago. Weeks ago? yeah. Two weeks ago. Three weeks. Not two weeks. Three, four weeks ago.

Speaker 3:          02:08:04       And just haven't edited it or editing it right now. They're just putting it together. So do you have like a, a group of editors and stuff? So we partner with this company called soapbox films that has 15 editors, animators, all these people on staff. So when you come by you'll see that we have two full stages. We have a green screen, white cyc, if color corrections, you know, a sound mixing studios. And then they gave us our podcast studio to different offices and then other meeting rooms as part of like an investment in us. Wow. So anyway, but everybody owns everything. We have atc records that again, I haven't had the time. We're just staffing up right now because we took on a little bit of money. But you took on money. You know, we've got an investor's. Yeah, we got investors. Did somebody get out and given us a million bucks?

Speaker 3:          02:08:55       Jesus. yeah. So the idea behind it is you're kind of acting as a network. We're going to turn into our own network. It's going to be like united artists and when shows sell, it's going to be full transparency. When let's say something's burning goes up and people start buying it. Burt just gonna look at his back end and know exactly. You know, the money has to be recouped and then you know, the money is split. Interesting. He'll just get access. Like burt will own that if there's, if there's a tv show that gets made out of that and it becomes popular and then there's the idea behind it that there's strength in numbers and yeah, we all, we all really help each other out too. Like if I'm, for example, I got this special coming out and everyone's going to help me get behind it.

Speaker 3:          02:09:42       When burt special comes out, everybody says, you know, goes crazy. We sort of do that. Anyway. We all do that. Anyway, that's the collection. This is like, um, this is an association of comics working together to promote each other. And so like if you guys have a podcast on the all things comedy label, everyone knows, well this is going to be pretty high quality because comedians are going to be a better show. We're going to reign that in a little bit like you said, but for the most part we have a lot of people contacting us and it's all community of our peers. We all really like and really enjoying that or is that bringing you extra stress? It brings you a little extra stress because they've put some money in. It's definitely something I'm looking at. I'm getting to a point and empowering other people that have some other comics coming into help me work on creative stuff. But is it making money

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       or is it. Oh yeah. So we just um, you know, we haven't put out any of our tv shows yet. I mean I hope to have tv shows on the air. Let's just like funny or die makes money off of unbranded. I got to have companies come to us and want scripts written and I was able to give gigs to guys I knew on a daily show where they get paid like $45,000 to write a script for a corporation. Oh wow. And all those times you get gigs, like we can serve as the agency for that. We can do, I can match tom papa up with a company so he can write their ad copy just to bring him extra side money. Like we can do branded content integrated marketing. And all that shit. And have the comedians on the company that does that. Comedians are responsible for so much fucking content. It's books, it's tv shows, it's movies. It's just like you're thinking about all these comics are producing so much great shit. Then why shouldn't all the comics have a company that distributes on it?

Speaker 7:          02:11:36       Well, it's interesting because there's a bunch of groups that are coming along right now that are trying to capitalize on podcasting. And one of the things that's fascinating. I had a conversation with a friend of ours who's got a podcast and his agency or his management company that suck now are telling him they want a piece of the podcast, fuck you. And for the longest time they were telling him he was wasting his time doing a podcast and they were saying you need to worry about like put, getting a scripted show getting of this and a dad. And he was like, I really think that there's something in podcasts. So they. They were negative and they were criticizing his efforts and now they want a piece of it and he's baffled and he doesn't know what to do. I'm like, you got to leAve them. no, you gotta leave them. Absolutely not. They're not doing anything. Before I even talk to me. I could have just a thursday. No

Speaker 2:          02:12:24       sense in you. You're doing it. It's like this is something just like your standup career than you really don't. Now because of the technology, you don't need an intro to the establishment. When you're a young standup comedian, you need a management manager and an agent to usher you into the established group of decision makers. Right? when you're a podcaster and you're podcast becomes popular, it's you and a room and that microphone and people did listen and there's really. Because you're putting out a good product, you don't need somebody to tell you like it's okay to do it or you're going to be on this network like that's. It doesn't matter. You can do it by yourself and that's another thing that I encourage all people to do and this is a why am able to like, even though I am stressed out, I wake up in the middle of the night, I usually, there's a lot of contradictory shit going on and I'm looking at vacation homes.

Speaker 2:          02:13:22       I love it. I fucking love doing what I'm doing. I really do. It was great. I love doing standup below the acting like I just, I love it all. And to follow your bliss, you know, and to really, I was fIring people and like you said, do you have to be up In the rain to appreciate the sunshine sake? That's where I was when I was working for somebody else, even though that somebody else was my parents and so I got down into standup. I'm like dry, look at all this great shit. I looked right. Even writing jokes are free for tim allen. Like I didn't have to do that. Like, I love doing all this stuff and so I'm really thrilled like the people that we get to associate with and the people we get to meet and what happens when you do something you love, It all just sort of comes together. So I feel very fortunate that way that I get to do all this shit and even though I need to say no, I need to pare it down. I'm still having a hard time.

Speaker 7:          02:14:14       Well it's good that you're having a blast, but uh, my advice to you is just do all those things that you're talking about, like especially do all those things as far as like meditation, do all those things, like whatever the cognitive therapy issue that you have to deal with. Just go do that. Yeah. because you, you talk about it too much. I know. Yeah. Like you and I have had like 30 conversations about your temper, you know, over like 10 years. Like that's crazy and nothing's changed. It's less because she got more and more aware of it. Right. I'm totally aware of. Right. Yeah. I've been so cool. There has not been an incident in a while except another night with steve up. Well, that was a long time ago. That was the other night we were talking about the person that cut into applause break. Oh yeah. Last week. But it was just fucking reba and again also, you know, it for a long time. I'm not a in sync. It gets also you caring about comedy. It's terrible.

Speaker 2:          02:15:17       Really caring too much about comedy. It's me being again, sacrificing a lot to do what I'm doing and then seeing other people are just trying to fucking take advantage, you know?

Speaker 7:          02:15:29       Yeah. Like I love the idea of all things comedy, um, but I don't want to do anything like that myself, which seems to me like, god, you're invested in yourself in a whole bunch of other people's problems. You know, what I've kind of done is form a network without having an actual network or all the people that I'm friends with, whether it's tom or joey or duncan, I helped them. I promote them just by just doing it. I don't want any connection on. I don't want any financial connection to it. You know, I don't even have a fucking contract. My manager, we've been together for so long like I don't either. Our contract came up and I go, I don't need a contract. You need a contract. He's like, no. Well good. shook hands. Gave him a hug so don't have to fucking nonsense legal shit. I'm never leaving him. Been with him since I was an open mic or I'm not. I'm not going anywhere else.

Speaker 2:          02:16:18       No, and that's also when we shot that a pretty, I'd say read this bird thing again. There's no contract. Beautiful. Shake hands again. I would die

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       before I fucked anybody overlay. I'm really would die. And so there's no contracts with us. It's like we're going to make to put that out there, whether it's for free or whatever, you know, just we're going to start making shit. And the most important thing is you're having a good time. Have a great time. That's awesome. Stover. Laughing. Couldn't stop. Like. It's not like. The best part about this whole thing is that you get a chance to hang out with comics, get a chance to have a good time. Just in the more you do that, the better stuff you put out, you know, the more you're in that vibe in that group, but humans, you know, just having a good time, but you're putting out those good vibes, you're getting them back, everybody's producing good stuff. Again, I can't stress enough to people listening and just finding that thing that you really liked to do and doing it is so fucking important.

Speaker 3:          02:17:18       I don't know what it is, but if you really like something itching at you because that's the thing with my parents, family business and even knowing I wanted, I knew I wanted to be a standup comic forever and it took me awhile to figure it out and so that's why I come down here and I'm racing around, like really trying to cram it all in or whatever's behind it. But I just wish that's a regret. I do have. I just started earlier. How old were you when you started telling? Tell you I was 21. That's one of those things though. I mean robert schimmel started when he was 36. Start whenever you start. Yeah. No, it doesn't matter. I think oftentimes whatever extra life that you have before you start, it's probably going to help you was when I started, I was a baby, you know, I didn't know shit about life.

Speaker 3:          02:18:06       Yeah. When I did start I was doing sales and shit. Like that was cool and Met life, met life. you've hung out with life. He'D been there. You've got down to nitty gritty. I went and essentially like a couple of years out of high school I became a comic, you know, and I was out there doing the life. I've never done anything but they have a bunch of shit along with it, but if there was ever a question, someone said, oh, you have to quit everything except one thing. What's it going to be? I'm like, that's easy. Stand up. Everything else can go fuck itself. Yeah. Yeah. without a doubt. For sure, because that's the thing. As a standup comic, we just always have this, the skills to go out and earn a living for all jay leno's faults. He danced with some pretty great stuff about.

Speaker 3:          02:18:51       There's a book called comic insights by franklin and gi where he used to teach at ucla and if you go through as interviews with richard, jenny and chris rock and jay leno and jalen was says takes you seven years, it's like a law degree, takes you seven years to get your law degree and then it takes you another seven years to be a good lawyer and then it takes you seven years to sort of figure out who you are as a comic and then another, another seven years to be a great comic. So around your 14, 15, you really started hitting your stride because you're great at it. You're getting better at it. And uh, to do that at around seven years he goes, started making a living. You can start really, you can quit your day job and really start making a fine living for your family because you're making a least like 70 to 100 is a long time ago at 70 grand a year.

Speaker 3:          02:19:41       Oh yeah. Great. Living just a, you could live. I'm going to a bunch of comics on the road that just living in Indiana fucking house costs $180,000. A couple of kids. Yeah, totally can be done. Total question and it's certainly better than doing something that you don't want to do. Exactly. For whatever. You know the people that are listening to this and they're like, what is my thing? It's gotta be something, man. You've got to be something. It might be making canoes one of those. What the fuck it is. I was so miserable doing that family business. I started doing stained glass. Stained glass is cool. Yeah. My dad did it and then I started doing. I was looking for things. I volunteered with the big brothers, big sisters. I was just held there like really? And this is again where I single and had the extra time to do anything.

Speaker 3:          02:20:28       Like this is what I'm out and I was just looking for it and then I knew when if I turned 30 and I didn't try stand up because it always had been itching at me and people always told me I should do it. Then I would never be able to live with myself, you know, so I forced myself to do it and even though it was sort of, you know, uncomfortable, well this life is like this weird quick blip and it seems long when you're young, but as you get older now I'm pushing 50, I'll be 50 this year. It just happens fast. It happens very fast and if you're not doing what you want to do, it's not a fun time. It's not a good feeling and you, we all know that person. We all know that one person that's not doing what they want to do and it eats away at them all the time instead of the people that you know that are fulfilled, that are doing things they enjoy and they're working hard and they're pushing, but they get that good feeling out of it.

Speaker 3:          02:21:16       They're actually pursuing what they love. They actually feel like they're making a difference in their life. They're actually creating something or, or accomplishing something. That's what you want to do, man. that's the key to getting those good brain chemicals, those good feelings, having good people in your life. Having good friends, being kind to people, enjoying your time in this life and then doing that thing that is actually interesting to your personality and your mind. So important. And I'm taking a step away from work. Again, those deathbed lists. You kind of look at these death bed. I don't want to. No, nope. Don't want to look at regret. I get it. I get it. I work hard. I know what I'm doing. I'm no perfect person by any stretch of the imagination, but I don't need to look at regret. I'm, I'm, I'm focused on tHat all the time. I'm trying to focus on positive things. I am absolutely aware of the consequences. You know, I've, I've, I've contemplated it enough. It's just not. I think you could spend enough time focusing on negative shit like what people should have done and it can fuck with your head. You don't want to look up when I'm Seventy and go where? I

Speaker 7:          02:22:25       don't know. You won't, you won't. I'm not gonna iF I died tomorrow, wouldn't. I'm good. You just kinda keep going. You just gotta keep enjoying it. You know? And who knows what this thing really even is so weirdest thing about this life. It's like what? What is it? I mean we, we, we look at it in terms of this like a sort of solidified structure of waking up with the alarm clock, getting your car driving to work. Meanwhile the entire time this is going on, you're a finite life form on a planet in an infinite universe. I mean all of it is preposterous from the beginning to the end. All of it's ridiculous and the more you look into it and the more you really contemplate the absolute, just massive scale of this universe that we live in, the more it seems ridiculous and the, the little things that are keeping you up at night and waking up at 2:00 in the morning, the ame zion insurance, ridiculous.

Speaker 7:          02:23:21       It's ridiculous. Shit. Ridiculous shit. Just a matter of perspective. But I think it's also a matter of the human body. I think the human body is designed to have a certain amount of stress. You certain amount of worries. The reason why we survived is because we worried about predators are invaders and all these different things. Those things don't exist anymore, so we give ourselves issues, we give ourselves problems and I think the way to mitigate that is to exercise both in the sense of like a physical sense, but also like almost in like a demonic extra cyst like get the exercise, all that stress out of your body, like you're there. Your body does not want to be like this overflowing battery of stress and tension and energy and when it is, it starts fucking with you to try to give you pressure and stress and give you like consequences for this, for this anxiety. I just have this insatiable drive that leads to that. A debilitating stress and anxiety that I don't like. So I think it's like what we're talking about. This is actually very helpful because you don't. I don't. I'm talk to anybody about this shit. I just talked to a doctor about it for the first time talking to the whole world. Then

Speaker 2:          02:24:38       5 million people are going to listen to jesus christ. Alright, I'm working on it right? I know the absolute mess. If you listened this far, I'm definitely on an absolute mess. I'm working. You'd like. All of us have issues. You. Everybody listening has issues. There's no, there's no perfect person and I, I really did at this doctor's appointment and I just flipped and I waS telling. My wife is aware of all of this and close Friends are. But I talked to his doctor for the first time. It was like talking to a complete stranger about it and all you people about it is very, very new. I don't and people are always wearing that. You know, everybody laughs at me, fucking stories of me telling People to go fuck off and they're funny. They're not violent. If

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       you meet me, you by the way at the comedy store and it's like I really am the fucking nicest guy. I am a very nice dude. But wHen pushed and pushed and pushed, I fucking lose my mind. And when I see like the comedy injustice going on, I'm like, fuck that asshole. Fuck that dick. Because it's important to you. It is a consequence of all your ambition. I mean, that's where all the stress is coming from. It's a consequence of view and it's also one of the reasons why you've been so successful that you're constantly pushing and making things happen and getting things done. But occasionally you're going to spend your wheels. I'd like to come back.

Speaker 3:          02:26:04       Complete person. No, I'm not going to happen, but the next time I come back on this show. Okay, you're going to the timeline. There's gonna be a little timeline. Timeline. I'm shit. I'm going on vacation. A long vacation. I used to flip out on vacation. How long are you on vacation for him to go away for 10 days is a long time or a date? Three. I start getting fidgety. Do you start feeling like you have work to do? I should be doing work every single day. If you go on vacation in los angeles, you will get a call to be in a movie. You can get a call to do all this other shit. And um, that's always what I haven't seen their seat. I've gotten past that because I don't do anything anymore. I just do podcast and stand up and then 10 times a year and that's it.

Speaker 3:          02:26:55       I worked for the ufc. That's all I brought. I brought it down to 10 times a year. Very great spot. Your spot is the spot that a lot of us comics want to get to. I mean, let's be honest, you because you are able to do those things because you have, you know, worked and you'd put it in all of you. Put it in a lot of time to that and I mean you working on talk radio and then working on his radio news radio. Sorry. Newsradio working on a fear factor for your, you know, ufc. I like the gin being a great comment because led to this, you were able to be independent and that's fantastic. I hope to get you definitely tend to. This fear factor thing taught me a lot because it was an independent and I didn't like doing it and it was a great job and it was a lot of money and I would definitely do it again, but it taught me the consequences of doing something that you don't really enjoy.

Speaker 3:          02:27:51       It's not pAt, I don't have a passion for. I love the people I worked with and again, it was a great job. I'm not complaining like, oh, woe is me. I had a tv gig that went 148 episodes. Crazy. Yeah, I mean this crazy successful show, but it wasn't what I wanted it to do now. So while I was doing it, it made me realize like, okay, this is not the good feeling. The good feeling is when you're doing things you want to do, so figure out a way to when this is over, never do this again. And so when fear factor was over, of course I did it again when it came again, that they. Because they came uP, they came with the money so hard to start thinking I'm a squirrel that money away. And then you know, it's only three days a week.

Speaker 3:          02:28:30       What's the big deal? You work four days, you know you have four days off, you worked three days, you know that guy who's on big bang, the show, big bang theory. The six lead. The guy, if you guys know the guy with the bowl cut is even as like simon helberg think. Um, he, I heard that he got his, uh, his deal for syndication. They wrote him a check for $85. Million dollars. Yeah. And uh, started here, but it's not the two. There's the two guys that are the main guys, right? There's the indian guy and then he's like the fifth or fourth. Yeah. And you hear about all these shows and like backing up the money truck. Just not a lot of those shows anymore though. They used to be like friends, seinfeld shows. Yeah. All those shows, those shows when news radio went to syndication, but new news radio was never the kind of commercial success.

Speaker 3:          02:29:29       And then these other shows where it actually became a success in syndication. When news radio was on television. This was when, there was not a lot of shows on tv by the way. There was one time where my friend lou morton's, one of the writers, he would, lou would wear a tee shirt that had the number that we were ranked for the week. Uh, you know, like our, our, our ratings and he came in with a number 88 on his shirt. I went, fuck dude, where 88th, he's like 88th, like god down are we going to get canceled? And the only time we got cancels when I didn't think we were going to get canceled, which is crazy. But um, I don't remember what my point was, no issue working on all these shows and that you're not doing ideally what you want, but then you know, you have a, a wife and kids and the money's so good.

Speaker 3:          02:30:17       I was thinking for the longest time they didn't want it to be like an ethnic lab brand on it and one of those in cis shows where I are, the worst guy just comes to come in and the cops come in and I go, you guys aren't gonna like this sperm came back not to sperm the sperm you think it is to. I always think of guys like david caruso. I want to think of those shows where they just kind of send it in. Yeah, they just mailing it in, do that thing with his phone and get in. Yeah, every time you ever see that compilation of him to just take him off of just saying corny one liners and pulling off the glasses. Yeah, that's what happens to you here when you do one of those shows, those shows are just designed to keep grandma awake for another hour to sell her tied and toyota trucks or whatever the fuck they're selling the commercials and then just brings me back to all things count. So atc is going to allow Just funny people to make their own shit and make it and sell it directly

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       to the people without having to do, you know, worry about this network rigmarole that we've all been piped into the network rigor bar, all that was like a real. There was, there was that option at one point in time that you thought that there was going to be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, like a syndication deal and now that stuff is almost nonexistent. They cut all those deals out. Yeah, for good reason. Awesome. Ray romano story. Yeah. About him getting his check and he sitting in one of these daily grill type places like beverly hills lunch spots where all the agents go and they go, is agency does is check that you need to probably want to just go walk away, take a look at privately, just walk away and he goes into the bathroom and he goes in and opens up the check and he looks at it and he puts it back in and it's for, you know, over $10 million type of thing.

Speaker 2:          02:32:16       And he washes his face and he can't believe it, you know, because this is a guy that was working at a bank and then he was walking back to the table and two for old ladies are sitting there and they go, excuse me, and he thinks so everybody loves raymond. He's fenced and these ladies say, could you get us some more bread please? When you have a chance. And it sort of tracking made him feel like, oh, okay, how could jesus like, this is crazy that this is happening. These Ladies have no idea who the fuck I am. They think I'm a waiter. They're asking me for more water or bread and it really took the air out of everything and made them laugh because you just got the fucking sweats. Like this is a crazy thing. There is this pot of gold for some and when I started doing standup and I still have all these deals, that's what's happening with cvs and there it's like I'm getting. I've had my own family sitcom script seven times and so like are the development deals that give you a bad deal. Slava cash slab, a cash and a script and matched up with the show runner. Show runners. Last one is called call me al. Then I wrote another one called mr macho. Mr. Macho is a good idea. Is a good script. Why the name though? Oh, so flip out a mexicans making fun of me. Was it mr macho? what's up bro?

Speaker 2:          02:33:46       Me, me living in latino neighborhoods. So then good stuff that could be a show and you want to do that? Oh man. Right now I have my own like single camera comedy on the air and yeah, you like that as much as standup. I love acting. I love writing, making shit. Yeah. That's awesome. Then. Yeah, and I really enjoy it. Like it's got to be in the writer's room on. I'm dying up here. There's one of the best experiences are. And when does that come out? When it's on showtime. Beautiful hair. You're gonna. Love it so much I'm sure. And it's kind of sexy bitch. Look at you and that god damn amazing outfit and that beautiful mustache. Whoa. I love it.
