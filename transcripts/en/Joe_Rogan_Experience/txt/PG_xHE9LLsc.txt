Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Yes, and we're live. Welcome back, Mr Wood. Thanks for having me buddy. It could. It's been a wild year for people who don't know. Michael was a former, um, you were. Well, you never really a former marine, right? Isn't that one of those things where you're a marine, you stay marine.

Speaker 2:          00:00:19       I don't quite buy that. If I, if I would have stayed maybe, but uh, for the Marines who agree with that. Okay. You were

Speaker 1:          00:00:26       marine, a former sergeant in the Baltimore Police Department and he came on the podcast a while back and expose some pretty eyeopening information about how the whole system sort of works in this sort of a kind of a closed loop in, in Baltimore where the same neighborhoods are having the same kind of crime in the same sort of scenarios over and over again. And that was a really important podcasts for me and it was really important podcast for a lot of people that listen to it because they got exposed to the inner workings of police departments by someone who's, you know, I was really happy how honest you were about all of it. About the thrill of chasing people and uh, all of all the cool stuff about it and we scheduled this podcast quite a while ago and it's kind of crazy that you're coming in the weekend after these insane shootings in Orlando and I'm, I'm absolutely not happy that that happened, but I'm happy. Is happy as I could be that your here while this is all going down and we get to kind of talk about these, these moments, these insane moments that happen. It seems like every few months or so, some new insane moment happens where some person, usually a man blows a fuse and winds up killing a ton of people.

Speaker 1:          00:02:00       I don't know what, if anything, and I'm hoping maybe you'll have some insight. What if anything could ever be done to stop something like this?

Speaker 3:          00:02:11       Well,

Speaker 2:          00:02:13       this is where we get into the Mike Rhodes a dirty liberal thing and we're going to start talking about gun control because I don't know what else we can talk about. Your only other option is to continue a cycle of more and more force upon one another. So what we know for sure without a doubt that the path we're on, it is only a matter of time before this record is broken. Right? So what we're doing will result in that, but we have this anti-intellectualism in America that just won't take that evidence and apply it to what we know is going to be the end result like it. We have countries that have done gun control, they don't have mass shootings, we have mass shootings literally on the daily in America. You just don't hear about them all. So when a mass shooting is generally characterized three or four more casually, something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:03:07       But this happens every day in the cities doesn't really. Yeah. You don't hear about it when it's a backyard barbecue shooting in the right. Yeah. So that you can think of that. Um, a lot of people don't categorize those as mass shootings because think of mass shootings is someone going into a crowded place and killing a bunch of civilians or innocent people I should say. Whereas they think of those kinds of shootings in the hood as rival gangs, people competing over drug dealing territory. Things along those lines, which is another point because you were running for you, you wanted to be the head of police of Chicago. Is that still going on? No, I mean they certainly, uh, the corruption went in and uh, so we can tell that story real quick. What they did is they did a national search, so the laws in Chicago said that this appointed police board has to do a nationwide search and then they give three names to the mayor.

Speaker 2:          00:04:05       The mayor investigates those people and then chooses one. So I predicted they weren't going to go with me. I'm too far ahead still that no one's really ready to take that bite yet, but it's still something we could have talked about and they would have had the opportunity. I figured they would pick that, uh, that I figured they'd pick a black guy who was educated and not from Chicago. That was my prediction. And that's who the police board did choose. They chose a guy from Atlanta who fit that bill to the t. He was going to be the black guy that represents the police department but still totes their line. I'm thinking of a word that everybody knows and I'm just not saying it so you can all pick up on what I'm suggesting. You're saying uncle Tom and people have an uncle Tom, but he's a nice guy, so if you have an uncle and his name's Tom, don't worry about it.

Speaker 2:          00:04:58       So that's what they're gonna. Look for something that will visually seems satisfying. I see instructionally be exactly the same. So they chose that guy and the mayor still said, yeah, I don't know what that guy I want you was this guy that didn't even apply and that skews the commissioner. So who is this guy that didn't imply he was a couple of ranks down. I'm already in the agency. He is a. He said that he has never seen misconduct or corruption in the Chicago Police Department and his entire 20 some year career, he is intimately tied into a cheating scandal, a promotional test. Another thing that you could solve easily. So his friends like wife or something got number one, the lieutenant's test, which is extremely a qualifying. So say. And as soon as the information comes down that he actually was the one that was developing the tests, had the answers, and then she gets this super high score out of nowhere is when everybody says, oh, come on, we've seen this before, we know what it is, so you can solve it.

Speaker 2:          00:06:11       You could retest them. Right. And see who does it. But at first of course not. So they're not going to do that. Did they have any interest in exposing thing? So if I'm going to come in there and I'm going to say, all right, that's it. We're going to be transparent, I don't think there. Okay. So now when you say that you were a little too far ahead, what do you mean by that? Well, it seems the people of a city or of any area have to be pushed hard enough to, to have that change. Like they have to have that breaking point where they say that's it. We're going to do something different. Because what I really push is for civilian controlled policing. I want you guys to tell me what what should be done, which is a huge drop in power, so that's. That would require a mayor that's willing to give in to the people that have pushed hard enough to say, look, I'm going to relinquish control of my essential armed wing and I'm going to give it to the people, and so it's been done before. Not that I'm aware of. Not In America. It's certainly hasn't. So who's going to be the city that takes that leap? It has to come. It has to. We all know it, so it's a matter of fact.

Speaker 1:          00:07:17       Well, what they've tried to do in some areas like in New Jersey in particular, is force these people to integrate more into the community, make them walk the beat, which is not like, you don't hear about that anymore. Now everyone's in a car and you're driving around this closed up vehicle. Whereas before everybody was walking around and you were sort of like, oh, there's officer Mike, you know, he's a part of the community and they get it. It became normal to see these people, they develop friendships with the people that were in their neighborhood that they were patrolling and it's sort of ingrained. She hated them more. I think having a bunch of people that you don't know, patrolling your streets with guns in a car just driving around and you know, hardly ever getting out and

Speaker 2:          00:08:01       they're arresting somebody. That's a little odd, right? Well yeah, but I don't see that the foot patrol is the solution to that because what they do is they put a facade on it so they make it look like foot patrol, but it still has his essential underpinnings of, of being motivated to go and make arrests and to get the stats. So I did four patrol for like six months and that's what it was. It was just being thrown into get drug arrests. I didn't know anybody or meet anybody. It was still those same pushing to get somebody, put them in a, in a prison cell, do the paperwork, go back out and do it again. So what we really need is to change the incentives and disincentives so that no matter what the role, we're still going towards that objective that actually serves you. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:08:52       I had Dave Smith and the other day, excuse me, I'm Dave Smith, who is a hilarious standup comedian and he's also a on this podcast called Legion of skanks and he's a libertarian, very smart guy, but he was, he was bringing up a point about New York after the shootings in New York where a bunch of cops had gotten shot. Um, um, there was this sort of a cool off period where they had just stopped arresting people for Bullshit and the bullshit arrests, like loose cigarettes, things along those lines just dropped substantially. And people were really excited about that. They were like, look, this is like a good step. Like, this is really how it should be. The police shouldn't be glorified revenue collectors just arresting people for the taxes last on loose cigarettes. And that's what killed Eric Gardner. Right? Precisely. Yeah. I mean, it's disgusting. It's not, it's not policing because not hurting anybody. Policing should be protecting and serving. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:09:51       I'm really glad that you brought up that instance in New York, so what that is is direct evidence against what the head of the FBI has said Komi who's coming in these pushing this ferguson effect, right? So the idea around there saying, oh, we have crime going up in these different neighborhoods because there's this ferguson effect that the cops are laying back so they're not being as proactive and because they're not being as proactive, then they're not locking people up. So. So stats are going up and we know that if you have a theory and there's one situation that says your theories complete crap when your theory theories complete crap, and that's what New York was. So New York, they step back and they want it to be like, oh, look how much you need us. And didn't show that the stats showed lower crime. They had less calls for service. Everybody was happier with what was going on because that is, we want to say that policing should prevent things and it's just not possible. Police are there to clean things up and to investigate after the fact. Every arrest should be viewed as a failure of the system. We shouldn't praise and arrest. That is when we failed. That's an interesting way of looking at it. I think

Speaker 1:          00:11:06       another way to look at it that's maybe more a more common ground is your fucking with people. When you're. When you're around them all the time and you're like, what's going on over there? Boys? You know like that kind of shit. You're fucking with them. You create intention. Intention creates arguments. It creates crime. It creates resentment. It creates anger. All those things contribute to crime 100 percent and when you fuck with people over loose cigarettes or any sort of nonsense, petty crime that nobody gives a shit about. That kind of stuff isn't. It's not good for anybody. It's not good for the relationship that police have with citizens. It's not good for the perception of the citizens of, of the way they view the police. You make some view the police as these, these thugs

Speaker 2:          00:11:46       which citizens though a significant amount and the citizens in this country very much like that. The fact that police do that well did they don't live there, right? But if they were poor and they lived in those communities, they wouldn't feel like you always do this. You hit on these big issues because you're just like, well wait, this is obvious. It's right in front of our face and what they're doing is they are funded and you know, so you have a mayor in Baltimore, the mayor directs the police department's a way, no matter what city you're in, and what that person is doing is they're serving those, those rich people, they're serving, uh, the mass voters of the area who just had that mentality still that they want those animals caged in sentiment and to keep them there. So as long as it doesn't affect us, then who cares? Right. That's really what you're hitting on there is that they, I don't know that more of this country doesn't want our police to be that way. I think they are happy about it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       I think you're probably right, but I think they're misinformed and I think they have this, this incorrect understanding of how that affects the people that these cops are interacting with and that that it actually does probably create more crime and then on top of that, I think there's also the problem with those people that are in those poor communities could just as easily be Uri, if we were born into those situations and we were talking about giving people an opportunity to get out, given people a possibility to get out and do better and improve their situation, their standing in life, well, if they're getting fucked with all the time, that's not going to happen. If they're in a terrible poverty laden crime laden community, good luck with that. Good luck getting out of that. It becomes almost insurmountable and I think it's real convenient for people to be outside of that and and look at those folks and go, well, those people need to stop doing crime. What you need to do is just lock them all up. Well, that doesn't seem to make sense. It seems much more likely that the best way to handle that is to lock them up less and to sort of somehow or another try to calm that area down and I don't know how you would do it. I mean, whether it's through some universal basic income idea, which I've been paying a lot of attention to that lately and trying to explore those ideas and see if I can read my own,

Speaker 2:          00:14:17       call me a socialist and you're talking about minimum.

Speaker 1:          00:14:19       It wasn't my idea. It was. It was an idea that Eddie Huang brought up on the podcast and I initially laughed at him. I was like, nobody's going to fucking go for that. And then I started reading some articles on it and I started thinking about it and financially the issue is where's that money come from? And you're obviously gonna. It's a shit ton of money that's going to have to somehow or another come out of something else. And I'm not A. I'm not a financial person. I don't understand the economy. I'm not an economist so I'm not the person to do the numbers, but when I think about it like objectively

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       as far as from a social stance, when people have less problems, when bills are paid easier, when they're more relaxed as far as like where food's coming from, where you know, what basic needs are covered, they're less likely to commit crime. So it just makes sense that you would have to spend less money on law enforcement, less money on prisons, less money on jails, and that perhaps that could translate. There was a great article written by, see if you could find A. Jamie's is some prominent libertarian who wrote this piece about universal basic income is the idea is essentially giving people $13,000 a year that if you give Americans through essentially a thousand bucks plus a month and that if you did that, you would take care of a shitload of problems that we have in inner cities and crime and all this. And he a sort of outlined it and made a, a, a pretty interesting case for this idea.

Speaker 4:          00:15:51       Um, but of course you've got a lot of people that want to go on and on about welfare babies and, and, and people that are juking the system and buying cigarettes with food stamps and you know, things along those lines, but it's like this callous sort of approach to dealing with really poor people in really bad neighborhoods. And one of the things that you brought up about Baltimore that made it so disturbing was that black people had to buy houses in these areas. They would not sell houses in certain areas to black people. And that this was like a law. And this was actually written. Dennis was not, not like everybody conspired. This was something that they actively set out to do. They, the, this idea of caging them, keeping them in, they, they, they literally did that through paperwork. Right? And that's a, so things that you're talking about and like that sociologists that has that study, we, we know these things.

Speaker 4:          00:16:47       So what you're observing is things that the scholarly community has known for a long time and is trying to, to get these things out there so that people understand this. It's not even a matter of how much is this going to cost because we're already spending the money that we're spending a lot more this book, this is why I brought it with me because I just finished going through it. It was just put out. So this is by a Johns Hopkins researcher and Stefanie Deluca who's a friend of mine, you know, so everybody knows that I am saying it, but she, they did a study, they followed Baltimore youth around for well over a decade. I think it was like 15, 16 years and their path that they go through and part of that was it costs $27, billion dollars to America every single year for disconnected youth. So that's just youth that don't have a drive and don't have a focus or how is that, um, money? How does it trickle down so they don't chase things, right? So you get stuck in this, this, this idea

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       that you can't escape this neighborhood because we have so many blockades in the way. There are stories that go through. They track like a hundred and some people, parents having kids in these neighborhoods. And moving them out and what happened to them and the two biggest pushers for the success of these have any kid in these cities was that they had an identity project, which means they're finding their passion and what they're going to go towards because they don't know these passions. They don't know that a photographer like Devin Allen, who a friend of mine in Baltimore can, can come out and do things for their community and can actually achieve that dream. So once they see it and it's possible and you start taking the hurdles down, like the hurdles of where they live and the hurdles of the arrest for the bag of weed or for, like you said, the, the talking yourself into jail because the cops messing with you every single day and you're saturated with police in these neighborhoods. You start taking down these barriers and these kids excel and it goes completely against the narrative that we're hearing that these kids don't have motivation and they can't push out. Eighty percent of these kids that grow up in the city never touched the streets or have anything to do with it. They're getting high school degrees at four or 500 percent. The rate of their parents, it's just that what we keep doing is we keep getting them behind and they're still fighting super hard, but we're still throwing more and more hurdles in their wet,

Speaker 1:          00:19:17       so the money that you're talking about how much it costs for these disconnected use. This is all in prisons.

Speaker 2:          00:19:26       This isn't even phrase it. What is. This is just the lack of their product productivity from achieving what they can achieve and what it's costing us to then take care of of what the fallout is in that, that, that just that microcosm. We're not throwing in locking up everybody else. We're not throwing in the parents. We're not throwing in all this other stuff. Just youth that don't have a passion.

Speaker 1:          00:19:49       Well, this is one of the subjects that come up over and over again on this podcast because I've always tried to figure out what it is that keeps people from trying to socially engineer these, these environments and make them better for the people that live there. Like we're always concentrating on all these other countries. We're concentrating on helping Afghanistan and rebuilding Iraq and all the stuff that we do, humanitarian efforts all over the world. Right. What about our own inner city?

Speaker 2:          00:20:18       I think they do. I think they're misguided, so what we end up doing is we have this idea that we're rich and often white and we're going to come in and we're going to have the handout or we're going to give them what we want. We're going to show them the right way and that's not the answer. The answer is to ask what they want and provide the structure and platform for that to take place. So when these smart people that haven't been there, they'll look at stats and they'll look at the paperwork and they'll say, oh, we just need to move people out and relocate them, or we need to. The idea was, all right, well we'll put them in this big tower and we're have resources around them and everything will be fine and we're making sure they have their own police department so everything will be will be good, but then the police started locking everybody up and you just.

Speaker 2:          00:21:07       You get into that cycle again because you're not giving the identity project even to adults, adults where you can say whether it's comedy or whether it's photography or no matter what, you have to have that goal, that vision because all they see is that their future is in dealing or in a prison cell and they keep being told that if they do the right things they can move on, but when they do the right things are sometimes good intentions have put up the roadblocks that prevent them from doing that. So what but how do you.

Speaker 5:          00:21:41       You sort of engineer, for lack of a better term, a whole society. Like how do you give them goals? How do you, how do you expose them to all these possibilities

Speaker 2:          00:21:53       and how do you set up pass? You just said the word expose. They're isolated. They don't know. Right, but how do you do that though? I think social media is helping a ton so they can see and interact with people that are different from them and they can see, oh look, this kid from New York, he did get into this school and he has this job now and now I can maybe go work for his company or whatever it is. They see these examples of success and then they start to pick them up and chase them and that's what these stats and all this bookers showing that. It's staggering how much effort these kids are putting in to their goals. It's just that we're actually setting up the prevention of it by doing things like, oh, okay. We charge a black kid in the city. You know, you charge him.

Speaker 2:          00:22:46       He commits a homicide because he was defending his sister from getting raped, but when he gets a prison sentence, we know that that prison sentence just slams him. But when it's a white kid from Sanford, you know what happens. So it's kind of this. I don't want to push empathy all the time, but there is that, that empathy angle, but it's just kind of helping people get where they want to get instead of pushing them where you think they should be. They'll find their own paths. It's like we treat poor people like they're children and they're not. They're poor people.

Speaker 5:          00:23:20       There's a dude who works at the comedy store who was a criminal defense attorney and he resigned. He stopped doing it because he got tired of his. When he was bringing cases to trial. If it was a white guy, the white guy would get, you know, whatever, six months for an identical crime, a young black guy would get 10 years and he was like, you've got to. Someone's got to tell me what the fuck is going on here, because all I'm looking at

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       is systematic racism. I'm looking at institutional racism. He was like, this is just over and over and over again. I'm confronted by the same kind of people, the same age brackets, but completely different types of sentences. And, uh, what's the mentality behind it? And he said everybody wanted to just bury their head head in the sand and he couldn't do it anymore. It was so strong. I mean, when the guy talks about he's like smoking cigarettes and freaking out because it was just a huge 10 years of his life and it was just too much. He couldn't do it anymore. That kind of shit is almost insurmountable when you. You're living in that world and you are one of those people that gets sent down the river for 10 years for something that you know, if you were a white Irish kid, you would get six months or you know, a much lesser sentence. That alone is got to be a gigantic hurdle for someone living in these environments. And this is not saying that people shouldn't be punished for crimes. They definitely should be punished for crimes. But for sure about that, they also should be punished. Absolutely. It should be our view for be our view. Do you think they should do about murder? She punish them or just give him a hug?

Speaker 2:          00:24:53       It was certainly depend on the situation, but I can't help but keep coming back to the fundamental idea that our criminal justice system is based on punishment like that. It's not a moral system. It's like the death penalty. We know that these things don't work. So now now do they get rights taken away? So what I would like to see is, let's take for instance, we know that it costs so-and-so thousands of dollars a year to house. Somebody thinks 24,000 depends on where you are though. So a college degree from an online school that's accredited, which we can all do easily right now would cost way less than that. So put them in a, in a, in a cell, and you keep them around, but you treat them like human beings. You give them an identity, a goal where they can achieve something and they actually. Because right now we send them into a prison of punishment and what happens when they come out, they're in a worse situation. So now we've created a greater criminal than we had before. So our goal is supposed to be some kind of rehabilitation that this is a better person when they leave than when they go in. But we have that in us. We want these fuckers to pay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:01       Well, certainly for murder, I mean for the families of someone that they victimized, they don't want this person to come out better.

Speaker 2:          00:26:07       Not even all victims feel that way though, you know, and it, it's so there are plenty of murder victims who, who their parents have gone and asked for leniency for, for the person, or ask the not give him the death penalty because that's pretty fucking rare that it is. Yes, yes. Most people want revenge, but we have to look beyond that because you know when, when your sister gets in a fight and killed your neighbor, who's your friend or something like that, you're not asking for the death penalty. Right? Because it's close to you. Well, the others, we do that to others. We wouldn't do that to the ones we know well, threats to society, those. That's the real

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       issue with some people, White, black, whatever. Someone's associate, associate pass some as a psycho. They're a threat to society, like I'm the guy who killed all those people in the theater in Denver. That's a psycho. I mean that. That guy needs to be locked up forever. Right? Okay. You don't need to know about it. Well, what do you do about a person like that? I mean, how do you. How do you take a person like that and you give them goals in prison? Do you try to give them an education mean? Obviously,

Speaker 2:          00:27:08       think about that. He could become, not not him obviously saying he doesn't mental illness, but somebody else you could educate them why they're there and they can contribute to literature and contribute to science. They can give back to some society in some way.

Speaker 5:          00:27:21       Is that financially feasible? How much more money would it take to make prison a safer environment for people that are locked up? I mean were the idea is that we're supposed to be protecting the rest of us from these people that have committed these awful crimes, right? Someone's committed rape, someone's committed murder or armed robbery. We separate them from us because we don't want them to victimize anymore people. Then goal number two is rehabilitation and that goal is overwhelmingly a failure. Overwhelmingly, if you look at the statistics, if we sit in, it's been attempted. Yeah, that's a good point. I mean, we'll do our, I mean Rick Ross, the guy that we've had on before, the real rick Ross, not the rapper guy. Um, he, I mean he learned how to read and literally figured out what was wrong with his case in prison.

Speaker 2:          00:28:09       Do that though. A lot of them won't give them any access at some do. So there are wardens out there that are progressive and are thinking of these things.

Speaker 5:          00:28:16       So that shouldn't really be on the warden. Honda should be some sort of a standard nationwide, what we should look at it as a culture, as a society, as a civilization and say, hey, you know, what, what should we be trying to do to try to make these people better people?

Speaker 2:          00:28:30       Right? And you do that when you arrest them though. So what we say now is when he goes and shoots or when someone rapes, we're not looking at it at that as that failure. So if you, if you were running this business and an asset, a facet of your business failed, then you would want to have an analysis and you would want to say, all right, let's do a regression and figure out what went wrong and you would want to fix that for the next time. But we don't do that. We just go, all right, throw that one away and continue. Path is normal. We shouldn't be so focused when we arrest somebody to figure out how we're going to throw them away from the longest. We should be figuring out why it happened so we can prevent it for the next person. But it doesn't seem like we actually care about solving the crime. We're just keeping these wheels turning. So if you commit murder than I want to know why. I want to know the scenarios that led you up to that because the only way that I can actually prevent that is not minority report. It's finding out what that hurdle was. That moment that you said, fuck this. And finding ways to prevent that as much as possible or reduce it for other people.

Speaker 5:          00:29:34       Lot of it must have to do with the developmental period that you go through when you're a young person and what you're exposed to as a small

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       child. I mean that stuff becomes so deeply ingrained in a person's mind to try to reverse that boy is so much harder than to try to race someone correctly the first time. All that's in this book, they talk about that is coming of age in the other America that they talk about these things where that's one of the predictors is how much exposure to violence that these kids have had when they were going between the ages of zero and 10, and so when they got them out of the city and they gave him opportunities than they got exposed to less violence. The really crazy thing in this study is that we found out that the kids that were in this city that didn't get help, they also fought their way out. Actually a higher rate. So we did these nice things and we have to tweak it, but like are nice things that we did actually didn't pan out in the same results as kids that were just fighting on their own.

Speaker 2:          00:30:35       So explain that. Yeah, yeah. It's wild. So they had these housing voucher programs where they would. The idea was to take people out of those neighborhoods and put them into nicer neighborhoods where they would be exposed to less things. They would have neighbors around that that did things that was very beneficial when, when that happened, but about an equal percentage of those kids went back, ended up being in the low income areas and get involved in to the streets. And then the ones that fought themselves out on their own ended up at a higher, slightly higher percentage actually getting out and being exposed to less because of their own individual efforts and the control group trying to get out of there. So while it says that the programs need some tweaking, but it shows that it's counter narrative that these kids aren't trying and that they're not succeeding to get out.

Speaker 2:          00:31:23       Like they are pushing super hard to make something of themselves and our cultural idea is like, oh look at these kids are not doing anything. They're just turning to drugs and they're just dealing and surprisingly they're not. It is a 12 percent of the kids raised in Baltimore in this study ever spent and these are in the worst neighborhoods. It's east and West Baltimore ever spent a moment on the streets doing any criminal activity. Twelve percent staggering. I'm going to have shocked. I feel dumb because I did the same things like Yo. So they're exposed to. Right, but it's not. They're fighting out like crazy and we're the ones stopping them from coming to fruition. Well not US society. We're responsible, right? Like so what are we mean? Here's the thing. It's like how much effort is actually being done to try to fix this? I mean how many people are actually thinking about it? How much money is actually being spent to try to fix this? It seems like there's so many problems in the world that to concentrate on bad neighborhoods or crime ridden neighborhoods, it's so low on the list of things. The world's worried about. The polarized caps are melting. Polar bears are drowning, you know, there's so much shit we're worried about on top of that. They're trying hard as hell to keep it the way it is though and was trying hard. Governments are in Baltimore

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       for example, there's this, this patent, that thing that I'm a professor from Morgan state. Lawrence Brown is really into this and tracks it all down, but there is a white l, we call it the White Allen Baltimore. It goes down through the rich neighborhood and comes across to the other rich neighborhoods by the bay and then there's the black butterfly which comes off to the sides East and West Baltimore and it looks like butterfly wings dispersing out poverty and black people in the city and what this is in every single aspect that you're going to find. Where that. Where the money goes for schools. Where are the bus routes are? Where the free buses, like the white neighborhoods have a free bus and the black neighborhoods have to pay for their bus. Yes. So we have all these things that no matter what you think of this white out and this black butterfly come to fruition. I'm on where resources are allocated and what problems are. How is that possible that white people don't have to pay for the bus and the black people do. That seems ridiculous when you want me to tell you that they, it's the neighborhood because the neighborhoods, you know, so they're not serving the white people. They're serving those upper class neighborhood.

Speaker 4:          00:33:48       But is it a, is it a tax issue? Is it a property tax issue where they spent money for the buses? All Baltimore city. So all the money. So how the fuck could they justify that they, they just do it and nobody cares. I mean it's, it's so people should follow them. It's at be more dark on twitter. He, he lays this out in so many different avenues. You, you just, you have to be willfully ignorant to not realize that this is going on at Bemer doc. Okay, that's, that's insane. Now how much of it is dealing with a prison guard unions and police unions that are trying to keep business as usual because that keeps people employed or that's a significant portion and you're seeing that with the NRA and you're seeing that with the police unions and like you said, the correctional unions were and like see, even them, they don't have these bad intentions. What they have is job preservation

Speaker 2:          00:34:44       comes back to those incentives and disincentives, so they're fighting for their job and that's all they're thinking. Well, we want jobs, we want safer conditions. I want to make sure that this is a big company that blows up, so they're gonna put their money towards politicians that support them and that's just the way it goes this way. It's always been, as long as we have money in politics, you can't get away from that.

Speaker 4:          00:35:02       Well, the most transparent example that is marijuana that we've shown time and time and again with a million different studies that marijuana is not dangerous or if it is dangerous. The danger that it poses is so minimal. It's so small that consenting adults should be able to do whatever the fuck they want with it and yet prison guard unions and police unions still lobby to keep the drug laws exactly the same way they are because that ensures that you're gonna need a certain amount of guards. You're going to need a certain amount of police officers. That's counterintuitive. It being that's dangerous for society because that sets up this us versus them mentality where it doesn't need to be where you're telling people there's a certain forbidden plant that they're not allowed to use. We've decided this, we're going to keep it this way even though it's completely illogical, even though we know the history of it and we're going to do it simply because people want to keep their jobs instead of trying to figure out what other jobs these people can do like shouldn't there be a way you could take some of these people that are prison guards or police officers and give them a job with a commensurate income that's involved in helping communities.

Speaker 4:          00:36:15       Something positive, something setting up community programs. I mean how many guys that are cops who were also into martial arts or fitness or into something else, or you know, anything where they could teach people in these communities, set up community centers and give people high paying jobs to establish really good environments for development and for growing and give people a chance to be exposed to maybe one of these things that could be these paths that you were talking about. Yeah, I mean I have. Obviously I'm gonna have zero objections to that. I mean that that's a great way of going about it and cannabis is obviously the shining example of complete illogic. They just did a new study where they tracked people for 30 years. You know what health problems they found, what ginger vidas bad breath. They just didn't brush her teeth. The hippies didn't brush their soki breath.

Speaker 4:          00:37:06       Hippies study people said they said the same thing, but that probably goes because segment of the population. Yeah, and it doesn't have anything to do with the cannabis. That's hilarious. So we know without a doubt that, that that's the case. But what we can do, so say you still want to do that and we only have to change them that far to, to get them away from the drug where even though that's, that's probably the biggest chunk that's fucking everything up is the drug war. But if we spend that money, instead of incarcerating them, we can spend the money in education. So for every million dollars that spent fighting the drug war on the supply side, there's a 100 kilogram reduction of, of supply. So, uh, if, if you have the kilograms of cocaine coming over the border, if you fight it with force, you fight the supply side, then you get a 10 gram per kilogram reduction.

Speaker 4:          00:37:56       But if you spend that same million dollars on the demand side educating people, you have a reduction of 100 kilograms. Whoa. So we, that's, where's this from? I don't know. Somebody can look it up. It's really easy to find it right away. That's very logical and it makes sense to me. So we know that if you just educate people and tobacco is the shining example of that is tobacco rates have gone down like crazy. Now let's take the hair gardner situation out of that. The large part of that has been because of education. So you educate people out of drugs, educate people, you know, like they say all the time. If, if heroin is on Amazon right now to you order it. No, I don't know how to

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       write. I don't know about Jamie and Tara when freak. He loves it. He gets a bunch of different styles and mixes them up. So it's prohibition. That messes us up. Yeah. And we know that. And when you have prohibition, you are not determining what happens to the drugs. All you're doing is determining who is distributing the drugs because they will be distributed. The question is, is it the government and I e the people doing the distribution or is it the black market, the gangs in the mafia? Well, as long as it's under prohibition, it's the black market and the gangs in the Mafia. We, we literally know this. There's nothing to discuss. And yet we continue with this anti intellectual asm and denial at that. That's kind of, it runs throughout our society in America. Speaking about the guns, you know, we're dealing with the same thing where it's just constant. We have evidence we can prove things empirically and we still continue to do the opposite for for reasons I just can't get my mind wrapped around lake. It's were I feel like I'm fighting denial and it's been like a year that I fighting this denial and talking on radio shows constantly. But yet, you know, a couple months ago we pull up the Internet and the FBI director is pushing the ferguson effect and it's just like fuck, like how do we get past this?

Speaker 1:          00:39:55       Well, I think that we're dealing with two completely different subjects, right? The gun control subject is a very different subject than trying to figure out how to elevate people in bad neighborhoods. The gun control subject is, you know, if you look at the statistics of how many Americans have guns, how many rounds of ammunition there are, how many armed people there are in this country. And then you look at how many crimes there are, how many gun shootings there are. It's relatively small, very small. We're dealing with massive numbers of people.

Speaker 2:          00:40:28       Yeah, I mean if you. There's $3 million, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:33       There's $300, million plus people in this country. So if you look at this, this blip on the map where every few months someone goes fucking crazy and killed a bunch of people. If we really had a an armed problem in this country, the logic that the anti gun control people use would be that you would see way more shootings and you would see them all the time. If we really had a gun control problem, you have so many armed people. If it was a real issue, but the issue would they try to say, and I'm not picking the team here, but what they try to say is that what we're dealing with, just massive numbers of people, massive numbers of people. The number $300 million is so hard for the average person like you were. I to wrap our head around what that means in terms of the volume, the sheer volume of people and how many guns are out there. This has many guns, more guns, and there are people in this country which is even more insane, and the

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       the people that own these guns for the most part are law abiding citizens that don't do anything wrong. Why take away their rights? Because some dude like this asshole in Orlando goes fucking crazy and kills 50 gay people exist that have a couple of premises there and one of them was that they have a right to that weapon. Right? Which I'm going to argue to the end of the day that they don't. Okay. The second amendment is clear. Well regulated militia. It's literally clear. It says it in black and white, well regulated militia and even if we go to bear arms, sure. Right. Even if we go past that, forget that I'm not a big fan of the constitution and leaning on it because the world is changed dramatically. We're in a whole new situation. Rethink with the evidence that we have now. Let's not rely on the document that's on parchment somewhere decaying, right?

Speaker 4:          00:42:23       So written with a feather. That's why they made it amendable. So the first thing is that they have that right? I don't think they have the right. And the second is that that number is acceptable. I see what you're trading in there is what are you getting? So if you have an equation where they can have these guns. So what are you benefiting and what are you losing? Tell me what is the society we benefit from handguns and rifles? Well, the people that have been able to protect themselves against dangerous crime, the people that have been able to stop people from breaking into their home, stealing their property, harming them physically or protecting their level. So when you talk about ratios, there's 30,000 hand gun crimes in America every year, right? That's it. The document it have shootings. 30,000. So I thought it was way more than that.

Speaker 4:          00:43:17       So if we take the percentage of people that defended themselves, I mean you've got five to 10 cases a year like that doesn't actually occur, but what are they defending themselves against those people with handguns and rifles. So you're in, you're trapped in this circular logic where you need a gun because I have a gun and then eventually Jamie says, well those fuckers have a gun. I want to gun two. And we know where that goes. We literally know it keeps getting more and more and more. Now if we have this perpetual society where everyone has everything and everything's perfect, but that's just not gonna happen, we're going to have strife and a lot of these guns are concentrated in a few people's hands that have 200 guns. You know, dudes that have 50 guns. I know dudes that 50 guts. I know due to so many guns.

Speaker 4:          00:44:08       Justin, I'm talking about you motherfucker. My Buddy Justin has so many guns. He doesn't know know how many guns do you have? So they have those instances of giant. He's seven feet tall and he has 150,000 fucking guns. So they have, they have them in a safe or they have them out in rural America where they're not even like interacting with people like to have the strife. Well, he's a firearms enthusiastic and he is also a guy with a squeaky clean criminal record. What's the argument against him being able to be a firearms enthusiast and possess all these guns because of what it's done to our society. He just wants to have something. And I've talked to in particular, I know, but I'm just saying it because he's my friend. So anybody, anybody. What are you gaining? So there's an equation in one, one side of the equation, we have 30,000 hand gun victims, we have a society that's gripped by fear.

Speaker 4:          00:45:00       We have dudes that can go get an ar 15 and days later, light up a nightclub and do a hate crime. We know that that's gonna happen. And we know that as the future progresses, that that 103 casualties of this shooting is going to be superseded by a bigger shooting that that's going to happen because you know, we got to break the records right? And so, and we're going to have more and more guns that keep coming in and keep coming. So that's when the right hand side of the equation and on your left hand side of the equation for, for having guns, the argument is, well I like them. Well, there's also the argument that a well armed society is a polite society and that there were people that had guns in that nightclub. They would've been able to prevent that crime by taking that guy out.

Speaker 4:          00:45:41       There were eight cops. I mean that was the same thing in Denver. Like if there were cops there, but the cops are getting shot by the cops get to a point where I wasn't there. A hostage situation. I mean I don't know the details about Florida. So it's a, it's really problematic. We're true. Cops wouldn't get killed, right? They have the biggest army. That's when our streets. So if more guns we keep having more cops with more and bigger guns then it would stop. Right? Because the cops, the cops roll in armored vehicles with ar fifteens to combat juveniles dominant mall during the uprising. So don't more cops shoot more criminals than criminal shoot cops don't more cops kill more people that are trying to commit crimes than those people. Of course, that is predicated upon the premise that they're trying to shoot the cops and they're absolutely not.

Speaker 4:          00:46:29       We're trying to get away some of them. Sure. The ones that are actively trying to shoot cops are super smart because you got to read. You're saying the cops are getting shot when they do get shot. Right? Right, right. But what I'm saying is yes, but isn't that sort of an argument that. No, no, no, you bet. And there is one guy with a rifle that he purchased legally and a bunch of cops and a bunch of cops. The cops still get shot. Right. But a lot of those jobs. But a lot of those guys that you're talking about, this one guys like the remember the north Hollywood shootout famous of course arm to the fucking gills and wearing body armor and all that shit. They were. The cops were just so outgunned as far as fire power. Sure. So our answers that they get more firepower right now. That's not saying that's the answer to keep having. This is one of the reasons why these cops are getting shot. They're getting shot and killed in that situation in particular because they're walking around with 38 revolver, nine millimeter glock getting shot because that guy has armor and a fucking air through and saying,

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       this is what I'm saying is they don't adequately. Armed with a handgun would be perfectly fucking fine if we didn't have ar 15 saturating our streets. Will that guy. I don't even think he had an ar 15. You had something like that. It's all heavy shit. That's all. Okay. Yeah, so like which by the way, it's the same gun as an m 16 folks. It's A. It's a military weapon. It's the same gun that was created. It was created in the fifties to deal with the AK 47. There was an HPO, a part series on real sports recently that talked about it. They were talking about Ar 15 in two to three can do that damage. That's a semiauto and we get caught up in the assault weapons and the assault weapons are going to keep you having better aim. They're going to keep you having a higher magazine capacity.

Speaker 2:          00:48:16       Could be a little more reliable weapon, but have a hunting rifle with a 10 magazine clips. That's a two to three and it's a semiautomatic is gonna do the exact same level of damage that we're talking about. So my position on gun control is extremely simple. You want your guns for these other things like say hunting bolt, action rifles and shotguns. There you go. Everything that you can that's on your, on the pro gun side that they want to achieve can all be accomplished by shotguns and bolt action rifles. Well, yeah, I see that argument, but I also see the argument that hunters would use in that situation that if you limit the amount of rounds that a guy can have in his gun or the ability to fire off round quickly, you're limiting their ability to make a quick followup shot on an animal that would kill that animal.

Speaker 2:          00:49:06       Yeah. And so if you have somebody that's that dedicated, right, I don't have a problem with that personally. So if you have somebody that we want to establish this high standard, so say say we have the super high standard where this guy, he can get his big gun that he uses in his well trained on and he's gone through a super long process of backgrounds and he's all checked out that I don't have any objection to that. But like say his gun gets stolen, you don't get it anymore, you're done. Right. So you have to maintain this high standard in order to have such extreme privilege. And I'm fine with that. Like people that have c, four explosives, you know, there are people that can legally carry det cord and c four to blow up buildings. They're not a big problem to the rest of the society using their debt court and see for, to, to hurt people.

Speaker 2:          00:49:54       So if that's a unique class of individual. Yeah, I see what you're saying. So you think that should be more stringent testing and background checks on people that are getting guns? Yeah. Especially those kind of high powered ones or handguns, we, we, we get caught up a lot in the high power because they're, they're capable of that mass destruction, but it's the handguns that caused the fear in society every single day because it's so easy to conceal. Yeah, that's the whole problem is the concealment that you can just pop it out and use it. You don't know who has what and so everyone becomes a. because you have

Speaker 4:          00:50:27       this small death device on you that anybody can do anything and it's just like we gotta go back to that equation, like what is on the other side of the equation of 30,000 handguns and $300 plus a mass shootings per year. The other side of that equation is, is that ridiculous idea. I mean, if you can figure out something for me other than I liked collecting guns and I think they're cool and it's my right then, then I'm willing to hear it. I just don't hear an argument beyond that. Well, the only argument is that a person who is not a criminal and a person who doesn't have any ill will in their hearts and just enjoys firearm, should be able to have them just like you should be able to have a truck that you could just drive through a fucking crowd of people with if you want it to yet, but so the argument there that you can have the truck and the truck is capable of of harm, so just like a knife, but a knife has a drilling and other uses.

Speaker 4:          00:51:23       So on that other side of that equation, when you can say, well, what do we need a knife for? Well, it's to chop up food. It's to skin a deer. It's to do a thousand other things that the ar or something like that. It's for one purpose and one purpose only and that's to kill a human being. Well, that was what it was designed for, but people use them for hunting. They have a better rifle to used in that for hunting. Well, the thing about hunting with those is that you can pull the trigger many times like for hog hunting and things like that. There are a lot of people actually prefer them. Sure. So let's say you even want to do that again, we're talking about that higher class person and so higher-class hog hunter. Yeah, higher class. I'm pretty sure that's not an actual effect.

Speaker 4:          00:52:05       I'm like, so you want to go shoot it and you want to shoot those, those animals, right? Go check it out from your parks and rec and go use it. Check out. Yeah, check it out. You said you just want to use it right? But what do you mean? But check it out. Right? So say you could start at an armory armory that who runs the government to run. Of course. Good Lord. It could be the private, the private rifle range. Okay. Alright. Well that's how it is in a lot of places in Europe when you know how to do this shit. We literally, other countries have done this. Australia is the shining example. They had one mass shooting said, fuck this, and I have none sense. Right, but you can get a rifle in Australia. Okay, and this is something that gets bandied about many times, so I actually had to do some research.

Speaker 4:          00:52:50       It's not impossible to get rifles for hunting in Australia. You could super hard. It's difficult, but Australia also has less people than California and an enormous chunk of land yet. But we have other countries take China. China's four times. Our population doesn't. It doesn't even hit the radar screen when the amount of people they have imprisoned or the amount of violence they have. That's true. But China is. Well was until really recently, it's a communist dictatorship that was run with an iron fist. I mean, think about Tiananmen and what happens when people rebel against the government there. It's two completely different sort of culture. Is it? Is it different than what happens here though? Really though, I mean if you stand up against the government was going to happen to you. It's not just standing up against the government. I mean they, the people, they don't have much power over there too.

Speaker 4:          00:53:43       We live in an oligarchy, like we've proven that. That's another thing we've proven, so princeton did a study where they tracked 19,000 cases of laws that were going on and going through congress, so what they found out is that public opinion on whether a law gets passed or not. For instance, gun control, which over 80 percent of NRA members agree with increased gun control and background checks and things like that. We don't get it passed congress at all. It doesn't have any bearing on public opinion, doesn't have any bearing on whether a law gets passed, but if you have donors that care about a law getting passed, then it's going to get past. And even when public sentiment is completely against the law being passed. If the public, if the donors want the law passed, they still have a 30 percent chance of getting the law passed.

Speaker 4:          00:54:30       I think what the NRA is trying to do is they're trying to prevent the slippery slope. They're trying to establish laws and keep them in place so that established rights that are already in place, right? Keep them in place because they worry that if you start increasing background checks, if you start ramping up any sort of restrictions on gun owners, that it's a slippery slope that will. They'll never get back. They'll never get the freedom back. But what I mean, I don't know what that freedom is. We're all afraid to go somewhere. We don't have freedom in this gun saturated country where we're not. We'll hold on. No, we're not. No, we're not. We're not. I don't think people are afraid. No, I don't. I don't think people are generally afraid of fighting to keep the gun, but hold on. You're saying we're all afraid as if every day when you go to the movies, you're worried about a mass shooting every day when you go to the wall and we're not afraid.

Speaker 4:          00:55:18       We travel freely. Occasionally things like this happen and they're horrific and terrifying, but people aren't generally afraid. We're all afraid to do things. I just don't think that's true. I Dunno. So why then would we all want to protect this so much? Well, the NRAS position, the NRAS position is that Liberals, Democrats, whatever they want to take away your right to own a gun, the NRA does not want that. So they spend all their money, they do other lobbying, they do everything they can to stop any new restrictions from passing and to stop anyone who is trying to take away guns. Right? So, so the way you framed that is that they are trying to protect their rights and they want to preserve this thing, but I just don't see it that way. A lot of people with those people that are fighting against guns like so. So me, I have guns. I like shooting, I enjoy it. I'm fucking good at it. I made a career out of it, right? But

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       at one point in time I did enough research and enough understanding that my ultimate goal is that we have a safer society and that we protect people. But the way we protect people empirically is to not have these guns. Nobody has the gun crime that we have. Nobody in the entire world as a developed country has the gun crime and incarceration rate in everything that we do. We are the worst example in the in the developed world of how to do this. Every other example is a better example than what we do, but we're continually trying to stay into into this same mold that we know is failing. I want to protect people and the evidence says that in order to protect people, we can't have handguns and assault rifles there. I said the damn assault right forward again, but we can't have a semiautomatic rifles out there like crazy that enables society to have that risk.

Speaker 2:          00:57:19       I mean those, those on the other end of that stray bullet is a nine year old girl who's bleeding out to death in the city and I just. I don't want to get rude with people, but the idea that you want to go fucking shoot something, I just don't give a shit about that. When you see the destruction close to you is suddenly Gabby Gifford can go for, for gun control after it touches, you know, or somebody like that. Whenever it touches you, suddenly we start to care if, if right now a masked gunman comes and starts shooting up the rest of this building and they, they killed Jamie, we're all going to care a hell of a lot more by Jamie. How come you don't? Because I didn't want to die that Jamie under the bus please nobody. Shoot Jamie. And I think, I think we would all take a slightly different perspective.

Speaker 2:          00:58:09       I think you're right. And I think that's an issue with all sorts of crimes. And uh, that's also an issue with poverty and bad communities is that it's not touching. The people that are, that are just want to be safe. Lock those people up, get them off the street. They're in my way. I think you're right in that regard. I mean, I don't know if there is a perfect answer to getting rid of 300 million guns are controlled. Don't think you can do it in guns. I just want stop making them. Yeah. Like let's just stop making them. So one of my ideas, they are gun companies. They're making a doctor. They're making, making a weapon of death. I don't care about what they want. So we know guns can last hundreds of years if you take care of them. Right? So if we stop making them, their value will all go up and then we're going to concentrate it.

Speaker 2:          00:58:54       And I know the Libertarians would be like, oh my God, all the rich people are gonna. Hold the guns. I get it. Whatever. They're not going to use them. We know that. So let's make it more valuable so they're not worth $200 on the street so that, uh, you know, a gun of disrespect before a drug war, beef can lead to that shooting. I want to have you sit down with someone who's a gun proponent. Good luck. What do you mean? Good Lord, I've been here for a year. Doing this day in and day out, challenging everyone from Sam Harris

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       to whoever. They're not going to. They're not going to do this. The evidence is on my side. They're not going to do what? You're not going to have a debate because it certainly would. I could definitely set that, set it up. Okay, well I can up my friend Justin. Okay, 100 percent you can get to do this please because he needs to give me that push back that other people need to hear and if he's right on a position I will absolutely change. Okay, well we're definitely going to set that up then I'm going to bring in Justin because Justin is very articulate and don't be intimidated because he has a giant, does have a thousand fucking guns or something like that. But he's a nice guy. He's a very nice guy. He's a good buddy. Um, and he is a, like I said, and firearms enthusiast, but also a really nice guy that has no criminal record, never done anything wrong and very articulate.

Speaker 4:          01:00:04       Very smart, very well read. But he's going to say that people like him should have the guns. Right. And he's, he's right where he is, right? Yeah. I mean he's never done anything with those guys and he's the wrong fucking dude to break into his house every once in a while you're going to need a dude like him to kick down the door, right? Yeah. Okay. We know that, so I wouldn't argue if he's going to say he needs, you know, we need this elite members of society that Swat teams or something like that that can handle these situations. Of course we do. Well he's a competitive shooter. Does contest and stuff. They should shoot like me. Well, I'm sure he's right. Like if they can handle it and their professionalism as him, you're not going to get pushed back from society because nothing's going to happen.

Speaker 4:          01:00:41       But it's what I'm saying is that he's not doing anything wrong and it's something he enjoys. Like when do we decide, and I'm just putting this out there. I'm not taking a stance because I don't understand it myself. Uh, and you know, people saying that I'm anti-gun or pro gun or not. I'm pretty neutral on this. I also owned guns, but I see the problems. I definitely see when something like this happens in Orlando and some crazy fuck can go in and just shoot up a nightclub and kill all these people. We've got a real problem. I don't know how to solve that problem. I'm sure some people would say concealed carry permits, so all these people in the nightclubs could shoot out that guy, but that's false. It's empirically false gunfight in a nightclub and more people are going to get shot. Well not only that, most of the people that get involved in these gunfights it will be their first gunfight, so you're going to fuck it.

Speaker 4:          01:01:34       Shit your pants. You're going to get target panic. You're going to miss, you're going to hit people. It's going to be a lot going on. Glad you're saying that. Yeah. I mean it's not as simple as via to gun. If he had a gun, you'd probably wouldn't be able to point it at people and if you pulled the trigger, you'd be lucky if you hit someone right in front of you. So where. Where was that shooting? It was relatively recent. It was out of college and there were two Marines on base on the college campus with weapons and they didn't engage because they said, hey look, I was only going to make the situation worse. The cops weren't going to know who I am if I had my weapon out, but I could have missed and done something else. And two guys that were in their actual right state of mind that we're armed decided that engaging was more dangerous and it's actually empirically more that if you engage, your more likely to die and you're something, you're going to shoot somebody else or the situation's not going to be resolved.

Speaker 4:          01:02:28       We, we, we literally know this. People have done this. They've done studies where they've tried to take people and simulate it and it never pans out. Yeah. But that's engaging with, uh, an instance where you're not involved. If you are involved, you absolutely have to engage. You're going to get shot. Like if you're, if you have to run like so. All the evidence says that if you run, that's your best bet for safety. And like, we don't want to do that, right? Because that's a bitch move. Please. I'm done. Someone shooting, I'm all better hero. There's this delusion of Hiroshima. You know that somebody is going to save the day. And sure, you may find that happen every so often. It's, wait a minute, have you not seen Sylvester stallone movies? Because it happens all the time. Is that that is a problem, right? Super problem that they shoot people in the leg while they're running and Tulsa.

Speaker 4:          01:03:19       Like we've developed this sort of idea of what goes down in a gunfight based on fiction not based on reality. The amount of people that have actually been exposed to a bullet hitting a live thing is so small sound. Yeah. Oh yeah. They don't realize how loud that is. If you show shoot with, with headphones in your whole life, go ahead and start clacking off 15 rounds with without ear protection on your. You'll be ringing. You can't even understand what's going on. You have to be well trained in that environment and understand like cops aren't even in there the first time they get a real gun battle because they shoot with earfold earplugs in and everything. The first time they're shooting their gun, they're hearing the sound and everything else. So yeah, I mean you got those people like everybody that I was in the Marine Corps with doing fast team, I don't think they're going to get any gun crimes and I think they can handle situations, but these are a certain segment that needs to live up to a high standard.

Speaker 4:          01:04:14       Well not only that, those are people that have been trained and they've. They've developed this understanding of firearms that's so deep. Most people just don't get to that. It's like the average person watches a UFC fight and thinks they can kick someone's ass and then if you fought against a train martial artists, you're fucked. Like you really don't know what you're doing. That's kind of the same thing. And when you compare someone who really, like my friend Justin really understands firearms versus the average person who goes and buys a gun and thinks, well, I'm safe now. I got this gun. It maybe, maybe, maybe, but statistics say that you're more likely to shoot a family member and an in a fight or yeah, suicide. Which, you know the other thing, a lot of people. That's a wonderful analogy. I love that you did that because I mean it's a perfect analogy almost for mma and who can handle a weapon as well, but what's all about undue confidence, you know, and perfect. So like here's, here's the thing, I've always wanted to tell people that feel that way. We can. I can tell you, you can have a gun on you right now and we can set this up in the morning and I can tell you, walk around your day as normal at some point in time today, I'm going to take that gun away from you, right? I will get that gun. It's going to happen because you, you're not going to be able to protect it and you know I'm coming.

Speaker 4:          01:05:34       So then why are you actually think you're safe, that you have that gun on you. You're just, as long as you're fighting against the inferior opponent or you're in this situation where you have distance and you have all these things like that, just like in an MMA fight, it's not going to go as you planned it, I promise. So what are you saying? Look, as far as like you're going to take the gun away from him. Let's say you wanted to have a concealed weapon on you. Right? And so you're standing in line at the bank. You're going about your day as normal. I could tell you at some point in time I'm going to get that gun from you and I'll get it because if everything's about surprise. So when the bank robber comes in, well it's not surprised if you tell them you're going to get it.

Speaker 4:          01:06:10       Well sure. I've just given you 24 hours, I'll be all fucking jacked up on adderall for 24 hours. Thinking about the life you're meant to keep that gun safe, you definitely wouldn't be. Well it makes it an adventure. Wait, but that's the thing that you're bigger than me. You can be ready for it. It's still. I'm sorry. You're just not going to be because it's just going to come out of nowhere. So when people have these guns, are you like really good at disarming people or something? No, more than anybody else would be. If you learn how to a holster works. Somebody goes from my gun, I'm punching him in their fucking face. Come from behind you. We're going to be standing in line at a w. where's my gun? When your head right here. So they're going to come from behind. They're going to grab it.

Speaker 4:          01:06:46       Sure you can do. But how hard is it to get a gun out of a holster? There's certain holsters, as long as you know the holster works. It's cake. Oh, okay. What does that one holster wear? If you yank on it? It doesn't work with the triple retention holsters. Yeah. I'm really going to see your gun if you have one of those because those are pretty darn big. What if I'm wearing a puffy coat? Sure. I guess you could figure out ways to get around it. I'm good at that, but you're just not actually safer. I know a dude who keeps several guns on them all the time and two knives. He's got a knife in his boot. He keeps several guns on them all the time. He's been hitting the head a bunch of times, so it's just. Some people think you just, you can't. You can't think that that's what's going to make you safe. It's your mindset, it's your, it's your awareness of your surroundings. It's your ability to make logical decisions. Okay. But you're talking about a very specific case where someone's trying to take your gun away. Right? But that's the thing is you're in a, you're in a bank. I don't even need a gun because odds are they're going to be one there

Speaker 4:          01:07:42       and that's what we have. So like a big thing of policing is you don't get into like Jujitsu Kinda of wrestling matches because of that gun. Right? Because no matter what fight you're in, there's always a gun there. And it's the same thing with non cops, right? You don't want to get in a fight as a cop because if the evidence shows statistically that if they get that gun from you, they're going to use it on you. Right? That's no different from you.

Speaker 4:          01:08:13       If they get that gun from you can use it on you. Right? Right. So why would you want to be in a fight with somebody? Well, that's a wrestling match, right? So you're saying that. But I introduce the gun, you're introducing that potential for you dying and there's a high possibility and you didn't have it before. You literally are making yourself more at risk. I mean the statistics are clear on this that if you bring a gun to this fight, the odds are against you even higher now because most people that bring a, if even if you bring a knife to a fight at a significant portion of those people get the knife taken away from them. It gets used on them. I can't tell you how many cases we've been where you're trying to figure out a stabbing call and come to find out.

Speaker 4:          01:08:54       Know they tried to do the stabbing, but they got that shit taken from them and they got stabbed themselves. So once you introduce that, that potential, you were more dangerous or yourself. But this is again, you're talking about non trained individuals and it sort of brings us back to you and I not the responsibilities. They fight hard on those really trained people. I get that. Yeah, no, that, that's fine. And that's not a right at that point. It's a privilege. So it's like driving a car, driving your car on a right, it's a privilege. So if these people want to earn that privilege, so be it. But it becomes a problem, doesn't it? When a really fucking crazy person earns that privilege. I mean, if someone hasn't done anything yet criminal, I mean there's been several people that have committed mass shootings but didn't do anything before they did that shooting.

Speaker 4:          01:09:42       I mean, yeah. So, so you're still left with those. You still decided as a society that on that side of the equation, you're willing to accept that amount even though it's a lesser amount, you have decided to set that amount and if we can just move to a point where we can accept a lesser amount, that would be wonderful. But we're continually accepting in ever increasing amounts because more people are buying guns, more people buying ammo. Hm. So what is the solution then in your eyes? Well, I would like to stop manufacturing. I would, uh, like handguns and rifles to be banned. And maybe that has to take a long time. Not Rifle. It's just a semiautomatic, meaning you can't own them anymore. No, let's not go. Shit. Yeah, same trick is shit. Then it becomes a privilege. So like the handguns, your twitter accounts getting attacked right now and that was a real fucking liberal.

Speaker 4:          01:10:36       You're never taking my gun. So you have to be those people that earned that privilege. The idea that it's a right. It's just, I think, I think we could call it a lot in that, that it's just even if it, like we were saying earlier, I think the evidence is there that it's actually not. You're right, but if it is like, can we rethink that? I mean, what is the Second Amendment? Read it exactly. Jamie. In its form please. So we can be again, the idea that we keep the constitution and the bill of rights exactly intact some shit that was created hundreds of years ago before any of the variables that we have to deal with in society, whether

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       it's variables about privacy, electronic communications, whether it's variables about the power and the ability that guns have. I mean we're dealing with a totally different world. They made the shit back when people had muskets, we really need to consider that and by the way, they had just gotten done fighting off a totalitarian regime and had expanded and become their own country. Second, I'm in the United States. Constitution reads a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state. The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. See, that's pretty clear. The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Yeah, but a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed if they are a well regulated militia, but it's not saying if it's saying capital letter a, a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of the free state, so they're establishing that it is important that you have a well regulated militia being necessary.

Speaker 5:          01:12:23       Well-Regulated. That's the weird term. Well regulated militia. What does that mean? National Guard? Is that what they're saying though? Because it's saying the right of the people to keep and bear arms right? They will not be in the state though. So the idea that you fight, what is it? People of the state mean they're just people know because that's what the states are mean. We the people that's the country, right? But this is a free, a free state. What that means is they, they're worried that we might be invaded and taken over by England at the government or the government. Any government. It's against the federal government. Right. So that's a state being able to defend itself against the federal government because they still were lingering with that. That from Britain. I don't know if that's what they meant when they said a free state. Is that what they could pull that up again so I can see that please.

Speaker 5:          01:13:10       It's, I mean, look, it's kind of weird arguing about this because if we had to do this over again, I mean this is obviously something that was established as we said a long time ago. If we had to do this over again, if we had established new new amendments or new rights, I don't know how we would rate, but that's a prep propositional phrase, a well regulated militia. That means everything after that is in regards to a well reg and Mr. so if I said and then Joe and everything in that sentence would be about. Joe is a prepositional phrase. I mean that that's exactly what they mean. Well, a rel. Well regulated militia, meaning that there's a bunch of militia meaning regular people, civilians gathering together to form some sort of a makeshift army. Yeah. Being necessary to the security of a free state. Now when they say a free state, this is back when, what were their fucking three states or something like that. When the 13 isn't, should've been 13. Then the first ones were 13, right. The first initial states,

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Sees fucking. Nobody talks like that. You fucks, you know today in 2016 if you wrote a sentence like that, but like, hey bitch, what are you trying to say? You know what I mean? I mean, people, thou shalt not for score in 16 years ago what? Speak Normal Bitch, right? It's, um, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed is the one that everybody claims to. People of the Free State though, is that, that's definitely what they meant because they did that back then. You know, they, they formulated those, those books, but they're saying shall not be infringed the right of the people. But remember, that's the federal government shall not infringe that right against the state. No, it's not saying against the state. It's saying the people to put attack the security of the state, the right of the people to keep in bare arms shall not be infringed the people of this state.

Speaker 4:          01:15:10       Right? But what they're saying is that was annoying for people listening. We got to do the car chase story after this, that we all. Everybody. Oh, that's right, that's right. A well regulated militia being necessary. So there's establishing that. And again, if you're angry right now and you'll fuck I'm writing my congressman, you fucking pussies and try to take my guns. We're just trying to. We're trying to unpack this amendment, a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state. So they're establishing that we need a well regulated militia to make sure that we don't get taken over by tyranny. The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. I don't know man. I mean I'm not a constitutionalist by any stretch of the imagination. Nor am I a scholar of the bill of rights. That seems pretty clear.

Speaker 4:          01:15:56       The right shall not be infringed. Okay. So I'll give you. Let's say we give you the right of the people is what they mean is that the people can hold the arms until they're needed to form this militia. Well that's weird because that is what it sounds like to me to hold the arms. Yeah. So the people, right of the people to keep and bear arms. Right? So they have the guns, right? And so they can have them. It's just that so that they can formulate a well regulated militia later if needed, so it does kind of relate that as well. I don't know about, but you don't think so. No. The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be in front of the people have the guns. Right? What I'm saying. And then the idea could be that they meant that you can have the guns in case you need to formulate the militia to fight tyranny.

Speaker 4:          01:16:42       It could be read that way in case. Yeah. Yeah. Well it's just not giving you any options and saying shall not be infringed. Scroll down. What is it saying? What is the Second Amendment? Actually said the exact same. That was. What is the definition of modern definition of the rights granted by the second amendment. Is there any sort of legal. Nobody's agreed on this thing. Yeah. It seems like these cocksuckers that wrote that chair, they've made it so weird, but even if you can get them, like they certainly weren't talking about Ar fifteens and they weren't envisioning a government with 5,000 nuclear weapons. Right? Then they weren't envisioning 300 million people. The PROZAC, the idea of fighting the government just really seems weird like so what you're saying there. So I was in the Marine Corps. What you're saying then is that if they make a wall like trump gets into office and he says, all right, that's it.

Speaker 4:          01:17:38       We're going to crack down on our people. You think that I'm going to come after you for that. Come on, come on. Like the the most. Some people will. People at our military will not do that. These generals aren't going to do that. They're not going to command their their members. Do you have a military coup? You probably would, but you will have some people that are willing to comply, but you are saying that your friends and brothers and sisters that are in the armed forces are going to turn their guns on their friends and family. Get the fuck out. That's interesting because you could make that same argument about the police. You're saying that your friends and brothers and sisters that are in the police are going to turn their guns on the civilians, so they do. They do, but that's a small amount of people that are affected.

Speaker 4:          01:18:20       So if you're talking about affecting the entire country, then those people will have that personal effect because it's not just there, they're turning on their own family. They're not just turning the same argument that a small amount of noncompliant people would be the ones that the military would have to go against. Yeah, I mean, I guess if you have that kind of scenario, sure. It's Kinda the same. They're literally say they were to come take all the guns and they were going to do it by force. Right. You're also seeing this huge force for one, the military is not allowed to operate on our soil, but they already do. They're already rolling the national guard through cities. And if you look at, well have a well regulated militia. Yeah. Look, I mean when you look at the tanks and some of the, uh, the, the fucking military vehicles that they're using in some of these riot drill militarization of police is a separate, a separate argument. Well, it is a separate argument, but it becomes a military then. I mean, you're talking about war machines, that's something that clearly wasn't envisioned and so I would rather you didn't open up that. It's another channel. Arms Man. Fuck, where's this going? Right? Yeah, this is it. It's a very unusual sort of a debate because I see both sides. I absolutely see both sides. Just remember that equation though. The both sides of that equation where they can be logical. One side of that equation is death.

Speaker 4:          01:19:46       Well, and the other argument would be that protecting yourself against death is a right, but we know that if you want to have a safer society, if you want to live in Australia, you have to get rid of the Goddamn guns. Yeah, but Australia so different than adults. I just don't buy those small. I don't buy that. We buy it this way by it this way. How many mass shootings have there ever been in California besides San Bernardino? Take San Bernardino out of the mix. How many black people in the hood that we don't hear about? Hm, okay. Mass shootings in this country daily, so you're going to get them every week or two weeks in California. Do they really get them every week or two weeks in California? Yeah. You just don't hear about them because you're tall because they happen in Compton. No one gives a shit.

Speaker 4:          01:20:32       Right, and you're. You're talking about people who are criminals shooting other criminals and that's one of the arguments that gun control, anti gun control people use against people that talk about how many people get shot. It's how many people. Like when you look at the numbers of people that get shot in this country, there are also calculating the number of people that are shot by law enforcement officers. Oh sure. They do know they don't even get counted as they don't get reported to the FBI. The Guardian just figured out how many people got shot. The Twenty 15 is the first year we figured out how many people got shot by police in this country. Okay, but it is 2016 and we do calculate, you know, the newspaper does it, the federal government or nobody doesn't look up statistics of how many people are killed by guns every year.

Speaker 4:          01:21:14       They do include bad guys killed by cops. Know what? No. So an argument that Ted nugent is don't count as homicides either. Well, we're not talking about homicides were just talking about the them. It doesn't count. It doesn't count. No, it doesn't count against our homicide count because it's considered justified, justified. Homicides don't count, but deaths, they don't. I don't think they use the word homicide when they're counting firearm deaths. Interesting point. Let's follow that up because this was what a Ted nugent and Piers Morgan, I can't believe I'm using Ted nugent. One appears. Well, he's piece of shit, but he what his argument with Ted Nugent, he got shredded and then argument because he, he went into it on armed with facts and nugent spews this out every point he can, and by the way, he would argue with you all day. Sure. But that's, that's arguing with crazy person. He's allegedly was crazy. A little crazy. That's not go.

Speaker 4:          01:22:06       There are certain people I'm willing to call out from time to time. That'd be one of them. You think Ted knew just crazy is crazy bottom. Have you seen him talk clearly crazy. He's going to argue that until the end of day you can. He's one of those people. You can put the evidence in front of him day in and day out and he'll just move the goal and moved the goalpost and no one's interested in having an argument with somebody who's just going to continually move posts. I don't know about all that. I don't know if he would move the goalposts. Say the one thing that he makes coherent arguments about is in fact against gun control. What do we got there at Jamie? I'm halfway

Speaker 6:          01:22:37       something, but I got this, uh, from the Washington Post, this article that starts with the year of 1000 people nearly being shot by police. That sound as annoying. But, um, it says right here they start to compile a record of every fatal police shooting in the nation as of 20 15 something no government agency had done. It started after Michael Brown shooting. That was when they started looking into it.

Speaker 4:          01:22:59       British newspaper did that Goddamn commies or whatever they are. It's Washington Post, but other posts

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       so sought to compile a record. This is a Washington Post. The Guardian started, but it says the post sought to compile a record of every fatal police shooting in the nation. Two thousand 15 something no government agency had done the project, began after police officers shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in August of 2014, provoking several nights of fire rise, blah, blah, blah. Race remains the most volatile flashpoint in any accounting of police shooting. The black men make up only six percent of the US population. They account for 40 percent of the unarmed men shot to death by police this year. The Post database shows in the majority of cases which police shot and killed a person who had attacked someone with a weapon or brandished a gun. The person who was shot was white.

Speaker 3:          01:23:50       Hmm. Interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:23:54       That's interesting. Why hasn't the majority of cases in which police shot and killed a person who had attacked someone with a weapon or brandished a gun? The person was shot, was white, but a huge disproportionate number three and five of those killed after exhibiting less threatening behavior were black or Hispanic, so meaning they valued the life less of people who are black or Hispanic. They were quicker to shoot them with less threatening behavior than they would with white people regardless, regardless of race and more than a quarter of the cases, the fatal encounter involved officers pursuing someone on foot or by car making chases one of the most common scenarios in the data.

Speaker 3:          01:24:30       Hmm.

Speaker 4:          01:24:32       That's interesting. That's interesting that it's shooting more white people, but I guess there are more white, more white people. It's because there's one percent of the population. It's probably more than that, right? How many of them? White people either see. It's getting down. It's going down slowly. Brown people are fucking their way up to the top. We joke about that. How? What does that movie where everything goes crazy stupid? Come on. Which one? Michael Douglas. No purge. No. Idiocracy, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So like the silly one, we know, we know that the more educated someone is, the less kids they have. So as soon as you do that you go,

Speaker 3:          01:25:12       oh no, fuck.

Speaker 4:          01:25:14       All the smart people don't have kids. Right. And everybody that's poor as poor kids. So like that's why another reason why we have to educate. Yeah, the counter to overpopulation that when they look at the charts and graphs that when you, uh, in industrialized nations, when they become more closer to the first world, they have less children. China. Yeah. But it's also, they're also puck and working more grinding son necessarily. Good. My might be better off being poor with a bunch of kids and be happy. All right. So we know that the most likely time to get to a shooting is in a chase. Yeah. So we owe chase story and we should lighten this up a little bit. Okay. Let's. So this is a story. This is the story that we just got sidetracked from

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       the first conversation. We're in the middle of talking about it. We never got to it. So. All right. We were talking Jamie and I earlier about it would probably be pretty cool. We can probably pull this up on street maps, so let's go to the 1800 block of West Pratt. We can actually look at it. Okay, interesting.

Speaker 5:          01:26:21       Anybody who's got their finger on the send button right now, ready to send an evil email or twitter, but just relax. This is a debate folks. This is a conversation. I know you wish you were here. She could yell at Mike or me. I don't know. You said a pretty a. you've made a couple of points that I didn't even think about that. We're pretty darn liberal. I'm pretty liberal. I'm a fucking confusing motherfucker. If you're trying to pigeonhole me. I'm a. I'm a liberal Hippie who owns guns and hunts and loves weed and gay people. I love. I love everybody.

Speaker 2:          01:26:56       All right. Can we do. Can we go to.

Speaker 5:          01:27:01       Okay, so this is the uh, so go down to that red awning and turn around. First of all, how dope is Google maps? It's crazy where we're traveling through Baltimore right now on Jamie's computers. This is madness. When we see in people's license plates and shit, that's so weird that they can do that. They could just zoom in if caught people coming out of whorehouse yeah, they have. People have sued because the Google cars. Yeah, the Google car drove by right when they're just lighting up a cigarette.

Speaker 2:          01:27:29       All right. Face. They'll left Jamie.

Speaker 5:          01:27:32       Okay. So this is a really dilapidated neighborhood in Baltimore. We don't need to necessarily see it, but we're dealing with dea. A space h o o d.

Speaker 2:          01:27:44       okay. I'm sorry. Go left it. Go down the street a little bit more

Speaker 5:          01:27:52       by the way, since we're talking about Baltimore. Shout out to my brother John. Rollo.

Speaker 2:          01:27:58       Baltimore. Alright. So this is one of my ground control mma. Go there. Learn how to fight. Right? So I'm going to tell the story if I could get my bearings right because it doesn't seem like I'm going to be able to pull it off. It's okay. Alright. So anyway, I'll just tell the story. So one of my favorite times ever, best night ever had as a cop, we were working in major case squad and we had been assigned a new vr. Oh, which is a violent repeat offender target to go after. You're going to hear a lot of these in, a lot of chiefs are starting to push this out again, which is the violent repeat offender where they have people with um, so they, they do like this predictiveness that these are the people that were likely to get shot or likely to do shootings or something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:28:45       So we want to focus all of our enforcement efforts on them to get them on anything. It doesn't work. But regardless, that's what I was doing at the time. And we had a guy set up to the bar and at the bar and we knew that this gang go in and out of this bar. So we had a guy sit in, covert in a van and watch the bar because we, our whole intent was to take pictures, take pictures, document who is going in and try and see some associations. And me and another car. We were hiding away, just waiting to see what he reported. Maybe we could follow somebody, things like that. And we're talking and I spent hours. We're on like our 10 sitting there, nothing going on and we had a secure channel so we could just talk back and forth on our radio and they're talking about sports or something.

Speaker 2:          01:29:35       Had to be soccer, baseball because it was so nice to give a shit about. So everybody's bitching, going back on the radio, just talk and trying to pass the time. And then the guy watching and covert, he goes, finally here and coming here. He said, God, would you shut the fuck up? Shut up. They're robbing the store next to me right now. I'm watching them. I could see that it's a silver 38 into dude's hand robbing the store. Shut the fuck up and get over here. So we're like, alright, alright, alright. So he's calling it out and these guys running, they get into a getaway car and go around the block and we get behind them. So we're following them and they know this is a fresh robbery and so they got hand guns in the car and everything. Do they know you're following? Nope.

Speaker 2:          01:30:15       So we have our cars and we're following behind him and we're in this area where you have the one district to the left, to the west, the southwest. You have the western district in north and the southern till left. So they called the Tri district but we're kind of in this area where communications are going to be weird because these are all different channels. So I'm riding with the sergeant. I was a detective at the time and say to him, uh, I'm going to get on southern channel. You get on a southwest and coordinate that way. We can call this out. So I get on the radio and I'm calling. I'm like, I need a 10:31, uh, on the southern channel and everybody keeps talking. We're trying to follow him. I need a 10:31 on the southern channel. And I'm looking at him like, why the fuck don't they shut up?

Speaker 2:          01:30:58       Like, I don't understand. It's like the 10, 33 fucking asshole, like Oh, okay. So I'll get on radio 10:30 to 10, 31 is to this day three is an emergency. So I get on there and we're, we're calling it out the car going westbound, Lombard and where we're following it and we're coming up to the shopping center. Turns left on Thompson or the cars full of people. It gets to the, goes through the shopping center and it stops at a stop sign, but there's a car in front of it and we're thinking, all right, we're going to have to light it up here. But that car, like it always moves right soon as we hit the lights. You can, you can bet that car is going to move. So we had the lights anyway and the car stops in the front row so they can't get past right.

Speaker 2:          01:31:46       So they all bail out a one run. So there's four people in the car. One goes one way, one goes back the other way, one goes for, one goes behind and I jump out of the car because uh, let's see. Alright. So I leave my radio by accident and I drop it because, let's be honest, I, I see a guy running with a gun out of a car and I'm still like in Jack Rabbit bowed, you know I'm, I'm going on. That's when people shoot people, right? Right. I'm getting him. So I take off without the, without my radio chasing. This dude going behind the shopping center. The sergeant, he forgot to put the car in park so he knows I don't have my radio. He starting to panic about where I'm going. He has to dive back into the car to put it on park so it doesn't hit the suspect's car.

Speaker 2:          01:32:36       And then the non suspect car in front of them, the everybody goes running. I'm chasing behind him and I've got my gun out and I'm running and I'm saying, you know, hey, I'm going to fucking shoot Yo. You better stop now. But I could tell he eat when he's running. He's fucking pure panic. Like I had a moment of empathy for him like you could. He was just like, fuck fuck, fuck, fuck. Running with that gun in his hand. I'm like, Oh, you better drop it, but running some guy comes out of the woods for behind the shopping center. It's a fucking cop from the southwest who heard us on the radio plainclothes cop. So the guy froze the gun and he tries to throw it up onto the roof of the building, but it's pathetically just hits the building and staff at, uh, the guy coming out of the woods.

Speaker 2:          01:33:24       I yelled at him to get him while I run it back, go back and get the gun. You got to get the gun first. Uh, if you're smart because that could end up with somebody else's hands or or whatever. And we'll get him back. And so at that moment, unbeknownst to me, all those districts were like all coordinators, like this moment of serendipity and policing, southern district patrol came up and got one of the guys and like Western patrol, got one of the guys and southwest commander was in the area, was there and that drug unit was there helping me. And we caught every single person, bring them back. We got like four guns. We get everything rolling them over fucking people we were looking for by mere coincidence, half a gag that we were looking for to go into the Bar, robbed the store that was next to our guy in covert and we started our case there which ended up being completely successful because we had this huge jumpstart of just dumb ass luck.

Speaker 2:          01:34:23       That does sound like dumb ass luck because called 10:31 AM, 10:33, forgot to put the car in park. You left your radio behind that. And that's typical, you know, so that's the way it is and that's a situation where you do shoot like people shoot in that situation, but I think people think, I haven't been there. Who you haven't been, you know who they are. They're all over the internet, the twitter trolls and stuff or people who want to get credit to other cops, you know, they think, oh, you're just talking about Baltimore. You've never actually done anything. What did you actually do? And those are the situations where you get into these shootings, right? Where you could have easily shot that guy who was running with a gun and that's what the statistics show happens. A lot of the time that would have dramatically affected me, dramatically affected him and everyone around.

Speaker 2:          01:35:10       But what this kid was doing in the end was being part of a drug deal, trying to do robberies, trying to fucking eat and survive and yet we had those guns. So you have this poverty and you have this fighting for resources and so they chose that to rob the store and to being in these gangs. But if they didn't have those guns, how differently would that have been? Probably quite a bit. Yeah. So. So when you talk about saturation mainly, look in that incident we got lucky. Everything went fine and it had potential to ballpark. Luckily we were all competent in that unit, but sorta thanks. I was the youngest one was the rookie. Cut Me some slack, but you had 30 guns going around in that situation and it's just like, oh, you just don't. Like England doesn't do this. You don't see other countries like this where this all could have just went bonkers because we're trying to respond to a situation in a way go after people and put them in cells because we have this, these guns everywhere, and they're fighting for these resources, but that's where we have to stop and say, well, why are they here?

Speaker 2:          01:36:24       What got us to this point? Instead, what we continue to do is we just throw that group into jail and the very next time it took us like six months to take the whole group down. We've got everybody federally indicted, but as soon as we do that, the next group just steps up because we didn't take a moment to look at the causation. Well, you know, the old argument, if you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns. Right? Well, I mean, that's circular logic to it is, but when you're dealing with a supply that already exists in the hundreds of millions, it's pretty logical actually. Yeah. I mean, it's gonna happen, but you have to go door to door and dig into people's basements. But if you make guns illegal, then uh, then the only people that have guns are law abiding people. What do you mean?

Speaker 2:          01:37:08       No? And completely legal. Completely legal. So that's why what you mean? Yeah. So that's why it's a circular logic. So because those are. The criminals are still criminals. Even if the guns are illegal, it's not everyone's on a law abiding citizen that has a gun. If you give a gun to a criminal, right. But if you don't have the law in place to make it criminal. And that's the thing we're saying, well only bad guys will have guns if we outlaw them. All right, well yeah, because we outlawed them all. I mean that's just, it's circular logic. So if we have the law first, because you're not changing the gun ownership, you're just changing the law. Right? But you're already. We've already made it illegal for people that are felons to possess firearms. Yeah. But when you have that level of saturation, obviously it doesn't work.

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       Right? But it gets back to the same issue. Like how would you ever pass? It's like trying to get, you know, it's like taking a bucket of water and thrown it into the ocean and trying to get that fresh water out. Like how do you get out the guns that are in the stop adding salt so we can't instantly solve it. We just have to stop doing it the wrong way. That's like the drug war. I mean you, you've been into the drug war so you know, without a doubt it doesn't work. But what are we still doing? And like it's, I know we're slowly moving away from that. Sure. I mean we should stop right now. I mean like you can literally just stopped it just as quickly as we started it. We can say okay, we're not going to imprison people for those offenses.

Speaker 4:          01:38:37       If they get into crime and they shoot somebody, well then go after them for the shooting. But what we do is we put that law in there and we make it, you know, with like we're creating this, we know what's wrong and we know to just stop this. So with the guns, you know, if he just stopped manufacturing them, we'll get somewhere if you just stopped locking people up for the drug war were get somewhere and improving that. But we're not. We're just keep doing the scenes. So it's been a year since I was here and we discussed these drug war issues. We haven't really moved the bar much more. The only thing that it is up for ballot and several different states. Marijuana, of course not, not other drugs and slowly but surely it will become legal throughout the United States. Most likely now Washington DC is legal.

Speaker 4:          01:39:26       There's a lot of places that are illegal now that weren't legal before and then it's on the ballot in November in California and several other states. I believe that other states as well. But ca marijuana is just one really benign law. I mean it's really, it's, it's a rather benign substance in many ways. It's not, it's not a dangerous thing. It's not a real threat or harm to society. Guns are way more dangerous. Sure. So moving that, changing that. But we're creating that, you know, so we create the guns are being used because of the drug war. Right. And then we have people that are dying of heroin overdoses because of the drug war and notice we've had a lot of improvements when people were dying of a heroin overdose is now that it's in Massachusetts and stuff. What do you mean? In Massachusetts? Way are like the cops aren't arresting.

Speaker 4:          01:40:16       There's a, there's a chief there that decided he was going to be smart and he wasn't going to lock up the heroin users. He was going to get them into treatment. [inaudible] has had excellent success with the heroin problem. That was a one on one of those cnn shows was detailing what actually went, went down. Oh, it was Anthony Bourdain show. They were talking about how what, what really happened was so many people got addicted to Oxycontin is because of prescription drug companies pushing that shit where people, you know, when people are like little small, minor injuries and they're prescribing pills that are opiates and highly addictive.

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       They're no different than heroin. Yeah. I mean like literally their heroin. Yeah. And so that's money in politics issue. Again, we're not fighting the, those drug dealers who are getting everybody hooked on heroin. We're fighting the drug dealers that are in the city still.

Speaker 1:          01:41:09       Yeah, that's a gigantic issue of course. Um, and then these people, when they started to crack down on Oxycontin's, that is when heroin moved in to take its place because these people are sick. They needed their pills, they didn't get their pill. So then they got heroin instead

Speaker 2:          01:41:25       rent. Yeah. I don't know, but I mean, so to move onto some reform measures are what's being shown in the last year. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Um, alright. So let's talk about what happened as the years gone on. Um, after I left here, uh, obviously people picked up and I had that, you know, the Joe Rogan effect that they, everybody always talks about after they talked to you, other people started to pay attention. And I went back to Baltimore, um, and his dude sends me an email and it says they arrange it through leap that he's going to come visit me and he wants to talk about a movie. Oh Jesus. And so he calls so they corrupt you, it would get you and we talk about some of these ideas, a very good movie idea that he as trying to kind of put some of these things into an emotional appeal that people can understand and, and comes close to them.

Speaker 2:          01:42:20       But what that did was, is it, it pushed me to get more involved in Baltimore so I could get the other people involved in the project that would have good ideas and would really know the streets well and with know the activism path and what was going on with black lives matter and everything in there. And so I reached out to a bunch of the activists and we started forming these tight knit groups and come to find out this dude doing the movie is matthew costs of Itch. And I don't know if he's going to do it yet or not, but he's like this big star in France. And thinking about doing a sequel to moving me. He may call Lehane, which really talks about these kinds of things in France. France had very similar hyper segregation problems and ghettoization 20 years ago. And ended up having riots and they, they did a lot to fix it and that's what he's kind of doing like a 20 year reunion of that.

Speaker 2:          01:43:14       But getting involved in Baltimore and meeting everybody I really have been like in a school, I'm a of understanding of what the cities need and what people are trying to fight for, what the black lives matter movement really means. Um, I, I just didn't, I had all of those preconceived notions of like, you know, being a white hero kind of thing where you go and you help and like your bringing your skills down and you don't realize the things you're saying and how you play into privilege and things like that. And getting them going in there with them. Uh, my, my walls against Muslims got got torn down because I ended up meeting Muslim activists who were really treat using religion to do the right things, you know, the good things, the selective of course, but getting involved in the movement to the point where we're having these, these groups and we're doing things like, uh, having panel discussions.

Speaker 2:          01:44:21       And we did like a stop and Frisk for people so that they would see what it was like to actually have somebody come up on you and search through your pockets. And we've been doing documentaries, uh, we've been doing protesting where there's a met this lady Twanda Jones, who her brother was killed by Baltimore police officers a couple of years ago and she's been protesting every single Wednesday for two and a half years fighting for her brother, tyrone west and I guess why they do it on Wednesdays. And He, uh, he was beaten to death by Baltimore cops, like literally beaten to death. And we wanted to have things like where we say, why don't we have people protesting good, why is it always got to be like burning down the cvs or something like that. Whereas all the good people and like I was just flabbergasted that they were everywhere in, in, in what everyone thinks is the worst of neighborhoods, was just filled with people trying to do the right thing and trying to fight for justice and doing it in the most peaceful manner.

Speaker 2:          01:45:20       Her brother was beaten to death by cops and what she does is peacefully protest every Wednesday for two and a half years and doesn't get any attention for that when they have other cops that were those same cops beat this guy, Abdul Salaam, uh, in front of his kid doing the exact same kind of aggressive enforcement and it. But it opens up a kind of winded way of going about it is I got to see the other side and that really has affected me. That being a cop, you lock them up and you put them into the cell or are you taking the court and the case goes or whatever. You don't think about what that does on the other end. You never see. And then I got involved in the communities and I saw the other side. I saw what it was like for a guy that came back from being in prison in solitary confinement for three years and having no hopes of of resources like not getting them jobs and having to fight just to get anything because he had that that record you, you get to see that those people you locked up, like they have families who were profoundly affected by everything that happened and they're gone for these years and it's just, it's been a really like I get like aggressive and when we're talking about these conversations about guns and like because those deaths on that other side of that equation, that should became real as compete to me.

Speaker 2:          01:46:43       Like those are people now that I know and I know the families of the people who were on the other side of that and it's really pushing that. That's what we, we, we need to just really. Do you guys stop being these tribal creatures that can only see the, those fellow humans that are right with us, that we associate as being our team. Like we're all that team and we have. We have to start having empathy. For what these things do to other people and we have to see this. Cops don't see what their actions do in order to step up and say, hey, we shouldn't be doing this. We have to get out of this denial bubble and being involved in the city has just given me this huge check on, on all my privileges and everything that we have. We don't understand how much advantages we have in life.

Speaker 2:          01:47:31       It's ridiculous. The amount of factors that people have to fight against that we can't even register. And this is all fairly new to you? Yeah man. I'm like, I saw it evidentially, but to see it in person, like the work that. So the photographer, Devin Allen, pull up, Devin Allen, he. He took a picture of my daughter that's from a protest it's going to be in and he's doing this project now where he took the time magazine cover shoot. So if you ever saw the time magazine during the uprising or it says 19, 68 and it's crossed out and says 2016, because he took that picture as a, as a a young black kid that used to be a drug dealer who picked up a camera as his identity project kind of thing. He didn't know what an identity project was at that time. I didn't know what identity project was at that time, but he picked up the camera and started taking pictures and he got that picture and he's well known now, but what he did was he took that and now he used the publicity from all that and he gets this Devin Allen.

Speaker 2:          01:48:39       He gets all these. He started this project that this community development called Penn north and he collects cameras now for all these kids. Not that he's getting paid. He collects cameras from around the world, brings it in, and now he runs a thing going through in sandtown winchester where Freddie gray was killed. He takes the, takes those kids in and teach them photography and gives them that project so they have something they can grip upon on and they have some they can build up on. What was sad about that is that this is Devin who has no resources. Who is the kid who was a drug dealer who has everything bothering him and he is investing in those communities and trying to provide those things to give people that, that identity where they can climb out of it and they can become. They can see that vision of being a contributing member to society and like that's what we all have to do to give back these neighborhoods. That's part of the way of fixing it is if when people want to help, you literally have to go down there and say, how can I help and do things like that? Because what revealing is that? We

Speaker 4:          01:49:47       all have a skill. His skill is photography, but your skill is is hunting or comedy or talking or however you want to go. You have these skills that you can teach and you can pass on so other people can see an identity. Some people can, so some people can do whatever it is. We all have these skills and that's how we help. If you want to be somebody that helps you cities, you go down there and you help supply that identity. I could just see how many white knights are saying, I'm going down to the hood right now and I'm gonna help gonna just, well, I'm fucked up now pants, but like teeth, so at Penn north we created this thing that, well, they created this thing called the safe zone and what that is, it was all worked out with everybody. You got to treat everybody like humans.

Speaker 4:          01:50:35       They worked out with the with the drug dealers and everything is going on and they participate in keeping this area of the city completely safe so that everybody can come down there and you would. If you go to Baltimore, you want to be a white knight, you come down and bought bottom and reach out to an activist and you want to help. It's not dangerous. You will be fired and there are plenty of people that will help you and guide you through and what you can do to contribute to make our society a more whole place will obviously Baltimore's in another side of the country. There's got to be places around here that, uh, need some sort of a similar matter where you are, they're all the same. All these cities are saying they're facing all the same problems and that has helped me build this reform measures.

Speaker 4:          01:51:18       So my application for Chicago is completely up. If you want to pull up my website, it's Michael Jr net. Let me ask you this. Had you gotten the position in Chicago? You were trying to be the police chief of police in Chicago, right? If you had gotten that position in Chicago, what would you do? What is your idea? I mean, I'm sure you have a grand plan, so it's 38 pages of that on this, but if you could kind of break it down for us. Well, the first thing we have to do is we have to give that power away and I think that's a condition that I have to have in order to take the job. Now I have a friend, uh, who was, uh, actually a driver, Warren Chicago who's a cop and he told me that what's going on in Chicago was that they had some pretty high level drug dealers and gang leaders and then they caught those guys and imprison them and when they imprison them and created a power vacuum and in that power vacuum over the last few years, you're seeing significant ramp up in crime or people try to take over these areas that were under controlled by other people similar to what happens when you see, when we take over countries like Libya creates this power vacuum and now you have a case to almost you say, well, it's worse without Gadhafi than it was with him.

Speaker 4:          01:52:36       That's sort of what this guy was telling me about Chicago. Is that accurate as possible? Um, one of the big problems with policing is we think we

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       can narrow things down and we can find a soul causation, and there just simply isn't any soul causation. There has never sold causation in anything. When you're dealing with a mass amount of human beings, uh, everybody has different reasons. You're not going to be able to do everything perfectly. And those things can happen perfectly plausible that it could have happened. A weird theory that I've started to recognize is that actually in this study, they, Stefanie Deluca study, they talk a lot about how these kids are really more passionate now and they're exposed to more and you can see that their work ethic is actually higher than it was. We think that they're not working, but they're achieving things at three to 400 percent of what their parents achieved. So these kids are ambitious and so if you don't have any other options around, you have a more ambitious population that's now doing drug dealing and taking over territory.

Speaker 2:          01:53:44       What do you mean by they're achieving things three to 400 percent more than their ranks. So you have. So the average in the nineties for, for high school diplomas in college for residents of a neighborhood like sandtown or these east and West Baltimore neighborhoods, worst that you can imagine in your head as far as resources go. They, these kids are actually achieving a. So say their, their parents got 10 percent high school diplomas. These guys are getting 40 percent high school diplomas that our parents were getting a two percent college degrees. These guys are at like 25, 30 percent college degrees. So they're really excelling but they're not achieving because of all these other barriers as you know. Um, so uh, a guy, a black guy with a college degree is slightly less likely to be employed than a white guy with a high school diploma and a criminal record.

Speaker 2:          01:54:44       So even though they're getting these promises that if they play by the rules, then they're get these things at the end, just like poor white American, West Virginia is at. And w what happens though is there were being. They see these examples of with social media or whatever, and they're understanding that if they push hard, that's the told their push hard and achieve these things, then they'll get these rewards, but they're not getting these rewards. They're just not there. So if you have a more ambitious population and they're turning to drug dealing and to crime, well it's just as likely that they're also more ambitious and dedicated to their criminal endeavors as they were to their college achievement. Right. So they're better criminals because they're working hard on schools. Generation improves, right? Yeah. Is there, but there. Is there any improvement in terms of crime rates? Well, I mean there are crime is still dramatically dropping and we are.

Speaker 2:          01:55:39       We live in the safest era in human history right now. We get caught up in a lot of this and that that made sure that's a guy who can say it's a weird argument for the gun guys are they can just say, hey, we are in the safest environment time in history ever, so we have to not get caught up in the fact that, like you said, the odds of things happen, especially compared to the rest of history because of the sheer numbers you're dealing with. Well it would seem like crime, the percentage of people taking crime if probably still are about the same and then or or the amount or the same, but the population has grown so you have a lot, lot less crime percentage wise when you ever have before, but if your criminals are that much better, but there's still gonna be ambitious, but are they that much better?

Speaker 2:          01:56:24       It seems like it's so much easier to catch them doing something now than ever before, other than physically catch them but mean so much easier to know that that's really contrary to evidence. So yeah. I mean homicide clearance rates from the eighties were in 80, 90 percent. Now they're down to 30 to 45 percent. What does that from? I think that's from a breakdown of community relations because we think that comps, comps, comps aren't the answer. The community is always the answer and so if you want to solve a crime, you have to have these good relationships with your communities in order for them to even trust you. Otherwise the streets are just going to handle it themselves, right? If the police don't provide justice will then they will. So if he can't turn to the police, that's another factor you get. There's tons of factors in here and a lot of arguments can be made for what it is, but the conviction rate has dropped dramatically and the homicide clearance rate has dropped dramatically.

Speaker 2:          01:57:18       Police are not solving crimes at the rate they used to. Now when you look at an area like Chicago that has a lot of violence connected to the drug war or to the drug trade, I should say illegal drug selling, it's also resources to those. So the drug trade fulfills in for lack of priests of very good point. And that's a point that doesn't get addressed that often. Right? That's a, that's a very good point. Now, what can be done, what would you have done had you got that position as well? So the first thing I have to do here, here's my model and my fundamental model is, is uh, I think if you had a business and you have a board, you know, yeah, you have your board of trustees or whatever you want to call it. I want to be a civilian leader of the police department, like a CEO and I wouldn't have like officially 49 percent of the power of the agency.

Speaker 2:          01:58:10       And then we have like seven people on this panel who come from the city who live in these neighborhoods. I don't, not sure precisely how we pick them out, can't appoint them because then they just become cronies. Um, we have some issues with voting that we may have to work out the details on, but the, the ultimate principles that we would have, the majority of that board would be from the poorest of the neighborhoods around. So you would create a board and what would, what would be the picking criteria to create this board? Would it be you and other police officers? Would be. This should

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       be the civilians. So it has to be the peons pick the people that are on. Yeah, I think we would have to pick them and stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:58:47       Steve. I think we have to have a vote. This is, I don't have that fault completely outright. Okay. Uh, but the majority has to come from the poor populations covering the base of whatever is good for the weakest among us is good for the strongest among us. And then those boards, while I run the agency, I can only argue to them they have 51 percent of the control. I have all these things I want to argue for. But it's fundamentally not my agency.

Speaker 5:          01:59:12       Okay, so you would almost give most of the control to the rest of the people and they would work with you.

Speaker 2:          01:59:21       Right. So there, I'm the CEO there, the board, they're going to come up with that. We're all going to discuss how we want to approach issues and I'm going to bring my science. I'm going to make my cases as much as I can on the right way to do things. But if they want to do things another way, it's their agency and that's the. That's what I would have been done anywhere. Not that I'm aware of.

Speaker 5:          01:59:41       So your, your idea is so radical and so way out there and that's part of the problem with getting people to accept it. So they would have to take a huge chance and if it failed it would be their failure. Whereas if it fails right now, here's the trick joke.

Speaker 2:          01:59:59       Total cop out in a manner because the failure. Is it my fault? Why? But I'm saying you will be the board's fault because they have the agency so interested. The people are responsible. They can't bitch at the mayor. Right, because they did it. It's their agency. It's my job to serve them. It's not my job to serve a mayor. Right. It's my job to serve them and carry out with. They want to achieve so I will work at achieving with they want to achieve and establishing the milestones and incentives that they think are better for their neighborhood because they may do things which could dramatically have impacts such as hiring like. So right now guys won't hire because they have a drug complaint or something like that. Or they have a prior arrest record. Well, I think if you get all those poor neighborhoods together, they're going to say, look, we know that's bullcrap. The bad arrest doesn't stop you from being a good cop. That's ridiculous. And we can let those people in and they can take that risk as a whole community. We can decide these things.

Speaker 5:          02:00:59       So you're saying make former prisoners or former criminals turned them into police officer?

Speaker 2:          02:01:05       Not that far, but sure. I mean some of them. So the difference between them and me, we know as the color of my skin and in the neighborhood I grew up in, I could have easily had the criminal record that they have. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:01:14       I think pretty much anybody could. Yeah. Right. I mean that's. And that's a hard pill to swallow for folks who have that pull yourself up by your bootstraps mentality, but a lot of who you are and what you are is luck. Yep. Yeah. Everything important in this country. One hundred percent shame. Advantage. Yeah. Being born poor in this country is really way luckier than being born in the middle class and a lot of other countries. So this board that we have, how long do you think is going to take before they end the drug war? It's going to take a day. Yeah, but they can't do that because it's a federal decision. Essentially. You're talking about the city of Chicago, which not even the state of Illinois. We can. You can stop you. The federal government. We don't enforce laws. We don't enforce your law period. Boy. Good luck trying to pull that legal.

Speaker 5:          02:02:02       The feds have to come in and do it themselves. The feds would have to come in and enforce the law. They didn't do it right. They were doing in Colorado for a while. Yeah. They tried. That didn't work out well. Colorado is a perfect example where the money was so good with the plan that was initiated where they're making more money from taxes with marijuana than they ever did with alcohol, which is bananas. Beyond the money. You have a reduction in crime and in juvenile usage of marijuana and in drunk driving. Yes. Yeah. Lowest incidences of drunk driving and more than a decade. It's pretty interesting. It's pretty interesting because it just shows you that it was predictable. Yes. Well, for people like you or I, but not for the people that were arguing against it, they thought it was going to be chaos and hippies and they got to like the town on fire and fuck each other in the streets and everybody thought it was gonna be horrible, but you're talking about a different drug when you're talking about Chicago, you're talking about heroin and you're talking about cocaine.

Speaker 5:          02:02:59       You're talking about methamphetamine, you're talking to them about MTMA. These are different drugs and they have health consequences as well, so the legalization or the prohibition with what they have right now is obviously not working. The real problem would be if they decided to not enforce the drug laws and they decided to in some way, you know, air quotes, legalize these drugs, what would take places? You're going to have some blame be placed on some deaths on your new laws and that's going to be paraded out in front of you. This is your responsible for the death of this young girl. She never tried heroin, but because it was available at seven slash 11 and she started snorting it and then now she's dead. Somebody's going to get that. You're going to get that.

Speaker 2:          02:03:49       That's not the model. The model. So you have prohibition and we were like we were saying earlier, you know what, what prohibition does, it's just the terming that they sell it. Okay. It takes the hands and puts it into the black market. Yes, so well yet heroin is a terrible drug, but what makes heroin so bad is it's lack of purity and the environment in which you will you get it.

Speaker 5:          02:04:13       Well also the addictive properties of it, which is why Oxycontin, even though it's pure and very measurable, still has a terrifying effect. Right, but what kind of consequences did you say that was? He said it was a health consequence. Well, it has a criminal consequences will oxycontin's certainly do. There's a lot of people that get arrested for illegally possessing and selling and distributing. It's a huge issue. Right,

Speaker 4:          02:04:36       right, right. Understand, I mean the drugs period of health issue. Yes. There are not a criminal issue. They're not a prison issue. There are public health issue, so we treat that with health professionals, not with jail cells in and police. So while May, it's not like I'm saying that the drug dealers can go out there and just deal it. That's not what I want. I want a doctor handling everything. I want it moved into just no different than alcohol. Well, the problem with the doctor handling is that's what happened in Florida and what happened in Florida. They developed this environment where they didn't have a database where they, the doctors and the pharmaceutical companies were all in cahoots and they said, look, let's just sell the shit out of this. And the statistics were staggering. There was more prescriptions for Oxycontin's and opiate pain killers in Florida than the rest of the United States combined.

Speaker 4:          02:05:32       I know that is nuts, but what were they doing with it? They were selling it. They were taking it or selling it illegal around the oxycontin express a documentary that showed that these people were bringing it from Florida, upstate into Georgia and Kentucky, but they don't have that market. They wouldn't have that market in Chicago with me. Right. So Florida couldn't do that because you wouldn't have a market to sell it in. So the only reason that that's the only reason take away the market. The only reason that exists is because they can go sell it on the black market. So if you take away the black market as being the distributor then so you would allow people to just sell it? No, no, no. Only doctors. Only doctors for those certain drugs first. So cannabis or something like that. We need to put in a model similar and we have things in Portugal or what Portugal does, they just decriminalize it so they don't put people in prison cells for possessing it.

Speaker 4:          02:06:31       And if you want to still go after the dealers as a half measure, that's a half measure I'd have to swallow that I don't completely believe in, but we can work those things out. Me and you, if you're the panel and I'm the CEO, we can work these things out and come to a position where we're like, okay, let's try this and if you, if you want to go by the incremental ism, then we see that that's okay. Just like in Colorado already has proven that the cannabis model is fine, right? So we can start with the cannabis model and move that in and then we can say, alright, well let's put cocaine into this model and then see how that goes. If you want to be incremental about it, I'm fine with that. The cannabis model, the problem is the innocuous negative effects are just. It's just really the. There's almost nothing. There's so little to fall on that, but we don't make that case with alcohol or tobacco. That's true. But tobacco is not a good one because it's a long, slow death as long as it's. As long as it takes a long time. Yeah, we can accept me. And that's how we at it. It's almost like what

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       we're doing cost. The costs of tobacco is extraordinary on our healthcare system. Oh no doubt about it. Right. And when you think about alcohol, that's the real argument because alcohol is one of the easiest drugs to kill yourself with people. I think there's a staggering number. I think it's like 10,000 people drink themselves to death every year just in this country, which is really pretty shocking and that doesn't count drunk driving, alcohol related violence and all the other things that go along with it. The problem with making heroin or cocaine with decriminalizing it, but then go after going after the dealers is then, well, okay, if these people get hooked on it, where are they going to get it? Then they have to go to a doctor. I mean it's just the way we have to do it, so it is not treatment, but it then becomes exactly like Florida.

Speaker 4:          02:08:26       But remember what we do know. We do know that every million spent when the demand side reduces by 100 kilograms, right? So we have to keep focusing on education. I don't if those people that got hooked on oxy became heroin addicts, if they had the education that this was the path they were going to go, one, you got to believe that a significant percentage of them wouldn't have gone that path. Yeah, I mean now we're all aware of it and I know plenty of people now that the doctor says here's some oxy, and they're like, no, no, no, no, give me something else. What do you do with people that are so fucking dumb? They just want to party. And you got some of those things that a little bit harder, just like you gotta let them drink themselves to death. And what are you gonna do?

Speaker 4:          02:09:05       Ooh, that's a hard pill for people to swallow, but it's better than putting them in a prison cell. Yes, it is. What have you got going on, Jeremy? Drinking too much. Excessive alcohol use lead to approximately 88,000 deaths and two point $5, million years of potential life lost. What does that mean? I guess like you're saying, drunk driving now in the United States, two point 5 million years of people's lives. That's a weird fucking statistic from 2006 to 2010 shortening the lives of those who died by an average of 30 years. Yeah. Okay. So it definitely, okay, that's life lost, meaning you, um, you drink yourself into an early grave, that's a weird thing to argue, but the 88,000 deaths over a period of a four years, that's, that's harsh. But that's what we were saying in. It's essentially a little bit more than what I was saying. We also know the solution to that or a solution to a significant portion of that education, education and legalization of marijuana. Yeah. Empirically know, we know those will improve the situations, but instead we continue to do things we know don't work. Right? So I'm a scientist. I am interested in what works. I'm going to argue for what works and someone else can argue against it, but that's going to be what I continue to argue for. I don't have an emotional position on I, I'm, I'm

Speaker 5:          02:10:33       following the evidence, right? We, we literally know these things. Not only that, there's also a drug that is illegal, that has a significant impact on addiction. It's called Ibogaine and Ibogaine, which is being used in treatment facilities all throughout South America and Mexico with massive positive results, uh, is illegal in this country for no apparent reason. And I've heard that the people that do that are just like, that's it. As soon as they take it to like, I don't want it anymore to carry out. Well, it rewires the way your brain concentrates or the way your brain is affected by these substances. It rewires addiction. I mean, I'm not the one to explain how it works. Aubrey will be in this week and he'll probably be the best person to do it.

Speaker 6:          02:11:18       Got Another one. This is from the Washington Post. This statistic of how many Americans drink every week. So he's going to read that one little thing right here, up to 10 drinks per day up to the top 10 percent of American adults. Twenty $4 million of them consume an average of 74 drinks per week. Or a little more than 10 drinks per day. Holy Shit. Compared to about 30 percent that don't drink at all.

Speaker 5:          02:11:44       Holy Shit. How many of them are doing that? Because cannabis is illegal. Well, I'm sure quite a few, but quite a few, you know, look, there's a lot. Obviously, you know, I'm a marijuana enthusiastic. I love it. I think it's awesome. I want to spark one up right now thinking about it. I'm a big fan, uh, but some people don't like it. They don't like the abrasively introspective properties of cannabis. They don't like the paranoia. They don't like all the vulnerability feelings that you get from it. I liked those. Those are good for me. My personality. I have to type a aggressive, you know, I'm good with a substance, a compound, a that sort of like calms that down and mellows me out. It gives me a different perspective. I enjoy it and I think it's good for people. I really do. I think a lot of the things that people associate with a negative aspect of cannabis to particularly the paranoia.

Speaker 5:          02:12:43       I think that's good. I really do. I do. I think we need to feel more vulnerable. I think more feeling more vulnerable is better for you because it enhances a sense of community and friendship and love and a lot of ways and it it, it bonds people together. I think this idea that you're an individual, that you are a, you know, you were alone, rebel out there kicking ass and taking names. You're doing it all by yourself. That's all eroded instantaneously by cannabis. It just said, no, no, no, no. You're a talking monkey on a spinning ball flying through infinity fuckhead and you're like, ah, I'm fucking scared. I'm going to die some day and I couldn't agree with you more. I think those are really important qualities for our entire race. The human race. I think they. It enhances more community feelings and thoughts and I think that's the opposite of with some drugs like stimulants, do.

Speaker 5:          02:13:37       Stimulants. I've always avoided stimulants. I'm not a fan other than coffee. I've never really tried them, but I've seen their effect on other people and I've read about their effects and it's not what I'm looking for. I don't want to be cocky. I don't. Yeah. I'm trying to fight whatever urges my body and my personality have to sort of lean towards that, but I think that people that get involved with speed, people to get involved with coke, those are people that are like unduly confident. It's A. I think there's a bad drug for society and it's A. It's a drug that is very selfish in its effects like the, the, the, the impact that it has on people's. They become really selfish and nasty and I'm not into that. I think that alcohol for some people is a, is an escape from the reality that they find themselves in and they don't know how to get out and I think education like we were talking about before, allowing people to have access to the stories and the, the, the, the, the, the consequences that other people have experienced from taking that drug will help them.

Speaker 5:          02:14:41       What kept me from doing coke when I was young was having friends that had problems with it and that educated me. I was like, fuck, I don't want to be like that guy. I don't want to have that happen to me. I see what's happening to this person. Some people don't get exposed to that and instead before they know it, they're already in it. They're trying it when they're 15, next thing you know, they like it too much. Next thing you know they're looking forward to doing that because it provides some sort of an escape from the pressure of the consequences of pursuing a dream, of chasing down life or of not having a direction. That's another one. Not having, like you were saying, the the identity that you're focusing on, whether it's this gentleman that was a photographer or someone else that wants to be an athlete or someone else who wants to be an author.

Speaker 5:          02:15:23       Whatever it is, it's one thing that you're chasing. If you don't have that thing, this, this sort of futility of life is very overwhelming to some people and they want to escape that pain. The pain of not knowing what the fuck you're doing and I think some of that I just going to go way out there, but I think some of that goes back to the hunter gatherer genes that we have in our. In our own bodies, I think we're in a lot of ways were a prisoner to the needs of the past and the needs of the past where we were very goal oriented. You have to go out there, you know, to pick the right amount of foods that you could eat. You have to hunt the animals or catch the fish and that was the goal and we were very goal oriented in that way.

Speaker 5:          02:16:07       You had to go out there and do that. You had to work hard and then through those goals you get this feeling of satisfaction when you're just getting food and it's. It comes to you. When your job involves doing something that's not rewarding in any way, shape or form and this is what you have to do to get that food. You've sort of taken out all the natural reward systems that our bodies are designed to sort of gravitate towards and unless you find a passion, unless you find an art or craft or a trade or some sort of a thing that excites you mentally and stimulates your creativity and stimulates your ambition, your left lost. And there's a lot of people that are just left last and unfulfilled and unsatisfied and I think those types of people gravitate towards alcohol and a lot of other drugs as an escape. And that's a part of the problem with society was how we view drugs. We view drugs as an escape rather than an enhancement or rather than a perspective and an enhancer, we, we view them as, oh, this guy's weak. He needs a drug.

Speaker 2:          02:17:12       Yeah. I, I think, I think you're spot on. I don't know how you could argue that, but it, it ties all together. So I know you sound like liberal. I mean you plurally sound like liberal hippies when you like start putting all these things together, but these things really do tie in together so you have the alcoholism because people aren't finding their identities. So we should be doing things. So like help people create identities if we want a safer environment. Right? So it's not about taking those people and put them into prisons as you articulate it. It's about finding that passion or educating them to do something. And, and so if you want to help or police or whoever want to help, you have to be addressing those kinds of issues. And I think so people, one thing we've noticed throughout, throughout human history is that when things are really tough and there's no resources, right, the leaders of the oppressed, like so say it's really easy to use, um, the black segregated neighborhoods right now, you know, it's easy example.

Speaker 2:          02:18:19       Well, it's not just easy as an example. So it's a very good exists. So the masculine members of a society that can't achieve something, they turned to making everything about masculinity and dominance and accepting of the, of that lower realm, and they start to treat, uh, intelligence and education as a feminine or, or weak. And, and so you have that, that, that plays into the culture of where you have the guns and everybody has to know the disrespecting culture. And this is my corner kind of culture. So we have those kinds of benefits that are a factor also in, in leveling the playing field for everybody and contributing. So one of the things that we're doing right now is we're building a studio like this in Baltimore and it's called a radio revolver and that'll be my shameless plug. So go fund me Radio Revolver and we still need a few more thousand dollars to fix everything up. What are you doing? So we are making it. So we have a video recording, like skype session, have the podcasts, the whole setup like this for with eight Mike's. And we're trying to set everything up. We have local artists that are painting everything in the inside.

Speaker 5:          02:19:35       Let me stop right now. A people are going to talk over each other. Never have more than two. Okay? Okay. We've made that mistake many times. We have these fight companions with four and they're my best friends and we're all fucking yelling over each other. I try to watch one of those the other day I was like, Oh my God, I'm getting a headache.

Speaker 2:          02:19:49       Sometimes those are pretty fun. Uh, we get hammered,

Speaker 5:          02:19:54       they're ridiculous. But I'm just saying if you have eight people to really. It's like you ever heard that expression one? Um, one boy, one boys work, two boys, half boys work, meaning that like if you have two young kids together and they're working on something, they're just going to start talking shit and it's not going to get done. And if you have one kid that's digging a hole, he's going to actually get that job done. But if you have like four people, nothing gets done and that, that's really the case.

Speaker 2:          02:20:23       I'm definitely going to write that down. You just ate people's to money. So one of the people that I met was a, if you ever heard serial podcast, Jamie, do you know that? Sure. So, okay, that's it. No, I don't, but I'm aware of it. The first season is about it, not salaried, who was wrongfully imprisoned right now in Maryland and still, right. So his Bentley wrongfully, I think so w. well. So regardless of whether you get a point of whether he did or not, I'm honestly unaware of the case. What, what was he accused of? So, uh, in high school at 17 of murdering his ex girlfriend, a classmate at woodland high high school. Um, the evidence, regardless of whether somebody was to argue about whether he actually did it or not, the evidence is extremely clear that you do not have the evidence to put this individual in jail, period.

Speaker 2:          02:21:08       It's not there. His best friend is the partner with me for radio revolver and we ended up being connected for it because I helped out on that podcast for awhile and you know, we've, we have this community that we formed now, so he's helping me with this and this is an example of how you use your privilege and sensationalism. So I was sensationalized by what I said before, right by the, the cops hitting people and all the things they did and probably what I'm most proud of is that I instantly switched from that sensationalism to how we fix things and what the reform measures are. And we don't even talk about that sensationalism anymore.

Speaker 5:          02:21:46       But don't you think the sensationalism was important because it, it brought you to people.

Speaker 2:          02:21:50       It's critical. Yeah. Right. So the successfulness of turning that around into something productive. Part of that is this radio revolver. So if you have privilege and you have an advantage or something which you have to do is you have to build platforms for other people, build structure so that other people can rise not just for yourself. And the idea behind this is we'll, we'll have the network. So it ended up being turnkey. It's in a room that anybody can come in at anytime and if the community, the community members, we already have them tied in. I think we're, we're going to have a problem with who we cut out versus we're going to let in and we're in creating the entire infrastructure under one umbrella for them to come in and have their voices heard and get their message out there. They can build a podcast, they can build a video like a TV show type of thing and none of this is ever going to cost any of them anything.

Speaker 2:          02:22:42       And if they succeed and we ended up getting to a point where we're in the red, then we just start taking all the profits and distributed out to whoever you know, proportionately has the podcast that does the best or whatever. But the point of that is if you have that, that is gonna enable at least 10 to 20 identity projects so somebody else has to come in and do the other end of that, take whatever you have and do that same kind of thing. If you have money, then we can take the money and we can do something good with that. If you have that skill, then you can come into a place like we're building or a place like penn north and pass that on. That is really what we have to do as an individual level. And if so, I would always love it if people would help me out with radio revolver so we can get that finished. So you're. What you're going to do is

Speaker 5:          02:23:28       put together a podcast and through that podcast you're gonna have people tell their stories. You're going to expose the world to the plight of these inner cities and the positive stories about people rising out of them and your friend, the photographer, and a bunch of other people that you can get exposed to. So I think one of the most important things for a young person is to believe that they can somehow or another be successful. I remember when when I was young, we were poor. I always identified with being a poor person and I never thought that I would be anything other than a poor person because I would see people that were wealthy and they've always felt so different than me. They always felt so anyone who is successful, I shouldn't even just say wealthy, just a normal person like you know, like someone who lives in a normal house with a garage and that you know, like, wow, that's a, that's a person that the America aspires to.

Speaker 5:          02:24:25       They feel different than you if you're from a broken home, if you're from poverty. And in my case obviously was nothing in comparison to the extreme poverty that a lot of people face, but I still remember feeling really insecure and really I'm disconnected from successful people. I think that mindset is a very difficult to overcome. It's very difficult. It's very difficult to believe that you can achieve something. It's very difficult to believe that you can rise from no matter where you are, if you continue to work and you continue to pursue your goals and you can avoid all the pitfalls of the negative aspects of society, you can do better, you can do better and you can feel satisfied in that and to give people these opportunities to see people who have done the very thing that you're aspiring to do is massively beneficial because it gives them sort of a like a little bit of a blueprint.

Speaker 2:          02:25:20       Yeah, I mean and that's exactly the point would say these things. I mean you may as well just be me saying that I, I agree with you completely. I mean it's critically important that we set these up for people and they can do that and they do that now. It just reminds me when you said that, like they come up to my house and like that's like success to them and that's what I am. I'm a dude with a single family home in a garage and not really. Yeah. I don't have any money,

Speaker 5:          02:25:49       but it's honestly all anybody ever really needs and wants. I mean, you can get a giant ass fucking house, but let me tell you something. At the end of the day, it's just your house. You know that. It's just where you live. Is it comfortable? Is it safe? Yeah. That's what everybody really wants. Yeah, definitely. That's really what it's all about and one of the most positive aspects of doing this podcast is running into people that I've met that said, hey man, I've been doing standup comedy for three years now. I'm actually a working comedian. I did it from listening to your podcast. I knew that I could do it because you told me that anybody can do it if you just try that you, I, I used to suck and I tell everybody I always, I was fucking terrible, but you keep chipping away at it and she's listening to your recordings and all that jazz.

Speaker 5:          02:26:31       I've run into a million fucking people that have started doing Jujitsu now. I mean it's. I mean, it's not a million, but it's not countable anymore. I've ran into so many people that, hey man, I just got my purple belt, started listening to you guys. You know, now I'm competing my lifestyle. So much healthier. I eat cleaner, everything's better. My life is just. I used to be depressed. It's so much more positive, so I take great, satisfied. I would say private. It's not the right word. It's a great satisfaction. It feels awesome to talk to people that have looked at this little sort of blueprint that I've laid out and said, look, anybody can do this. You can do this, like whatever patterns that you're following because the people that you're around are in these negative patterns. You don't have to follow those patterns. It's one of the beautiful things about social media and the beautiful things about the internet.

Speaker 5:          02:27:15       As you can kind of choose what you follow. I mean, you could go and just follow negative stuff all day long. You could concentrate on negative bullshit and you could be one of those people who goes on twitter and just bombs on people and Shits on people all day and that's going to be your point of focus, but you're not gonna get any better at anything doing that. You're not going to have a better life. You're not going to feel better. You're not going to be happier. You're not going to spread any, any, anything beneficial, anything positive to anybody, but you can take a choice to not do that and a lot of times you need to see that someone else has done that in order to help you do it.

Speaker 2:          02:27:52       I hope you're inspiring others because you're kind of inspired me right now like thinking about how many identity projects that you lead even though they were maybe not even been obvious to you because you've gone and use this platform to do these things, I think is highly honorable of you that you use this platform so that I can talk about these things about blm black lives matter and about police reform and things like that. That's like the typical like prototype of what what we're talking about you, you were great work, but by doing that,

Speaker 5:          02:28:23       well it's helping me a lot too. Honestly. I mean I think everyone's life is a constant journey. You're, you're. I mean unless you just stay sedentary and you don't go anywhere and you don't take it. Any new data your, your life is all about reevaluating the way you think or evaluating it or enhancing it or adding to it or removing some negative aspects of the way you think and one of the best ways that I've found to do that as exposed myself to interesting people like you or like any of the other people that I've had the pleasure and the opportunity to, to talk to on this podcast. You get this. I mean I've had three hour conversations with 800 fucking will not 800 people, but it's 800 times. And having those kinds of conversations, it forces you to think it forces you to. Like.

Speaker 5:          02:29:12       One of the things that Eddie Wong was saying that really resonated with me is that he likes to write. He writes every day and one of the things that the reasons why he likes to write is it makes him solidify his own thoughts. He thinks about his own thoughts and it really sort of like it. It allows him to really, really kind of examined them and go in depth as to how he really truly feels about something and really get a cleaner perspective instead of just, I think a lot of people, me included, I've been guilty of this in the past. We operate on momentum. We just get a path. You're on it for some whatever reason and then just sort of stuck and you just sort of behave that way and think that way and you don't ever examine it and writing allows you to really pause and look at that. Podcasting does the same and a lot of ways. It allows me to pause and really think about some of the things that I've attached myself to or not attached myself.

Speaker 2:          02:30:06       And it's recorded. We're going to be able to

Speaker 5:          02:30:09       recorded the shits live, right? So it is, whew, it is you, it's you. It's who you are, you know, and all for good or for bad, and you get to see negative aspects of the way you think and the way you talk and then you get to see the repercussions of those and you get to consider like, why did I think that way? Was I just, was it just a knee jerk reaction? Was it just was tired that day? Was I not respecting the medium? Was I not respecting the power of these thoughts and these conversations? Most likely a combination of all those things, but through the personal growth that is a been afforded me by the podcast. It's helped me in as much as it's helped anybody. It's, it's helped me tremendously and having these kinds of conversations with people like you are a giant part of that.

Speaker 2:          02:30:59       Oh thanks. I don't know how to take the stuff that relates to that, but I don't know. I can't. I can't sing your praises enough for having that kind of mentality and being the Alpha male that is vulnerable and lets other people see that it's okay though. Those things are important. Uh, it's okay for, for the tough guys, is that to let their guard down and be introspective and to be people that are willing to help and reach out. It's entirely admirable. I'm like, chunk is another person that I've gotten closer. You've had him on here and say his name. Right. I'm glad that you say right. He, he, he jokes about that. How like people that have known him his whole life, right? It's Jank, right, Jay, right. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:31:43       Well the young Turks with what they've done is they've developed a sort of alternative media platform that's outside of the mainstream media, but it has arguably as much impact when you look at what they've been able to do on youtube and they're one of many, you know, there's a lot of people that are pushing unusual ideas on the internet. Um, the amazing atheist is another one. I've really enjoyed a lot of his stuff lately. Tj is a fucking really bright guy and he puts out some really interesting, well thought out videos. You GotTa pee or something.

Speaker 2:          02:32:16       That was, that was giving them that address. Just talking about we got James Jesus. He's good. I got to go see him this week. Just don't call it chain. So, uh, putting our money where our mouth is. We got locked up this year. You guys got locked up in DC? Arrest it. Have you got the pictures of it? Jack did too. He got arrested. He got arrested together. Do you arrested for, for sitting in, for democracy spring. Is that a serving or protecting? Um, how does that work? Would have been serving.

Speaker 5:          02:32:45       Do you? Um, do you, will you? Yeah. Do you guys get 'em of rec arrest records for that?

Speaker 2:          02:32:51       Okay. So you still get in Canada? I guess Jake does a real legit. I just record so I fought it because it was in DC. Right, because it close to you close to me. I can find it. So they ended up dropping the charges on me. Okay. Um, we had got a phone call that there was no way they were going to put me a chance to speak in a, a record it public forum. What's that? They said they dropped my case. What were you protesting? The get money out of politics. So I'm, we're not people like jake and I are not just talking out of our asses on this, we, we mean it. And so we went and we participated in the march and got arrested in Washington DC. Why did you get arrested for, what was the charge? Like loitering or some bullshit? Uh, I forget how they completely worded it.

Speaker 5:          02:33:43       And so it's because you were protesting in a public area and blocking traffic or something.

Speaker 2:          02:33:49       That's what they said. There was nobody trying to go into or out of the capital and that's where we were. Right. But they wouldn't be able to if they did want to because you guys were away. Oh, okay. Well that's kind of loitering, right? But that does get attention to what you're trying to. The largest mass arrests in DC history. It was like a 200 and some of us that got arrested the first day. Wow. Like 450 overall. Um, so we have, we have some good pictures of it. If Jamie that website's not working. I don't know, it's maywood photography. M a e l w o o d o, that's my phone. I'm sorry. Um, so what were the cops like when they arrested him? They're like, I'm sorry, this is bullshit. We got a restaurant or they're being dicks. Some of them are still being text, unbelievably considering it was a. When you see this crowd, so they were treating you like an actual criminal even though it's pretty obvious you're trying to campaign against something that's something that nobody really thinks is a good thing. Money and politics. The lieutenant said, Hey, I'm glad that you guys are out here doing that. Really, the lieutenant said, Holy Shit, these are capital police. Um, I've sang their praises before, but they don't face a lot. So they hadn't. There's, there's jake.

Speaker 2:          02:35:06       So that's a captain, Ray Lewis. He also was arrested and he wears his uniform, do it. He's a retired Philadelphia, a police officer, and he wore his uniform and he got arrested in his uniform and they took it sign and threw it away and they charged it. Say, what does the sign say? Massive civil scratched out. Disobedience is next. Warning. Massive disobedience is next. What does that mean? Well, because I'm assuming what he means by this, but right now the disobedience is civil, right? So we're protesting. We were doing things like this, but like I'm flabbergasted that the black community in these neighborhoods hasn't really said enough, is enough yet. Like the idea that we, they have children and family members dying in the streets. They're probably scared to get arrested, man. They are. But I just, there's a breaking point that's coming and that's, that's what he's trying to say is.

Speaker 2:          02:36:02       And what I've tried to don't scroll. What's up with the dudes with the nose ring? The fuck's going on there? Oh, he's a, uh, he's an actual, uh, I can't remember tribe he's from and he participates in a lot of these things and what to do with the Musket. Scroll down there. J side. I don't know what that looks like. A musket when I was only seeing the tip of it. What? The tip of the. I thought it was a just a musket tip. Never just a tip. Don't fall. So, uh, I don't know what you're saying. A dollars in. What does that scroll down? Dollars in politics. Grass ranch out, so it's essentially just a bunch of people standing in a place where the government didn't think you should be able to stand. Right. And we kinda keep drawing attention to this money in politics because I really think that's the root. It's the root of everything. We can't end the drug war because of this. We can't move anything forward. We can't do police reform because of this democracy spring. They're calling it. Yeah. That was the one day. Different groups, different days. So it was a whole week long. This was the first day was the biggest day and you'll have me in handcuffs at the end eventually.

Speaker 2:          02:37:10       But. So how long did you have to stay in jail for the night? Oh no annoying. Well it wasn't snoring. It wasn't a real jail. There were so many people that it was just like they were keeping us in like animal pens and felt like a. So we would just be like panned off. Like they I think took us to a different place and had like a, like fences, like portable fences and they will punch you like. So it's not like you really couldn't get out, you could get out if you want it to. I guess I could have if I really wanted to, I wasn't going to go for an escape charge. This is so silly, but seems like so the dumb way to handle it. Everybody's smiling, getting handcuffed as you see. It's a pretty white crowd. Oh, it's fun. So I think that helps on the way the police act.

Speaker 2:          02:37:57       Like some people just psyched to be hanging out with Cenk. Yeah, no. Weird. So that's an example of another thing. I mean you can go and you can participate in these things. So if that is a passion of yours, I think that's another identity thing that we have. You can, you can go and see these groups. There's all these groups out there and like you're saying that these people feel lost and they're turning to two other things. But we have all these things out there and if you don't have one, create one. There are out there like the tyt family, like your family, like black lives matter. We have tons of of movements going on that, that you can do something positive with no matter who you are. Okay. So tell us one more time, what's the name of this podcast and when do you hope this thing's going to start?

Speaker 2:          02:38:43       So name of the podcast or the radio right now it's called, it's called radio revolver. And that's just the umbrella. Why Radio Revolver about guns? Yeah, we finally had that place. So I revolving door, like a prison cell is how I envisioned it. They wanted to use like a gun logo and I was like, no, no, no, no, no, you can't do that radio revolver, podcast network. Right. So here's some of the friends that I've made that are activists around and there's definitely be ones that are in there. We were doing a serial show and we took that picture and so the donating is for equipment and for rental space. The space was donated by sod. It's basement of his house all blocked off and done. So that's not an issue. We have that done. Um, what do you need to. We're still just getting the last bit of equipment.

Speaker 2:          02:39:24       We have some of the local artists painting the walls now. Oh Great. And so we're close. We don't, I mean like maybe $3,000 and I'm a and w we're were set. Well let me know when you guys launch and I will absolutely tweeted out and let everybody be aware of it. The first one is going to. So again, part of the part of the thing that we're going to do is we take advantage of, of me right in the publicity. So the first one is going to be a joint project with undisclosed who is a affiliate with serial story and all and that one's going to be a misconduct which is going to be one of the series we have. So there's gonna be multiple podcasts. Okay. One of them is going to be misconduct and then you'll have like the photography warner, you have a public health one like doc large brown is, is going to do a public health one.

Speaker 2:          02:40:11       So you're essentially building a whole whole station. Okay, great. Right. And so everybody that wants in, you know, as long as you learn what you're doing and everything, you will be able to have your voice heard in whichever manner you want. That's a great idea because you know, this is one of the easiest ways to get a message out and the message that you know, you, you, when you hear someone talk man, and you hear their words and you get to know them through the hours and hours of conversations, you get to know him in a really deep, intimate way. You're assigning example ivy, you walk around and everybody to know you. People hugged me. I don't even know my baby. What's up? Right? So the first one's called misconduct, which is going to be a series and I'm going to do the first one and it's going to be the killing of Freddie Gray.

Speaker 2:          02:40:52       So we're. What we're going to do for that is go through the story. And when we first go through the story, the first episode will start and we start telling what happened. Like, so these cops are in this neighborhood and Freddie gray is in this. And then we go, but wait, why does it look this way? And then so like somebody like doc brown will come in and we're go over through the history of segregation, how the neighborhoods are formed, the way they are, why the cops were all white, why the citizens are all black, and we'll go explain that story and then the next episode I'll start over again, start telling the story and when we hit the next hurdle, which will be something like, well, why are they going after him for the drugs and why are they chasing him? So, so then we're breakdown the history of the laws and why the why that is done the way it is. What policing philosophies of led to this. Until we finish out the entire story and everybody can understand the nuance to what happened behind the murder of Freddie Gray. All right man. Well listen,

Speaker 5:          02:41:51       thank you very much. Appreciate it. And we'll definitely want to do that thing with my friend Justin. Yep. If he's down, we'll have a fucking gun control hoedown down up in this bitch. I'm certainly. We'll definitely promote your podcast as soon as it launches. Radio revolve, revolver, so go to go fund me.com. Forward Slash Radio revolver. Go and contribute and you can follow Michael on twitter. Michael Wood Jr. Is that what it is on twitter? Michael? A wood jr on twitter. Thank you brother. I really appreciate it. Good seeing you again. We'll do it again. Yes, definitely. Thank you folks. We'll be back soon. Bye.

Speaker 3:          02:42:25       Mama. Mama.
