Undies one, which I'm wearing me undies right now, by the way.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       Not that you needed to know, but there's a new. There's a new underwear sponsor. Where's the fucking Mandy's thing? Man, see, that's why I hate when people, when she sends me separate ones. Hold on a second, let me find it. Me. They're the best underwear I've ever had. I can give you one without any, any preparation, but I'll tell you what. I didn't think anything of it. I used to buy cheap underwear. I used to buy underwear and like a package. Those little plastic packages that you get at like Walmart or something like that, just throw it in the cart and keep moving. But when they started sending me these Mondays I was like, what is it just underwear like what's the big deal? Well, this is one big deal. P, the average man doesn't change his underwear more often than every seven years. That's ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:02:49       Like the average male buys a pair of underwear and keep that rotten but filter for seven years. That's terrible. And they're not that comfortable. They, they also that weird hole in the front that no one understands that shit was made during the depression when people didn't understand how to really pay out of your own music. What is that whole? Nobody uses that guy down the hall. Okay. Do you use that whole shut up anyway? Me undies.com is seriously the most comfortable underwear you have ever tried on you. We'll try these on and you will say, oh, they actually wick moisture away from your body. They feel perfect. They don't ride up on you. They pull moisture away from your skin so that your cool all day long. I have them right now. I wear them everyday now. See only underwear I wear. Now, I know it sounds ridiculous, but if you try me undies.com, just give it a shot.

Speaker 1:          00:03:42       Listen to me try it. And uh, you will see that there are underwear that are better than. So like everything else, like someone came along and they figured out, they figured out the better mouse trap. They figured out how to make underwear better. Go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash rogen and get 20 percent off of your first order. That's 20 percent off your first order when you go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash rogen. And you'll even get free shipping in the United States and our friends to the north in Canada. Free shipping up there as well. I guarantee you're going to be happy with them. The best underwear. Seriously I've ever bought. Go to get that 20 percent off. Go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash rogen it. Last but not least, we are brought to you by ting. If you go to Rogan.ting.com, you can save 25 bucks off of any of the new team devices that they sell at tank with.

Speaker 1:          00:04:33       Ting is, it's a mobile site that is a mobile service that uses a sprint backbone and they buy time on the network on the sprint network. So if you are, if you were on Ting, you're actually on the sprint network, but you do it by tings. Rules and tings. Rules will save you money. My, my bill last month was 18 bucks. Excuse me. Now I don't do a lot of phone calls. I mostly text, but that's fucking ridiculous. Cheap. 18 bucks. And I go online all the time with it. A $21 is the average monthly bill per device for 10 customers. Four hundred and $40 is the average annual savings for per device, uh, for a business with one to 20 employees. That's a pretty interesting. What's interesting to me is that companies are starting to. It's actually 11 to 20 employees a business with 11 to 20 employees.

Speaker 1:          00:05:25       Four hundred $40 is the average annual savings. Um, what they've, what they've done is they've figured out a way to make you feel better about your relationship with your cell phone provider. Like for a lot of people sell cell phone providers, just this big company and they have their rules and if you don't, if you go over your cost, you money, if you, you know, there's a bunch of weird shit that goes on. Like if you want to cancel, you have to pay some sort of an early termination fee. Tings removed, all that. No early termination fees, no cancellation fees, just cancel. That's it. If you don't want to be a part of them anymore, you're gone. You don't have contracts, you don't have any of that stuff. You use what you use and that's what you pay for it. You don't have like x amount of minutes per month.

Speaker 1:          00:06:09       It used to be that you would buy a certain amount of minutes a month, like 100 minutes a month, and if you only use 70 of those minutes, you never got credited for those other 30 minutes. So Ting, they did it first. The first way they did it was the credit people. They decided to give people the money back and credit their next bill and then they decided like, why are we charging them for stuff they're not using anyway? What's. Let's just set it up so that we charge people for what they use and in doing so you will most certainly save money and it's the most logical and reasonable way to provide cell phone service. In my opinion. I don't see why anybody would not want to just do it that way. The only reason is it benefits the cell phone providers to charge you a fixed rate.

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       Then when you go over that fixed rate, they hit you with the overage charge and if you go under that fixed rate, it's to their benefit. So 10 cut all that stuff out and they they provide you with an awesome service with a great company using the sprint backbone and they do it completely ethically and I just, I like doing business with them. They're the official cell phone provider for this podcast. The phone that we use when I coordinate guests and make calls and stuff, all that stuff is all through Tang. If you go to Rogan.ting.com, you will save 25 bucks off of any of their devices and they have all the finest android devices in stock. Like the one that I have is the Samsung Galaxy s five, which is pretty awesome and it has a lot of features that like even with the new iphones that are coming out, it doesn't have like it's water resistant, which I don't understand why these people are making electronic devices that aren't water resistant.

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       When they can make ones that are water resistant. It just seems logical. If you go to Rogan.ting.com, you can find all the various devices and if you're a cheap person or frugal or or you just. One of those people that realize is most, most of the time you don't really need the latest and greatest and all this shit. It's just a. it's a fetish and a lot of ways and if you're a Weirdo and you're like flip phones, they have those two. You could buy one of those Samsung, m for hundreds for 72 bucks. You can buy one of the older iphones. You get an iphone four for 100, 12 bucks. You or you can get an iphone five. They have iphone five. Iphone five, s has come in. They have a the galaxy note three, the htc one, m eight, which is an awesome phone as well. Anyway. Rogan.ting.com. Go there. Saved money, be happy. All right. Graham Hancock is here. Why fuck around young Jamie Cube's music.

Speaker 2:          00:08:40       Joe Rogan podcast, my friend Graham Hancock. I'll take these offices. You're not wearing them. Good to see you, buddy. Nice to see you. Joe. Good to be back. Good to see you.

Speaker 1:          00:08:52       Returning from floating. I saw your tweet

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       showed a picture of a look like someone was in space. That's how it felt to me. Now I have to thank you for this because you are the guy who turned me onto floating. I never did it before. You spoke to me about it last year. I was so harassed and so rushed. I never got. I never got a chance to do it. I thought I'd do it when I got back to England. It didn't happen, so I got in touch with your friend crash few weeks before I came out here and he very kindly fitted me in and I think his place is called float lab technologies and they're in the field. They're there in Venice beach, so it's a totally new experience for me. And what made the experience even more surreal and special because I had asked for an appointment fairly late in the day.

Speaker 3:          00:09:34       Was that. I mean he needed more notice. He's constantly booked up. What he could give me was the two rooms, one for myself, one for my wife Santha at midnight at midnight, two nights in a row, and actually there's something about floating at midnight, which I think is really. It's really special. I don't do any floating during the day. Right, right. It's a really good time. It's a really good time to do it. So we went along to Venice beach and park the car and crash came out and took us in. And first of all he showed us his collection of African masks and he has got the most amazing, slightly fearsome collection of African masks up there. There's really incredible. Actually it is a deep guy. He's, he's a, he's a trip thinking about a lot of, a lot of stuff. And I've been, I've spent a lot of time in Africa.

Speaker 3:          00:10:23       I've never seen a collection like that. It's just just amazing dog on, you know, some of the really fascinating peoples and their, and their mass. Then he takes us down. He talks us through what it is. So, you know, you go into this room and in it I've seen in some places they have like a pod where you close, you close a lit of. But that's not what he's got. He's got a bigger room than that. And there's a big full size. Feels like a huge metal safe. Um, if you have trust issues, you know, it's a little bit, you've got to, you're going to close yourself up in a huge metal, safe in the darkness. It takes a little bit, you know, a little bit of courage is, I would say is required to do that at midnight on Venice beach. But we did it.

Speaker 3:          00:11:04       And, and you know, we got in there at certain warnings. You don't want to get the salty water in your eyes. If you do, it's a big distraction. You don't want to get it in your ears because it's got a block. So you wear ear plugs. It doesn't bother me. I just go in with my ears. I don't worry. I would prefer to because because the feeling of being completely deaf was slightly slightly alarming for me. Although I realize a sensory deprivation is part of the deal. Um, and, and uh, so you close the door, there's a towel hanging off the back of the door in case you do get salty water in your eyes. And then you just lie down in this, I guess body temperature, say line solution in which it's in, which is impossible to sink and there you are in the darkness completely without, without sensation, totally by yourself. The first time in

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       a way ever. I mean this is what sometimes we're alone, but to be completely alone in total darkness suspended in that amniotic fluid, that strange say line, say line solution with no sensations coming in, no sounds, no light. It's an extraordinary opportunity to meditate, to reflect, to just drift away into another place and not theirs. The only danger I would say it happened to it, I kept, I find it difficult to shut down my mind. My mind is always running and, and a few times it when I was just wanting to let everything go everyday concerns and worries came back in and started and started annoying me. But most of the time I was able to let go and it felt like I was. I was weightless and I was floating, floating in space. That's why I posted that picture on facebook today because that's what it felt like.

Speaker 3:          00:12:52       And sometimes I didn't know whether I was horizontal or vertical. I felt like I felt sometimes like I was vertically floating vertically. It was a very odd sensation. Um, I wouldn't say that I got into deeply trippy space, but I did have fundamental visions. Patterns. Lights started to, started to generate purple. Purple Strips of light started to appear, which certainly would not there in the, in the darkness with me. And that was, that was interesting. But most of all was just very relaxing, just very relaxing to let go, be completely supported by this soft, gentle water drift, drift away into the realms of the mind. It was, it was a wonderful experience and I felt much better about it the second day. Then I did the first. The first day was some unfamiliarity. The second, the second night last night was just amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:13:45       Yeah, that's what it's all about. It's all about getting used to the experience. And the more you get used to the experience, the easier it is to slip into the deeper and deeper states. Yes, it's the first time. It's very alien, is so odd and is also kind of bump against the sides and you have to crashes. African mosques. Well yeah. You probably shouldn't show you those before you go into total darkness in a meat locker. Exactly. Exactly. But you. Yeah, yeah. The second day, the second day so much better and so much so it's made me think maybe I should get myself a flute thing. Oh, you definitely should. It's huge. I love having one. I love knowing that anytime I want to go in there I could just go in there how they loads and loads of money or are they okay? Yeah, there are loads and loads of money.

Speaker 1:          00:14:28       Thousands and thousands of dollars. Especially the flash ones. The crash ones rather the um, the original one that I got which was a Samadhi tank, I think that was like six or $7,000, but crashes are more like 30. Okay. Because his car. Yeah. It's like it's like buying, it's like buying a car and it's also, it has these incredible filters. It's set up through like he has it set up like the one that I have in my house, I'm the only one that goes in it, but if it's a commercial grade filtration system, like he filters things through ozone. There's all these different various steps that it takes. He's written like an entire, like multi, I don't know how many pages. Probably like 50 or 60 page. A booklet on the necessity for different types of filtration and you know what he. I mean he's an obsessive guy and his obsession with tanks has made.

Speaker 1:          00:15:23       He's. There's a guy in Austin that has some really amazing tanks to that does it a little bit differently. He, he does it through a company that makes boats and his are really excellent too, but crash is like the leader of the pack. He's the master of the game. There was nothing like his stuff when this stuff came out. Now there's guys like the guy in Atlanta in a, in Austin rather that is elevating his. I, I spent some time there and checked out his facility. It's beautiful. He's friends with my friend Aubrey. But the um, what, what crash did was, there was no innovation going on in the United States when it came to float technology. There was like the standard somebody tank, which is really great. I mean, it's cool. You could definitely get a cool experience in it. And then there's some, some, uh, home models that a few people had, but what he did is he just took everything to the next level and made everything, these steel modular boxes that it fits together perfectly.

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       More sound deadening, more insulation, better filtration system, stronger reinforced sides because if somebody wants, would kind of go out on the sides a little bit from the water and sometimes they would rot and like you had to get things replaced. He fixed everything he fixed. There was an issue with the, the linings would burn out sometimes because of the heat pads. He pads with short out it would burn through the linings and then would leak water everywhere. He fixed that by, first of all, by setting like this redundant system. And having to heat pads too, so if one burns out you have a second one ready to go. And then secondly he put these thick pond filters. He doesn't use like the same kind of filters that a lot of people do. Not filters rather liners. His liners are very thick. They're for like Koi ponds.

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       So he's done a lot of innovation. He's really figured out a lot of different things. It's the place to go if you're lucky enough to live in la. Well it's also if you're lucky enough to be able to get in now because now he's booked way in advance. That's what I found. I mean I read it to him. I wrote to him at least four weeks ago and there were just no slots available during the day. He, that's why he gave me the two midnight slot. So that actually I'm really glad he gave me the midnight slot. That's the way to do it late at night. So the way to dentist. And he's opening a new unit in Westwood. Yes. Where there'll be seven. Yeah. That's not enough. No. Even seven's not enough. I mean there's not. There's, you could open up one somewhere that has 50 and that soccer would be filled all day.

Speaker 1:          00:17:45       It will be 20 million people in la, so there's not so many other doing this in La right now. There's a few, you know, um, I think people are starting to become aware of it now and it's growing. Sweet. We'll amazing experience what one question I have and wonder about. What about if you have a joint before you get in or take some psilocybin, what would that do? I don't know what it's like to not do that before you go in and do that. Every soil, not suicide been, but I have, but the um, the pot is, the edibles are the way to go for about an hour before a terrifying supply of edibles. Terrifying dose. Originally. What do I do? And then I get in there. That's what I like to do. Okay. That's what, that's what I'd like to do as well if I hadn't given up many years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:18:36       It makes me very humble. There's something about getting in there. It's just a. and because I've done it so many times, but you know, because I have the tank in my house, I'm super comfortable, I can, I can get relaxed with floating. It's a normal thing to me. So when you're on the edibles to, it just takes you to these really, really, really bizarre places. No moments of paranoia or fear, you're just calm there. I wouldn't say that I'm, I'm pretty good with that though. I mean if I had real problems with paranoia and fear, I wouldn't be able to do everything I do for a living. Sure. You know what I mean? Everything I do this live, you know, everything I do when I do commentary for the UFC that's live. Very Edgy. Yeah. All these things are all live and they're all depend on maintaining your sanity under sometimes pretty intense pressure.

Speaker 1:          00:19:31       But um, so I, I don't, I don't have those, those paranoia or fear issues. But I certainly feel the, the, the, the thoughts, I just don't indulge them and I feel the thoughts, but it's like a lot of ways not indulge them. Yeah. It's like a lot of psychedelic experiences. It's a matter of controlling the mindset. I kind of equate it to just the ability to communicate on the Internet and the ability to access information on the Internet is led us to this weird place where if you want it to, your day could be filled with horror. You could just go everyday to the worst possible websites and see the most horrific videos and the most horrific photographs and see the world in the worst possible light. If you chose to just immerse yourself. You know, just watch the news. I mean, even worse the news.

Speaker 1:          00:20:21       I mean, if you really wanted to really change the way you saw the world when you could live on a beautiful treeline street with the nicest neighbors and you know, the, the cutest little dogs bark in and the life looks beautiful, but through the portal that is the Internet, you can immerse yourself in twisted sadistic minds and, and it's like you have this decision to not do that. And that's in, in, in, in sort of reinforcing that decision and in and um, you know, making those choices. You build up your resistance to doing things that are negative, you build up your resistance to indulging in negative thoughts and in that sense I think it's good, like one of the weirdest things is have you ever seen someone who's never been in any sort of a conflict type situation, but they get thrown into one and they have a panic attack and they hyperventilate and they don't know what to do?

Speaker 1:          00:21:14       It's very weird. I've seen it happen many times and then I've seen other people that are in panic situations or or rather high stress situations a lot and they know how to stay calm and keep cool and I think sometimes your life can depend on it. Sure. Very much so. As a killer scuba diving, which I did a lot of panic. Panic will kill you. I would imagine. I'm terrified of scuba diving. I've never done it, but I would imagine that being a 100 feet down in the ocean where the winds are moving occurrence. Yeah. Banging you against rocks and stuff. That's got to be your lays it down there and you really gone. Yeah. Yeah. That's a. that's a whole nother world. I did some snorkeling recently with dolphins. I was in Hawaii and uh, I actually did it with my four year old to.

Speaker 1:          00:21:59       I took her with me into the water and you know, she had the mask on and everything and she's like looking down and seeing the dolphins swimming under us. It was amazing, really incredibly rewarding. Did they come and scan, you know, they didn't, they just swam underneath us, you know, they really didn't give a shit about us. Really kind of one of those weird looking things up there. They just, you know, it's kind of a, it's an eyeopener, like how little of a shit dolphins care. They don't care about you man, as long as you're not trying to capture them, the more people, whatever. Avoid the boat, you know, they came near the boat. I've, I've been around them though when they're very playful too, like we're fishing once and they were jumping by the boat and being really playful with us. This was a totally different experience.

Speaker 1:          00:22:45       This was, they just pretty much indifferent but so beautiful. Like just being around them, hundreds of dolphins and you're looking at him swimming underneath you. But yeah, I could imagine that panic in that world when something goes wrong, you know, adapt than an occurrence. If you panic, you literally are dad because that's what you have to stay steady and that's, that's the power of the mind. You have to. It's mind over matter. You have to. You have to impose your mind on that, on that, on that situation. Because I don't know why actually if we have all this evolution, why we Pattanaik I would've thought billions of years of evolution would have got rid of that terrible dangerous thinking, but actually it's there though. So necessary. It sharpens your, your reflexes. It's one of the things about fighters is that a fighter going into a fight and not being nervous can be incredibly dangerous. Yes, and when I was competing, there were moments that I was too confident and I went in and I couldn't compete. Right. I didn't,

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       I couldn't. And I also couldn't snap myself out of it. Like there's a level that you achieve when you're really nervous and you're not sure of what the outcome is going to be there. Like our, a level of reaction and of intensity that you achieve when you go into the, into a competition where you're scared, where you perform so much better. Right? Right. And then there's like, when you're super confident, you feel there's something that happens where you're not nervous at all, you can't get up for it. It's a weird thing that happens. So that adrenaline is, I think it's a necessary component. It gives you that extra charge. It's just about managing that and managing very difficult was interesting. I watched a told you a few months ago, I watched this Hixon Gracie, a movie choke choke and that's one of the things that he said quite early on in the movie.

Speaker 4:          00:24:32       He said, actually, he's always afraid. He doesn't say I'm a field person that he says, he says, I'm always afraid. Yeah. And, and yeah, it's managing, it's managing that. What a formidable fighter. That guy, he's an amazing guy to, uh, we had on the podcast recently, him and my friend Eddie Bravo together. It was just a huge treat for me as a martial arts, lifelong martial arts practitioner and fan because he's a real master. Fascinating, fascinating. The guy that documentary. I recommend that to everybody. Even people that don't do martial arts like yourself. You wait, how'd you hear about it? Okay. Well, my son in law, Jason Sarris does mixed martial arts. He does particularly Brazilian Jujitsu at a place called Ama clinic in London and he does it three, four times a week. He's very, very, very devoted to it. And he's, he's been talking me through a lot of these issues over the last year and, uh, I, I get it.

Speaker 4:          00:25:30       I get, I get why he loves it and I think it's been. I think it's been a really great thing for him and I think it's a really, it's a really great thing for him to be. There was a time in my life when I did do a martial art. I did, I quito. Uh, I got to Brown belt, uh, in my very early twenties and then I quit. I'm not quite sure why I traveled. I went away, I lost the practice, and then in my forties I went back to it and I worked my way back up to, to greenbelt. But I. Quito is a different thing from, from this, this real grappling. I mean, this Brazilian Jujitsu, what I see is to, to people who are into locked and they're sent the sensing each other, each other's movements all the time is that you can't, you can't predict what's going to happen next in any, in any way.

Speaker 4:          00:26:13       And, and I understand that it's a kind of meditative thing also that, that if, if you actually start thinking, I imagine because I don't do it, but this is what my son had low tells me. If you start thinking while you're in there in that grapple with that other very strong, very dangerous person, I don't think that's really good. I think you have to not, you have to not be thinking. You have to be acting somehow on muscle memory, on, on, on, on instinct, on experience. You're not really thinking through your next move or are you, I don't know, sometimes you're thinking, but

Speaker 1:          00:26:43       a lot of times you are reacting on, in, uh, in what you try to do is achieve sort of a zen state of flow state and when you're at your best, you're in that flow state where sometimes you'll be in a position where you don't even realize how you achieved the position. You just, you just instinctively did it. And it's instinctive based on thousands of repetitions, many, many hours of mat time. Matt, Matt Time's very important. Matt time being the actual sparring itself because the rolling, the grappling, sparring, you understand like the language of, of human interaction. Like there's a, there's an interaction between a person attacking, a person defending and there's just like this thing that goes on. We kind of figure out, yes, this is something that in daily life, in a modern technological society, most people have no experience. So the tool and they never in a, in a fight situation, never ever having to having to deal with that.

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       So if they suddenly find themselves in a situation of danger attacked on the street, they're not going to have the faintest idea what to do. No, well hopefully that never comes up anywhere else. But the benefits extend outside of that, in my opinion, the benefits are it's, it's, it prepares you for like the drama of regular life pales in comparison to the real drama of training and have of competing inside the gymnasium. Because essentially every time someone does Jujitsu, they're competing. Every time you spar, even if you spar with a very good friend, he's still competing. You know, you get used to this struggle and that's something that most people don't. They don't have in their life. And in, in having that struggle and in this competition, it makes the regular stress that people go through the stress of bills and have relationships and it, it, it alleviates, mitigates a lot of the issues that people have because the life or death struggle.

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       If someone trying to choke you and you battling it out and you're tired, you're exhausted and you've tried to remain calm and catch your breath and defend and trying to stay cool and trying to figure out what's the proper defense for this situation and how to turn this around and how to get back to a better spot. Uh, it's, it's so harrowing and it's so. It's so stressful, but in a good way. So you're totally in the moment. Yes. Oh yeah. Totally. In the moment you're thinking about all the other shit girl you dated when you're in high school where she now you're not thinking about that, you know, the bills you've got to pay or no, no, you're not thinking about any of those things. And in that sense it is very meditative. It alleviates a lot of the stress of life. And then when it's over, you just kind of, you feel very relaxed because you spent all this excess energy that I believe people.

Speaker 1:          00:29:38       I mean, this is not a scientific way of looking at the body, but I think of the human body and a lot of ways as sort of like a battery and a lot of people's batteries are overflowing with Jews because you don't use them. You sit down and sedentary state in front of a computer all day, which is pretty bad for your back and you stare at a screen and you do your work and then you sit in your car or on the train or whatever to get home and then you sit in front of the television. That's. That's a lot of people's lives. Absolutely. That's not normal for a body. The body is supposed to be moving while you're young and alive and why you have energy. You're supposed to be. Your body wants to be involved in activities. Your body wants to go hiking and do things and if he doesn't, it atrophies and shrivels up and it stops being functional and when you can get all that energy out, I'm in a training session.

Speaker 1:          00:30:27       It does a couple things. One, it strengthens your body, so if you ever do have to use it for something, even just something as simple as like picking things up or just strength to help move something you have that, but to you you alleviate all the excess energy, you drain the battery a bit and by draining the battery you put more juice in the battery for the future. Like the battery has like a higher threshold and then you also like, you can deal with stuff easier. Like when I don't train, if I don't exercise, if I don't do some sort of rigorous, rigorous physical exercise, like at least a few days a week, I will react differently to stress. Right. You start getting snappish and. Yeah, well I get more irritated than I should. I affects me more than it should, but when, when I train, like if I train a lot, it's everything is pretty easy. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:31:16       I've seen this effect on my son in law is a couple of years now of doing this. He's been, it's really transformed him. It's really, really great thing and they will benefit from it. I mean, I'm 64 years old. I don't know. I don't think I can go and do that stuff now. I don't know if you found another 64 year old. Yeah. Okay. Or I could work with one with one personal, one personal teacher, you know, to, to, you know, to who would understand my level. I see it. I see huge advantages in doing it. I think it's, I've got more and more interested in it over the last couple of years. It's really fascinating thing. And also tell me about this. I mean, in a way you're being a warrior in there in a way, in a way. It's a warrior thing. I mean, this is a contentious issue.

Speaker 3:          00:31:56       The human race. We've been around it anatomically modern form for the last 200,000 years for a lot of time. Our young men, um, in many societies have been, have been called to warfare in one form or another. I would say that it's gone on long enough for it to be a fundamental part of the human experience actually, um, in our society today, a lot has a lot, has worked to move that aside and probably that's a, that's a very good thing. Although we still do have war of course, but it's done at a distance. Largely it's done. It's not. I mean I'm writing, I'm writing novels about the Spanish conquest of Mexico at the moment I am dealing with, I'm getting inside the heads of warriors and those guys are on the battlefield hand to hand with edged weapons. That kind of experience of battle and warfare doesn't happen. I think much in modern warfare today. It's, you know, it's more that guy remotely part think piloting a drone and shooting people, shooting people from it from a distance, but maybe there is. Maybe there is a warrior need in us which, which can be met in a harmless and positive way on the mat in something like mixed martial arts. That's what I'm coming to. Which you agree with.

Speaker 1:          00:33:20       It's very possible that there's something to that. I think it's very possible that there's something to the idea that we have ingrained in us a certain amount of experiences based on the genetics of all the people that have lived before us and that whatever fight or flight is inside of us, whatever mean throughout history like w. I've been discussing this with friends like how fascinating this time is because throughout history, in the past, if a boat of stranger showed up, it was very dangerous. Yeah. A boat showed up and you're like, Holy Shit, it's gonna. Get crazy. A bunch of men climb off the boat. You gotta hide women and children and now when a boat shows up, it's tourism and everybody gets excited like, oh, we need their money. Come on. Come to this island. Come to this place, bring your family. It's a completely different world that we live in.

Speaker 1:          00:34:09       It is, and those, those experiences that led us to, that led the human race in 2014. These experiences of people pirates showing up and Viking showing up and all those dangerous people showing up in these different places. You know, people coming over the hill on armies coming. That was just a part of being a human being for the longest time for a very long time. Have you seen this new thing that was going on about the, uh, the autopsy of a witch King of England second or we should the third. Yeah. They found his bones, which is really amazing, man. They found his bones like they found it under a, like a parking lot or parking lot. Yeah. Yeah. Crazy man. I don't know. It's him.

Speaker 3:          00:34:53       I think that there's, there's a long tradition regarding him and the battle that he was killed in and there's a famous, these even a shakespeare play where he's at the end of the battle saying famously my horse, my horse, a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse so that he can flee. But it seems that he died in face to face combat was hacked to pieces as far as like one of the last of the, the, the, the kings to die like that too. To die in combat. Yeah, it would. We're in those sort of late 14 hundreds there. I would say I would say so. I mean, combat went on the period I'm writing about fifth, early 15. Hundreds was brutal and bloody brutal and bloody period at man like hernand. Cortez is a leader, but he's a killer. He's a coldblooded. He's a cold killer. I, I

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       think that, that kind of, that kind of experience is Israel today. Does it freak you out when you read stuff about like these these days and realize that that, that all could happen today. We just, we need the wrong set of events to take place to where we're not far removed as a species from that time in terms of the actual history, like gets the blink of an eye between then and now a blink of an eye. We are the same people. Nothing's changed. Um, there's been some, there's been some social changes, but look, we're still slaughtering people on a large scale in large scale levels. It's just that it's just that, that hand tan face to face thing. Technology has intervened a little bit in that. Um, if our society were to go into a radical collapse, people could find themselves facing those contingencies very quickly, very, very, very rapidly.

Speaker 1:          00:36:32       And it is in fact in a radical collapse and other parts of the world. I've been talking, I've been talking about this on stage a lot lately because there's a lot of these. This is duck dynasty guy. That's hilarious. It's duck dynasty, ridiculous American reality show. But one of the main guys on duck dynasty, um, he gave this speech and it's video speech where he was talking about the impending apocalypse and what they call the rapture. We Christians think that Jesus is going to come and he's going to take away everybody that's Christian and bring them to heaven and everybody else is going to be stuck on earth. I believe that is a very elite group. We're going to go 144,000 of them are going to be floated with the idea with the rupture. And he told people that they should watch this Nicholas cage movie that's about to come out and called left behind.

Speaker 1:          00:37:23       That's based on this very famous series of books amongst the Christians have left behind like these these people have. He doesn't use somebody who doesn't get raptured. Is that. Is that the. I guess? Yeah. I don't know. It's so fucking stupid. It's so stupid. It's. It hurts my brain to talk about it, but what's fascinating is that they're all worried about. Everyone's worried about the apocalypse, apocalypse, apocalypse, the end, the end, but the apocalypse, if you go to certain parts of the world, it's there. It's there. It's in Liberia right now. It's in Somalia right now. Right now. Listen, back in the 19 seventies, I lived in Mogadishu. I lived in Somalia. I lived in that, that failed state. It was fine place then back then it was fine. Yeah, it was fine. Why was it fine? I mean, this is not politically correct, but it was run by a dictator and he kept things come. You know, if that has been the case in many unfortunate scenarios. I mean, that's what's argued about Iraq. And, uh, if you look at Iraq before the US invasion, it was largely superior to what it is now, a vastly superior to what it is now. Again, I mean, we're not, you know, kind of not supposed to say these things, but honestly, for the average Iraqi living in Iraq, things were a whole lot better under Hussein. It was peaceful.

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       It was, there were, there was not a lot of interreligious conflict. When was the secular state? It was a secular state. They in fact, quite tolerant and, and all you had to do was not getting the face of Saddam Hussein. That was the simple. That was the simple rule of life. Just don't get in the face of Saddam Hussein. And that was a simple rule of life in Somalia in the 19 seventies. Don't get in the face of Siad Barre. If you do, I'll tell you a story. See [inaudible] Muhammad Siad Barre, who was the president of Somalia when I, when I went there in 1975, um, he, he did a number of interesting things. For example, there's Somali language was not written. This was a nomadic society, 70 percent nomadic. He introduced a written script for this amount of language based on the Latin alphabet. This had not been possible before because religious leaders had said they had to have it in the Arabic script because they were Muslims.

Speaker 4:          00:39:23       He just forced that through. Then he introduced a family law which allowed women to divorce their husbands. At that point, 11 religious leaders, 11 shakes, mobilize the public and said they had to rebel against Siad Barre. Well, what he did, he hold those guys out of the mosque the very same day and shot them all and that was the. That was the end of that argument and suddenly women, women could divorce their husbands and the society was very free and very open. One can't imagine today from the scenes of horror that we see from Mogadishu actually how peaceful it was. So you know, it may be the case that in some, in some situations, and Iraq is definitely another example. You know, we in the West are constantly saying, we must have democracy. Democracy is a great thing. Well, maybe it is a great thing. At a certain point, at a certain level, when you're in a society that's very sectarian, very divided into tribal interests, very divided into different religious groups. Maybe it's actually more comfortable if you have a dictator. Well, there's a power vacuum issue that I think the issue is we civilizations

Speaker 1:          00:40:18       largely operate on momentum and when things have been set up in the way that they have been in Iraq or the way they have been obviously in Somalia where there's one guy who's calling all the shots and they've Kinda got this whole thing established when that guy's not there anymore and then everyone's scrambling to be the new guy. Everyone's scrambling creates chaos, absolute hell, and it creates this intense violence amongst the people like they are our Iraq. The people that are in that civil war state that they're at now where various sections of their population are vying for control of this failed state. It's horrific. It's horrific.

Speaker 4:          00:41:01       You have this hideous death cult called the Islamic state, which may or may not have been initially funded and set setup by the United States of America and it's allies who knows who. Who knows, but it's a death cult and it's just horrible. Give it. Frankly, I would rather have Saddam Hussein a then the Islamic state.

Speaker 1:          00:41:18       Crazy thing to say, right. The one evil is better than the other evil. These obviously we're. We're only talking in objective reality terms here. We're not. We're not saying, hey, it's okay

Speaker 4:          00:41:28       to be addicted. No, not at all. It's evil to be a dictator. Clearly it's the same as a terrible, so evil and wrong and we don't. Ideally we moved to a state where a situation where we have no governments and where people run their own lives and peacefully negotiate with one another, but that isn't the way it's going down in Iraq and it's not the way it's gone down in the southern part of Somalia. Yeah, that would be ideal, right? But it's really hard to run a bunch of people, like the idea of a society. The idea of taking a million people, 500 million people, whatever the number is, and having a group of people that adhere to the best interest of all the folks that are in that society. One of the. Their, their, their needs are so varied, their resources are so varied there.

Speaker 4:          00:42:11       The fortune in what situation they find themselves born into is so very. And then you have the people that are fortunate, sons and daughters that are trying to keep the unfortunate from getting into their gated community of life. So much crazy. And then you can be sure that dictators, sons and daughters are all very well looked after in a dictatorship that always happens. Like sometimes kids like kids, it's, it always the case, you know, that they are. And that then generates feelings of anger and fury that that is, that, that is happening. But a situation where just bullets are flying down the street constantly and you're live. You live in permanent fear of your life. Uh, that's not good either. Yeah. The arguments that United States is funded isis in order to build up support for an invasion of Saudi Arabia or Syria, or rather a really terrifying and more terrifying because I don't want to look into it because I don't want to know.

Speaker 4:          00:43:04       It's a horrible thought. I don't even want to know. I know that that kind of shit has happened before, so when you see that it's happening now, you're like, oh fuck. Is this really going on? Is that really what's causing all this profoundly depressing and the product? The problem is that we can't really believe anything that our political leaders and the west side, I mean they are. They have been proven to be a absolute crooks. Thieves and liars. They lie by instinct all the time and that probably problem with constant lying at the top levels of politics is that it pollutes the debate completely. You suddenly can't believe anything that's said and that leads to suspicion of all of all kinds of horrendous possibilities including the funding and setting in motion of this isis horror and it doesn't help when someone like Julian assange comes along and exposes all these things that a lot of people disagree with and what do they do?

Speaker 4:          00:43:59       They try to get them locked up on some trumped up charges and export them as if they were really trying to export him from, from, you know, to to Sweden and eventually to the United States because of some sexual thing that wasn't even seems so violent. He wasn't even rape. It was consensual. Some weird sexual charge. Like I think they call it surprised sex or something like that. It's not. They're not even calling it rape. Right. There's one thing that like if there was a woman who was saying, Hey Julian Assan, she's a piece of shit. He drugged me, raped me, okay, yeah, send that guy to Sweden, but they're not even saying

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       that if this isn't a charge that makes any sense. And the fact that this guy has been locked up in the embassy in London for all these years, it's crazy. It's crazy. It was a very crazy situation. It's really weird to see, man, it's really weird to see him on television doing these skype interviews and knowing that he's in this embassy and then the moment he steps out of that, they're going to snatch him up. It's like he's just being protected by some weird loophole. Yes. Yeah. Well, you could take, take, take sanctuary in an embassy. At some it's an old. It's an old law. You can't leave, like he's going to have to dig a hole underneath that motherfucker oil out of the street and then pop out of a manhole and a scoop them up in a car and take them to Costa Rica or somewhere where they're gonna honor that we live in a time when they're just that.

Speaker 1:          00:45:19       Just constant conspiracy theories. I mean there's even conspiracy theories about him, you know, he is, that he is part of the problem rather than part of the course. All of that, all of that happens. Nothing is, nothing is believed anymore and that the problem that comes from, uh, the proven fact that our political leaders are actually liars. The upside to us again and again, and, and how can we, how can we trust them? How can we entrust ourselves to them when they, when they behave in that way, what's needed is, is transparency. What's needed is open. Do you think the transparency is going to be an eventuality because of the Internet? I think it is right. I think gets blown wide open. It's very difficult to keep secrets and it also erodes faith in the leadership when like, is this a democracy? Is this a representative government or is it some sort of a weird dictatorship because of it is a democracy.

Speaker 1:          00:46:12       Hello? Fuck, are you keeping that guy locked up? How? How is Julian assange still locked up? Because I need to know. Please tell me what exactly he did that you need to export him to the United States. Oh, he released some information, which is our information to citizens that this is not, you know, information that should be kept secret from a king. It's, it's, it's information that someone who was being paid with tax payer dollars. I did a bunch of shit that the United States doesn't agree with. Everyone was upset by the information that was released. Everyone was upset by that video, that collateral murder video. Everyone was obsessed by this massive amount of data that showed there was a lot of coercion, a lot of lies. A lot, a lot of stuff that we don't agree with and because of that, this guy is like public enemy number one. Yeah, that's, that's so anti what we think of as the United States. Completely contrary to everything in the United States stands for complainant on that. And so in answer to your question, I would say yes, it is some kind of weird dictatorship posturing and posing as a, as a democracy, because for, for democracy to be real, you have to have complete openness of information. People must be told the truth, then they can vote and make decisions on the basis of facts. What we actually

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       have in our society is the continual, very clever massaging and management of information, uh, this so, so it ceases to be democracy. When the voting, when the voting public are fed, lies on the basis of which they make their decisions and vote that, that isn't democracy anymore. That is in a way democracies are the worst kind of dictatorship because they have this appearance of freedom. They have this illusion of freedom. And everybody can say, well, it's great because I live in a, in a democracy, at least if you live in a dictatorship, you know you live in a dictatorship and there are certain parameters that you have to work your way around. But when you live in a dictatorship that is posing as a democracy, it's more complicated and there were a lot of people truly believe and act as if it is a democracy.

Speaker 4:          00:48:19       But at the very top there's fuckery and manipulation and coercion and money and corporate greed and interests and the military industrial complex that it's funding all of these maneuvers and it's people profiting wildly and not to forget all the big corporations, big, big pharmaceutical corporations. All of this about management of management of information that we, that we are given. So what the Internet offers is the opportunity for, for ordinary people who are not part of the power structure and not running a big corporation to take power back to themselves. And that is, that is happening and it's happening in a big way. And it's very disturbing to the powers that be. Yeah, people want like an instant change. But it is almost instant the, the, the, the amount of time that we've actually spent having the Internet has been pretty brief. Nineteen 93 ish forest is when I gave birth yesterday and then like 2014 where we're at now.

Speaker 4:          00:49:16       It's really only been around in this forum for the last decade, like 2004, 2005 and then social media allowing people to exchange information and the heat of political crisis. And they were, they've been able to expose things that are happening in real time that ordinarily would be protected by the media. They would shelter and filter the information. Now it's all just coming out and they can't. So they have to shut down the whole fucking internet and some of these countries which, which uh, which is a very difficult, very difficult thing to do. Now I've seen the huge shift in power that this has. This has introduced. There was a time as a, as just my own, my own small level as an author where I would have depended on the goodwill of the big media in order to get my ideas out there. And since my ideas of sometimes being radical and contradictory to the established order of things, it was very difficult to do that.

Speaker 4:          00:50:09       Well, I don't need the big media anymore. Right? Absolutely. Don't need them. They're not required at all. They're redundant as far as I'm concerned. What does. What is? What is important is the community of likeminded people that I am. I am reaching through social social media through facebook, through my, through my website. Not to say that facebook perfect because facebook is very problematic and is itself a large corporation which is filtering and controlling inflammation, but at least it's there. It's something. There's some excellent things with facebook though. One of the excellent things that everyone is themselves like that is your facebook account. This is when you're posting, this is who you are. For the most part. I mean obviously there's some frauds out there. Sure. There are a lot of. When people are commenting, they're commenting using their facebook indeed identity. Yeah. So like that's a real person as opposed to twitter or a lot of message boards where you getting trolls and lot of assholes that are posting under fake names and they just, there's a lot of people out there that it's like a sport to them to like to be Shittier, to rile people up.

Speaker 4:          00:51:05       Like that always puzzles me that I kind, I come across, I get relatively little of it on my facebook pages. I have an author facebook page, I have a personal facebook page. I run them both parallel at the same stuff in both of them. There's one or two people who kind of haunt me there and just always want to say, just always want to say negative and unpleasant things. And my view is go for it guy. You know, say those things if you want to, but you're always going to get that if you are in the public eye. And the thing to be aware of is that it's a tremendous waste of it. Unless you're actually doing something evil and someone's trying to expose something which you're clearly not. But if you were, then that kind of makes sense, like these people are crusaders, but it, a lot of them are just what, what you call haters in the United States.

Speaker 4:          00:51:45       And the thing about haters is they're all losers. Yes. There's no one that lives a fulfilled, successful life with an awesome family, a great relationship. They're doing what they want to do for a living. They're happy and at peace. And they also go online and a very hateful things and shit on people. You know, they, they're, they're, they're, it's a mess of wasted energy. Yeah. Like they're, you know, and some people are really good at it and it's like damn, if you put that energy into something productive instead of stocking Graham Hancock and fucking with them all day, you could get a lot of shit done. You exactly. Probably be a happier person. Exactly. So the only answer at the receiving end of that is not to feed it. Yeah. No, it's not to nourish it with angry or, or hurting or her responses. Well, that's what they're trying to do.

Speaker 4:          00:52:32       Someone searches shit, you're fucking books. I wipe my ass with your book trying to fuck with you. Absolutely. The answer is the answer is some. Somehow what I try to do sometimes is to just respond with love, you know, just as it's nice if it's true, if it's real and I tried to do the same if I can. Um, sometimes it's really hard. It's hard, but you do also agree. I, I definitely feel this about myself, that some of the, some of the criticism that I've received, even a extreme criticism, even if it's unbalanced, I've benefited from. Oh, is yes. Useful? Yes. It's useful. The, the, the, there's, there's something to learn from that. It's not that that was saying, you know, what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger. I mean, you have to let, you have to learn from this. It's out there. We have to engage in some, in some way with criticism.

Speaker 4:          00:53:21       I've received an enormous amount of criticism from, from my work and for the suggestion that was a lost civilization and the work that I've done on psychedelics and altered states of consciousness. Just endless. It's not, it's nonstop. And My, my view is, thank you, thank you for criticizing me. I appreciate it. If there are holes in what I'm saying, if my argument is weak in a particular area and you're helping me to see that the right response is gratitude to them, they really are in a sense working for you in some way because I mean there's spin unwarranted criticism that you've received that have made me rethink a lot of things I do. Even if it's unwarranted, they've made me rethink like what is the, what is causing this reaction? Like what's. Is there anything that I could have done differently that could have avoided that?

Speaker 4:          00:54:08       Or is this an necessary evil that just comes with the business and it makes you think about things in a more complex way. And although that might be uncomfortable, I think there's some great benefit of it. There's some great benefits from it. And once again it's putting us, it's putting us into a real social social situation. As you say, these people are real, you know, it's like being back in the village in the old days where where you might be directly criticized by one or other of your fellow villages. Well now our villages, the whole world and it crosses all national boundaries and all religious interest. It's. It can be anybody anywhere who who's taking an interest in us and I'm. I'm constantly receiving information, some of it critical, some of it positive through facebook in particular through facebook, which is, which is very helpful to me and I really.

Speaker 4:          00:54:58       I really appreciate it and I tried the best I can. I try as much as I can do. It would be. I don't, I don't want to spend my entire day, morning to night on facebook, but I try to engage with that. I try to respond because I realized that people are giving me that time. Somebody sends me a link to a story I haven't ever seen before. It's really important for my research. Thank you. That's really great. Twitter's giant for that for me. Just absolutely gigantic. I've gotten more information from twitter, more interesting websites that people have sent me to, more interesting articles that people have sent me to. Then any other resources that I've ever been in contact with and it's just directly because of interacting with people and when they send me interesting things, I retweet them and then you know, those retweets gets seen by a large number of people so that people see that I do that and so they send me more interesting.

Speaker 4:          00:55:45       It's really cool in that way. I like that it's like a establishing a network in that sense. It's really a whole new situation which we've not faced before, done on a done on a gigantic scale and and what it means is that information which used to be strictly controlled and in the hands of elites is now changing the power structure of information is changing entirely and that's a very potentially a very exciting new time to live in and great things are coming out of it and it's easy to say this, but I think a new consciousness is dawning in the world. Actually. I don't think it's very big yet. I think the old way of doing things is still extremely strong, but people are waking up to that power and saying, you know, I am not simply a to be pushed around and told what to do by an expert or a government official or a corporation.

Speaker 4:          00:56:42       And that's great. That's great. I, I believe you're correct and I think that it's hard to see while you're in the middle of it. Yeah, because it's all happening while we're, you know, we're participating in it. We are living in a time of extraordinary rapid, unbelievable change and when the history of this time maybe things will settle down, maybe they won't, I don't know, but when the history of this time comes to be written, they'll have to be some perspective on a 200, 300 years from now. It will be seen as one of the most extraordinary moments in the whole human story. Mr My friend Amber Lyon has an interesting way of talking about certain events and one of the things that she talks about when it comes to a corporate control of information and like things on the lines of like the Juliana songs situation.

Speaker 4:          00:57:27       She talks about being on the wrong side of history and I think that's a very good point that they're the people that are trying to suppress inflammation in that way and the information that would directly affect the lives and not just but the consciousness of the entire culture that that's the wrong side of history and all things are said and done. People trying to act in their best interest currently. They don't realize like the fucking Jig is up, man. You might be able to hang on and keep treading water for another three or four years, but the Jig is up. Yeah. It's like the inquisition was on the wrong side of history. You know when it made it made Galileo's say that actually the sun did revolve around the earth even though he knew that the earth moved there. It's clear that the Galileo was on the right side of history.

Speaker 4:          00:58:13       We know that now we've got perspective on it. We can look back with hindsight and and it's the same. It's the same thing that's happening today in different ways. Yeah, it really is. It's just, it's just more. It's more intense because it's happening worldwide and it's all happening at the same time and we're seeing positive and negative repercussions of it. Like these failed states that come about because of Arab spring. Like everybody says, let's get rid of the dictator and then you know, mark, Pandora's box is filled and now Libya is like this and how world hell world. Syria as a helloworld, Iraq's a hell world in every case. Pandora's box has been, has been opened and the immediate result has been the things got way worse than worse than they were before. And then, you know, if we, if we're talking about the dark side, the negative side of things as well, there is this, this horrible problem of bigoted religious fundamentalism which is, which is not confined to the Islamic world by any means.

Speaker 4:          00:59:16       I mean, there are, there are many Christian bigots as well. There's a tendency for people cling on to old and devalued ideas and to have her have an almost religious for fanatical commitment to them and be willing, I mean, what idea is worth killing another fellow human being for because they don't share your idea of. I mean, this is demonic. It's a horrendous, horrendous situation that this happened. I followed a few guys on twitter that are a part of that whole Islamic state. There was an article about this guy who was a rapper who is suspected a rapper from London suspected of being one of the guys that beheaded one of the American journalist. And um, I was following his twitter feed. It's just like his band, his twitter account, but it was, you know, it was just, it was so strange to see what's going on.

Speaker 4:          01:00:07       And also strange to see his. There was this thing that was going on with his interaction with the other, the other people. There was this intense camaraderie, this intense comradery with his other Islamic warriors. You know, that they all looked at it. Everyone was brothers. And sisters and everyone was, you know, it was all great intensity to all of the decisions that were being made and great intensity to the bonds they all had, you know, fighting against what they thought was the evil United States. And unfortunately there was also some things that he said that, you know, they were talking about. Everybody's freaking out that one head got cut off, one body part got cut off of this one guy. But what about the thousands of people that are blown to bits by these drones that no one's talking about? And that's undeniable. That is undeniable, that is a, that is absolutely true.

Speaker 4:          01:01:01       Two wrongs never make a right, so they do not. The fact that the fight that that happens does not excuse the, the cold blooded slicing off of fellow human beings head. But nevertheless it happens. It should not. We should not condemn the one without condemning the other as well. Absolutely. And in fact, the one you know, you're talking about one individual as opposed to thousands of people that have been killed by drones that are innocent but completely innocent people who are so called collateral damage just ripped upon by, by our high tech weapons, you know, which, which, which will be had a person in an, in an instance slice buddy parts off, just completely destroy that if you're lucky, if you're lucky, they only break off a few things and then you have to suffer for the rest of your life and agonizing pain. So we have to own this, we have to take that, we have to accept that this is, this is something we do.

Speaker 4:          01:01:52       We in the West are not innocent of this barbarity. We're also part of it is it we, you know, that's the real thing. Well that's the real thing because then you come back to the question of the manipulation of public opinion by very small interest groups who have, who have a very unbalanced a control of inflammation, right? And then who, what, what is, what is we mean? If it's not you and it's not. I mean, do we take responsibility for people we don't even know, doing things that are under the orders of people we also don't know and under the influence of corporations, we're not really exactly sure who's pulling the strings or how it's getting done or what politicians are moving, what pieces into place and the whole thing is when we take responsibility for standing by and letting bad shit happen and not think about it somehow or other, it didn't fail to fail to act.

Speaker 4:          01:02:40       When when we know that something really wrong is being done in our name, that is. That is as bad as doing it ourselves. Have you ever seen the interview? There's an interview that's out there. One of the guys that say who was a drone pilot and he was responsible for don't know a large number of deaths, but he would describe what it was like to be a drone pilot and what it's like to, you know, to to operate these death machines and fly to the sky and just launched rockets and how crazy it was and this. This is a new thing that didn't exist decades ago. Didn't exist during the first Gulf War. There was no drones. I mean it's this idea of precision attacks by automated machines that fly around the Air Launch Hellfire missiles. I mean, what a fucking crazy name. Call them hell fire. Yeah. Yeah. And, and it becomes like a computer game.

Speaker 4:          01:03:32       Oh No, you're looking at it on a screen and completely detached, completely, completely detached from the Mass Med or that you are in fact inflicting what a dark world we live in. We live in a dark. We live in a dark time and the only, you know, the only thing is that there is this light which is growing. There is, there is the capacity for love human beings. We are, we are capable of love it. It involves detaching ourselves from controlling orders and actually thinking as human beings thinking for ourselves. Very difficult to do. But it is. I think it's happening. I also think that that conflict, the conflict of battling against the negative builds up the positive. Some strange way. I mean the, the antiwar movement was really a big part of what made the hippie movement of the sixties. Like that was a lot of it was in response to the Vietnam War, this war that people knew to be unjust and so this flower power, love, power movement, Lsd and marijuana and all that came out of that.

Speaker 4:          01:04:33       That very resistance to killing people that didn't do anything bad to us, produce this very positive thing, but then of course that was a then a counter reaction to them, which we call the war on drugs, which slapped down on that and shut it. Shut it all down again. I mean, I know you're not big into supernatural issues, but when I look at all of this, I have to say the gnostics who you know too. If I simplify the. The idea gnostic ideas, the knowledge we know about gnostic ideas because a batch of texts were found buried at a place called not commodity and Upper Egypt in the air. The temple of Dendur in Upper Egypt and they'd been married for 1000, 600 years and they were founded in 1945 and they can contain a complete corpus of ideas of people who call themselves the gnostics and they see a dark force at work in the universe which is which is seeking to snuff out the divine spark in humanity and it's a supernatural force and what they say is that the entity who we've been taught for the last 2000 plus years to believe is God.

Speaker 4:          01:05:43       Doesn't the entered the Abraham, the god of Abraham who may be called Yahweh or who may be called Allah, that that from the gnostic point of view, that's not a god at all. That's a. that's a demon. That's a lower level supernatural who's got this huge inflated ego who wants to be praised and worshiped, who's constantly urging his followers onto acts of violence and war. And I think it's. I, I, we cannot say there are any facts in this area. Maybe it's just the dark side of the human psyche and maybe it's all generated by our brains or maybe there is a supernatural realm, but I think it's. I think it's A. I think gnosticism is a very useful tool to look at. The society we live in today, they believed that there were entities called Arkansans who are evil angels who disguise themselves as human beings and mingle with us to drive us into all manner of crimes and behavior that is hostile to the nature of the soul and that's what I see happening everywhere, but they believed fundamentally we are good and that we have this light within us and that that the way to reveal that light is through.

Speaker 4:          01:06:48       It's through knowledge. That's why the serpent in the garden of Eden is the good guy in the gnostic frame of reference. That's very bizarre. The serpent being a good guy. He's the good guy because he's saying to Adam and eve, you have to know the difference between good and evil. You can't just be these thoughtless meet creatures you know who are wandering around in a happy days in the garden. If you're going to grow and develop, you have to make choices between good and evil and it's the tree of knowledge of good and evil that the serpent introduces Adam and Eve to and says you need to eat from that. And, and, and, and, and actually I, I would say this is true. You do need to. We are defined by our choices. It's through our choices that we grow and if we're ignorant of the context, how can we help to grow?

Speaker 4:          01:07:33       Yeah. And this, I mean, the stories of like Adam and eve and the, I mean, all that stuff. It's, it's allegorical, right? I mean, it's supposed to be there. There's, there's an allegory to certainly an allegory. There's. So there's certainly an, an allegory that's real serpent, you know, I don't read it as a real, a real apple. I mean actually for the Gnostics, it very clearly and definitely it was a psychedelic mushroom when the gnostics portray the tree of life and the God that. Sorry, the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden. It is, I'm an eater Mascaro. It's the flag agric. It is, it is. Sometimes there's a Psilocybin, it is a visionary substance, which they were say depicting that in a way from the gnostic point of view

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       is a necessary part of the liberation of the spirit that we. That it. It's, it's an an agent for awakening. That's what the serpent was giving. Now I know that all the fundamentalist Christians out there are going to say hancock is a devil worshiper because he's saying that the serpent is the good guy, but that's what the gnostics said and there was a deep and ancient study of the mystery of life and the mystery of reality.

Speaker 1:          01:08:36       I've read somewhere, I don't remember the source, but I read somewhere where they were talking about the interpretations of ancient languages and the translations from ancient Hebrew, Aramaic, all to Greek Latin. That a lot of things got lost along the way in the confusion and that one of the confusions was that the word apple could could be interpreted also as red and then it wasn't an apple, but that it was a red and that red being the color of the and area that that was. Why? Absolutely. I mean there's folks have to understand if they, they've never tried to pay attention to how people translate ancient languages and then try to translate them several times, not just into, you know, from ancient Hebrew to Latin, but also from Latin degree, from Greek to English. There's so much that gets weirded out along the way. Like if you've ever taken a phrase from like a Russian, a website where you don't know what they're saying and then put it into like Google translate and you see the English version of what they're saying. Oh my God. It's so convoluted and confusing because of the way the structure of their language is very different. The grammar that they use is very different and that it's nothing in comparison to how different it was in ancient time.

Speaker 3:          01:09:52       Yeah. A lot get lost in translation and the translator imposes his or her idea of how things should. Of course on the, on the material and many of the texts that come down to us are highly edited artifacts which are, which are actually representing a particular point of view. That's why these hidden gnostic texts, which just lay buried for 1600 years until they were found in the 19 forties, are extremely, extremely interesting. And, and actually we don't need to rely on translations there. They're worse. Most of the gnostics were wiped out by Christianity when Christianity pooled on the Jackboot of Rome and became the state religion of the most powerful, militaristic empire of the ancient world. Uh, it's set about destroying all competitors and amongst those that destroyed were the Gnostics, but certainly they were burnt at the stake from a very early date, but some gnostic sects survived and they have left us images and there are a number of gnostic churches these guys saw themselves as Christians. There are a number of gnostic churches where they painted the tree of knowledge of good and evil, quite specifically as I'm one to Mascaro. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:10:58       Yeah. And, um, even in French frescoes, what does that fresco from like, uh, it was, I don't remember the year, but it was an Adam and eve portrayal that showed several different types of types of mushrooms. I know that.

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       And it's Adam and eve clearly standing. Absolutely. And it makes you wonder like, this was in not modern times, but not 5,000 years ago. This was like 1200, eight days, just like say 800 years ago, something, something like that. We were at the tail end of the last surviving Gnostics, the cathars in the southwest of France, or an example of a, of a gnostic, a sect who survived through until the Catholic church wipe them out with the so called Albert Jensen Crusades, a truly horrendous act of ethnic murder that took place in the 12 hundreds. So we're actually not that long ago and things have, have survived from that time. And uh, it's very interesting that, that they are clearly indicating that the psychedelic experience is of crucial importance. That it's a liberating experience that allows us to wake up to the true nature of things. Now, of course, they would do it right.

Speaker 3:          01:12:10       They would do it in a sacred context. They would work very hard on the setting to create the place and the space where this experience unfolded. Because that's part of the experience. The substance on its own is only part of the story is anybody who's worked with psychedelics knows the context in which the experience unfolds is at least as important and the intent with which you go into it and what we're seeing now, again, history has been obscured from us, but recent research is showing, for example, the famous Eleusinian mysteries in Greece 2000 years at the temple of abuses. It pilgrims came from all over Greece once a year to undergo and experience and that experience involve drinking a brew. We can now say with absolute certainty that that was a brew closely. There were elements in it closely related to Lsd and that this, do we know that with absolute, because the work has been, the work has been done by Hoffman, by Gordon Wasson and others.

Speaker 3:          01:13:06       Um, there's a, there's a very detailed study of what was in that brew. It was called the Chi on and growing on the barley that was used in the brew was, it was an Erg, got a, a form of got a which contained Lsd, a Mites, and which was soluble in water. They've really done the science and great in great depth and when you read the accounts, you know of of great figures from the ancient world, people like plato or socrates who went and had the experience at the earliest one, mysteries, they drink this. They enter a darkened series of corridors and passageways and chambers in this huge, this huge template and this is light appears and they start seeing visions. It's pretty obvious what's going on. Yeah, pretty obvious that they were tripping in some way, shape or form, and they saw it as nurturing. They saw it as nurturing. They felt that there were several of the ancients who had this experience and who said that after having had this experience, they lost their fear of death, that they. That they understood that it was not, that it was not the end. Now we could argue about that, but that was the experience that they. That they had. Yeah. That's the experience that a lot of people have when they take asset of the things that Larry Hagman

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       said, who is popular American actor. He did this interview when he was on CNN and they were talking to him about death and he said that lsd completely took away his fear of death and he just didn't. It didn't mean what it meant before. Just because you realize you're part of something, be part of something that's the, you know, it is important to have a sense of self because it's important to brush your teeth. It's important to pay attention when you're driving. It's important to take care of your health while you're alive or you'll suffer some ill consequences, but it's also important to recognize that a lot of your need to take care of yourself can be, can overwhelm your greater perspective. The greater perspective of being a part of everything in that it's not just about you and the worst cases of of human beings are the ego's run a muck like the dictator, like Saddam Hussein or the anyone who control. It's all of them. It's all about them and you know, huge insane, and they cut people down and smash and destroy and kill and leave horrible, horrible lives in the wake of their ridiculous detachment. From these universal ideas that we are a part of a giant collective consciousness and that's, it's almost impossible to get to that without something, whether it's yoga, whether it's Dmt, whether it's something that you ingest that gets you to that understanding that that understanding is very difficult to realize with our normal conditioning than their normal alpha male primate behavior. That

Speaker 3:          01:15:55       the problem solving state of consciousness, that's that state of consciousness is not our friend when it comes to understanding our place in the wider scheme of things. It is a friend in many ways and it's a good state of consciousness. But there are so many other states of consciousness that are, that are a volume and the need to be so tough. Now, some people are very lucky and they can, they can get into deeply altered states of consciousness and, and see reality in a different way, uh, without needing to take any substance. It's fine, you know, or they can get there through meditation or they can get there through floating in a flotation tank. But, but for a lot of people, a very powerful vehicle for changing our perspective on the nature of reality has been for thousands of years the psychedelic experience and it's time that we rehabilitated that and, and, and gave it a place in our society.

Speaker 1:          01:16:46       Well, I think as you were talking about earlier that this is a time of great change. I think this is a time of great awakening when it comes to psychedelics. I was listening to this Guy Sturgill Simpson. I tweeted it today. He's just a country music singer who sings about dmt. Oh really? I hadn't come across some men as country music, like old school, Waylon Jennings style country music if you're into that. And I am. I liked that kind of music. I've been really into that of the last couple of years I've gotten. And I've always been a Johnny Cash fan. I've always liked dwight yoakam and some country singers, but I've gotten into a bunch of other stuff recently. But this guy sturgill simpson is like a big part of what he's saying about psychedelics and in a country song, I mean, incredible stuff. Yeah. And I think that that to me just sort of highlights that this is spreading through a bunch of different genres, different art forms. You see a lot of psychedelic art now, not just Alex Gray who's the master, but you see others that are coming along, a lot of psychedelic art work.

Speaker 3:          01:17:45       I see it all the time when I go and speak at events, at conferences, people come to me with their aunt and I'm seeing. I'm seeing this trip to huge explosion of, of a visionary creativity, uh, taking, taking place. And I'm constantly meeting people whose lives have been transformed, uh, by, by these experiences.

Speaker 1:          01:18:03       And I think a lot of people are getting informed by guys like you who have written books on these experiences from supernatural to your own discussions, including the one that got banned from Ted, Ted, ted thing has kind of been exposed as being this really bizarre, almost cultish thing that it's done a lot of. Great. Good. I'm a big fan of a lot of the speakers that have come on Ted, but I had Eddie Wong on the show where he talked about his experience and Ted where they kicked him out because he left there to do my podcast. They wanted them to be a part of this whole thing all day where you didn't hang out. He had to stay in a hotel room with someone else like they made him. He's like, can I get my own hotel room that know the Ted Experience? You have to shack up with some fucking random dude who's talking about physics or whatever it is.

Speaker 1:          01:18:51       We want everybody to be together. It's very difficult. Scientology, well, it's also become intensely profitable and when things become intensely profitable and they come to this giant business, that's. That's part of why your talk got banned from Ted. Instead of having an open discourse about agreeing or disagreeing about what you're saying. There's nothing wrong with that, but your ted talk got banned because of pressure from a bunch of people there were saying that you start using the word pseudoscience. Pseudoscience stop the pseudo science. Yeah. There's almost a cult of people that are afraid of debating ideas that are very controversial and very difficult to nail down, especially when you're talking about the emergence of consciousness in early man. Okay. No one knows how the fuck people got from hunting things to drawing on cave walls to experiencing visionary, a psychedelic states. But we do know that happened.

Speaker 1:          01:19:48       It happened. It happened, and it's worth talking about it. Yeah, we're not. It's not like 1940, whatever the fuck it was when people figured out Iowasca whatever year it was. What year was it? Goes back a very long. No, but I mean Western world. When they. When Mckenna talked about how they first, when they harming, they wanted to call it telepathy telepathy, but they realized that it had already been been scientifically defined as harming. Yeah. So that was. What year was that? That would probably be in 1930. Somewhere $30 or 40. Twenty to 20. And then Watson. Gordon Wasson was in like the fifties. It was $50 goes down to Mexico encounters. Maria Sabina has a mushroom experience and that's the beginning of the mushroom story. In the West actually, so that's like modern western culture and civilization. This is our introduction to it, but this shit had been going on for thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

Speaker 1:          01:20:44       So for us to assume that these you, especially you and I who have had these psychedelic experiences, I've never had an Iowaska experience, but I've had many a dozen dmt trips and mushroom trips. Yeah, there's something there. There's something there that's unbelievably intense and to deny that that had an effect on consciousness of emerging people crazy. It's ridiculous. It's just crazy in my opinion, very anti scientific. It's extremely anti scientific. It is like the modern inquisition, but it's a weird thing where people are ignoring that aspect and concentrating on all the other potential aspects, which I think probably worked in some sort of a symbiotic fashion. Yeah. The introduction of meat into the Diet, the, um, the experimenting with different food sources because of the changing of the climate. There was a lot of factors that came into play that made lower hominids human beings a lot of every evolutionary factors, a lot of environmental factors, a lot of experimental factors.

Speaker 1:          01:21:41       Um, a lot of things happened where there was some benefits to certain types of behavior and those people survived and then things evolved and changed. And then boom, we have Graham Hancock here at 2014 sitting in front of his apple laptop. You know what I'm saying? I mean, there was a lot of things had to take place a lot. It was a, it was a very complicated process, but I'm absolutely sure that psychedelics were a key word, a key part of it. Everyone who's taken psychedelics is pretty sure that it was a key part. You know, why? Because you've had the experience and everyone who doesn't. If you haven't had a psychedelic experience and you're talking about psychedelic experiences being not a factor, a noneffective, you're crazy. Yeah. You'd be better to shut up. Well, it's just nonsense because they have people who have not had the, had the experience at all.

Speaker 1:          01:22:27       I just don't even in my view, need to come to the table because they've got nothing to bring to the discussion. I don't mind if they come to the table, but I find their arguments to be almost hilarious. Yeah, it's like I have a very good friend who's a very intelligent guy and he's never taken any drugs and his take on it is, and he's a brilliant guy, loved talking to him, but his take on it is simply a, all the work's been done. There's no, I'm not going to learn anything new from that. And I'm like, well that's so crazy. Yeah, I'll just say his name, Penn Jillette Rice. I love that guy, but it was the same, but he doesn't do any drugs. It doesn't do anything. Right, and he feels that there is no need for him to say it's all been figured out with all the work's been done.

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       I'm like, Oh God, dude, let me get you high on Dmt last 15 minutes and you tell me what work's been done. See, that's, that's what's so I think what's so special about dmt in particular is that there is that there is no negotiation with the experience. There are very few people who can resist it. Once you hit the hit the threshold because it dose and it's going to take you where it where it takes you a. Then you are confronted by one of the most intense and extraordinary experiences that it is possible for any human being to have. Yes, we can jump out of an airplane at 10,000 feet. Yes, we can scale a sheer cliff. That's also very intense and very, very extraordinary. Yes, we can go scuba diving to the depths, but if we look at the whole range of human experiences and say what is one of the most intense and potentially most transformative experiences as possible to have, I would say dmt done with the right intention and the right context is right up there with anything else.

Speaker 4:          01:24:02       It's the most intense thing I've ever experienced. Me Too. I mean, I haven't experienced everything. Obviously. I've never been scuba diving. I've never been skydiving and it doesn't mean that those things aren't intense as well, but to deny the impact of those things, it seems silly and the people that are arguing against the, the, the, the efficacy of these experiences or against the influence of these experiences to have those people actually have never haven't had taken these experiences arguing against them. It seems so silly. It's crazy. It's crazy. It's crazy that they're scared of them, but it's those people are who are running the rules in our society still. Yeah. Well if they, if they weren't there would be really terrifying. If our society was wrong in the way it is now by a bunch of people doing dmt, you'd be like, what the fuck?

Speaker 4:          01:24:47       Yeah, but that, that's one thing we can be quite sure if our society was run by a bunch of people doing dmt. It wouldn't be running the way that it's run. No, it wasn't. Well, you know, Makenna found out about dmt by a friend who is a scientist to work with the army research lab and they had like a barrel of the stuff, they had a fucking barrel of emt. And if anyone, if you've, DMT is, it's very small doses, they're tiny, transformative. These tiny little doses that you smoke take you into these incredible realm. So the idea of a barrel. Yes, or Lsd, I mean the Mckenna described Lsd and the best way I've ever heard is that the amount of Lsd you need for it to be effective is like an ant that can break down the empire state building in 30 minutes, like exact, literally that little.

Speaker 4:          01:25:34       He was a great genius. And it's um, it's very fortunate. Again, we have the Internet and the Terence Mckenna is his passed in the year 2000. He's still, he's still with us and his and he is having this liberating effect on people all around the world. And he had the gift. He had the gift of language. He spoke in a such a compelling way. I love listening to parents. I do too. Bill Hicks, you know, the two of them together, just amazed, and Hicks was a huge fan of Mckenna and became, I found out about Mckenna because of him because there was a joke where I'm Hicks said, uh, something about leaving mushrooms under the, um, under the table of all these people, take it and it he said what Terence Mckenna would describe as a heroic dose. I don't remember saying who the fuck is Terence Mckenna? And so then I wasn't even a google back then.

Speaker 4:          01:26:25       I searched Terence Mckenna because of hearing about it on Bill Hicks. And then I got ahold of some of the, um, the uh, audio recordings and then you listened to the guy's voice. It's like, wow, what a weird guy, you know, weird, interesting, compelling way of communicating credible use of language a which just makes you think all the, all the time. That's the service he's providing for all of us still. Yeah. I mean, he missed the mark on that December 21st 2012 showed everybody did at. Everybody's got to miss the mark. Guy Used to get high a lot and come up with the cool theories and things to think about and when you're postulating and thinking about the future. Here's the thing about thinking about the future. No one's ever got it right. No, no one has ever figured out the future. There's not a single fucking person ever sat down anybody to get it right.

Speaker 4:          01:27:13       Nobody got it right. The future is. The future is indeterminate. Yeah. It's interesting. I mean, talking about psychedelics, the what's happening with cannabis in the United States right now is, is very, is very interesting to me coming from coming from Britain where you know, nobody has ever even willing to contemplate the legalization or the direct striction of cannabis, but in America state by state, people are voting with their feet and the barriers of being, uh, being broken down. I mean, America has been the huge dark force behind the war on drugs all over the world for the last 40 or 50 years. So many countries around the world have just blindly followed the American lead. That's the American government. That's the American power structure. But the American people are saying, no, the American people are saying, actually we want to smoke cannabis and we find it positive and nurturing for us and state by state, either it's being decriminalized or medical Mariajuana is available or it's actually being legalized in a number of cases.

Speaker 4:          01:28:16       This is a big change. Again, there's all kinds of conspiracy theories like how Monsanto's going to take it over and so on and so forth, but I see it as a really good thing that these barriers in the heartland of the war of drugs are being broken down by the American people themselves and I say Kudos to the American people for getting on and making that happen because it's going to be a benefit to the whole world. Yeah. Warren Buffet is starting to get into the marijuana trade. Oh yeah. That's when things are going to get freaky because then you got a guy who's worth $90, million dollars or whatever the hell he's worth. That's when things can get very interesting. Well, sure. I mean people are going to. People are going to make commercial advantage of this, but at the end of the day I just come back to, this is something that I've said again and again, as the years have gone have gone by, for me, the fundamental issue is the right of the adult

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       to make sovereign decisions about their own consciousness and one of those sovereign decisions has to be the right to use cannabis or not to use it, but one must be free to make that decision and not and not controlled by society and once that is recognized, once all the scare stories about cannabis go away and we find that in fact state by state, it's a. it's a positive rather than a harmful thing. I think that the question marks are going to begin to arise over the psychedelics to and and we're going to. We're going to see all those barriers breaking down in the years to come.

Speaker 1:          01:29:36       Yeah, I think you're right. I think the bringing up Warren Buffett and Warren Buffet's company specifically what's happening is he's a part of this company. He says its subsidiary, subsidiary, subsidiary of Berkshire hathaway has this company called cubic designs and they sell the maximize usable floor space in warehouses and they sent a thousand flyers to weed dispensary's in recent weeks and these flyers, they show these medical marijuana grow ops and it's like double your users growing. This is fucking like, this is intense stuff because it's companies that are real estate holders that have giant amounts of, um, of, of money invested in this that are saying, you know, what we're going to dip our feet into this is growing marijuana industry. And. Exactly. I have a friend who works at a dispensary in Colorado and the dispensary is five acres indoor. Wow. Five acres. That's great. Five acres. That's an enormous building and it's all pot.

Speaker 1:          01:30:43       It's just millions of dollars in marijuana and there's people that are there. This has only been less than a year. I mean it was made legal last January and here we are. We're talking right now. It is September of 2014. This is a crazy thing. I just did my comedy special in Denver and I hadn't been at Denver and while the places changed and it's like marijuana is a huge part of the culture now. People are moving, there's marijuana tourism, people are moving there for marijuana. They're moving there to be a part of the marijuana business because you can get really fucking rich right now because there's a lot of people that are not sure what's gonna Happen federally because it's still illegal federally, so they're not sure whether or not they want to dive into it yet, but the people that are bold that are willing to take a risk or making insane profits a chance of making a sheehan from it and the government is making a lot of money to 39 percent of the profits go to taxes. Wow. So every marijuana joint that's gets sold 39. If it's sold for a dollar thirty nine cents, no one's selling for a dollar, but if it's sold for $100, $39 is going to the government. So they're making over $100,000,000 this year in taxes just in Colorado.

Speaker 3:          01:31:54       Yeah. State government. Yes, and so they're looking at this by the federal government is not reaping the revenues. It's no

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       because it's illegal, it's illegal, but they're finally allowing the people to put their money in banks, which was a long time. They had to do this weird shit where they had to like put it in safe deposit boxes or they had to buy, take the cash and then use it to buy bank notes and the like by bank checks, it's very strange. They weren't allowing them to use credit cards or any of the normal ways that people do business that keep them from being robbed at gunpoint by criminals, untrackable bills, so they had these kids that were driving around with stacks of cash is really dangerous and scary, very dangerous and scary, but it's very. It's very good that the goal of this is changing and I can only see it as a good thing. I don't see any. I don't see any downside in it.

Speaker 4:          01:32:42       It's a really, really positive development that's taking this taking place. I agree, and I think it's also a part of this whole movement that you and I were talking about where the world is changing, information is out there, people are just not prepared to put up with that fucking shit and he longer and not prepared to put up with it, to be told what to think, to be told what to do with their own, with their own consciousness, and it's great that that it's Americans who are leading the way in this and that and the rest of the world is watching and all the lies we've been told about cannabis, they're going to just drift away and be wrecked and destroyed forever by what's happening in America. So it's a great service that's being, that's being done to the world. As you know, I had my own longterm relationship with cannabis.

Speaker 4:          01:33:26       I smoked cannabis for 24 years. I overindulged. I undoubtedly abused my relationship with cannabis. I don't blame the cannabis for that. It was me. I was. I was crazy. I was crazy. A little crazy. I mean, it's very crazy to, to smoke it from nine in the morning until 2:00 the next morning, seven days a week of rather vaporize it as I as I did, and I reached a point thanks to a series of Iowasca journeys in October 2011 where I made the decision that I wouldn't smoke cannabis and it's three years have come since then, but I want to live in a society where I and fellow adults are free to choose either to use cannabis or not to use it without any state agent sticking their nose in our private business. This is, this is our private business, what we do with our own consciousness and, and it's incredibly encouraging to see that the Americans are taking that power back and showing the rest of the world how to do it.

Speaker 4:          01:34:23       And also, um, antipop doctors are being exposed. It's really fascinating. All these doctors that are paid off by pharmaceutical companies. There was an article recently about pot doctors being paid off and all of the leading pot, like antipop doctors, all of them taking it. Oh yeah. All of them. Why am I not surprised? Well, it's interesting that guys like Sanjay Gupta who used to do that, we used to be on board with that now has come out, come out in a huge way and he's also starting to address psychedelics starting to address what's going on with psilocybin

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       and there's the new study that's shown, these people that took psilocybin and quit smoking six months later, 80 percent of them, some, some large number, 70 or 80 percent quit smoking and didn't go back to it. Yeah. Because of just the clarity of those visions where you kind of understand like what am I doing to get that perspective on your, on yourself here and that's, that's the, that's the big news. You know that these, that these things are positive and beneficial and the way forward for society is to create a positive social environment and positive spaces in which in which we can explore these experiences and the result for society as a whole will be very positive and very convinced of that. Vice Dot com is the guy who broke the story. It's incredible and it's all these different doctors that have like, here's one Dr Herbert Keebler of a club or clever of Columbia University.

Speaker 1:          01:35:56       He's been impeccable. Academic credentials has been quoted in the press and academic publications warning against the use of marijuana, which he stresses may cause wide ranging addiction. That's my favorite wide ranging addiction and public health issues when he's writing his antipop opinion pieces for CBS News. CBS News are being quoted by NBR and CNBC. What's left unsaid is that clever has served as a paid consultant to leading prescription drug companies, including purdue Pharma, the maker of Oxycontin, Reckitt Bank bank, Kaiser, the producer of painkiller called neurofen and out comers Alker Mez the producer of a powerful new opiod called Z o h, why dro? How do you say that? Zohydro Zohydro, I guess I can't count. And what you say is what? What, what, what, what, what? He's, what he's been hiding and covering up is that all this stuff he's pushing. That's the real addictive drugs will pay 10,000 deaths a year.

Speaker 1:          01:37:02       It's a multi billion dollar business that causes 16 deaths a year. Just in this, this sixteen thousand sixteen thousand deaths a year stunning and a doctors are on the take to keep promoting that and to stop us exercising our free choice as adults to manage our pain in other ways. For example, with cannabis, and even if it did, it was just 16 desk. Obviously. I agree. Sixteen thousand 16 desks that 16 more than cannabis causing zero. Cannabis doesn't kill any. That's the most ridiculous thing ever. Like you could die from aspirin. A lot of people die every year from aspirin and a lot of people die every year from salt. Too much salt and they die absolutely drink too. We have a painkiller, I think you'd call it a set, a set to a fan. He said, America, we call it paracetamol in in England and had reflux. You liver. Oh, it's really, really dangerous. Dangerous thing and, and, and once it reaches a certain level, there is no recovery from it and it kills thousands. Thousands of people.

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       A year while I was reading this thing about bodybuilder or watching a video rather about bodybuilding and this guy was being interviewed who used to be this big competitive bodybuilder and they're talking to all the drugs that you have to take to get so big, but one of the things you were talking about was that what really kills these guys is not the steroids. It's painkillers, right? They all get hooked on painkillers because they're in pain all the time because they're lifting all this crazy weight and fuck fucking up their body while they're doing it and they take Acetaminophen. All these different values, percosets and that stuff. It just destroys their kidneys. Destroys your liver. Kidneys. Yeah. It's withdrawal symptom from stopping. Taking the painkiller is huge amount of pain, so you then go and take more, more painkillers. These are highly, highly addictive, highly, highly dangerous drugs.

Speaker 3:          01:38:41       Yeah, and state sanctioned. Taken out. Totally, totally state show. So I'm wondering now, three years after I gave up cannabis, whether back in dip my toes back in the water in there in a respectful way, not, not do it every day, have some sacred moments. I value the sensual side of it. I don't know. I'm, I'm, I'm the next time I have an eyewash station I'm going to, I'm going to ask a Iowasca is going to be my intent because that was Iowasca that really interrupted by cannabis habit. I'm going to ask, is there a way I can do this? I don't know. Maybe that's weak of me. I've wondered this. You know, I was talking with a friend last night and he said there is a true addict speaking. You know, I said this because it sounds a bit. It sounds a bit like that, but I, I did volume cannabis.

Speaker 3:          01:39:28       It was, it was an extraordinary positive thing for me in many, many ways. And I, I. What I feel is that I got out of balance with it and if I could, if I could find that balance again and use it rarely at special times, then I think it would be okay. But I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a little afraid to go back there. Well, you should be afraid, right? You know, because you've had personal experience with addiction. And I think that addiction is purely mental. It's purely metal because it was very easy to stop. Once Iowasca gave me the message and I really got that. I, I had a severe kicking first of all, a DMT trip. Then immediately afterwards, five Iowasca sessions I was, I was psychologically beaten up and the message of that beating was you have to stop smoking cannabis and, and uh, and, and I did.

Speaker 3:          01:40:12       And looking back on it, it's absurd to, this is a very, very powerful a plant agent. And here I am, you know, vaporizing it 16 hours a day, seven days a week. You went deep. I went deep. I went, I went, I went, I went very deep. And, and, and, but, and it got to the point where I wasn't enjoying it anymore where I just felt that I couldn't live my life without it, but I discovered I easily could live my life without it. When I stopped, it wasn't a huge chore, a problem to stop. It wasn't actually difficult and then that sense I would definitely was not physically addicted to it. Yeah. That's the thing is that I think there's some people that do get physically addicted.

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       I'm not, you know, I used to say marijuana is not addictive and I don't think it is with most people, but I think biological diversity of biodiversity in human beings is such that there's certain folks that have weird reactions to all kinds of shows and things. Cats, some people around cats like my friend Gary, he can't even come over my house because I have two cats. If he walks in the door he was targeting, gets as wheezing. You can't breathe. Like he has to get out of there. They kill him with a room of cats. But then I got my friend Joey Diaz who has, what is y'all 11? I think he has 11 cats, so motherfucker has 11 credits. Yeah, but if you. If my friend Gary went over my friend show his house, he would. He would die. Yeah, but Joey's having a party over there.

Speaker 1:          01:41:38       He's got cats on his lap. He's pet numb. They're sitting on his shoulders. We're all. We're all different than what works for one person, doesn't, doesn't work for another, and that's again, why, why this issue of adult sovereignty of us having the right to make our choices about our own bodies is fundamental and and actually with the psychedelics and the cannabis issue, that's just the tip of the iceberg of the whole issue of health and personal health and how our society is working to take away our choices over our personal health and to turn us into robots who consume the products that are pumped at us by the big pharmaceutical companies or who are inventing every year this unholy alliance with psychiatrists and venting every year. New mental conditions for which new pills will be. Will be dosed out. Yeah. In England, you guys don't have those commercials either.

Speaker 1:          01:42:30       Those commercials are so fucking insidious. Ask Your doctor about this drug that might cause you to shit yourself all day long. Commit suicide, suicide. The big untold story about antidepressants, the antidepressants caused people to kill themselves. How about antidepressants that supplement the antidepressing antidepressants like there's certain antidepressant, I forget what it was called. It had insane side effects that they were promoting as a supplement to your regular antidepressant. Regular antidepressants isn't doing it until you sit up with this one, but this one could cause fucking kidney failure. Your Dick might fly across the room like a mocking bird. We didn't think anything could happen to you, but you might not be depressed or you might just take our pills. These other doctors, drug dealers, these are the true matthew of drugs. Well, it's also the idea of commercials. Commercials are influential and the influence of commercials is very insidious because there's one thing if a commercial is influencing you to buy a particular vacuum cleaner, but that doesn't bother me man. This is the best it look. If you're, if you're too much of a knucklehead to go and consumer reports or you know, go to read reviews online by independent people that tell you this vacuum cleaner is great, this vacuum cleaner sucks. If you're too much of a knucklehead to do that, I don't feel bad for the executive, but when it comes to consciousness, when it comes to pills,

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       especially when it comes to happiness, man, because that's the big one. Antidepressants, they should we call them happy pills. You know, I wrote an article a long time ago from my blog about happy pills. I called it happy pills and it was about this, uh, this, this, uh, this girl who was taking these, uh, these antidepressants. And I think that the selling of happiness in pill form is the ultimate ridiculous American notion. It's horrible. It's horrible. Uh, it, it's, it's, it's suggesting that the onset does not lie within that, that it can be bought, that happiness can be bold. But I think that the ultimate delusion also what's insidious about it is selling it on television like that does a huge disservice to the actual people that could use antidepressants because they have a real mental imbalance. Sure, there's people that do do that. So like you're selling it as an antidote for a shit life where there's other folks that might have a real issue.

Speaker 4:          01:44:48       They have an imbalanced huge chemical imbalance in the brain and that can be adjusted and adjusted and make their life wonderful. People that have a miserable life, they can make their life wonderful, but instead were people will trivialize it because you see a commercial or a chicken running around a field of wheat and spinning around with her baby and then someone says, I want to live like that. And then they called her a fucking doctor and next thing you know, you're on a pill that you didn't need. If you just start eating vegetables and going jogging every day, you'd be way happier person than you were on that pill. And again, let me, let me say right, I outright that the psychedelics are very effective antidepressants. Psilocybin being trial tested in humans, communities for thousands and thousands of years, Iowaska and the Amazon, at least 4,000 years of use, and anybody who's worked with psilocybin or or IOWASCA enough, we'll know that, that they do help with mood, they do, they do help you take a more positive outlook on outlook, on life and and whether that's to do with altering the chemical balance in the brain because they do work on the serotonin system in the brain chemically or whether it's to do with the revelation that one has, that life is an incredible gift and incredible joy and a privilege to be to be alive.

Speaker 4:          01:46:00       This is, this is what we forget, immersed in the cares and woes of daily life, constantly struggling to meet the next, to pay the bills, to to get on in, in work would relentlessly driven to produce and consume and we forget that it's a magical, enchanted, gorgeous, glorious universe that we live in and we have this amazing bodies and we should just celebrate every minute of it. Psychedelics help with that too. Yeah, it's hard. It's hard to keep a balanced perspective, but it's. I think it's also important to realize that perspective shifting consciousness, shifting experiences can also change the way you look at the world and when you change the way you look at the world, it can adjust the way your brain functions and that it's not an either or situation. It's a Kombucha Tory situation. Sure, they might affect your brain in a very chemical way, but also just the altering of a perspective could enhance your mood and it can enhance the way your body and brain function because the mind is what we are.

Speaker 4:          01:47:01       We are our minds. The mind is the most powerful, the most powerful thing, and that's where all healing, I believe resides. It resides. It resides in the mind. If you can kick in the body's ability to heal itself through right mental attitude, no, no medicine will do that for you, and that's why placebos actually work. You know? That's why they worked better than than the prescription drugs that had been tested. Again, they don't work better than prescription drugs, but occasionally they do do just the fact that they work at all. The placebo effect is not nearly as effective as medicine, right, in most cases, but just the fact that it does work at all, that there's a way that you can tell your body to make itself better and the way is by tricking it to thinking as taking medicine. Look, you're going to be better.

Speaker 4:          01:47:46       I'm going to be better. The alleviation of stress and anticipation of this horrible demise that your impending doom that you can escape with a sugar pill. That's incredible. It's incredible. It says something about the mind set and it's something really worth looking at that further that is enhanced in psychedelic experiences. Perspective enhancing aspects of that I do believe can change your overall health or change overall consciousness, which can change your overall health. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot going on man, and I think these conversations are super important for people that are uninitiated and that haven't. They don't understand what the. What's the Hoopla about? Why is everybody got down with that Rogan's going on about drugs again, I know I. I have. I have a constituency of my readers and people who follow me on facebook who are constantly throwing handcuffs or a druggie and pass at me, and I just feel this is really important.

Speaker 4:          01:48:40       It's a really important conversation to have and fundamentally get right down to the bottom of what it's about. It's about this whole issue of us taking back power over ourselves. That's what it's really about and the and it needs to be seen in that, in that context, to make decisions about our own lives, right or wrong, and to learn from our mistakes and to grow and develop as a result. I think it's also super important that you discussed your relationship with cannabis in an abusive way too, that there's a balance to be achieved. There's a balance to be achieved for all of us. Sort of a strange. That's what. That's what I've. That's what I've learned in a way I. I had to deny myself this wonderful sense you'll plant, which helped me to enjoy food and music and many other essential plays. Sax. Absolutely. You've never had socks on pot. You know what I mean? What you're talking about. I don't even know what led Zepplin sounds like. Exactly. It's a beautiful sense. You will ally, and I've had to deny myself. That sends you an ally for the last three years because I abused it because I might spark up a joint right now. Want

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       to dive in right now? Of course the jail. You're like, you're like the, the garden of didn't sure you want. Yes. You sure? Why not? I don't want to force you into anything. You're not. You're not forcing me. It's an interesting expand now. Now. No, no, no. Not that. I'm going to go. I'm going to go live on Joe Rogan. Is that bad? No, that's not bad. That's the way to do it. If you want to dive in, we'll go a little baby. Hit little baby. Little Baby. My first baby hit in three years. Nothing crazy. Nobody has to get hurt here. Okay. You were showing some images from Lebanon before the POC. What have you gotten into? Well, not by the time I smoked this little baby hit. I'll, I'll probably have forgotten. But um, so what I was getting into was, um, this, this fella here, American shit too.

Speaker 3:          01:50:41       That's not that crappy getting England that's made by American scientists and botanists. They all drive muscle cars and they do steroids. So familiar. That's such a nice feeling. That's, that's back. Can we, are we seeing on the screen? That is. You're going in for another baby hit. She's a little tiny. That's it. Stop right there. Right you to get confused on the way back. We will see. So here it is. Lebanon. This is the um, this is what is called the stone of the pregnant woman. Whoa. I fall back. That's the level on top of that is me on top of that can be a power point demonstration. So we see it. But this, this little, this little tiny dark up here on top of that. That's me in Lebanon. And is this a recent in July? Yes. I was there and I was there in July.

Speaker 3:          01:51:34       People say that Lebanon is very dangerous and this place is right on the Syrian border. But I didn't see any danger there at all. I had a, I had a magical experience in Lebanon. It was great. It was exciting. It was for you, it must be incredible because that's a sight of so many ancient, huge monolithic structures that are unexplained as far as our construction methods are. So the temple of Jupiter at Baalbek in Temple of Jupiter, this is what they call it. It's a rough. There's undoubtedly a Roman temple. They're okay. And that Roman temple dates from the known historical periods some two, 300 years after Christ. It's the Roman temple of Jupiter and it's very extraordinary, but it stands on these huge foundations. There's a group of stones called three stones called the tree lithium, which are, um, each weighing 840 tons, 840 tons.

Speaker 3:          01:52:23       What the fuck? And they are lifted to 20 feet above the ground and built into a wall of sat on top of one of those stones. I've been done underneath it and looked up at it to 840 ton stones. This is this gigantic achievement. Now the Orthodox view is that the Romans did everything that they, they built those foundations and they, the temple I think, and many researchers who have studied them in this field would agree with me on this, that actually the Romans found a much more ancient site and they, which was just extraordinarily megalithic gigantic stones and they built their temple on top of it and later historians have simply given the whole thing to the Romans without considering, uh, what was, what was going on there? And part of the reason I think that is because of these stones that are still in the quarry, which I was trying to.

Speaker 3:          01:53:13       I don't know if it showed up on the screen. I was trying. I got it. You got it. I'm trying to show it, you know, I'm trying to show it just now. These stones stood in the quarry. Okay. Now, so what the historians say is that the Romans. Okay. They found they could move the 840 ton stones. That's 1 million. Six hundred and 80,000 pounds for people who don't like the word ton. You've got your calculator going back to. Because it didn't make sense. I was trying to double it, but it's not double. It's two pounds, 2000 pounds. It's a number. Whatever it is. It's just a CSM number is 6,000 pounds for every ton. So I was going eight to 2000 for each. What? Eight hundred 40 times 2000. Is that real? And then that's where it is. That's what it is. Now a million. So here's the thing, those are the 840 ton blocks in the walls in the foundation of the temple.

Speaker 3:          01:54:02       Then we go to the quarry and we find this humongous thing which weighs over 1000 tons. And there's another one on the other side of the road which was 1,200 tubs. One thousand two, one thousand two hundred thousand to 2 million. Four hundred thousand pounds. Yeah. So here's a fuck. So here's the theory. Okay. The Romans, the Romans found they could move the 840 ton blocks and they did. This is the orthodox theory and then they built their temple on top of it, but they found they couldn't move these thousand or 1,200 plus ton blocks, and by the way, this one is completely separated from the bedrock of which has been caught. They couldn't move them so they left them in the quarry. I think that actually proves that the Romans didn't create the 840 ton megaliths because if the Romans had known that these gigantic blocks in the. If they had cut the blocks, okay, if they had cut them themselves, which we must say they did.

Speaker 3:          01:55:02       If we are saying that the Romans were responsible for these mega list, if the Romans had cut these blocks themselves, they knew they were there and the very first thing they would have used for the smaller blocks that they put into place in the temple of Jupiter was these large blocks. They would have sliced them up like a loaf of bread into smaller blocks and move those over to the temples. The fact that these huge megaliths still standing in the quarry suggest to me that they were buried when the Romans came to that site because otherwise it would have been the very first thing they would have used for quarrying smaller blocks that they were buried and that the Romans found an existing prehistoric megalithic platform. And on top of it they built their temple of Jupiter. That's fascinating theory. Um, it's, it seems like open to interpretation to me.

Speaker 3:          01:55:47       Sure. Absolutely. Yeah. Because you're looking at. But we'll either, you know, regardless of why they built the one. What is it? 1,000,000? Jesus Christ. 2 million. 400,000. It freaky when you done in pounds. That's insane. Yeah. When you do it in tons, it's abstract. Twelve hundred tons. Okay. What does that mean? You know, it's hard for my head. Well, let's consider, bless. Consider an average vehicle which might. Wait, let's, let's push in pounds. So it's about two tons, right? Is that about the weight of an average vehicle? So two tons divide a thousand by that. So you're looking at 500 family sized cars under a thousand, 10,000 tons. Oh my God, it's just the imagining a 2 million pound rock and a bunch of dudes are moving it and we know that someone at some time in history they built that. They moved those stones. I mean it wasn't that one, right?

Speaker 3:          01:56:41       It wasn't. It was. What was the first calculation that we had? What did we say? It was 640 times is that there's three blocks of 800, 84. I joined so closely that you can't slip a sheet of paper between them. I mean they've not been just roughly leave it into place. They'd been set down with perfect with perfect precision. So someone did that. We know that. What did that? And there are plenty of people arguing that the Romans did it. I feel along along with other researchers have approached this a bit. I feel I want to look at alternative possibilities for, for what these mega lists are all about and that's. And that's one of the things I'd been doing for the last year, is traveling around the world looking. I feel so lucky to have the opportunity to do this and just amazing, amazing archeological sites and one of the countries that I visited and I want to really mention this is Armenia, um, where I have seen incredible stone circles, just wonderful dwarfs stonehenge make, make us just standing all and look at the way that these huge megalithic stones in what is called the moonstone circle.

Speaker 3:          01:57:48       They have certain holes drilled in them to align up with particular areas of the sky at an Armenian Akio. Astronomer from that kind of data believes that the place called [inaudible], not just two or 3000 years old, as most historians believe, but well over 12,000 years old. Why did you believe that? Because of the astronomical alignments that the positions of the stars in the sky change very slowly down the ages. That the alignment to the solstices changes because there's a slow nod on the axis of the earth, very, very slow over tens of thousands of years. Which means that if the sun rises at a certain point on the horizon, on the summer solstice today in two or three or 5,000 years' time, that point on the horizon will have changed. You wouldn't notice it in a lifetime. You wouldn't notice it in 10 lifetimes, but if you stay long enough, you'll note that actually the sun isn't rising in the place on the horizon anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       When did we? That's called the procession of the equinox. Well, actually no, that's the second. That's the second. That's a difference. That's the changing tilt of the Earth's axis, which which kind of is a wobble and nods back if there's a wobble and there's a tilt and then there's actually a tilt within the tilt. No, well, yeah. This is the. This is the view, but the effect is because the earth is the viewing platform from which we observed the stars in which we observed the other celestial bodies such as the moon and the sun. The earth is our viewing platform. If you change the orientation in space of that viewing platform, then the rising points of stars, the moon, the sun change, and the positions of the stars in the sky change and it becomes a kind of language. Once you understand this, that it is universally available to us, the calculations can be done.

Speaker 3:          01:59:28       We can do it. Anybody can buy a computer software today which will show you the ancient skies over at any point on the earth's surface at anytime in the last 30,000 years. That's amazing. These and what's involved in those computer simulations is simply calculations that had been done in previous centuries by it, by astronomers, and we understand these, these processes. We can measure them and set them up, but there you have a regularity of changing patterns in the sky. If you tie that into architecture on the ground, then actually you have a way free of all language, of dating, of actually speaking. You can use this universal language of the stars and architecture to make a statement to the future. You can say that this particular time was very important to me, to our culture. It mattered to us, it mattered to us so much that we've created this huge monument to freeze the skies over a particular point.

Speaker 3:          02:00:21       I wonder why those particular constellations, if at all, were important to them. That's where things get really strange and if I wanted to play devil's advocate, I would say, well, these holes, they're pointing up towards the sky. Here's a lot of fucking stars on the show. How do we know? Just because they line up with this and a thousand years ago, it doesn't mean you weren't looking. It's very complicated. So what you want is multiple locks. I mean take the pyramids of Giza and here I cite the work of my close friend and colleague, Robert Robert Duvall in particular in his book, the Orion mystery. You, you take the three great pyramids of Giza and you look at the heavens overhead and you also look at the religious system of the ancient Egyptians. What was important to them? What did they. What did they believe? You pretty soon discovered that stars were incredibly important to them.

Speaker 3:          02:01:13       Stars cover the inside of the ceilings of, of all tombs, of the pharaohs tombs, for, for example, a monuments are lined up to particular places on the horizon. Whereas star, perhaps it's serious who's counterpart amongst the gods was the goddess Isis. Perhaps it's a Ryan who's counterpart amongst the gods who was the goddess Cyrus. Uh, this is the thing. You have a mythology that speaks of entities who have, who are clearly stated to be connected to particular asterisks, particular, particular constellations. That's the first thing. Are The constellations that are being said to have a reflection upon the ground and architecture, were they significant to the culture concerned? Well, yes, absolutely. The constellation of Orion was of enormous significance to the ancient Egyptians. Therefore, it has to be a matter of interest that the three pyramids on the ground are laid out in a pattern that is temptingly similar to the pattern of the three belts, stars of the Constellation of Orion.

Speaker 3:          02:02:09       That's fascinating. Temptingly similar, but there's something else. Then you have shafts which run through the body of the Great Pyramid you have. There's a place called the king's chamber high up in the Great Pyramid. It has a shaft and it's north and south wall, which are about eight inches high and eight inches wide, and those shafts cut all the way through the body of the pyramid and they come out on the south and north sides of the pyramid. You can actually, and it's been done in the past, you can drop a cannonball in, at the outside entrance to those shafts and they appear and that cannonball moments later will appear in the king's chamber, the shelter about 200 feet long. Okay. In the Queens Chamber down below, there are also two shafts. Uh, these shafts do not exit on the outside of the pyramid, which creates a mystery of its own, of great interest.

Speaker 3:          02:02:52       What is it? The other end of those shots, but they do have very definite alignments. And what Robert was really the first to show some archeo astronomers were, we're onto this as well in the case of some of the stars, but what Robert was really the first to show is that in 2,500 BC, the epoch in which Egyptologists say the pyramids were built, all of those foreshafts that shoot up out of the king's chamber and the Queen Chamber all targeted very significant stars in the sky at that time. Like for example, the southern shaft of the Queens Chamber targeted the star Sirius at exactly the moment that the star crosses the Meridian. That's the north south line that divides the sky above our heads at exactly the moment that the star crosses that line. The shaft targets it and you could, you could fire a laser beam up and you'd hit that.

Speaker 3:          02:03:39       In theory, you'd hit that, start the, the, the, the alignment is that great. So they locking the pyramid in in the epoch of 2,500 BC, two four significant stars in the sky. Another one of those stars is the lowest star of the belt of Orion. That tells us that this is a dating mechanism of some kind and it it can't be an accident that that's the case and once you understand procession, you understand that these alignments will change, so therefore it becomes very interesting to discover that the orientation of the pyramids on the ground is that which Robert argues are the terrestrial reflection of the three stars of the belt of Orion, that the orientation of the pyramids on the ground because of procession shifts very slowly down the ages. And if you, and you can see this clearly on any good sky map program as you go back in time, you find that the constellation of Orion at the moment it crosses the Meridian.

Speaker 3:          02:04:32       The same place that was targeting the star Sirius at the moment. It crosses the Meridian. That the perfect alignment between the belt stars for Ryan and the three Great Pyramids of Giza is not in 2,500 BC, but in 10,500 BC, 8,000 years earlier. So we have a very interesting problem here. Either it's all coincidence or the pyramids are monuments that speak both to the age of the ancient Egyptians, 2,500 BC and to a much earlier time, wasn't it? Also the same time where the Sphinx was pointing towards the Constellation Leo? Well, that's the again, the third part of the lock, and Robert and I looked at this in depth together in our book called the message of the Sphinx, and so we have the Giza plateau. We have the three pyramids laid out on the ground in the pattern of the belt of Orion in 10,500 BC. That's looking south. Now let's look east.

Speaker 3:          02:05:21       Let's look Julie's east east of course, where the sunrises, but people who don't observe the sun don't realize that the sun tracks back and forth along the horizon during the solar year reaches its most northern most point on the summer solstice 21st of June, and it's southern most point on the winter solstice 20, 20, first of December. On the equinox. The day that night and day are of equal length. The sunrises directly, perfectly due east. That's actually how you define an equinox because the sun is rising perfectly Jewish and looking at it is the sphinx aligned gazing directly perfectly at the point of sunrise. Now we have to consider what's behind the sun. Then what is the constellation of the Zodiac that the sun is rising in because that's what the Zodiac is. It's A. It's a group of constellations that by chance that the son passes through during the course of the year, but that the constellation that the sun rises against, the background of it is also affected by precession, the wobble on the axis of the earth, and that changes.

Speaker 3:          02:06:28       You have roughly 2,160 years in each house of the Zodiac for the last 2000, 160 years. We've been in Pisces and as I often say, it's not an accident that the the early Christians use the fish as their symbol. Before that it was the constellation of areas. The Ram Ram's were incredibly important in the year from 2000 down to the time of Christ. Just look at the biblical stories. Anyway, to cut a long story short, the Great Sphinx is a lion, admittedly with a human head, but that head is rather small and we think that the head almost certainly was recovered in a later time. Probably the whole statute was originally Elian crouching there on the horizon, gazing Julie East at the rising sun on the equinox and at the Constellation pint the sun, and that constellation is in 10,500 BC, the constellation of Leo as above. So below Leo speaking to the Sphinx, uh, Ryan speaking to the pyramids, locking in to a date that is far before any civilization began.

Speaker 3:          02:07:28       And I, I know I'm on a long wrap here, but just at that, at, at, at, at that point when the egyptologist well, it's impossible for there to be any thing like a civilization at Giza 12 and a half thousand years ago. Just when they're very happy saying that, and they're telling us that no other monument can be found anywhere in the world, which is 12 and a half thousand years old on this scale. Lo and behold, up pops go directly to Epi in Turkey. Go back to in the area of Turkey that by the way was once historic Armenia go, Beckley tempe pops up. It's dated by the German archeological institute. They discovered that this huge complex of stone circles has been deliberately buried 10,000 years ago and the carbon dating, because you can't date stones, you have to date organic materials. The carbon dating of organic materials found with those stone circles puts their age back to 12,000 years.

Speaker 3:          02:08:21       I'm more for you. That must have been like Christmas. It was Christmas. It was Christmas. It was like. It was like a gift. I, I, you know, I don't, I don't want to. I have to confess. I mean, we all have egos. Of course. I have to confess that, that it was a nice moment for me when the New Scientist magazine in Britain, which years ago, back in the nineties when I published fingerprints of the gods, was amongst the magazines that tact my work as quote unquote pseudoscientific and all of the. I don't know how my work can be pseudo scientific because I don't claim to be a scientist. I'm a fucking journalist. You know? I'm not, I'm not a scientist, how can I be a pseudo scientists, but here's a guy who's got an obsessed with an idea. I kind of, and I'm a little weed, like that's actually New Scientist magazine back in the 19 nineties was saying that I was wrong, where the basic message of fingerprints of the gods is history as much older and much more mysterious than we'd been told, so it was great in October 2013 when you.

Speaker 3:          02:09:18       This magazine came out with a headline saying history is much older and more mysterious than we thought. It's funny. The Hancock was right. Title showed up in my next. Sorry Dude. In my next life we were fucking with you, but there was, there was happy and that's what changes everything. Yeah, they're really done. By the way. I'll just say I guess we may be running out of time, but I'll just say, are we good? I just say also Indonesia, which is the other place that my wife Santha and I've done a lot of research in the last six or seven months, has been found. What was thought to be a 2,500 year old site on top of the hill. I'm a site made of blocks of columnar basalt, which forms naturally but which can be used as a construction medium. Okay. It's called Gunung Padang. And on the top of the hill in a series of terraces is a rather extraordinary monument, thought to be about 2,500 years old, made of these blocks of columnar battled.

Speaker 3:          02:10:18       Um, no really thorough research has ever done by archeologists. A little bit of trenching down to about half of half a meter in depth was done and some carbon was brought up and dated, but really the site, it was just kind of taken for granted that it was two and a half thousand years old. Along comes Danny Natoya ggn, who is a caltech trained phd geologist, a working out of the city of Bandung in a government agency of the Indonesian government. In fact, he particularly focuses on earthquakes. Earthquakes are his thing. Um, he comes along and he's intrigued by Gunung Padang first of all, that there's old traditions about it being a sacred place. It's go back at, it seemed to go back a very, very, very long way and he starts to look at it as a geologist and what he realized is suddenly it comes to him. He's not looking at a natural hill.

Speaker 3:          02:11:03       He's looking at a pyramid on top of which is this relatively recent monument, but somebody built a pyramid there, so he begins work on this, so it's covered in dirt. It looks like a grown, but it's inside. It's a. it's a manmade structure. That was Danny's intuition, but then he had to prove it, so he put together a team and they did a huge amount of remote sensing work and some core drilling down to depths of about 15 meters into the top of the hill and what they. What they discovered was incredibly tempting it, it supports Dan, his intuition that we are looking at a manmade pyramid here. It has produces dates that go back as much as 26,000 years right into the last ice age and the remote sensing equipment shows rather regular cavities inside the monument, which looked like chambers of some kind. Well, naturally Danny and his team were stopped working for quite a long while by the archeological establishment in Indonesia who said, we know that this structure is two and a half thousand years old and there's no need for any further research on it and it just disturbs the local villages and um, uh, you know, go away.

Speaker 3:          02:12:08       And so they lobbied and they had him stopped. Uh, but donny took it to the highest level. He got the support of the Indonesian government and two and a half weeks ago they started work excavating, thoroughly excavating. And so far the results look very interesting to see a building 26,000, 26,000 years old. And again, you know, we can't, I can't summon up a map magically, but if I were to do so, consider Indonesia, which is a long string of islands today. But if you go back 12 and a half thousand years ago, that long strip of art, string of islands is joined to a gigantic mainland, huge, you know, ice age continent because sea level is hundreds of feet lower. And therefore, Indonesia becomes actually quite a plausible play place for some sort of whole of records, some sort of time capsule because Rebecca is also a time capsule that's so absolutely incredible.

Speaker 3:          02:13:00       I can't say fascinating anymore because people started giving me shit about it. Last few podcasts I see. I don't know when things are fascinating. I would camp come up with any. You know me. It was my way of going, whoa. There's interesting stuff happening happening in the world. I've been lucky to spend some time exploring this. I am writing a sequel to my best known book and undoubtedly his fingerprints of the gods, the evidence for earth lost civilization. There was that 1995, 1995, and now you know, after being scorned and put down by the archeological establishment, there is enough new evidence out there for me to produce a whole other book. There's a whole other story to tell. Not An update of fingerprints of the gods would with a new book which looks at all of this information. What's going on in Stonehenge? This most recent monuments, they discovered bigger than the rest of Stonehenge stonehedge.

Speaker 3:          02:13:49       They. That's the thing, you see this why archeologist need to be a little more humble because the next turn of the spade can change everything completely alter the story and we should always remain, remain open to just a one discovery like that one farmer finding this stone and go back with on earth. This incredible structure that rewrites history literally turn to the space. That piece of stone is seen by American archeologists in the 19 fifties really, and they decide not to look at it because it's so finely done that they think it belongs to the Ottoman period within the last four or 500 years. Actually it turns out to be 12,000 years old. What's good that they didn't fuck with it?

Speaker 3:          02:14:28       It's cool that it happens this way. Got The German archeological institute later. Unfortunately they've stuck a hideous roof over the top of the top. Now they have. Oh, it's trying to keep it from decaying or something. Look, it was 19 years. It was exposed to. The Sun was out there. It was being. They began the excavations in 1996 and it's fine. Fine, and now that they finished the excavations, they decided that in that particular area, they're excavating other areas, they decide to stick this horrendous roof over it, which cuts out the light, makes it impossible to see the stump is the roof is badly built, so it there are platforms built inside it on which huge heaps of stones have been part of. That's to keep the roof on if there's any high winds, so suddenly so suddenly the possibility of any kind of magical experience at the world's most intriguing and mysterious ancient site is completely written off by this hideous piece of soco protective architecture, which in my view is just the worst kind of vandalism.

Speaker 3:          02:15:22       I've really offended by it. I went back to. I was in Tibet in 2013. I went back again this year and I am. I was just horrified. It made me feel physically sick to see what had been, what have been done to it. That's so bizarre. The desire to. Is it because to sell tickets so people have to pay to get in there? I think. I think it's a kind of. In this case, I think it's a kind of possession. This is ours. We've seen it with the experts, with the authorities. Nobody else. We're really get to form an opinion about it because we're going to damage it's appearance so much in protecting it that it'll, that it'll lose its essential mystery. Well, it just seems bizarre that they're trying to protect stone. That doesn't make any sense. It's like, imagine if someone decided to put a giant canopy over the sphinx and be like, what are you talking about? Big Bear forever. This is being done at archeological sites around the world has been done at dre and I go him in, in Malta, which have profound, astronomical alignments. You stick a fucking great dome over the top of it, you know, um, it's being done at Rosslyn Chapel in Edinburgh. Everything and the worst of the worst

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       vandals or often the authorities, those who, those who are in control. Well, that's how we asked guys in the pokey now, right now, he's not, didn't get arrest him. He did, but all the challenges. Withdrawal. Oh, he came up with some shackles situation. He said he's a big front man for Egypt, still running everything over there. No, he's not running everything, but he's got an official position in relation to the promotion of tourism and so bizarre when you see those guys so vehemently opposed to new information, which is essentially what the idea is being proposed are there's new information. Yeah. There's certain pieces of new information that in my mind or just undeniable the Robert Schoch stuff. I mean, I'm trying to. I my first trip to go back to Tempe, Robert Shuck and I traveled together. You guys made a video, right? There was some filming yet, but we were.

Speaker 4:          02:17:16       We were at Rebecca tappy in December. Uh, sorry, not go back to tempe at Gunung Padang in Indonesia. Shock and I were were there in December 2013 and then I went back again with, what was his impression of it? His impression was very much that this is an intriguing site. He looked at the, you as a geologist, he can understand what remote scanning paperwork looks like and he looked at what Danny's team had produced and said, this is absolutely fascinating. It really deserves further research and that's now what it's getting fortunate. Well, it's just amazing when they uncover these things like I love the ones that they find in Mexico when they're like building something and then they stumble upon some ancient Aztec temple. Not many people who go to Chichen Itza and see the temple of cookware can there. The pyramidical con, which is the famous monument petition eater.

Speaker 4:          02:18:02       Not many people realize that there's another pyramid inside it which is inside it. There's a little door at the bottom of the stairway and I don't think it can be done now. The place has been so tightly controlled. I don't think people even allowed to climb the pyramid of cuckold con. When did they stop that? I believe that stopped in the last two or three years. I was bare. I know it may be a little longer. I was in the last time I was there was in 2010 and then it was stopped with Roseann by people's feet. I don't know, maybe maybe all kinds of arguments, but. But the fact is it was possible to climate. Yeah. I used to back in the nineties anyway, inside it is a whole second pyramid. The pyramid that we see has been built on top of an earlier one and there's a passageway leads up to the top of it and there's an altar and there's a figure of a Puma or a Jaguar.

Speaker 4:          02:18:51       Inside is very spooky place. Wow. Yeah. That whole. The whole complex is so incredible. It's so amazing to think that, you know, I know you scuba dive. You ever done those tunnels that they found in the Senate? No, no. Those are terrifying. These people scuba dive and they go. There's is mind tunnels that they had found that are underwater. Yeah. So you have to, but the people that are treasure hunters have gone into these things and you found these incredible artifacts. Yeah, but you gotta be willing to swim underwater. Scuba gear in a dark tunnel for a long time. They're long. Like you can get a mile in

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       that. Temporary takes. Tremendous courage also takes, it takes very special equipment. Um, you know, you're having to having to carry a lot more air with you and it would be a very complex mixture of gases. Sometimes they have narrow pastures. Do you have to squeeze through one of the most cave? Cave diving is one of the most dangerous things you know, because. Because I'll tell you why, because the entrance passage can be long and winding. There can be several alternative routes through it and it's often heavily laden with silt with sediment. If the dry, if the diver is not very experienced or if the diver panics and starts thrashing around, that silt, silt gets thrown up into the water and completely fills the water so that you can't see your hand in front of your face and suddenly your mile in 100 feet deep and blind. Oh fuck.

Speaker 3:          02:20:18       That was one of the most legitimate freak out you've ever had on a podcast right there. You're saying that me thinking that was just a tremendous freak out. Yeah, just the idea of being, knowing that it's going to run out of air before it settles to. Yes. Oh yes. You're done for. Unless unless you can find your way, unless by some miracle you can find your way through that fog where the very first thing, if you're going to do that, that you have to do is you have to calm your mind. You're freaking me out, man. Yeah, yeah. Well, let's talk about my novels then. Well, listen, those people are just brave as far. It's amazing that people are willing to do that. It's guts. It's courage. It's courage. Courage of the warrior in a way. So is this. How many novels have you written there?

Speaker 3:          02:21:02       So I've written three. Just the third. Well, I've written an entangled, which is a whole other story. And then I've written volume one and volume two of war. God, the first volume was war God, knights of the, which it was published in 2013. There was a big support and take up from your audience, which has beautiful, really grateful for. I heard a lot of positive reviews to people. Enjoyed it. Thank you. And I made A. I made an offer at that time on your show where I said that if people wrote to me at a particular address, which is war God dedications@gmail.com, and sent me their own address and showed me that they've pre ordered the book, I would send them assigned dedicated bookplate. In other words, I would sign a label. I would dedicate it to them. I would send it to them. Little did I know that nearly 5,000 people would ask for those signed dedicated book plates.

Speaker 3:          02:21:50       It became a massive labor of love for myself and my wife Santha. She's doing the envelope thing. I'm dealing with the correspondents putting the signing, signing the book plates. We go to the post office were spending thousands of pounds on postage and that. But it was great. It was a fantastic thing and it gave and it. And it helped the book to get noticed. Um, because there was great skepticism about buying a second volume from my publishers unless the first volume worked. And the first volume worked enough for me to to be commissioned to write volume two of what God, which is called war God, returned to the prelim serpent and that is published on the ninth of October. And I'm making the same special offer. Very Limited. Don't do to you, but it's going to be a bit different. First Time. First off the, if you go to my website, go to www.grahamhancock.com and go to the war God page.

Speaker 3:          02:22:40       It's very easy to get there. I'm right. Scroll down at the bottom of the page that shows the covers of all the additions and you will find a statement there. And that is that if people write to me, if people preorder, first of all, they have to preorder either order volume one or preorder volume to Amazon. Don't take your money until they actually send the book. And I've got the links to Amazon.com. They're a, I will when I finished my travels and I'm going to be on the road until the 27th of October. Uh, but during November I will send out those book plates again. But what I can't do this time is I can't get into personal correspondence with people. It was very interesting. It was very touching and heart and heart warming thing that so many people wrote to me and so many of them I wanted to speak back to them.

Speaker 3:          02:23:28       It's very cold, you know, to receive a letter and not to reply. So. So I did, but I. The problem this year is that I've got to write the sequel to fingerprints of the gods and I really need to start that during November because my research travels will be over at that point. I've got to write that and I can't spend two months or three months corresponding in detail. So my, my offer is right to me. Show me that you've bought the book or preordered volume to a and above all, please give me your postal address because you can't imagine how many times people write to me asking for the book flights and don't get me their postal address. Please give me your postal address and when I get back from my travels, I will sign the book plates. I will send you a signed book plate, which is simply a label that you can stick inside your copy of the book and that if, if, if that results in a bit more uptake for war God too, it'll be good for me because it's very difficult to start a new career as a novelist at the age of 64.

Speaker 3:          02:24:23       Uh, and we really enjoy it. I love it. I love writing novels and I love getting. This is why I was talking about warriors earlier. I love getting into the spirit of the warrior.

Speaker 3:          02:24:34       I don't know why it's fascinating. It's just, it's just absolutely fascinating what would drive a man like Cortez to take 490 men and, and face them against the might of the Aztec Empire, hundreds of thousands of men under arms who will kill you in the most awful way if they, if they catch you, what kind of will does it take to do that? And, and it was, it's been interesting for me to get inside the heads of these people and also to consider because I'm interested in them supernatural elements where they being misled by demonic forces in some way. That's something that, that exam. So I love doing it, but it's, I'm known as a nonfiction author and that's mainly what I do. Uh, people by nonfiction because they're interested in the subject. Very often people buy a novelist because they trust that novelist and know that his next book will be good leadership.

Speaker 3:          02:25:20       Your fascination with demons. What's your fascination with supernatural influences and the concept of demons? For a long time, I didn't believe in any spiritual element to life. I was, I didn't see any of that at all. It was only really when I send, and this is where my credit is, we'll say, well, handcuffs gone nuts. You know, it was only really when I started drinking Iowasca in 2003, I suppose for a decade before that, I'd been immersed in the ancient Egyptian texts. And the ancient Egyptians are all about the quest for immortal life. They're all, they're all about how you live this life to continue on as a, as a spirit and ultimately to live the life of millions of years, and they very clearly indicate that dark forces are at work in the universe which can mislead us as well as there are light and positive forces that we can choose to follow, which will lead us into very nurturing and worthwhile and excellent directions.

Speaker 3:          02:26:16       All those influences are there. So that's there in ancient Egypt. Then I start drinking. I asked her in 2003 and I encounter, um, seamlessly convincing parallel realms, inhabited by intelligent beings, some of whom a seem very dark and dangerous and some have, and some of whom are filled with light and joy and, and exercise the power of healing. Now, I absolutely accept that all of this could be a projection or a creation of my own mind, that there is no exterior reality to it whatsoever. It's just, that's all there is. Um, but I don't think it's that way. I think. I think that what happens in a deeply altered state of consciousness is that we've reached in the receiver wavelength of the brain and and counter other levels of reality that are normally closed off to our senses. And the first thing I would say to any.

Speaker 3:          02:27:08       I know that a number of people who've worked with psychedelics in depth haven't come to that conclusion. I know that, but the conclusion that I come to my, the little offering that I bring to the table and that many others have brought is that there is a separate freestanding reality of some kind which we don't fully understand yet. And that in altered states of consciousness we can encounter, interact with that reality. That's the. That's the view that I have now. In that reality are spiritual forces. Some of which seem to eat fear in energy and, and, and, and dark energy. They thrive on. They think they seem to thrive on anything that's miserable or wicked or, or, or, or cruel or thoughtless of viral about humanity. And at the other side of it are entities that glow with light and love and that and that seek to show us how we may bring to light that divine spark within us to go back to the GNOSTIC, gnostic idea, those you encounter in a very direct way in the Iowaska journey, um, because unlike, you do encounter them in the DMT, Jenny too, they're not quite the same.

Speaker 3:          02:28:18       But unlike DMT I asked, it allows time for really processing and thinking through what you're experiencing. It's, it's unfolding over four hours, not four or five minutes. And that, you know, that is, is a huge effect and it had a huge effect on me and I, I'm, I'm, I'm not adamant about this. I accept. I could be fantasizing it all. It's interesting. The other people encounter pretty much the same beings and, and the same sort of drive to do something better than they've done before. It's interesting that there's that transpersonal side of it. I choose to believe that there are freestanding parallel dimensions and that we are encountering them in altered states of consciousness. And therefore there's interesting scientific work to be done because in theory we could actually begin the targeted exploration of those dimensions by using volunteers on psychedelics. I choose to believe that that's what's going on.

Speaker 3:          02:29:06       I could be completely wrong. It could just be the majesty of the human mind and we just invent all these worlds. That's what I was going to ask you. What's the most compelling argument against it? Like what's the most compelling art article? A argument rather from a neurological standpoint like has anybody ever explained to you like what's going on? There isn't a compelling argument. I don't know. There isn't a compelling argument. There's a reference frame and the reference frame, and this is again where where I got myself into so much trouble with Ted, the reference frame is the reference frame of materialist science and that reference frame says that all consciousness is a kind of accidental epi phenomenon of brain activity. There's actually no reality to consciousness. That is not something that's been proven scientifically and experimentally. It is just the way that a large and influential group of scientists see the world that everything can be reduced to material causes.

Speaker 3:          02:29:57       So the changes in brain activity that accompany visions, you can measure, you can observe those changes on MRI scanner, those changes in brain activity are the experience you're having according to this reference frame. Your, the, your experience can be reduced to that and there's nothing else to it, but that's not a fact. That is a, that is a philosophical view about how reality works. We don't know for sure. It could easily be the other way round, um, that, that the brain activity is simply necessary in order for us to see something that was always there, but it was normally closed off to our senses. So the, the, the compelling argument as far as like, what's happening when you're having these extreme visual experiences, what's, what does the argument. Has anybody ever tried to explain it? Is it just some supposed to be some chemical reaction with your cerebral cortex? That's the. Yes, that is the, that is the materialist reductionist view, but it's just that and nothing more. But there's a whole other view on it. Rick Strassman at the University of New Mexico, you're very familiar with his weight because you presented the spirit molecule. Yes, Rick's Rick Strassman does entertain the possibility that what is going on is not merely in and of our brains but does represent stable, freestanding dimensions of reality. We have no facts in but we have an incredibly

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       intriguing area to inquire into, you know, and it's also one of those things where I feel like when you've experienced it yourself, you get a really better frame of reference as to why this is compelling it all because it sounds preposterous to someone who has no experience. I know it really does. You know, because. And I'm going to have loads of people saying handcuffs at Draghi of course too late, but there's that thing that people want when you want to define certain aspects of, of whatever the psychedelic experiences where they seem to be almost impossible to define for people who have actually experienced it. Yes. The real problem is when someone who hasn't experienced it tries to define it and it's like, man, you can come up with a bunch of really compelling arguments from a medical standpoint. It's to like what is, what's the effect on the cerebral cortex?

Speaker 4:          02:32:09       What's the effect on the visual aspects of, you know, the, your interpretation of this thing is because of this chemical interacting with that. That's all fascinating, amazing stuff. But the science is bad science to present it as fact when it isn't. I have many times given this very simple analogy of the telescope, um, which I think explains the logical problem in the materialist view. If you want to look at a distant star with your telescope, you're going to point it at the right area of the sky first of all, and then you're going to focus it. And as you focus it, physical changes will take place in the relationship between the lenses inside the barrel of the telescope. Yeah, right. Okay. Eventually the star will come into view and you can see it clearly. You'd be completely wrong to say that the star is the physical changes inside the barrel of the telescope.

Speaker 4:          02:32:57       Those physical changes have simply allowed you to see the star with my fucking mind, and that's the same idea with Dmt, that it's that it's changing brain function to allow you to see something that you couldn't. It's refocusing the brain in other words. Wow, that's very possible. It's an interesting inquiry. I'd never thought about it that way. I don't think. Not Entirely and and interesting experiments could be done to test that with human volunteers. You could. You could begin to investigate if there is a freestanding reality, then we ought to be able to get certain information out of it that they should be possibilities. So you know, we always had just started as a chemical gateway. Yeah, but I think this is a way better way of explaining it. The idea of a telescope having to focus in to see something and then the chemicals focusing you in that a chemical, your own brain makes your brain makes it focusing Ulan and perhaps for some very good reason.

Speaker 4:          02:33:52       Wow, that's amazing. I never thought about that way before, but whatever it is, it's pretty fucking profound and for someone to comment on it, that hasn't taken. It seems kind of silly, especially because it's only 15 minutes is disrespectful to speak of. It too is it's fine to speak of it, but it's disrespectful to put it down without having had the guts actually to have the experience yourself. Don't you think it's becoming more and more accepted though? Because I think for a long time academics resisted taking it or if they did take it, talking about it because they didn't want to be labeled because there's a lot of people have that will label you. If you talk about psychedelic recently, it's been considered a career relenting move and I can talk very recently, even though they all knew the news, it'll knew the positive side of this, but this is again gradually changing and again, I think the the American role, the role of the American people in changing the legal status of cannabis state by state is also going to feed into this and allow us to have a more rational dialogue regarding psychedelics, which can be.

Speaker 4:          02:34:55       Of course, I'm not saying to people yet go out and take psychedelics. What I'm saying is that these are very powerful agents and that they can be extremely healing used in the right way and they can change our whole view of reality. Why should we be forbidden to explore that if as responsible adults we choose to do so? Yeah, it's, it's, it's the argument is stupid and I think the argument is eventually going away and I think it will be replaced by a new argument and then the new argument is what the fuck is really happening? Yeah, and your. Is it your question about it or your proposal is vast, very fascinating one, but whatever it is, those things are there and you can benefit from them or not. It's up to you, but yeah, it's the fact that we live in a world where those are illegal is is, is crazy, it's gone, and if people are having very bad experiences from time to time with psychedelics, part of the reason for that is the world we've created where these are illegal and where it's impossible for people to get good advice that they can trust them with as this atmosphere of danger and threat that surrounds it.

Speaker 4:          02:35:58       Take all that away and this very powerful instrument can be managed much more effectively. No, no, no doubt, and I equate it a lot of ways. This, this idea of it being bad and negative, acquainted a lot of ways to vaccinations and here's why there's this vaccination is anti vaccination movement in this country. A lot of people feel like vaccinations are unnecessary and they may have some good arguments. They may have some good arguments, especially about some certain vaccinations for things that are sexually transmitted, diseases and things along those lines like hepatitis shots and shit. You're given a little kid, so there's a real good argument against that and there's a little. There's definitely an argument that there's a lot of medication the kids are taking and is it the right amount, but there's no argument that vaccinations haven't saved a fuck ton of lives because they have.

Speaker 4:          02:36:50       They've stopped a lot of diseases. Data and attract. Absolutely, but they also, much like we talked about, some people are allergic to cats, some people are very different biological reactions to all sorts of different chemicals and there's going to be some adverse reactions. Something in your body that I absolutely agree that the vaccination is incredibly effective medical tool in many ways, but there also is a kind of vaccination mafia because they are the ultimate mass medication and people are making money. There's no doubt there's whenever there's profits, there's fuckery. There's no getting around it. Just the way he even being side by side. So the. Yeah, it's. It's one of those scenarios very much like psychedelics in a way that the are going to be some rare cases. If we make psychedelics legal across the board, there's going to be some rare cases of a person in a bad state of mind or a bad mental makeup or what have you.

Speaker 4:          02:37:41       Pad psychological makeup, you can fill in the blanks where they take it and it's detrimental to them. It's going to happen and that'll be highly publicized and used as an argument to stop all of these freedoms and building access is ridiculous. Have the very best answer to that as I'm sure as I'm sure you remember, you know the, the, the, the lunatic who leaps out of the window and he can fly on Lsd. Why didn't the fucker try and take off from the ground? He goes, we lost a moron. The world got lighter. Exactly. World got lighters. One of my favorite lines. Beautiful. But that's, um, that is, uh, you know, it's, it's just a strange argument to keep people from doing it because, especially like this doctor that we were talking about earlier that's talking about cannabis in the addictive properties of cannabis, and this isn't even talking to someone who was addicted to cannabis and you, it's still, it's a silly, I like, there's a lot going on when someone's addicted.

Speaker 4:          02:38:35       It's not all necessarily chemical and the ones that are chemical you're getting paid for, so that doesn't even make any sense. The ones that chemically make you addicted as the ones you're getting money from, people are fed up with all of this shit because it's so corrupt and it's so wrong and it's time that is time that a new direction was taken. And there are people who are on the wrong side of history on this and the will be. But we are moving forward. I think we are as well. I think it's, uh, it's, it's pretty cool to see too. Yeah. But, you know, I think it's also important that a guy like you who smoked pot from 9:00 AM to 2:00 AM every day, seven days a week, seven days a week, 365 days a week, going to enormous length to be able to obtain it.

Speaker 4:          02:39:13       When I was traveling, I was that of sources that it is, it is. Um, I, I do know what I'm talking about. I had a long relationship with it. And um, I understand how, how do you feel now having good dip back in the water? A little bit. I feel good, but I don't feel any urge to become that guy again. My clarity, I've, I, I was able to write with cannabis, but since I stopped smoking cannabis, I've been clear. My mind has been a clarity. So there's a certain fog was lifted. That fog wouldn't have been there if I'd had one joint at the weekend and that was all but it since I was smoking all day long. That's why it was there. It's nice not to have that felt. Yeah, go to bed. I feel more productive. I write my novels. I can write 5,000 words a day, sometimes I'd get sucked the zone, so into the flow. Um, you know, that all that is good and I feel I feel good about it. And I think field probably in the long run, my right choice would not be have a big, have a big relationship with cannabis. I think I've done that. Been there, done that. Know I've got the t shirt.

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       For me, it's a tool. I don't use the same tool every day is that sometimes I'll use any tools, need it, but it has a pretty profound effect a lot of ways. You know, one of my favorite things to do is at night get high and go down to the beach and stare at the ocean. I used to love doing that. Oh my God, I think freaks me out when I'm high. When you're, when you're this, it's a goddess. It's a monster. It's a living thing almost. It's a force. It's a nature force that doesn't give a fuck about you. I think there's one reason why like people that live by the beach or so mellow. Yeah. The beach communities are notoriously mellow. That's true, and I think one of the reasons why they're notoriously Melo is because they're faced with overwhelming evidence that day ain't shit.

Speaker 1:          02:41:00       Yes. You're sitting there looking out at the greatest like natural force that you could imagine. It's an entire different world. You're out there. Literally. It's like if we had explained it in a galactic term, it would be like your parking yourself next to the membrane between dimensions. I mean you are literally in this world over here and right next to your face is a whole nother world. Like we couldn't even imagine that, but that the fuck exactly what it is. Have you go. Like if you go to Santa Monica and you go over by where that peer as and you just walk along that sand and just start walking out into that water. You're in another world in like 20 steps. You're and you're over your head and you're in another dimension that you can't survive in. But to get the fuck back, it doesn't feel like you went to another planet, but you might as well have gone to another planet. Definitely. And it's right there. One of

Speaker 3:          02:41:52       my strongest experiences of diving was just to tell a little story, was dieting it off a tenor reef in the, in the Canary Islands. And I was down at a good 20 meters under water, let's say 70 feet. But there was a storm that day and the huge swell on the surface was so powerful that it was smashing me against the bottom of the sea. Oh my God, Bang, Bang, Bang. And I just, that moment I realized I am. I'm in the hands of a gigantic force, but I can do absolutely nothing about. There's nothing you can do the sea, the sea for me is a goddess. Fortunately I got over a lip and down into deeper water and it was okay for water. Yeah. Another 10 feet is what the fuck man. How long did you have to wait it out? That was another story. Um, we stayed down for about 20, 25 minutes. We then had to have to come up. We'd been working quite hard at depth that you get through, you get through your Ehr. But what we hadn't done was recky the exit point and when we surfaced in this heavy swell, it was extremely difficult to get out of the sea. The rocks came down quite steep and we discussed this before you. You came up at a different spot and it was bad. But anyway, here I am, I will tell the tale and

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       an older and wiser man. Greg Fitzsimmons is a terrifying. He's a good buddy of mine. Very funny. Standup comedian has a terrifying story. He was on vacation. He saw a woman drowning and he went out to save her and he realized that was hanging onto this woman's swim in back while his kids and his wife and everyone was on the shore. And he was like, Holy Shit. Like I'm trying to save someone hear sometimes when people try to say people, they get drowned. I know happens often. It happens often. Yeah, that's it. He said that the tide was a little bit too strong. Who's really spooky. Rip Tide. The sea is something to respect. Fuck yeah. Something. Something fast I had is that's a terrifying thing, but that's my favorite thing to one of my favorite things to do at the beach late at night by myself. Smoke a spliff.

Speaker 1:          02:43:51       Just stand out there and stare it by myself. Puts everything in perspective. It's just. It's like the ultimate. It's very psych, not just like a duck, but it's very isolation tank. Ask in a way. It's an overwhelming amount of information, but there's solitude and the sound and the noise that sort of drowns out the rest of the world doesn't totally drown it out like an isolation tank does, but it has a partial effect because you get. It's a moving but semi static image because it's these water waves that are coming at you and they're very similar, so get in this very similar thing over and over again with very little variation and then there's the overwhelming number, the gallons of water that's just so in front of you so you can't see past this fucking thing and it's dark. So then there's the unknown, the unknown, which is the big freaker. Know you're looking out this black monster and sometimes when it's this black monster, you get a better sense of it than when it's this beautiful blue thing during the day when the sun's hitting it. It's reflecting because you need to give all this visual stuff that's distracting you from the fact that south Florida water giant fuck load of water. It's right there. And he could just go, which, yeah, just come in like this and you're gone and everything's gone like a thousand fucking feet high waves. That's happened before. As

Speaker 3:          02:45:06       has happened before. That's also part of the new research that I'm doing and I'm about to do a trip with randall cardinal crosses being on your show. Love Him. Um, you know, randall was so far ahead of the curve in recognizing that the gigantic flooding that came off the North American ice cap wasn't just caused by what I used to think it was caused by, which is that lakes of meltwater develop on the surface of the ice cap. And finally, the dam, the dam breaks and the melt water pours out randomly pointing out for years that, uh, that the water flows were much too radical for that, something much bigger. I had to be had to be involved. So he was well ahead of the evidence when scientists began to realize that the North American ice cap had been hit by a comet 12,980 years ago. It was set in motion, the epoch, the geologist called the younger dryas. So run. And so randall is a great expert in this, in this area. My wife's sent this traveling with us as well, and a friend of Randall's who's worked with him for many years called Bradley. And we're going to do a road trip from Portland, Oregon,

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       all the way to Minneapolis, uh, following the, it's about 2000 miles, I believe, following the southern edge of the former ice cap. And Randall's going to show us the scars and tears on the landscape of what happened when that ice cap was instantly liquidized by a comet impact and huge tidal waves of water roared down, off it, across the land. Lord, going to see that, uh, in, in detail with Randall Real, looking forward to doing that. Also the first time I've ever crossed. Well, most of America by road. Um, I've always wanted to do that. Certain spots shouldn't stop. If you feel like you're in danger, you're in danger. Get in the car. I hit the gas. Yeah. And if you do you know what country music is. You've got to listen to some of that. Gets a hold of some country. You got to fit in, you got to blend in.

Speaker 4:          02:46:52       Can you fake southern accent? Because if they think you're from the England, I can do my best. But from the angland they won't like him and they want to get very upset if you go down better knows what are you dr who. The funny thing is in England, I often get mistaken for an American. Do you really? It's weird. You here nobody. Nobody's in any doubt once I am, but in England I'm officer American. Yeah. Or sometimes Canadian. Well, Canada has a bit of that. There's like a certain amount of English it sounds like in there, the way they talk about things in a certain, uh, clear variation between them and us. If there is definitely I even, I can hear that and I've got a 10 year. Can I, can. I can hear that too? Yeah. I can totally telecommute Canadian after awhile, but.

Speaker 4:          02:47:36       So similar. Yeah, very similar. Very similar. That's hilarious that anybody would ever think you're American. I know, I know. Anyway, it's going to be great. I'm really looking forward to this. Boy. That sounds fantastic. It's going to take loads and loads of pictures and we're going to go up in an airplane a few times and look at the look at the land underneath us and is going to be a great, exciting research trip and it's the last research trip for this cul that I'm writing to fingerprints. I'm sure you've seen this most recent discovery about micro diamonds. Yeah, that's exactly it. That's precisely. That is the, that has finally settled it. Any scientists who were attempting to argue that there wasn't a comedy impact. Now, with all the evidence that's come in over the last five or six years is just settled by the nano diamonds scattered in a huge swathe all over the world, which are assure, a chemical imprint of a massive comet impact, and they know a lot about it.

Speaker 4:          02:48:24       Now. It's really very, very clear, and this was an episode that changed the world, uh, it killed off the many of the megafauna that we've all heard of, the mammoth, the woody rhinos and so on and so forth, and it got rid of what was called the clovis culture. A hunter gather a culture in the United States. And I think it got rid of a whole civilization that we've only remembered in myth and memory. At least that's the line that I'm investigating. It's a fascinating line, especially when, as each visit that you come back to the podcast, there's new information. Last time it was the nuclear glass that they discovered when they were doing core samples again, which is about 12,000 years ago. Right? And then the new one is this micro diamonds. It seems like over and over again, this is not. It becomes not a possibility,

Speaker 3:          02:49:08       but a reality that there was some sort of an impact, something gigantic happened, but all over the world and right. It wasn't just all over the world. It was massive in America, but it was the effect was everywhere. Both impacts because this comment broke up into fragments like she would make a levy nine, both impacts, but also very important, the gigantic cloud of dust that's thrown up into the upper atmosphere, which then so you have this immediate reaction of flooding as the comment liquidiser as part of the North American ice cap. And then a huge dust plume is up in the air all over the world. And the whole earth is shrouded in dust as cool and cool because it's reflecting back the sun's rays. So we go into this 1,300, 1000, 400 year period called the younger Dryas, uh, where the earth gets incredibly cold even though previously it had been coming out of the, out of the ice is truly are gigantic event.

Speaker 3:          02:49:56       And then weirdly, all our history, everything we think of as our past begins at the end of the younger dryas around it kicks in 12,000, 980 years ago, ends 11,000, 600 years ago. The Earth begins to want, begins to warm up again and everything we know about ourselves or can claim we know unfolds in that last 11,000, 600 years and the period before the younger dryas, we really blank on so much of it. It's so fascinating. I send it again. Shit. It's amazing that all this information keeps coming up to support this. And it's amazing. If we do consider the possibility that it is true, that everything can be essentially shut back down to zero with some rocks from the sky and that that's something that we really need to get in our head that could happen there. There is a very distinct possibility that we could be hit by something. The NASA photographs of the, I think they call it the black diamond, the earth at night.

Speaker 3:          02:50:49       Okay. What you see is certain areas of the world a brightly lit up Europe, North America for example, on the other hand, Africa and large parts of South America are dark because there's no electrification in those areas and those photographs are often taken to say to speak of our achievement, look how we can light up the planet like a, like a Christmas tree, so that it can be viewed from viewed from space. But I would say it also says another thing that if we had, if we were to confront again the same sort of cataclysm that hit the earth 12,000, 980 years ago, then the people who would survive and carry the human story forward would be those very people who live in the dark areas, the areas that aren't electrified. And we who live in the glowing lights that show up on those NASA photographs who've become so specialized, who most of us are unable even to know how to plant a vegetable or, or, or hunt an animal. We're the ones who would, uh, who would be gone and the whole order of the world would be reversed. Whoa. So the world would become like an Arrow Oscar culture. You'd have all these fucking people from the Amazon. That would be fine because they're fed, they're fine, they'd be absolutely fine. They know how to survive, you know, they know, they know how

Speaker 4:          02:52:06       to do it. So again, I think the message of this is we shouldn't be arrogant and complacent in the achievements of our civilization. We have done wonderful and amazing things as well as terrible things, but we shouldn't be arrogant or complacent about it. We should recognize it's all very fragile. It can be taken away from us at anytime. We can take it away from ourselves without a doubt. The information is something to consider. Just the information about these, these impacts. It's something to consider and it's also something to consider that if that's correct, for what a magical time it must have been back when they had developed some sort of technology that was enabling them to make structures like go Beckley tap is why I'm magicians of the gods because there's something magical. Something about it that we would, we would call magic perhaps was just another another form of science.

Speaker 4:          02:52:57       Well, yeah, whatever they were able to do. I mean, it's amazing that we haven't figured it out yet, but we're so arrogant in our assumptions that it had to be all the ways that we've already figured out. He's so silly, like isn't there some shit we haven't figured out exactly like this new, this new ability to. They've just found out that they've taken people and they've used the internet to send information for more person's mind or another person saying that 5,000 miles away. It's incredible, but nobody else did that before that and so we didn't really think that that was. We thought maybe it'd be a possibility, but now we know it's possibility. Whatever the fuck they did to make these pyramids like just because we haven't figured it out yet, it doesn't mean that we're using wooden rollers, like they could have had some really incredible technology that we don't have a trace of it anymore.

Speaker 4:          02:53:40       We're looking at a full of technology that we don't recognize as exactly because we're. We're programmed thinking about entirely on our own terms and it's almost like the universe is giving us a puzzle that so incredibly in your face with its most obvious results and because because we have these preconceived notions that we're not willing to accept that as a possibility. Like when people look at the pyramids, they go, well, you know, the thing is they build ramps and they use stone rowers and like there's a whole faction who will look for the most boring, meaningless might've, but they might've done it, but they might've done that. But the fact that that there are large groups of people whose mission is to look for the most boring rather than the most extraordinary possibility. It's good. That's how we have bonds in our society. We do need to look.

Speaker 4:          02:54:26       We do need to look with a skeptical eye and say that there could be mundane explanations for this, but we also need to keep a tiny fraction of our research effort. Perhaps a very small fraction indeed to exploring alternative alternative ideas. Because every night if they do come out right, they change everything in the way that the mundane things don't and it's really worthwhile and the only thing I'm understand why I've been subjected to so much criticism and I welcome it, I've I've learnt a great deal from that criticism, but is it wise for us to live in a society which is hostile to the exploration of extraordinary possibilities? Shouldn't we actually protect

Speaker 1:          02:55:04       that and make that something which, which we encourage those who wish to do so in our society to do just on the off chance that they might come up with something utterly world changing, especially if it's done with careful consideration like you've done or especially like with Randall Crawson's done with asteroidal impacts is absolutely stunning and fascinating. I mean, and what he's done is done with very careful consideration. Absolutely rattles real. He's a real scholar, real thorough researcher and investigator and he was awesome. And the podcasts wasn't one of my all time favorites. Right? Yet these, these ideas are fascinating, but what I was gonna say was that it's almost like the number is so large, like 2 million, 300,000 stones in the Great Pyramid, which is so bizarre. The numbers in tons. Yeah. The number of 50 to 70 tons roofing. The king's chamber elevated to heights of 300 feet above the ground.

Speaker 1:          02:55:51       It's almost perfectly aligned to true north, south, east and West within a fraction of a single degree. You know, so crazy that the like if they could come back from, from the past and if they come to our time today and go, wait a minute, how did you guys think we did that? You think we use slaves? Oh my God. That's so funny. Yeah, yeah. You've got to come over here, man. Tell him, tell him how you think we made the pyramids. Slaves on would get the fuck out of here. Yeah, exactly. Like laughing like you guys haven't invented this magneto thing yet and it's something that allows you to turn to you turn things with staff with sound. Yeah. You don't know how to manifest things out of the air. I don't know how to exercise the majestic and incredible power of your mind just running out of time.

Speaker 1:          02:56:35       We are unfortunately running out of time. Can I say it again? Yes, please. Because I am a big playlist. Please, please, if anybody out there we'd like to take me up on this offer. Just go to Graham Hancock.com. Go to the war God page, which you'll find easily. Scroll down and see what to write to me, but I have to repeat again. I will send you the book plates, but I can't correspond. Correspond and it will be November before I'm in a position to send the book plates because I'm on the road continuously until the 27th Graham Hancock Dot Com. Graham Hancock Dotcom. I. My goal is to make this so successful that you never make another offer ever again. I wanna I wanna ruin you. You can't sign all these things. Too many coming in and you're like, what the fuck am I doing? Why Am I.

Speaker 1:          02:57:18       I can't do this. This is my whole life now, so now it's. This would be the last one. I think it'll probably be the last one. By the way, this. There's chapters to read free online on the [inaudible] page as well, so I'm not asking people to buy sight unseen. They can have a look beautiful and your book, fingerprints of the Gods. I've said it before when you've been on the podcast for changed my single handedly changed my ideas about history, changed my ideas, not just not in any way discounting the amazing work that traditional traditional historians have done, but just that these things exist that defy explanation and that I didn't know. Just the fact that there is a guy from Boston University named Robert Shaw who's a prominent geologists who said this is clear erosion and there was last time there was rosie was 9,000 BC, like you're talking about. An insane amount of time has passed since there was thousands of years of that rain fall. By the way, you needed thousands of years to do what we see on this. This isn't wind like this is some crazy shit and that's what I try to do.

Speaker 3:          02:58:12       Fingerprints was to bring together people like John Anthony West who brought Robert show up to this fixate, Robert Duvall, like random rose, phlegm, math, a lot of researchers who were working in the field and coming out with extraordinary information and part of what I did in that book was was to bring all that information together into a kind of synthesis. I suppose

Speaker 1:          02:58:27       it's such an interesting theory and it's such an interesting subject and now that it seeps getting substantiated by places like go Beckley, tappy or these micro meteors that sort of piece the puzzle together. Slowly but surely, I think as time goes on, we're going to find there's going to be a bunch of civilizations that we uncover those ones that are finding in Mexico, and then of course there's ones that they're finding in the Amazon with a thing just like we were talking about the other. They find a hill and they think it's a hill, and then someone realized. I was like, Holy Shit, this is a. This is a building guys.

Speaker 3:          02:58:55       Huge earthworks in the Amazon stone circles. You know? That's another place to look for a lost civilization.

Speaker 1:          02:59:01       We're out of time. That's it, right? Or we're dying. We're dying. How much time we have. It's counting down. How much time give me seconds. Less than a man. Alright. Thank you. Thank you Graham. Hancock sponsors. Thanks to me undies. Thanks to Tim and uh, thanks to draft kings.com. Go there and do that and use those codes that were all earlier. Send them earlier. Just fucking rewind that. Uh, but thank you also to everybody tuning into this podcast and thanks for all the positive feedback and everything. Go to Graham Hancock.com, Graham Hancock Dot com and order the book. Thank you sir. Appreciate it. Thanks Joe. It's been fun. Say Bye. Good bye everybody.
