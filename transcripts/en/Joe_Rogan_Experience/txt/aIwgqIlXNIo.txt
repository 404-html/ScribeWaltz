Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Oh, I won't. That means we're on. So I'm, I'm multitasking Greg Proops that's what kind of podcast or I am. I love that monkey noise though. Cause that to me alerts me to many things are happening at once. The jungle is full of activity. That's how you got to look at it. You really have to look at it that way. It's like you got to make a positive out of it. Always. The natives are restless, you know, we think it's cute. But in reality if you heard that fucking noise, he'd be terrified. If you're out there in the jungle and you hear it might be some mother fucker ready to jump on you bite your dick or it's me. That's creepy. Right before you buy it is creepy. If it was just you in the woods, I'd be like, oh, what's up dude? Yeah, that'd be the end of it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       If it was a monkey in the woods, man, he'd be fighting for your fucking life. Monkeys are terrifying. And I was in Barbados once and they have green monkeys. Yes. To call it green monkey. Ja, they threw shit. You know, my wife and I were like walking through the parking lot of the hotel and all of a sudden a giant branch falls next to us and I'm like, really? And you look up and they're like, yeah, fuck you. I know you don't care how much you, they're kind of Douchey. Yeah. They killed a guy in India recently, a mayor of a town. It was a, I don't know what happened, but he got swarmed by monkeys and they killed him. Like that can happen. And in Gibraltar, the apes are attacking people to Christ. Greg Proops. You know, it's like that movie James Franco was riot man.

Speaker 1:          00:01:20       James Franco's always right. Well the gym, so I could be wrong about just James Franco was always right. Uh, you could, how about you fucking make James Franco's are always right.com. Thank. Go to squarespace.com make your own website for it. Set up an online store. Started selling. James Franco was always right. Tee shirts. It's no disrespect to James Franco. This is not parody. This is just saying that this is not a parody. We're not being assholes here. We like you. I just, you know that fucking movie man, while he was right, the apes are taking over. I watched the staying on, uh, uh, I don't know. I think it was PBS where they, they was showing baboons and Africa. People were just simply tried to go to the supermarket, but baboons new now gotten hip to the jive that there was food to be had at the parking lot and they were just rolling people for their bags of groceries, kicking their ass and take a minute to think scarier than about them because they're like a tiger mixed with a monkey or whatever. Horrible teeth. They'll jump on you. They fight in packs and they organized their like highly intelligent dogs. Like they get up on too and like, it's just mortifying. You're watching like a lady with two grocery bags and about the and just fucking, and you're like, I would, I would never stop screaming. And that's what it feels like to go to John's instead of Vaughn's. Yeah. Been there. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:02:40       they don't have, we can't afford an age remorse. Like, oh, they have no problem killing you mean anything to them? Like our idea of like what's fair and what's not fair, what we expect and don't expect. It's thrown out the window with wild animals, especially wild animals that get too used to people. That's why they have a real problem with like bears that live in and start tacking the garbage. Then they, that becomes a source of food. Like period. They don't ever quit and then they run into people and all kinds of crazy shit can happen, especially if they have kids. It's not that Boone morality that him to just informs everything in nature that I protest most vehemently. Very smart to God. Three Smart Fox. How about the meatball? The bear was it who was going into houses? Uh, and like he found me. Paul's in the freezer.

Speaker 1:          00:03:23       They're like our key in me. Paulson was just like eating them and sitting in the hot tub and shit. Holy Shit. No. People come home and find bears on their couch watching TV and stuff with their weed. You know, like there's really, it's like you say though, they, they don't, it's a pattern to them. You know what I mean? They know Tuesday, Tuesday night there's going to be pizzas. I'm coming down and I'm meeting them or not. It doesn't even matter if it's Tuesday, it's, they're going to keep checking your house over and over and over again. If they find out that there was garbage there, once it becomes a source of food, right. And they have to shoot him, it gets real or they have to take on and bring them to zoos. Squares my soccer.

And we're also block brought to you by law to you today by hulu.com now with Hulu plus. This is our first, uh, Hulu, uh, commercial. Apparently Hulu is pretty fucking bad ass. I've heard about it for years. Um, people, uh, you know, watch different shows on it. I never exactly knew what it did though, until uh, I started paying attention recently and lets you watch thousands of hit shows you can, you have Hulu plus, right?

Speaker 2:          00:06:34       Yeah, I have it on my Xbox. Do you use it? Uh, you know, I, I, I've had it for a while and it's one of the things I always forget that I have and because it's not that expensive. So like when you pay for it, you're like, it's one of those, Oh, I forgot I, I subscribed to this. Oh, I should watch it sometime. But when I do, I usually just watch. I should let a family guys, when I just want to sit there and watch a, I have family. I'm really stupid. I just like, you know, South Park family guy and a couple other things.

Speaker 4:          00:06:57       When you get Outta here, you don't want no thinking. Yeah. I don't know. I don't understand that. You're not watching the four, the three tenors or whatever it is, or Celtic woman ever. Sarah Brightman what are those things? Those are all the PBSC DVDs they offer. When you flipped by, you know, the PBS channels where people go to the Cerritos Arts Center to see a thing, right. It's always the, it's always a classical music. There's some group with four good looking dudes and they're called Il something. Someone will write you, I'm sure if you, uh, and then, uh, the Celtic woman has like five hot looking Irish girls who wear long dresses and they go, Yep, Yep. And you know, single Celtic. And then there's Sarah Brightman who was Andrew Lloyd Webber's a wife years ago. Does this like mystical, which deal? But in theaters, you know, so like it's for regular people, it's not for witches.

Speaker 4:          00:07:45       Wow. And you know, she hung the moon comes up and shit and I'm like, Sarah Brightman after midnight or whatever. And it's like, she was a musical comedy star basically. He found the shtick doing like kind of Demi Golf music for people who don't really like classical. You know what I mean? It's like you're not smooth. Jazz is for people who don't actually liked jazz, they just want something in the background and it's got a saxophone in it. Then went to sedate them. You know, like they don't want to fuck, they don't want jazz. They didn't wanna listen to Charlie Parker who still have a heart attack. The smooth jazz can push you to accelerate into traffic as new jobs every day. It will suck the zest out of life. Yeah. When you hear him smooth jazz version of like a Michael Jackson Song from 1978 [inaudible] you'll be like, this isn't making it happen as much as it might. How often do people get to listen to music at work? I think if they let you have the radio on, uh, it's probably one of those commercial, a crappy stations or top 40 shit where they can guarantee no one's going to say something screwy. Or if everyone agrees and everyone's the same age, I'm guessing like an oldies station like k or if there's something to, it was just going to be sunny and share all day or whatever. When I went back anyway,

Speaker 2:          00:08:54       they had a CD, it

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       was like an hour long and it just repeated. I hate for like six months at a time would get, oh we get a new CD and then they, we're like, oh, on this top, something that lives inside me like an Armadillo and is waiting to burst out the music at the lax airport in every single restaurant there are bar hard rock in the morning and stuff like journey and shit. And I mean, when I say hard rock on me and like classic, you know, I mean, can we take it down a notch? And then Christmas carols start, sometimes the Christmas was killed. Channel come on accidentally at lax and just be on for a while and you're like, what the fuck? And they'll go, it's on a computer or whatever. And you're like, wow, that's kind of unacceptable since we're trapped,

Speaker 3:          00:09:36       it's kind of fucked up to play something that's sucks. Like if you walked in and there's some thrash metal,

Speaker 4:          00:09:41       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:09:46       I would be like, oh, come on Dick. Right. This is a donut shop. But if I went to a skateboard shop and it was like 8:00 PM would accept,

Speaker 2:          00:09:54       we go to Abercrombie and Fitch and he, we walk in there and it's so loud and you just want to look at sweaters or something and it's like when they hit you with that fucking stinky, the air, what kind of weirdness

Speaker 3:          00:10:06       that where they, they don't accept the way reality smells. They must spray some chemicals in your face that you know are not good for you

Speaker 2:          00:10:14       and pumps shitty music in your ears that really, really gay thoughts. It's fucking shaving down hairless dude's all sleek and slim and I'm in love with this but on Hulu you can, there's this show called Chicago fire and I'm in love with this girl right here and she just started following me on Twitter. Her name's Laura and German. Laura German. That has nothing to do. We're just talking about, yeah, Hulu because he didn't see her stalker and a that shows on who? The CDC. That's cool. If you want to watch the show with her though, because you can go back a season and you could watch the whole season, like the first season and there is limited commercials on it, but I think it's only seven 99. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:10:53       it's seven, seven, nine nine a month. You could stream as many TV shows and movies you want whenever you want. Um, it's great way to, to access. Also, they have new content too. They have Hulu originals, originals, Hulu originals are doing now. The awesome starring Snl Seth Meyers and a moon boy starring Chris O'Dowd from bridesmaids. So they're starting to do their own content just like sorta like Netflix is doing, which is pretty bad ass. I love that people are doing that. I love seeing this new progression. You know, I haven't watched that Netflix show with Kevin Spacey, House of Wizard, his carts. I heard it's fucking incredible. Yeah, I keep hearing it's fucking incredible. There was an English version. It was really good. Now he's a bad motherfucker. Anyway. Um, Hulu plus go there, check it out. Laura German by all kinds of shit. She thinks the world of you, man. Go to Hulu plus.com forward. Slash. Rogen. Yeah. She's in love with and to

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       anyways. This is a good show. If you like fires like I don't watch much. You like fires. No Book of matches. This show rules. If you're inspired by the ancient elements, it's, it's really cool. I actually don't want to shows. I got into this. It's good. It's like er, but in fact about fires. What's it called again? A Chicago fire. Its second season right now. Just started. It's Microstar. That's my buddy. Yeah, it's a big guy right there. He was on a show called hardball with me, sweetheart of a guy who was in Goodfellows gets A's in a thousand movie. The bodyguard. He played the guy that Kevin Costner gotten the craziest fight and the bodyguard and super, Super Nice Guy. One of the nicest guys I've ever met and hold on, I was sitting there. Yeah, that's the guy from sticking to the city right there. You know the one guy that [inaudible] how would you know Josh?

Speaker 1:          00:12:35       You have a penis. What's wrong with that statement? Miss Charlotte Guy. I liked Charlotte too. Yeah. Anyway, go to Hulu Plus Hulu plus Ford.

Speaker 5:          00:14:02       Well, good experience Joe Rogan podcast. My night all day.

Speaker 1:          00:14:09       Good. Google the Mowgli. Greg Proops. Holla. Hey Baby. What's going on brother? Uh, everything. I can't even begin to stop it a camp again now everything's going on, Eh, it's, it's a nice day today. I'm excited to be out here. I don't get to woodland hills is, can I say where we're broadcasting from? Is it an undisclosed location? Undisclosed location. But you fucked that up, so wow. You get real specific Tarzana area and uh, so, uh, yeah, no, it's nice to be on earth with you, man. It's nice to be on earth with you as well. All rotating around the smartest man in the world podcast. That's the one that, that guy's name, the guy couldn't get the name right. Yeah, no. Right. It's a hard one man in the room. It's difficult to remember. Yeah. The smartest

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       guy in the room. Yeah. That one. Cause there was, I think a documentary of that and Ron that was called the smartest guys in the room. Yeah. Yeah. You don't want to be connected to that creepy shit. Now I down, I watched that documentary. That wasn't it again. Very strange. Yeah. It only makes sense though, you know, I don't understand finances, but the corruption of finances only makes sense to me. So a movie like Enron or it turns out the bunch of dudes just fucking robbed everybody blind. Yeah, I guess that's what you rolling brownouts they get crazy. Yeah. They try to figure out more ways to make money. But that's always the way it is. If you allow people to make the insane amounts of money. And I'm not saying you shouldn't, I'm not, I'm not, you know, I'm not necessarily a socialistic in any way, but if you allow people to get to that billion, trillion, that, that fucking insane amount of influence level.

Speaker 3:          00:15:42       Woo. That's slippery. That gets really crazy. We'll look at the world. I mean, that's what's going on right now. That's why the government is closed and shit. Exactly. It's why the government's close. It's why there's war. It's all these big groups because as individuals, because you imagine if the world consisted, is only individuals where there was only like a few people on the planet and you know, Russia was like, listen, we're going to go into Afghanistan and we're going to take your shit. And Afghanistan was like one guy and he's like, what are you talking about man? And Russia was like one guy, like, why are you here? Like what are you doing man? You got your spot. I got my spot. What the fuck's going on? Because I want your spot too, man. But because there's so many people, then there becomes this weird diffusion of responsibility where we can somehow or another, even in this day and age still justify all the crazy shit that we do.

Speaker 3:          00:16:31       You mean like sending bombs around the world by remote control all that? Yeah, absolutely. That's really freaky. You know, there's, there's some numbers you know, that, uh, are very disputed about, we were talking about on the podcast, like some sources say that 98% of the people that are killed are civilians and then other people are saying, well, the reality is that the census is there are not that good. It's not that easy to tell how many people were killed. They'll exaggerate. There's a lot of lying going on. There's a lot of, a lot of, um, misinformation that comes back and forth from both sides. But like either way, even if it's not 98%, he, how about it? Let's make it 2% 2% innocent. It's pretty fucked up. And the other 98%, what exactly are they guilty of? You know, what exactly are you doing where you think it's okay to launch missiles through the air? It's like some shit that we don't exactly know. You know, we, we assume they're really, really bad guys. We have to take off this earth because they're involved in terror plots. Okay. I believe that, you know, it's possible that that could be going on. It could be going on, but shit, that's a crazy way to go. And if a bunch of people are near you, tough shit. Yeah. I think for them it's a more economical way than sending an army. And it also plays to all the defense contractors because kind of shit they have

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       to use for that's most high tech and most expensive. And it can, it's just like everything else in life. It's like just how the, you know, the early days of Samurai, I didn't want to adopt the gun and it was proved very costly. Like the, we were always moving forward, especially with weapons and these, it's inevitable. Didn't you see Malala said to Obama yesterday when you say that she said the Predator drones are creating terrorism. Yeah, I would imagine there were the, our terror, the terror from the sky, absolute terror. There's many definitions of terror and won a state operated terror. And that's what that is. Yeah. And it's, there's this, that the idea that it's somehow or another protecting us. I get that, you know, I get that and I want to believe that. I really do. It's a huge violation of the Geneva Convention. If anyone cares about the Geneva convention anymore, it says explicitly you mustn't kill innocent children.

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       Yeah. They're not trying to, I guess, you know, I don't know what the fuck is really going on. Obviously I'm not there, but the idea of it as just a complete objective person, like looking at it from the outside, it's so science fictiony it's so, or William. It's so weird. It seems like something from a horror movie like from like 20 years ago, a horror movie about the future, but it's just like the terminator, right? I mean it's not happening here. Pinpoint, but he could, shit, man, that's, technology starts to evolve. People are going to want revenge for things that have been done to their communities and that's where it gets fucking crazy. They're actually talking about launching blimps and to the air to protect from missile attacks. Oh God. Like World War One when they'd put a bunch of blimps up to fog the Yankees.

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       Christ. Yeah. Wow. You hear all this crazy talk and you're like, Jesus Christ. How about everybody just work this shit out? Do people really want to take those kinds of risks and kill that many people and isn't it possible you guys can just settle the fuck down and everybody just talk things through? Mm. Not Currently, but it might happen one day. Right. There's been, uh, some years of peace in the last 500 years. What about a couple of 25 30 years? I don't know if there really has been, have there ever in the world, not in the world. I've mean, I've read statistics like that and different magazines where they'll say like in the last 500 years there's been cumulative 20 something. I don't know how they pieced together the years of peace within. That means one whole year in a row or with a part of a year and two weeks here and two weeks there.

Speaker 1:          00:20:16       It doesn't seem like there's been peace ever since I've been alive. Yeah. I don't think there's ever been piece. If you, you're thinking about worldwide. I grew up with Vietnam. Yeah. I mean, even if you just kind of America because after Vietnam then, well, yeah, worldwide it was V it never stops. Well, there's always been some creepy shit going on. Even when we weren't at war. I mean, and we learned about the Oliver North trial and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and all that shit back when Reagan was in office and we didn't really know what was going on until that was coming out. Yeah, and also there we were involved you, we were involved

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       in all sorts of military shit. Even when we weren't officially at war. Like though I'm getting pain and they gotta get paid and they got to get paid off. That was a drug. Drugs and money. Drugs too, for sure. And most likely drugs right now. And people don't want to admit that, but it is so obvious. It's ridiculous. They have poppy fields everywhere. They increased the amount of heroin they grow, the u s invaded and increase that. Yeah, I mean I get it. I'm not saying you shouldn't make money selling heroin. Wasn't it the same thing in Vietnam with the Golden Triangle though? Yes. Basically it her one profit making organism. No one wants to believe that. And that's a problem. The problem is that a lot of people are averse to disturbing information. They don't want to believe it. They don't want to believe that at the highest levels of government.

Speaker 3:          00:21:40       Some of them must be selling some shit. If you the government and you knew like it's almost like a public safety thing to have the government sell in the coke and them being the big dealers rather than some crazy guy, at least the government, you know, they probably have some fucking rules as to how they're going to deal with a, their competitors and how they're going to handle things. I wonder, I mean it's, well that brings me to the metal, the medical marijuana question because having just been in Canadia and and Jan van and a Washington, you know, on the one hand I'm all for them being able to sell pot, but on the other hand you're getting the government involved and that, oh, it's a little frightening to me. Unless you can get the government high and then get them involved, then it would work out.

Speaker 3:          00:22:30       That really is the only hope. I know that sounds so stupid, but the only hope for this culture that we have right now is that people get high and take another look and go, wait a minute, what are we doing? Get. I somehow get get high through yoga if you don't want to smoke weed, but if you do want to smoke weed, the best thing to do is to smoke weed. Don't fuck around. Dive right in and don't be a bitch. Take a look at this thing. This thing is crazy. This is a crazy, crazy world that doesn't make any sense to anybody and no one stops and goes, hold up. Why do we keep doing it this way? Why are we keep doing this? Why are we keep doing the same shit? It's been fucking up our ancestors. Why? What do we deal with in detail?

Speaker 3:          00:23:16       I don't want to kill you. You don't need to kill me. Let's talk this man shit out. That's the thing. I've never had any anything against any of the countries we've been at war with in my entire lifetime at never thought to myself, God dammit fucking Iraq. What was, you know, it never really affected us personally. No. Except people who lost friends and loved ones of course. And that will actually went over there. But yeah, it was too easy. It's too easy starting these things. I mean stunning them. You know what's too easy when you don't feel anything, you know when you're over here, we don't, it's, it's a human being as used to accepting the risks and rewards in its own environment. The other shit outside your environment is just so fake. It's so abstract. It's so hard to wrap your head around the Great Wall of China.

Speaker 3:          00:24:03       There's people on the Great Wall of China, right? And they're walking around and what, what are you talking about? Like that's going on right now on the other part of the world. It doesn't seem, I don't feel that here. So when bombs are dropping in Afghanistan and Iraq war in Pakistan through drones, it feels like nothing over here. It feels just like someone walking the Great Wall of China. If we're too detached, we don't, we're not getting the impact. If we were in the community, would see the fear and talk to him. They were terrified and talk to people, lost loved ones because these bad guys are camping out in the same town as you. It's terrifying. Terrifying Shit. I think we are, we're just so far away from it. We're getting the information, but we're so far away. It just doesn't seem real. Now. There's a huge disconnect and I think in the public discourse and even bigger disconnect because of that, I think people have it feelings and people have emotions so people know what's going on.

Speaker 3:          00:24:57       But I think that that, that emotional disconnect as a, as a huge Malays that's gotten worse, I think in the last few years. I think you're right. I think the economic pressure on top of it and the disconnection and the fact that it's become clear that the really, really wealthy, you know, it's going to be this way. They're not really willing to budge on it for the moment. And uh, yeah. And there's only one way to stop that. You have to put a cap on how much money someone can have. And that just doesn't seem right either. Well, no, we can't do that. That's like saying you have to have all the guns back tomorrow. That's not going to happen either. Yeah, that's it. That's it. That's even less possibly out because you know, I think it would be easier almost to put a cap on how much money you can make as long as it was just a preposterous cap.

Speaker 3:          00:25:42       I'm not even, I'm not even adverse to people making money. I would simply like them to pay their fair share of the fucking, you know, rent on that raggedy motherfucker that's so big to me. I really wished that I trusted where it all went, but I think it's very important to me to pay up. Like there was a time when I was a kid, why didn't pay taxes for like shit, it was like a year or something like that. Yeah. I didn't pay taxes for you. I was just broke. It was just too broke. And then when I got some money then I've got an account and paid all my back taxes. I just was, I was barely getting by as a comedian. But I felt like such a loser. I felt like, like when I wasn't paying my taxes, I felt like a scrounge. I felt like if you in the principle of taxes, I'm not saying that they go to the right use and I'm not saying that I agree with it, but with with its decisions that our government makes. But I think that I've, I very much agree with the idea of everyone contributing to the community. And I think that if it was managed really nicely, if it was a really like healthy police force filled with nice, who are

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       just trying to help out. And the same thing with governors, the governors, if they were really healthy and nice people, we're just trying to really expand the community and not be influenced by special interest groups that want them to allow certain poisons to be stored in her holes in the ground and shit. If they weren't influenced by that, then I would feel even better about it. I would really be happy about my contribution to our community. I think it's super important to pay taxes on turning you down to that, you know? No, I'm fine with, did you turn yourself down? I think I did. I think it is too, but I think it's like you said, there's just too much coopting going on in the system. And uh, I mean, well it's too big. The, the, the problem I have is that the richest people want to keep talking about John and government and stopping government because governments evil cause governments this big boondoggle that people are sponging off of, but they're the ones sponging off of it and then they don't give any, they don't pay any taxes because they avoid it and you think, well fuck you.

Speaker 1:          00:27:36       You're not giving in and you're not helping out on the other end and you want to take away poor people's allotments and poor people aren't taking all the money away. Like if everybody that was a giant corporation paid their taxes, there'd be plenty of money floating around. Yeah. But the problem is it's not just how much money comes in. The real problem then becomes what happens with that money. Who's handling this? Who's, who's setting up organizations? Yeah, honey. Exactly. I mean, that's where our real problem gets what, $600 billion a year or something. Oh Shit. They just go, I'll take that pitch. Yeah. They get the right thing. Yeah. They just backhand us and then us getting across the floor on her ass, try to start a little health care and everybody has a fucking heart attack all up in this place. I am so ignorant when it comes to this Obama care thing.

Speaker 1:          00:28:25       I tried to pay attention to it and I tried to read up on it, but my add kicked in hard. Yeah. It's perplexing. It's, there's two issues. One, the one that's really weird is that it's already a law. Yes. Correct. Okay. So the Supreme Court, so what the fuck, what are these guys doing? Like how can you like resist a law? Well, and that's not the way to resist a law. That sounds like you think that your ideas are more important. Well, let me give you a, uh, a bad analogy. And the 1870s after the civil war, that was a big election between Tilden and Hayes. And, uh, it got thrown like the Gore Bush one, right? It was a lot of chick cannery, a lot of jiggery pokery and a lot of vote fucking rolling and dad people on the rolls and shit. And rather than throw it to the Supreme Court, they put a three man panel together who put it down in Hayes favor.

Speaker 1:          00:29:16       Well, children was more of a reformer in Hayes wasn't. And so Jim crow was allowed to flourish after his administration. Jim Crow was against the law of the land because those laws had been put in the constitution. Even black men got the right to vote that they were no longer property when they were no longer slaves. All of those things are laws. So it's like, well, they did it anyway. They made bathroom segregated and restaurant segregated on the country segregated. And they just fucking did it. And like right now, they don't want the affordable healthcare act. They don't want whatever Obama, they're unhappy with whatever the agenda is. They're simply stopping it because they can, uh, constituted not constitutionally that, you know, organizationally within the, the rules of order, they're allowed to pull this shit. And uh, I think it's the same thing. There was no point it ruined the country then that Jim crow got in.

Speaker 1:          00:30:12       Cause if they'd kept it the way it was supposed to, there was lots of black congress people after the civil war in the south and they were all republicans cause that was the party of abolition. And then that turned, and so they that weren't having that after there was a dozen of them, looks like, let's not have that anymore. She had many black men speaking their mind from Alabama. And so they, uh, you know, went back to miscegenation laws, Jim Crow woman. And I feel like this is the same thing in a very poor metaphorical way. Like the Trayvon Martin case was a case of a person standing their ground. And you know, like those laws, those laws are an extension of the slave patrols when you didn't want black people wandering around at night and they simply weren't allowed to. And men gathered and rode around and fucking rounded them up and shit like that.

Speaker 1:          00:30:58       That's where those laws came from. If it's from the same time period after the civil war and during the civil war, before the civil war, the ancient ancient law, then it's a, it's as it's as, it's as old fashioned as white guys having a fucking whiskey after work, uh, on the plantation. And I was under the impression that this stand, your ground law was fairly recent. It is. I'm just saying the antecedent to it, the, what precedes it is, uh, uh, hundreds of years have, let's make sure the undesirable people aren't in our neighborhood after dark. And by doing that, you've extended it technically, as you know, that jury ruled the way they were told to rule. They didn't go out of their way to find George Zimmerman innocent whenever they, the judge said, you've got to go by the letter of this law and underneath all the Pr, you know, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:41       I'm not a lawyer, nor do I play one on TV. I'm just an asshole with a big opinion. There's like almost every case. There's so much involved in it. For an outsider like you or I to say that we know what happened. I always think that's so crazy and no one knows what happened on the night. And when I do know, I do know that it probably wouldn't have happened with a different kind of person. Like if there's certain people she'd be sure there's certain people that can handle things socially, altercations and then certain people who are really poor communicators and they cause a lot of like a lot of issues communicating with people and then their arguments and sue that might not necessarily have had to and might not have if some cool dude who's like the security patrol guy. What's going on man? Everything cool.

Speaker 1:          00:32:31       Just got some skittles. I'm going, yeah, that's it. Like nice, friendly, you know, maybe it, maybe this dude had been fucked with too times by too many dickheads asking him questions and he was like, yeah, fuck you. And he had built up, you know, did you see the Kanye West Jimmy Kimmel interview? I did not. It was pretty interesting. And Kanye West was super honest about it. You know, they have this big Twitter fight. And one of the things Kanye West said was like, all these people were attacking him. And so he had built up and then he'd just exploded on the one person that he actually knew that it was totally, you know, it's this disproportionate reaction that, but it was just the same kind of thing. It was just build up that does, didn't have an outlet and then boom. Then it just goes all into that.

Speaker 1:          00:33:15       Yeah. Now, and I think you're right that, uh, George Zimmerman was riding around, probably spoiling a little bit for fight, and he was clearly huffy about guys in the neighborhood and shit. And you know, I mean, in the end it could also could be, he's just a neighborhood watch guy and he's trying to do his thing and there's a lot of shady people in the neighborhood that's also possible. Could be, he could be, that's been a black community for a hundred years. But I'm saying there's still a lot of criminals still. A lot of kids should just not saying just because it's a black community doesn't mean it's crime Britain. No, but the big thing is that he, there was a lot of breakins and that area, right. So he was, yeah. Yeah. And He'd, he'd had run INS with guys before. I think that thing is, that's even more, you know, over arching than his, you know, reaction on the night to fucking shoot somebody was as a, which is horrible and tragic, but uh, it's like what, what it did in a, in a, in almost a Rodney king or Oj waiting the country to really be like a thunderclap that just fucked everybody over.

Speaker 1:          00:34:13       And you know, again, pointing out the inequity that there's two sets of laws, one for the underclass and one for everybody else and that, you know, nothing's fair and, and the racial divide and it, it's just something that I thought it was really destructive, like as an emotional. Also the media of course, you know, amped it up to insane levels, but it's true. And it's also something we're fighting through. I think even with this shutdown, I think is a, if you'll look at the teams, you know, there's a racial element to this that's undeniable, that carries through in everything since this country was born. Well, do you think that if he was some white trash kid that was in the neighborhood, some, uh, angry white dude with like love and hate, tattooed on his knuckles and Zimmerman shot him, do think they're same thing would've happened?

Speaker 1:          00:35:01       I don't know. I think he might've been acquitted still because of the, of the law, the letter of that law. It, he was in his defense and I'm not a Zimmerman apologist. And I, as I said, I'll be super clear. Um, I was not there. I don't know what happened. I would not say I know what happened. I don't know. I do know that Zimmerman's face was fucked up. And I do know he had cuts in the back of his head from his head being bounced off the ground. So he was getting his ass kicked. And I, I've gotten my ass kicked before. It's a terrifying fee. Atis. And, um, if he was getting his ass kicked and this guy was in danger of hurting

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       him, that's the whole, the whole reason the law exists. Yes. You should be able to defend yourself with a gun because without a gun, you're at the mercy of this asshole's beating the shit out of you. Right. I'm not saying that he didn't instigate the fight. He's going to sit and take the gray area comes with what proceeded. Sure. Fracas he could die there. That's make no mistake about it. Yeah. It's pretty easy for someone to die in a street fight. Oh hell yeah. It is. Especially with concrete is going to say, as soon as your head hits the fucking streets, super easy to get knocked out. Super easy to fall down, smash your head and never be the same again. Like it's really scary scenario. So if you are a fighting this kid who's like in better shape than you, he's kicking your fucking ass.

Speaker 3:          00:36:14       Like you're in danger of dying. Like that's real. Like your life is essentially in his hands. He might punch a few times when you're out and walk away or he might stomp you to death. He could do that if he wants to. It's up to him and he's, he's so enraged that you're in a physical altercation with your bodies where you're fighting for your life to the point where you have to pull a gun out. Well, I think that the pointless, like he's not a policeman and he challenged to this guy and you know, do we know that? See, I don't know what exactly. So that's the problem. So I'm not, I'm not making any, there wasn't a police call and all that jazz, unless that didn't happen according to the, the police call definitely happened. But what's interesting about the police call that happened was that they edited it.

Speaker 3:          00:36:56       They asked you what does he look like? And he said he's a black guy. But when they played it on the air, they edited it. So they cut out the woman we Lorraine's question. So they changed it. Here's this guy looks suspicious, he's a black guy. So they edited out the question. They made it look like he was pointing out that he's a black guy. He thinks about it. The media was never said July did all of a sudden they were, they, no, no one's going to support it again for a couple of weeks. No one's innocent in this. No one's innocent in this. Of course, the number one tragedies that this guy lost his life. I try to tell young men if they would, if anyone who's willing to listen, if foleyed conflict at all costs at all costs, there's no need to fight people. I was at the beach this weekend and this guy was giving me the finger is older dude, I'm sure you know, I don't think he knew who I was or had any, uh, idea that, uh, Sherry, wasn't it disgruntled lesson?

Speaker 3:          00:37:53       No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't think he had any idea. You know, that I was a nice person and that I could have, uh, talked to him through this and everything could have been fine, but there was a bunch of kids playing. It was my friend's kids. And my kids and they were playing here, this a cove area. And um, this guy had set up his, uh, his, his blanket there on a public beach, but there's people all over the place and these kids wanted to play in this cove area. And so this guy got so pissed off. We came here for a little peace and quiet and we didn't want to be, you know, people right on top of us. And I just smiled at the guy, didn't say anything, I just smiled the guy. I'm like, yeah, it was so ridiculous. There's no way I'm going even to argue with you. You're the public beach and little kids are playing to this fucking people all

Speaker 1:          00:38:35       over the place, man. Just cause people came near you. Cause you don't have this, you don't own the spot next to your spot. You don't have like a specific amount of room and the guy gives me the finger and I'm like, you're so crazy. Like you're, you're like in, you're engaging someone you didn't know nothing about. You don't know anything about me. I could be a real mean guy and I could just decide, oh, you just gave me an excuse to beat the fuck out of you and there's nothing you can do about it. I'm just going to grab you and start smacking you around and you're going to be terrified. And you gave me the green light, you gave me the finger and why don't you give me the finger bitch? There's a lot of nutty people like that out there. So I, I saw this guy do this.

Speaker 1:          00:39:10       I'm like, wow. Have you never experienced like a really crazy person before you like inviting crazy people into your life? Is that what you're doing? Yes. Like people who would do that with driving too. They play games and cut people off and hit the brakes. I dated a girl, he used to do that. She was great, great person. But she's very competitive. When it came to driving, she got ultra competitive with people and if people tried to cut her off, she would go into oncoming traffic and cut in front of them with me in the car. And I was like, listen, you gotta listen to me. You are going to get hurt. You're going to hurt me. You're going to hurt them because they got in front of your con. They made you go to your place two seconds later. This is crazy. But yeah, they did a douchey move.

Speaker 1:          00:39:52       They suck at driving. Do you don't have to speed in front of oncoming traffic and cut them off. You know you have to let them know, fuck them. You don't have to take, you know, I'm like, okay, you're, you can't, you can't be serious. Like this is a nutty way of approaching life. Like you're going to make an enemy of a crazy person. You're going to do with danger everywhere you go, you're going to do it in the wrong spot. You, you. There's a broad spectrum of people you can and can't piss off and if you piss off the wrong people, you, you're in serious fucking danger. Oh yeah. That's the thing that drives me crazy that La, I mean you're talking about this guy in the beach and stuff, people that thing that I think people in general are now I sit in la except when they're behind the wheel really wears down on my soul here because there's no other city in the country where people treat you the way they do it in La. I think we're panicking.

Speaker 1:          00:40:38       I think everybody Oughta, there's, yeah, there's so much traffic that people just panicking. They're just fucking trying to get home quicker and cut in front of people and I just take it out of my job madness. If I pull out of my drive, I yesterday at dude on Sunday I go to my wife watched this guy, he's going to try to pass me coming around the riot. I'm just coming out of the driveway and he yup, speed it up, fucking one around, made it inches, you know, death defying Ben Hur fucking bullshit. And I'm like, then we were right behind him at the light and you're like, well you're fucking 40 centimeters ahead. And they did. He got a big w out of that one. People drive cars the way they live life, but that's what I mean. It's like it reflects on everything. Yeah, you're strong. Can you open these? What are those mints? I know it's just like having an actress on this shift. Thank you brother. Would you like a then you guys, we've got one over. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       Yeah, I'm in delicious. What'd you like him then? I'm going to open it up meant to laugh at me and my inability to open this. Joe will attest that these this weekend. Exactly. Those things are tricky. Or are you good at jars it? You know what doctor fuck off my ass is what I'm good at. You know what? I'm too, yeah. The jar that I struggle with and I'm like, this is ridiculous. Like what if I was some Old Lady? I wanted to get a pickle, but I'm never opening this. I'm going to have to open this with a hammer. Like if I was an old lady and I got to one that I'm serious. Pickle jars. Like you can't open them bitches. No. Right, right. Yeah. You know, that's why they have those tools, those little rubber things you put on the top. That's like grip it better and stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:42:17       I use the a kitchen sink gloves, but even then sometimes, wow, that's a good call. Yeah, that's good. You get a good grip. Yeah, you need a grip, but it just seems like a silly thing. Like you're, you're making these so hard to open. Yeah. Like it's almost, you need tools. On the other hand, in the Zombie apocalypse, you'll be able to swan end to any charge food store and really live off that ship for awhile. The Zombie apocalypse is already happened. Have you seen this crocodile drug that these, uh, it came from? Russia crop could deal. They're calling you and stuff like that. It's um, it's a supplement for heroin for people who don't have heroin or they just want to try this when they're the sick of killing himself with heroin and it actually rots Skinaway. Wow. Like literally giant chunks of flesh, exposed bone and all these people that are taking it.

Speaker 3:          00:43:05       It's here in Los Angeles now too. Yeah, I've heard. It's insane. It's insane. It's highest clowns. I think it's deal. I've only seen it written. I haven't, I know vice has a documentary on it, but I didn't watch it. It's so depressing man. Oh my God. Last time I was here it was bath salts. That's right. But this one, when that dude eight, that dude's face. Yeah, right. Wasn't it? Around that same time, it turned out to be just weed and he just had the munchies. That's what they said it was weed. But the problem with that is of course you know that we'd stays in your system for many, many weeks. That's why fighters take like five weeks off and they still get popped now because you know the, the weed just shows up in your system. It's really hard to get wheat out of your system.

Speaker 3:          00:43:45       So like he probably wasn't really high. He probably just had gotten high. And the thing about it's testing them for bath salts is there is no test for bass off. That's the big trek. So when they say that there was nothing, the only thing that we found in his system was marijuana. They're not saying he wasn't on bath salts, they're just, they're not admitting that they don't have a test for the fucking, these crazy drugs that people just keep inventing. They don't have tests for them. So then saying, well he was high on marijuana and there's new drugs in like basically every week there's new drugs cause there's just people tinkering. It's got so tired of people trying to pretend that that was actually what happened. The guy who got high and eight, this dude's face. No, that's some silly shit. Yeah it was. But this croc deal or whatever, it is the latest, greatest and the most disturbing by far.

Speaker 3:          00:44:34       That's wild. It's really, I'll show you some pictures. You want to see some veterans? No. Okay. I'm really sensitive and a us can eat some barbecue lighter. So I was to, it won't hurt you. You're, you're old and wise enough to know. It doesn't matter. It would just be able to separate and enjoy your ribs. Just dig right in. It really does look like some walking dead shit though. Really is like, people just have giant chunks rotted away from their skin and they're still alive. Somehow. Jesus fucking quite high. It makes you want to do that too. That's so good that you're like, Shit. First it falls off and you're like, okay, I'm still getting more. Yes. A couple more. Yeah. And how long does it take before it makes your skin fall off? Does it get, does it happen right away? And that's why everybody has their skin fall off.

Speaker 3:          00:45:19       Or is it like, do you have to be a real asshole and stick with this fucking drug for six months? You know, waiting for it to rot your skin away. People are just so self destructive. And now what the fuck is that Greg? Proof? I don't know about him. I'm sitting right here and I can hear you. Yeah. What is that? Uh, I mean, like you say that thing. What did she say about La? People are panicked. I think there's too many of us. And I think when you look at rat population density studies, uh, I listened to some online talk by a police. If it was a art bell was talking to Terrence Mckenna and they were talking about a population density studies they did on rats and that at a certain point in time you get enough rats in the room, rats start doing crazy shit like that.

Speaker 3:          00:46:10       You have one or two rats in the room. Everybody's cool. You have a hundred rats in the room. Things get a little sketch. When you pay 5,000 rats, they start eating each other. They started one of, some of them will hide in the corners and just nod. They like mimic human crazy behave. Right, right. I think we're not supposed to wear, I don't think we're designed, I think we're improving, but I don't think we're necessarily designed to be around this many fucking people and it is pretty dense that, yeah, especially Los Angeles. Even in Los Angeles, a little more spread out than like say New York or something. Yes, it's definitely more spread out to New York. Look. And the thing about Los Angeles, most people that if you live in a house, you probably have like a yard, you know? And you know people that have a yard. It's something that's a nice thing to have.

Speaker 3:          00:46:51       Yeah, it is. It's a privilege. You don't get that in New York, New York City. Good fucking luck. You might get a little terrace. Yeah. If you're rich or flower box, you've got a little flower box. You just, it's concrete everywhere. Fuck that. Well, it's interesting though. There's a lot to, there's a lot of benefit to New York. It's, it's weird, but it's, you're basically on a buzz all the time because like it or not the p the people around you influenced the way you feel. The energy that you have in New York is like this move in town. There's so much going on. There's so many people. You just go, all right, here we go. And almost like Popsie up a notch. And you know, I think there's something to that. I think there's something to, to the, the, the juice that you get from being around that many people, but it's not for everybody.

Speaker 3:          00:47:41       No, it isn't. But you do you feel like something's going on and you might be missing it. Yes. Uh, I liked that too. I like San Francisco that get, well, one, I'm from there, but in the daytime you can be around people if you want. And then like, I always find that there's always unbelievable empty, quiet spaces no matter where you go in San Francisco, even in the middle of the day or night or Friday night, it's never, it's never as bustling as New York. Well, it's an unusually smart town. I mean, I think New York is kind of unusually smart a lot of ways too. There's MS obviously a lot of dumb people all over the land, but there's the, the high pockets of smart people that you can meet at the museum in New York or the high pockets of smart people that you can meet and a million different places in San Francisco. I mean, that is literally the tech tech capital of this country.

Speaker 3:          00:48:25       Yeah. The brightest minds from Google and apple and other, all in that northern California area. So if you thought about that and just, just that as a city, like that's what, that's gotta be one of the best congestion's of minds that we have little g she San Francisco, it's impossible to not be, you know, it's impossible to not be. If you been Uber successful with a bunch of different companies, a lot of really smart people. It's just, I think it's probably the smartest spot in the country. The concentration is certainly an intense, I feel it when I performed there. Oh yeah, you do because people will know what's going on. Yeah. They just seem more, they seemed really tuned in. You know, I did one of my specials, my, uh, 2006 shiny happy Jihad. They did it at Cobbs and uh, so one of my favorite ones, I just, I just always felt like San Francisco audiences have just, there's something about them, you know, they're just like one notch smarter.

Speaker 3:          00:49:21       Certainly my favorite Krug's I've always loved them just one notch. I think that La Crowds, it depends on what you play can be really amazing. You can get one notch smarter here too. And you, by the way, you get one notch smarter and Columbus, Ohio is if they come to see you, you know, if the people know you. But I just always found that collect coming up that like they almost demanded more too. I think. So. I mean I, I came from San Francisco from the old days, you know, from the 80s. And uh, there was a lot of really crazy Craig's common and if you were hacky in any way, that was kind of frowned upon and it was really important to keep pushing the conceptual law envelope and stuff like that if we were famous for never succeeding in La, you know, on stage because the ideas are too abstruse and stuff. And then of course now everyone that I know in La is from San Francisco. Well don't you think that comedy is just so evolved so much since then? You know, the, the, uh, the public's perception of comedy as well because of the Internet. I think people are just a way blue broader palate also is fueled by the club scene then and it's not as much anymore. Yeah. They do have a way broader pallet.

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       Yeah. The scene was all about the club scene. Now it's still is Kinda, yeah. I mean there's still spots like, you know, the seller in New York that just draws people to it, of the Improv and Hollywood draws people to it. The comedy store, of course, you know, there's always going to be that. But I think that the, the, the ability to promote on the Internet is the thing that changed comedy the most over the last few years. Absolutely. And it's allowed us the luxury of taking back the means of production. Yeah. Removing a lot of middlemen that we're not, uh, it turns out necessary. And it also allows Greg Proops to be Greg Proops. Like, you can do your podcast and no one gives you a hard time about anything. You make all the decisions. It's not even a compromise necessary. Like now, Greg, I was thinking today because it's president's Day, right?

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       Like, maybe you just do this thing about presidents and like, hey fuck head, you know, like what did you go make your own podcast. Okay. I everybody has ideas that they want to stick in your face and they might be good ideas but I don't want to land now. And that's the thing that's so great about this is the under, like you said, just the unbelievable self determination for freedom. And I take responsibility for it. If the show sucks, I'm like, that one wasn't as good or you know, I'll try to do it better. And I listened to him back and think, well, that could, uh, that could have, I'm a little more, it's just so effortless, you know? I mean, without being effortless, look, it always requires, like, I always feel like podcasts, the most important things that I'd just be paying attention to.

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       What the fuck's going on in the world. As long as you're paying attention to what's going on in the world is always going to be something to talk about. Oh, I live in the most bizarre time ever and we're the most like content rich comedians ever everyday. Some insane new stories that you can't fucking believe is real, but is, you know about a clam and a penis and a fucking, who knows? You know what I mean? There's like, there's always some new fucking insane story. It's like you never run out of comedy. It's impossible today. No. And that's what someone said, Jay, like as I do mind by myself and they go [inaudible] you run out of material and it's like, really not today. Nah, not anymore. I'll have to do is go on the Internet and write a paper and do this and talk to people.

Speaker 1:          00:52:36       And there's 5,000 things. Do you, um, infiltrate other communities that you don't agree with? Do you ever like go to like really conservative websites are either forums and I do, and I'll go to a lunch tray. I think you'd have to, I was just reading, speaking of infiltrating, there was an interview and I think it was New York magazine with a Antonin Scalia and they asked him the question and what did you, what do you read in the morning and shit? And he said, uh, I read the Washington Times and the Wall Street Journal, and the guy goes, you don't read the post. And he goes, I used to read the post, but I found that everything was too liberal. And then he went and the guy wants, so no New York Times at all. And he was like, no, I never read the New York Times. And I thought, okay, look, I'm a comedian. I have no responsibility to the public. I'm not holding a secured

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       position where I'm adjudicating on fucking matters of grave national importance every day of my life and writing opinions and being a deciding vote on a fucking panel of nine people who were hand chosen by psychopaths. And yet I have the capital loss city of taste to fucking watch Fox News every once in a while. And I don't go on, I got, you know, like you just go, like you can't read the New York Times because it upsets you too much and you're a justice. Like how narrow is your fucking purview? You know what I mean? Like why don't you say, I don't believe anything out, you know? And then he talks about how he believes in the devil and whatnot. And you're like, we're getting kind of weird here with the justice. Like, I mean, who is that? He believed Janine Scalia. Oh no, he didn't. Yeah, he health guilt.

Speaker 4:          00:54:14       You could go online and look up the interview when you read it. It was just, but I like to think of what's, fuck you man. I read, I w I read Fox. I'll read, cause I read news stories on my show and I'll say this is from this, you know, and obviously I read a lot from the Guardian or Truthout or whatever, you know, but I'll also go, this is from Fox News or this is from CNN or this is from a right wing, the Wall Street Journal. I read a piece from the Wall Street Journal about the fucking former head of the, uh, Shearson Lehman and shit. And I, because Richard Fault, someone said he's a survivor. And I said, he's a fucking criminal. You know, he started a new company on Wall Street and all we're supposed to feel sorry for him that he's so brave that he weathered the 2008 collapse.

Speaker 4:          00:54:51       Like you engineered it. Even people in the financial community blamed him for it was like, well, well they can a survivor that's a quote, you know, paint things and a beautiful of course. But I mean, Scalia said that. And so when you asked me do I infiltrate it? It's like, no. Do I, do I watch a steady diet of Fox News? No. Do I read right when you just to all the time, no. Do I try to read stuff from all over the world from different points of view? Yeah. Yeah. That's why Greg, cause it's interesting, you don't have to agree with everything you read. And I always say this to people about comedy. Do people that come and see you and don't like your politics and then get up in a huff and fuck off. I always think you're not sophisticated, not sophisticated. And I don't mean that in like a smart or like you went to college way.

Speaker 4:          00:55:31       I mean, uh, there are people who have no education who can understand a whole bunch of ideas at once and see the humor of, you know what I mean? Well, there's some people, there's lines you cannot cross. Their pea brains won't allow it. But that's what I mean, like come back to subject. That's off limits. Mostly. I find that if you are disagreeing, I remember last year or two years ago when the election was going, I did a joke in Eugene or Portland. Oh No. One of the places in Oregon, it wasn't in Eugene, which is wicked liberal, but it was a clown with law. I don't know where the fuck I was in Oregon. It was a city in Oregon. And uh, I said something, I said that the Republican nominees aren't just the worst group of nominees I've ever seen from the Republican Party in my lifetime there, the Reus Group of people I've ever seen in a room, you know, and started to go through them.

Speaker 4:          00:56:18       And when it was Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich and someone in the backyard, no, it was like, no, you don't get to veto jokes. And a guy, I'm not kidding. A Guy wrote me the other day on my email. Like I take email from people and I read it, I don't know his answer, but any road I was at your show in Chicago and it was podcast. So my podcast is not advertised as a standup show. It says podcast, you know, like, and therefore there's a different thing that's happening. It's a lot more real and you know, unless you know, and uh, he wrote me and he said, ah, I didn't spend this 20 bucks or whatever to hear your fucking politics. And I didn't think it was very funny. And anyone that would like to show it'd be a halfwit and shit. So normally I would just block him, you know, but I thought, I'm going to write him back and I realize you're hostile.

Speaker 4:          00:57:04       Tone is not conducive to discourse and understand this, you chose to come in the room and you pay it if you'd asked for a refund of the time, that's another matter. And I go, and by the way, after the show's over, you don't get to email the artist and ask for your money back because you disagreed with them. You take your chances, whether you go to see a symphony or a movie or a fucking whatever it is you're going to go see, man, when you go to Jack in the box, you might not like them sausages, but you don't get to fucking write me after and tell me you want your money back. And then say everyone that liked it was a moron when he was the only one who didn't like it. You know? And it's like, I don't understand that. Well, there's always going to be

Speaker 3:          00:57:42       people that can't wrap their head around the idea that there's different people and different people like different stuff. Yeah. And if you don't like something, it's okay. If there were other people enjoying it, well then you know that's for them. It's not for you. But the anger like letter like I didn't, I don't like your politics on all our fucking, that wasn't very funny. And the people are assholes. And just sending that letter, you're an asshole. [inaudible] mean you might want to tell one of your friends like that. I didn't have a good time. He's talking all this liberal shit. I, Trayvon Martins,

Speaker 4:          00:58:13       by the way, the not yet. The night I did it was uh, uh, the 50th anniversary of the march on Washington for jobs and freedom and I played a clip of Martin Luther King speech, the part I have a dream and shit. You know, cause I didn't think that crowd had heard it before because a lot of young people who haven't heard it. Exactly. And everybody listened really intently. And I thought this is what you objected to. You objected to the biggest cry for peace in the last fucking 50 years. What were the other controversial points that were discussed in the pocket? Oh, I think there was a vote rigging. Uh, I, I assert and I will stand by this, that voter fraud in this country is nonexistent in the way that the media would make you wish that it existed. Pete poor people are not pitching up in their millions to polling places and trying to fob off bad idea or whatever.

Speaker 4:          00:59:04       And then, you know, like a lot of states have Jen, this whole voter id thing and people, why shouldn't you have to show Id let me hit you to something. Um, about 10 to 15% of this country has no money at all. And those people don't have bank accounts, phones, televisions, computers or ideas. Yeah, they're ad hoc doing that shit. They don't just have it. And like for instance, I was on a show in a conservative lady said, why shouldn't people have show ids? And I said, my mother who passed away this year was 94. I said, my mother doesn't have an ID. She's voted in every election since Roosevelt's first one. Are you going to deny her the vote? What do you do? How do you go? You don't have to, if you're on the voter roll, you come up and you say your name and they've stayed on the role and I'm Greg Proops. Yeah, but they, you're not correct groups and you don't know who's doing it. Do you check that? [inaudible] Woodland Hills.

Speaker 4:          00:59:57       Greg Proops cut that part out. It's too late. It's live. Oh Shit. Fuck, I'm sorry. Uh, anyways, the and a woman said there was a plate, a case in Illinois and shit. My, my point is governments in actress, restrictive voter laws. That's what's going on with voter fraud. Making students not be allowed to vote that are in North Carolina college students not letting them use their student Id to vote. When you're living for two or three years and you are an out of state student living in North Carolina, you will now not be able to use your voter id. You see, that's a restrictive law. If you're over 18 and you're registered to vote, no matter what state you're in, ought to be able to vote in the place that you, you know, that's just one example, but I'm in like, that's all bunch of liberal Hooley is made of Liberal Hawaii.

Speaker 4:          01:00:42       I live on a bale of Hay made of Hooey for people. Need to think about less putting less money in your grill. Exactly, man. And more money in your ID collected. We're going to let the cast of winter bone vote, then I want to vote. That's all I'm saying. At a certain point in time, it wasn't everyone gonna need id though. It seems like it almost seems like they're going to jail. I agree with you. And they do and everything that everything that we possess has a code in it and it can, your wallet and everything in your wallet can be read from you know, miles away. Yeah. Yeah. And, and all that shy because of the ID chips that are in everything. And I'm like, Oh, and your phone is on all the time. We know this is just obvious shit now, but my phone is a tracking device.

Speaker 4:          01:01:21       Right, right. But I, I'm telling you that people who, who live day to day, uh, for instance, if you see homeless people, which you do in Los Angeles, they don't have a cell phone and an ID card. And you know what I mean? Like that the idea that everyone has a computer is a real white people middleclass idea around the world of the 5 billion of us. I guarantee you it's not that many. It's not the majority of people with a computer because there's lots of other countries like unless you think every single human in Africa has a computer, if you know what I'm saying. I mean like most by now, if they don't, I'd like them to subscribe to your thing. I'm selling on my podcast. It's pretty fascinating when you think about how vast the differences between the people in the poorest parts of the world and the people in the richest parts of the world, and the difference in what life is and from the jump with no, you know, you didn't do anything wrong. They just got the worst hand of cards ever wound

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       up in an incredibly poor country and no one has shoes or something terrible happened. Like you're a middle class person living in Syria or Iraq or whatever, and all of a sudden the shit hits the fan and now you have to move to a camp cause your neighborhood got blown to shit and fuck. You know, there's a lot of different, speaking of which can I plug my comedy special? Oh hell on this. Delightful, upbeat note. We were talking about people around the world possessing computers. If you do possess one, you can download my comments. If you're listening to this and you don't have something, what could you do it on a phone? Can you download it on a phone? I expect your kid. Yes. Then you can even get it on your phone. I'm just going to sit on your phone, put it on your friend's phone and then sit behind them.

Speaker 1:          01:02:58       If you're listening to this, it's impossible that you don't have access to Greg Proops comedy special. You can get it. It's a chill.com/groups or uh, Greg proops.com and a, I think it's 509 I think it's for 80 now. I think it goes up to five 99 when it comes down. I shot it lie that Musso and Frank's, you know that joint. Oh, that place in Hollywood. Oh, that what an amazing idea. I didn't even know they did shows that they down with. My manager came to me and said, I've got it loose. Hose is perfect for you. And I was like, it is perfect for me. So I say, I say a bunch of quotes from all the riders that drank there, like Bukovsky said, never get up before noon. And uh, uh, what does it, Faulkner said a time. Time is a time his dad, as long as it's being clicked off by a little wheels, only when the clock stops does time come alive.

Speaker 1:          01:03:42       And I said, Moose says is where the clock stops and time comes alive because it's always the past though. It feels like it, it looks like it. You get that Vibe, you know? And that place has been around for a long time. [inaudible] it's such a beautiful place. Yeah. I love those old Hollywood joints. Like Dan to those places are amazing cause it feels like when you go to them that you're, you're like entering into like, uh, like a time machine. You're going to a place that hasn't changed much and so many years, not even the menu of the smell bread, they give you celery and shit. You know what I'm saying? Like so good stuff. Celery food is incredible too. They have the best taken Hollywood cause they don't fuck around. No, no. It's really just steak and know what they're doing. They know exactly how to cook it.

Speaker 1:          01:04:30       Yeah. And they always get the best meat. Like they've been around forever. They have these relationships. Probably would butchers that go back to the twenties oh everybody wears jackets, man. It's insane. It's good. Yeah. Those old joints are fucking amazing. There was so much fun to do it there and we had a who sat down. It's no, I saddled it for a little bit of it. Oh yeah. Preview. Keep showing the preview. Well done. Yeah. Yeah man. Yeah. I had a little table that I could sit out and drank if I want it to. But you walked around on the floor of the restaurant? Yeah. And I had a band, CML jazz band behind man. Shit. What a great idea. It was great fun. The areas. What an original idea. Congratulations man. It looks really nice. They shot at really beautiful, beautiful idea. I love it.

Speaker 1:          01:05:12       Wow. We just had a light and a couple of cameras and uh, some smoke and we did on Sunday afternoon and everybody could drink and uh, people will a drink. That's awesome. How many shows did you do? One or two? I did one with no hax why? I did like two little things from another angle. And that was that we struck like I did an hour and then it was over. So there was no, he know there was no doing that Joko or no fixing that or know anything. Yeah. Alyssa, I believe me. I had a drink and I just fucking kept him, you know, did it? Yeah, there's a lot of like really great comics. If you watch the specials, you never got them at full bore because he got like this sort of awkward version of them. Like the perfect example is a one of Bill Hicks biggest specials.

Speaker 1:          01:06:02       He did it in London and there was a huge crowd. Oh, the one where it rides over the bridge and it's on fire. Yeah, he's got like a Voodoo child rather, uh, Jimi Hendrix. Uh, and he, uh, he's got a cowboy hat on holding. He feels stiff to me. I mean, he's staging, he feels like, you know, hey, you got one shot at doing this big special in this giant place. He rides through hoops of fire into the stage. I mean, it's pretty, it was something along those lines, right. It was something like that. It was like that. He does come over the London Bridge on a horse. I remember that. That's hilarious. No, my friend Chris Bull directed that and that was his whole concept form your, this warrior poet and you're accountable and we're going to do this and they're not, but I agree with you. It puts a lot on, I much prefer to, Oh God, it's going to ever show me myself.

Speaker 1:          01:06:50       I'm going to wear a fucking Jawa outfit. Oh yeah. Um, I much preferred being able to just stand on the floor of this restaurant. You have a drink like, and it didn't feel that pressure patch and I, it was all, you know, friends and people have friends, friends that sounds like you could drink. It was Sunday afternoon and everybody had a couple drinks. If there's so many of those little cool spots like that in Hollywood, you know the government is, the comedy store of course is one of them. The rainbow, the Rainbow God, that place is so weird. That's like going back into it and talking video or something. Man, that is, and those people still go there today? Yeah, it's their spot. Oh yeah, the rainbow. That's so funny. I forget what I was doing up there. I was going to some show business thing and I went in the rainbow too, like how the beer and used the bathroom.

Speaker 1:          01:07:37       The food's good there too. I did comedy there. These are really, is it upstairs? It's in the round where you have to just kind of walk around. There's people all around you. That's hilarious. I did one bar on Hollywood. Was the red something or another that used to be on sunset? What was it? The Rand Red Room. No, no. They just closed that place. It was a weird place. It was like you're, you are doing red, red rock. Yeah. It was like you were doing comedy in somebody's attic change. They just really felt like an attic. They just reopened it. And I guess they made that top part bigger cause it's now it's a piano bar or something weird like that. Holy Cow. That's when you know comedies failed. We lost to a piano bar. Howl at the moon when it's the two Julian [inaudible] guys. So Greg Proops stop it.

Speaker 1:          01:08:22       Hey that shit. Well that's one of the beautiful things about the attitude in Texas. Prov Addison, Texas. It's right next door to it. Yep. So dudes would come out of there, you'd be lit up and you're like, come on man, let's go play some fucking piano. Woo. And then people would be singing back and forth and dueling Pittsburgh. It's in a mall. The other bar there is the hell with the men. I think the last time I played there, I got an email. You get denied or late cause you got to do the radio the next day and like there's nothing around but that. So I went there and had a few drinks and get lit up. Oh yeah. Because after you're there for a while, you're just like, who sadder did people that are here or me because I'm here and I had to do this, you know, one man.

Speaker 1:          01:09:08       Nothing sad about it. Just get it to be wherever you are. There you be. Well, I was, I had a few drinks. So you're at Howl at the moon, taking an experience, having a little alcohol, little person dipper, some jams that I hadn't heard in a while. There you go. Little awesome old Leonard Skinner do something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Those places are despicable. They should be stopped. It's, it's kind of a weird, I don't understand. Like, well, I mean, yeah, I don't know that they're fine. It's fun, right? It's fun for people. I get it. The people want to have fun it. But as I always say on my show, I'm sure to shit on something you love, so, but you know what man? Like it's like you said, it's good to see all kinds of stuff. And I, I personally like some country western, you know, even silly stuff like Toby Keith.

Speaker 1:          01:09:51       Yeah. I like some Toby Keith songs. I think they're good. You know, I don't, I know they're silly lyrics. I don't care. I think they're good. It's doesn't bother me. I enjoy it. I enjoy a lot of shit. I can put myself in a lot of different mindsets for a Goof, you know? Did you get my, at least in city yet? Oh Dude. It's the best Jagger ever done. Bangers. Bangers, bangers. No, I heard it's doing really well though. Don't ask me how. I know her care. Britney Spears isn't it? And I'm the music, but she's in it. Yeah. She does a song with her. Wow. It's really cool. You really doubling down. Yeah. That's about a journey's greatest hits whizzes. I highly recommend that to journey's greatest hits. Do Journey has some strong songs. A lot of people don't want a minute. It's a lot of people don't want to admit it, but journey had some fucking strong songs that if you're by yourself, you'd get pretty excited if it came on the radio. No one doesn't admit it yet. That fucking just a small town scow. Yeah. Dominated the world. So much so that I was in Nashville like a year ago. And you know how there's that, what's the name of the main drag in national where all the country bars are? Whatever. And uh, uh, you know, we were drinking up and down the street after the show and we went to a country bar where it was like country open Mike. So there was the sexy dude who had the leather vest and he sang the Charlie Daniels and wanting to,

Speaker 4:          01:11:13       you just leave this long haired contract ball, right. And then every, you know, every type of open Mike country. And then there was a band that got up. Then this girl got up this blonde girl and she fucking sang journey and you're like, we're in Nashville. And the place lit up man. And I was like, Shit. She went,

Speaker 6:          01:11:29       he's Jeff for small town square out of the whole place. Like fucking

Speaker 1:          01:11:33       thought, you know, fuck yeah. Yeah. Who's crying now? That's a great song. That's a great fucking song. If you by yourself, you will, you will get very excited when that song comes on. If you run a bunch of checks that you, you know, if they know you, you're going to let them know the enjoy a little journey. Yeah. That's when my new guilty pleasure events people judge you on. Yeah. Oh yeah, they do judge you like my friend Joey, Joey Diaz, he gets really mad at Eddie Bravo for Eddie Bravo loving kiss. And I've told them a mug. I'm sorry dude. I love some case. Yeah, you're fucking 45 years old, Joe Robbing Mother fucking listening to that Shit. Fuck you. Listen to that shit. You're telling me it's one of the greatest albums of all time. Suck my Dick. And he'll just, he just goes off. You can't enjoy, you cannot end. Never. No one ever said it was the greatest album of all time. No, no, no. You can't enjoy it. You can. I want to rock and roll all night is magnum magnum opus. Yeah. Yeah. That's a fucking great. So Detroit rock city is a fucking great sunshine.

Speaker 4:          01:12:34       I saw them a long time ago and uh, in the 70s and the night hours died and uh, that was pretty weird. How old were you? 16. 17 I think. Um, that he died on my sister's birthday. And uh, Elvis did. Yeah, everybody died that year, wasn't it? 77. Because I think being an Chaplin died that year too. Big Year real business. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. But I went to see kiss, I've told this story before, but the, at the end, Dave and screaming all night and they spit blood and they spit fire and they're on platforms like grain elevators and shit. And you know, they did all their numbers and they did Detroit Bucks and I sold a joint to a 10 year old and yeah, fuck you man. And gangster back. Oh Dude. I that's why, that's how I roll. And uh, we drove up from San Carlos to the cow palace in, uh, I remember at the end of the show, gene Simmons goes

Speaker 1:          01:13:36       badly and then they did gel. That might be the worst. She's him and compression the world has ever known. I can't do him. Maybe it was Paul to someone's house, a divorce. Well those screens, everything they would say, maybe it was Paul then, cause Paul does. That's probably Paul. And anyways, they played jailhouse rock but like kids, so it was like, oh, Whoa, oh, you

Speaker 4:          01:13:59       know. Right. You know, like they didn't like pep up the beat. And I remember turning to my friend in the depths of my drunkenness and weed drank like a jug. And those days you used to bring plastic jugs full of odd kit. Right. It could a plastic jug in and if it had lemonade, you know, we didn't have sports bottles, we had plastic jugs. Remember? Yeah. I remember those. And um, so like, uh, yeah, even in the depths of my degradation at that point, having sold weed to a child and was pretty drunk, I, uh, turned him in. And why are they playing chess rock? Yeah. And then the next morning, of course Elvis dies at 44 or whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:14:36       It would have been pretty bad ass if they did it like in a totally different musical styles.

Speaker 4:          01:14:40       Right. Then their own, yeah. Yeah. If they did it like, well, two Pi, they really did it. I liked the ability to shut up. Wow. No, no. They did kiss. It was like God offender. If, if that works with Joe House wrong,

Speaker 3:          01:14:56       don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, that's another good song. Yeah. Fuck you Joey Diaz. How dare you. They're not the best crowd. Listen man, I don't think there is the best group, but I think there's sometimes where kisses the best group cause that's what you want to hear at that moment. That might be chill sometimes I just like, I'm looking through my iPod and I'm like, Yay, let's listen to a little of this. And then there's sometimes it's the stones and then sometimes it's something else.

Speaker 4:          01:15:23       We'll play a little group called Whitesnake doing here I go again.

Speaker 3:          01:15:27       I've told the story many times but I'll tell it again. I was in a car accident. This was when I was 21. I had this girlfriend is 25, but she's telling me what to do. She was so hot though. Um, but we, we got in a car accident and um, I was pulling out the stuff from my car cause he had it towed my car away. Some dude ran the light and smashed into me and she made me throw out my Whitesnake. She was like, why do you still have this throw this way? And I was like, what?

Speaker 6:          01:15:55       Hey Rocco.

Speaker 4:          01:16:10       And then tiny kitchen put your thing in your face.

Speaker 3:          01:16:12       She was my drug dealer though. Really? Well she had pussy. Yeah, that was my drug dealer. Yeah. She was my drug dealer when I was 21 plus. He was the gray, the greatest drug of all time. I did. It took me a while to understand like why we want bound up in these relationships where people would just like be completely unreasonable and we wouldn't get along at all. And I realized, Oh, I'm like a druggy druggy for putting, there's something at the end of this. This is like, this is not like a relationship where you, this is the type of person or the person that you want to be with. This is the person you can tolerate because you guys like to fuck each other. Yeah. It's not healthy. It's not a good way to go about it.

Speaker 4:          01:16:48       Well, it's short term, not the long game. The long game

Speaker 3:          01:16:55       to avoid argument at all costs. Greg proof.

Speaker 4:          01:16:58       Nah Man. And it's something that you never learned. That's horrible. Stay off the Moore's. Yep. Stick to the road now she kept it dealt with. It's a, the point is why I have to feel like I'm right. You don't. If you didn't then real all relationships would be smooth sailing

Speaker 3:          01:17:15       sometimes. Sometimes people just have fucking hormonal swings. Sometimes people just have weird career paths and their life, like it's weird dating someone who's going through a real rough spot in a career. Like I never realized how women get so much more emotional about like work kind of stuff. Then my guy friends did like when I was dating, I was dating this girl and she was having a hard time whether a her job and you know she, her career was kind of in shambles and she, the way she was looking at it was so emotional. It cry and this isn't working and what am I going to do? Whereas if it was one of my guy friends, they'd be like, dude, I'm getting fucking fire. Right? Like this sucks. I think I'm a, I'm thinking about doing this. I might be doing that. And my uncle knows this.

Speaker 3:          01:18:00       I told him, I told my brother and he told me, you know, there's, there's a plan, there's some shit in motion, there's get going. Whereas like for some women, the struggle of like dealing with like personal failures are dealing with um, work type failures, tapper, super impactful. And I think that's a weird thing for guys to wrap their heads around it. And, and, and I'm not discounting the fact that a lot of guys have a lot of like big time emotional connections with things that go wrong at work too. But I've never seen it from my guy friends. Like I had seen it from girls that I dated.

Speaker 4:          01:18:36       Well, if you want to come to my house, I'll cry in front of

Speaker 3:          01:18:38       my career.

Speaker 4:          01:18:40       I try to limit it to the car, you know, it's your podcast doing well. Yeah. Thank you. It's a great podcast. Thank you very much. Really Fun and very unique

Speaker 3:          01:18:50       to explain to people how you do it because you do it differently than pretty much anyone.

Speaker 4:          01:18:54       Well, I don't use humor in mind per se. Uh, I invite people to waste up to two hours of their life listening to me talk and drone on and on about should I have no business. I sit in front of a live crowd and uh, and just spiel basically for the first like half hour, 45 minutes. And then I kind of get to the second part, which is the boring preachy part and that's when it's about the news and the government and whatever. And I often have the Bible of the Constitution Handy and I'll read little parts of it out just to make sure people are down with the letter of the law. And um,

Speaker 3:          01:19:26       how do people react to that? Do you find the, you're getting mostly people who know what you're doing and know what to expect or do you get a lot of people that are kind of surprised because they thought it was like a comedy podcast or they thought you were just going to do stand up? Well, that's so interesting that other guy that was saying that's silly,

Speaker 4:          01:19:41       right? Like, I think at the beginning, um, the people that didn't like it listened to it once and that was it for them. You know what I mean? Like, Eh, you know, the first couple of months I did it, I think all the people who thought I was the cute funny one from who's line, like he's going to be that way and then, oh wait, he's poisoned about this and he thinks about this and he cares about that and I don't want to dot. I think they just appeared early. And what I've found is sometimes I think as an interminable leak, you know, just a Sufi desert, devoid of humor. Just my opinion for ever and ever is the part that people really liked because I think people want you to beat yourself, like you said. And that's really the closest to being myself as a comedian, that I've ever been even more than stand up, which I always thought was the most direct way I think the podcast is, you know, cause it's from the heart and I don't think about what, I mean I put some stuff together, but I don't write anything, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:20:34       And then whatever stories I tell, it's like on the night, I think it's something that something spurred onto me or usually it's about where I am or what time I was there before or something that happened that day. Or, you know, like you said, there's always something to talk about. And so that's how I kind of do it. And then I take questions at the end, uh, on the road. I always take questions at the end and we just hash it around. And some, there's been a couple of that. The, the public, uh, the public that the people who listened to it sort of came up with, like, I never started it, but someone said, well, who's your all time baseball team of Roman emperors be? Or whatever. So I made one up, right. And then the next time someone goes, well, who would the king and Queens of England Bay, who had your chief justices be?

Speaker 4:          01:21:11       He would the president's be who had the greatest women in history. So I have all these different teams that we've done over the years and I just make them up in the moment. I don't, you know, sometimes I fuck him up cause you know, I'm high and I'm trying to think of a whole bunch of shit at once. And I mean I remember in London my, they said kings and Queens of England and I went through it and my English friends up came up to me. We went, wow, I thought you're going to, I was worried about you there. And I'm like, fuck you. I know. No, I know enough kings and Queens of England to make a baseball team out of them. You know, you're supposedly, it's supposed to be funny, you know, like the Roman emperor when I remember it because I said a calendula behind the plate because he can handle balls and you know, but there's more salient ones than that.

Speaker 4:          01:21:53       Can you do? But I didn't make that up. And then I talk about Negro Leagues and Satchel Paige a lot and that became the thing on the show. Like people who hate baseball, hate sports and don't even know what the Negro Leagues are. Write me now and go, it's interesting when you talk about it, because I liked the talk. You know, you know when you're passionate about, you know when you like something and you imbue that with enthusiasm, not like hashing through that same bit that you've done 4,000 times in the clubs and you're just like, oh fuck, here's the closer, you know, there's none of that feeling to that. What we're going to ask me, I'm sorry, I don't know nothing. I just wondered if you could do Bob the builder in an erotic situation. No, I wouldn't do that, but a, I loved Bob too much, but I would say that Wendy was exactly like Bob, but with earrings, let me just put it that way.

Speaker 4:          01:22:34       I think that we're lesbians. That's weird that you did that. I never, never knew you did that. That's a huge franchise. Do you get it? Was Bob the builder cartoon for a Stop Action Animation for children under four? Basically, it's, I think two to two and three year olds. Really? Yeah, my nieces and nephews and he, he lives in, uh, England and, uh, the production, I haven't done it for a few years, but he used to do it. And, uh, I was the American voice, the North American voice, Canada and America. And, uh, it, it's, uh, it's supposed to teach you to reuse and recycle and shit like that. Oh, there he is. He wears a little belt and whatnot. And uh, look at you because you're so adorable. Bob. The builder. Can we build it Bob the builder? Yes, we can. And then like, he would go, uh, English when he lived in a caravan and drank tea, but in the American when he lives in a trailer and drinks coffee.

Speaker 4:          01:23:30       So, wow. We had to translate it into American and it would be like, you know, they were going to build a road somewhere and there was a bird's nest. So what do we do about the bird? You know they're little, little short vignettes and there was a couple of feature films too that were kind of funny like Westerns and stuff and, and all those characters have names. They're all called like scape and muck and whatnot and Mackay and never been adequately scrambler you ever been at a place like ordering something and a kid go mr you Bob the builder and they always pant like that right before they say it to you, they're going to say, I can't believe I heard your voice. I know, but parents too, parents will be watching this. Parents will be watching Bob the boat with their kids and all of a sudden they tweet really, really cause on my, on my show it's smoke dope and drink and you know, take drugs and do that.

Speaker 4:          01:24:21       And then they like, but then I don't think it's that big of a dichotomy. I mean it's for little kids, why shouldn't I be a role model for two year olds is swollen like speedy, skip that one, let's call it once again, it's, you know, little kids, little kids cause someone's going to pull, those are toxins. Shit like, you know, like cute. I loved it because we would fly to London and recorded in Soho and we would order out. And I always, Scott Curry or Chinese food, I mean like I love the Gig. It was such, there's a bar Italia on Dean street out. Go there and have an espresso before and then I'd go over and record. And it was like, it was fun. It was just fun. And the voices, this voice show the storable apart and went into the audition. If I've told this before, I'm sorry, I went to the audition in London and I was reading and I did all these funny voices, you know, Oh, this and that whatnot.

Speaker 4:          01:25:15       And a English person comes on over the, you know, inner common cause, uh, Greg, could you, uh, would it be all right if you're just a jewel voice? And I said, are you insinuating I have a car 10 place? And uh, she went, well, what did you try it one time? So I went like, Oh, good for you, Andy recycled. And then they were like, perfect. Loved it. They gave me the job right there. Wow. That's never happened to me before. Since with any job and do it in your own voice the way I'm speaking to you. It would Joe Rogan. Well, you're a famous, you live out here in this place. It's so nice here in Sunflower Valley. You're famous enough comedian that I'm sure they know exactly what you talked like when they brought you in. I think that was it. I said, listen, let's be perfect, Greg. Being Greg proven, I

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       spent 10 minutes doing other ways at them going like, oh, this isn't working out until one of them

Speaker 4:          01:26:09       came on and said they go, would you like to do it in the studio? And I went, ah yeah, I would. That'd be really fun. So I ran out right

Speaker 1:          01:26:18       siding called my voice agent in London and wet like fucking call them back right now. You know what I mean though, right. Let them think about it. Don't let them get a Canadian. And I would love to do voices. That was a fun one. That lasted about three or four years till they sold. And this is what happens in show business. This is a lot of Canadians on here out there. It was hell yeah. Oh yeah. Oh happy Canadian thanksgiving by the way. Thank you. Oh, powerful Canadian thanksgiving. It is a very powerful and uh, interchangeable Columbus Day of it. Only because sometimes this is the 12 sometimes it's Jane. Oh, so today is or isn't. It is, it is, but you know how this one's fluid, like President Day, you know kids don't get that off school anymore. No, no. Funny when we were talking about it today, like yeah, cause they realize Columbus was kind of a mass murderer.

Speaker 1:          01:26:59       Right? No holidays changed more in ethos from the time we were a little to now. Well, like Santa Claus didn't become a fucking housebreaking know sexual violator. Yeah, you're right. Like first it was Columbus discovered America with those Santa Maria and the Pinto Nina. And then it was, oh, he never really got to America. He was in The Bahamas or some shit. And then it got to, he's a murderer and just dashing babies' heads on rocks and you hear the stories of the year and they would force people to get, bring them back gold. And they would have to bring whatever they weighed and gold every week. And if they didn't, they'd cut one of their arms off. Oh yeah. So they do it to a couple people. They cut their arm off and everyone's screaming. And so the rest of them just scramble and go and get that gold. Like they, they there. Do you remember the last time I was on, we talked about Columbus, cause you called them the new original gangster. He really was. Well I think everybody was gangster back then. You know, the crown couldn't, yeah. Wait,

Speaker 4:          01:27:55       it was when he got back after the first one, it took a long time. The other guy who hated him, it was also co captain or the expedition died for much to his good fortune. He was in another boat. He was in the Nina and uh, oh, so Columbus got back after much ado. Yeah. You've got your Portugal almost crashed, landed the whole fucking enchilada. When he finally got to Ferdinand and Isabella, he had enough stuff with them from that first journey. And by the way, he left like 40 guys there. Cause th the Santa Maria ran a ground and it was fucking scuppered. So he just left a bunch of fucking guys in the Caribbean and they died. They got in fights with the Indians and died when he got back to Spain and finally, finally got to a friend in front of the king and Queen.

Speaker 4:          01:28:34       He had a co, you know, eight, 10 Indians and some parrot and some goals and some native shit. And they went, you know, their minds are blown. No one knew there was another world right now. I mean people knew there was another world, but they didn't know that you could go find a new one like that. Like he came back with people from another place who spoke Arawak and had fucking monkeys. What the fuck is this? Here's a bunch of men, 10 times more money, a bunch more boats. The second expedition was hugely funded and he went up with horses, cannons, the whole fucking Enchilada. Wow. The first one was like when you send your friend to fucking Home Depot, you, here's my car, don't use the blinker. You know, he barely made it there and back on the first one. And yes he did do all those horrible things to the Indians.

Speaker 4:          01:29:21       He was had no notion of them as people. He was a strict Catholic. He believed that he'd been singled out by God. That too, just the idea of custody, those arms off cause they didn't bring enough gold and doing it in front of their family knew that if he didn't produce precious goods for the Spanish crown, that he wasn't going to keep getting funded. When he went back and that was the driving to keep going and pushing through to Asia was what he was after to find China cause he knew there'd be ivory and pearls and all that shite total. But look what he look at it on the other hand, within 20 or 30 years at Columbus, now they're in Mexico. And within another hundred years of that, the largest silver mine in the world, that giant mountain of silver, that all of the silver of Asia for 400 years came from because of the Spanish trade routes between China and shit.

Speaker 4:          01:30:11       They reduced a mountain of silver in Mexico and some in South America too. And you use the Indians to fucking do it on the mountain of silver. I mean, there's a book called 1493, uh, Charles Mann. Well, well, using Columbus is the line of demarcation for everything. There's a book called 1491 and a book called 1492. And the vehicle, because he's the first contact, you know, between west and east or between, between the Americas and you and the old world. And, uh, on his boat he had, he was Italian. He had Portuguese. If there was some Spanish there, some genuine, it's probably a couple of donations. Uh, by the time Cortez, when Cortez came over, which is what, 30 years after, there was women conquistadores on his boat, women concaves dead. There was about two or three conquistador has in his book why they don't tell you all the fun stuff, kind of game of Thrones.

Speaker 4:          01:31:04       Exactly. Big giant warrior. Imagine what a bad acid or you had to beat a beyond that fucking mission and Cortez burn the boats and took a vote with everybody and said, you want to go back or not? And they were like, he goes, okay, this is how it's gonna go. We know where the capital of the [inaudible], this is our mission and let's look. And they got all the Indians along the way and that's how they did it. And they burned the boats. They couldn't go back. Yeah. But according to one book I read by Bernal Diaz, who was the last survivor of that mission, he landed up in like Honduras or whatever, the little ranch when he was old. He writes the forward, I'm old and I'm blind now, but I'm going to tell you what the fuck happened when on the mission with Cortez and he'd been on a previous one with another conquistador and then he says he didn't just say we're burning the boats.

Speaker 4:          01:31:47       We took a vote. Whoa. Captain General Cortez said to the boys, parrot is you can go back to Cuba where they were living or you can go back to Spain where you got nothing horsch gold and fucking glory in to notate lawn and you may die and they may eat. You eat your heart out. Such an ability to take risks back then. It's pretty extraordinary. I mean the genocide and the Indians is of course the disgusting part. But I mean the Aztecs did have a organized army and you know, it wasn't, it wasn't a hundred Spanish guys. They had tens of thousands of Indians in their army. When they finally laid the big battle out, Columbus on the other hand just Kinda maraud around the Caribbean and tried to get these poor fucking Indians who had no gold to give him gold. And he was in the wrong country, man.

Speaker 4:          01:32:36       You know America's where gold as well. Didn't they give him something at some point in time they gave him a little baubles but those bottles would come from the mainland or child across the Caribbean or from South America where there was stuff and that they didn't have any gold there. So they were weighing little earrings and nose rings and Shit. And He'd be like, that was it though. Total focus and they couldn't understand it cause they're giving him chicks and food and like, what else do you want? We don't have, we don't have fucking the gold. And why is the Goldson wouldn't you? It's not important to us. They were like, and he just went as soon as he saw any gold. That was the end of that. We have, how do they have this? Obviously they have that one account from Cortez you were talking about from one of the people that, oh there's loads of accounts of Cortez cause there's friars that row.

Speaker 4:          01:33:22       How do they have these accounts? Oh, Columbus wrote a diary and a guy's on the ship wrote diaries and a, there's a famous a priest who was the sort of the conscience of the new world who decried the genocide against the Indians from the very beginning. And the Spanish kept meticulous records and there's a giant library in Seville called the library of the indies where all of the Caucasians are doors. Fucking documents are collated and captain. So there's, that's awesome. Are Legal Society. So you brought a priest with you, you bought a notary with you, you brought lawyers with you, you brought generals with you, you brought a doctor, you wrote shit down. You fucking, when you took over a town, you wrote a sign and posted a crucifix sense. So how much did you agree to the Indians who can't understand you that you are taking over their town and the name of the King of Spain and Chin?

Speaker 4:          01:34:07       How much bullshit, all of that. I mean, you know, so when the, when they would tell their version of the events, how much of it was bullshit histories all spinning, isn't it? I don't think all of it's bullshit because there's a lot of real, also Indians wrote accounts later who learns within a generation. Obviously there's Mexicans, which are the marriage of Indians and Spanish. Right. And uh, within a generation, all of the Aztec Nobles of which there were lots and all the nobles in Mexico from the Indian tribes married into rich, you know, married into Spanish family. So they were raised as rich people who spoke Spanish now and they were able to tell their stories as well. There's a lot of first person accounts by the explorers. Cabeza de Vaca kept a diary and I mean is, is great because it's so self serving, you know, o nit whole portions of the journey and he doesn't mention some of the ratty shitty did and the radish shit was all ratted out by priests.

Speaker 4:          01:35:06       Right? Yeah. And then later expeditions within by the second expedition, guys were mutinying on and, and, and fucking going back to Spain and ratting on and then vet. He was a terrible and competent fucking commander and that he had, once they got on land, he was useless and he didn't know how to handle it. The Indians and there was always in her violence with the cruise killing each other and choosing sides and hiding on different parts of the island from each other and not doing what he asked him to do. He was a terrible commander on the sea. The greatest thing you can say about Columbus's, he's an extraordinary navigator. He knew that there was going to be a trade wind and he caught it. Having had some of that knowledge, he knew that if he went down and got it, he could come and get one back and I think he guessed that he surmised that or he knew from other sailors and shit that you wouldn't actually get lost in die.

Speaker 4:          01:35:54       You could come back to Europe from wherever you were going in Asia and he didn't have a a telescope. This is previous to the telescope, so he is dead reckoning and evidently was terrible with instruments. Like he had an astro lab and he had a sextant but he couldn't fucking use them very well. So all of his reckonings in the book, Andy kept two separate notebooks. One with his navigational charts and another with fake ones in case anybody caught him cause he didn't want anybody copying is root cause he thought he was going to have the monopoly on going to the new world. And so within of course, 20 years, within, within four years, there's a whole bunch of other Spanish vessels coming over and you know, within 10 years it's all over. There's growing lever. So when he first starts writing it down, you said he's writing, he's not using instruments.

Speaker 4:          01:36:45       He, he could, he had instruments what? They're crappy, they didn't have any idea of longitude. Right. Latitude was kind of a free flowing affair. If you had shit you could focus on like stars or bodies of, you know, islands or whatever that you could navigate, which is why those mounts of the world always seems so small from them. Um, so he had to reckon by currents and winds and the color of the water, how the water, the salinity of the water tasted. They had a rope with thumbs on it, marked in knots and that take soundings to see how fucking deep the sea was. And all of a sudden when they got near and the crew was having a heart attack, cause they'd been out for a couple months and it's true. The crew was like, hey, we're going to die. And he said, calm the fuck down.

Speaker 4:          01:37:36       And the next day, uh, clearly something a human had made, like a carved paddle hit the boat and they pulled it out than what, you know, there's something over there. And then the next day a bunch of branches and shit. And then birds. And when there's birds and branches, there's fucking islands. And they knew then the men started to get hip to the fact that he wasn't wrong, that there was something over there. And then of course see he said whoever sees the island first gets a prize and the guy in the middle of the night saw the lights and he said when they got up in the day, I saw him last night

Speaker 3:          01:38:14       do shouted his crew never loved him. What lights did he see? Fires to? Indians were burning. Oh Wow. Fascinating.

Speaker 4:          01:38:23       I know, right. That's amazing. It's really weird to think of their gear navies. No rifles on the first expedition. Maybe a couple, not rifles like Arca buses that you lit a fuse and put it in a breach and you know you gotta pack it down, pack it down with the ball, low crossbows, a few costs. Suppose that was considered real high tech to have those with you. That was a big deal to have like an organized group of Cross Bowman because an organized group across group Bowman could wipe out lots of people out. Whatever's accurate. Yeah, the armor thing never worked out for them with all the conquistadores. Within a few weeks they'd all fucking started wearing the Indians armor because it was too hot, too much stuff. They were metal and metal rots in the jungle and shit and this, so the Indians had fabulous cotton textiles that made, made, you know, so Columbus is

Speaker 3:          01:39:13       his journals. They were all his own way of measuring the salinity, his own way of measuring the color of the water. So he would just describe that like that's how he knew

Speaker 4:          01:39:24       she had been at sea since he was a teenager. Genewiz tended to go to ca cause they were slave traders and there was always a tradition of slavery in Genoa, which is why he didn't perceive the Indians is people as much as his first thing he wrote back was like, I think we found a bunch of slaves here, you know? Wow, we can use these people to build stuff. And then of course their temperament was not that way and he didn't manage any of the situations. Right. And he betrayed everybody and that's why it all went so horribly shitting. All those Indians are dead. There's no Caribbean Indians.

Speaker 3:          01:39:57       It's just weird when you stop and think about what a short amount of time ago that was. Oh my God. So short days, it was 500 years. Seems like a long time for one person. But once you've been alive for a little while and like you're in your forties and you start looking and going, you know that didn't take that long. It seemed like he moved pretty quick. How many of these are left? How many of them do you get in the life? My mother was 94 when she passed away. That five of those born in 1919 yeah. Five lives. Birth to death. And you're dealing with like the most horrible atrocities that you know we have like on record,

Speaker 4:          01:40:30       there was no chat lines when my mother was born. There was no, it's so weird. Ads are growing up in Columbus, Ohio because that's named after Christopher Columbus. And there's all these fucking statues everywhere. Like just like celebrating this man and you grew up in school celebrating the sky and it's just weird now like reading what we looked at the men and not at any other reality. Keep talking. Should we? Oh, okay. We can adjourn if you like. I know. Right? And if you go to Seville, there's a giant statue of him. Uh, and there's one in Barcelona to, you're looking out over the scene. And then the statue in Seville is in the cathedral and he's being carried in a litter, you know, by four Indians from different tribes and they're wearing their Indian garb. And he's in a big brass. But I are like that.

Speaker 4:          01:41:20       And his foot is rubbed completely shiny cause it's good luck to rub. Columbus's put in, Seville was on a river and every year when the fleet would come back to treasure fleet from the new world, they'd be ladened down like almost to the water line with fucking gold and precious goods and people and stuff. And they'd come up the river and there was a chain across the river and Sybil and they'd pull the chain out and, and it sail up the river. And that was a big event every year because when the treasure fleet came back, it was like, and of course Spanish people got none of that money. It's just the crown. And then what did they do? Wage war against the French in the hall, the Dutch and the English for fucking 300 years and blew all the money. Did you see that,

Speaker 1:          01:42:03       uh, document that documentary about Sunset Boulevard? No. You should really see, are we still trying to get the director? We're working on that. The history of sunset. It's real interesting. Oh yeah. How old are they used to have one like street, like dirt road going down the street. And that's really, that's a really cool movie. I recommend. I'd like to I think make a map. Well I know I saw another one that was about like, you know that its heyday in the 60s and all that jazz when it was go go joints and Zeros. You watched a documentary on Ciro's? Well it included sue us and then it had the riots and you know Jim Morrison and whiskey in the hall, you know like a groovy that's right. Their whiskies on sunset. Yeah. What a fucking street facing rain that to be across the street from the store before the House of Blues used to be a hotel, I believe.

Speaker 1:          01:42:52       Yeah. I just drove by it today. But then there's that high at that's next stored to the comedy store or that's two doors down. And if you remember the newly sergeant pepper's lonely hearts club band, let Peter Frampton they stay in that hotel cause they come out of that inosine. Really? Yeah. The one with the Skybar no, no. The one on the other side of the street on the comedy store style though. Right back a tiny. What does that, what's the hotel kind of that standard is a standard, uh, our, is that what it is? Something like something like that. It's for some fancy Schmancy, very nice hotel. But the um, that's on, that's that area like out has an insane look. That view. That's what that is. Yeah. Well there's, there's so many spots like that on that, those hotels there, they all have little pools and scenes at the pool and all that jazz.

Speaker 1:          01:43:44       You weren't in a, where are you in San Francisco when that guy jumped off the roof? That was before your time, right? Wait, before you talked to the Hyatt, the who was protesting during the Jay Leno days. Oh golly. The, the comedy store. And the Improv, I guess comics were like picketing. They were on like, oh Golly, day back. What was that? That was like, wait, that wasn't a seven Letterman when let him, it was a standout. Oh, was it really that far? Yeah, that's right. Well, they, um, they, uh, you know, that's like kind of a famous spot, right? Just trying to get any money for science. Yeah. It's a weird thing that they're working for free and Hollywood and we still do, I still do shows for free all the time. Yeah. Well I think it's important to work out a lot. So, you know, doing those free shows, it's good.

Speaker 1:          01:44:32       Let's you fuck around guilt free, try out new shit. And like, sometimes I'll go up and I'll intentionally put myself in like a little bit of a hole by just starting out with an idea that's kind of half ass, like panic my way into figuring the way through the bit. You know, I wouldn't do that in a regular show, but uh, one of those. Yeah. Yeah. One of those just show up shows. Those are, um, they're interesting. They're good but good to fuck around. Free range chicken. Yeah. That's the other good thing about La man. There's an amazing community comedians out here, but think about that. Just the sheer volume of clubs and comedians and the breadth, like every type of Canadian, oh, he got to these other towns and you know, you go everywhere and I'll work in a place in God's will be like, oh, I don't know if I were to move to Atlanta.

Speaker 1:          01:45:15       I'm like, he advised that if he got to a place on a Tuesday night, you're following fucking patent and Sarah Silverman and shit. Like he didn't just walk into it. You know I got your game. Your game has to get you came together. If I want him to shut someone down, I would love to have a Greg Proops announcement like that would be an incredible service that you could provide. Be advised, like the way you would phrase things, if you continue this down, the road of altercation with my client results will be catastrophic. I think you'll find the uncertain times.

Speaker 1:          01:45:55       I advise. Great caution in that regard. Now you can't just a swan up here and I mean, I think the only important thing in La is like, I remember reading it in a magazine years ago, a guy like said the three important things about being in La. He's like, no, why you're here. What's the number one wine? He goes, if you're here to sleep with people, then that's what you're here for. Yeah, I'm fucking bullshit me and tell me a riding it thing. Right? If you're writing, write that thing. There is a lot of that, right? Well that's the, he said the reason why you're here, do you, the reason why you're here. And then the second one was returned your fucking calls, which I thought was, those are two good pieces. I mean if people go to lunch, go to la, but a little bit like a teach come to be an actor, teach, come to be a comic.

Speaker 1:          01:46:40       Did you come to write it then? You know, not that you can't do them all at once, but if you're going to say you're a comic, you got to go out and work every night and be, do comedy, you have to be seen and doing in my opinion. You say you want to be a comment until you make a living doing comedy and then you say I'm a comic. Yeah cause there's a lot of comics out there and I get it. You're still a comedian. I guess you are still a complex sort of. There's a lot of guys who actually never graduated from open mic. I don't want to mention any names but they're really funny guys. They just, I guess those are the, that gets my argument. My argument just fell apart because they got yourself stuck comics. Yeah. Well the whole goal was to make a living on it.

Speaker 1:          01:47:16       When you first start to make money at it, you can't believe that you're getting any money. And then when you start to make a living at it, which chicken takes a long time. I think it took care of not just starting now. That's what's weird to me cause I took advantage of the web. You know, as a comedy, you know, we're selling our special on the web. We do our fucking shows on the web. This wasn't available to us, man. And the promotion and the ability, the ability to be you on your podcast. Like we were talking about that before we even started, like no one would really let you do that. No, no one. I would just say great proves just here's the, you know, two hours. This kit it right, right here. We won't say anything. We'll fucking, everything you do, love it or hate it will be positive and you fucking high five.

Speaker 1:          01:47:59       You know, now that someone's always going to have enough. I know that was never going to happen in the old ship is, and so I kind of like this, uh, what you should do guys do sort of like an odd couple shows since you've been emailing back and forth with that dude, get that dude on the podcast with you and he gets to sit next to you and go, yeah, well here's a bunch of fucking bunch of bullshit. It's a bunch of liberal bullshit. I didn't call me to hear liberal bullshit. All right. Right. And just keep me honest the whole time. The king, what the fuck is this bullshit? It's a good idea. It could be like sort of, you know, like some sort of a top art type thing. He likes red meat. It'd be a good battle, Greg. It's keen law, each other. Men's Dicks. Do you, um, uh, read, uh, any, uh, you have like a regular reader of history books? Is that how you know so much about Columbus or you just fascinated by that?

Speaker 4:          01:48:49       Well, I read a bunch of Columbus books. There's one called the four of wages by Larry Bird drawn. Then there's Columbus's own version. I was playing in Bloomington, Indiana at that nice a comedy club there. And uh, I haven't been, there was a bookstore in Bloomington. Bloomington's God the attic. Okay. And uh, in the bookstore I found Columbus as the four voyages and I'd already read this other guy's book and this was Columbus as account and if, and his son Bartella Mayo and then someone else too. So I thought, well, I'll read it as account and see what the fuck him, you know, to get another source. And then right now I'm reading a book about Da Vinci painting the last supper and stuff like that. It was pretty, you know, these people don't seem like people, you know, like you say you are disconnected from the reality of, but then when you think like, uh, it's set in this book, like Davinci would write like notes like uh, got a German kid work and for me, you know, like it is notebook.

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       How'd you go to the store? I needed to buy socks or whatever. You're like, it makes it more, and the Davinci didn't spend all this time making masterpieces. He designed sets and costumes for loads. You know, they're always having events in pageants. He was in a royal court, so he did a lot of that. He invented like stage such that opened up and there'd be freaky shit inside everybody. Oh my God. Like he did special thugs. He was unbelievably brilliant and sketched all the time, period. A book with them all the time. So you don't always have the notebook. That's why there's so much of his stuff left. Cause he wrote so many notebooks. Yeah. And when you start thinking about the people that have though of that day, the Leonardo Davinci's, the Michelangelo's, the great, great artists of the past. It's hard to wrap your head around what their life must've been life.

Speaker 1:          01:50:31       No medicine, you know, they have nothing. Barely nothing. No. The band. And he had some saws. If your fucking leg studio is pretty big though, it wasn't really. Yeah. The one he had an uh, Milan was pretty big because his patron gave him like a used calsl they weren't using anymore. So he had a nice big space and a few guys working for him. And I share a little Italian kid that stole all the time and would buy candy with the money stolen shit. Oh yeah. I like, it becomes a little more human, you know, and that he's just gay basically. He's just gay kid one really says anything like Leonardo as queer and apparently really good looking and amazingly strong could bend a horseshoe. This is the last thing you want a gay guy who could bend a horse shoe. Just devastatingly handsome, strongest, a better artist in you, funnier than you.

Speaker 1:          01:51:16       Better musician than he played the lion's gay. That's the balance. Gay and the dental. He, he was real witty guy who lived hundreds of years ago. Well talk, he's so famous still because he was the life of the goddamn renaissance, you know. Oh I'm sure. Well I mean you talk about bad motherfuckers who've named have carried through the ages. Leonardo, Stephanie Nardo, Davinci. I mean he did so many amazing illustrations. Some the human body and its ideas of, you know, his ideas of how to sculpt things and how to draw things and how to space things was so advanced and brilliant. It is ridable like placement of the images and his work. There's so there's like, you know, when they do studies of, of works of art, like what is appealing about certain pieces of art? It's so difficult to like count the tangibles. Like what is it as a sense of symmetry?

Speaker 1:          01:52:07       Is it the depth of perception of, of distance and space? What is it about this piece? It's so remarkable, remarkable and striking. And because it's not necessarily always the subject matters, how the subject matter's displayed and there's so many variables. It could be, it could look so different. So weird. So, so when a guy comes along like Leonardo Davinci and you look at his stuff and you go, fuck God damn, this dude nail it. He just nailed it. He spent all his time studying motion and, and visual effects that he has no books filled with how the water looks, when it's misty, how the water looks, when it's rough, how the water looks, when it's a tempest, when there's a storm, when it's calm, when like

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       he felt like artists should walk around and watch people all the time. He had insane notebooks of every kind of movement of every kind of person of every and the physiognomy ones. I just saw when I was in Scotland, they had, and then a museum there when I was at Edinburgh and we went and saw all of his physiological notebooks and there was all these uh, anatomists. Now talking about this is more advanced than what we do. Look at the perspective on how each of the hands, he had corpses and he just spent days and weeks and months and years fucking studying out the tendons worked and drawing these intricate and unbelievably anatomically correct from shaded perspectives, you know, from many perspectives, not just, you know, just so that he could have almost like a database visual. Yeah. His visual cognition. It's just like far past any, but I think it was because he made a study of every, which is why I think he determined that you could make machines that will fly in. I don't think it was great leaps of imagination. He studied birds, you know, and he studied everything. Like he was a, they didn't call it science then, but you know, as a scientist. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:53:48       That's the thing is that he wasn't really bogged down by an a title so much as he would be today. Being an art. I mean it's hard to be an artist and an inventor today unless you're like Kanye West. He can do

Speaker 4:          01:53:58       both. Oh, and a holy figure. The smaller spiritual leader from my, my thing here, people, the props people, the proofs or so per person. Do you guys call each other the pupil Lupus Pruett balloons. We watched Prue Lu, uh, wheat for proofs. Um, and our slogan is don't look back. Something might be proofing on.

Speaker 3:          01:54:20       Is that your a theme? It is our thing. Sorry, I'm still hurting at that ground. Zero. That cassette away way back in 1988 tonic. So sad. She was hot as fuck. Super Hot.

Speaker 4:          01:54:31       Damn. Well that was when she got in front of them and print a crotch in his face while he was driving. That was the part of the video. Like someone's gonna get hurt. It's all fun and games when someone's got their skip and your face,

Speaker 3:          01:54:40       until women just looked different back then with the crazy hair and the men had the crazy hair too crazy hit both crazy hair. Remember she was on a Jaguar? Oh yeah. Flipping around the jailer and unforgettable and doing the splits and shit.

Speaker 4:          01:54:57       I know what it means to walk along.

Speaker 3:          01:55:01       Yeah. There's a lonely road or something like that. Just dreams, but not, there's the music of that era that was like what happened to America? What happened to the world? What happened to the consciousness of the human beings? Is it because they were denied psychedelics? I really wonder because if you look at the difference between the music in the 1970s from 1970 to the music of the 1980s there's some weird sort of a, like a detached gets more Koki and less, less jugging. Yeah, and it's this weird detachment, but from, from real, you know, if you go back to this day, like listen to Voodoo child, listen to the live version of it, how organic it, it's insane. It's insane how good fucking song is. It's insane how good that guitar solo is. It like hurts your brain but then go and listen to some shit from the 80s you know, that was like really popular back then that you might've liked and you'll be like, what the fuck was wrong with these people?

Speaker 3:          01:56:00       Like she'll look at the movies they made. You'll look at, look at the movies they made, some of the movies they made in the 80s and then go back and think about some of the shit they made in the sixties and seventies and it still holds up today. Like the hustler, you know, things that reflect the human condition instead of weird science. There's some, there were some amazing Gainey's feeds back then. There were some amazing like who's afraid of Virginia Woolf still holds up. Oh yeah. It still holds up. Well writing, you know, writing and characters. Right, but why did that go away? Why didn't that get better? Everything gets better. If you look at today's era, if you look at like from if you go back to like father knows best and then you look at today with like say like homeland or the game of Thrones, the writing has gotten so much better.

Speaker 3:          01:56:45       The shows we've gotten so much better. There's such an incredible like evolution of culture that's so blatantly obvious on, on television. Yeah. So why doesn't that exist for what happens? Where's that blip? That weirdness from from the 70s to the eighties to the nineties and two thousands they like finally like rock the shit back straight and got Jesus, what the fuck are we doing? And now they're making all this amazing shit. But they were making amazing shit. They were making the twilight zone. They were, they had really original interest in programming in twilight zone is fucking brilliant to this day. Scifi plays repeats and I set it, set it on my Dvr, wants just thinking this would be fun. Something to watch one night and I'm bored and I'm just hooked. Watching walling after the, I watched three, four in a row. They're amazing. They're so good. They all have three writing is so good and they're concise.

Speaker 3:          01:57:38       Captain Kirk, when William Shatner was, when he was going through that, uh, the machine that tells you your future. Yeah. Oh my God. That's a good episode. I love that show. Burgess Meredith. Oh, that one survives the end of the world. Don't forget. Oh my God. It's incredible. I don't even want to give us, can you say, spoiler alert on a twilight zone from 1963 he can because I find that, I think I talk about things on my show that I think, well, everybody knows this and then he [inaudible]. Everybody doesn't know. Everybody's frame of reference is different than people at different ages and they didn't grow up with that. Sell peep. There's people out there listening right now who are like twilight tone. What does this show you speak of? They don't even know about the movies. This purchase Meredith you speak of are just married and just married man. Yeah, he, yeah. Spoiler alert. He played a guy that really wanted books. Just be alone. I can't tell you anymore. [inaudible] you anymore. The other great. William Schachter. One man on the plane. Yeah. Fuck. That was crazy. The fucking outfit is so bad.

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       It's just terrible. So bad. Yes. Tara, we played it on the podcast. We showed the clip of the monster, the monster, like a monkey with a helmet on. Kind of. It's a furry, yeah, he's a furry. It really does the of for if you haven't seen it, Brian Polo Shit up man. On the wing of the plane. William Shatner. Twilight zone. Just images.

Speaker 1:          01:59:03       Yeah. Incredible. But just the, the sheer originality. Like they were on to something and then you know, later you got the fall guy. Like what happened? They get sued. He got, you know, some stupid shit, man. Older girls, some good show. Magnum Pi was a good cognitive cop drama. He sort of had a message and you know, he was a guy like searching for truth. Look at this fucking thing. Ah, look how bad that thing is. There's some other images, Bri, where it's actually on the plane where you get a whole body. Oh, it's us do. There it is to the left over. That is, oh my God, that's stupid. Yeah. Why was it a furry?

Speaker 1:          01:59:47       That is the least scary thing that's ever been a scary part was just that you'd be looking at your, I think that the jet plane experience was so sexy and exciting in the early sixties so like, oh my God, there's a monster on the way. Well that was actually a propeller plane. Oh, is it? Yeah. That's a propeller plane. The guy actually puts his fingers in the propeller and gets it and hurts his finger and he's like, stop it. Oh, he's so nice. He said that. Yes. He was like poking at the, uh, the, the helicopter blade propeller assignments. You know, that's not the same amount on that. I am the same animal. That's you. That's me. Cute little dog. That's a little crippled Lebanon. Yeah. Well what, I mean I just wonder what happened that, that weird cultural blip. The eighties essentially it's the eighties where it seems like things just, it really does feel like there was like a slide, like, like, oh, like, like the culture got rocked and for like a decade and how to recover.

Speaker 1:          02:00:43       And then through the nineties is like biggie getting its feet back under it and you start seeing like really good comedy and a lot of good things start happening and then boom, it's bad. I don't know. I liked the A's, but yeah, I know what you're saying. It wasn't the deepest decade of all Tom, although in the 70s everybody kept calling it the me decade and that we were really shallow and I kind of enjoyed the 70 shares. Yeah, well the eighties were a big coke era. You're definitely right about that. I wasn't that cookie then, but yes, it was. And I think everything was informed by that. Yeah. And also there's the rise of like capitalist heroes, which I always hated Gordon Gekko types. Yeah. And the whole Reagan thing, and I dunno, I just, I never dragged out part. You've always, well, you're from San Francisco and you're super liberal, man. Yeah. No matter what, you'll always be super liberal. That's true. This is, I'm waiting for the tweeters. He had a true off, you know, I didn't tune in. I didn't pay no money to gene in and listen to this for free to hear proofs jockeys fucking fruity bag shit. Well your points of view are all based

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       on, you know, a pretty, very pretty reasonable ethical standard and your ideas are all, you know, very progressive, open minded. I didn't, you're not a ridiculous person. I've known you for a long time. You're, you're very well thought out and all the things that you say when there's some people though that also pulled opinion similar to yours that need to be throttled.

Speaker 4:          02:02:01       I couldn't agree more there on my team and I don't want them on my team and that's why I don't like my team and that's why I try to stay on my own team because I'd act ya this George Carlin said I'm on the sidelines. You know, there's

Speaker 3:          02:02:12       no doubt there's some annoying as fuck people on the right as well. But something makes me really upset when I find like really aggressive progressive people like overly aggressive progressive, the point of like causing like arguments that are totally unnecessary and feeling completely in the right for doing it. It's like really loud and Barky version of progressive ideology. It's like,

Speaker 4:          02:02:37       well, also I like, I like a little more open minded as to let, she liked to be the overriding notion, not my way. Right in your way and strong. Like I would have smoking in bars. I don't see that as wrong. It's a health issue.

Speaker 3:          02:02:52       You say that because you smoke and I think you enjoy it and I am all for personal choice. I'm all for, you should be allowed to have a bar.

Speaker 4:          02:02:59       That's what I say. What I meant was I would have bars with smoking and then bars without smoking. I think the devil could do that. Would you or were you allowed to do that before? Were you allowed to say no smoking in your establishment before the laws changed? I remember a comedy club. Oh, and they witness who came in on the road. Let's, nevermind this. Looking at you a million different issues of uh, but this, the legal age of drinking, if he can vote when you're 18 then why is it 21 to drink and would

Speaker 3:          02:03:27       you be able to go to war when you're seven? Thank you. And you, you can't, you kill some money, but you can't like figure out whether or not this is ego that's ego or this has beneficial that he should be informed. I think eventually, hopefully, and I've said this to Ad Nauseum, I think we're going to be able to vote on the Internet. We're going to see a radically different version of what people want and don't want. And that's the only way this country has ever really going to be at peace. That's the only way people are ever going to really be at peace. We need like a council of elders, a council of wise men that that sort of display th they, they get on television and with no vested interest educate people on what's wrong with the system and how the world works and what direction they advise that we act.

Speaker 3:          02:04:12       Then the people just vote on everything that fucking happens and everybody gets to do it on your fucking phone and yes, there's gonna be some disastrous results. Miley Cyrus would probably be the first president, but we'll work that shit out. We'll figure out what's not fuckers like that. They're always going to be that. But we'll figure that out eventually. And with the education and the access to information that's also available because of this, I don't think we really completely wrapped her head around the impact. The Internet has honest. No. We look at the stuff from like, I'm watch this documentary searching for sugar man. Yeah, I saw it. It really interesting. Right. And I just started it. It was only a 40 minute plane ride from San Francisco this weekend, but when I was listening, which has happened, Brian would just to, what happened, one of the lights is was making some noises.

Speaker 3:          02:05:03       Oh, okay. That was, yeah, those weird, it's the one under the table here near me. Yeah. But what was fascinating was watching that, that V, I mean it's a real time machine. When you look at the footage of the use and that film of like driving around Detroit in the 1970s beautifully, beautifully shot, but you get this sense of this, this weirdness of that time, you know that just be, and then you just stop and think about the life that we're living right now and how fucking weird that's going to be from people in the future when they try to digest like these were the first motherfuckers to have the Internet, right? The, the whole world as the Internet now we're so used to it cause it's been here for 500 years, but back then the world went upside down. The government started falling, people started getting access to information.

Speaker 3:          02:05:48       Religion started declining and previously never before reported numbers. But the point where there's real legitimate scientific studies that say within the next hundred years, there may not be any religion. Like it may be like a really rare thing. Like that's how crazy the world is moving. That's how fast it's moving and that's how much things are changing. They're just changing in front of our eyes to the point where it's, it's, it's just a normal part of everyday life. Hey, I don't know, Google it. You boop, boop, tweet me. Oh my God, I've got to retweet that. It's crazy story. Bam, and then everybody else does it. Then you've got millions of people that are doing it to each other, sending it and sending it and sending that that, that new distribution of information that can't be underestimated that that's on a world changer. It's a world changer. We didn't have it 10 years ago.

Speaker 3:          02:06:34       No, 10 years ago fit 10 native, but it wasn't as like this, this is, this is so beneficial. 20 years ago. No Way. Not at all. There's a lot of cons online for sure, but you can find some really cool pockets of people online to some really Nice, interesting, friendly people. There's a gang of message boards. There's a gang of, of people that you can connect to on Twitter, so really unique time, like is it the amount of people that you interact with? I think that it's more people kind of availed themselves of what a tool it is. You can learn a lot off your computer or your phone or you can, but people don't ease it for that. They just go on Facebook or, yeah, so a lot of that. Well, that's so easy. I need my own personal porn blocker when someone comes over my house and I have to show them something.

Speaker 3:          02:07:29       My Youtube, I have to type Y o u t very quickly because it wants to go to [inaudible]. You know how like I predict at least it's huge is and not something else and that's, yeah, you suck my cock. Oh yeah. I like it in jail. You Ooh, I like it up my butt. This whenever you want end to end. Right now. We can keep going. We can do whatever we want. I could go, there's no reason you can go. You can leave or you could go. You could talk. No, I probably should go pretty soon. You should leave pretty early. We can stop. We've been doing like couple hours. I got a couple of hours, right? Yeah. Well, you don't want a cine that even it's too, I've been two hours, about two hours, two hours and almost 15 minutes. Yeah, that's a nice long length for podcasts. I was enjoyable. We did with the last thing I ever want it to be is not enjoyable anymore. So like when your time is up, but when you look at career clock and you go, hmm, I gotta be somewhere. We just have to look at them. We just have became a man and a bestowed your, your, your beautiful wisdom upon us.

Speaker 4:          02:08:27       Thanks for having me again. Thank you for letting me annually come back and talk about Columbus ad nauseum. You can come back anytime you want and talk about the same shit over and over again and I don't give a fuck. I appreciate it. Joe. Your show is very intellectually engaging and a, I don't think there's anything like it, uh, of all the shows because uh, you know, you're willing to explore any and all areas and uh, and uh, and take on a lot of different philosophies in this. Yeah, there's no question and answer. It's fantastic. It's just a free flowing

Speaker 3:          02:08:58       well, there's so much out there in the world. I think at this point in time, there's so many different things to think about in so many different subjects to cover and so many different fascinating things to discuss. And as long as you discuss it like that, you know of you, you, you just, you just look at things objectively and openly and you try not to have any personal biases going into them and try to look at every different angle. The world is a fascinating, fascinating, fascinating place. There's just, it's, I think we're in this weird boiling time. It's like never before seen

Speaker 4:          02:09:28       summation. I feel panicked and I feel uh, chased and I feel, you know, yeah. I think everybody does that right now is a real weird feeling in the air.

Speaker 3:          02:09:39       Yeah. I worry about the everything across the board from the ocean, right to the, the melting and the polar ice caps. I worry about the, the threat of war. I worry about drone attacks. I worry about nuclear disasters. There's so much that can go wrong, but yet it's still so exciting. Oh, of course. There's the amazing time to be alive. We're so lucky. There's always the sun in the man, you know? There's so much shit going on, man. There's so much awesome comedy going on. There's so many funny people and great movies and there's just so much great music and like the, I think our culture right now this time were people like anybody can just enter into the fray, write a blog, make some music, put it up online. She made people share it, right? The show us, show us your comedy, put it up online.

Speaker 3:          02:10:22       People share it. I mean this, this times, it's never been anything like this. The rules are off. That's the best part. Yeah. The rules are off and it's being used in [inaudible] ways in some sometimes, but overall the, I think that's going to settle down. I really do. I have faith in people. I might be unwarranted faith. I have faith in people based in what I've seen from, from friends, their, you know, their emotional and physical growth and what I've seen from more emotional obviously, but, and when I've seen from our culture, I think that's one of the weird things about who we are right now is the fact that we're in the middle of all this chaos and all this war and all this, all the, all the racism and sexism and all this devastating shit that we have. On top of that, we also have information that's flowing like a raging river and no one can stop including the government.

Speaker 3:          02:11:17       No one can stop it. And people were organizing things and there's some attempts that morning, you know, like there's some occupy Wall Street things that like, it's a great idea and they're focusing on this area, but we're not exactly sure what happens. But then there's anonymous that goes after people. And then there's, there's bitcoin guy who they just, uh, they just, uh, arrested who was running that um, uh, Silk Road, Silk Road. He lost all his bitcoins, right? They took all his bitcoin. Bitcoin's just went out of business. Get coins went out of business too. I think so. I think it's the whole thing she does. I think that was my croquet mallet collection. These things to me, I would like like the medical marijuana of 1994 it's like once you open up the door to that, give it 10 years and watch what the fuck you guy. You're going to have something crazy 10 years later after that 2013 what did they have? Yeah, it fucking madness. The streets of Los Angeles. Every way you look as a fucking pot store. Everywhere you look is a billboard with a doctor that's willing to prescribe [inaudible] for anything. My favorite ones on a Melrose, I've been doing this for eight plus years. It says the doctor I'd been giving out prescriptions for potheads.

Speaker 3:          02:12:26       That's so fun, isn't it? It's fantastic. Yeah. No, you're right man. You're right. I think that's the exciting part of being alive. Cause then I get through the news and Shit on my shit and then people could go. It's so depressing Greg. There's no future. And I'm like, oh, there's loads of future. And I always feel like the editing is the hidden element or not so hidden. Um, young people of today don't have the same mindset. So in 20 years time, all of what we think is real and what's happening isn't happening anymore. And I think that's exciting too. They don't give a shit about gay marriage or any of these sticky issues that were still hung up on. Nah, like shutting the government down. The government of 2040 is the same. Government is today and dead without a doubt. Yeah. I mean there's some people I'm sure in [inaudible], but there's less and less dummies now.

Speaker 3:          02:13:08       I think as people realizing that there's this, there's an impact for the douchey sexism or homophobia or whatever it is that they're doing, there's an impact. That impact hurts other people. When you say concrete things to people, it affects them. When you have an attitude about people, it affects them and then other people affect you, they show displeasure of you, and then you sort of get a balance. I think that's what the, the distribution of information does. It allows people to even things out a little bit easier. And I think it also ultimately as he ultimately, it's going to make me feel more kind because right now they're able to do things with without warrior the consequences because they can do things anonymously like you Facebook and things along those lines. I don't know how much longer that's going to last. It doesn't seem like it's going to last that much longer.

Speaker 3:          02:13:53       It seems like eventually people are gonna know who you are. If you're posting things and then people are going to be able to comment if they know who you are, they're going to be able to go. Why did you say that to that guy? That was fucking unbelievably douchey. Like, hey man, the way you handled that as wrong, or hey, I really liked the way you handled that. Or Hey, you know, I really loved how you diffuse that situation. You know, and then we're going to get a lot more feedback from a lot more different people. Yeah, we're in for some strange times. Greg proof.
