Speaker 1:          00:00          Did you ever do that in studio? I feel like our thing cause you do sex and candy. No, no, no. I know I did. Do you want that? You want to know, okay, this is my version of the songs by the way, when I covered so many songs I just, I just Kinda do what I think it is. That song was a song that I liked the first few times and it came out. I thought it was interesting because I'd never heard a song like that and um, I kind of grew up. But you, your version of it, it's very different. It's a little bit faster I think. Well it's cooler. It's a good song, man. I, that's a very good song. I liked it a lot is when I often like warm myself up with. So yeah. But again, this is my version and you know, if I butcher it up, y'all just going to have to dig it like that. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          03:00          My spin match. I could understand the words in that. Like there's, there's a bunch of the words in that other one where I don't know what the fuck who was saying devious stairs in my direction now. I know. I thought it was like beefeater stairs and my direction somewhere. I know I threw a really bad cold somewhere. Please. It was beautiful. Kept it moving so hopefully it did work. I love the slang that I smell. They're real slow and they do it too. Like you know, it's real. I think the guy who was singing that song, the original dude, it's a great version, but it's the version of a is trying to get laid. He's like, he's trying to be sexy. It's being a little sexy. He's working on it. I fuck. You'll still get laid and it is a sexy song. It is very sexy fucking sexy song. If you imagine what Saks and candy would actually smell like, though, that'd be a fucking weird gummy bears and yeast infections. I was thinking snickers bars and bleach
