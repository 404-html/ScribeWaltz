Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. I'm not, you know, I don't, I don't spend a lot of time with, with other water unless there, there were those who were deeply admire who I see every now and again, like Sebastian younger. Um, but I'm not, I don't, I don't hang out with them day in, day out. So there's levels to the involvement. Yeah. To weather how deeply you're immersed. And it's, it's, it's completely upside down in the state because the TV, new Gen TV news journalists aren't deeply involved and just want to get that quick shot of them looking like they're somewhere Middle East and he closest to the front line with the flak jacket on the perfectly ironed shirt and they're not, they're not sweating or even worse. The Brian Williams type situation. Yeah, yeah. Or on the roof of the five star hotel. Sometimes you might see people report about what's happening with Isis and they're in Beirut.

Speaker 1:          00:44          Right. And I think they're relying on the fact that a lot of people don't understand that's a different country. Um, but you know, those guys, some of those guys are paid millions and treated very, very well. The photographers and print journalists who are immersed and last spending weeks there, I sometimes struggling to make a living and aren't well known and aren't well supported. What is it about the talking head in front of the camera that we want so badly? I mean I think it's, it's, it's a way for the news networks to, to, you know, claim credibility and then when you see them get deployed, they're not focused on getting material from the war in these countries. They're focused on the, on the two way, right? [inaudible] shark guy from wherever. Right. That's more important than actually spending days collecting footage of what's actually going on.

Speaker 1:          01:29          It seems like you see that rarely if ever these days it's more and more rare. It, it seemed to me that during like Desert Storm, um, in the 90s there was always someone that was over there and it seemed like there was real threat and it was really going on. But now everything seems to be done from the desk and you don't really see a lot of, I mean, am I right about that? Yeah. I mean, I think emotional, a lot of the major news networks said to their crews, you're not allowed to spend the night in Mosul. You know, you can go there and film a street, interview some refugees who just escaped isis territory, but you can't spend days on end there. Whereas the freelance photographers and some of the writers, they were spending days on end there and getting, getting the real stuff. Is it because the on camera people will be targeted?

Speaker 1:          02:14          Um, I just think the risk is too high, full stop for the entire crew. And certainly if you know, when a story is really big and you send one of the very well known correspondence there, then yeah, they can't be running around, you know, filming house to house fighting. So when you're over there and you see these guys show up and you know that they're just going to be hanging out with the hotel and what does that feel in like, uh, yeah, I mean, I'm pretty disdainful of those. Yeah. Those guys you have to be, yeah. Yeah. You see these films like, um, whiskey, tango, Foxtrot about Afghanistan and I just, yeah, I just don't recognize that that world, you know, partying every night at whatever bar or restaurant. I just, I just think if you're there and you're obviously in the wrong place, right, right.

Speaker 1:          02:55          And it's not, it's not an adventure, you know, it's not a fun trip for you of, of wild times and you know, it's, it shouldn't be that. It should be, um, I mean from, it feels like an endurance test every time you go. It should be hard and you should be spending time with the people you're covering. And you know, sometimes you can, you can think you're finished with someone and just go for dinner or tea. And just by having normal human conversations, you find out so much other stuff that you didn't go there to report. You know, that's, that's, that's what you have to be doing. And that takes weeks, weeks of getting closer to them and gain their trust. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And just, just, just, you know, spending enough time there where you, you then end up being in the right place at the right time to show something really happening.

Speaker 1:          03:34          Yeah. It was unfortunate that I had to take that from him and I kind of, in a sense, I felt like I was taken away from what he was doing for them. So when I saw her walking backstage, I just couldn't control it. I just let, I just let go and I just can help but cry on her shoulders. Disagree. It's a great video. What is her name was woman's actresses. Roma Downey. Yeah, that's her right there. The video is amazing cause she's hugging you and she's Talon you. Congratulations. And she's telling you that they're coming, they're going to be coming for you. So train hard. Yeah. And it's just like her attitude, man. It's beautiful, man. It's, it's, um, it's amazing her character that she handled that. I mean, this is her baby. Her baby just lost and lost every round and it was a, you know, pretty dominant victory by you and for her to treat you that way afterwards to shows amazing character. Yeah. And it's, Sarah is right here. You can see it up here. Look at her. She just embraces you. Open arms. It's all good. It's all good baby. Look at that.

Speaker 2:          04:34          Oh, amazing. That's an amazing woman right there. He bought work a couple of phone calls. So you take it too. Oh good. Wow.

Speaker 1:          04:51          That's amazing man. And even Tyron, the way tire and here, it's crazy, right? It makes me cry. Something in the air over here. I've got to do it. I got it made me cry when I saw it. It's making me cry now. Yeah, man. Um, and in the way she treated tire into the same thing. I mean, she's just, that's, and that, that's, that's kind of, that's how my mom is to that. So I felt such a connection to that to her because my mom has the exact same way. My mom would have done the same thing to Tyron. And um, it just, it was powerful, man. It was moving. And because it's, and it goes through a test to how the sport has, how bay this sport is as well. Yeah. Like it's not all man, that's just a regular fight. You guys hate each other and you were fighting. No, this was a competition. Yeah. You know, this was two men that went in there too for a competition and one guy, one and you know, and you saw the aftermath is see the family receive each other. Yeah. People loved that man. They love when people put all that bullshit aside. I mean, you guys had a lot of trash talk at the press conferences and there was a lot of that going on, but that tickets and

Speaker 3:          05:57          it's good for everybody and it's, it's natural and normal. But after it was over, it was nothing but respect. Can I, can I pause here? Leptin is produced where? Yeah, Leptin is produced. Yeah. Let's talk about linkedin a little bit. It's produced in fat cells, um, and it's produced in proportion to the size of fat tissue. So the amount of body fat you have, the more fat you have, the more Leptin you have in the circulation. And basically what this is, it's what's called a negative feedback loop, which is a really simple engineering term that works like a thermostat. So with your Thermostat, you uh, if you set your thermostat to 70, if it starts getting a little bit hotter, your ac turns on to bring it back down at the starts getting lower, ac comes on or the heat comes on to bring it up.

Speaker 3:          06:45          That's called a negative feedback system and it maintains the stability of the temperature of your house. We have many negative feedback loops in the human body to regulate body temperature, to regulate blood pressure, to regulate all sorts of things. One of the negative feedback loops we have regulates body fatness and the hormones. So your, your thermostat measures temperature by using a thermostat, a Saria, a thermometer, your brain measures body fatness using this hormone leptin that's in the circulation. And then particularly when your body fat level drops, your Leptin levels drop and your brain hears that and it kicks in a starvation response basically. And this is the main reason why weight loss is so difficult because your brain is like, no, I don't want to be losing fat. And it makes you hungrier. It increases your cravings at a certain level of body fat as a sub.

Speaker 3:          07:39          Um, so here's is just when you're losing body fat in general, like even if you're a large person that's overweight, correct. When you're losing body fat in general, your body, it exacerbates your hunger. And this is, this is the thing that's really important to understand about obesity is that people with obesity have a higher set point. So it's like turning your thermostat from 70 to 80 and then your thermostats and regulating around 80 people with obesity, they're not regulating around one 70 anymore. They're regulating around two 50 and so when you cause a lean person to lose weight, you see the same thing is when you cause a person with obesity to lose weight, you see this reaction in their brain circuits that regulate body fatness that drives them to increase their cravings and their hunger to metabolic rate drops. So it'd be an evolutionary mechanism to force you to seek food. Correct. And not just the foresee to seek food, that's the main thing. But it also slows your metabolic rate, does everything it can to get more energy in your body and have less leaving. And it keeps doing that until the fat comes back. Can I pause here? Yeah. So when you're eating a sugary diet, a high, high calorie diet, you will produce more fat. Your body will get fatter, right? It depends on how many calories you're eating. If you're overeating, you consuming a lot of sugar,

Speaker 4:          08:56          a lot of carbohydrates, your body will get fatter. Correct. So your body will produce more Leptin. Correct. So it comes from the Diet. Um, yeah. Indirectly. Definitely not. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          09:05          Yeah. Pause please. Yeah. I played the nine holes of golf with him. Was it like, and uh, it was, well, there's still security secret service all around it. And so it was a private golf course. Uh, Larry Ellison a that owns oracle. Oh Wow. Uh, owns this private golf course. It has 14, he's a big tennis guy, so he puts on the tennis stuff out in palm springs and nobody plays his course and he doesn't play golf. And uh, Eh, it's just his practice is to deal [inaudible] course get is. Yeah, he's got his own courses. He played through our group and shadow creek and Beverly Hill, I mean in, in Vegas. It really exclusive course, impossible to get on. And, and he was playing by himself and he was gone the tee box and I said, as lonely at the top area. He goes, yeah. And his ball and went off by himself. And uh, but he wasn't even there but, but Clinton was, and he told me a story goes, his friend of his as a record producer, rap records big. I didn't tell me who it was and didn't tell me who the artist was either. But the artists was all dug down and he was in a Ferrari store and, and uh, and uh, the salesman, he goes, are you thinking about buying this car? And the guy goes, no, I'm going to buy the car. I'm thinking about pussy.

Speaker 5:          10:26          So the Glen told me a story that had the word [inaudible] in it. And Clinton Clinton told me that. That's a great fucking story. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          10:36          So, so Nietzsche and Schopenhauer talked about the idea that there's the well, right? So as a human being, you're stuck in this fucking, I got to eat, I've got to fuck, I got to sleep and I got to breed and I eat and I sleep and I fucked so I can breathe, you know, and I can stay alive. And then my, you know, further my gene pool and you're stuck in this kind of like will to live theirs. But there is a response. And that respite is, is when you, when you see a great work of art or you're doing great works of art. And somehow when you see something beautiful, when you're laughing, really hard, equate standard, when you're seeing them an amazing movie like American beauty, the state it puts you in is so incredible because it gets you to forget momentarily about your own biology, about your own urges, your own needs, your own wants for whatever reason you, you rest in this state of majesty, this sort of high relief, this your higher self.

Speaker 4:          11:26          And you go, you go man, that might be what God's about. And that might be what it's like to be touching something bigger than myself or bigger than all of this other appetite stuff. Like I, it's almost like, um, it's almost like something you, you forget that you forget about death and you forget about your fears and everything else. You know, that those feelings of inspiration that can happen when you're listening to great music or it can happen when you're making great music. But that is almost the only time you have. Um, I guess, and of course we can talk about flow and you're climbing a mountain with no ropes or whatever it might be. I think that puts you in those states of true focus and true flow. And, um, that's what we stay alive for. We stay alive for that. And when you are not that, you know, everything else becomes drudgery almost because everything becomes, and I would even, I would even equate like, oh, we stay alive also, not just for our accomplishments, but like when you're with your friends, like when we're doing the fight companion and we're laughing and being silly game for no other reason.

Speaker 4:          12:27          There is a flow to that. Oh yeah. There's a, there's a, you are, you are removed for temporarily from the world, from, from, from the reality of your own limitations. And there, there's something that's so beautiful about that. I think Nietzsche talked about the idea that you can, you can actually make your life that your life should be a work of art, live dangerously and leave a good looking corpse. Don't, don't, don't worry about all the other things. Okay.
