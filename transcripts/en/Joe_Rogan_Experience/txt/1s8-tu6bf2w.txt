Speaker 1:          00:00          A record and Sun. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the broadcast

Speaker 2:          00:08          and we're on right now, which I may get it. So you can see that had twitter for like cooking up twice. That's a terrible way to start off the show. No one heard that shit. What are you talking about? People online right now? There's 100 people online. I'm sure. See how many people we got? 90 four people. Did anybody hear that? Tastes terrible. God Damn Joke. Wow. This is blockies. Fuck. Look how goofy looks. Cool.

Speaker 1:          00:40          Serious fucking delay to what's happening. Eddie and Joe, why don't we come back to Philly. Will be back to philly eventually. Um, I don't know when the UFC is going to be back in Philly, but people have been calling for young Eddie Bravo to be on the Joe Rogan podcast here. Ladies and Gentlemen, there is Eddie Bravo man. There's like a five second delay. It's awkward. Uh, so we're here in Charlotte, North Carolina. Pretty fucking bad ass town. And it, it's nice hair and people are all friendly. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:12          I like it. I like it. I rented a car for the first time coming to a UFC city and you get to know the city a lot better when you have to know what the hell you're going, you know, we're so used to jumping in bands and and just not paying attention and we really don't even know anything about the city. Renting cars is the key.

Speaker 1:          01:30          Yeah. Drive around and get to know the place. I like it here, man. It's real. It's all spread out. It's a, you know, it's like no congestion creep, oral friendly. There's no tension here. It's a good size city. Charlotte's a good size city. It's not too crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:45          Yeah, the super friendly. I drove into the weigh ins and they were charging for parking and since I drove and then go into where the UFC van, I pulled up to the girl taking them on and go, listen, I actually work for the UFC. I just don't have my laminate but I'll pay whatever. She's like, no, just drive right in. I just drove right in. Park went up to. I needed to get back stage and again I didn't have my credentials. So there's like security, they're like North Carolina security. I'm like, I need to get my credentials. Is there any like, I mean, can you direct me to a spot where I could speak to someone because just go backstage and just walked backstage and went right in zero security. Now you're telling stalkers how they could meet providers, you know, next time it's going to Carolina, you have some ammo. Let's. Okay. I can't read this shit too far. He's your eyes bad. Is My eyes bad? Be Bad?

Speaker 1:          02:40          Well, we froze up. Ustream kind of sucks, you know, they all suck at these things because the Internet is not quite ready for this shit yet.

Speaker 3:          02:48          Uh,

Speaker 2:          02:51          so me just answer questions and share what stuff have we done in town. We haven't done shit in town. Really. I went river rafting last Monday.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Last time I had a show at, um, a place called Ms Dot south. Then a lot of fun. Great crowd, good times. Then afterwards it was a gentleman's club down the street. We had to bring some dudes came to my show. They had a two books. They wanted eddy design. It's actually kind of funny story and they wanted a eddie the science books, so we had to get the books over to Eddie, but um, and then we went to a waffle house and fucked up some waffles. Yeah, that was a good times. Good Times my friend. Good Times. What do I think about synthetic cannabis? That's legal. That's kind of interesting. Shit. You know about that man? They have the marinol. No, no, it's a synthetic cannabis. It's like, you know how they had that, uh, when the whole balco scandal came out, what it was, was a steroid that they had made.

Speaker 1:          03:51          It was just slightly different from regular steroids in was undetectable and tests because the regular steroids, what they were looking for in the test, they weren't looking for this stuff. Well that's the same thing with this. There's a synthetic cannabis that you could smoke it as the same effects and it doesn't show up in tests. What does it look like? It looks like wheat and actually it looks like. Wait. Yeah, it looks like not a plant. Yeah. And they just wow. They've just grown it and I mean, it makes sense. I mean they've figured out a way to um, I didn't know about the botanists have figured out a way a long time ago to put thc into other things. They like, there was an article online where there was this guy was trying to put the tomatoes, get tomatoes to grow tac, like they can fuck with plants and have them, you know, you know, different plants produce more vitamin C and different plants do certain things and you know, they're, they're trying to figure out how to make these, uh, I guess they have figured out how to, how to make we'd.

Speaker 1:          04:46          That doesn't show up in drug tests. Pretty crazy. And it's legal. So like if you worked for ups or something like that and they drug test you and you can't smoke weed, you can smoke the fuck out of this stuff. How long has this been out? It's been out for awhile, man. They're trying to make it illegal. It's a big deal. Now we're trying to make it illegal. 30 bitches. So you could sell in any way that they're selling on in high times magazine is where they send all that bullshit. That stuff's not real at all. Yeah. What's up with that shit is wack. That is the weakest shit ever. That fake weed and they sell that is so dumb. But they say that that's like a big part of their advertising revenue. I think that's just because they're fucking lazy. You know, you're telling me that everyone's so afraid of we. They can't advertise their products and your magazine come on, but yet you can sell fake weed. You're just ripping people off. That's all that is. That stuff doesn't get anyone high. But this other stuff does. That sort of stuff is real. Shit. Eddie. Eddie's here. Talk about Ufos already.

Speaker 1:          05:50          Michael Chavela the guy from a k one and you know a dream. You know the Australian dude that we hung out with in Australia, he's A. I'm a big Ufo guy and he was a downtown Roswell Museum and he actually saw a Ufo and took photos of it and shit.

Speaker 4:          06:06          Fuck yeah, that's pretty crazy. I mean, who the fuck knows, man?

Speaker 2:          06:11          You have any UFO questions? Go ahead and shoot.

Speaker 1:          06:17          Did I finish the entire plate of food? You Post on twitter? I finished most of it. I fuck up some food folks, especially after shows after shows like a fuck up some food, you know, as the UFC to burn off a lot of energy. Just talking. It doesn't seem like you would, but you do

Speaker 2:          06:32          that. He actually flap on Saturday. What does that mean?

Speaker 4:          06:39          Oh, oh, he's going down.

Speaker 1:          06:44          Did I watch that train wreck? Prison wives of the Discovery Channel? No. There's a show about chicks whose husbands are in prison. Oh, I might have to see what channel discovery channel. It might be good. Oh, the history channel documentary. I know what I saw. Yeah, I saw that one too. That was kind of interesting.

Speaker 2:          07:04          That was the best documentary I've ever seen on your first. Uh, definitely. I know what I saw. I didn't have. It was one of those rare documentaries that let you have those two. Didn't have like that. The other side, you know, they didn't have a guy going, well you know, it's all just mythology and you know, it's in their minds and they're all crazy and why are they landing in Idaho all the time? Why not in big cities? And they didn't have any of those guys because it was so ridiculous because that's so many high ranking military officers coming forward that one case in England on a US base with that 80 witnesses and three of the guys went up to it and touched it and wrote down notes on it and they all came up in the Ministry of Defense. Totally. They said this is not a concern of national defense. That's what. That's the content. So that is that alone right there. It's pretty crazy. And those Arizona Arizona Lights, I mean people saying there's, I don't know how many witnesses, but

Speaker 1:          08:07          the Arizona life's pretty crazy. I know a dude who lives in Arizona saw that. He said he saw the fucking, the big pyramid thing flying through the air and they sang. It's like bigger than a aircraft carrier football field. He said it was gigantic. You said it was a gigantic, big pyramid shaped thing flying to Scotland. Who the fuck knows, you know, my, my take on Ufo. Um, they've been really were aliens that could come here from another planet. What do you think that there will be so silly that they would, they wouldn't disguise themselves. I think a lot of the shit we see all the time could be Ufo as I told you about that crazy dude that told me that, uh, he was showing me pictures of clouds. There's a dude that I know is a comedian, is a very nice guy and uh, the other day, uh, I'm talking to him at the Improv and a homeboy says, what do you think about Ufo?

Speaker 1:          08:56          And I said, well, you know, hey man, uh, I don't know. I haven't seen one, but I don't discount the idea. I mean it's certainly possible. Obviously we have spaceships and for someone from other planets, if they're more intelligent than us, for sure they could have space ships. So he starts pulling on his iphone and the dude has like dozens of pictures of clouds on his phone. And I'm, I'm like, what, what does that, what do you think about this? We'll get this right there, and I go to cloud. And he goes, yeah, but it's an unusually shaped cloud. Look at it. And I'm like, oh no, he's crazy. I'm like, he's fucking crazy. This dude takes pictures of clouds, all different clouds. And he's convinced that these clouds are Ufos. But at one point on one hand you've got to think like if you really are so superintelligent that you can visit from other planets, why would you, you know, for sure we're working on cloaking devices right now.

Speaker 1:          09:48          There is already this Japanese jacket that's been invented that basically takes an image of what's behind you and broadcast it on the front of the jacket. It's basically like Predator type shit. You remember from the movie the Predator. And they really have this already. I mean it's not perfected, but we can't travel to other planets yet either. You know what I'm saying? So if someone from another planet is so much more highly intelligent than we are, that they can actually travel here from other galaxies are or older other solar systems for sure. They've figured something like this out. So when you're seeing the sky, I mean, it's very possible, you know that what you're seeing is if, if there are Ufo as you would see an image of the sky behind the behind the UFL being projected onto you. So you wouldn't see shit, you know, that said you, if you could take into account how many Ufos are reported. I mean, it's like there's some ridiculous amount of, of Ufo is reported and if you take into account how many people see and don't report, they don't say anything because they want to look foolish. You know, that's a, that's a lot of Goddamn Ufo. False. I think a lot of what people are seeing is military jets that they don't understand. Like when I was in, um, we did fear factor down near Edwards air force base and they had stealth bombers flew up. Dude, you, you see a stealth bomber. You think that's a goddamn space. Yet,

Speaker 2:          11:06          yeah, the French government did a test with some. There was a serious, a review of all the. There's like 50,000 or something, something 50,000 since certain year there's probably way more, but they came to the conclusion that I'm 95 percent of reported cases can be explained away with that, like military others, high ranking military or this top secret military planes and different lights, but they said five percent, most likely our aircraft from other worlds.

Speaker 1:          11:42          Well, I don't know why they can say aircraft from other worlds because I don't necessarily think we have a. it's more likely to take inventory of what exists in this moment.

Speaker 2:          11:51          They're saying they're saying that that's

Speaker 1:          11:54          probably what that is. More of. The more likely it's some extraterrestrial craft then. I mean they got. There's five percent of it. Just because it's not from our government or the Russian government doesn't necessarily mean even as from another planet. We don't know what the fuck is in the ocean. No, no, no. It's a lot of Ufo is get cited. Called. There was a whole a history channel documentary about that and people go, well, that's ridiculous. That's nonsense. That's silly. It's silly that you can set a fucking picture that you could take this fucking thing and send a video across the sky into somebody else's phone in Australia. That's way more silly than some people from another planet have visited here or that there's something living in the ocean,

Speaker 2:          12:35          especially when you have guys like x Pentagon, high ranking officials like Philip Corso, who before he died, he wrote a book and he explained his job in the government in the Pentagon was taking crashed ufo stuff, taking it to like a Hughes aircraft and Lockheed and all these different aerospace companies to reverse engineer. He's saying he was like, there's many interviews on youtube with Philip course. He's dead now. He was on dateline and they try to like, ridicule, but you know, um, how do you.

Speaker 1:          13:09          J Dot Allen Hynek too is another excellent example that jail. And Hank was the guy who was in charge of project blue book and he was told to by the government when they had this thing to explain away everything, swamp gas, you know, a mass hysteria, anything they could do to explain away ufo cases, but as he became more involved in project blue book and as he investigated more and more sightings and you know, and dealt with more and more evidence, he became absolutely convinced that you have. Those were real. So Jay Allen Hynek, who was, you know, a guy actually working to discredit ufo eventually came out and started a supporting the whole Ufo movement. So I think it's, it's not, it's not ridiculous to think that we've been visited. I mean we go to the Congo all the time and stare at chimpanzees, you know, I mean if you were from another planet and you had the ability to travel here, why wouldn't you check out people?

Speaker 1:          13:58          People are fucking completely ridiculous. They're probably fascinating. I mean, what would be more. We studied lower forms of animals. We always have. And we have been doing this since the beginning of time. I mean, people, people have always been interested in botany and we've always been interested in studying different monkeys and in different weird animals and other. I mean that's the whole thing with Darwin, you know, he took a, you know, it took a, an account of all these different animals that he came across. We've always done shit like that and I think if we were a much higher intelligence than human beings, we would want to do that with people would want to check out and see what the fuck people are up to see if people are evolving, see what the bottleneck is as far as like social and cultural evolution and see what the bottleneck is as far as technological evolution and whether or not our technology is surpassing our, our ability as a human being like too to make rational decisions. And I think it probably is right now. You know, they just fired up the large Hadron collider yesterday. You know, yesterday was the first test

Speaker 2:          15:01          north who is watching,

Speaker 1:          15:05          what is that equal out too? I think that looks like a nail due to reno. I don't know, it looks like a whole hot to, you don't know a hot is a, is a Portuguese Brazilian guy say pull out all the time. It's like, it sort of means like fuck or balls. It means like a bunch of different things. They say it all the time. Ms Dot bawls. I think it just a budges yeah, yeah. I heard a bunch of different translations, but to me too is the fighting vampire, you know what I mean? Is a famous bar, gracie black belt and um, I guess he looks like Dracula or something. So I called him last. He's the Brazilian vampire. That's funny. Am I not going to accommodate? Yeah, I'm going to compensate. That shit's in the. I'm going to leave in a half an hour. We're chilling here in the hotel room. We're getting ready to go down there and commentate. Yeah. I'm like, what do I think about scientology? I think it's awesome if you're gay and you want to cover it up and they're really good at that shit. It's all nonsense. All, all religions are nonsense. You know? You know, just as much as I know as far as like what happens when you die. No one knows.

Speaker 2:          16:23          I didn't let you know what. I think religion is awesome if you do it right, if you do it right, if you do the right thing and help your neighbors. Like my grandma was hardcore Catholic and I wouldn't try to convince her like if she was still allowed to get out of that, she was doing. She was going to church every day and that praying is like meditating. She was meditating. So I think just like having the healthy heart. You could. Some people can do kettlebells, some people could run on a treadmill, some people run stairs, some people do martial arts. That's for a healthy heart and it all works. And I think religion, whether you're doing the Jesus or the ally or the Buddha or meditation or yoga, it doesn't really matter. As long as you get your frequency at the right spot with the universe.

Speaker 2:          17:06          It doesn't matter if you do the Jesus thing, you know? So I think that. I think you're right. I think whatever you, whatever it gets you in that right frequency, you can worship your iphone. If you actually believe that and you can meditate to your iphone, I think the universe don't give a fuck. They're like, how are you going to get to our frequency? That's all that. My real problem is people. The real problem is the same. Do you know what it is? It's the same thing when whenever, when someone believes in something, even if they believe in something completely irrational, they want everyone else to believe in it, to everyone else to be on their team. That's why like if you ever talked to people that use windows and they find out that you use Mac and they're like, what the fuck man, I use Mac for faggots and then he crazy like they want you to use windows and it's like want you to be

Speaker 1:          17:50          Muslim? They want you to be a scientologist. They want you to be a Catholic. You know, that's the real problem is that people want you to, to

Speaker 4:          17:57          two

Speaker 1:          17:58          subscribed to their ideology, but the idea behind it, you know, being a better person and you know, and treating everybody as if they're yourself and you know that all that, that's the way to go. I mean, it really is, but the fucking handing out the basket and fucking kids and all that other shit that, you know, involved in relationships with kids. I have to admit I'm not into that. I'm against that. I saw that deliver us from evil. They recommended. Come on. He recommended this documentary and you guys should check it out to. It's called deliver us from evil. If you want to find out how fucked up the Catholic Church really is. Oh my God. Is this incredible? Yeah. Well, I couldn't watch the whole thing. I've watched about an hour and 10 minutes to get to the point where it turns out that guy's done like hundreds of kids.

Speaker 1:          18:41          Yeah. I couldn't take it. I wanted to kill him. I, I mean, it's, it's really a really sick, sick documentary about this priest who is responsible for molesting hundreds of kids and you know, they covered it up. They kept moving on, they moved them all over the country and uh, really it's incredible. And that's what's going on right now. That gigantic scandal that's happening right now with the pope. The pope had knowledge of all this fucking shit that was going on. There's so many pedophiles, not all pedophiles. I bet they're all pedophiles because it was just because it was, if it was just, if it was half of them or a quarter home, there would be busting each other out. They would, there would be people coming forward saying, we've got to stop this shit. They're all covering each other's asses. I mean, think about it there. They chose a job where they can get any pussy.

Speaker 1:          19:34          Well, the whole idea, you know what I mean? That's got to drive you insane. And anybody who accepts a job where you can get laid that you gotta be fucked up already. You already got. And I think my, my theory is that when these guys grow up gay, they're relieved, they're grown up in a religious home. That. And then once they find out they're gay, they realize, Oh shit, maybe Satan is inside of me. I got these gay feelings. Oh my God, I gotta fight. Same. So they become ultra religious, ultra Catholic, and then they're trying to prove to God that they're going to fight the gay. They're gonna devote their life to God. They become a priest and then Bam, they hold it together for years. And then they lose it. You ever seen that video? God hates fags. No. The Guy who, uh, who's a gay guy who was singing about being Christian, never seen that going to sign that shit. You know what I gotta get the fuck out of here. I got to leave my man. We don't have to leave for 20 minutes. We leave the shower stuff. Yeah. But the fights don't even start for more than hour.

Speaker 1:          20:28          And I got to get my hair did. Come on, man. You're here. It looks like you got to check this out and people don't get to see you on Youtube. How long it takes to blow dry my hair.

Speaker 4:          20:35          Know how much you don't have to wash it here. Ten minutes. Now.

Speaker 1:          20:43          Got to find this video because it's so ridiculous. It's a dude who's a gay dude who's fighting

Speaker 5:          20:48          against it and he says, Jesus is the only man for me. It's just genius. Hold on. It's like A. Those guys at Bora Bora Bora bought Bruno fucks with God. Hates fags on it's real. This is a real song. You have to see this because it's so god damn genius.

Speaker 4:          21:07          This guy was the guy. Here it is.

Speaker 5:          21:12          This is a real soft.

Speaker 4:          21:17          First of all, his mustache. A lot. Hold on, let me put this up to you guys. I just put it up on twitter. It's so stem. He'll come on. We'll look at the fucking mustache. That's the proof is real. This is a real fucking. Sorry man. This is so real. Christian guy came in through the five senses that we have is it's just not put together. You've got to go find and put all the parts together, but the world has, you know, how these feelings, the helmet Razah bar and help them hear me. It's fucking mustache.

Speaker 5:          23:49          To be a gay dude and be religious and to think that God hates you. You can always be afraid if you haven't seen that video, you got to watch it because it's completely ridiculous and by the way, totally real. You know the fucking dude is a, is a gay guy who converted to Christianity and he's like, you know, try to tell people the right way to go.

Speaker 2:          24:10          Wow.

Speaker 5:          24:15          It's pretty awesome. It's pretty awesome stuff. Where's your lighter? Yeah, put it up in the air, Bro. Well, as get lighter considered. Do we watch tim and Eric? Yeah, man.

Speaker 2:          24:26          Tim and Eric Rocks. That's probably top three favorite shows. Not In celebrity rehab.

Speaker 5:          24:32          That fucking thing. A dance floor. Dale, if you haven't seen that, go do a google search for dance floor. Dale is got to be one of the funniest fucking videos I've ever seen in my life. The weirdest, funniest things on the Internet ever. Dance floor, Dale, you gotta. See this gotTa, find it, find it. It's online, it's on my website. You can find it on Joe Rogan.net

Speaker 2:          24:53          season three of 10 minute Erica, because they keep having recurring sketches and they just get funnier and funnier the more the more developed.

Speaker 5:          25:01          Here's a good question for you. What does Damien Maia and his Jujitsu bring to the table that latest didn't? Versus Silva because Damien Maia is fighting Anderson Silva next month and Abu Dhabi next week. Dude, I have a dummy next week.

Speaker 2:          25:13          I think Damien Maia is a better guard. Poorer the Talus does talus would pull guard, but he wouldn't clench up first. So you know, filter doesn't. It's not going to just fall in. You got to really shoot deep with an under hook and you've got to make the guy sprawl and if he doesn't sprawl, you know, because you didn't take a deep shot, you're not going to pull them into your garden. David Maya likes to shoot deep and pull guard. I think that'll be the difference. There's no way he's going to stand with Anderson Silva, you know, just based on, not just based on Anderson Silva's career and what he's done, but based on his last fight where he tried to stand for a little bit with Nate Marquardt and he, he's going to pull guard immediately. Trust me. He's not going to fuck around anymore.

Speaker 5:          25:55          That shit. I hope that's true, but I didn't think he was going to try to stand with nate either.

Speaker 2:          25:59          Well, they stood with them for one punch and that was just one punch too long and he's not going to.

Speaker 5:          26:03          He's training with vandelay and vandelay brawler, you know, do you think that, uh, that style of getting in there and just mixing it up and get ugly, just not, it's not a good style for a guy who was not very technically proficient instruction, striking,

Speaker 2:          26:18          you know, he's just so good on the ground. Why give your opponent any kind of chance, especially Anderson Silva, what are you going to try and mix it up a little bit with them? That's a big fucking mistake. He's gonna. He's gonna. Pull guard immediately. Trust me or try to take them down because, you know, Anderson Silva isn't some NCAA national champion or anything, so I'm sure Damien Maia is really going to take a shot for real, for real, trying to take them down. But if he has any trouble he will pull guard. No problem. I guarantee that.

Speaker 1:          26:47          Yeah, we've definitely seen Anderson been taken down before it got taken down many times by um, uh, travis luder now Travis Luder probably had the most success. But you gotta think about that fight. Travis luder fought Anderson 11 weeks after Anderson had knee surgery on both knees, so that probably wasn't the best representation of his, his, his wrestling. Then Dan Henderson took them down as well and when Dan Henderson took him down because he wasn't able to do anything to let me just kind of like held them down on the ground, punched him a few times but really couldn't get anything going. No. So that's the big question is, is Anderson's Jujitsu good enough to stifle a Damien Maia? Because Damien Meyer had a hard time with Dan Miller and his last fight really couldn't get anything going with them. I mean he grounded, pounded him and you know, he'd beat them by decision but never came close to finishing with a submission. No, no. And I think Dan Miller is a real good, real tough guy, but I think Anderson's Jujitsu is at least as good as millers. I mean on paper at least he's a black belt

Speaker 2:          27:42          mothers of Rambo. But Miller has wrestled his whole life. There's a big difference. That's a different kind of animal when you're grappling with a real legit wrestler. And Anderson Silva has long limbs. I like going with guys that have long arms. It's hard. Rubber guards a lot easier with taller guys. It's harder for them to pull out of anything. I have long arms like the small one, 45 short five foot five, stocky wrestler types. That's hard to get any rubber guard on because they popped their arms out there, you know, out so easily. They're really small. So I think, uh, I think David Maya is going to have more success with his Jujitsu, with, with Anderson Silva. If he gets him to the ground then he did with Miller because Miller again, he's only a brown belt, but damn, he wrestled his whole life. That's, that's, that's a different kind of animal right there. A chimpanzee

Speaker 1:          28:35          think about Anderson is that Anderson has had elbow problems for years. He's said a bone chunks floating around his elbow that may training really difficult. He would have to ice his elbows after training. Sometimes it couldn't do any weight lifting and strength and conditioning because it's elbows hurt. He finally got all that shit fixed. You've got the elbow chunks, the piece of bone taken out. So we're going to see an Anderson Silva that's in a better condition than we've seen him in a long, long time. He's at a problem throwing his right hand because of it, which is really hard to believe when you see his fights. Big Country Nelson went tonight by fat mission. How dare you? Let me tell you something, man. Fat. A big guy like Roy Nelson, he that waits centralized in his stomach. He knows that a hold you with that shit that can keep you in a certain position.

Speaker 1:          29:21          He's really good at keeping his weight on you. We have a dude that we trained with Brent grandkids inside control. Man, that motherfucker is really hard to get off you and he's built similar to big country, not as fat, but he's got a big gut and you know, and he's talented as well. He's a good Jujitsu guy and when he gets on top of you and you know he gets a good position on you, is really hard to shake them off you. He plants that weight down on you and holds you in place and big country. If I had to guess what's gonna Happen Tonight? What's truth? You know, I would say that big contract he gets them down to ground is going to be a lot of trouble.

Speaker 2:          29:54          Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But struve has a lot of potential. He might be, he might be the underdog in this fight. He probably should be based on his experience and is really young and country's been grappling for a long time and he's really good on the ground. People haven't really seen that. He likes to stand in back, but country Nelson's really good on the ground. Really good. Really good.

Speaker 1:          30:15          Frank Mir, was it like 11? Nothing in a submission, man.

Speaker 2:          30:18          Yeah. He's really. He's got a great half guard game too. We just haven't really seen it. But true in the long run has so much potential. I mean that guy that's like, he's like 26, eight or something like that. He's super tall and he loves Jujitsu. You never see that. You never see tall guys like that who were athletic and coordinated. Love Jujitsu. I mean you've seen. We've seen 70 shell. He didn't like Jiu Jitsu. Um, I don't know what other tall guy, but you know, random ran a Kendall grove. That's another tall guy who likes to Jitsu, but he was true if he continues to evolve and, and remains a student of the game and everything, of course striking and wrestling as well. But in Jujitsu, the way he's moving and you know, we've talked several times about a Jujitsu and strategy and philosophies and stuff, and he's on the right track. He's that he, he, you know, I don't, I don't know if we can be country at this point in his career. Maybe, maybe not, but get that guy another five, six, seven years, if it continues to evolve, he can be a serious threat with that. Would that height his guard could be insane. Yeah. And he decided to be a Ninja office back. Fuck is only 22.

Speaker 1:          31:32          That's the other thing about that kid. He's real young. He's got a massive, massive amount of time ahead of him, you know, and a lot of potential. And he's got crazy heart. Remember in Germany when you got cut wide open. I was bleeding all over the place. And who did you fight that fight? He got in trouble and you got cut real bad and he still pulled it out and one of submitting the dudes. So it was uh, it was pretty bad ass. Do another youth stream tonight. Maybe. Maybe we will get back to the hotel, it'll be late here and I don't go to bed until late on the west coast, so it will be early for me. So yeah, we can do that. We could come after the after party and do it, do it. Non Sober, sober version of the dream because I got to go do the broadcast and right now go me or Ken Flo, who the fuck knows sun? That's why they got to do it. I think it's exciting having gotten me over here. I would have liked to see them over here years ago, but, you know, he's still young and he's got a lot to prove, you know, and I think uh, he's training real hard. He looked really in real good shape and he's saying all the right things that he wants to really make another run and get another run at Bj Penn and he's obviously got to get through Tennessee to do that. So I think going to be real interesting.

Speaker 5:          32:40          He's a solid wrestler and there's a big power puncher, you know, he hits hard. So, uh, I think Kenny's going to try to use his legs. He Kenny's got real good leg kicks, real good movement. He's going gonna try to use his footwork, working with leg kicks, and then if it goes to the ground, who tried to submit them and cut them up with elbows. The thing about Gomez Gomez has not fought anybody ever with the elbow rules. You know, elbows are different man, especially the cage, you know, cage and elbows, you know, those are two totally different things that he's never experienced before. So it's going to be going to be interesting. That'll be interesting. And Kenny, man, he gets better every time.

Speaker 1:          33:17          I gotta get Outta here guys. I gotta get ready to shower. You got to leave in 10 minutes. Thank you very much. I'll do this again. Come over my house and we'll do a full version. All. Alright. You want to leave with us? You know what? I'm going to just take my own car and got the rental. I'll see you in 10 minutes. No, 5:15. It's only four or five right now. Ladies and gentlemen. And then

Speaker 5:          33:48          finally were alone. So that's the story I got to leave in 10 minutes, so I should, I should uh, get my shit going. Yeah. I wanted to do just a little shell because I couldn't do one last week because I had a staph infection that I had to deal with so I didn't fucking die. That's the problem with Jujitsu, man. You know, you role with 30 motherfuckers and get weird skin shit, you know, we're diseases. I know a to got herpes on his head. What? Yeah, you can get a, you can get herpes from Jujitsu. Not Good. The deal with me getting a Sirius radio show, I'm going to do a weekly show. Uh, I think I'm going to do like a six week run, a trial run and it's all dependent on my scheduling because, uh, I just signed a deal to write a book.

Speaker 5:          34:35          I've been writing it for awhile but they've been negotiating a deal and we finally got the right deal. And um, I was in New York last week and I met with the publishers and they came out to see me when I performed at Gotham. So, uh, I got a nice deal and I'm getting ready and the deal is that I have to finish the book by August, so, uh, I'm going to be guns blazing trying to write this thing and finish it and most of the stories it's going to be mostly about my, uh, the beginning days of doing standup because I have so many crazy stories about bad road gigs and just struggling on the road and you know, what it's like to be an really an amateur comedian trying to, you know, go out there and get people to laugh for money and you know, and how fucking crazy it is and how unsure it is and how you really have no idea if it's ever going to work out and you feel, you know, it's a completely insecure.

Speaker 5:          35:27          You know, you feel like there's no way this is ever going to really turn out to be a career and how nutty some of the fucking gigs I've done. Well, why wasn't you at weigh yesterday? I don't even think I'm going to answer that just because it's so retardedly Britain. Uh, but if somebody else asks if I'll answer it two ways because I didn't get any time I got on my flight, didn't lend until 4:00, so they had Goldberg dual the weigh ins and then, uh, I had my show last night. Yeah, because we were in New York and then I flew back from New York Sunday. I had Monday to stay home with my family and then Tuesday flew out again. So unless I'd stayed here in Charlotte, there was no way really I was going to be able to get to the weigh ins. But no, I didn't.

Speaker 5:          36:13          I didn't really, uh, this as too much traveling. I need to be home at least a couple of days a week. Otherwise I go nutty when you have babies, man, who just can't wait to go home and see him, you know. Um, how's hardees? Hardees fine. Hardy didn't have any problems. There was nothing wrong with them. I can't believe it. Uh, you know, his shoulder, his arms, you know, uh, I think, uh, George St Pierre didn't quite have the arm bar. Right. But, uh, the Camorra there was one point in time, the more I thought it was just going to rip off. I mean it looked, it looked pretty bad. Bring back some chicks from the after party at least. No, I can't do that anymore. I made babies and I made it, made a wife and all that. All that shit. When I do want to show the zs Enzo Ferrari, I don't know him, but I think, yeah, I think he's on that show. The Kevin being sure that I'm doing this weekend, April foolishness. I think it's, it's either Friday or Saturday night, one of those. I'm not sure which I'll tell you right now. Salary.

Speaker 5:          37:26          Yeah. Saturday. Except the Gibson amphitheater and universal and I'm pretty sure it's way sold out. Those guys always sell out their shows. It's a really good line up to a lot, a lot of funny comedians. I did it last year with Patton Oswald. Did it. Raven Ray Romano. Patton Oswald. Jeff Ross. Uh, a bunch of good guys. I know Jeff's on it again this year. I think Jay Morris out again this year too. Is error. Yani, hot or what? She's hot, if you're not gay, if you're gay, she's probably not the buffer. Three 60 tonight. I think he said he would never do that again. I think he said the buffer three is going to retire and to put that shit in the books, it's over Sun. What do I think about crop circles? I think they're incredible geometric patterns when they're not humans made him. Who the fuck knows, you know, I mean, there's a lot of people that argue that it's impossible for people to make them that they've know three times the size of a football field and they appear overnight and they were in perfect geometric patterns and circles and everything.

Speaker 5:          38:27          I don't know know. I think it's very intriguing, you know, at the very least some of them are fascinating because there is so fucking huge, you know, and if really, I mean, if people really are making these things, you know, and uh, they're flattening them out and just leaving them there. It's like, wow, there's such incredible geometric art. You would think that they would want to take credit for that. You know, if it's just a hoax, it's incredible that it's a hoax that they've kept up for this long. Like how sneaky are they and what's the, what's the benefit of that? What's the, uh, what's the reward? I don't know. I mean, I don't have an opinion one way or the other though. I, um, I think it's also possible that it could be some sort of an experiment that they do to impose geometric patterns in these fields.

Speaker 5:          39:12          It might be something that they do, you know, from the sky or something like that. And who the fuck knows how they're doing it? If you talk to some people that say that these patterns, the way they're made, that the, uh, the, the nodes of these plants have been blown out. Like they've had energy pulse through them. Like microwaves, like expanded. I don't know. I don't know though. I really personally have not done enough research and really paid attention to both sides of the argument. I know one side of the argument is that it's bullshit. And the other side of the argument is that it's aliens. You know, on both of them seem pretty ridiculous, so I'm not, I'm not exactly sure what I think about that shit.

Speaker 5:          39:51          So what did I think about the Luke Stewart Andre Galvao fight? I thought that fight was really interesting. I was blown away by that. Luke Stewart Guy. That guy has incredible sweet man. He's relentless. I thought he won the fight. I thought he beat him with stand up and I thought his ground game and negated golf vowels, grand game and he swept him a bunch of times and I thought he asked him, you know, I thought it was a real close fight, but I thought a steward edge them. But man, he uh, he blew me away. Luke Stewart is a bad motherfucker and I'm really looking forward to his next fight. That was really, really impressive. UFC One 15. Cincinnati, they say that might be possible if um, if the, the um, Vancouver thing falls through. I don't know if that's fallen through or not A. I haven't heard it directly from the horse's mouth. So when I hear it I'll find out

Speaker 5:          40:46          anymore documentaries like the union coming out. Yeah, I did a documentary on Dmt, it's called DMT, the spirit molecule and it should be done in May and probably out for release sometime around the summer. I know they're taking it to film festivals and uh, that bring it all over the place, but it's a documentary mostly about different people's experiences on dmt. And I, uh, I'm the narrator. So that's the deal. Do I know who bob? Yeah. Bob was always that guy who claims to have worked for area 51 and you know, he's Kinda been discredited with a lot of things, especially like his education, I guess he kinda like told some lies about where he went to school and what degrees are in, but very, very intelligent guy and obviously knew a lot about that area, about area 51, whether or not he really did have any contact with you, fos or with alien spacecraft or any of that stuff.

Speaker 5:          41:43          I mean it could be total 100 percent or shit or it could be true. I mean, it's really hard to tell, but when a guy who lies about his education lies about certain aspects of his background, you kind of assume that he's probably lied about other things as well, you know, I don't know. I don't know. Again, I don't really have an opinion either way. Interesting to watch them talk though. He's very confident, you know, he's very confident which could mean either a who's crazy and that's why he's confident or be. He's telling the truth. I'm alright. I gotta get the Fuck Outta here because, uh, the car is picking me up in two minutes. I just wanted to, uh, to bust out a nice quick one right here for you guys and say what's up? So, um, thank you everybody for tuning in and we'll do one probably this weekend.

Speaker 5:          42:26          I'll have eddie come over to my house and we'll do like a full long ass one, maybe Friday. And that's it, my friends. Thank you very much. Enjoy the fights tonight. There are live on spike TV tonight. There's a, I don't know what time it comes on, but it's right before the ultimate fighter. So it's fight night Kenny Florian versus go me is the headline or it's going to be a sick, sick fight and Ross Pearson's on the car to, against dentists are looking forward to that too. All right, my friends, thank you very much for tuning into this thing again and uh, I will be back next week with a real, a solid podcast. Uh, and maybe we'll even do one this weekend with Eddie Bravo at my house. So thank you very much. And uh, I'll see you guys soon. Thanks.
