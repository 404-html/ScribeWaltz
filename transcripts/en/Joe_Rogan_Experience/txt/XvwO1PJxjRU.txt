A lot of people already took my Alpha brain. Eight one eight I need to hang around him while I used to be able to do a good Brody imitation, but it's gotten very generic. Now I've lost the tone. You know I still have Joe D as in my arsenal, but I've lost the Brody tone. I need to be around him. I need to see him. I need to feel him.

Save yourself some mother fucking money. Yeah. We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that is, oh and and I t on it is a website where you can buy shit that can make things better. What do I mean by that? What on it is, is what we call a human optimization website.

Speaker 2:          00:03:50       And what we sell is shit like Alpha brain, which does work. How to prove it. Show I took one, I took four, I take four. I'm fucking crazy. I'm accessive cause she got a brain. You got a big brain. I feel like, um, there's nothing in their toxic, I'm going to let this pitch right. What are you afraid of? Not Afraid of much, but I'm definitely not afraid to take it. For Alpha brains for a show, what is Alpha brain? Alpha brain is a nootropic and if you don't know what neutral, because I suggest you Google it. Google all the people that say the vitamins dealt worked. Goodall, Google, all the people that say nootropics do work vitamins, new tropics nutrition. There's so many contradicting opinions when it comes to um, uh, health and wellness. I am no expert. I have talked to a fuck load of experts though and we've been very fortunate to have some experts on the podcast exports like a doctor, Rhonda Patrick, uh, experts that actually understand nutrition.

Speaker 2:          00:04:45       So it's a very complicated thing and there's a lot of like, you'll real read on one website. This is going to kill you. And then another website, this is essential. One website says this prevents cancer. Um, believe in yourself. Logos being created right now while we're doing this at hot males, like what am I, yeah, it's the black hotmail. Anyway, uh, on it.com we sell 'em all sorts of various supplements as well as strength and conditioning equipment. All sorts of shit that you can use to benefit your life are our idea behind doing this show is what's the stuff that I use that I feel makes my life work better? Like what's the things that make my body work better? What's the things that make my mind work better? And Aubrey and I have a Servo. The similar idea about that. The similar, a similar opinion. You know, both of us are fascinated by, um, the latest trends and strength and conditioning. Both of us. This is distracting me. What does the tea, what are the people see right now? They see a logo. Yeah. Okay. That is not a fucking commercial jackass. You confusing. Fuck. That's the problem, right? You distract,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       distract me. There's just no way for me to do a logo at the same time. No, don't do it. Leave on it.com. Just leave this little thing scrolling it. Can you do all that shit off screen? Is that possible? Yeah. It's not that it has to. Oh Wow. Punched rock's going to have to wait. That's fine. I'm good with that.

Speaker 2:          00:06:16       On [inaudible] dot com go, go there. O, n, n I t used the Codeword Rogan save 10% off any and all supplements. Everything is explained. They're far better than I can explain to you. Um, but one thing I will say is that on it has a 100% 30 pill, 90 day money back guarantee on all the controversial shit like shroom tech sport or Alpha brain. Reason being is people are justifiably skeptical about things that claim to, uh, enhance cognitive function or things that claim to give you more endurance. He should be skeptical. There's a lot of bunk shit out there. Um, what we had on and have done is taken what we believe is the law, the best body of research that explains you supplements, put it up under research. And we've also done our own tests on our own tests on Alpha brain and ongoing other tests on the other various supplements that we have.

Speaker 2:          00:07:04       But all of them are backed by science and that science is all researched with references all uh, under the, the research tab, uh, whether it's for Alpha brain or for any of the other supplements, there's, if you don't think they work and you try him, just say this is bullshit and you get your money back. It's that simple. You don't even have to return the product. No one's trying to rip you off just trying to sell you shit that I use. Your body is made out of food and vitamins are in food and we've isolated certain, not we obviously not me, I'm retarded. But they have isolated certain things in vitamins that can enhance various, various parts of your life, whether it's your endurance or whether it's cognitive function. All of it. Again, explained that on it. O, n, n I t use the Codeword Rogan and save 10% off any and all supplements.

Speaker 1:          00:07:53       Oh, that's, wow. That's a website. It's an amazingly designed websites. Pretty Nice. Well, it's cool when you scroll down, it moves. Yeah. But what's really dope is that it's all made in house.

Speaker 2:          00:08:05       Ah, the, the honor people that work in the actual studio itself, Arby's put together this amazing crew of talented people. So yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:08:12       it's all like just very bad ass. Oh, it's like one of the best company websites. Our, they're, they're amazing. It's guys kick kickass. They're creative too. It's cool. Yeah, it's pretty cool. Yeah, it's really dope. Anyway, on a.com oh, went in our tea. That's it. Saps your bully. Is He? Hello? Chuck. Chuck. Chuck. Brian does know how to press play

Speaker 3:          00:08:36       the Joe Rogan. He fingered her job. Joe Rogan podcast by night. All Day.

Speaker 1:          00:08:46       We're full Sam Tripoli. Boom, back in the saddle. Powerful. Which Sam Tripoli and with a brand new comedy CD I brought one for. I know

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       some people don't even have CD players anymore, but uh, I bought it for you. This our work by my buddy and uh, and it's called, you can do this, it's called believe in yourself. It was either that, it's either that or I was going to call it shady shit, but I didn't think iTunes would let me put that up. So it's good. Yeah. Well kind of a, if you listen to the album, you get why I call it that. So it's like fun. Well I have no your materials. So I would agree with that. Like thematically sort of a, a fun, having fun with it. It just goes against the grain. It's the feedback that people have already listened to it really love it. And I'm, you know, I haven't put out a CD for a while. So I was like really excited to put this whole group of hour of power together.

Speaker 4:          00:09:40       And I did at the Edmonton comedy strip, which is one of my favorite clubs to play because it's literally the only club where I got off stage and two separate times the owners one, uh, Tammy one, Rick Bronson would pull me aside and literally go, dude, can you work dirtier? And I go, what? They go, we'd really like you to work dirtier. And I'm like, are you crazy? So ridiculous. So then I go up and say, I'm just getting filthy for the sake of getting filthy. And uh, but it's one of the grays clubs. And I said, you know, this would be great place to do CD. So I decided to do it. They're, they're maniacs up there and now they're at Minton's crazy. Well they're living in a place, you know, it gets 50 fucking below zero in the winter there and those are hardy folk and everyone's got cash cause they're fracking.

Speaker 4:          00:10:23       Oh yeah. They're all fracking up there. It's their unemployment is like 0.0001%. Like they're giving like 12 year olds shops because there's not enough people. None of people that go around for all the jobs. Well it's uh, it's interesting too because people that live in that kind of environment, if you could survive that kind of a winter and you stay job or no job, if you don't fucking plot and escape a year, you're a different kind of breed. Like yeah, it's blue collar with money, which is a dangerous situation. It's blue collar with money, but it's also people with like a certain level of character, like you have to, to get through the winter, you can't be too much of a fuck off. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like when Shit gets 50 below, you've got to be on your God Damn Toe. You gotta be on your game.

Speaker 4:          00:11:09       Like if you are a real case, fuck up. The kind of guy who like winds up falling asleep and parking lots all the time and you have security guard finds you at 9:00 AM you die. That chick that happened to some, I dunno where it was, somewhere in the northeast, she passed out on her doorstep and then she woke up and like half her body had all frostbites and they were going to have to amputate shit because she had passed out on her who just walked and somebody had walked by going, I think that girl is dead. Nobody says anything. She was only 19 also. She was like, oh, it's awful. It's blues man. Especially when you're 19 when you're 19 you don't fucking, you know, you don't know how to drink yet. You could go way too deep. Like she was probably, forget the frostbite.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       She's probably on death's door. Yeah. So how, how fucked up is her body and she's hot too. How fucked up. Scroll up. What does it say? What's the story? Hey, this isn't as good as may lose limbs. Oh God. Damn. It's her hands were three times the size, but their skin split from palm to finger. Oh my God. They spent the night playing drinking games with friends during which he lost several rounds to check off, like down at least 10 Tequila shots tweeted earlier that day to kill shots tonight. Yup. All my God. That's awful. Joe, do you remember a guy named Fast Eddie that use hang out at the comedy store? The Fat Mexican. He was called fast that he's there all the time. He was there for his birthday one time. Was he a comedian? No, he's just one of the guys that really nice due to hangs out.

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       He's saying out the patio. I know him. You hear them start to hang out there forever. Okay. I probably know him that for ever. And uh, it was his birthday and everyone was buying them shots and we're driving around and I mean he is gone. I mean, he is God, he's like dropped me off at the club. You know, it's the guys who were like, yeah, we'll drop you off. You know, we will just throw you out of the car and you might die in a dumpster. But, but if it's a chick, nobody lets that happen. Everyone's like, no, you come on, you too drunk. That's not true. Depending on what kind of chicken is, if it's a giant mouthy chick collects to fight, dudes will kick that bitch out of the car and hit the gas. Get your ass kicked. Yeah. I mean only bad people would kick anyone out of the car in the fucking winter.

Speaker 1:          00:13:27       Oh, you have to be a really bad person and you're like, okay, good luck. Or that guy's a total piece of shit. He some loud mouth dude wants to fight cops, you know, driving by in a rolled on, we fuck you pig. Like put the fucking window down dude, what are you doing? We were driving and I just heard my window down and go, what's up? And he's like, whew. And he just hold down the side of my window, which is nice. They got outside the car and didn't just fill up my backseat with Mexican vomit. You ever hung out with a dude who doesn't have it? The whole lot of friends, but he seems like a cool guy and you're like, man, this guy's pretty cool. You know when or why did nobody's hanging around with this guy? Come hang out with us and then the dude gets drug.

Speaker 1:          00:14:07       It just becomes a maniac. Fuck you to the bouncers and fucking, I mean there are dudes like that that gets this. Jekyll and Hyde just get, oh, I used to be way back in the day you used to be used to be, do know you were Jacqueline Hyde because I knew I would just get drunk and I was just like, but did you feel big? You becoming Jacqueline Hyde? Yeah, but you would do it again. You don't really know. That's why I don't really drink that much. I don't even drink at all. Actually back then when you would do it, you would like, okay, here comes taking my medicine. I used to warn people. Sometimes I get a little crazy. I been around. You are drunk, dude. I'm, I'm gonna be honest with you. I don't, I don't think you're a Jekyll and Hyde Guy lion now. Well No, no, no.

Speaker 1:          00:14:53       I've been around you and you're drunk and you were younger. However I fucking doing you at least 10 years. Probably like 13 I got picked up at the comedy store and just be around 2000 so during that time we have all seen each other in completely in a, in a state of, if somebody wanted to have sex with us, it would technically be raped. Yeah, that'd be raping us. We've, we've all been in that state seeing each other that can't rape the willing. Right. But you can according to, there's like a lot of people that are actually arguing this and they have to see you can rape guys. Yes. There have to say it about guys when they're saying you about women if you want, there's obviously they recognize that there's a real issue with that when it comes to like being contradictory and being hypocritical.

Speaker 1:          00:15:36       If you start saying that if a man has sex with a woman who's had a few drinks, that's rape where you have to also conversely say that if a woman has sex with a man, has had a few drinks, that's rape and if you're both drunk, you're raping the shit out of each other. That is the weird thing, dude, is that it's a double illegal act. So yeah, technically she did rape pim, but I mean is it not the same face on technical at all? It's not a tactical at all because she didn't write them. She had sex with a drunk guy and we all know what that is and we have to add all these goddamn extra layers. It doesn't change the actual act of what it is. The real problem with defining all these things is this is rape and that is rape and this is privilege and that is, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       It's, those are all just labels. You're putting labels on things that we know exactly what they are. Okay. If a school teacher blows a 14 year old, it's not rape. I totally agree with you on that one, but here's the thing. If she's gross, it's an issue. It's not at all, and we all know that to be a fact. We all know that. If a chick who looks like Tara, Patrick winds up blowing some 17 year old kid, that's not a goddamn crime. I mean, yeah, it's going to fuck that kid's head up, but it's not a god damn. Not in a bad way though. What Dude's like? Oh my God, Tara, Patrick's suck my dick. How has it been raped by high fiving people? How was it rape? No, I agree with you on that one, but not live in the country where it's like you can't technically have different laws for different people, right?

Speaker 1:          00:17:04       We have to apply these laws to everybody. I agree with everything you're saying. It's good though. It's good that people would that hypocritical because it exposes it when the end is subject like this, which becomes so preposterous when you start talking about it exposes how crazy it is. There are people, men and women like to get drunk and fuck. If you engage them in that activity, you don't automatically become a rapist. Yeah. But there is a level that you get to that gets rapey. Yeah, there is. And we all know this. Yes. Label it all you want. We all know there's something wrong if someone's really fucked up and blacked out and you say fuck it and you have sex with them anyway. That's crazy. That's fucked up. There's also women, there's also women that you've met that her so conniving that could probably rate like,

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       like, Hey, I want to have a Joe Rogan baby, you know, and like gets you drunk to the point where you fuck them and comment on Condo. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:17:57       It's totally possible. But again, you, there's had to take a condom, they have to grab the condom, take it, put it in the toilet and flush it because these women will take that card and squirt that bait and it's this x and the thought of just having a baby for the, for the sake of making money. The fact that that's acceptable or not

Speaker 2:          00:18:20       just that it is definitely that. But I think there's also a part of it is having a baby with a guy who ordinarily doesn't want anything more than sex from you. Yeah. Now you connect with them, you know, so there's, there's those options. There's someone who just wants a baby, you know, there's some people that just want a baby and this girls had just like, God damn it, I want a baby. I'm going to give a fuck if this guy wants a baby or not. I want a baby. You know, obviously not supposed to do that. You should probably like tell the guy, like you could probably find a guy who's willing to just give you a baby.

Speaker 4:          00:18:49       But then it comes back and then there's all that legal stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:18:53       Well, there was legal stuff with a guy who, uh, got he got, he was a sperm donor. He gave sperm to these people. They had a kid and then the, he got sued for a child support and he lost because his DNA made the child, I mean, this poor guy, he wasn't involved in the raising of this kid at all.

Speaker 4:          00:19:14       That's incredible. This new thing with the guy from Los Boys Up, lost sellers, Patrick, the movie, what's his name? Pat. He was like the lead vampire. He, uh, his ex wife, he had, they had donated sperm or some shit like that and she took in, had a kid and then he, he was trying to get custody or at least get visitation rights and he finally got, got the right by the judge because he is the father. But it's like that's some crazy shit that you could donate sperm and then it, then it comes all this crazy issues with it. How's that? Even society's just crazy. Jason. Patrick. Yeah. Patrick. Right. What I say? Uh, we all think we remembered his name. Yeah. The lead to God about that dude. Yeah. He like, he was really big and the, I think he did like speed too, and then it just went off

Speaker 2:          00:19:57       the rails. He, um, is uh, John John Machado student. I've seen him hanging around with John Job before it takes Jujitsu. I love that name. John Chalk. You can't work at Burger King with a name Sean Joke. You could, yeah. I'm John Jock. Jason Patch closer to be reunited with Sun. Okay, let's let me read this. I'll get sad. He's a sperm donor and now he's got a kid.

Speaker 4:          00:20:17       Well he was married to this woman I believe, and she took his sperm and had a child and now he wants the beans.

Speaker 2:          00:20:25       Kids' life. Oh boy. Bar. Bar Bar.

Speaker 5:          00:20:28       That's why even when you get into massage parlors, they tied the condom in a night and throw it in the frigerator. I think it's sell that shit. They don't throw it away. And they take the condom out of that room.

Speaker 4:          00:20:36       Yeah. They don't want your loads. Do they nuke your lows? I throw them in the microwave and then make Godzilla mother load is out there talking about that's his gold and then their condoms and like we'd find a mate. Got It. Boas. How smooth sailing from here. What do I got here? Calling their friends up to you to do. Do, do, do. Oh, what's up Matt? Too little. I got here. I tell you what I got. I got a little rubber baggies of goals. This is our ticket out of here. I got red band come by and calm down Twitter. He got a hundred town Jean come. He's gonna want it back. Rubber band, man. It's a little more talent than I think people give him credit for. I got to work with recently and I feel like a, I never really, I mean it was just fun hanging out with them and they think he's a little more time looking at him because I don't say while you're looking at him, that's his weird. I am weird though. You are weird. I'll give you that. I'll give it back. I'm a weird dude. I'm a little crazy, but I got a new CD out. Believe in yourself by it. Is it on iTunes? Awesome. Yes, and it's on all things. records.com Brian, we talked about this before, but

Speaker 1:          00:21:50       why don't you put together like a set and do like a CD or something digital release? I need to do. They just need to do more stage time first though. Yeah. Do, yeah. Do comedy is that Shit. I can't, I can't get spots anywhere in La.

Speaker 4:          00:22:03       Um, you can, you just put together your own shows. Do dual those fucking small idea. I can tell you where you can go. You can go to the John Lovitz, you can go to this new club out on Hollywood boulevard. There's a bunch of place you can go. I mean if he can't get the store and you can't do the, I don't know why the Improv doesn't put you up. Yeah. Probably someone doesn't like your sexiness. That's right. I do believe

Speaker 1:          00:22:26       your man, he makes people very, very intimidated. You can get spots though, dude. You can get spots. You just got to hustle. You got to hustle and do it is, you know, that's the issue. You've got to decide what do you like doing, like doing a million other podcasts or do you want to do like two or three your podcasts, podcasts a lot lately and be smart. It's focusing on the comedy thing, which is so tiring. Cause as you know, like going on the road and finding a spot yourself doing it. The Doug Stanhope Way getting like a rock club and getting the door and doing all it is the most stressful thing ever. That's why managers, I get that 10 or 20% that they take because that shit is just annoying as fuck. It's just hard though. It's stressful. And Harvey, I just went to Vegas and it was such a, it was so fun.

Speaker 1:          00:23:10       That place was amazing. But there this the headache around booking it and getting everything. You could get somebody, dude, you can get somebody to book you. It's worth it. And they can put you in places where you ordinarily might not have a connection with a guy. And have you tried to get a booking agent? No, I don't even know what to do. Well you should get one like other comics are doing it and you're friends with a lot of comics. You know, it's not hard to do. But once, once you like start doing it on a weekly basis and really hammered and then the act like starts to take shape.

Speaker 4:          00:23:39       I've doesn't blessed man lately. I've been touring a lot and it's totally fun when you just keep going. When you get to work on a joke and over and over again and then all of a sudden you just riff on a new punchline now just boom, boom, boom and it just builds and you know, cause I'm trying to now write a new hour to do an the finally shoot something I've never shot in our special. So you want to ride an hour additional to that and then shoot it and how much time? Well I'm debating whether I do like, cause I have another CD called crime fighter and that material's really old but do the best of this and this best of this new stuff I'm doing and then shoot an hour or just do a whole new hour.

Speaker 2:          00:24:16       They do a whole new hour because that way people could still find this stuff and they could still tuned to the old stuff. Yeah. I'm, I'm a about 35 minutes into a new hour. I made a mistake once of not doing a totally new set because my, my set, like I had certain jokes that were just better, which in my showtime special and then when I did my CD on comedy central, there was a couple of bits that I don't know how many bits, but there was more than one that crossed over. That was just a better bit now. And I've just stuck to the in any way cause I was like, not too many people saw the Netflix one because Netflix in 2005 was in its infancy. It was a completely different thing. But uh, I regret that now. I probably shouldn't have done that. I probably should have just done totally new, but I had better versions of those bits. I'm like, God damn it. These are so much better.

Speaker 4:          00:24:58       I saw your new special, it was on youtube and yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:25:01       it's hard. He, yeah, people take it and they stick it online. You know, you can, I don't really try to take it down.

Speaker 4:          00:25:07       I uh, down a couple of times. I feel like there's a bunch of bits on there that I hadn't heard before. Did you do new stuff in that special? Yeah, some of the brave as shit right there. Putting out new bits on the, and especially I guess, well one of the things about

Speaker 2:          00:25:22       doing a podcast is you're, even if you're not writing during the time that you're doing the podcast, you're thinking about shit it a way and you're going over like, especially if we're like doing a podcast like this, like hanging out with comics, just talking shit. It's not like someone who's promoting a very specific book or you know about a very specific subject, which is fascinating as well, but doing these kind of podcasts like you're forced to think for long periods of time and you get ideas and I think it's easier to write. I think it's easy to write shit. I think there's a bunch of different ways to write, but I think that just talking as a is a way to write too well, you know what is, what does writing, it's just coming up with an idea, having a creative idea. You get a lot of those just talking, you know they're not, it's not the only thing. You know that you also get a lot of them doing stand up. You get a lot of them writing stand up and you get a lot of them writing other shit. You might write an email to somebody and have a fucking great idea in the middle of just trying to be silly in an email and you're like, Holy Shit, that's a bit, and then take it and copy and paste it. It's a bitch. Just a matter of just being in motion all the time.

Speaker 4:          00:26:27       View. Right. If let's say you write 10 beds, how many do you think actually make the act if out of worth it? Yeah. There's a few that are just like, what was that? Go back over the notes and you're like, the fuck was I thinking, man. I tried to take everything that happens

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       and tries to turn it in. I tried to turn into a bit and then sometimes you're like, this is going to kill and you go out there and it just flat lines. But I also get Bambi legs when I'm doing new material, when I have material, I know that kills. I just, you know, I'm like for throwing like fucking hammers of the God and then I get up there and I do this new bit and I, it just like, I get the Bambi legs where my legs start shaking and I thought I started dropping f bombs. I like every other word is a fuck. Fuck, fuck. You can't let that happen. See, you know what happens, right? You know that that happens and you talk about it, but you, you let it happen. You can never let that happen and try not to never let it happen.

Speaker 1:          00:27:21       You just never let it happen. It's not going to happen. It's just you could feel the energy of just go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But when guys do that, like you'll see guys like on the road, especially if you bring guys in the row that has been on the road before and you see like the first time they go on stage and you know, fucking Fort Lauderdale or something like that. That's so funny. Yeah, that's happened to me. And a joke doesn't go over well in the, in the, the fuck's to start flying out. And what it is is like they're saying, ah Yup. They're like, it's a, the guy, a fucking guy with the fucking thing and the audience does not want to hear that. A poor use of words. You see that at the Hollywood improv a lot because a lot of people think that's like the office.

Speaker 1:          00:28:01       That's where you go to work when the industry is going to be there. And when you're young comic and it's the first time he gets set there, a lot of them put like this humongous amount of pressure on themselves to do well there. And I've always felt like as you move up to comedy chain, I feel the gigs kind of get easier. You know, you, you know the DA, the ticket price goes up and as a ticket price goes up. I always feel like people want to laugh. They're like, I'm dropping 50 bucks on this ticket. I'm going to laugh. You know, I want to laugh. So, so people, at least I couldn't disagree more real. Yeah. Why would I don't understand why anybody would be more inclined to laugh cause they paid a lot. They would love, they want to have a good time.

Speaker 1:          00:28:42       Like if you're paying $50 compared to going to show where it's like free comedy. Okay. That's the difference. Because I think that people who go free comedy, they could've done anything else. They're not really there for comedy. Right. Someone pays for comedy, even if it's 10 bucks, you know, whatever it is. If they're paying for comedy, they're going there to see a show. Right. But there's a, there's a big difference between that and like we paid 50 bucks. We're going to laugh hard. Right? I mean I think it's the opposite really. Yes. When the ticket prices get high, people do a little bit of this like how much should I have to fucking pay? There's guys out there that charge 150 bucks a ticket. I've seen those $50 a ticket. You know there's like they have tiered seating, like the seating in the front, it's like 200 bucks seating behind that is 150 and you see people in that audience like this.

Speaker 1:          00:29:24       I was just in Pachangas Brian Regan's playing there and I think it's like a, he's like $110 but some of it's up there. Oh Shit. I pay that to see him. He's hilarious I think is great. You know we talked about that on the podcast before, but apparently we were incorrect when was about Jay Leno, so we should probably correct. It's a good opportunity. The uh, when you see the super high tickets, those are actually scalpers. That's like ticket hub and shit like that. But this was an advertisement on, yeah, tango. I understand. But we were talking about Jay left and we were quoting like $250 tickets and shit like that. Apparently his tickets are not that expensive. It's just that, uh, you know, scalpers. They exist. I've been doing his spots on Sunday nights at the comedy Magic Club. Oh, he's not doing it anymore. Well, he's on the road a lot, so I do some of those some of the times and he's not there.

Speaker 1:          00:30:13       I'd do a spots. That's great. I think you'll be in there as great because it allows it to a kind of shift the comedy a little bit when they were talking about the differences in the crowds between my crowds and Jay Leno's crowds. It's pretty hilarious. I think it's great, man. Well, it's, it's a good spot, man. I mean it's in the place has been there for a long time, but now chow and I'm there. Dude, you owe the food. I chowed down. That's a good club, man. I mean, it's a club that's owned by a guy who really has a love of comedy. He's a great place. He, I think he started that club. I think he bought it in 1978 I don't know if he started it or if he was the first. I think he was the first, but either way it's like a goddamn museums.

Speaker 1:          00:30:52       I'm blown that stinky shit in the air. That's stuff's gross. Slide love stinky man. It's like, it's like spraying perfume in the air at Abercrombie and Fitch, which fucking gross. It smells bad. You don't do those cigarettes. I don't want to smell it. It's fucking gross band. Stop it some. I saw some guy doing that at a restaurant the other day and it was like it filled the room with this stinky smoke or they're starting to band. But I mean you could see it all over the place and people are looking around like, is that smoke? Like what is technically what the fuck is going on? If I have to breathe your shit, we're in a gray area. Yeah, but it's not illegal. It's not legal and people are still doing restaurants and then nobody, it's like if you lit up a cigar in a restaurant, people go nuts.

Speaker 1:          00:31:35       They would fucking beat your ass. Somebody would kick you out. But this guy pulled one of these things out and start puffing it in, in a restaurant, and nobody did anything. It was like this weird state of mind, like, are we breathing it and smell it? Smells it had like a strawberry smell to it or something icky. Yeah. It isn't smoke though. It's vapor, but I don't believe that. And it smells just vape shit to him. If it's just vapor. Okay. You tell me this. What's the difference between you and hailing that vapor and me and hailing that vapor. It's going into your body and you're blowing it out. So inside when you're doing that, it's transporting the t the nicotine. So when it goes out into the air, isn't it also transporting at least some of the nicotine? Uh, it has to be. It is.

Speaker 1:          00:32:18       It's so small and it's nicotine. It doesn't matter if you're forced to that, but what? You can't say that because you're, you're asking other people to in the, in gesture nicotine. That's the whole purpose of making secondhand smoke illegal. I think it's so smart that it will, you won't even feel any, shouldn't be anything. It should be zero, should be zero amount of drugs that you could put in the air that affect other people. That's not something we have to deal with. We don't do that as a, let me guess. We do. I was going to say we don't do it with our bodies, but I guess some checks give off a fuck the purchase volume or like when you're in a mall and you go buy a can like a Yankee that's way worse. Not like perfume. It's not like perfume. You're actually breathing in.

Speaker 1:          00:32:55       I see it in the air. It's like when you blow that thing out, I can see it. It's a fog machine. I don't believe that. I don't believe that. I think there's some of them that are, but I think some of them, man, that shit lingers. Like smoke. Like there's some that you see it like the plot. It blows out and within seconds it's gone. It just disappears. But there's other ones that float around in the air and that's the thing they're saying about these e-cigarettes. They're saying, look, they're absolutely better for you than regular cigarettes. Cigarettes, health experts are saying this. But what they're not saying is all e-cigarettes are equal. And what they're not saying is that all cigarettes that are, you know, using these little electronic mechanisms have the same mechanism that they act in the same way. So when you see what looks like fucking smoke, you're seeing a guy who burned some tobacco oil.

Speaker 1:          00:33:43       Yup. I mean that's what it is. It might not be plant matter. It might be just the oil, but I feel like it's smoke. There's no regulated standards that everybody must have the same thing. Yeah. I'm not sure enough to really discuss the wild west, but what I've understood by listening to people talk about it, this is the standards are very different. Like, like you can get like one, like a blue e-cigarette. Like if somebody had a blue in this room, there's smoking in. I'm pretty sure that is just vapor. Like that's all you're getting. You're inhaling this thing and you're puffing out just vapor, but when you buy one of those fucking fire hydrant looking bitch, it's like Rosanne has those light sabers with a two bucks thing. One of those flute things that, what are those things called? Those like a flute w when you suck on the end of it, what would the the mouthpiece called?

Speaker 1:          00:34:28       Fluke. Oh yeah. Fluke. Now that's a fish. This thing, a fluke. F L. U. K E is a fish. Oh, well maybe it's a fluke in it. That's she had a mouth. I thought it was, this could be, look it up. All right. Here. I thought it was a flute wasn't a flew f l u e flute. That that was a fluke. But isn't that a part of like a musical instrument? Yeah, I fell you e. Yeah, and I think that's what it, that's why the call, same thing because it's like, well that's why we googled times. That little thing you put in like a, that little thing would be to put on the end of a wooden instrument. It's also hot dog joint. You're read it flew keys, the many different words of the English language. Um, well, okay. The flying, the Flying Fluke, um, the part of an anchor that catches the ground, especially in the triangular piece at the end of an, of the end of each arm. Hmm. Under anchor a Barb or a barbed head of a harpoon, a spear Arrow or the like, and either half of the triangular

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       tale of a whale. Okay. There's another, um, there's an accidental, like there's a fluke, like it was a fluke victory. That's one that was a fluke or an accident or chance happening. Uh, an accidental accidentally successful stroke such as in billiards. It's a fluke shot and billiards. They say, uh, obscure origin. Okay. Fluke. Like a guess. All right. Any of several flute. Perry, no. American flounders. I used to catch those when we lived in Massachusetts. Just catch a summer. Flounders they're called flukes and uh, any of a variety of other flatfishes no, it doesn't say that. Now let's look up flu. Flou he, cause I think that's what we're thinking of. Oh, I might be wrong about that too. Flu is a passage or duct for smoke booth chimney. So it's a flu. It's not a fluke. You fuck heads ruined the whole thing. And he ducked our passage for air gas or the like.

Speaker 2:          00:36:39       So it has to be that, you know what I've found man, you know, uh, those uh, you know, green mountain grills, they make those pellet grills, they make appellate, not green mountain grills, but other companies, they make pellet smokers really well. You can do like, you know, you go to the barbecue, like I've been looking up the smokers man, you know, because I did that smokey thing with the ham. My smokers kind of wack. It fell over in the wind, the wind knocked it over and it's all fucked up now I'm like, hmm. I mean it worked fine for the mom, but it was kind of a pain that Dick like you had to get up every couple hours and stick a wood chips in it. I thought it would be more self contained in that, but they have these things like green mountain grills or you know the green mountain grows a pellet smoker or its appellate cooker. Um, but they have pellet smokers to that work like in a kind of a different way. It's more smoke than it is just the heat from burning the pellets I guess. But you could make ribs and shit on them.

Speaker 5:          00:37:31       Yeah. When, when Joey Diaz says that he got the meat sweats because I got it the other day from eating meat for eating meat ribs. Uh, what is that from? Because I mean it was serious. Like I thought it was having a heart attack after eating cause I was, I was getting hot and then shaky and then

Speaker 2:          00:37:46       your body's just trying to burn off all that extra flesh. He just stuffed on your law. I mean that's what it is. Your body's just going, Holy Shit. We aid a Fogo de Chao eddies match with boiler and we were sweating like crazy. Just dig in when you eat a lot of meat.

Speaker 5:          00:38:02       I love it. I take one of those things where I'm driving by the hospital in Burbank and I'm like, should I just like pull over and just wait and wait this out to make sure I don't need to be there soon. We thinking you were dying. It felt something was not right, man. I, I felt like I was something was up.

Speaker 2:          00:38:18       Are you worried about your health? Is that why you go into the electronic cigarettes? You just doing this because you were in the studio?

Speaker 5:          00:38:23       No, I I I mostly do electronic cigarette cause the girl, she'd only do it. The girl I'm with hates it so much. So I have good, good for her. Good. What does she hate more your cigarettes or your a hand job places.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       I know. Shh. Jesus. Sam, you are spell it out. No denial. You fucking cock blocker.

Speaker 4:          00:38:45       Yeah. Well let me have Sam said the robot. Hey listen,

Speaker 1:          00:38:53       uh, Sam Shabbily knows what you do. He always does that shit man. There's been so many times for Sam has said something where I'm like, you're fucking, what are you shooting?

Speaker 4:          00:39:01       Like trip out maps. What are you talking about? Interesting guy. You'll get mad at me all the time for just bringing up something you talk about onstage. He's got a big, like everybody mad at me on Twitter because it's something that I just literally just was like, Hey, did you see write back and say this? And then at the firestorm breaks out. Not think she's on Twitter. She's like a social media person. It's so weird. I know. I'm out of shape. No Way. Because I was running one day in La Jolla. People randomly started cheering me on as I was running down the street. Guys on bikes were giving me high fives and thumbs up. I was like, dude, I'm just running. This isn't like a fucking marathon. Yes. You

Speaker 1:          00:39:50       know that they didn't see you perform at the comedy store there. That's right next to La Jolla. Or maybe it was so funny seeing your boobs that they were like, yeah, how honey, you know hog called. Why would you assume? Why wouldn't you assume that they knew who you were? You were performing in that fucking town. How many people do you think are in La Jolla? I know, but it was in PB. I know it's the same basic place, but nobody knows for. How long ago was this? This was like a couple of weeks ago. Sam Tripoli. You're internet famous in a way, you know that, right? Do you have a fucking CD? That's number 11 on it. Believe in yourself. Yeah, but I mean seriously stop and think about that. What are you confused that people would like give you the thumbs up if they think you're funny? Yeah, I do, but I just feel it himself down.

Speaker 1:          00:40:30       Sam triply. Yes. I'm the, I'm the, I'm the house of self doubt. That's where I come from. Yes, I do have self doubt, but I really had to think it more has to do with me looking like I'm barely holding on as I run. Well there's a little of that, but I'm trying to give you a fucking half, half glass full option and you're not even willing to take it at some defeatist type thinking. Sam, I don't know why. I just have a feeling as more to do with the running kind of rocking cause you're trying to work in your material about running and people getting true at all. Working in a bed. Come on. Okay. There's a bit of a bear. A little bit of a little, a bit of a something there. I know I can ramble with Pacific beach. It's fucking beautiful isn't it? It's gorgeous. I don't know why. I like, why would you live in Cleveland when you could live in PB? People get stuck. They don't have enough money to move in the hairy scary to try to relocate to a new spot. I would smoke a ton of crack that way I wouldn't have to eat for like two weeks and I just save all my money for a great crack grows on trees. A gray, I

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       mean give it a crack bullish on the corner. I mean cracked. He grown trees. It'll put crack dealers at a business but everybody be on crack. Everybody would be imagine if that was like a real issue. Like crack was just growing everywhere. A lot of people in trees. There'll be a lot of people that are dead.

Speaker 4:          00:41:48       This is a joke on my CD. I was walking my dog next door. I've crackheads everywhere. I was walking my dog, I looked in the trees, there were crack heads in the trees. That's a true story. They were hanging up out there and there's like five Prac gets in these trees.

Speaker 2:          00:42:03       That's, you know, you got good crack. It's like if you go buy a pasture and you see big fat, healthy cows, that's some good grass. Those, those cows are eating good. But if you, uh, if you see a crack head up in a tree, did you see the one nearby has some really good,

Speaker 4:          00:42:17       do you see the video of the, the jazz band playing jazz and the cows just all walk up and start listening to the band jam. Really? Yeah. And it was like the co they have to pull over and take a piss and guys starts playing his thing and all the cows, you start looking and then you see them walk over and they start listening to the band.

Speaker 2:          00:42:34       That's so cool. Cows than people. I'm such a fascinating relationship, man. That's a weird thing. Yeah. We eat them. We'll need, we don't just eat them like very, very, very, very, very, very few people have them as pets, you know, and the people that do have them as pets, they usually get something out of them like milk. Yeah, welcome. And then the big male ones, boy, not really interested in being your friend. You've got to keep them in the fuck away from people. You got to cut their balls off at an early age and those are the ones you cook. Yup. You make your, your dairy. I've won a fucking weird relationship that these animals have somehow or another like sort of developed and been groomed to develop to be these docile giants that we just pick meat from. So strange. I mean we've accepted it because it's normal. But if, if human beings, the, if the concept of eating other animals didn't exist and then, you know, we started introducing the idea, we found a better way to get our protein then beans. In fact, if you eat animals, animal protein is high in omega three fatty acids. And we started extolling the virtues of murdering cows and Edm

Speaker 4:          00:43:45       people will be like, what the fuck are you talking? What are you crazy man? Eat animals flipped the fuck you going to eat him.

Speaker 2:          00:43:51       But because we eat animals all the time, it's just no big deal. They acceptables totally murders fine. Well and we just have this thing. Well you know animals eat animals and fucking they would eat us, which is totally true. Yes they would. But it's weird. What I'm getting at is it's weird and it goes back to what we were talking about about living in Edmonton, cause it's weird what people just get used to. It's weird that people get used to 50 below zero. It's weird that people get used to plowing themselves out of the driveway everyday because it snowed a foot and a half over night while they were asleep. And so they have to get up two hours early just so they can get out of their fucking driveway and drive down that slippery road to a job. That sucks. But people do it. They just fucking do it.

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       They just accept it, they accept it, and she's like, this is my reality. Cold as fuck. Even prison. That's where it gets really weird, man. People except their prison reality. That's why they say that men become institutionalized. Like I guess women as well. Probably right. If they're locked up for a long time, they become used to the community and the, uh, the, the social schedule schedule, they get used to that world. And when I say the community, I don't see it. It's like, it's fucking great community. Great NBC show. No, I don't mean that either. What I meant was that it's like they get used to that sort of structure. That's social structure. They get used to that world and they're scared and when they get, they get free, they'll commit like some stupid little crime to get locked up. Nobody gets hurt so they get sent back.

Speaker 1:          00:45:13       Yeah. That definitely does happen. There's a guy of the option, I think stay in. Look, I think if someone's gotten you to the point where you're so fucked up, you want to stay in prison and you don't want to be free, or if you are so fucked up and you have the, the ability to recognize it, you know, like if you're a child molester or something along those lines, which you know, take away from the horrific act of what molesting a child is fucking unbelievably evil, disgusting, disgusting and evil. But imagine, I don't understand like some people's motivations for things. I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm not inside their head. I could speculate, but I really couldn't imagine what it's like to be a child molester. Somewhat. Obviously can, could you imagine being a person who does not want that in them? It does not want that, that whatever the fuck it is that, that, that aberration, that fuck up, that horrible left turn in their mind that makes them want to molests kids.

Speaker 1:          00:46:10       But it's there. And so, you know what? If one of them was like, you know what, man, don't let me out just to leave me in here. I think in here I'm having a good life or they're good enough life. There was a story about a guy who infected women with HIV and he, he had infected a bunch of them because he said, because he didn't believe he had it. He thought it was bs and he's just him. Tommy Morrison. Toni Morrison was saying that. Remember, but he went to jail and this guy, they wouldn't let him out. They kept him in jail for longer till they figured out what they were going to do with them. What can you do? How can you stop someone from giving a disease and how can you, you know, just you have it, dude. You got it. You can't give it to other people.

Speaker 1:          00:46:48       Yeah. I mean people have been giving people the clap from the beginning of time. Right. You know, I mean, how many fucking people have chlamydia? No, they have chlamydia and still go out and fuck, that's gotta be rough. It was rough. But then they would do it with aids to man. People do with everything. There's obviously they, you know, obviously people do give it up because it gets spread around. Right. Well how about this fucking magic Johnson Donald Sterling thing, this, this whole thing like a part of his whole thing that a lot of people are ignoring was her and the guide sterling and her having this conversation where he was saying, you can go fuck these guys. He was like, I don't care what you do with them. Fuck 'em go out. You know, fuck them. Like you're,

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       you're hanging out magic. Wait a minute, hold on. Well, he even said that he, I said that in the Anderson Cooper interview that this guy was going around having sex with people when he knew had HIV. Yeah. He said that in the Anderson Cooper thing and I'd heard that before. We'd probably does. But what's crazy is that it's just like everything else. It's just like having plumbing Ia. It's just like having herpes. It's just like, like people don't think of HIV, which can be potentially fatal. I mean, I guess less fatal now that they have a lot more drugs. I think eventually it's just going to be like diabetes almost, but you can give it to somebody. I think that's where it got an hourly thing. Drugs for it forever. They ever kind of wore it. I think lover, I think what they should do is whoever's got billion dollars go, this is $1 billion.

Speaker 1:          00:48:19       You need a lot more than that to secure it. If you like to have scientists that can have this billion dollars, if he could cure it. No, it's, it doesn't matter you the funding in order to, uh, to make a drug that's capable of doing something as incredible as curing HIV or curing aids. I mean right now they've got them apparently now again, when I'm discussing this, I have zero medical background or just two dudes talk to idiots that happened to be dirty and smarter than the other, but we don't have, I don't know who the fuck is up tomorrow. Leave it out there. You know, big words. I'm sure. I know it does it. I'm saying it again. It's just the words that they use, actual mechanism behind the smart. It's very debatable, but the look, the bottom line is, I don't know shit about medical science at all, so anything that I say about a, about what's, what's good for you and bad for you, it's just fucking pure speculation.

Speaker 1:          00:49:14       However, what I understand is that they've got it down to a point where you don't even test positive for HIV anymore. Like you. They've had people that are HIV positive, but the drug goes into such remote places and squashes out the virus in such a way that even though you still have it, it's like, and you could shut it. I don't know. That's the question. I don't know. None of it makes any sense to me. It's chaos, but viruses don't make any sense to me. Bacteria, it doesn't make any sense to me. The fact that you need bacteria makes no fucking sense to me. Can like a virus. It lives forever. That's a good question. Some of them, they've eradicated and they've come back. You know, like some of them they got, well, that's one of the things that people get so upset about with anti vaccine people.

Speaker 1:          00:49:58       It's like, do you understand that they have taken shit like polio and made it almost nonexistent? They've taken things like smallpox and made them almost nonexistent. What about this mers or mar immerse takers like has that always been around or is that just like something comes out of nowhere and they ain't got to be like, oh, it was the Middle East thing. How much is this manmade? You know, like, well, don't get crazy. I will. All that is the thing that people do do this. I do have a a little bit of information about this because I did a whole special on it on that Scifi show on infectious diseases and I got a chance to talk to a lot of these guys. They're not making any new diseases. They don't have to make any new diseases. They have some shit weaponized smallpox that if they released, we're Foxville.

Speaker 1:          00:50:47       Yeah, they had this stuff in mass quantities in Russia and that's a fact. There's no need to make any new thing like mers. Mers is not very effective because look, it's not spreading. There's a very small amount of people have gotten and they were talking about it years ago. It's a very dangerous and deadly disease once people get it, but there's not that many people that have it. It's a very small, I only think like six people ever have died from it. The problem is it's like half the people that get it. It's, it's just bird flu. New Bird flu is not new. All of these fluids. This is another thing that I found out during the show. They're almost all of them come from livestock, whether it's a swine flu, whether it's the avian flu, bird flu, all these different flu's a shit ton of them come from the way people raise animals in factory to make love to them. No. Okay. That's up. There was a lot of fucking, and that was the aids one. The monkey,

Speaker 6:          00:51:41       Sam Kennison.

Speaker 1:          00:51:45       Yeah, that Sam kinisons bit UN aids. It was like, at the time it was so taboo and so wrong, but there's so much of it that was so fucking true and funny. The thing that we're used to like, you know, he's like

Speaker 6:          00:51:58       Sam, they say Sam, Hey, just a heterosexual disease. Straight people die from it. Do they want fucking guy? Fuck you. It's not our, it's not our fucking dance.

Speaker 1:          00:52:16       That's a horrible joke. Terrible. And mean. Who is someone's talking about? Right. They were, they went back and they watch Eddie Murphy's like delirious or raw, I forgot. And they were watching it with their kids and then at some point you had to stop and go, listen, we don't talk like this anymore because it was like very raw and obviously not just raw, like the difference between like a gay joke and an evil like homophobic joke. There's a difference in, they used to that what used to be pretty normal, like an evil, homophobic joke in the 80s was pretty normal. Like you could get away with it. Yeah. You know, and now it's like, whoa. It's like you can't just shit on someone just for their sexual orientation. Yeah. It's gotta be an observation of it. I mean, what is the line on that? Because I feel like some people think that if you just bring it up, it's homophobic and I just completely disagree with that.

Speaker 1:          00:53:12       Yes, that's, I agree with you 100% that the subjects are always going to be completely open. You can talk about anything you want on stage. People may or may not find it funny. There's the question is do you find it funny and can you find a way to relay it to an audience? If that's your intent. Just finding humor in life. There's nothing wrong with that. And you can, you know, you could talk about any subject you want, but that's not what they were doing back then. They were just destroying, destroying gay people. You know, you remember when US Sebastian Bach from skid row had a t shirt on. AIDS kills fags dead. Yeah, man. You could find it. Pull up the picture. It was a huge controversy, but it's like, why would you say that? It's so weird that is as homophobic as you can get.

Speaker 1:          00:54:01       It's probably the worst it, well, it's just right up there with God hates fags. That, uh, Phelps guy that died recently walking around with a shirt on like that. Like someone thought that was cool. It's cooler than not wearing that shirt. There it is. Is there irony loss in the way he's pouting with his gay lips and his fucking Farrah Fawcett hair and just that whole loop of that music genre was all dudes who tried to look like chicks. Yeah. You remember when you first saw the poisoned CD, you're like, those are some smoking hot chicks and your friend's like, dude, those are, Gosh. You're like, ah, I want weird. What a weird time in music, man. I, I blame Rob Halford Cause Rob Halford of Judas priest who was gay as fuck and coolest shit all around bad motherfucker. He, he's such a bad mother fucker that he was wearing like obvious gay biker garb and he got people to think that gay biker garb, like onstage with something cool manly shit.

Speaker 1:          00:54:59       And because he was sort of closeted, you know, I guess it was understood in the industry, but they didn't talk about it, but he didn't hide it. You know, it's one of those things. It wasn't like Liberace, you know, back in the just flaming constantly ask him when he was going to get married. It was, it was a different sort of a scenario but rob Halford, God, he changed like metal. They all started dressing like that. They all started dressing like gay bikers and I think that during that time everybody got so perplexed. I think bad gay motherfuckers, just bad ass gay dudes infiltrated the music business and got everyone to dress like a homeowner. Yeah, they all, everyone was wearing spandex tights and their cock was pin there to pick up. Everybody looked like that's not, but that's not for women. Like that flowing lock thing with a tight pants.

Speaker 1:          00:55:46       Chicks like the Marlboro man. They want a guy who's built like Don Frye who's got like, they know he's got a six pack under that like fucking cowboy shirt, but they don't see, they want to see it on the outside. That's a guy thing like guys want to see like yoga pants on a chick. Like a girl could walk down the street with yoga pants and a camel toe. Totally acceptable. Guy Walked down the street with fucking ballet tights on and no shirt. Jesus Christ is Hugh Jackman. That's not real. Yeah. No it's not. Come on. That's not real. That guy's face is Photoshop. You're so full of shit. Look at that guy on the left last night. The lighting, the lighting is totally bad. Not Real there they have their shadows are in the wrong direction. Hugh Jackman Shadow's coming towards us. This guy's shadow is going towards his left shoulder in unreal. Kicked the fuck out of here. How dare you think that Dude's HGH in? Uh, probably. Yeah, if he's smart. Shred it out, Bro. We were, for whatever reason, Brian was obsessed with the fact that Hugh Jackman was Kay. He wouldn't stop talking about it. It's fucking hands were moving. He kept puffing on the glass. Dick. He was like, I hear you. Jacqueline's gay. There's multiple pictures of him holding hands with guys. Come on, son is multiple pictures of me with big black dicks in my mouth.

Speaker 1:          00:57:06       Hold on a second. Back that up because one of those look real. Go ahead. Go piss you weak bladder at son of a bitch. Who's the guy with the beard is a Wolverine Fan. He's telling them how I'm watching that movie. Uh, made him cure cancer. That's what it is. So Hugh Jackman's guy in the right, let me see, is he really holding that guy's hand or is that a perspective, that perspective thing. Who cares if he's gay? But it's a weird thing like a chicken. Be Gay like a Jodie foster and everyone knows she's gay. She's out. It's all good. And she could play elite. Okay. That is super gay. God sexy. He looks so, he's looked so big.

Speaker 1:          00:57:48       But you know, if a woman like Jodie foster be decides to come out and you know, proclaims that she's gay, that's not real either. Stop it. Just stop. Stop. Now it's a my pants. What's this guy doing? It's talking about cook. I didn't play on this. Um, a woman could still play a heterosexual woman, but a man has a really hard time unless it's that, um, the dude on how I met your mother. What's his name? Neil. Neil. Patrick Harris. Neil Patrick Harris. His case. He's still lovable. Yeah. Well he's not just level, but he plays a guy who's like a ladies' man on the show, which is quite hilarious. But you know why I think though, I think because he had some money from that Howard Kumar movie where he plays such a pimp. I think that's, that's kind of Burton people's thoughts still. I never saw that movie, so I have no idea what the white castle, I never saw it.

Speaker 1:          00:58:38       Never know. But he's a funny guy and a talented actor. I think that's more likely than ever. And I think we're, we're in a different time. I think people like supporting the idea of a guy being out and open. You know? I think especially in Hollywood, that's like the place where people, but when it comes to movies, movies are a different animal because movies, you got to sell tickets, you got to sell hard fucking tickets. And you know, if the Midwest, no worries. I'm just talking. The Midwest comes over and you know, they see that some big gay guy like Hugh Jackman is in some fucking movie where he's playing a girlfriend too. Who's the chick that's always on sports illustrated? Kate Upton. Oh, Kate Upton. He's playing Kate Upton's husband. You're going to like get the fuck out of it. Yeah, he's good. He wins. He wins. He wins.

Speaker 1:          00:59:26       He's big. He's gay. He's beautiful. He's got, he's got it both ways. The New York Times apparently wrote a thing about him being by, right. That's what you guys are saying. Yeah. But I think that's just someone's wishful thinking because he does musicals. Yeah. No. If you like theater, musical theater, apparently you've got to be gay. Yeah. But manage. If you were straight, how much asks you be crushing, cause it'd be you, a bunch of gay dudes and chicks everywhere if you are in musical theater. Yeah. If you were straight guy, musical theater, do you really think women are the primary viewers of musical theater? I think there's, I mean, acting and dancing. How dare you. Dancers in musical theater pull you, push your seat back and think this over, put your hand on your Chin like this and do this. So Fuck No. The whole room is not gay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:11       The whole audiences, gay and menopausal women, that's who goes to see musicals in the few confused young girls who eventually abandon the art form and then just go to, they want to look cool in college. They say, Oh my God, I love musicals. And then they go and they realized musicals are dog shit. If it was any good, it would be in a goddamn movie. All right. You'd be able to see things happen. Real monsters. Amazing. Blowguns it is, but like a comedy performance than it is a musical. I mean they call it a musical, but it's really like a sketch comedy performance, like a Saturday night live piece that goes on for an hour and a half. I mean, that's really what it was like really good. But to call that a musical, no, musicals are drab. There's like fucking, there's songs in there about romance and love and the two people meet again, they're nonsense.

Speaker 1:          01:00:57       We have movies now. If you want to tell me Chicago chicks don't like to the musical Chicago, they'd love to tell you. I've seen the musical Chicago and it is dog shit, dog shit. And I went to watch a very good friend of mine. I went to support her and sit there and watch Chicago. And when it was the halfway through, we were all sitting around, we're all talking and really, so what do you think? Wow. It's really, really good. Like everybody was like, you know, like hedging the words. I go, it's dog shit. It's watchable dog shit. And finally the older gentlemen in the group who we look to for guidance, it goes, it's, I've never been a fan of the art form. It's fucking terrible. And we were like, it's not good, right? Like what's going on here? Like you go see, go see, they don't do cats anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:01:39       But if you went to see cats halfway through cats, he'd be like, what the fuck am I watching? What are you doing to me here? This is a murderous assault on my attention span. And somehow I know that you've convinced to, I'm sure a lot of people think that in my act, but that's fine. You don't have to go see it. All right. Some people like it. Some people like cats. I get that as well. I just don't understand those people at all. Have you heard of, Oh, have you heard of that movie? That's a like or I mean that play, that's like we're guys all act like horses. I there's like three. Yeah, I heard that's pretty sweet. You should go. You should go and give a full lines. Kre King. I see lions fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here. I would say I saw Cirque de Solei and that was dope.

Speaker 1:          01:02:27       Cirque de Solei is because it's uh, it's like watching the Olympics with music and it's like you're watching people do shit that's impossible. Guys doing handstands and they have like a woman like attached to their hand and they were like supporting her. Like they have one hand on the ground, one hand up in the air that's holding a woman you like. How are you even fucking doing that? The guys like there's guys who are doing handstands on each other's arms. Unbelievable. It's insane. You feel so weak and feeble when you go to see more so than going to see the UFC, you feel weak and feeble. When you go to Cirque de Solei cause you watch them do things. Do you like how long would it take me to even come close to being to fuck, I can't do that. If I have those skills, I become a Ninja.

Speaker 1:          01:03:09       Did someone die recently? It started. So yeah, they did some, but it wasn't, no, it was Ringling brothers. It was both. It was Cirque de Solei and then there was like nine people that died. I went and saw a show where the guy missed it, missed the thing and he just felt hope and the whole room was just quiet. How was he? Uh, he got back up. Up Man. Whoa. I'm sure he took a beating off stage. Fall only like about six or seven feet. That's still, man, that jumped from the ceiling. That would fuck you up. It's like, well, how tall is that ceiling is about eight feet. No. Yeah, that's good. I got to be more jammy. 10, eight, eight, nine two the droplets go nine. Okay, let's go nine. You, you know, that would suck. That would suck. I would suck and hurt, but we're so weak.

Speaker 1:          01:03:57       My cat is 17 fucking years old. I got a cat that I've had forever, man. My sister gave him to me, her to me, she had a bunch of kittens. There were all these wacky kittens and her cat. She had this one cat and they like you. They lived in this rural place and they didn't fix their cat and their cat one up getting fuck by some other, cause I've heard the cats fucking outside my door. It sounds like murders going on. Well, anybody who does that, you release a male cat. Like you're creating a real fucking problem and an a spade and unspayed female cat. You're creating a real fucking problem. Like feral cats are fucking huge issue. Not just because of the fact that they decimate bird populations and things along those lines, but also because of diseases they carry. They're the number one purveyor of this toxo plasma.

Speaker 1:          01:04:45       Uh, in toxoplasmosis, a bacteria or a disease rather parasite that people have really common in third world countries, dirty pussies effects your affects. Your brain does a lot of fucked up shit to your oh yeah. Yeah. And it's super common and it, it also, the cat shit gets in the meat. It's like, it's like a real issue with, uh, with fucking cats. Is this something about like some bacteria that gets in or a virus, virus? It gets into a mouse's head and he has it to run inside the, it's a rat. If it's a, what it does is, I've talked about this many times in this podcast, but it hasn't, it's been a long time, more than a year. The way it works is it rewires the rats sexual reward system and it makes a rat attracted, sexually attracted to the smell of cat piss to the point where it's testy swell up and he gets like, he's in estrus, he's like, he's hurting, he's got blue balls because he smells this cat piss like red ban on hot rod, 5,000 red ban all day.

Speaker 1:          01:05:45       So all day. So he essentially on a double dose of Cialis with, uh, an added a acorns. It, it's no, well it does a weird thing to um, their, their fear system. It hijacks their fear system so they're not afraid of cats anymore. If there's videos like pull up his video, Brian. Um, it's a toxo plasmosis infected rat chases cat. This rat is running after the cat trying to get some cat piss. It's like go running up to the cat's ass. Like has no fear of the cats. So cats eat these rats and then the cats get it. And apparently it doesn't really affect the behavior of the cats because cats are evil from the jump, that evil from the evil, from the jump. It doesn't make a more evil. They don't get the worst roommate ever. They're like, pick up my shit. Yeah, feed me.

Speaker 1:          01:06:37       I'm out of here. This is the video. These cats are like, what the fuck is going on? I look this rat. You could kill them the language, but this, this rat starts going towards these cats and he's like literally trying to get at their, their bag. Give me that buck that Iran is not afraid of. He just jumped on. That cat's back. Look how crazy that is. Give me that. But Yo dude, how crazy is that? That rat just jumped on. That cat's back. They're not afraid of peep of cats at all. Like how does that even happen? How does that sort gangster man, they really are gangster animals. But why does that virus come around or that bacteria, whatever it is, and how's that form and how did know to do that to that mouse and make that happen? And there's only one answer.

Speaker 1:          01:07:22       Jesus. There is the Jesus man. Jesus. The Jesus is the answer. It must be God. Why? Jesus? Yeah, we'll look. God has a plan. Sam. That cat's ass. Yes. Yes. That people right now angry. They're angry. And you know why you're angry. You know why you're angry? Because what I'm saying, it makes you feel like what you believe is silly. And do you know why? Why wait for it? Because of what you believe is silly. Silly talk wasn't silly. I wouldn't be able to make you angry if like people were joking around about what men when I was sex with women. Well cause it feels good. Oh, you'd be like, okay, if that's the reason why Hetero phobic doesn't work. Like if homophobic people looking at us like, Eh, yeah, what do you, but you fucked girls, Eh, what do you a breeder ill he'd be like, okay, you're just being mean.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       You're not hurting my feelings. I feel your mean energy. But this shit doesn't work. Doesn't change how I feel about life. You know? That's what's going on Sam. I get it man. It's just weird. And I was talking about this on stage the other day about how like, is this a bit you working on another bit right now? No, but I'm just saying that it goes along the lines of what you're saying is just like, you know, there's all this, these people who are conservative morals and stuff and they don't, oh you shouldn't do this, shouldn't do that, shouldn't do that because you've been told us over these years, but yet over the last century or so, most of those thoughts have been debunked. Meaning there's places where people allow what you're saying is evil. It's going to ruin society and a society is going to crumble. People allow this happen and it doesn't.

Speaker 1:          01:09:02       Yeah. And so what are you saying? Cause if like all this stuff where you're like you shouldn't pay for sacs. He shouldn't do drugs, you shouldn't do all this shit cause it's gets the, the, you know the god yet in Amsterdam, all of that is legal and there's not fires coming from the skies and monkey find monkeys, tea bag and everybody and you know, just like it just is, it's been proven that that what suppression is not good for people that don't like it. It's a bad way to raise children. It's a bad way to raise a nation, right? It's just people don't like suppression. It's really that simple. They don't like it. They got upset. [inaudible] you're another person and you're telling the guy what to do, telling the guy can't shirk off. What does that guy want to do? He wants a jerk off as soon as he gets away from you and wants a book doors and just jerk off in privacy and then feel terrible about it and then repent and you know, Kellogg, no sense.

Speaker 1:          01:09:52       You know, Kellogg's, the guy from the cereal, Kellogg's cereal. W The reason why this is you got to read this book, sex at dawn by this Guy Chris Ryan, podcast guest, fascinating guy. Um, I've read that book. I've done a bunch of podcasts with him and Duncan Trussell. He's a really interesting guy, but one of the things the, he sent me hip to his like Kellogg's, you can find us online, created cornflakes, created mild tasting food to keep people from getting sexually aroused. Said that he lived with his wife for like 40 years and bragged about having never having had sex with her, but kept a male intern who would give him daily enemas.

Speaker 1:          01:10:30       That's fucking Kellogg's. So think about that. Repressing sexual thoughts, unbelief, pressing and actively, actively repressing sexual thoughts. And yet obviously fighting off the gay tooth claw and Fang, right? Obviously fighting off the gay. The guy had a male assistant who's mustache gay, he's gay as fuck face boy. Put a leather, uh, paper boy cap on him and uh, no shirt and cutoff jeans. Okay, you see it? Please do. Let me do that right now, Jack. Now, I mean if you see that guy's face, just what a great book, you'll probably get an even better picture of them where you could go full, full fucking body and then go with the color specific thing. Mcdonald, get an obvious Photoshop, make it. I think it really looked real.

Speaker 4:          01:11:16       I wonder if she was getting Dick on the side. Mrs Kellogg's. Oh, sh Mrs Kellogg was fucking a personal trainer. They didn't even have post personal trainers back then. She invented, vented it. She'd vented just so that she can have somebody touch me. Did Jesus touch me? Unbelievable.

Speaker 1:          01:11:33       Well, that's people, man. People that are suppressing other people are usually doing it to try to suppress him. Something in themselves.

Speaker 4:          01:11:40       That's why a lot of conservatives, I just, I just, it's like you're lying. I think a lot. I'm not judging all, but it's like when you sit there and you say, Oh, you shouldn't do this, this and this. Most of the time you're doing this, this and this. You just want to put laws on other people. Like I go to Arizona a lot to do gigs and it's a fun state to do gigs, but they have all these crazy laws. Yeah, they party more than anybody I know. So it's like they're just making laws for other people that doesn't apply to them. Why do you think that is? What do you think that is? I don't get, I don't know why, man. You're right. It's fear. It's also theirs. Here's the other, the

Speaker 1:          01:12:16       problem with fear and this idea of everyone should be loving. There's certain folks that are already done. See this is one of the real problems, okay? This is one of the real problems with society as a whole. Cultural in general and just human interaction. This is one of the real problems is that some people already done, somebody has made them, they've done a piss poor job of feeding them, raising them, and then sending them out into the world and they're fucked. These people are fucked. If you can run into those people, they can ruin your fucking life. And that's a fact. So there's no way of fixing them either, by the way, they might fix themselves, but it depends on the severity of how fucked up they are. Some people are too far fucked. You never bring them back. And those people are out there wandering through the world too.

Speaker 1:          01:13:10       So when people see that and they see that you can't treat that with love. And some people say, well, you got to treat him with love. And they go, oh you fucking liberals ruin everything. And then you have this division between people that are conservative and that care and then people who are liberal than care and the liberal people think the conservatives are cruel and the conservative people think that the liberals have, you know, some idealized view of the world that doesn't work. It only works because hard man are out there doing the bad deeds to keep the world safe and they fucking support the troops on their bumper. The real problem is it's a mass, it's huge. It's a mass. It's constantly changing and it's going on all the time, whether you like it or not. When we sit in this podcast room for three hours and talk, there's murders and rapes and robberies and car accidents and lies and there's just so many people that it's going on in some way, shape or form.

Speaker 1:          01:14:03       Someone's doing something fucked up. Yes, and that's why we need to figure out how, first and foremost, how fix people that are fucked up. That would should be before we talk about going to Mars, before we taught what we should be concentrating as a whole, as a co, as a culture, is not just like figuring out how to fucking frack or figuring out how to pull out of Afghanistan, how you fix all these fucking crazy people. How do we think some, can you fix them? Could it be done with mushrooms and Mtma and electro shock therapy? Can we change their blood? Can we add artificial fucking genes to their system that induces empathy? Is there a way, is if there's not a way, then we're always going to have this vicious cycle of dealing with shitty people. Sheedy people making more shitty people. Should he be bill fucking shitty people up?

Speaker 1:          01:14:52       People dealing with people who fucked them up their whole life in therapy their whole life. You know, constantly talking about the abuse had happened and then when they were wrong. Cause it's defined them as a person. And I also feel that there's so many people making money off of Shitty people. You know, the drug war, the, uh, the, uh, uh, privatized prisons and stuff like that, that you're fighting against this group who it's not in their best interest that these people get fixed. Yeah. Well, it's like anything else, anything that comes along, even if it's a legit issue like global climate change. You know, the real issue that a lot of people have when it comes to global climate change is when you see a guy like Al Gore who's made a fuck load of money off of climate change, then people start saying, oh, it's a business.

Speaker 1:          01:15:35       These kinds of invested interest. There's thousands and thousands of people. Like, yes, but still the world's the fucking, the climate is changing. No, but yes, yes, people are making money off it, but it doesn't mean that it's all bullshit. Like there's a lot going on here, man. It's not an, it's like almost everything else in life. It's not a black and white issue. There's a whole lot of different fucking things going on. There's, there's people that are bad, then there's a problem and then there's people that are bad that that profit off of a real problem too. Did you watch the last vice I or two vices ago when they were doing about the drought in Texas? Oh, I didn't see that. People were just praying to the God for this and then they bring, do you believe in global warming? Nah, not really. But then they would have singing hymns to God too.

Speaker 1:          01:16:18       It's just so interesting about how like people have manipulated other people to believe in their best interest when you're like, it's like, well, it's not just that though. It's also voluntary. I've seen people that want to believe that the world is not changing temperature. I've seen people that want to believe in global warming simply because it's like the conservative viewpoint. They're like, oh, come on. It ain't cause they've been told that from the top. You know, I had this guy, Randall Carlson on the podcast recently. You've talked about climate change throughout the history, the known history of the earth. And it was incredibly fascinating and he absolutely believes that a human beings, and you know our carbon footprint plays a part in, in global warming. But he said that the real issue is there's a lot of other factors that play a part and they have throughout history, like we're co concerning ourselves primarily with people, with what people have done.

Speaker 1:          01:17:09       And we have done a fucked up job on this earth and he said, I'm more concerned with the particulate matter that like burning coal and pollution and stuff, but what it does to our air quality than I am the actual warming. Cause he started going off about global cooling and about what it used to be like here on earth. And it was one of the most terrifying podcast I've ever listened to. Jesus this cause he knows a lot and he's not just making shit up. He's talking about ice core samples. You're talking about known history. Even just the known history. Totally noncontroversial known history that all scientists accept is that 10,000 years ago North America was almost entirely covered with ice and that there was a two mile high thick wall of ice over Canada. Oh my God. Two miles. It's insane. It's unbelievably insane.

Speaker 1:          01:17:57       It's unbelievably insane and it's a fact. Oh man, that's real. It's like this fine line between wanting to know the facts and just like, it's out of my hands, dude. He was also talking about some without a doubt, beyond a shadow of a doubt, factual evidence about the amount of species that used to exist during that time that died off. I got a huge percentage of all the animals that were alive back then. Our jobs are gone. That's just 10,000 years ago. It was like unbelievably scary. It's just a cycle in a weird way. It's not just a cycle. He believes that it ended abruptly and it probably ended because of a meteor impact. That cycle was like how people dealt with life. They're just like those people that live up in Edmonton. You know, the people that were in a place like Canada, the guy, there was nobody there.

Speaker 1:          01:18:42       The reason why there's so few fucking people in Canada and they're so cool, it's because they've only been there for a couple of hundred years. Everything's fresh and new, like a new chick fucking nobody there. There was native Americans, you know, some of them had ventured up there, excuse me. But most of them, you know, most of them fucking came, you know, around the same time that settlers came to North America, you know, the, the Columbus days, that's most of the, uh, the, the people that wound up settling up there in Canada before that man, not much. And well, you know, why is that? Because if you fuck, a thousand years ago was under ice, two miles giant glaciers do. And I was there three feet dropped the day I flew into of snow. I'm like, this is insane. Like giant walls of snow in between each lane as you're driving where there should have been like traffic, little, little things, ma'am.

Speaker 1:          01:19:31       Boom. Just giant walls of snow. And occasionally polar bears and occasionally Paul, I haven't seen one in Edmonton. Edmonton, a woman was working on a rig recently. She got killed, eaten alive by a black bear. What? Yeah. Ah, which is rare. Blackberries rezone people, but if they catch you slipping bears, you know, they'll look at you though I might be able to make this happen. I mean the child down on that tasty hot pocket, you know what they're really worried about. They're really worried about hybrids. Grizzlies and polar bears are apparently getting their freak on little interracial. So hybrids

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       are very different than the regular grid disaster. Stronger Blake Griffin's well, they're more like polar bears who are strictly carnivores. So different seen a grizzly bear and a polar bears. If you see a grizzly bear, that bear might not give a fuck about you. Have you see a grizzly bear out in the fields and they're eating berries, that bear might just look at go, I mean, I don't give a fuck. It's plenty of food. He's not hungry at all. So the build a bear has a belly full of berries and it's just sitting there chewing along. It doesn't give a fuck at all. But if a grizzly bear sees you and you're hungry,

Speaker 1:          01:20:35       is that the guy hanging out? Yeah, it looks pretty good. Kellogg mean Kellogg. I think your chest tattoo. Very Brock Lesnar is a new thing I'm working on. Um, a polar bear sees you. You better run if not worth running. Cause all polar bears do is eat meat. That's all they do. So anything that's moving a polar bear is going to eat. There's no berries. So I don't go where polar bears are. That's a good move. That's why I go with the La Jolla California. That's a good move. Where they laugh at me when I run there. There's a polar bear den. The zoo though. Careful that motherfucker gets out. You're doomed. You will find me. Cause he sees how slow I run. He'll give you a thumbs up and let you go. It's like when you see a retarded fish, see a fisherwoman sideways. You don't try to snag it. Let that one go. That one going down river. Did you see all the sardines that are washing up in Venice right now? I guess because the water got so hot that it's oxygen and tons and tons and so like now sharks are just dying and all these fish keeper dying because there's no oxygen. Cause there's so many sardines. Yeah. They call it dead zones. Apparently it happens all the time. And the ocean smells like ass hole. Yeah, it's bad. You know what a good ass. I'll leave it

Speaker 2:          01:21:42       found out a way that they think they're going to be able to bring back a plant vegetation and shit in the ocean and a sort of recede areas and a [inaudible] the oxen and Jane the Ocean kitchenaid and it involves dumping iron in the water. Like iron scraps and iron is a really interesting thing. I read about it. I'll pull it up. Um, the, the idea was that dumping iron into the ocean would increase the amount of plankton and that all these plants would grow off of the a rusting iron. Oh, the metal and the iron would actually facilitate plant lysis. Yeah. And that plant life would uh, develop more oxygen in the ocean. It was really kind of interesting shit, man. Dumping Iron in the,

Speaker 1:          01:22:28       there are some people are way smarter than I am. Yes. Yeah. In this room, dude, I'm a human being. I know. I hear you. I have feelings. I know you do. Thank you dude. Jesus Christ. What do you need? Oh, cookie. There I put it. Okay. Stop. That's enough.

Speaker 2:          01:22:49       Yeah. Adding iron to the oceans. They're slowing down global warming. This is the idea and they're throwing, this is a weird fucking idea, but it kind of makes sense. The premise is simple. It says iron acts as a fertilizer for many plants and some like the phytoplankton that forms the base line of marine food web need to grow. They needed to grow and adding iron to the water stimulates phytoplankton growth, which in turn gobble up carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. This results in a decrease in carbon dioxide and reduces temperature. Since carbon dioxide is one of the main gases responsible for trapping heat on the earth's surface through the greenhouse effect. Interesting. Unbelievable. There's interesting shit. Yeah. That's the other thing that this guy Randall Carlson was talking about is how, um, this, uh, increase in carbon dioxide that we have there. They're also directly correlating it with an increase in plant growth, which is kind of fucked because we always think of like people adding carbon dioxide to the air being a poison and they were poisoning the air.

Speaker 2:          01:23:55       But the reality is that plants need carbon dioxide to grow. So it's not saying that you should go out and burn carbon dioxide to fucking help the plants, but it's one of those things again where it's, it's not black and white for station. They're cutting down the plants mean there's last plants to take in the CO2. And that's where the problem is right now. No, that's, no, but okay. But what he's saying is there's more forest than before that forests are actually increasing in size and there's more plants into the plant. Growth is actually increasing because of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But there's definitely concern that people have, like in the Amazon, a lot of different places that people are chopping down. Well what the real problem with what they're doing in the Amazon is that those, they're changing the whole weather system in those places because these, these plants, they're responsible for, like they're there, the whole ecosystem is wrapped around these plants and he chopped them down.

Speaker 2:          01:24:50       Then you have these dry areas is exposed to the sun where they weren't exposed to the sun before because this is deep canopy of leaves and the rain, the [inaudible], yeah, this is just flat. And so then it becomes, they don't have the root system. So then you get mud slides and then though the, the, uh, the ground, it becomes very difficult to grow crops on it. It's really kind of fucking crazy. Like what they're doing. They're just chopping down trees and thousands and thousands of acres just damn deforestation. Yeah, that's not good. What about cows farting? Do you ever buy into that? That that's a big problem? I always feel like they just picked something that they could blame it on and like there's way more people. No. But the, the amount of impact that a cow has is way more powerful than the amount of impact that a person has. But there's way more people. Yes. Cow farts. Every cow, there's probably what? 100200300 400 I don't know. But here it says, my dad can crushed scientists say cow farts are more dangerous than they feared. This is trip man. There's a real study. How'd he has revealed that the amount of methane greenhouse gas 20 times more potent, but far less prevalent than CO2? Well, so it's, it would be 20 cows to every person

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       to balance that out or 20 people to every cows rather. It's about balance that out because it's 20 times more potent if a cow was the size of a person, but it cows way bigger than a person. So it's even more so if is product five times bigger than a person, so instead of 20 times, probably a hundred times more impact. That's my unscientific calculation. Cow Fart is 20 times in the environment. That's crazy. 20 times more potent, far less prevalent than CO2 released into the u s atmosphere. It's significantly higher than previously thought. We find greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural and fossil fuel extraction and processing. Uh, I, he oil or natural gas are likely a factor of two or greater than cited in existing studies. So agriculture just by itself is a big impact. Unbelievable man. Blessing methane is a fucking issue though, man. When I used to visit my parents, my parents used to live in Pennsylvania.

Speaker 1:          01:27:05       I was driving from New York to a rural Pennsylvania and there's this stretch of highway where it's all farms, dairy farms and slaughterhouses and shit, I guess saw cows. It's unbelievably bad smelling like you can't imagine these poor fucking people that have to live in these areas. And it was hot. It was in the summer. We'll just that it goes back to, I've been to some people just accept that I'm from kind of that area. I'm from Cortland, New York, which is, is a Pennsylvanian Cortland, ours. Same kind of country. You know what I'm saying? I got tough. I have tons of cows in my hometown, man. Really? Yeah. I mean, I didn't realize how redneck my hometown was until I left it. What does it smell like when you go back? Because they say that all factory senses like the sense of smell is a newer everywhere you can pack your senses.

Speaker 1:          01:27:51       The sense of smell is something that alters, um, or it, it only picks up a alterations and smell. It doesn't pick up constant smells. So if you live in a town town stinks like some of those, uh, industrial you ever been in New Jersey, when you drive it through New Jersey and you smell industrial pollution, those towns, they don't smell it. You only smell it because you're driving for fresh air or reasonably fresh air into that area. That's how you used to be. When I went to Niagara Falls, had this giant factory called Hooker Chemicals and that's what the name of it was. Hooker Chemicals. And you would drive in and you're like this day like saber plants, paper stink like up in Portland. Now here's the thing about hooker chemicals. It's pretty much been closed down, but they won't completely close it down because if they completely close it down then they're going to have to go through and clean it up.

Speaker 1:          01:28:37       All the environmental cleanup. So they just keep like 30 employees in this giant factory. That's just huge. And they just keep it open. Hooker gets cheaper for them to do that than it is for them to hire someone to come in and clean it up. That makes sense. There was something, a love canal. Do you remember the old love canal? A thing that's hooker chemicals. They dumped all these these name company. Yep. And they're still open. Yeah. And they won't close it down because then they have to clean up the environmental mistakes. That's awful. That's weird. Did they let them get away with that? Well I, yeah, that's good because it's like a one of those legacy companies cause it's been around for a long time. I think that's just probably the rule. If you demolish or shut some down, you've got to clean it up so it's environmentally safe.

Speaker 1:          01:29:24       And so these guys just keep it going cause it's cheaper to do that. Dan is so fucked up. That's so weird. Well it's the same thing with like GM right now with their cars. Right. They'd like, they knew forever. Don't they do something where they like they guesstimate how much it would cost to do a recall versus how much it would cost to go to court and if really yeah, if something's cheaper they go with the cheaper option. Oh Man, I'm not sure dude. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure about that. I think they do that. I think that was the big thing on uh, what was the, what was it? You got to pull that shit up. You can't just say that. That is, if, if, if it's cheaper to go to court, they'll go to court. But if it's Oh, you shut.

Speaker 1:          01:30:11       Shut the fuck up dude. Seriously. Okay, I'll shut up. You got to Google that. We can't say that. You can't say that when it comes to cars, man, everything comes to any major corporation. They'll do the re what's going to cause us more a recall or going to the court if it, if it recalls cheaper, they'll do that if course cheaper than go to cheat. I, I've heard it. I don't, I'll put I think can't, you can't just say that when you say something like that. Like you gotta really know what you're saying. I do. I you're saying GM, you're saying like a specific company. Yes. Somebody might have gotten in trouble for some sort of recall, but it could've been a safety issue. Google that. Okay. I'll Google it right now. So let me Google it. Gm. Am I saying okay. Avoids recall. Look Google, Google, whether corporations decide whether recall or court is cheaper, they go with the cheaper option.

Speaker 1:          01:31:03       Can you do that? I'm doing that right now. It's from a movie cause I remember something like that like like right now and there's not enough people that are having the problem so we're not going to worry about it. They, they guesstimate if it's cheaper for them too. You can't just say that. Here's the problem with just saying something like that. You have to really know what the fuck you're saying. You've got to really know what you're saying because if you just say it, then you don't have to do that anymore. It's 2014 it did actually find out. So if you want to talk about something and you want to talk about something as serious as someone not doing a recall because they'd rather just like get sued because they can save money that way you gotta know what the fuck you're saying. But I'm saying now I know that. But you don't know that because you're not pulling up any facts. You're not stating any guys in here. The super computer, which was great hair. Dawn is some legacy shit. You don't have to do that anymore. You have a fucking iPhone. You know how to get online. Battery's dead. Oh, we'll plug it in. So it's an old one. Oh, well you fucking cheap bastard. Go get a

Speaker 2:          01:31:59       new one. When they get done with this. I'm sure there's been some problems with, uh, oversight. I'm sure there's been some problems with recalls, but saying that they like actively got together and said, hey, let's just, uh, not fucking, let's just not recall these things and just take our role, our chances with the lawsuit because the study has shown that we can save money if we go that route. I believe that's what happened. I have no, can't just say that. Okay. I will. That's how you get sued. I understand that you could get sued, Sam. What if they come, what? GM comes down with the hammer of the law? Well, they can take what I don't have. Why would you say that you have a number 11 on the fuck it's called. You can do it for the move. You believe in yourself. Believe in yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:32:44       Go Rocky. When rocky, believe in yourself. Believe in yourself. Do you ever thought about doing a song like a wacky songs go along with, I do like red bands, great songs though. He has a, he should do some live music songs. Gm says safety is our top priority. And today's announcement puts all manufacturers on notice that they will be held accountable if they fail to quickly report and address safety related defects. Oh, this is us transportation secretary secretary, uh, Anthony Fox with two exes. He said he would continue to aggressively monitor GM efforts in this case and called on Congress to support a move to increase the penalties. The regulator can levy in cases like this from a maximum of 35,000 or 35 million to 300 million, sending an even stronger message that delays will not be tolerated. So this is what they're saying. The GM was fine.

Speaker 2:          01:33:37       35 million bucks and agreed to take part in an unprecedented oversight requirements, um, on Friday over its massive recall of cars with faulty ignition switches that have been linked to 13 deaths. The U s department of Transportation imposed the records civil penalty for the automobile makers, a failure to report a safety defect in the, in the vehicle to the federal government in a timely manner. So it didn't report it in time. What does that mean? Did they find out that it was bad and didn't report it into the scene? John Oliver's new show, but hold on. I'm sorry. We should figure this out because we've been talking about this for a while. It has something to do with that. We'll go ahead and talk.

Speaker 5:          01:34:13       All right, well here I found it an article to help you out. Sam, on Ge, uh, justice.org, there's a, uh, they all knew and failed to pdf. Uh, it's called, uh, they knew and failed to. And these are true stories of corporations that knew their products were dangerous, sometimes deadly, but they failed to do anything about it. And one of the things it says is that car company that discovers that if it does not spend $11 per car to fix a defect, a hundreds of people be horribly burned and decides it would be cheaper to let them burn. What company did that? I don't know, but it's a, it's on justice.org though. If there's a whole pdf, wait a minute, we got to read that. It says, it actually says that right here. What company? A car company just has a car company and it goes through all of it. Like here's medical devices like heart defibrillators that, that, that the title of it again, uh, it's called, they all they knew and failed to a true, true stories of course,

Speaker 4:          01:35:05       operations that knew their products were dangerous, sometimes deadly. So as far as a, this GM thing, it looks like they definitely fucked up. Well, you know, the reason I brought John Oliver because he got, he was talking about these memos in which they would tell their employees words they could not use. And it's crazy. Like they knew that these were death traps and that they were telling their employees, you, you know, you can't say certain words about the cars to describe to cars. And they were like insane words like Kevorkian, NASC and stuff like that.

Speaker 5:          01:35:40       Here's one from Firestone tires. Uh, I guess that they, uh, they knew their tires are bad. Yeah, I remember that too. I think. Oh, they finally announced they knew about it in 1997 and then finally announced in two thousands. Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:35:55       you know, I think that that was a different era. You know, that sounds crazy. But 1996, 1997, like comparing that to 2014, I mean, I know there was only 20 years ago or 18 years ago, but didn't it fascinating that that might as well been a hundred fucking years ago

Speaker 4:          01:36:08       that cause that was all pre and in terms of the internet,

Speaker 5:          01:36:10       Morton Pinto, remember the Pinto when it, we used to blow up all the time. They found out they actually had a chart where it says the 180 burned desks would be 200,000 per death. And then they just added up how much it would cost to that. And to recall a $11 perch car with uh, looks like 11 million cars and

Speaker 2:          01:36:31       affiliated it. Also the calculated severe burns, serious burns 2,100 burn vehicles and it all came to 49.5 million. Whether, but if to recall 11 million cars came to 137 million. God,

Speaker 4:          01:36:45       God, that's unbelievable. You know, the whole thing was at GM was trading their, their, their, their people, their employees, how to answer these questions, how to deflect, how to do all this stuff because they knew they had a faulty thing. And when was this, uh, this was when they discovered the faulty part in their car?

Speaker 2:          01:37:09       Well, the, the, the, uh, actual, uh, thing was an ignition switch that disabled the airbags and the Chevy cobalt and a Saturn ion. Did you have a Saturday night on what do you have? Did you have one of those a long time ago? Saturday. Sunday.

Speaker 5:          01:37:23       Oh, it's Saturday an l 200.

Speaker 2:          01:37:25       Oh, in the, uh, ion in the cobalt. They knew about it for 10 years.

Speaker 5:          01:37:30       Chevy Malibu, a general motors and new for several decades that the placement of the fuel tank and a Chevy Malibu created a big risk exploding in the event of a rear collision. So for a couple of decades they knew that that was,

Speaker 2:          01:37:41       I never even heard about that with the Malibu. I was hurting with the Pinto. That was like a joke. Yeah. The Pinto would blow up. That was the, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:37:47       I remember that. Still use the pinto as a punchline the other day and I'm like, dude, nobody gets that. And that reference, hipster, ironic at this point. It's kind of hipster, ironic old Milwaukee beer. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean that's his craziest when people start picking cash over lives. That makes it sad. Hmm. Well, it's just fucking evil. Does it now that paper that you saw, that was an internal paper, is that what that was? Yeah. This is actually from a court records where GM actually decided that they could have up to 500 fatalities per year. Each fatalities valued at $200,000 there are approximately 41 million GM automobiles currently operating on the US highways, and so they had, they were like, you know, doing the math on the cable where they doing the math about a particular issue, Chevy Mal, but yet the amount when it blows up. Oh, thank God. Yeah. It's so awful. I don't want to ever buy a Chevy again. I don't want to ever buy a Ford again either because the Ford fucking horrible. Let's not the same people anymore. Obviously, obviously it's a totally different group people, but still it's like, okay, what is it? What do we do? We do we recall or is it going to be cheaper just to go to court and deal with lawsuits? And that's what sucks. It's kind of like,

Speaker 1:          01:39:04       it's, it's Kinda like one of those things that I don't think is going to be around the future. Uh, I think with like wikileaks and shit along these lines, like you're, you're not going to be able to get away with that and not gonna be able to get away with saying that someone's life is worth $200,000. And so we have x amount of dollars invested here and you know, we'd say 50 million if we just let these people burns. Unbelievable. You all, they, they should hang them by their ankles in a, in a fucking room fold with Rad.

Speaker 4:          01:39:29       Do you think there's a level of like psychopath that you have to get to be like super high up in a corporation where people become just numbers? I think people definitely can justify a lot of shit. Like you have to, you have to detach from humanity and look at people as numbers and resources and all that, whether it's super high up, a military, super high up and corporations, any corporations. I'm not just saying like, you know, uh, oil corporations even just like high up in entertainment, like, you know, it's like sometimes I'll have to, no, you don't have to be there. But definitely a lot of the people that get there are, yeah. But, but

Speaker 1:          01:40:12       I think that's all a lot of that is going to be in the past. I think it's still going on right now to a certain extent. But transparency is making it more and more difficult to get away with shit like that. You know? It's just, it's gonna make it more and more difficult to hide. What the fuck you did. You know, when you were talking about things like this, I don't think you can hide this anymore, man. That's why, you know, going back to what we're talking about, all the hackers and all that stuff, that's why like when this net neutrality stuff is coming up, I'm like, I just don't think the hackers will let that happen. Well, they're going to have to for a while, but they're already fighting back. One Dude, uh, hacked into the, uh, FC FEC, SCC. SCC, right. That's what it is.

Speaker 1:          01:40:48       FCC, no. Federal Communications. Is that what it is? They are responsible for the Internet. Yeah. Well they're the ones making the, whether they're going to let time Warner and what was the other one? Verizon, Verizon, whatever. Ones can be huge. A T and t is about to buy direct TV. Yeah. And they're freaking out about that. But doesn't that go, who does that go back to? Was that Clinton, they've just made it so that every, you know, they could consolidate more. I'm trying to do that. But the, the point about the, what, what they're doing with the FCC is a, that these hackers attacked the, a SCCs website and turn the FCC website down to 28, eight like an old school, 28 eight pit Mod Modem. So they, they, they throttled them down. I love, this is what this what it's like stupid. Like you can't do this.

Speaker 1:          01:41:38       This is ridiculous. Yeah. Well basically making it so, uh, you know, certain websites you can get to quicker and then if they won't find mine, it's going to take forever for them to find where it is. It's evil, it's evil and it's just another opportunity that people have to corrupt something to make some money off of it. So people do, if you let them, if you let them, but I think transparency, again, like this is something they would have pulled off in the 80s like that no one would have had a say about it. No one would have even known about it. Maybe a few protests on schools. Yeah. You'd be walking through the campus and someone would be like, save net neutrality. He'd be like, Oh, save the whales, save the CEO's. I got to go to class. You know, you would, you would sort of like be into it for a little bit but not really.

Speaker 1:          01:42:17       Totally understand it. Whereas now it's like hitting your email every day. Twitter every day. And my constant here and about net neutrality, I'm constantly hearing about it. So it's this different thing where I think today it's way hard to cover shit up and the people that are involved, the last thing those motherfuckers want to do is be up for any public office or being, you know, applying for any sort of a job. And explain your role without eliminating net neutrality. And what was your position? Well, he sent the guy that who's in charge of the FCC, like used to work at like time Warner or something, has something where it's like he was high up and the customer is the king of, has a co sort of an idea what's going on. His head

Speaker 6:          01:42:54       isn't the guy where's the dresses? Isn't Wolverine Holding hands with guys? I've been so far though, with the exception of the Wolverine, I've been right on everything else,

Speaker 1:          01:43:04       right about wolverine. And you know where he got the car thing for him by the way, where it costs money. I think you got that from fight club that cause that

Speaker 6:          01:43:11       character. Actually I read that. I read, I read it

Speaker 1:          01:43:20       occasionally. Come on son. How often do you read, now I'm reading a book about the Guy who thought his dad was the, might've been the Zodiac killer. Oh you seem that were really reading that, you know, he's not the first and several of them thinking that their dads were the Zodiac killer by, have you seen that picture of his dad versus the sketch? That's identical. Really? Oh yeah. Imagine if your dad was out killing other people and you were worried that he was going to get you, but you want to keep your mouth shut about. Unbelievable because he's your dad bullying. Well, the work, cause I bought

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       the book. Hmm. Did you hear about that killer? Uh, the guy from shield that just killed his wife in front of the kids today. The one actor a shield. Think he was the guy. He was the black lab cost guy right here. Watch. Remember fucking way. I was on the news last night. They showed him my tough God. No, he killed his wife in front of their kids, the kids, and it was over a money problems. I guess he filed for bankruptcy recently. Oh, he had stopped paying off his house.

Speaker 1:          01:44:19       Ah, fuck. What is it about people I shot my wife. What? How do people get to that place? Where do you get the kill? Somebody that they loved at least at one point in time, loved. How do you get so low bankruptcy problems? That's really, that's that. Did you got to the point where you were on fucking the shield so you don't get back? Everybody was on one of the best cop shows ever, so you don't get back. Do you see it fucking guy who was just has a normal life freaking out because he, wow, look at them. They're man, Jesus Christ. It's over. That is so crazy. You imagine how crazy that guy has to be to have just shot his fucking wife. He goes from being on like one of the all time greatest cop shows has a crazy role on it. A really good role. Like here's the gay guy, remember man, you think that's drugs also? Who knows, man.

Speaker 4:          01:45:13       I've heard stories about that people owe Dan and their kids are in the house, got hanging themselves. Kids are in the house. It's like what are you doing dude

Speaker 1:          01:45:24       killing the wife man. Some, no. So, so much more common than the wife killed the husband. That's a fucking awful, awful shit man. Real. Yes, he was a file bankruptcy and his house was about to go in foreclosure. Oh butter, kill my wife. It's not only ready to get a job or kids, it's like the thing where people hit that wall where they don't have any other solution and you know, someone will say, oh it's depression. You know it's, yeah, okay, I get it. But how does it make you kill them

Speaker 4:          01:45:54       now? There's no solution and silver. I mean, cause he called nine one one and said it. Oh my God, that's going to be used against them. I mean like, what are you going to do?

Speaker 1:          01:46:05       Who knows, man? It's like, what do you deal with that? I mean, it's like, I'm not married, ma'am. I just seen these guys. He's married guys that are just like, the only way out is to often, it's always the always the husband. So he's just so, you know, it's like so funny because, well, it's not always the husband. I mean it's more often the husband more often. Yeah, like people that I know where the guy in the woman, you know it was, it was Phil Hartman was killed by his wife, wasn't she? Yeah, sure what? Yes he was. Yes, I heard that. Awesome. Heard it all day. All Day. She was on Zoloft and cocaine. And when does she eat an ex escort? I don't know how it goes. I'm sure people have alleged that, but you know, she'd go and fuck a guy for dinner. Basically.

Speaker 1:          01:46:52       You're an escort. A lot of escorts out there. God bless him. You know, there's a lot of girls that go like, go on dates with guys and that and that for a free meal. Why not fucking them. Just because they feel bad. He got went out and bought drinks and dinner. That's real. It does happen. I don't encourage him, but it does happen. You don't need to fuck a guy for dinner. Joey Diaz has a funny joke about that, about the Liberace movie. I don't think he does it anymore, but he uh, he goes, uh, he goes, he goes, if a, if somebody buys you dinner and he goes, you don't have to fuck them. But if you fly a person out somewhere, he was talking about Liberace flying that guy out to Vegas. He goes, you fly outs, someone's getting the Dick sock.

Speaker 1:          01:47:33       Yeah. This is different. This gene, someone visiting you. That's like what people always have an issue with like a girl flying out to hang out with a guy and see the weekend I've had the comics have heard that happened to them. Like they meet a girl on the road. Like, man, I think she's really cool. She's going to come out and visit me. We'll see what's up. And the girl flies out to visit them. And then nothing. I had a buddy who in the hell fluid chick, he met a chick here in La Fluor to Toronto. She took the flight, got to truck, cause she's from Toronto, got there, never called him, never hung out. He kept calling her like, where are you? She like did, no, I can't. I can't hook up right now. She uses them for a plane ticket. Hey, there's unscrupulous people out there. Some of them have vaginas. Yeah. Some of them have penises. Yup. No one's immune. Yup. Some of them are crazy. Comes in all sizes. Some of them are gay, some of them are transgender. There's some fucking shady people out there in all walks of life. What do you think about the word tranny? Transgender and all that stuff. I think of it's okay to call a cab driver. A cabbie. She'd be able to call a transgender a training. It's just an abbreviation.

Speaker 1:          01:48:42       I don't think it's, I believe intent. I think what we were talking about earlier, like when you're talking about what, what is rape? You know, we all know what's bad. When you define something by a name, you know when you say like, Oh, you have a couple of drinks and then you have sex with somebody that's rape, they have sex with you, it's rape because you've had three drinks or we have two drinks. Now it becomes rape. I think defining people like this is this, this guy, oh, he's a fag. Oh, this guy, oh, he's a homo, this guy. Oh, he's gay man. Like what do you, what's in your mind? What's the intent? Yeah. What's your in your mind when you know, if Justin Martin, Dale, we're here and we're like, well, if homeowners like you could stop fucking monkeys, what would we be doing?

Speaker 1:          01:49:23       What would the word intent be? Are we love Justin? It would, our intent would be to make fun and have a good time and with no hate at all. But if we were like sitting here going, well, you know, it's pretty clear in the Bible that the gay will suffer and we say it today, let me say it to him. And like in an evil way, there's nothing wrong with calling someone gay. Right, right. But there's something wrong with saying those words. It's something went wrong with projecting. Where is it coming from? Of course. Do you try? It's like Patrice O'Neal

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       when um, you know, he got on that MSNBC show or whatever the fuck it was. Would that lady lady who was arguing about a opie and Anthony get in trouble for a rape jokes, rape joke or is it a joke about, no, you know what it was was that homeless guy got on the show and the homeless guy w started talking about Condoleezza Rice and he was doing like saying he would rape her and then they got suspended and what Patrice O'Neal was trying to say was that when someone is trying to be funny like that, it's all coming from the same place. It's all coming from a place of trying to be funny. If it's coming from a place where you're trying to hurt someone's feelings or you are discriminating or you are being evil, that's a different thing. It's not the label. It's the intent behind it. And we get all tied up in the words like they were trying to stop bossy for awhile. Were you aware of that? Yeah, they were trying to say that bossy is like the new cont, you know, like calling someone bossy is like

Speaker 4:          01:50:43       they're doing that with, uh, he's a what's a ghetto? But what is the word that like these NFL players we're trying to say gangster or get oh yeah, ghetto is the new n word ghetto when he's acting really ghetto like a, this one guy, uh, what's the, what's Richard Sherman? People really flipped out on him because he was like, went off on this football player in the middle of this, uh, interview after game and he's like, oh, he's all ghetto. He's acting all ghetto. And they were trying to say that's the new way of saying the n word. Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah. And it's just an, he just becomes something new every, you know, everybody wants to get offended by other words and it's just like, listen to the n word and the f word. There's definitely history behind that when you're asked for it. Compared to when you're talking about gay guys, right?

Speaker 4:          01:51:31       There's, there's a history of oppression out there that comes with that work. Whereas some every group wants get their own word, but what about faggotry? I love that word. I can really say why. Okay, listen, you don't like the word faggot. I totally understand that you couldn't eat fat. It's the same thing. I mean, listen, I say everybody can say whatever they want to. Either you like it or you don't and we move on. If you don't like it, you don't like it. Don't watch the comedy. Don't watch the show. Don't buy the product. Move the fuck on.

Speaker 2:          01:52:02       There's two different things that are problem here. Two very different things. There's one, there's the, the thing is people saying actual slurs, having mean intent and being, you know, a an evil person with evil intent. Then there's also another thing going on where people just going after words and the use of words and trying to limit the use of words and try to limit the language that we use, not the intent and not the thought behind the words, not the, the, the philosophy or the way of looking at life, which I think for most of us is constantly evolving and changing from the time we're younger to the time we're older. We learned life lessons along the way. We have fought cops. We, we make mistakes. We'd say things we wish we could take back. We say things all the time and then we see things that we,

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       you know, we realize her. Cool. Well when you had to know six together, you got a lot of different things going on. It's not just about the words themselves. What it's about is people having like good intent and there's a lot of people also, I think that they use these words to inject some serious fucking hate and vitriol out into the world. They use other people using those words to be more hateful than the actual use of the word itself. You know, the more angry like fine, you know, youtube comments where people think they're being social justice warriors going after someone you know who might have a used an incorrect term. Yeah. Or going after someone who says said as disparaging thing about transgender people or whatever the fuck it is, and you're just going to find fucking anger and hate coming from people that are supposedly progressive on a scale that you rarely see even coming from people that are conservative.

Speaker 1:          01:53:46       What I hate about the political correct movement is that how much fine print comes with that word, meaning like they should, they totally accept it and almost in their brains convinced themselves that this person who they approve of uses the word is actually use that word to make fun of those who used the word is negative. They actually convinced themselves of it. There's so much fun about the coal Baer report them. Well, not even though that, yeah, that girl drives me fucking nuts. If you don't know that story, it's a genius story. Cole Bear. Um, [inaudible] smart. Yeah. Well this cancel cold bear was this thing that started, uh, you know, trending online because they thought that Steven Colbert put out a, a racist joke, like pull, pull the video. Probably pull us off of Youtube, but I think it's fair use. Um, we can just do that.

Speaker 1:          01:54:39       Our article about it. Yeah. But the two e two is her neighbor spark suey park and you know, she's, she uses a lot of big words and she uses a lot of progressive lingo. Well she was interviewed by us, somebody on huffing, but let's explain. It's explained that the thing, the punchline was I'm willing to show the Asian community I care by introducing the Ching Chong Ding Dong Foundation for sensitivity to orientals or whatever. And it was meant to be a satirical analog to the Washington Redskins original Americans Foundation, which is hilarious. Yeah. I mean, it's funny. It's so funny when you hear it coming from Kobe. He's making fun of their callous, how safe they are that the people who want to keep the name red skins. So people, some people only saw one part of it. And I think it was a tweet that was a was put out.

Speaker 1:          01:55:33       So cancel cold bear, um, to comedy central actually put out the tweet, the hashtag cancel cold bear became one of Twitter's twinning trending topics across the United States. And it was because this one chick, but it's not just her because whether she was wrong, I mean she might have like saw that and overreacted and didn't understand what was going on. That tire didn't see the whole thing, just saw part of it, started it off and then boom, she was caught up in this wave of interaction. Well I would say I would disagree with that statement that she was caught up in it because she would keep doing interviews about, well after, you know, like a week or so after people are like, you understand it's satire. And then the guy interview on this hub team posting, which was really funny and she's like, I know it's sad. And she gives the, the literal definition of satire, meaning that she basically read what the definition was. She didn't get the joke, well, here's where it gets even better by lunchtime. Deadspin published a post by two Korean American writers with the tongue and cheek headline Guccis don't get redskin joke.

Speaker 1:          01:56:48       So fellow Asian Americans were attacking her and cancel co bear became a joke more than anything. And then not only did it not get canceled, well he got the goddamn tonight show or the late show with David Letterman. He's the new lunch almost makes me wonder if the whole thing was fake. I mean, my hope opinion is that I'm starting to see like these things, these internet outrageous over statements being made by comedians and it almost gets to the point where I sometimes I wonder if they're just fake outrage. Just the drum up publicity behind this. What's being said? No, it's people realize that they can get attention. That's exactly what's going on. They would realize they can get attention or they get attention by pretending to be upset at something. Or what if the people who said the statement people behind them drum up fake outrage.

Speaker 1:          01:57:41       Put out this, pull up this outrage. P O u t outright cash rage a of Suey Park as co bear lands, the late show. There's this guy who does, is a online commentary, uh, picking apart everything from this, this controversy to feminism to everything. I mean he's, he's pretty hilarious. So we palm council coal there, his name is that under phones in Time magazine, Corose promotion of more white male celebrities prove is it the entertainment industry has perfected the development of white cis, straight male characters and the marginalization of other voices except one of those others. A bolt in only to eat in the punchline of a joke.

Speaker 3:          01:58:39       This is a, they're showing people

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       of color being bad ass

Speaker 7:          01:58:46       and women. This is all the voices except one of those others are boarding only to eat in the CIC. Punchline joke is complete. This is aggression. We do not have to accept, we will protect this until it ends of this one to seven, just immediately. Young Asian American women with little institutional power. I'm not supposed to be loud. Our voices are not expected to be ready on believable. Oh, raised. They're not meant to travel. Actually silly. If you all lucky they weren't following that. There's the old saying goes, it's better to remain silent and before to fall the top open one's mouth and remove all doubt

Speaker 8:          01:59:34       and how genocide and slavery in oriental have them all work together to uphold white supremacy. Right. Really kind of the way that I understand as my work, which is why a lot of my work, anything essentially with these mainstream Asian American activist groups,

Speaker 7:          01:59:49       because the simple truth is the young people generally don't hold institutional power because they lack general experience. They'd like life experience. Now I know you left home to go to university for a year or two.

Speaker 8:          02:00:03       My mom just came home.

Speaker 7:          02:00:05       Okay, maybe you went to university for a year or two and now you think you know everything about the world president suing you park. They all shrunk as you with your 23 year old wisdom set about solving of the world's problems and many will have chuckle, a quiet chuckle of mirth. And then I sold as you got whole lot on your own Hubris, only about a week or so after your campaign though, cancel Colbert. It turns out the coal bat was indeed couldn't cancel and instead he's now going to take over the reins from David Letterman on the eminently prestigious leacher. Oh this seems to trigger, these tears are range from you in your latest article. It's not, oh you were till we say it's all the is a taste of unfashionable sorrow. They are. So the white man as you frequently refer to him has now become the beloved white one. Yeah. Because being white must mean that the white man was always reasonable, always pure, always deliberate, always complex and always innocent. So he continues the recent which the game by correcting us dismissing. Yes.

Speaker 2:          02:01:20       No, this is kind of unfair. And this is like a part of the Internet. You know that a young person. Cause if I was 23 and you ask my opinions on virtually anything, you would get something half as intelligent as that. We're all idiots at 23 years old. Well No, just a bit unfair about just the nature of the Internet that

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       someone can just, I agree man. But I just think there's something in this country we're like, and listen, racism does exist. 100% save it for that real rate. This fake out. This girl wants, this girl wants credit for oppression. She never went through. Well, she's got a tension. That's what's going on her. Her Butler, her like her, her brothers are like all doctors and lawyers. I mean like she's, I mean I do joke about her, you know, it's like she's born in like 1991 like talk about the dark years of 98 we'll Usui like what did you go through in 1988 the oppression that you had to go through, like they didn't let you wear your hello kitty backpack to school. Like that's racist. No, it's not. Ranking them on Asians were in hello kitty is, I'll totally okay. Call me racist them right. Shuts my points at least racial.

Speaker 1:          02:02:28       That's my point. What are you going through? I don't think you have a point. I'm going to be honest with you. I do have a point. What was 98 that's the year where you kind of come into consciousness like point is there, was it just the thought of that? She's trying to equate what she's gone through with like what, but I don't think she is. You know what she is? She's getting attention and then she's running with it and I think you know, as much as she might have thought she's thought this stuff out, what's going on? Is she looking at a white belt in life? She's a white belt. She's a young person who's sort of, you know, maybe she's smart, maybe she's not. I don't know. Maybe she's educated. Maybe she's not. I don't really know. It's hard to tell from this because what you have is a bright spotlight on a person who probably shouldn't have had it on them.

Speaker 1:          02:03:11       Yup. Made a big mistake, hit a chord. That chord is the racism cord and hit it, hit it accidentally because didn't understand the satire of have a joke and it didn't understand the context of a tweet that it was a part of a much larger piece. And, and taking that out of context and running with it connected to a system. And once she's a part of that system, once she starts being interviewed and you know, people were calling her a fucking idiot on Fox News. Like I said, I think it was Fox News where someone called her stupid, like he, the guy actually called her stupid. Like I said, you're, you're, what you're saying is so stupid that I can't even, whatever the fuck the guy's statement was. The point was he called her stupid. Like that's when you gotta be pretty fucking bad at relaying a point on the news for someone to call you stupid.

Speaker 1:          02:03:57       Well, I, I just, I mean, I understand that to have 23 it's just, she's a black belt. She's white belt. He's cute though. Yeah. That's my whole thing. Who's been meaning? Who has been more oppressive to hot young Asian girls? Why old white men or like they're Asian parents. A young kid. She's young kid, you know, she's 23 years old. Yeah. She so she was called stupid. Um, by uh, Josh Huffington post lives. Josh Zaps. That was a funny interview in a heated debate. Yeah. It's kind of funny, by the way. She's doing the interview on that one in the background. She has stuffed animals on her bed.

Speaker 2:          02:04:40       Meanwhile, she wrote after that in case anyone thought I was censoring Cole Bear, please know that I was just talked down to muted and silenced by Josh Zips and Huffington Post live. And then Josh Zap tweets to her, uh, the righteousness of professional umbrage takers. Suey Park wasn't muted or silence. I invited her to explain herself and she declined. That's funny.

Speaker 4:          02:05:03       She pulled that whole thing like you can't say that because you're a white guy thing, which is a classic like,

Speaker 2:          02:05:08       well that's a new thing. The new thing. Chicago peeps. I'm going to be doing a comedy show on June 26th. Suey park rights away. Show off the cackle. Oh my God. That's not real. That's real. Yeah. Oh, she's now getting into stand up comedy, which is the store. I like. Jamie Kelsey is going to coach her. It's going to work out well. We'll welcome you with open dicks. Don't open your Dick Up. Things will fall out of there like hey is this is crazy. She's so the guy said to her, he said, it's just a stupid opinion. She argued that satire is supposed to punch up. Oh okay. It's that thing you shouldn't, you shouldn't say anything. Oh please pull that up. Pull that video up. Cause Suey Park and uh, Josh zips

Speaker 4:          02:05:55       basically said that he's pretty much not allowed to comment on it because he's not an Asian man cause he's not Asian

Speaker 2:          02:06:01       and pays with white privilege. Do you know like privilege is a thing that there was a, a recent article that everybody critiqued or criticized it. Some young kid at Yale wrote about being told to check his privilege. You know, this, this whole thing that's check your privilege thing. It's nice. Uh, let's pause that for a second there. It's, it's, it's a nice thing to want people to be kind and considerate is a nice thing. But when you give them a tool, like check your privilege, whenever it involves anything racial, you're going to silence the debate because now someone is being told essentially to shut up because they're white, which is wait for it. Racist. So you're not even allowed to have a point of view if you're the wrong race to talk because your privilege, that racist privilege. So there's like a balancing act going on and the white people are not allowed to even debate ideas. You're supposed to check your privilege and shut up and listen to whatever, whether it's a woman or an Asian or whoever it is other than the white man.

Speaker 4:          02:06:56       I always feel that like really young boys like, uh, like young white boys have to pay for the sins of their fathers and the grandfathers. I live near a high school and I drive by it all the time and I see groups of kids hanging out and they're all multiracial. So the whole experiment that's been done in this country about making everybody integrated has worked to a point. There's a lot of integration in these young kids. It's working and it's getting better and it's got more room to go. But I feel like young white boys sometimes have to pay for the sins of thy fathers and their grandfathers. There's this whole thing in the Mba that people get really mad that the last couple spots on an NBA team tend to be given to guys and there are really upset because you know, it's like well why should they be making that for white kids?

Speaker 4:          02:07:41       Well it's the same thing that they're doing in Hollywood where, uh, you know where the, the TV shows have to have multiracial, multiracial characters. The commercials are multiracial so the young kids see themselves in there and realize they could do that too. It's about reaching everybody. Well as I grew up as a young kid who wanted to play pro basketball, there was a woman, yeah. You know, I wanted to play pro basketball and I wanted to be the first white guy, the plan Georgetown's basketball team. Cause at the time it was all black guys. Right. And I always wanted to be on that cause I want to be the white kids. So I can understand to a point why you have a couple of white guys on the team because a lot of kids who are young, white kids dream of being plain dream of playing pro basketball. So it's the same thing. The thoughts of,

Speaker 2:          02:08:31       of action for white people. Tools point. Yeah. I think that here's the problem with all this white guy stuff. Without a doubt, white people have it

Speaker 4:          02:08:41       Wazier way better way, way, way, way, way complaining it. Yep.

Speaker 2:          02:08:45       All about it makes you look like a fucking idiot because the idea of white privilege, the real idea is that white people have an advantage and they had an advantage culturally and how they're treated by society. I think that's true. I think it's 100% true. It doesn't mean that you should have to check your white privilege when you're talking about ideas cause he cause saying something like that to someone. You're not saying, hey look, white people have an advantage. But realistically that's all unfair and we should all be equal and we should all be one and just let's just go and talk about ideas from an even playing field. I totally agree. But this whole thing of like anybody having an issue on something, but then again, imagine if you were going to school and you are a black guys experienced a lot of oppression, some rich white twat was giving you some dude who just like, you know, grew up with rich parents on the fucking Hamptons and he's giving you a hard time and he doesn't understand that he got a fucking easy run.

Speaker 2:          02:09:34       The sperm. Yeah. So you would want to say check your privilege to him. I checked. I get that too. I get it when it's appropriate to let everyone know, like, look dude, you got lucky. You, you, you fucking, you found five aces. That's what it is. You were, you were born on third base. He didn't hit a triple. Okay, you're right there. I got lucky as fuck. And that's a lot of people and that's annoying to folks. But the idea that a white person can't have an opinion about satire because he's white and he doesn't understand what it's like to be an Asian woman who didn't get the joke. Holy Shit, that's dumb. I agree. But that's the PR. The problem is she's 23, she's 23 years old. She's, you know, a young person with ideas that maybe aren't completely formed yet thrust into this weird position to defend something that was a mistake.

Speaker 4:          02:10:18       I've always said that, uh, you know how the Israel, Israel, you have to serve in the army. I've always felt that people in America after they graduate high school, high school, they should all have to wait tables at Denny's.

Speaker 2:          02:10:28       Dude, I'll tell you this man, people aren't canceling core bear up and fucking Edmonton. Okay? They're beaten seals to keep

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       their fire warm. They're fucking, it's cold as shit up there. It's a different world. If you have this really fucking easy life, you start finding shit to bitch about and you start finding shit when you have his Internet connection, you have the ability to get a bunch of other knuckleheads involved. You start bitching about shit and you find that there's a bunch of people that it resonates with and then you're caught up in a wave, you caught up in a wave of attention and you see it all the time. A lot of these people that are the so called social justice warriors, they're aggressively asshole ish. Oh. I also think there's a lot of it that there's a lot of personal. They're trying to make a dollar off. They're like the Susie chew now she's going to go out there and you should choose. So what park wood over him is more racism.

Speaker 1:          02:11:15       I'm first, it was hello kitty now as soon as you chew. So she's gonna go out there. She going to do stand up. She's probably going to write a book. She's going to be making an appearance. It's only eight and four. Let her make the money. But my point is how much of it is pure B B behind actual wanting change and how much is it just to make a buck off it? Well, I don't know, but let's listen to this video because it's quite fascinating. I liked it. This a Joshua's apps video weeding. Suey Park. No, don't do that asshole. What are you doing man? Don't do that. I was going to ask her if she want to do podcasts. Dude, don't do that.

Speaker 9:          02:11:46       Oh God. Uh, cancel Cole Bear. That's what some Twitter users are demanding after the call. Bear rapport. Put out an album now deleted tweet reading. I'm willing to show Asian community. I care by introducing the Ching Chong Dingdong Foundation for sensitivity to orientals or whatever they're set off a Twitter firestorm late Thursday night with people sounding off. Hashtag cancel call back cause we really don't need another white liberal celebrity trying to justify racism using satire that ironically ridiculous Asians is not productive for indigenous or nor any marginalized group. White humor blows. Hashtag cancel call bear. Why and the willows via suey park white people. Please keep a hashtag cancel Colby or trending until there's an apology. This is not the burden of people of color. Fix it. Do something. Joining us now is the author of that very same tweet. So we park and also still with us is huffpost politics reporter Jason Lincoln's. Thanks for being with us. Sui acquire. Thanks for having me. Why cancel Cole Bear? What did you hope to achieve with that?

Speaker 8:          02:12:45       Well, that's a loaded question. I think it's sad, but unfortunately a lot of times our demands aren't really met unless we have really serious asks, are we generating these larger conversations? Um, unfortunately people usually don't listen to us when we're being reasonable. So, um, I think it's really to make a statement that this sort of thing happens weekly, that I'm Asian Americans are always a punchline. Um, and so I think we're just trying to make a point that people will be held accountable the next time they do these studies.

Speaker 9:          02:13:10       So just to clarify the context, the tweet was related to a segment that was lampooning Dan Snyder, who is the owner of a certain Washington DC football team that has a racist name. It was meant to be, it was meant to be satire. I mean, do you understand the point of satire that you say something that's intentionally absurd in order to ridicule or not the people who are the target of what you're saying, but the pit, but other people who might say it

Speaker 8:          02:13:30       of I understand satire.

Speaker 9:          02:13:32       I'm a writer. I think that tire caters to the audience that you're speaking to you. So it says something about what the audience finds humorous or acceptable when you're using this sort of jokes. And I think that Tyra's supposed to punch up. Um, so unfortunately he's not doing that when he draws a parallel to orientalism to make a point about a native American mascot, but isn't his point that there are lots of stupid racist people who isn't even in their attempt to be conciliatory on race, end up putting their foot in it and saying something dumb.

Speaker 8:          02:13:59       I really don't think that we're going to end racism by joking about it. Like I'm glad that the white liberal, it feel like they are less rates. That's because they can joke about people that are more explicitly racist, but that actually does nothing to help people of color. Why? Why attack us?

Speaker 9:          02:14:11       Tickle, attack on dance, not as racism instead of just attacking dance night as racism.

Speaker 8:          02:14:16       Uh, well if you're familiar with my activism where my work, I've been very vocal about a native American mascot. So I went to the University of Illinois for my undergraduate career and when we had [inaudible] and I was incredibly vocal about it and I had the same sort of backlash, um, and that kind of backlash happens no matter what you're really attacking, whether it be, um, you know, the word oriental being used as a slur, um, yellow face jokes against Asian American people or if I'm really just talking about native American mascots and Dan Snyder, um, I know I helped trend, I'm not your mascot. Um, on Superbowl night. Um, if I, you know, the name red skins and not your Tonto. And I had the same sort of backlash though. It really isn't fair to kind of individualize these things and ask why I'm not shifting my behavior. Because honestly, if white liberals cared about really getting rid of the mascot, there's a lot they can do to help organize or get involved besides caring about their joke. So for them, it's not really about whether or not, um, the Redskins exists or whether or not racism is over. It's really about them feeling like they can't have fun anymore. I'm feeling entitled to be able to laugh at things that aren't really funny.

Speaker 9:          02:15:15       Jason, a part of the whole, the whole gag here is the use of the term orientalism, which is such a weird old loaded, like it's just, it, it's a stupid, stupid, a word that the butt to get upset about that, about the use of that word when it's in a satirical context strikes me as misguided. I want to take a look though at a tweet which a cold bear rapport has a, has tweeted out, says for the record,

Speaker 8:          02:15:34       bear rapport is not the white man. You know,

Speaker 9:          02:15:37       hang on till we all come to you in just a sec. Uh, for the record, cold bear rapport is not controlled by Stephen Colbert. All his show. He is at Steven at home. Sorry for the confusion. I, Kobe himself has responded to some of the criticism on Twitter. Hashtag cancel Kobe. I agree. Just saw at Colby report tweet. I share your rage. Who is that though? I'm Steven at home. Uh, so you were just going to jump in.

Speaker 8:          02:15:57       Uh, yeah, I was gonna say that. I feel like it's incredibly patronizing for you to paint these questions this way, especially as a white man. I don't expect you to be able to understand what people of color are actually same with regards to cancel. Call there

Speaker 9:          02:16:11       being a white man doesn't give him, it doesn't prevent me from being able to think and doesn't prevent me from being able to have, uh, have thought reason, perspectives on things I don't, I didn't give up. I didn't give up my right to be able to have an intellectual conversation.

Speaker 8:          02:16:23       I know, but oh well. White men definitely feel like they are entitled to talk over me. They definitely feel like they're entitled to kind of minimalize experiences and they definitely feel like they are somehow exempt and so logical compared to them women who are painted as a personnel, right?

Speaker 9:          02:16:35       Oh No, no one's minimalizing your your experiences. No one's minimalizing your right to have an opinion. It's just a stupid opinion. I mean it's, it's a misunderstanding of what,

Speaker 8:          02:16:46       yes, you just called my opinion stupid. That's incredibly unproductive and I don't think I'm going to enact the labor. I've had any to explain to you why that's incredibly offensive and patronizing.

Speaker 1:          02:16:57       Explain. I just told you that when the neck, that Labor, okay. Thanks for being with us. Sui Looking. It's unfair. That's a black belt versus a white belt. That's what it is. I mean even if she had a point, you know, in some way, shape or form, that's sort of wrapped up in all this fucking craziness. Even if she had a point, it's just what if, what if she's complaining? Like to me it's, it's so interesting cause some of the most damaging Asian racial material is done by Asian comedians. Like what's your take on that? Well they do. Why do they do it though? They do it because it works like why they do it. They do it to break the ice like why they got fat, guys tell fat jokes so that you can't, right? Because if you go on stage, you're a fat fuck and your entire act is just about all. She's called me fat. Fuck Bro. I said if you know, if you're a guy and you're, you're a giant guy, you better talk about that on stage. I agree. Because if you don't and the audience is going to fucking pointed out what is this. Okay. She talks back and forth. Oh and best buddies course Jamie Kilstein. Oh my God, it's so bastard. Just a show cause is all a simulation theory. I was choking when I say that he would help her with her comedy. Oh my God. It probably helped her with her comedy.

Speaker 1:          02:18:21       He means, well I swear to God he does. I just can't. I just, it's like it's great to males. So much fine print. It's bad to be a guide. Don't you know men are men getting all these women pregnant. Doing all the raping, building, all the roads. Unbelieving are assholes. It's a mess. The whole thing is, gosh, it's, it's especially in this country where, I mean like everything I know is not perfect, Bam, but when you hear what goes on in other countries by that it's, it's just so big that don't buy that. This is why I don't buy that. People always say that, but we know that it could be better. So yeah, it's better than what it is. Another kind of agree with Dell, it's, it's a crazy thing to say with all the information awareness we have the least important thing to concentrate on is how much better it is here.

Speaker 1:          02:19:06       Right? Yeah. About dwelling on like patting ourselves on the back for making this country better than the other. Not saying that, but that's what everybody does and not saying that, but she is sitting there and taking a joke and just making it into this giant global issue or she's trying to do it when we have a situation in China where they chuck girls when they were like, man, I don't expect you to understand chucking girls China as a white man. I think it's incredibly condescending and patronizing. Use the network to we pack. Can I open?

Speaker 1:          02:19:37       I would love to you a man will do it for laid down in Edmonton. By the way, Sam Shipley's new CD available to believe in yourself. Believe in yourself. You thank you in there and you please Bro. The set that you laid down when we were working together in Edmonton, you [inaudible] did, did it. It was a lot of fun and that was right before you filmed it. Right. And we're recording it rather, and it was really worked up because a bunch of people that we came to the commissary and said they'd saw me at your show in Edmonton. Yeah, we totally worked out ways. Yeah, we were at the river Cree and then Sam was there like how long later? Like literally the next week. Perfect. It was awesome. Yeah, and then they came down to support. That's awesome because that was a fun set dude. But you were only doing, he did a half an hour at my show.

Speaker 1:          02:20:18       How long has the CD, you have a lobbyist? Almost an hour. So even if they did come to see it, they still got a bunch of shit that they didn't. The fucking rob Ford stuff was funny. Is that on this? That's funny shit man. Get it on there before it's old school. Fucking caught him again since then. They caught him again. He's at the comedy store. He showed up with a store and Brian didn't even pictures of him. Did you get pictures of him that no, I was out of town, but everyone, yeah. I'm like, why don't we just open the bar and see what we can get into? If we were back there, if that was like during the days when I was hanging out at the comic store, we would have the greatest video of all time and he talking to rob Ford. I would have got him shot.

Speaker 1:          02:20:54       Sweat standings are bringing shots to open, open, open bar, have fun. I wouldn't call Uber in advance knowing those going to be too drunk to drive. I would have just fucking threw my keys in a in a condom, swallowed them, lock my car and just start hitting it hard. Oh, I would love to all the crazy cocaine running around that place swallowed my keys like a fucking drug mule. I was so jealous watching everyone's Twitter feed because if you're in La Jolla and I was like, the one time I'm not at the comedy story. That's hilarious man. Have you heard about Drug Carmichael? Rogan? What? This kid named Gerard Carmichael, the nicest kid. That kid right there, he just shut his first standup special was a one hour HBO special directed by Spike Lee in the o are at the comedy store. Yeah. You know who told me that was the nicest kid in Edwards told me he was doing that there.

Speaker 1:          02:21:53       Dude could not, I mean really dude. Yeah. Ian Actually came over to the ice house after we had done it. He did it like on a Wednesday night, right? Yeah, I did on some crazy nightmare. Yeah. It was a Wednesday night cause Ian went to see and then he came down to the comedy store afterwards. Such a nice kid, but that's legendary dude. That is legendary. Ever stand up on television is a one hours. It's pretty bad in the most, the most sacred of rooms. I mean the ors crazy. How many specials have ever been done in the or? I think that's the first, well maybe they're smart and opening that place up to specials. They're getting internet. Oh that's right. Oh well I don't want them to show soon. I going to see what's there. We're getting nutty. Why are they doing that? That's the dangerous dolch.

Speaker 1:          02:22:36       I don't want them showing our live sets. You've got to work on stuff. That's why there was a, with the laugh factory was doing that for awhile. There's a comedy club, and I don't want to say the name, but they were, they were, if you signed the agreement, the play there, they record your set. And I'm like, I don't want your record my set because I'm coming here to work out material that's fucked. That's fucked. Yeah. That's not good. You know, I think people that run clubs, you know, they're just trying to get asses in the seats, try to get people excited about the colony. And if you don't do the, the process of creating it yourself, you don't know how vital that is unless you're really paying attention. A lot of club owners do know, but some of them just think, hey, you know, we're getting people to look, or you got 100,000 views on youtube channel, you know, Sham, triple.

Speaker 1:          02:23:19       He just worked right. New materials that hard. We're giving you have a great place to perform. She should be happy to perform here. But that was the thing about some clubs, especially like the Hollywood clubs where they have this odd, this attitude that like working there was supposed to be prestigious, that the club itself was like the star. Like um, you're a box with a microphone. Yes. Right. It's the comedians that have performed here that are legendary. It's not this box with a microphone cause they could've gone next door to the fucking Hyatt. They could have built a box there. I'll do, we'd have to do is say, Hey, you know what? I'm not performing here anymore. I'm going to build a box next door at the Hyatt. Let's pack that bitch. And you know, if Kennis he never wanted to do that or let them in.

Speaker 1:          02:23:58       Everyone or any of those guys that made the comedy store famous, ever wanted to perform next door, they could have done that. I thought after a wild Sam Kennison started just doing rock clubs, he didn't. I'm like sunset. Well he did a lot of that. But you know, he's the best example. I've talked about it before about a guy who was really good and became a really bad in a short period of time from making it, just making it just the, the, the, the fucking overwhelming pressure of being famous and being huge at one point in time. Fuck, I just fell apart. I shrugged. She think had something to do with it. Fuck yeah. Dude. Boobs and it drugging it. His brother talked about in his book. Really fascinating brother Sam. Have you read it? Yeah, yeah. It's good man. It's really good. Get it. It's great.

Speaker 1:          02:24:42       But I'll read it out of print, but you can get it off and go to your house and steal it. Don't do, don't steal. Sam, what kind of a message that I say send to the, especially the Asians steel. Do you see that? A video? Elisabeth Hasselbeck was talking to some guy who was a former NFL players. Now a lawyer, really smart guy. And they were talking about marijuana and uh, you know, she was, it was on Fox News and Elisabeth Hasselbeck, they're really conservative, hot, blonde chick. The view, she found her rightly place in the universe. She must be so excited. She's one of the hot blondes on Fox News. She was like a reality show. What was it like as survivors? Yes, it was on survivor and then she got on the view and then a pop popup. How and now she's a, now she's Fox News where she belonged.

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       She is happy to be there just spreading sate and seed. And she was talking to this guy who's a former football player and they were talking about weed and the guy made an excellent point. You just said, isn't it going to send the wrong message to the children? He was like, if the NFL today decided to ban alcohol use for all of its players, it wouldn't affect teen alcohol use at all. And she was just like earth. Yeah, that's her. That's her face. That's the face that she had. He was like, there's worst things to worry about. We're gonna have to play it. I don't, I didn't want to play it. So fucking dumb. Those conversations are so brutal too. When you, uh, when you have long form conversations like on a podcast and like say all the things we were talking about, whether it's we're talking about the cancel called bear thing or racism or privilege.

Speaker 1:          02:26:10       These are like long discussions. They're long debates where if you're, if you're going to really get to the heart of something and find out a person's real opinions on something you, it's a very subtle and nuanced sort of a thing. There's, you need to really be able to talk for long periods of time. There's nothing wrong with that, but when you're doing that on a show like a Fox News show, you have three minutes. This conversation with this football player was three and a half minutes long. Football player turned lawyer three and a half minutes and then at the end they're like, okay, well thank you for your time. We appreciate it. Bye. We're done covering this subject. We're going to discuss a gay military people and fucking what about gay marriage? And they're wearing cammo now what do we do? We take camelback believable. It is unbelievable what it's, it's that form of entertainment, that form of communication, that form of entertainment.

Speaker 1:          02:26:58       Let's call it entertainment cause that's really what it is. It's, it is not just unsuitable. It's not adequate for complex topics. It's not, it's not adequate. When you discuss the subject of marijuana and teenagers, if you discussing it like that and discuss the subject of the NFL, telling players that they can't or can use marijuana and whether or not you support that, what you're supporting, if you support that, they can. They can tell players they can't use it. You're supporting people having control over their employees. You're not, it's no one, they're gone from work. Exactly. Exactly. You're not even talking about something that they're like in showing up at work drunk. You can't play football drunk and you probably can't play at high. Maybe you can. I think fastball plus dealers do. They love it. They love it of how big the moment is. Do you know what I'm, they're not really thinking.

Speaker 1:          02:27:49       They're more like just in the moment of playing basketball. Then realizing, oh, this might be game seven of this playoff game. Do you know what I'm saying? To a point, you don't like the smoke the weed that much, but when when you're, when you smoke the weed and you do things, whether it's Jujitsu or playing pool, those are the two things I could speak of. You play better. It's enhancing drug. Yeah. You have a more, you have more sensitivity, you feel things better. You, you, you've, you literally, you're tuned into like whatever the fuck it is. Better tune into distance better. He tuned into the rotations, have a ball. You tuned into the way a person moves. Like when you do Jujitsu and you're high, you can feel things better. You feel that sounds okay. You can feel movement better. You feel balanced and shifting better.

Speaker 4:          02:28:32       I, the only time we ever perform high is when I go to the underground cafe. I'm doing it in June. Like the Toronto. Yeah, the 12th through the 14th and it's like, I don't have a say in it. As soon as I hit the stage, by the time my foot presses down on that, I am gone. And it's just, it's very interesting because once your, Wayne, why you don't have a say in it because the room is, well basically it's this, uh, we'd bar that has a comedy club in it and it's so much fun to do. So they have a standup show, but usually before the standup shows, sometimes there's like an improv troupe or there's an open mic, which it can be like two hours long. So people are a hot box and in there. And then everybody smoked weed all the whole time before the show.

Speaker 4:          02:29:17       The stamp show even starts and then the standup show starts and there's usually like two or three people go on before the headliner and everybody's just hotboxing smoking weed, smoking weed. So when you walk out, you're just walking into this just this room of fucking weed smoke and it looks like gorillas in the mist. Like you just see black objects moving in the, in the background under this, like this cloud of smoke and, but by the time my foot hits the stage, I am gone. I can tell you I'm high just from breathing in a second, just breathing in and I've stopped going. Okay, I'm so high now. I just accept it and just start riffing. Hinchcliffe had a green out there where he actually had to take off his shirt and it's so unlike him that he had to go like sit outside on the sidewalk was after he was trying to rustle up some boys that nice gay, super twink tweak, shining super tank,

Speaker 1:          02:30:09       put on an extra show. Sometimes people that want attention, they want it all the time, not just onstage, offstage as well. I took my shirt off. I'm so hot.

Speaker 4:          02:30:19       Anger. Mm.

Speaker 1:          02:30:22       So hot outside. Yeah. He's a, he's a, he's a flirt. That's what he's doing. He's not even gay gay flair. He just knows what he's got. He knows what he's got. He's like a hot chick who's married and she likes to wear short skirts and walked past the bar and know that every guy is like, Ooh God. She not even trying to cheat. She's trying. She just likes the attention. Yeah. Just trying to like likes the head turns. Get the party started. Let's get people excited. Let, let it, let her, you know, let her know she's still rocking it. Keep on rocking in the free world. So we parked suey park. I don't have anything against that girl. By the way, if she ever listens to this much love to you kid, I'll take her out. Brian will take you out. I don't think that's a good thing and will help him cause I don't think that helps anybody. But maybe Brian, I don't even think it helps him. Um, it doesn't help anybody, but he's just saying that if you were into it, you know you can hang out with them. Yeah. I just, I don't like anybody who puts restrictions on comedians and what they can say. There's this whole thing with

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       Leslie Jones too. She got Leslie Jones, she's a comedy store comedian one. It's just one of those people where it's like, that's why every time you follow her at the store to education, you just learn, man. You gotta go up there and focus. And she did some on Saturday night live where she did an old bit that she's been doing together about how she would have been a first round draft pick in slave days cause she would put out great slaves and she did it on there and internet explodes. She'd gets out of her bunch of people did, including other comedians, which I really hate, man. I need to wait and wait and wait and wait and wait a minute. She said she'd be a first round draft pick. If these is, she's a slave girl. Yeah. She's a big tall, thick chick. Why would constantly love to ask you for Dick, why would that be controversial?

Speaker 4:          02:32:09       That's funny because well the whole thing was at that one chick up, uh, prettiest person in the world. It was the girl from 12 years a slave. Right. She on she it, that's kind of where it started from. Like what draft pick she would have been and how Leslie would have been a first round draft pick. Right. Cause she could put out strong stock. You know, you talk about that on stage wanting to fuck a gladiator check. Yeah. I wanted to make some fun like John Jones, his mom, I don't want to get in trouble, but you know, you know just the whole thing about know how amazing that one. Oh Mr all love for my oak. It's all my luck. He's just saying theoretically in the joke universe. Well she put out three super top and super athletes. That's the amazing woman. That's the point of the joke.

Speaker 4:          02:32:55       And he had nothing to do with slavery. Has to do with how amazing she is and well that's, that's what Leslie can you pull up? Leslie Jones is ran on a, she did it on weekend update. You know how the whole thing was that you know, so and I like didn't have enough diversity, especially when it came to, she was my mentor. I live, she's on sending her life. She did us a little monologue on weekend update and people flipped out. Oh okay. I'm so fucking confused. Cause you were saying it was a part of her comedy special, but no, no. It's a part of her standup act and she did as a monologue on Saturday night live. Why don't you do that? Because it was weekend update and they would put to the, she probably pitched it as a little thing for that girl getting, pulling it up.

Speaker 4:          02:33:40       Well, yeah, I think we'd like, you know, if we're smart, we should hear both versions. We should hear the, the special version and the version that she did on, let's hear the fucking version she did on comedy central. Fuck the Saturday night live version. But I think the Senate I live versions, the one that got in trouble. Yeah, but it's the same thing, right? Is it on her special? I just seen her do it at the comedy store a thousand times. I think he only did it at the comedy store. I don't think that was on, I couldn't imagine someone would really get upset about that. Oh yeah. I mean, you just hear comics laying into her and I'm just like, what do what fucking comic who? Ah, don't say Jamie Kelsey. I actually

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       tweeted the comic that did it and he, he wrote me back saying that he took down all of his posts about it and he retracted everything about it. Oh, cool. So what the fuck happened, man? What was it all about? Uh, oh, Shang I know Shang. Yeah, he did it. Yeah. Oh, oh, got a little crazy. Maybe he was drunk. Yeah, I mean you took it down. So, yeah. Well, I don't know who we're attracted it. Well, I just, I just think you should, I, I don't understand that the thought of restricting what people can say you were, it's reward and punishment. If you like what he says, you reward him by going to his shows, buying a CD. If you don't like it, you don't go to his shows. You don't buy cds. I disagree because I think that if someone is saying something evil and hurtful, that there's nothing wrong with going after that and all, nothing wrong with pointing out that something is evil or hurtful. Right. But when something is just a joke about themselves and their own body and their own race in their own origins, I mean, and the idea that this is good. I play it.

Speaker 3:          02:35:22       Thank you very much.

Speaker 10:         02:35:24       Hello everybody. Uh, I wanted to come out here tonight and congratulate the Peter on winning people's most beautiful person. And I agreed that she is very beautiful. But for me personally, I'm waiting for them to put out the most useful list. You know what I'm saying? Cause that's where I'm going. Shot most useful. That's what I said. You delectable Caucasian asking for Dick. By the way, let me ask you a question. If you walked into a club and you saw me and lapita standing at the bar, who would you pick? Wow. Yeah, I know you would pick lapita. Wow. Well let me ask you this. If he was in the parking lot,

Speaker 3:          02:36:05       three

Speaker 10:         02:36:06       crips is about to whoop yo ass. Who Do you going to pick? I would pick you. You're damn right.

Speaker 3:          02:36:13       Sure.

Speaker 10:         02:36:17       And that's my point. The way we view black beauty has changed. Look at me. See, see, I'm single right now. But back in the sleigh days, I would have never been single six feet tall and I'm strong Kotlin Straub. I may look at me, I'm a Mandingo saying you'd rather be a slave. No, that is not what I'm saying. I do not want to be a slave. Hell, I don't like working for you. White people right now. Y'All pay me. I'm just saying that back in the slave days, my love life would have been way better. Master would hook me up with the best brother owned the plantation and every nine months I'll be in the corner having a super baby. Every night I'd just be in a corner just popping them out just up.

Speaker 3:          02:37:06       No Bra. Both slaps. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying

Speaker 10:         02:37:18       the number one slave draft pick.

Speaker 3:          02:37:22       Okay.

Speaker 10:         02:37:24       Plantations move on me. I'll be on television like Lebron announcing which planes. I like to take my talents to South Carolina. I do believe that there's going to be a lot of opportunities there for me. Now. I can't even get a brother to take me out for a cheap dinner. I mean damn 10 a bitch get a beef bar.

Speaker 3:          02:37:52       It's weird that she had to do that.

Speaker 4:          02:37:54       It's weird shit to do it like that. Like using him as I go, like Oh, got a banter back and forth to make it look like it wasn't a bit fucking hilarious. So it was funny. I bet it's even better on stage though. She's uh, she's dude, we call like a, we call their education man. You got her to education cause you got to learn to survive. She sweat. Oh she loves the sweat and Hog. Yeah. Yeah. And then she used to corner me in the back during the Dublin's days and just beg for Dick. It was so great. How long ago was this? Back in Dublin's Day. You remember that girl? Was this, what year was that? Dublin's was like 2006 was it 2000 so yeah, I'd say 2003 or four. Three or four. Yeah. It was the early days. Well Dublin's changed. You know, Dublin's was like a spot where it's like a very few people were going and then it became like a Dane Cook spot for awhile.

Speaker 4:          02:38:41       Yeah. While the Fryer I sit the first year or two it was great because you know Jay Davis and Ahmed Ahmed, it brought in this pretty insane crowd and like you know people, you would go up there and you find out how good comedian you were and if he did really well there were widespread and then there's a thing where I'm not going on after him and you've got to put me on beforehand and people started controlling the lineup, sort of become a prima Donna and doing an hour in the middle of the show and stealing people's material, sitting in the back watching and saying that they were going to get their lawyers on you if you kept doing the bit that happened to me. And that happened to you Dane Cook, that's crazy. Sam Aaa. What happened? What was the bit, I did a bit about the time. I was a big tool fan at the time.

Speaker 4:          02:39:28       And I did and I still am, but I did a bit about when I got pulled over by the cops and they wrote me a ticket for like two 50 for speeding. And he handed to me and I said thank you. And I remember how stupid that was to say thank you for this fucking ticket. And I at the time I'm like, that's like saying thank you after get prison rape. And I used the line, I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive. Thank you. Which is a, a lyric from a tool song. And they did on stage cause I was showcasing for Jamie and I, Jamie made me this thing showcase regular where I would always just get to showcase. And then I just became a regular really quick and I was going to do a showcase and Jamie didn't show up. So I'm like, I'm just gonna do my regular set, you know? And so I go up and I started doing my act and I do that joke where I'm like, I, you know, I basically did the joke and I got, I got huge laughs and I'm leaving there. And, uh, all these comics who were my friends were hanging out in the laugh factory lobby and it was like Butch Bradley and a couple of other people and Dane was there. And I didn't really know Dane by new of Dane. So I'm leaving with my, with Scott Ross.

Speaker 1:          02:40:29       Time is a picture of him shirtless.

Speaker 4:          02:40:33       So I, uh, I do the, I, you know what I'm saying goodbye to everyone. And I'm with Scott Ross, who was my roommate at the time, and I say goodbye to everybody and I saw Dan and go, Hey Dane, thank you Mike. Hey Dan, I'll see you later. And he goes, Yep.

Speaker 1:          02:40:45       Oh, by the way, you're doing my bit in front of everybody and I go, what? And all of a sudden, armo rage just starts coming through me. Armo rage and range. Yeah, just that arm RMO rage. And this is his latest Instagram. He's got his shirt off and bedrooms sucking the stomach into the point where he's probably losing circulation. He mean that is read the caption. Does it say, oh, well that's a caption and a half. Read the caption. Thank you too. Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:41:19       Ah, all my fans and friends over my career. I'm starting a new film next week, writing, then my next one and prepping a lot for a press tours and interviews over the next couple of months for planes to a huge surprise and a huge and a huge surprise. I'm in the best place in my life. I love the people around me. I have let go over my past and that held me and I've embraced a future that is whatever I want it to be. I've worked with wonderful charity organizations over the years and I'm grateful to have always given back and being mindful that the future success depends on how I can create for others now. Oh

Speaker 1:          02:41:57       hmm. How and sign hardware. The more pound signs by the way, you have after you fucking statements to more. I think you're an idiot. I'm just going to let you know more. The more time you Hashtag yeah fucking you have more than three hashtags. I can't really talk to you unless they're really funny. Yeah. And the last one of them says one thing, one of them says not really. And in the next one says something even funnier. Other than that, if you have a fuck fuck five or six motivational hashtags like what he needs a hug man. I mean maybe it's trying to be ironic or funny Plone what's, what's that Hashtag lets stop shitting on Dane here. Jay Did you have an aging? He's a, you know it's, it's interesting guys that were all like in this great place at one point in time and then everything is kind of like kicked out from under them, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:42:41       And with Dane, like the allegations of plagiarism, the, the Louis CK thing, it was very similar in a lot of ways to the Carlos men see it thing. It's just, well I think men see us worse because he found out that people found out it was a Mexican. That's th that's why it's, he lost that whole group. That was devastating. You know, it's all a lot. That's what people, Hey, I mean, you'll always, no matter what, you'll always have a core group of fans that no matter what people say with you about you, they're going to stick with you. But Dane Cook thing was so crazy that people were sending it to me. Like people were like, like laughing, let's not go through all his fucking Instagram, but peep that people were sending it to me going, what the fuck is this? It's interesting. I don't know. Well, I mean, he's trying to pump himself up. He's getting excited about things, trying to be positive. I get all that. I know he went through a really dark time, so that's kind of suck. Why? Why, why he's standing there with your stomach sucked in like that, looking all sexy

Speaker 4:          02:43:36       because maybe that's his cry. I don't know, man. It's just like,

Speaker 1:          02:43:39       you should do that. You, you know what you should do. You should do like the same thing that, um, that uh, Steevo did with Angelina Jolie where all the tattoos that she gets, he gets this, you should do the same thing with all Dane. Cook's tweets, Elvis, and every time he does an Instagram, you should do an Instagram in the exact same pose with the exact same

Speaker 4:          02:44:00       caption. Hope my tits hanging out. I mean considering what you just told us, you know that whole thing. Oh that was long. I know, I know, I know. But it would be fun for a week project for one, for one week. Every time I do the same work thing, he does just the same words, same everything.

Speaker 1:          02:44:18       Poor bastard. He ain't a bad guy. Did you, did you think he had a hard life?

Speaker 5:          02:44:22       Do you see that fight that as Seth Rogan's doing with Macklemore right now,

Speaker 4:          02:44:25       now it's Macklemore. I thought it was fine with Macklemore. Did that kind of, he put on a costume and a lot of people say it was a antisemetic cause it's like it is. Oh yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:44:36       I saw that. He said, hey that it sort of just a random costume that a wig and a fake nose is just a random costume. It looks Hasidic.

Speaker 5:          02:44:44       Yeah, look at that. I mean that's ridiculous that if he's even saying,

Speaker 1:          02:44:48       let me see the, the photo. The image. Hold on. I gotta get it fixed. Macklemore's the one who did it. That's it right there at the grammys. Who's the guy who's mad at him?

Speaker 5:          02:44:59       I think that's just Randy from American idol or something. But yeah, that's, I mean he says it's just a random witches nose and a wig and something like that. I'm like, yeah. What are you trying to make? What else are you supposed to be right now?

Speaker 1:          02:45:10       Okay, so what is a Seth Rogen say first you tricked people into pretending you're a rapper. Now you tricked them into thinking you're Jewish.

Speaker 5:          02:45:16       Yeah. If you go to is Seth Rogan's a thing? He's, he's going back and forth with them all day. Like, cause Macklemore's said, uh, a fake, which is knows wig and a beard equals random costume. Not my idea of a stereotype of any, anyone and then any, any anybody's. And then Seth Rogan guys, Mac more really, because if I told somebody to put together an antisemitic geo costume, they, they have the exact same shopping list and you know, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:45:41       Okay. But here's my question. Why is it antisemetic cause he's got a big note. So what? What if you did one, it was an Italian guy and he had a wife beater on one spaghetti stains on and a lot of gold chains and he went on stage. Maybe there's some fucking morons and the Italian American anti-defamation. They were playing about it. But you're telling me that people don't exist. It looked like that. They do. That's why for me, who's predominantly Italian wouldn't have a problem with someone to be on stage with a wife beater on and gold chains with pizza stains it. I mean you could, you could make a stereotypical Italian outfit and no one care. Why. If you made an outfit that makes you look like an acidic chew, why is that Anti Hasidic Jew? If you can tell that that looks like a Jew, why is that?

Speaker 1:          02:46:23       Antisemetic because Jews are sensitive, but right. I mean, you know what I'm saying? I mean, look, we're not talking about blackface here. Black face has a history of the Minstrel, you know? Well juice would say there was a, you know, there was a lot anti Hebrew propaganda. It was there in Germany that lead to the expression as well, a third of their population. There was but, but is that what that is? Cause the, did they dress up? You know what I'm saying? Like I think it goes back minstrel shows. It was tent, right? I don't think Macklemore who had gay marriage on his grammy song while he did a grammy song is going to be antisemitic. I Dunno, maybe I'm wrong, but I don't, I don't feel that. But people are like, there's a lot of sense. They're not all Ari where they can joke about it all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:47:07       Like something we're very sensitive about that. It's too sensitive, I think in that situation. I just think, look, if you dressed up like a Hasidic Jew, all right. Say if you went on stage. Okay. What's a, the rapper's name? Bad ass rapper. Eminem. No, it guy. Oh, ah, yeah. My motto, Ciu. What did I say it again? [inaudible] that guy. Montas Yahoo. Modest yacht. Fuck you man. Say it right. How dare you rude. Um, I don't even know what it was five seconds ago, pretending I'm offended. Um, Matisyahu uh, if you went on stage dressed up like him, is that antisemetic? That's, if that's how he dresses and you dressed up like him. If you said it was him, like he was just being a Jew. Right? But what was you saying? These not just being Macklemore. Was He in wearing that costume? Was he like doing an offensive Jewish accent or was he doing the same act or was he just being silly?

Speaker 1:          02:48:05       If I can find video of it, I just don't understand why looking someone has to be looking like someone or a parody of someone has to be anti. And I use my own nationality, but I guess Italians there. So let me ask you into being Italian, that they're not really marginalized by their, uh, well, there were people like, I had a cousin, my cousin who's Italian, he apologized. He fucking caved. Yup. You never apologize. Macklemore issues, apology for antisemetic chew costume as Seth Rogan heads out on Twitter. Seth Rogan wins again. That's why we went again. What does that, that was, that's my Seth Rogen from Yoda. You fuckhead riced just stop talking. Well, you know, it's like a lot of Italians. Hey, the soprano. So I'm like, dude, it's not that bad. It's, it's the, it's the mob. It's not like he, he's not running gay bath house. You know? It's like, it's actually like kind of a cool, I don't know. I didn't find a fence to it. Well, it's ridiculous to say that people like that don't exist. Like you're allowed to make a fictional and if a fictional character is really close to actual people, that's when people start getting pissed off. That's when people start saying it's stereotypes. But stereotypes exist for a fucking reason. I don't know if he just went up. I think you're right. If he just went up there and

Speaker 4:          02:49:22       sang dress in that costume as him. I don't know what the, what is actually going on, but

Speaker 1:          02:49:28       I don't read about it. About their soprano's thing. Like the idea of like not using stereotypes is, so in painting a story is so fucking ridiculous. Well because sometimes stereotypes are accurate and if you're going to be able to paint a story, create pain and creative vision, whether it's a television show or a movie, what's wrong with having a black pimp? Is that okay? I mean, it seems like there's black pimps. There's been black, I saw pimps up hoes down. Is it a stereotype? I mean, is this stereotype I tell people, I mean, I've walked Hollywood. I think stereotypes work, especially in commercial. It's like casting directors like, oh, you fit the stereotype of the character. Why? You know, it's just not just that. It's like if you want to paint a story about real life, you would paint a story about things that people can relate to and one things that people can relate to as an Italian guy with fucking pizza stains on his t shirt and gold chains on, those are real people.

Speaker 1:          02:50:20       We're in sweat suits. If you got a guy like we're in sweatsuits like fucking Tony Soprano, go, hey, where's the gap? I'll go, where's the fucking guy with the thing? Yeah, it was his GED, the fucking GED. Those are real people. Like you know those people. If you listen to Floyd Mayweather, it's dad. Okay, that's a real guy. Yeah. It's a real old black boxer. If you're going to make a parody of an old black boxer and you had a guy who could speak very well and he looked like that guy and he started like, if you've got Ian Edwards to do Floyd Mayweather, would that be a stereotype? Is it a terrorist stereotype when he's a real person? That's not that I grew out of them. I understand it's a stereotype, but shouldn't you be allowed to do that when you're portraying fiction? The idea that they, that Italian American Defamation League would want every Italian to be like Leonardo Da Vinci or Michelangelo or something like that. Only the most positive. You're not allowing people to create fiction. You're not allowing them to create art.

Speaker 4:          02:51:12       Is it because it's like actual facial features are like Macklemore's knows or Asian person's eyes. That's actually what they look like instead of wearing what they're wearing.

Speaker 1:          02:51:21       Right. Well I can see what you're saying. So like, like Jerry Lewis when he would do like the nutty professor and he would, they would, uh, the old days when they would do like a fake Asian characters. Well, that's obviously a precedent. That was, yeah, that was very stereotypical, but also very racist. What about that famous actor, actress

Speaker 4:          02:51:39       who won as the, uh, orange is the new black character who was black and she wanted to be that character and everyone's like, that's blackface. But goes back to what is the attention? I have no idea. Can you look that up?
