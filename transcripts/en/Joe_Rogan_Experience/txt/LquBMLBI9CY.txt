Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Bom, bom five four three two, one. We're live here from the valley with the artist formerly known as the amazing atheist. Hello. If I just started talking like that, no explanation. I just kept it going for years. Everything. Like one day he's going to drop it. I um, I kind of dropped it a little. The amazing atheist, right? Yeah. I mean I still, I still use it. I oscillate. I'm kind of trying to transition to just using my real name. Well, the last time you were here you talked about that and that was I think two years ago. So this was a low, it was a year and three months ago. Oh, that's it. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Wow. It was January of 2016. Why do I feel like it was so my memory, I don't know. You know what, that Dunbar's number thing where you can only fit so many people in your brain.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       Yeah. And there's a, there's definitely that going on in my head and then too much data. My hard drive is fucked. You know, have to get an old laptop and he keeps telling you you'd have to delete some files because you're running out of space. And that's my brain. Yeah. I mean my brain is even worse because literally things like things I knew yesterday, I don't know today anymore. Yeah. Like my memory is dog shit. And you were just saying you haven't smoked pot days. Yup. Hmm. Not In days. Interesting. Days and days, days and days and days I fucked up with, had an edible last night I did this a, this is a show that my friend Jeremiah Watkins House and it's um, like a make 'em up show or they call it stand up on the spot where the audience would yell out, you know, uh, Fried Broccoli, like whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       And you just have to rant on Broccoli, like what, what your thoughts are, try to get some comedy out of it. And occasionally maybe one out of 10 subjects, it will actually yield a real bit. That'll come become a bit in your act. It's really kind of amazing because when you put on the pressure like that, so I said, what a good time to test the deep end of the pool and uh, find out what these a speed we'd edibles are all about. Oh, I fucked up. Yeah. Fucked up. My, uh, my brother had a like a panic attack on a edibles just like a few days ago. Uh, my friend brought over some like pot brownies and um, he had one, he's not really used to edibles. Anyway, I go to bed, I'm laying down and watching like star Trek, deep space nine or some shit. I got a knock on the door like, Tj, Hey Max, you come out here for a minute. I'm like, okay, what the hell is this? I got there. It's like, I feel like a man had a heart attack dude. I'm like, dude, you probably just having a panic attack from too much weed.

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       Okay. Has this ever happened to you? Is this we're having to you? I'm like, yeah, it's happened to me before. Just calm down. I know your heart's, you feel disoriented and shit. And, uh, I thought it was calming him down. I've spent like 30 minutes talking him down, but fine. You know, and he seemed like he was like, okay, yeah, yeah, I'm cool now. I'm cool now. And then just all the sudden like, no, I feel terrible. We gotta go to the hospital. I got to go the hospital, I got to go to the fucking hospital. And um, I drove him over there and uh, I, I sat down in that fucking hospital waiting room and they, there was like this fucking ad for Stanley steamer and there was this terrible jingle and I'm like, it's like the worst jingle I've ever heard. It's not going to get stuck in my head.

Speaker 1:          00:03:40       And now to this day, call one 800 steam Stanley steamer years certified cleaner, I'll be in bed at night and that should all be in my head. Just over and over and over and over and over again. They have wizards would come up with those things, man. Even the ones that suck, they just get in there, you know? Oh yeah, it's a terrible one. And he gets out. They gave him some fucking, um, Adavan, you know, you can give them next time. Just give him some coffee. Coffee is like one of the best things. Really. Yeah. There's something about caffeine apparently that counteracts the effects of marijuana when you're a really high, they said just drink some coffee. I'll have to do that next time. Yeah. If that happens. Isn't that true? That is true. Right? At an a hot shower. That's right. Everyone's got their own fucking home remedy for this shit I guess.

Speaker 1:          00:04:25       But here's the thing, once you've done it a few times, you realize, well what the panic attack is, is essentially your brain taking an audit of all the things that are real and a real worries that you haven't been considering at home. And then they fly, well, you're going to die someday. Are you prepared? Like what if it's tomorrow? Are you ready? Have you had a good life? Oh, what if someone close to you dies? You think you're gonna be able to recover. Ah, you just start thinking like really crazy shit. And it just makes you aware of those things. And then once it wears off, you know, you reach that sort of a neutral point again. Well he's a hypochondriac to begin with so that's not good. You can't keep guys like that weed. You should know better. Well he's fine if he smokes it, but if he eats it it's different things, different, different shit.

Speaker 1:          00:05:12       Totally different thing. So um, your podcast, yeah. Was the big podcast that kind of Sunk Milo. It's kind of a combination of Mama need yours. And I remember it was years, it was me watching him on your show that led us to ask about that cause I saw him on your show and he was like God at the time. Cause I remember at the time he was on our show, uh, I told Paul, one of my cohosts like Paul, this guy ain't no lightweight and he's got a huge army of sycophants right now. If you get into debate with him, if you lose, you're a total bitch. If you tie, you lose. If you win by a little, you lose. The only way you can actually beat him with his army of sycophants at this time is if you just demolish him. So don't even try.

Speaker 1:          00:06:01       You were concerned about this, like this is like something you planned out in advance. No, I mean I wasn't really, it wasn't really a plan. I just wanted to bring it up cause I saw him on your show sane and I'm like, that's very strange. I kind of knew where he was coming from. Sure. Cause I knew that he had had experiences, like sexual experiences when he was younger and he was kind of, I think he was trying to trivialize them and turn them into humor. Yeah. I mean, you know, I mean his way of dealing with it or whatever, um, you know, say I owe me and it was mutual between me and the priest. I was molested by a priest, but I was in new it, so it was cool. He was like, I was the predator. Yeah. Like, like he said, Deuce the priest, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       Yeah. Uh, it's kind of hard for me to imagine a 13 year old boy, no matter how flamboyantly gay or sexually aggressive, uh, you know, jumping the priest bones or something, you know. Well, I think it, it sort of gives you a better understanding of how this guy came to be, who he is today and why he's so relishes this role of being the contrarian and being this, uh, this sort of very difficult to pigeonhole gay man who's very conservative but yet believes in man. Boy Love. This is a, if you go back and you read old articles that he wrote for publications that he worked for in the past, um, there was a lot of stuff like we're going to take on bullying on twitter and you know, we need to make a safe space for people. Um, online. This is Milo and now, yeah, he's like the biggest troll.

Speaker 1:          00:07:40       Right? Uh, I mean we talked about my low last time. Uh, I was on your show and you told me you kind of put the seed in my brain, like [inaudible] kind of like fake. And the more I've looked into it, the more I have to question whether or not that shit with the priest even happened to begin with. Yeah. Cause I just don't, I don't know. I don't really trust the shit that comes out of his mouth in terms of like face value. Right. And I think a lot of times when Milo tries to make a point, um, he doesn't necessarily make it by directly saying it. He tries to make it through uh, like performance art. Like when he went on Bill Maher and, um, and you know, he's, he's doing this whole flamboyant gay conservative thing because he wants the, the Liberal Bill Maher audience to be like boom, boom.

Speaker 1:          00:08:28       Cause it's like, oh look what hypocrites. They say they accept gays, but the second you don't tow their line, what they obviously like is people who told their line, not gay people. Uh, I think that was the point he was trying to make. I thought it was funny too, how Bill Maher the next day after, um, Milo scandal broke was like I took him down. It was me. It was his hand. Yeah. It's like I took, I took them down. It's like, dude, you compare it. You said he was the next hitchens when he was on your shit. Wait a minute. He really said he tells him down and said,

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       I took him down. No, choke him down. Oh, he's a fool. That's such a foolish thing to think. I don't, I, you know what I think is what Milo does, a lot of it is performance art. Yeah. It's a lot of trolling and it's a lot of very calculated stuff designed to sort of rile people up and get people active and get people to talk about him. I mean that's the reason why he does this tour on colleges. I mean, why wilds? Why not do it in the lion's den if you want to get the roars? I mean he's doing it like where he feels like this problem is the greatest. Oh, he wants to stir that pot too because he knows if he just does it in some club downtown. Yeah. And it's, there's not going to be any protest and was going to give a shit.

Speaker 2:          00:09:36       It's still protest, I'm sure. But not like bringing it to their camp. They won't be like what happened at Berkeley? Yes. Yeah. What happened at Berkeley? It was just fucking insane. It's really insane. Is that, was it the mayor of San Francisco that was applauding the protests like, hey, fuck face. There was $100,000 worth of property damage. People throwing chairs through starbucks windows and light and cop cars on fire. If this, this ain't good. There's been articles on like the Huffington, I almost made a video about this article on the Huffington post actually, that was basically like, um, violence is as valid a reaction to trump as anything. And it's like, wow, you're literally just advocating for violence. Uh, and you think you're so enlightened. Yeah. It's completely foolish. It's like, it goes in once. Things aren't going their way. It goes against everything they've stood before.

Speaker 2:          00:10:23       Before. What about kindness? What about compassion? What about treating people with love? What about facts? Well, that's okay. When they're in power. Exactly. That's okay when they're in power, but when someone else's in that they don't like it all kind of goes out. They'll kind of goes both ways though it. Oh yeah, it definitely does mean, remember when Obama was in office and there was people that were calling him a Muslim and they were talking about taking them out. I ain't fucking, I remember, uh, I heard rednecks. I was living in Louisiana at the time he was elected and I heard redneck say shit like, man, I can't wait for someone who was Sasha, nate, this piece of shit, you know, there's like, they were looking forward to it. Like not only did they think it was inevitable he'd be assassinated, but it was like, yeah, that's going to be a good thing.

Speaker 2:          00:11:00       That's going to be a good day for America when Obama was finally killed. And when they say things like that and you corner them, you go, okay, well what, what's so bad about them? What Bob would drives you? So nuts. He's a Kenyan, he's a Muslim and he says Shosha list. Yes. Socialists, socialist months. Muslim Kenyon, communist, a secret Muslim. I would love it if someone pulled off socialism somewhere. Like if there was one country can go, well, look, those guys are happy. I mean those folks, if you look at socialism as like a gradient, then there's plenty of countries that are, that have like more or less they're socialists. Pure socialism is a good idea anymore than like pure capitalism. Like, oh, we just need laissez faire. Liberty. Like the the the libertarian idea. Like yeah, the markets will take care of everything. How many libertarians is it take to screw in a light bulb?

Speaker 2:          00:11:49       None. The free market will take care of it. Yeah, well those people get a little goofy and you know, the the most frustrating to me is the anarchists. The ones who walk on, no taxes. No, no cops. No. Nobody fixes the roads and private police. All those. Even wars. Yeah. It's like private police. Like how does that work? You mean everyone, if you're, if you have money, you just hire out your own justice. I mean higher up thugs d does that really seem like they would be objective and in pursuit of like a justice? It seems like they would just be your armed thugs that are going to meet out whatever form of justice you think is appropriate. Yeah, well for sure. If they're working for you, that'd be an issue. If you're the big boss and the big boss wants these laws and forest, you know, and then the big boss passes zone laws on his property, it makes things different.

Speaker 2:          00:12:36       It's like it gets real weird when you're dealing with 350 million people. That's really a part of the problem. It's what, what the style of civilization that works well for one person is not what's preferred by another person and all those things combined with the, the whole an antiquated voting system, the whole ridiculous electoral college system. He just said, we're never going to achieve some sort of peace of mind. Super Delegates and Democratic Party. Those are the most ridiculous. Wait, wait a minute. Hold on you a super delicate so you can, how does that work? You can decide not to vote for the way the entire state voted. Yes, that's right. Unbelievable. And leaving it up to them to make sure that trump doesn't get a stop gap. You know, like because the, the people in power have always been afraid of the actual will of the people. So anything they can do, they want to safeguard like, well if the people choose poorly, you know, we want to be able to stop that from happening.

Speaker 2:          00:13:31       Yeah, we have to those uninformed fools. We can't leave them up to their own decision. In all fairness, I've been around America and there are a lot of uninformed fools. There's a few, quite a few. What do you think you think it's like half of us are uninformed fools. I wouldn't even want to throw out a number, but there's just a lot of people that are stupid. I mean it's hard to know because you know, you really almost don't know what someone really thinks until you sit down with them one by one, you know, one on one and have a conversation. And even then, well you don't keep a real job. Right. When was the last time you had a real job? A job job. I worked at, I hop for two days. About 10 years ago. That's it. More than 10 years ago. And what have you been doing for the most part since then?

Speaker 2:          00:14:12       Youtube. Yeah. See if you can make it live and doing something else. In this day and age you're, you're, you're removed from the grid. And if you, if your mood from the employer, employee grid, you get to see things in a different way. You Go, well this is all temporary and you know, everyone's working towards some future that really never comes. You're, this is like the life that you're experiencing right now is life. Yeah. And most people are spending that time doing shit they don't want to do and it fills up all their time. So then when it comes to government and it comes to like who's leading the country, which directions the country going into, how much time to be

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       actually spend paying attention to it and actually spend really considering it. I mean, I've had a, I've been at people's houses where I'll try to bring up, um, Paul news or politics or something like that. They get sick and people are just like, we don't talk about that in this household. Whoo. It's like Wiley. You don't want it. I mean, like, even like, not even necessarily politics, but just news like, yeah. Did you hear about this thing that happened? I don't like news. It depresses me. Is this a woman? Is this also like a woman's voice? Yeah, that was the woman. And this is a, this is the, it was a woman voice. Not In my house. Woman, not in my house. We don't, we don't put up with that shit around here. We have ways that we allow you to communicate inside these borders.

Speaker 1:          00:15:30       By the way, I did lose my, I hop job by dumping pancakes on somebody. You did? Yeah. Who Was it? This fat fuck. You know what? But I went into the job and, uh, and I was like, all right, look, I, I'm not good with people. Don't put me anywhere near front of House. I'm being the kitchen. I'm going to do. I was living in Alabama at the time. I was like, uh, 18 I had a 32 year old girlfriend. Oh Shit. So I was like, you know, you're mature. Yeah. And um, and she's like, you know, I was laying around the house every day while she went and worked and eventually she's like, you need to get a job. And I'm like, all right, reasonable. I guess. Hey, you're banging a 32 year old. It should have been psyched. Yeah. Oh, well, I was at first, but then when she said, get a job, I was like, yeah, but I did.

Speaker 1:          00:16:17       I'm like, all right, I'm going to try to make this work. So I went to, I hop and they were like, yeah, you just work the back. I'm like, okay, cool. I'll work the back. I'll just, I'll do dishes. I'll just turn my brain off and wash the dishes and you know, I'll, I'll learn to do the grill or whatever the fuck else. A second day I was there, they're like, we're short staffed. We're gonna need you to just take care of a few tables. I'm like, it's not a good idea. I'm not, I'm not good with the public training. We've had to do it. When they say short stuff now sent you out there, they're just like, yeah. And I mean they get, they told me like, yeah, you just, you know, hang out down there orders. Yeah. Just go out, write out, you know, we know you're not going to be great at it, whatever, but go do it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:53       We're short staff. We need you. Everyone else in the kitchen is more vital than you are because they've all been here a long time. So, uh, I went out and I took, I waited on unlike three or four tables and then there was this one fat fuck who maybe like, I mean it, it had been awhile. This bliss place was not well run. The fact that they sent me out to fucking wait tables is evidence of that. So it was like 15 minutes and he hadn't got his fucking, uh, pancakes and breakfast and shit. And he's like, where my pancakes? I'm like, Oh, I'm, I'll go check you better. You better, you better. That just rang in my head, you know, like the same as that jingle. You better, you better, you better, you better. It's like I don't recall you sign in my fucking paychecks.

Speaker 1:          00:17:42       Uh, so I just went up to him with a pancake train. I just dumped it in his lap and like, there you go bitch. Wow. I walked out. That's all it took was you been, you know what, I fucking, I was, I was out there in the parking lot for about seven hours because I didn't have a cell phone. Uh, I didn't have a ride. It wasn't seven hours and we're like four or five, but I was just wandering around in a parking lot. I couldn't even stay in the IHOC parking lot cause I didn't want anyone from there to come in. But I just wondered around the parking lot at the shopping center for four hours waiting for my girlfriend to show up when she finally did, I was just like, yeah, I quit. Didn't tell her the story. Just told her I quit.

Speaker 1:          00:18:23       And uh, we broke up shortly after that I would imagine that wouldn't work out. It didn't work out well. You were 18. Yeah, I was young, so I was young and stupid. You were young. Now I'm a little stupid. You were antisocial, slightly forced into a situation that you didn't desire. I'm extremely antisocial in general. Are you? Yeah, still to this day. But that's interesting because you do youtube videos and you talk and you talk with people on a podcast, which is pretty social. Yeah. I'm getting better at it, but I'm, you know, I'm still, I'm still not comfortable around strangers and shit. Yeah. You get uncomfortable when you do podcasts like this one. Does this make you and go, oh yeah. You know, like a lot of people, um, when, when I guess they figured out I was coming on here again, I read a threat on, uh, the, the drunken peasants, a subreddit where people were talking about, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:09       You know, he's gonna be on Joe Rogan again and then, you know, people are like, yeah, I liked last time, but I hope he's not so nervous this time. Oh, we can't say that because he's like, I'm like, Oh shit. Well, I, I was nervous last time, like last time I did your show, I came in here and I talked to you and then I left and I was like, I have no idea what the content of the conversation I just had was when I got here. I don't remember fucking word. You were already baked out of your mind when I got here. That's true too. That was, I don't remember much of what we talked about either, but it was good. That's why you're back. Yeah. I mean, I, I, I enjoyed it. I've never been able to watch it though. Yeah. I don't watch them.

Speaker 1:          00:19:46       I can't watch it at all. I mean, usually I will watch everything that I'm in and just am in love with the sound of my own voice and obsessive and you know, all that shit. But, uh, like this, this shall, I couldn't watch it just because I can't stand like I can't watch my CNN appearance either. What'd you do CNN about? Uh, I went on CNN because they were doing, there was like a new poll out that showed that the faith was on the decline in America. So they had me on there, but unfortunately I was supposed to be on 30 minutes, but unfortunately that was the day that fucking, uh, ratzinger resigned. Uh, so that it got preempted for that shit. But I was on for about four minutes and I, I had like an argument with a William Lane Craig about statistics and you know, William Lane Craig, he's a Christian apologist piece of shit. He's horrible. He's just wretched. You can watch him debate, uh, hitchins and I think now he never debated duck and speak and watch them debate hitchens. Terrible stuff. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       that sounds like not, not so good. Just the name William Lane Craig. It's like settle down buddy here. Yeah. Why not just William Craig? Why you got through that lane in there? Unless you're married to someone whose last name is lane and that's always a disaster. A hyphenated marriages. That shit just seems like someone's like the, that is an oil wrestling match. Someone's going to lose. You guys are going to lose. It's not going to work. It's too much. Too much struggle for power there. That's true. Hyphenated name plus. What do you do if you have what I mean it? Yeah. Well what happens when it compounds, you know like the kids are born. Do they take the hyphenated name? Exactly. And then what if they meet and fall in love with someone else who has a hyphenated name? Do they then have like four last names with 300 kids in it?

Speaker 2:          00:21:32       You know, it's like so is it just compound over time like until eventually everyone has every single last name. Just hyphenated. That's true. If everybody was so greedy and wanted to be special the way those assholes do, we would all have hyphenated names. Yeah, it'd be a real problem. Maybe just get rid of the fucking name, change shit and just argue about what the kids are going to be named. I don't want to, how do you feel about people changing their names? Like what if you just decided like I want to change my whole name. I'm based in last, might want to become a new person. My Dad changed his name. Did he? Yeah, it did have a crazy last name. Hard to pronounce. No, it wasn't that my grandfather, look, I'm Thomas James Kirk the third, but I'm the first person in my family to have that name.

Speaker 2:          00:22:15       So what? Yeah, what happened was my grandfather was named James Vardaman, Kirk James Kirk. So when my dad was James Vardaman, Kurt junior star trek came out at some point and he's James Kirk. So he's getting star trek jokes nonstop all the time. Finally he was in France and uh, he ordered up some champagne. It was Rome. He's impressing a young woman and they're like, oh it, we'll beam, it's right up sir. And he's like, fuck this name. I got to get rid of this. So when I was born, uh, Thomas James Kirk the third, because he knew he was changing his name to Thomas James Kirk Junior, but he didn't actually officially change it till after I was born. So even though I'm the third, I'm actually the first. Whoa. That's crazy. No one would ever guess that an attribute test. Nope. He would sneak that one right through. That's annoying. That's like there's no one probably today that's named Rick James.

Speaker 2:          00:23:23       Like anyone born after the Chappelle show, there's no fucking way anyone who saw the Chappelle show was named their kid, Rick James. If you're, if your last name's James, you're not going to name your boy rick. Right. I mean, I don't know. Maybe some people are like, damn right, Rick James Bitch James Bitch. That was a real problem with Chappelle's career. Um, that Rick James Bitch thing. People yell it out at shows. Just constantly yell it out. Like White Bros, like, you know the, you know, the, you know, the guy who would yell at, you could see him, you know, I'm Rick James Bitch. Like drunk Rick James Bitch. Woo. Yeah. And he'd just, people apparently just kept doing that. It shows it was like a real problem for awhile. You should've done like, uh, just be like Schwartzenegger just embrace it. Yeah. Schwartz in here, it goes around. He always is using all, you were terminated and all this shit.

Speaker 2:          00:24:16       You know, he just embraces it because he knows people just fucking get that shit in their head and they want to hear it. So he's like, fuck it. Give it to him. Yeah, he did it on the new apprentice. Right? Dominate. Yeah. I never saw it. Did you see it? No. No I didn't. I didn't even watch the old one. But he'll fucking go around like he'll, he'll do all of this little lines. I'll be back and all this shit. You know he doesn't care. No, he doesn't. That's just a trademark. That's his shit. I got scared of it. I love the fucking, there was a rally where someone threw eggs at Arnold Schwartzenegger. They threw eggs. I don't know how they threw eggs and got on his suit and he's like, well that's what's great about America, but they owe me some bacon. You know?

Speaker 2:          00:24:51       It's like, what? You're so fucking smooth, Arnold. You should be president. Threw eggs at them. Yeah. What kind people just looking for a reason to get mad. I'm pissed because Arnold, he's the problem in America. Arnold fucking Schwartzenegger was he a good governor now? Was he a bad governor? No, not really. It was just half assed, half assed, mediocre. Governor, do you think it's almost impossible to jump in later in life without going through the river of politics first? Well, house of cards style, I'm just kind of done it. You're right. But housing, I mean he's in, but I mean is it going to work? You know what I mean? Like Arnold Schwarzenegger got into like in the relationship to the same, you know, the same sort of situation. I mean, does it really, I mean, it works enough to where he's president. It's true. I mean, yeah, it worked that well.

Speaker 2:          00:25:39       I mean, his approval ratings are kind of dog shit, but they always were. But like when you say whether or not Arnold Schwarzenegger was a good, good governor, I don't know. I don't really know enough about it. I would have to like really look into it. But yeah, I mean, uh, the, the big thing was that, uh, he, he tried to pass all these, um, um, I guess the laws is not really the word I'm looking for, but I'll use that. He tried to pass all these like laws and uh, they all failed at the ballot and um, people said he was done and he would just went out and like he went out and made a speech that almost gave you the impression like he'd been against them from the start. Like yes, these terrible laws, they are gone. It's like, okay, you're the one who pushed them, but whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:26:26       He was really smooth that just, uh, operating with crowds and just knew what to say, new, the right attitude to strike. But in terms of actually governing, it was just mediocre. He didn't really get much done legislatively, but he didn't really, he wasn't really a disaster either. Yeah. Well that's what I was thinking like, oh, wonder how difficult it is to get things done. Like we'd only be guessing like sitting here on the outside and that guy that you were talking to, like Obama was a piece of shit like that kind of a guy. Yeah. Like how much of it, how much of it do you think he really grasps? Very little. Yeah. I don't think anybody who's not doing it grasps how complex that system, you know, you and I probably both know that the more people you involve in any sort of endeavor or project, the more difficult it becomes because you're managing all these different interests for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:27:13       So when you're, you know, president or governor or something like that, you have so many people that you're supposed to be representing and they all have different ideas and there they all have their own, uh, there's other legislators who have their agendas and shit. So it's probably pretty difficult to get much of anything done. Could you imagine the stress of that job? I mean, just a mansion. That's why, uh, trump's been golfing so many times just to try to relieve stress. Yeah, yeah, sure. I mean like he, he criticized Obama for golfing too much and now trump's like a big avid golfer.

Speaker 2:          00:27:49       I can't even imagine it. I mean, the guy's 70 years old to like, why would even want to take this on with all that money and all that, you know, all that power already. Like, why would he, why would he want to be the president? It just seems like such a fucking helacious job. Unless he really feels like he can fix things or he's really gonna make a ton of money from it. I mean this is a guy who plasters is his fucking name on, on hildings and shit, you know. So I think it's really just a matter for him of like, this is part of my legacy. You know, towards the end of my life I was president of the United States. It's so weird. It's so weird cause it's, it's another version of what many people did with Obama in this weird way in that when Obama got into office, there was all these like really, really irrational people that said all kinds of crazy shit.

Speaker 2:          00:28:42       And by the way, trump was amongst them. He was a birther. Yeah, he was a member for the longest time. He was convinced. Somebody convinced him. I Dunno who convinced him. I Dunno if you've really relinquished it and realize that it was wrong or if he still holds on to the idea. Did he ever really believe it too? I don't know. You know, I don't know. But you know who started that whole birther thing? Hillary Clinton. Yeah, she did. That's right. That's something that people forget. It was during the, uh, the campaign between her and a Obama when they were trying to get the nomination in 2008. Yeah, yeah. She, she had, well she had one of her little org send out materials that you know, showed Obama and like the like he was wearing like some African Muslim garb shit. Cause he went on a visit to some other co.

Speaker 2:          00:29:27       You look at him, you know, he's Muslim and uh, you know, and trump just ran with that. Yeah. Or a lot of Republicans did to cause it's, you know, well I guess that's just how they play politics. They have some like that, they just run with it. It's just so strange to see when you got to Canada named Barack Obama, I know it's easy. Hussein, Hussein Obama, like Barack Hussein Obama Sane in that to guide it, you know, ran a rack and Obama, it had the similar to the name of the guy that crashed those planes into the towers. And yeah, somebody had a joe really good, well wrote a joke. I don't remember who it was though. It might have been Tony Hinchcliffe but the, I mean it's just, this is almost a s a similar reaction. I don't mean it's less, it's more rational or less rational. What I mean is almost like the energy of the reaction, like the energy of the birthers and the guys who were convinced that he was some sort of undercover Muslim and then he was going to get into the White House and try to take America down from the inside.

Speaker 2:          00:30:29       Like that feeling, that the amount of energy that way his mirror now on the left maybe even though, yeah, maybe even past, I would say probably I might not be right because I might not be remembering it perfectly, but I feel like the energy on the left of people getting mad at trump is more powerful or more, there's more to it than the energy that I saw from people on the right. They wanted Obama out of office, but it might just be my memory. And you gotta remember too, there's an age gap there. Yeah. Cause you know, most of the people who were talking this shit about Obama were, were pretty old. Right. And a lot of the people now that are pissed or really young, so they're more likely to take to the streets and smash things and hold up signs and, you know, act wild and shit and mace people.

Speaker 2:          00:31:15       Yeah. You know, when Bush took office though, like when Bush, uh, was, was being inaugurated, I remember that he was driving down, uh, to the, to the White House during the inauguration day. And they were, you know, with, with trump, the protesters kinda came the next day. But with, when Bush was inaugurated, the protesters were all there the day of. And you know, Bush couldn't even do the little traditional walk down the last few blocks of the, the journey because there was so many protestors and people were just throwing things at the fucking motorcade and shit. So I mean like this is not unusual, but that was towards the end. Now that was the very beginning. What am I, which 1:00 AM I thinking of? Wasn't there one towards the very end?

Speaker 3:          00:31:58       The W

Speaker 2:          00:32:01       I think we're thinking of different ones. Okay. I think I'm, my memory's fucked up, but I think there was one towards the end where they had planned on having him walk down some long stretch and they had to abandon it and get them into a car. Is that the same stores? Uh, yeah. Well I think that was both times. I think it was the first, but even during his first, uh, time, like when he was just first being inaugurated president in 2000 so right after Clinton that inauguration was bad. It was almost the same. Yeah, it was terrible. It was almost the same as what you see now because people had had this Democrat in power for eight years and they thought like, yeah. And they thought Gore is a shoe in because Clinton's popular, just same

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       as like Hillary's a shoe in because Obama's popular. Right. But, you know, a Republican ended up taking, uh, taking it and, and they just freaked out. And it seems like that always just happens. I mean, like this kind of like backlash. Like it always is kind of sold to us as like, this is new, this is like, Oh wow, look at what's going on now. Isn't this crazy what crazy times we live in? But it's, I look back at my memories of the past and it seems like this is pretty par for the course. I think you're right, now that I'm thinking about it, it's almost like we go through these like cycles. Yeah. And if a president gets past one cycle removed from his, his tenure, then people forgive them. They forget and they changed their opinion. Yeah. Like Reagan, like man, when I was a kid, Reagan was a pariah.

Speaker 4:          00:33:30       Like people were so upset about Reagan, they were so upset. And there was the contra versus Nicaragua, a trial that was on television with Oliver North and we were finding out on tv like whether or not the government had sold arms and lied about it and weather. And then, you know, the, the whole Reagan thing with winning that Reagan sold arms to Iran, the great Jimmy Tangle, hilarious standup comedian and Boston has this bit about it because they were, that was when Reagan started claiming all timers or when he claimed memory issues, which turned out to be true. I mean, you really did have memory issues and he probably did it at a time, but they asked him, did you sell arms to Iraq? He said, I don't know. And Timmy tangles, like mister president, if you ever sell arms to people who hate us, jot it down.

Speaker 4:          00:34:22       I was like, make a note, put it on the refrigerator today. I sold Amz to people who hate me. You have to hear him say, I mean, you know it. You have to realize that like America's always has been a huge arms dealer. I mean, we're constantly selling weapons. Oh yeah. I mean like if he, if he didn't remember why he did it, it's probably because there were just so many other transactions. I don't think the president personally gets involved too much in that sort of stuff, but probably not. Country sells weapons all over the place and we continue to do that. Yeah. My point was that like eight years later he was the great Ronald Reagan. Oh yeah. Eight years later, and eyes, he goes through the Clinton administration. Everybody's done with the Clinton getting his dick sucked and the White House and all that craziness. And, and then as soon as that's over, people start reminiscing to Reagan. It's really interesting. It's really interesting how we do it. And so now Bush went through this period of being hated and he's out of office at Obama, goes through his period of being hated for eight years. And now that, and even more unreasonable Republicans in office people long to the Bush days. Oh yeah. Like you noticed they're trotting Bush out and doing interviews with him. Like, Hey, remember this war criminal now he's okay. He's, he's an uncle Bush the bush here. Uncle Bush go set you on his knee.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       They um, super imposed. What does that protests during the Bush administration now figurations. Yeah. Yup. Wow. What does it say? Fuck Bush. Oh, buck flush. Flush. There's a couple of years, not my president of course. Man, of course. So you know, this is, this is all so cyclic. Yeah. It just happens over and over again and people think it's new and you know, for some, I think, I guess it's the country just has a short memory to what a crazy show. This is. What a crazy show we're watching the battle to control the world. Yeah. Political Theater, pageantry. But you know, like it's just, I mean like I don't want to get into like you already had Alex Jones on the show, so I can't really get into that level of territory. But I mean I do agree that these parties are constantly just working together behind the scenes and that 90% of the issues they agree on, they just make a big spectacle of the little things they actually disagree on to distract us with a show.

Speaker 2:          00:36:39       You Look America, look, look at us, we're fighting, we're fighting. Have they stopped paying attention? Okay, now we've met, now we do the real deals. Who are we going to bomb? Who we going to invade? You know, uh, who were going to sell weapons to whatever. Yeah. It's probably definitely some of that. I mean, if they're all working together, if you watch house of cards, do you watch house of cards? Uh, I watched the first season, but when he started pushing people in front of trains and shit, I was like, sh spoiler alert. Sorry. This is the beginning of season two. I mean the vein, seeing that whatever. Listen man, I'm only on season three. Oh, okay. I just got into it. I've been been binge watching Jeanette. Look, I really like Kevin Spacey's performance, but it just got a little over the top for me, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:37:20       All right buddy. Well, we all have different standards, I guess. Uh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't, I'm not insulting the show. Isn't that a funny thing though? Like if someone likes something and you don't like it, it gets personal sometimes. Yeah. Like, especially like music. Oh, music. It's like you listen to that shit. This is really shit you listen to. Like, people get mad. I can get, I can get mad. Like if someone's like, you know, I really liked beyonce or something, I'd be like, you'd get mad. What if you got in the car and someone's playing like some like Electronica, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, uh, uh, you know, like a, like a villain and some sort of a coen brothers movie, like Belsky Villain. Remember those guys? You know, I was a, I was in an uber the other day where someone was playing like, it sounded like fucking elevator music.

Speaker 2:          00:38:09       Like it was like he was just listening to the shit you hear in fucking elevators and it was like a 45 minute drive and I'm just like, oh my God. I mean, I can't say anything. It's his fucking car. This is drive to be fucking up the wall. Could you bring it up to me? A lot of it bring it up. I mean, I, I'm sure I'm allowed to, I mean there, there's, there's nothing's going to happen if I, if I bring it up, but I just don't want it. I don't want to have that discussion like, Hey, can you change your music because it's horrible to me and it's grading on my last nerve right now you're supposed to, you get control of that music and the, with the APP, you know, like, I didn't mean that we bad at dealing with people with the APP.

Speaker 2:          00:38:45       Yeah. With Uber App. There's a button it connects to your spotify said like they're supposed to offer the ox cord when you get in the car so you can control the music with double annoying for the driver I would imagine. But yeah, if they're supposed to give you control, really? Whoa. See I've never, I've never taken that right. So you let them just, I just let them do what they do over with the shitty music. I mean cause I mean at the end of the day they're the ones who have to drive around in this fucking car all day and I'm just getting a ride. So I feel like an asshole being like, no, I'm going to pose my musical tastes on you cause I feel like it's their car, whatever there. Well it's definitely their car. It's also, what's weird is why is music suck to us and it's great to some people.

Speaker 2:          00:39:27       Like what is that? What is it about a song that you go, oh that's a fucking great song. And someone else would go turn that off. I don't know. It's like it, it kind of reminds me of something with food. Like people have different food preferences and shit and I was wondering like, I'm eating a pickle and you know, I like it. Other people hate pickles. So when they eat a pickle, does it taste different to them than it does to me? Or is it the same taste but they just don't like that taste? Yeah. And I kind of wonder the same thing about the music thing. Yeah, I think for sure. I think it's, um, I probably, it's probably a visual thing too and not, not visual in terms of like taking account of space and mass, but visual and account of like what, what each individual image does for you.

Speaker 2:          00:40:13       Like how it looks too. Yeah. I like the overall feeling it gives you, I think it's different for everybody. It just has to be, it has to be, I mean, what would it, what else would account for all the different tastes? Yeah, the obvious different, especially music, but then this like tastes that you very, yourself, like you ever catch yourself in some weird mix? Like you hit ipod shuffle or something like that and you catch some weird mix of songs that you like and you're like, wow, they just do not go together. Like these two are just really weird. Back to back. Yeah. You know, going, going back to the food thing, like, you know, there's certain foods you might like, but maybe together they're not so great. Oh yeah, for sure. And then certain foods you would think would not be good together but are amazing like a pineapple and anchovies. See, uh, I don't, I don't like either of those by themselves. So dude on pizza, the high end apple anchovy pizza. Oh, you're one of those pineapple on Pizza People, Huh? Very rarely. Only with anchovies. I'm not a Hawaiian pizza guy. Yeah. Uh, I don't even think Hawaiians are Hawaiian pizza people. Who's, who's getting that? Hammond?

Speaker 2:          00:41:14       I'm a, I'm a big, if it's Canadian Bacon, why is it a Hawaiian Pizza? That's a real good question, man. That's a super good question. Why is it and how the fuck is that Bacon? It's not, if you go to Canada and say, I want some bacon. They don't bring you that shit. Yeah, that's some, yeah. What is that? That's like a Belgium waffle. Why is it from Belgium? This is a god there isn't a waffle. No, the fucked up thing is I went to Belgium, then I got a waffle there and it's nothing like what they fucking say it, you know that we Belgian waffles here, they're like round and you put it on a plate with syrup. They give you like, it's like street food there. You get like a little tiny fork and there's like a small waffle, it's not even round.

Speaker 2:          00:41:51       And they put whatever the fuck you want. It's not just syrup. They'll put like fresh strawberries and all kinds of shit on there and you just sit there and eat it with this little tiny ridiculous fork. And it's totally different than what what's called a Belgian waffle in America. So it's like one of those, um, you ever go to one of those crepe stands? Yeah, it's in the mall. You know, like they make you a little crepes and waffles and stuff and they put new tell autumn and the watch different. I would say it's probably closer to that. Yeah. That's God damn delicious. That's way better than a Belgium waffle. Fuck yeah. But at Belgium [inaudible] was easy to do, you know, put it in that mold. Yeah. Stamp that sucker down. Paul. Dot. Waffle Tj and Joe Rogan talk about waffles. It's important to talk about Waffles, waffle house, one of the best road foods ever.

Speaker 2:          00:42:34       And uh, cause you can guarantee you're gonna get the same thing pretty much everywhere. No one else, no one else can do hash browns that I like other than waffle house. Sam, good Hash browns. They're putting crack in his fucking Hash browns to the waffles. Ridiculous Dude. And you see someone, you see so much crazy shit at waffle houses too. Like I was at a waffle house and uh, the service was terrible. I was in there for like an hour and a half, but God damn the show was amazing because the cook and the one waitress hated each other and we're fighting the entire time. And it got to the point where she, she runs out, she's in the parking lot crying and he's like, giving me free food, don't report this and now you got free food. Oh Jesus. It's like, all right, thanks. Went to another waffle house. And I was like, uh, not really a kid but like, you know, a teenager, the guy that ran that waffle house was a fucking psycho, the cook, he would just yell at you.

Speaker 2:          00:43:29       He came over to my table one time and he's like, this waitress is uh, getting off soon. I think you guys need to go pay your bill and go, whoa. I'm like, okay. I mean this is open 24 hours. Right? Like what? He's like, no, close it out cause she's got to go, I guess she wants the tip before she leaves or whatever. Um, so that was weird. One time a drunk came in there holding the like a bottle of wine or something and he, and he was just like, no, get that Outta here. That's not allowed in here. Get Out. Whoa. Just like very intense all the time. I think it was like a retired cop or something that was just didn't, I don't know, didn't get his pension or some shit. So he's at a waffle house, then his pension on the waffle house to make it big. I mean, I don't think he wasn't the owner. He's just a fucking cook. Oh, just a cook who's like cantankerous and angry and would yell at you and attack you. Weird food places, men like weird food places you traveling and you for a brief period of time, enter

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       into these people's worlds and watch them interact with iron skillet. I went to, um, this Montana diner, this really small diner outside of billings, Montana with a few of my friends. And uh, we uh, we pulled into this diner and we had just got done hunting for five days in the, in the mountain. So we're just, we were dirty and it was, it was like we were tired. We just been camping this whole time. We just got off of a boat and this guy had a, like a big piece of cardboard, like four by four, like four feet by four feet, cardboard with photos of all these different marines that he had propped up on like an easel board and on it had all the different soldiers that had died under Obama's watch and this one particular mission. And he kept pointed out like, these are, these are 11 of our boys that died because of this president, so-called president that was not my price and it not my brethren, you know, it got to that weird shit. And he was coming over to the table and talking to us while like, while we were there eating. I'm never forget that guy. It was just so bizarre. Like he had to go. Yep. It's terrible. Yup. It was terrible. Can we leave? Like we're stuck while this guy like hovered over us with his, his lecture is powerpoint presentation. I mean, he had like photos of these guys up on this thing and he wanted to talk to everybody about it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:54       Yeah. He, yeah. I had a weird food experience in, uh, Colorado because driving, I drove all the way from Columbus to Seattle when I was moving because we had, um, like dogs and lizards and all kinds of shit. So we just decided to drive it and, uh, you know, to make kind of a road trip of it. We stopped off in Colorado for like a couple days to check that out cause I'd never been there. We're at the hotel restaurant. The waiter we had was fucking like the most bipolar fucking dude in history because we ordered this, you know, uh, fruit and meat, cheese tray or whatever, meat and cheese and you know, some other shit and there's some nuts on it. And, um, somehow it comes up. My girlfriend has like nut allergies. Oh No. And you know, they're not severe. They're really mild and she just avoids it by not eating those nuts.

Speaker 1:          00:46:56       You know, if something touches them, they're fine. But this guy, he's over there like, why didn't you tell me she had a nut allergy? And we're just kind of like, ah, this is not just not a joke. This is a serious matter. Don't laugh. We take this very seriously here. I'm not exaggerating this fucking guy either. Like this is like, he's like a costing us about this shit and he's like, I don't even know if I should bring that out. I don't even know if I should bring that out now. And we're like, just, just bring it out. She just won't eat the nuts. And you're just like, she can not have anything from the tray. You understand?

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       Oh, nothing from the tray. Can She, and were like, and he kept asking like, is it airborne? Is the nut allergy airborne? Some people have an airborne nut out. Sure. But she doesn't, and she told him that and he's persistent and he wouldn't, he'd like ask it but not wait for the answer. And then he'd come back and he'd be totally pleasant. Like, so you guys on the Dah, Dah, Dah. And then he'd leave any, come back again and he'd be crazy again. Like she, she held up her glass. He's, he's like refilling and her glass kind of far away. So she like, you know, holds it out. And he's like, put that back on the table, put that back on the table. It's like, what? Whoa, you're a fucking psycho. That whole city though was high strung shit. Cause I remember I went to a pot shop there and the guy at the pot shop, he was like, first of all you had, I had to go to a waiting room, which is just weird and like take a number. And then I was called into another room when I thought it was gonna be able to buy weed, but instead it was just another waiting room. And then I finally get to the fucking little broom closet where they keep their meager supply a fucking weed and there's this guy behind the counter and he know shit was like, what? I'm like, okay, please watch. And then we had four people with us. He proceeds to do it to everybody. So four times in a row,

Speaker 3:          00:48:55       Yay.

Speaker 2:          00:48:58       I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with you? Like I smoke weed to like chill out and relax and shit, but you're just like, okay,

Speaker 3:          00:49:06       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:49:06       And he's, he's bitching about how hard his job is there too. It's like, man, I can't wait till we get off works that we could get really high. I mean we're already high but we're going keep it real. That guy gets a vote to and then there was a, when I was leaving that fucking place, there was like a syringe like on the floor of the fucking weed shop. I'm like this fucking, it was Colorado. We'd shit as a joke. I think it's way better in Washington. You just go into a fucking store like any other store and buy it. Well, I think what they're worried about more than anything is people robbing them. Maybe that's probably why they make you go through steps. Like step one and step two. Yeah, phased introduction. Yeah. I mean also they can isolate you from the outside if you have, if they have cameras, the cameras are monitoring you. It's probably makes people less likely to try to attempt an armed robbery. Who knows? But you could arm robbed any fucking place I made. Sure. No, it's not like it was exclusive to weed shop for sure. It's just a scary thing what they're doing where they're not allowing them to use credit cards so that they have the keep large chunks cash around and I think they're trying to resolve that. I don't know if they have yet, but it was a giant issue for a long time because they would have to hire these like, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:50:18       like mercenaries essentially. Yeah. You know, guys who worked for like black water and stuff like that to the, those kind of guys to carry the money around or to guard the people that are carrying the money around. Did you hear

Speaker 4:          00:50:27       a jeff sessions recently saying that marijuana is a dis, like it's, it's just a destructive fucking drug that is almost as bad as heroin? Yeah. He said that to, was it today or yesterday? I think it was either today or yesterday that he said, I saw it. It's hilarious that this guy is in charge of anything. Only slightly less awful. Was his words only slightly less off of the heroin. Someone is without a doubt, if that's what he's expressing, someones without a doubt influencing that. Like there's, there's more than just his opinion here. This is not these, when these, they have these meetings when they're discussing policy or the discussing how they proceed. Like this isn't as simple as this one wacky dude's opinion and they leave him alone with his opinion. He has ultimate power. There's no way. There's a bunch of vested interests.

Speaker 4:          00:51:22       There's a bunch of people that have tremendous amount of money at stake and would lose money if marijuana was legal. That is 100% why that guy was doing it. Sure. But I mean, he's, his personal opinion towards weed has always been mean. Like he was at lie like that. Like that's just a fucking lie. You don't have any data to show that that's even remotely true. Heroin kills fuck loads of people. People, their bodies are ravaged by it. Pot doesn't do a goddamn thing to you. It might make you a little loony. Yeah. Just, I mean like, you know, it's not even comparable. No. And if you might be schizophrenia exams where they looked at all the, the population and they said, you know, marijuana contributes to schizophrenia. And they were like, well, no, actually no. If you look at the number, it's always 1% and it feels 1% of smoking pot or not smoking pot.

Speaker 4:          00:52:08       It's still, the schizophrenia numbers have always been around 1%. Yeah. I mean like it can be exacerbated by marijuana, I'm sure. But it's not, it doesn't cause it. Yeah. I think, I don't, I'm not a brain scientist, nor are you, are you? You're not. I had, I've, I've dealt with schizophrenia. People, you know them, right? Yeah. Yeah. I've known a few. It's, um, I think it probably varies like any other kind of mental illness. But what pisses me off though more than even like the personal angle of like, I'm a pot smoker and this affects me personally. I mean, that does get my goat a little bit, but what really pisses me off is that trump is mr jobs. Yeah. This industry, this $7 billion recreational marijuana industry is employing, uh, like a hundred, 150 people. Yeah. Uh, part time and full time that are along some rung of the ladder of like, oh, well, you know, either they're working for the growers or they're doing the packaging are there helping with the shipping. So this is like a huge job creator. It's a huge money maker. This is what trump ran on. Trump's like, I'm the jobs president. I'm going to bring jobs back if they go after this industry. That's the exact opposite of bringing jobs back that's shutting jobs down. Yeah. What's shutting jobs down though? With a

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       kind of people that we don't really want around the first place? I mean, they can, they can sort of surmise that people that are running pot shops are probably pretty left wing, you know, pretty, pretty quickly. Sure. So you're making almost, you're making more money for your opposition, whereas the pharmaceutical companies, they, they, they're nonpartisan. Don't forget the alcohol and just, yeah, that's true. Both of them. The prison unions, prison guard unions. That's what's really crazy. You find out that prison guard unions have worked to try to keep marijuana illegal. You're like, wow. Like what you're really saying is we want to extract money by putting people in cages and says, you're really saying that's what you get when you do a private prison industry. Goddammit, Dj. I mean, I've done videos about this fucking private prison industry. It's crazy. And you know, I'm always surprised by just how tap it, the responses.

Speaker 2:          00:54:13       People are like, Eh, yeah, whatever. You know, prisoners who gives a shit. It's like, yeah, but what about the fact that plenty of people don't belong to be there? What about the fact that these people who run these prison industries sponsored legislation to put more people in jail in a country that already has the disproportionately highest prison population of any country on the planet while claiming to be the fucking land of the free? Yeah, we put a fuck load of people in jail. Tons. I think what, uh, what is this statistic? Some, some bananas thing about the percentage of people to the United States puts in jail as opposed to the rest of the world. But the rest of the world kills people. Yeah. I mean, look, they don't bother me. Don't bother locking you up as much in some other countries. They just take out in the back and fucking shoot you in the head.

Speaker 2:          00:54:56       So you know that mass grave they just found no, they found a mass grave in Mexico. Really, really bad one. Apparently they've found has made 200 as many as 250 bodies. Cartels or, yeah. Yeah. See if you can find that Jamie. It's a creepy story man, because some teachers found it. They were looking for something else and they, I think they just found some bones and they started digging in and they've only done like an excavation of a certain percentage of the land too that they're looking at and then look, it might be as much so there could be extensive mass graves throughout the entire area. Sure. They didn't know this existed. Here it is more than 250 human skulls found in Mexico. Jesus. Yeah. Mass grave containing more than 250 human skulls was uncovered in central Mexico. Most likely the victim of drug cartels over the years of Jesus.

Speaker 2:          00:55:50       Either then or one very prolific serial killer. That's a guy who's really getting shit done. Yeah. This is terrifying, man. And it's really terrifying that this, this massive drug war is happening to fuel the illegal drug market over here and it's happening with a country that's connected to us. It's right there. It was like this massive issue going on, right? Yeah. And well, why do you think the build a wall rhetoric is so effective? Of course. Sure. But it's just even more, well that's like, that's like the least effective option. It's terrible. It's just the best option

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       would be to make it legal and regulate everything and to let adults do whatever the fuck they want to do. And if some asshole wants to take math, let them take math. Let them by math. Yeah. He can buy adderall already. A lot of these people who are doing these crazy drugs, they're only doing it because better drugs aren't available. They can't find them. They're too expensive. Like, if you just legalize and regulate all these markets, which are, we know for a fact are going to exist no matter what because people are just going to do fucking drugs, whether it's legal or not legal. Do you know the only variable? The only thing that I really worry about though as opiates because I feel like if you made opiates legal, if you made them more accessible, I just know way too many people have lost their lives on them.

Speaker 4:          00:57:03       Yeah. I know way too many people that have taken them and then they just, the whole thing got real slippery and they just started fucking up at work and they do, we're on them all the time and they got real foggy. I mean, look, we live in a country full of obese people and uh, you know, I'm, I'm pretty obese. Um, that's terrible for your health. Probably not quite as bad as severe opiate addiction. Nah, it's not even close. But you know, like it, it leads to a whole plethora of health problems. And look, I mean, like we live in either we believe that people have the freedom to make their own choices about their own bodies or we don't. Right. And to me, you know, even if there is negative repercussions, negative repercussions to being pro second amendment, you know, we, we do have more gun violence because of that.

Speaker 4:          00:57:47       I still believe in the second amendment. I do believe in probably more regulation for it. But do you just fucked up right there son? Yeah, he's opened up. The Gates happened opening the gates of hell. It's like you're smarter than the founding fathers. You're fucking, were you going to update the Second Amendment? I mean, we've already got the damn waffle house waiter. We already updated a plenty of, uh, aspects of the constitution. Not Officially, but you know, like the privacy clause that's just fucking gone. You know. So the fourth amendment is just, you know, it's, it's basically no and void at this point. I don't want anybody doing heroin, but I don't think that it should be illegal. I just, I think that stuff, I, I bet in certain circumstances under severe pain, certain opiates, especially like natural opiates probably feel wonderful if you have like a severe back pain, you can't rast and you take something like that and you can, the real problem is those fucking pills get in people's DNA, man.

Speaker 4:          00:58:44       They, they get attached to you in some terrifying way. Yeah. And they, people get into the more than almost anything I've ever seen. And they actually are like, the gateway drug thing is kind of mocked because it's attributed to weed. Those pills usually our gateway to, you know, begin injecting if they don't inject. I mean they'll inject if it, if it works just as good and that's the only way they can get it. Yeah. And that's what happened with a lot of people in Massachusetts. It was a, one of those episodes of Anthony Bourdain's show, he was out like near, I forget what area of Massachusetts, but it was all about how many people had been devastated by heroin

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       addiction and heroin overdoses. And a lot of it came out of the oxycontin addictions. Yeah. They got the pills really easily. And then when it became less, Lindsay started cramp clamping down the regulations and made it harder for people to get prescriptions, then people turn to heroin because they were addicted to opiates. Right. Because a, it was a nap. It was just a part of who they were at that point. And you know, the whole country right now, I mean like, because of there's a big opiate crisis, you know, they're trying to, doctors are not writing as many of these opiate prescriptions and if they're trying to make it harder to get, so a lot more people are turning to heroin. So now we just have a heroin crisis and people don't know how much to take and they're overdosing and dying. It's so spooky and yeah, but if it was regulated, um, you know, the same people who are already addicted to it, who are already going to seek it out or are you going to find it?

Speaker 2:          01:00:10       First of all, there's no stigma so they can actually go seek fucking treatment for it, you know? Right. It's pretty, it's pretty difficult to admit you're a heroin addict when you're scared that you might go to fucking jail just for what you do. Well, they don't use the best stuff to get people off drugs anyway. Yeah. Supposedly the most effective, and this is not from my personal experience, but the most effective drug to get people off drugs is that I began stuff I began, which is from the Boga Tree. And uh, apparently it has a massive impact on people that are addicted to heroin and pills and alcoholics and things along those lines. Apparently that stuff just fucking knocked it right out of your system. Interesting. And yeah, and like really excellent rate of, um, people staying off of it. Excellent percentage of people stay off of it permanently as opposed to a lot of the other methods.

Speaker 2:          01:00:59       It's hard for people to change their ways, you know, that people get into these little patterns and they get into these habits and if, if one of those habits also is physically addicting as well, like heroin is, or like pills are. Yeah. It's just really hard for people to kick that shit. It's terrifying to me, man. I understand the kind of, because I do smoke. Right. How much do you smoke? Uh, you know, uh, at, at the worst it was probably like two packs a day. Oh Dude, that's a lot. And um, you know, now it's probably like half a pack a day. That's better. I've been down though to as low as like three or four cigarettes a day. Why don't you just limit yourself to something like that? Uh, cause the only way I can actually do it is to get my girlfriend or my brother or somebody to Dole them out to me cause I don't have the willpower to just say I ain't going to do it.

Speaker 2:          01:01:48       What if you like? And then he puts a lot of stress on them to have to regulate it and me fucking bothering them and I'll, I'll fucking deviously just like sneak out and go to the gas station had like another pack. So I'm smoking those four, but I'm also secretly smoking like another four or five off somewhere else. Well that's ridiculous. Yeah, I'm terrible. Yeah, that's absolutely awful. Do you, uh, have a problem with that type of behavior or accepted? No, no, no. I realize when I'm doing it like, wow, I'm a total piece of shit for doing this. You, you know, is it just the moment feel so good to suck on that cigarette to feed? It's really not because it's fucking horrible. Every time I smoke a cigarette, I'm like, why am I doing this? Huh. But what happens is there's that moment before or more than a moment, like the, the lead up to smoking a cigarette.

Speaker 2:          01:02:35       It's like, God damn, pet cigarette. When I get it, it's going to be so fucking good. Really. It's going to make me feel just fine and all this. And then I start smoking. I'm like, man, this fucking sucks. And then I put all smoke it or I'll smoke half of it and put it out or whatever. And then, you know, next thing I know, 30 minutes to an hour later it's like, man, that next cigarette I smoke, it's going to be so fucking nice. Oh, okay. So it's the feeling before the cigarette that you, the anticipation and the immediate reward is what the immediate reward is. Like. Disappointment. Really. It's just like, this sucks. This is, this doesn't taste good. This isn't really changing my brain chemistry in a significant enough way. It looks cool though. It, you know what rebel, the visual element is nice.

Speaker 2:          01:03:24       I like seeing the smoke just fucking climb up and shit. Yeah. That big fucking little stream of smoke and it curls around and gets bigger and does all those fucking little weird acrobatics and shit. But it does put you into a certain mindset if you're acknowledging that you're doing something absolutely ridiculous. This detrimental to your health. Yeah, no, it is. There's no, there's no debate. There's no division, not a terrible it, and you're like, I'm going to fuck as naive and I don't give a fuck though. I'm just, I'm just fucking stupid. It's just like, wow, I'm just a fucking drone for this shit. It's a little bit of that, but it's a little bit of, I want this cigarette in my body right now more than I want to be healthy later. Yeah, exactly. That's true. Cause you're healthy enough to smoke it. Instant gratification.

Speaker 2:          01:04:10       Instant. You'd just given a little piece of yourself to death. Just a little piece. Yeah. Just let me take a little piece. Ego Death. Yeah. You're just going to give you a little bit of my life force. You just take that and in exchange I'll puff on this stupid. Yeah. It's like there's a bank of stick of leaves. How much she put in. How much do you take out and when you're, when you're smoking cigarettes, you're greedy. Who take a lot out of your account. Yeah. Just digging into your account and all of sudden, you know, you go to the shop and you're like, yeah, can I get this on credit? And like, dude, you're out of credit. Oh it's over. Damn, you fucked up your lung son. He burnt them off. Yeah. That's really what kind of, what it is. Right. I agree. I don't have any argument with that analogy.

Speaker 2:          01:04:53       I don't know. Wouldn't say stop doing it if you don't, if you don't feel like, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm uh, uh, I went to my fucking a doctor recently and they, they gave me a book and I haven't read it yet, but it's supposedly it's going to help. So on cigarettes. Yeah. I'm Mike Lacey who owns a comedy and magic club. His wife works with people that have terminal lung cancer. Yeah. And he was explaining how they die and he's explaining that you're essentially, you're drowning in your own fluid and that you're, you're, you're gasping for air as you leave this life. Yeah. He goes and people are in sheer horror and terror and he said, it is not something you ever want to do. The fucking, uh, the smokers war or some shit, man, maybe should I fit. Thing is when they go bad, they go bad away from us.

Speaker 2:          01:05:46       They go bad there in those hospitals somewhere locked up in a room and the nurses get to see them and they'll tell you the nurses are the ones once you talk to, if you want to find out how horrible it is to watch someone die from lung cancer. Yeah. Well the way Mike Lacey was explaining it to brian red band, but meanwhile went right in there and write out there and fell on the ground. Yeah. You know, that could happen. Right. And hit by a bus tomorrow, but not live forever anyway. Yeah. Just too much, too much a desire to get that, that feel. It's also, it's like a rebellious attitude that goes with it. I don't give a fuck about my health. Why do I give a fuck about anything? Yeah. I mean, I, I do have problems, uh, finding like things to be passionate about or care about.

Speaker 2:          01:06:33       Um, but I guess in some ways I've tried to cultivate that because you know, like George Carlin and shit. Yeah. Like I loved that idea of, yeah. I'm just, I'm an observer here. Like, I'm not going to be part of this. I'm just going to look at it from the outside and be detached from it. And I've tried to, I've kind of tried to cultivate that in myself, but I've also noticed like it's kind of hard to, to draw upon my own passions the more I do that. So I don't know if I need to find a happier medium or what. But that's interesting. So in your analysis of a subject, like when you're doing these youtube videos, you almost like an outsider looking in and you, you feel like there's like, there's like a good strategy to that maybe are a good, uh, I think it's, I try to make it, I guess I try to use it as like a thing to bolster objectivity.

Speaker 2:          01:07:23       Like I don't want to be just saying what the crowd wants to hear, right? I don't want to be a just saying things because I think like this is gonna be the most entertaining or whatever. Like I want it to be like, here's what I really fucking think about this. And I think you have to have like some kind of a wall of detachment because you know, people aren't always going to react well to it and shit too. Yeah, that's a really good point. You almost have to be in this sort of antisocial place because you, if you're too social with these people, you won't judge them correctly. I mean like, look, people are very worried about, um, especially lately about like advertising and Shit influencing, uh, what people do and say, but like, people don't really realize that it's, it's, it's really just as much of a danger to become beholden to the audience or to the

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       mob and to go along with, here's the, here's what we really want to hear from you for sure. And it's like, well, maybe I might be what you want to hear, but that's not what I'm gonna fucking say. Hey Tj, how about you stick to this? Yeah, exactly. To go back to your lane, what's your lane, Bro? Yeah. I mean, I'm sure you sound like you've experienced this as well.

Speaker 4:          01:08:36       Look, there are a lot of people out there in this world and if you want to get opinions from every single one of them and consider them individually without meeting any of those people, to me that's shitty data. Okay. That's not good data. If I know you, I've talked to you. If you tell me something and you're smart guy, I'll consider, I'll be like, okay, well I know Tj and Tj was saying that he wouldn't be saying it if he didn't believe it. So I have to think about what he's saying and I'll have to go through my head and find out whether or not I agree with them. I'd have to objectively look at it. You could be talking to a million insane people. You really, there's no way you could individually react to each one of them, but you can get a sense of whether or not people were upset at you or not. Oh, sure. It can get a sense of whether or not logical people make sense. Like that makes sense. Feel like you've crossed a line.

Speaker 1:          01:09:26       Look, I've, I've noticed this really weird shift in the Zeit geist um, in the last like year or so. Um, and it kind of started with this whole fake news thing. You know, the left was saying the trump got in because of fake news and then trump saying, oh, they'll all the attacks against me or fake news. And uh, I've seen on Youtube, I'm like, we used to do this kayfabe stuff on our show. Kayfabe is like wrestling talk for like, you know, fake, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the pageantry of it. Like we're just pretending drama and shit. We used to do it all the time on my show, the drunken peasants podcast. Suddenly people turned on it. They're like, we don't want this anymore. And it's it, you know, and I got, I got shit because I did this, a sponsored ad for this app called candid. And people are like, you know, everything you say is bullshit because you did this sponsored spot for candid, and you're fucking a shill. So we dismiss you. And it's because everyone's on this big fucking authenticity kick. But they're not really actually skeptical though. They're, they're just, they just want a demagogue to spew. Like, here's what you already think is true. I am here to validate all of your feelings and all of your opinions. And a lot of these people seem to want me to be that, but I'm not that. Yeah, they,

Speaker 4:          01:10:43       they're going to want you to form to whatever their opinion of you is. And if you deviate from that, there's going to be a certain amount of people that are going to be upset, but it's up to you to, to figure out, like what is the worst thing, I think for any, any performer or artist is to get boxed into like kind of a fake thing. Like maybe a character that you do or something along those lines and then you can't get out of it. Rick James Bitch. Yeah. Well like, yeah, like Bobcat goldthwait had the hardest time because he had that I, you know, the character that he would do with screaming and yelling bobcat character. Yeah. And then he wanted to just eventually b Bob Goldthwaite and people like, no, fuck that man. Where's the bobcat thing? Like it took him years to get away from that. He got his films by the way. Oh, it's, films are great. Did you see the big foot movie know Willow Creek? It's haven't seen any horror movie. It's really good. Is it? It's, he did it like a Blair witch project type thing of these people up there, a sasquatch hunting. And, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:11:42       look, I don't want to say anymore, but I'm pretty skeptic. I'm, I'm like a big skeptic. I don't believe in a lot of this stuff, but I'm really fascinated by things like big foot and aliens and the lochness monster in the flat earth and the hollow worth and all this stuff. Don't believe in any of it. In fact, I think most of it's like totally fucking ridiculous. But I find it really fascinating, um, because I kind of view it as like almost like modern mythology. You know, you, you kind of see the genesis of how people talk. You know, people used to talk about like suck buses coming in in the night and you know, stealing their, their essence and shit and seducing them, you know? Um, and you kind of see like the modern versions of that is like the alien that takes you up and it was ship and shoves a probe up your ass or whatever. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:12:27       Well I think alien, the alien thing absolutely has something to do with dreaming 100%, because a giant percentage of these abduction events occur when someone's either napping or when someone's sleeping. It's a, they're always unconscious sleep paralysis. Yeah. Well, it's not even just that. It's, it's probably psychedelic compound compounds that are released in the brain during rem sleep. The reason why you have these wacky fucking dreams, I mean, you have dreams that are so insane. They're like a psychedelic trip. Yeah. Like an imagination. It has control of the psychedelic chemicals, a power your brain and runs you on a trip. I mean, that's where are, or,

Speaker 1:          01:13:04       um, I had, uh, I don't really suffer from it too bad anymore, but like in, in my late teens and early twenties, I had really bad sleep paralysis. Whoa. And, uh, also, uh, a company that was a, I forget if it's called hypnopompic hallucinations or hypnagogic hallucinations, but, um, I could tell you right, you know, like, uh, I'll be laying in bed or I would be at the time and, um, I would kind of wake up but I wouldn't be able to move my body. And then, you know, and, and aside from that, you feel the overwhelming sense of like there's another presence here and it's ominous and you fucking, uh, if you have the hypnagogic hallucinations or hypnopompic hallucinations that there one is when you're, you hallucinate as you're going into sleep. One is when you loosening as they're coming out, I have the one where you hallucinate or coming out of sleep. So I would wake up and uh, probably the first time it happened I was 11 and I saw this robe to figure like walk across my bedroom. And then when I was 15,

Speaker 2:          01:14:13       what did it look like? A real thing. Oh yeah. Like it looked totally real. It didn't look like it was transparent, right? No, no, no. It just like, it didn't look like a dude. Cause there was like four feet tall. Oh look, a gnome. Yeah. I mean I, I assumed it was like, because my uncle is a big Ufo guy, so I'm like, I saw an alien and at the time I was convinced to that. Later I became more skeptical and when I was like 15 I woke up and I saw this fucking a figure standing at the foot of my bed. You ever seen the movie dark city? Yes. It did that sleep thing from dark city and I was like, okay. And I went back to sleep. Holy Shit. I woke up the next morning. I'm like, uh, if that happens again, I'm going to fucking tackle this thing.

Speaker 2:          01:14:58       You sure that wasn't just a dream? Uh, I'm pretty sure I was awake because the fall, the fall of two weeks later I saw it again and I did like, I plan to do, I fucking jumped up and I tried to tackle it. It just kind of disappeared in my arms when I got to it too. And I was like, okay, well that was okay. I'm, I'm, I was relieved because I'm like, it was obviously a hallucination and I look up and it's fucking head is floating there and it just done this head vanishes. Whoa. Um, but these are just hallucinations. I mean maybe, maybe if they're not houses hard interdimensional beings, how do you know cause uh, sound so confident. I've read pretty extensively about it. Cause like when that shit happens to you, you want to know like what's going on here. So when they can, they can induce that state and uh, you know, like they can put you into sleep paralysis and you'll feel the presence and you'll experience seeing things and all that stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:15:53       They can put you in that mindset. It's a matter of electrically stimulating certain areas of the scalp. Right. Yeah. Which is really fascinating, isn't it? That they can actually target areas of the scalp and induce certain feelings and certain thoughts. Yeah. We kind of delved into this last time we talked. Yeah. Consciousness and the afterlife, things of that nature. I wonder though, like what would cause you to recall like an image from a really fucking cool movie like that? And have it be like what would weird combination of things would cause, you know like when I was reading causes a hallucination to take a certain storm. Like what is it? Is it your insecurities and fears is you're, you're, you're nightmarish vision of, it's the same thing that leads you to have certain visions and dreams and things. I mean like it's part of your memory and psychology just manifest imagination as well.

Speaker 2:          01:16:41       Yeah. Yeah. Like A, there was a guy, uh, I was reading about his experiences and he, he would see the, the, the guy from the front of the extra poster. Oh, Shannon, his room. He'd see that that silhouette holding the, the briefcase and Shit and looking up at the bill. The building dude, when I was a kid, that movie was fucking terrifying. Like you could watch it today and never fully impact what it did to people like me. What year is that? Like I want to say it was like 76 does that make sense? Which means I was like nine years old. Find out what, what year the extras this was, what year was that? I remember seeing the 25th anniversary. 73 isn't like 73, so I was younger than that. Who the fuck? Let me watch that. That's ridiculous. Mom, mom, how dare you?

Speaker 2:          01:17:27       But uh, I remember being scared out of my fucking mind at this movie. Yeah, there's that. There's the image that movie fucked with my head for years and I started thinking about demons and the idea of being possessed and what could happen. Yeah. He watched it today. You'll laugh your ass off. Oh yeah. I was watching, I was watching that movie a at my uncle's house and my mom came in the room and she, she's like really easily frightened and stuff and she just thought it was hilarious. The extra assist is hilarious. I mean, it's funny by today's standard, but like if you go watch it in the context of like watch horror movies that came around around the same time and before it, and it's like, okay, you can kind of see why this blew people's minds at the time. Well, when it happened, when that movie came out, they had never been anything like on that level.

Speaker 2:          01:18:12       We're a little cute little girl had, becomes a demon and starts ramming across and do her pussy. Yeah. Just fuck me father. Fuck my father's slamming. Which saint fuck me. Jesus. Which what did she, she was just saying fuck me. I don't remember whether she was like, fuck me. Fuck me. Oh, Jesus Christ. I like what she's like, yeah. I'm not a Saas Cox and hell yeah. It was a beautiful moment in cinematic history. I couldn't believe that that was actually in a movie that they said that in a movie. Yeah. I mean like she was having trouble getting away with that fucking now given the age of the actress. Oh, they wouldn't be allowed to. It would be illegal now. It would, it would be illegal. No, no, it didn't, it didn't like show anything. Uh, but yeah, it would probably be controversial even if it was made.

Speaker 2:          01:18:57       Just making that little kid act like that. Yeah. Look at those pictures of her, like when she was screaming and yelling, first of all, that little kid was fucking terrifyingly good. Oh yeah. And you know, the, they, they, uh, she was, they didn't have much, well, like care for her wellbeing or anything either. Cause like, you know, that scene where she's spasming and flopping up and down. They were doing that with wires and that fucked her backup for life. Really? Yeah. Oh Man. Total disregard for, for her safety or wellbeing. Fucked her backup for life when she was a little kid making his movie. Yup. Wow. Like what did it do to her back? Do you know specifically? I don't know. It just gave her back back issues. I don't know if they were severe or what, but she, something got polled or something got out of alignment. I mean, you saw how violently they had flopping up and down on that bed. Yeah. That's not good. So, you know, the, the standards were different, I guess at the time, but, but uh, I think most people should realize, don't, uh, don't permanently injure a child just to get an effect. You want in a movie. My kids are watching this TV show. It's like an old Disney show called good luck, Charlie. Yeah. And Charlie's a little baby. It's a baby. Baby is the cutest little baby,

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       but it's a baby. Yeah, like maybe a year old or maybe two at the most like it's tiny little thing. And that's the bane character. Like imagine like not only do you not get to choose whether or not you want to be famous, want to be an actor cause you're a fucking baby. You can't even talk yet. You're already on tv but the whole show's about you so you can't quit. Yeah. And you know, I was wondering like it when I'm watching movies, like you see babies like crying and stuff and you know like how they make that baby cry, they bite them. Does this seem ethical? It doesn't really seem ethical. Definitely not ethical. It's fucked up man. That's why when people are like make fun of that a American sniper movie for using that little shitty plastic baby. Oh it was obviously fake.

Speaker 4:          01:20:52       I'm like whatever. It's better than fucking having some real kid and getting it to cry and stuff and whatever. I blame clinics went on that. Like you should have phrased that better to frame away from that. You could have sold it better. Yeah, you could. You could have filmed that in a different way. He films things a lot of times in a very sort of traditional way. Yeah, he's a great director and everything like that. But how the hell did he not see that rubber baby? They'll look so funny. He's pretty old, you know, give him, give him a little, I guess, but somebody there with them in the editing room, going home, street swept off. It's rubber baby. It's pretty obvious. Who's going to, who's going to tell dirty harry that the scene doesn't work? Did you know? I know, I got it. Remember when, uh, that whole movie was, that was a weird time when that movie came out.

Speaker 4:          01:21:36       That was like a movie where you had to say you liked it. If you didn't say you liked it, you risk violence. I just, I just didn't see it, so I seen it. I've seen it since then, but at the time I didn't watch it. It just wasn't a very good movie. Now a lot of people love the movie and to them it was really good. To me it was, it was, it was like so much, and this is probably my personal bias of like being out here and being in Hollywood and knowing how writers work and knowing how, you know, like they, they structure these things and how this, what kind of effect the studio wants to have on the audience. For big mainstream movie, you could feel like the heavy hand of of Hollywood all over it and you could feel like the way they were, the wording, the things that he said and the just all the whole thing was like so affected.

Speaker 4:          01:22:24       It's like I'm, I'm not getting a good sense of what this guy's real life. It was propaganda. Yeah. And then you know, and then you find out about the Jesse Ventura thing where Jesse Ventura sued him because he made up some story and them up. And apparently there was a few other stories that weren't true as well that were in that book that fucked a Jesse venture is a career up a little bit too. Yeah. He was just don, he was talking about it. It cost him over a million dollars in legal fees. Yeah. And he's been doing it for what, four years now. Got a judgment in his favor, but then they, they did shift lead, took it away somehow. I forget. They lost on appeal. It's not good. The whole thing is not good because hey, he's a hero. Well

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       it's, it's really, it's just, you know, the truth is truth and you, you can't just make stuff up about people and you know, maybe he should've dropped the lawsuit when the guy died. You know, maybe that would have been better for everybody, but that this his decision, he felt like he was wrong. Then he felt like he was going after the publishers. When the legend becomes truth print the legend. Yeah. Sorry. It's just, I think also you're dealing with the pressures of war being so alien to most people that when you and I who have not been to war, sit, sit around talking and debating about what it's like to be like the most decorated sniper ever. Or a guy who experiences that much action and sees that much death and to really try to rationalize what goes in and out of their mind and like what their grasp on reality is like.

Speaker 4:          01:23:56       And then there's also the opportunity that this guy has. If you're leaving the military and writing a book, why not just make a bunch of crazy shit up and make it even better to sell more fucking books? You know? I mean it's very possible that someone would take that attitude like, look, I'm not going to tell you most of the truth anyway cause it's not in your business. And it's, some of it might be classified and some of them might be illegal for me to talk about, but maybe I'll make up a bunch of crazy shit, sell some bucks. Now I'm on the selling me stage of my life.

Speaker 2:          01:24:28       Yeah. You know, and look, he was probably always doing that to some extent, you know, because you didn't, you know, you don't become the, the top American sniper unless you already have a preconceived notion of yourself as like, I'm this bad ass and I'm this great warrior. And anything you can say to add to that, you're gonna, you're gonna say, well, I think maybe more, maybe you could just be a badass sniper, right? Can you just be just some dude who just excels? Well, I mean, but you look at his character in this, the sort of stories these made up and shit, and it's obvious that, you know, while he did have actual skills, he was also fond of embellishing the skills he did have to make himself even more legendary. Yeah. And why is the question, you know, because there are people that think that the horrors of war, like we talked about, bend the mind and Ben Perception and Ben, the way you look at reality and in some people more severe ways and other people. Sure. It's, uh, the, the I, the, the request or the, the, the, the task that we give young people where they go off to war at fucking 18 years of age and we ship

Speaker 4:          01:25:31       them off, get them to shoot people and then comeback and integrate and try to be a normal part of society. And then with almost no education, almost no assistance, no help. No, no. Karen them along. No. You know, you mean she'd be looking at them and talking to him very carefully. You've asked him to do

Speaker 2:          01:25:48       crazy thing. Yeah. I mean, especially at the, the, you know, like 18 is around the time when I was just willing to dump like pancakes on some dude's lap because he fucking, you know, set across thing to me. So to take people at that age and who haven't even really, I mean, I guess they've kind of reached the age of reason and stuff, uh, in the eyes of society, but you know, they're, they're not like fully formed adult minds yet. It's like, hey, you're, you're pretty much still a kid in a lot of ways. Go overseas and kill some other people's fucking kids. Let's just see what happens. You know, let's try over there and blow some brains out. Oh, you blew out more brains than anyone else. You're a hero. You're great.

Speaker 2:          01:26:31       It's a weird way of looking at it, but that's, that's what it is. Yeah. You know, when you're asking someone to do something before there a certain age, like you're, you have a certain amount of authority over a 17 year old or an 18 year old. When you give them a gun and tell them that they're supposed to do it, they believe they're supposed to do it because you're older and you tell them that they're supposed to do it. So reason why 40 year old guys don't sign up for the army because when a guy's 40 might have a family of his own, might have a life of, as long as they're like, wait, what? Why the fuck are we going over there? What are these guys done to us? Hold on, hold on. When are we charging a dawn with the plan? Like you're going to ask questions and I've going to just trust you at face value and that's no good.

Speaker 2:          01:27:10       It's terrible. Well you want, when you want soldiers, you want someone who just listens. Yeah. Who are you listening to though? Like who were you listening to and why you listen to that guy and what, how'd you get into this situation? Well, they don't think about that. They're fucking 18. It's just asking people to go from that to regular life. It's such a bizarre request. Yeah. My stepdad tried to get me to join the uh, the military when I was younger cause he's like, he saw me and like your life has no direction. You know what? You need military. I thought about doing it. I didn't really give it much thought. I went to the recruiting office and let them give me a sales pitch. But yeah, I'll see you went that far. I never went into her acuity recruiting office. Thank God I took a test and they're like, you could be a, you know, military intelligence.

Speaker 2:          01:27:55       I'm like, Eh, but I heard that a lot of times they sucker you in with that. Like you're going to be military intelligence. Then if you don't cut it, they're like, well, you didn't cut it. You're a grunt now. Yeah, I've heard that. I've heard that recruiters will bullshit you and tell you they're going to get you some cool job inside the military and then once you get in there they give you or fuck the job. They were thinking about giving you in the first place, you know? Yeah, yeah. They don't, it's not like a college where you, you know, yeah, you get to choose your major and all this, none of that. No. They, they'll decide in many ways it's like it's sort of communist in a way, you know, you get paid very little. He worked very hard. Everything is for company. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:28:31       You know, it's really kind of weird. Yeah. Well America has a a strange relationship with that sort of collectivism when you think about it that way. Like it has to probably be that way in order for you to function together. A soldier's. Yeah. I mean, I don't think you, I don't think you really want a unit where everyone's constantly questioning orders and you know, like, no, I mean, as much as we kind of placed value on that, like, you know, it's good to think for yourself and it's good to question things. Um, if you're trying to be an effective military, it's, it's, that's not what's good. What's good is you do what your fucking told. Exactly. So that's probably why they use 18 year olds to begin with. But the problem is, you know, even if we're going to accept the reality that that's how it has to be, there has to be more oversight about where are we going to send these people?

Speaker 2:          01:29:16       What reasons have to be in place for us to send these people. And you know, we're, we're still at, now that we're still in Iraq, we're still in Afghanistan. Obama during his presidency, bombed a seven countries with drone strikes. Uh, by the way, I don't know if you've ever seen the, the report that like 90% of drone strikes didn't kill their intended targets, 90% civilian casualties. Yeah. Uh, you know, so, uh, terribly ineffectual. Like why our country is like spreading bad will across the world, especially in the Middle East, which is like a hotbed of fucking crazy fucks anyway. Just doing it that way in general robots flying from the sky. Oh look, you got, you gotta make sure those things work. Like if you're going to just, you can't be that off where you're killing. I mean it was, it's in the high 80%, wasn't it last time we checked with the, uh, the civilian casualty rate was unintended casualties for drone strikes and you know, like if you have any weapon that has like 10% effectiveness at killing its target, you know, like that's not a good weapon.

Speaker 2:          01:30:19       That's a piece of shit. It's just w but we're like, yeah, yeah, but listen, this way we don't have to send soldiers and we just fly it in and we just shoot the missiles and we get the fuck out of there. Yeah, that's really what I'm saying. I can see the appeal of that, but make sure the technology is there and in a way it might be like the most racist way to kill people. Yeah. We're not even willing a whisk at risk our own lives to kill you. We're just going to kill you from afar. And we were not as concerned about killing civilians because no one's, they're doing it cause we're all the way in Nevada with a fucking xbox controller. Yeah. And everyone were killing is just some, some brown Muslim people. So it's okay. Okay. Nearly 90% of the people killed in airstrikes were not the intended targets, you know.

Speaker 2:          01:31:01       And some of these still might have been bad people. I mean they're hanging around with fucking, you know, or they might have Eris and shit. Some of them were, I mean we saw in the Yemen raid a, the plenty of those victims were kids. Is there footage of a drone like watching a drone shoot down something is there, I want to see what it looks like. See if you could pull up a video. Is it from the drones point of view or is it, it is people seeing the, usually, usually you'll see it from the drone perspective. I would like to see what it looks like. Like a drone launch. Something like if you were on the ground, you saw a drone launch, something in the distance. Here we go. Just, yeah, that's what it usually is like. So dehumanized, boom, boom, boom, boom. You're dead insane too. I mean, the way it just, some dudes walking down the street and then the Ambo Book, look at that guy. He's moved. Oh my God. You imagine that just walking down the street due to due to do, boom. You're dead. Fucking fiery. Fire ball of death consumes you instantly.

Speaker 2:          01:32:05       Oh Man. Incinerated off the face of the fucking earth. Well, that Wiki leaks one, the first one.

Speaker 3:          01:32:15       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:32:16       Um, yeah. You see, I'm trying to get away and shit. Collateral murder. Remember they call it the collateral murder. Yeah. Put that video out and you got to see like how they're reacting to gutting these people down the street and they find out it's the wrong people. Yeah. It's like, whoops. Yeah. Like, wow. And that this got out and it shouldn't have gotten out. You know, that's the, that was the big wikileaks rub. Right. They shouldn't have released that. We shouldn't know. Yeah. We shouldn't know when our tax dollars fund, uh, the murder of civilians, the accidental unintended murder of a guy with a camera that you thought was a gun yet. But when you, when you, when you see this statistic that 90% of these strikes are killing the wrong people. I mean, you know, I mean like, it's happening all the time, but isn't it crazy how shit their optics are that they can't tell the difference between a rifle and a camera at distance?

Speaker 2:          01:33:08       Yeah. And it's not even just the optics to is just bits is bad intelligence. Like they'll, they'll just, because they don't have to actually risk any troops. Yeah. They'll just be like, someone says like, yeah, I think he's at this house. Oh, okay. Boom, boom, boom. Yeah, that's true. Right. If they were on the ground, they wouldn't treat it that way. If they were on the ground and we saw people on the ground, they were walking down the street and they saw the photographer with the, with the camera, they probably wouldn't treat it and it does. No Way. They would just open fire and gun everybody down as soon as they saw the people. Yeah. So you just, you just gone everybody down that you run into on your way to the bad guys. It bad guys. But when it, when it's, when you have that level of detachment where it's like, oh, this is like a fucking video game.

Speaker 2:          01:33:45       Oops, I killed some, uh, I killed some civilians. Okay, well the ducks and points from the scoreboard. Yeah, because if you were on the ground and the same thing happened, wouldn't you be judged differently? Like if you are on the ground and you are moving down the street and you saw a bunch of people in front of you and one guy had a camera and you just gun them all down, the women, the kids, everybody in front of them. Yeah. And you're like, well, you know, hey, they shouldn't have been out here with their kids. And uh, I didn't think that was the camera. Well, that's essentially, is that exactly what the guy said from the helicopter, right? Yeah, but it's different. It's because there's a level of detachment. There's that wall of separation, that wall of separation. It's kind of fucked. Oh, it's terrible.

Speaker 2:          01:34:22       It's scary. 90%. 90. So let's just keep doing it that way then. For sure. We're going to, there's nothing we can do about it. Uh, look at it. This is what I'm, what I'm, when I went, when I talk about that, when I talk about this, when I talk about the collusion between the Democrats and the Republicans, this is the kind of shit I'm talking about. This doesn't stop military stuff. Yeah. Like, yeah, this stuff doesn't seem to stop. Whether it's D or R, right? This military, this American Empire that we're trying to maintain across the globe, that keeps happening. That's actually a very good point because that stays consistent. And the battle over transgender bathrooms take front page of the news and then the, but the war aspect of it stays consistent. The drone aspects days consistent. If it doesn't ramp up and it looks like it's ramping up a little bit with trump.

Speaker 2:          01:35:10       Right. Maybe. I think that remains to be seen. Yeah, it does. It, Obama's been pretty, Obama Obama was pretty bad about it. I mean he was extremely violent. Uh, drone strikes increased under him. And that's some of that's just because the technology improved. Well, there's a lot of things about him that were so confusing. The drone strikes is just one of them. How about the attacks on whistleblowers? Like whatever happened and what you said in your shit like yet that hope and change website, like the whole thing was going to give an offer protection to whistle blowers. Well, you have like one of the biggest whistle blowers in the history of the world. Yet the idea of transparency to that was like a big thing. He transparency, transparency, but then you prosecute whistleblowers who revealed the gay illegal activities of the government. That's why when trump was like, he wiretapped trump tower.

Speaker 2:          01:35:53       I'm like, so what he wiretapped America, the NSA was instill is like just gathering everyone's text messages. Everyone's phone calls, archiving that shit in a big server somewhere. So it hasn't, how's he walked that back though? Hasn't he said now that he doesn't think that it was a wire tap that it was mike something else. Yeah, sure. But the point is that all the, all the phones are fucking tapped course. So what does it matter? Yeah. That information is already there. And you know, the, the crazy thing is that not only is it there for those agencies, but it's there for anyone who can hack into those agencies to get, and you know, if the cio at the, the, the, uh, the NSA developed it, the CIA, we now know, has its own version of it. I wonder how many private companies have their own version of this fucking server.

Speaker 2:          01:36:42       Yeah. When we found out that the CIA has their own version of it, everybody was like, well, what them to done, todd? Well, they're even worse than the NSA. So how would you know? Well, I mean, I guess I can't, I guess I can't say with certainty they're worse, but the NSA has never been involved as far as I know, in toppling the democratically elected leaders of other countries and installing puppets that are good for American business interests. So the CIA has, yes. Numerous times. Yeah. The, the idea of them all being able to listen to anybody's telephone calls were regardless of whether or not you're a terrorist, regardless of whether or not you're a felon, regardless of whether or not he was the nicest person of all time, they're like, Yep, let me just check. Yep. You're still the nicest guy of all time.

Speaker 2:          01:37:29       And they're using it for, uh, I mean, it's not just being used for terrorism. Me, they're using it for, there's through their drug war as well. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's, um, the drug war is going to have to ramp up if this marijuana legalization keeps kicking in, they're going to have to figure out some other way to arrest people. They have to keep the same jobs. I mean, they have a lot of jobs. They're going to have to justify, I mean, jeff sessions could come to the pot shops like where I live and uh, I guess there's pot shops around here too and uh, and they could fucking

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       read them. They could shut them down. Yeah, they could legally, yeah. They're the, because it's still illegal under federal law. Obama chose not to do that. He chose her respect the will of the states, but the trump administration has at least signaling that it's not going to because of sessions. You think because of a point. I don't think it's just because of sessions. I think sessions is where he is partially because they want to do this crackdown. Hmm. That's interesting. You might be right. We'll have to find out about that, but the crackdown is not going to go well. It's a terrible idea. You let the genie out of the bottle, you gave people their freedom. That will be the, that'll be the death of a, of the power of the trump administration. If they actually go through with something so stupid. It would be stupid economically as well.

Speaker 4:          01:38:37       Oh yeah. It would show. I mean, you want to talk about transparency, it will show really clearly who your loyalty is to that it's not to the will of the people that it's to these companies that are benefiting from keeping marijuana illegal. Period. That's it. And then we'd have to figure out a marijuana coalition. We've, we've got to figure out a way, like there are fucking 100 million of us. I guarantee you in this country, 100 million people that smoked pot. That's a lot of fucking people and that number's going to grow a third of the country. It's, yeah. And it's going to grow. The more things are people are

Speaker 5:          01:39:10       jubilee room. Really believe you fucking idiot. You fucking point.

Speaker 4:          01:39:18       There's a lot of fucking people. I might've made that number up. I fucking, uh, I mean, I believe it. I believe it's probably at least close because even when I was living down south and I was hanging out with conservatives who love trump, they smoked a little weed, smoking weed, not a little weed. They're smoking weed like crazy. It's fun. It's fun to get high. There's nothing wrong with it. The only thing that's wrong with it is the fact that it's been buttoned down into our brain, deep, deep in our memory through propaganda that it's bad for you. That's it. Yeah. If you looked at the actual effects it has on you, like we were talking about schizophrenia and blaming marijuana on schizophrenia, but it still seems across the board it'd be 1% it's the same thing with dummies and lazy people. When dummies and lazy people find out about pot, it ruins the idea of it for other people.

Speaker 4:          01:40:01       Oh, well look, it's associated with his loud mouth dummy. His loud mouth, fucking lazy person never gets anything done. He's always broke. So I was asking for money. That's a pothead. Potheads don't get shit done. Don't be a pothead. And then you get that in your head and you're just run with it. Well, there's plenty of men. We know there's plenty of potheads that are really industrious and hardworking. You know a lot of them, you can't attribute something that was always part of someone's personality and say, well, marijuana cause that. Exactly. It doesn't totally change the nature of a person. It's not that powerful of a fucking drug. Nor does coffee. No. Nor does alcohol nor do cigarettes for that matter. Exactly. Well, alcohol can change some people. That's true. It was bad example. Canada justice system is crumbling as cannabis rates continue. So, um, there've been, there had been busted all these fucking pot places.

Speaker 4:          01:40:48       I thought you guys had your social justice warrior president and uh, everybody was going to get to pick their own gender pronouns and now you're aerating pot places. Kaloga this 6,500 cases in provincial court could be soon drop due to delays including 38 for homicide or attempted murderer. One terrible case last year, a man named Kenneth Williamson was convicted of raping a minor over a hundred times. But because of lengthly delays and taking his truck, his case to trial, his conviction was overturned. Wait, is that so they could prosecute more marijuana? No, this is just saying that they are there. They're there. They're system is in such crisis and this marijuana case where they're arresting all these people from marijuana, it's insane because their justice system is already in the crisis. So it says, considering the justice system crisis, cannabis should obviously be the lowest priority for police and the courts, but it's not, not only your police launching more raids against suspensory than ever before, but ridiculous charges for small scale cannabis crimes are con continuing from coast to coast.

Speaker 4:          01:41:53       So they, they have a justice system that's so broken that they can't even convict people who raped miners a hundred times. They can't take them to trial. I mean there is there, but it's that broken. But they're still trying to fucking catch people for a smoking weed and, and just a rating dispensary's and Shit. Like if I had to get a waste of fucking time, if I had to guess, I would say it's some sort of compartmentalism and that like the drug people aren't, they don't go after the other crimes and they don't have to do with it, you know? And then there's a legal system that's backed up, but to put more people into the legal system, just because you have to somehow or another justify the position that you're in a cop of, of a dea cop, whatever they're called up there, that's fucking crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:42:38       You got a broken system. You have, uh, you're, you're preying on people. You're locking people up. Yeah. You mean if you, if you want to impress us then convict that fucking a rapist. Don't, yeah. Don't fucking, uh, prosecute people who are smoking weed for sure. And by the way, what you're doing right now seems like a crime. You're, you're locking people up in a cage for a plant that everybody on the planet knows is not bad for you. So if you just decide that because of some fucking bullshit thing that's written on paper, that you should be able to go against all the science that's available today. All the common sense and the will of the people. And you should be able to go into people's houses, going to people's businesses, arrest them, take all their money, take all their pot. That's a crime. That sounds like a crime.

Speaker 4:          01:43:19       It sounds like you're using your position and you're using it to just mark one up on the scoreboard. You know, we got some convictions today. Good solid ones. Bunch of dopers caught us. A bunch of dopers had to let that crazy pedophile go, but we got all the dopay. It dopers real scourge of society to a hundred kids. But you know what? He didn't, he didn't fuck them over by giving him pot. Yeah. Casey wasn't smoking no weed. It's those kids are going to remember what he did to them. It's not going to damage their memory. Yeah, I remember it. So you remember it explicitly? Jesus Christ. It's just, I can't believe that in this day and age that shit is still going on. It just seems like, and Canada, I thought with this Trudeau guy was going to be more progressive than ever, which Canadians are complaining about it like crazy and you know, I've had Jordan Peterson on the podcast and he hates what's going on now with this push towards being as open minded as possible with all these accepting of the gender pronouns and that you're going to have to start putting people, uh, you're going to have to start processing cases through the human rights council because if you don't use a person's proper gender pronoun, it could literally be considered a crime.

Speaker 4:          01:44:34       Like I think all that stuff on the left when it goes way far, it gets really crazy, but it's probably a good thing to balance out the stuff on the right and people figure out some sort of comfortable medium that he's not being that at all. He's not, if you, if the president is allowing this to go on, he's not being this progressive president. He's just not, if he's only going to be progressive towards Trans Gender Pronouns and whatever other ridiculous laws that they're swamped with. This is, this is just a terrible precedent to set. Allowing them to lock people up for pot in 2017 is a fucking criminal waste of resources, a criminal waste of manpower, uh, criminal, uh, criminal intrusion on the freedom of those people that you're locking up a criminal on the disruption that you're putting into their lives and the money that you're taking away from them for, for trading out your economy as well.

Speaker 4:          01:45:28       Yes. And fucking your economy up and these people were trading in something that is very valuable to the community and to the human beings that consume it. Yeah. You know, I'm a, I consider myself probably more liberal than I am conservative, but when I see the priorities of liberals being identity, politics, shit, gender pronouns and stuff, and then so much of the real issues like just get ignored like this. Yeah. Uh, that makes me hesitant to even say like, I'm a liberal or I'm more left wing and right wing or whatever because I'm just like, you're, your priorities are totally fucked. They're totally out of order. Uh, you know, apparently in Canada they're fighting all these fucking politically correct identity politics battles, but they can't deal with the pot issue. They're gonna their police raids against pot dispensaries are actually up and they're trying to charge people with petty fucking weed, smoking crimes.

Speaker 4:          01:46:25       And this is a thing that people always go on about. Like it's because it's pot, it seems like it's not a big issue. It's like it's not, we've got bigger fish to fry. Yeah. When you look at Tj, okay. I don't know if you've been paying attention to the stock market. Okay. Dj, you know what the war in Afghanistan, Tj, yeah. Okay, we've got problems. Real problems. I was fucking pop thing. You got damn potheads if it's off for your pot, oh, what do I do? Whatever. But it's not that this what people have to realize, it's about personal freedom. It's about a person telling you what you can do and enforcing it to the point of putting you in a fucking cage. And that thing, which had been an accepted part of civilization for thousands of years and is today accepted. It's an accepted part of civilization, civilization right now.

Speaker 4:          01:47:09       But there's just these people that don't engage in it, that don't understand it, and that feel like they have the right to go and lock people up for it. You know, when the trump administration started signaling that they were going to, uh, take on weed or that they were thinking about it, at least that it was on the table, like stupid at that point, I was, I made a video where I was, I was basically, it was like making all the cases why this is terrible. This is a bad idea. Uh, you know, the, I made the economics argument, I made the personal freedom argument. Um, I may, I, you know, I pointed out the tremendous amount of revenue this is generating for the states that have legalized it. And a huge part of the response was just like, yeah, oh yeah, of course. He goes after trump when trump goes after his precious weed, when he cares.

Speaker 4:          01:47:58       That's the only thing that got them to care. It's like fucking junkie. I made fucking so many cogent arguments that hold water about the economic and personal liberty ramifications of something like this. And all you want to focus on is my personal usage of this fucking substance. It's bullshit. You Bet. It's a good thing to talk about cause it'll get you talking about it like right now. It'll get ya. It'll poke coucher they know because they know that people like you and I really do enjoy our marijuana. And when you tried to take away the pot, we really do get upset. Yeah. I mean it was like kind of the like I was kind of like on the give trump a chance bandwagon until they started signaling this stuff. So that's why it really why I got shit. It's a very, very foolish thing to try to step in in 2017 with all the signs and all the information and the public opinion and to say that marijuana is something that can get you locked up, get you locked up, but it's almost as bad as heroin.

Speaker 4:          01:48:52       He's so stupid. That's a silly man. That guy needs a pot Brownie more than anything in this life. He just needs a just a quarter. Just give them a quarter. Let him sit there and let him think about his grandchildren and let them think about fishing and let them think about just napping in the sun and going to meet the good Lord in a few years. You don't have much time left, motherfucker. You want to ruin it for potheads. You're barely alive. Your hair's white, your posture's bad, and you're standing there lying. You're lying on television about heroin and pot being like really close. That's a crazy person who doesn't know what pot does. You're talking about pot. You obviously have no idea what it's like. It's like a person who's colorblind describing some sort of a kaleidoscope. You don't know what you're even talking about. Like for a guy like him, if you want to have a person who's talking about individual experiences, they should have had, like if you're talking about someone who's talking about the effects of a chemical and whether or not it should be, they should have had some sort of experience with that chemical.

Speaker 4:          01:49:51       They should know what it's doing. They should understand it, especially if it's safe. Something like marijuana. So if you to talk about it and to have these ridiculous, you, you can't, you can invest one evening in a safe environment. They'll do it in a laboratory or a hospital somewhere. Pat Up the rooms and give you a pod cookie and then put, put pink Floyd's the wall on just someone, someone tell this fucking guy what it really is. Cause he's just talking out of his ass. Yeah, I mean, uh, I don't know if this is just apocryphal or if they're, this is an actual story, but I remember there being something about him saying that he thought the, the KKK, we're good guys until he found out they smoked weed. That was, uh, I think that was wrongly attributed to him and that not only that, there has been evidence that he's done many things for civil rights.

Speaker 4:          01:50:37       I had read that too, but I think that's, it just might be the case of people being overzealous and trying to paint a demean. You could find things, I'm sure that you've said or that I've started to take them completely out of context. You could paint a very different opinion. Definitely. It's fucking very hard to form an opinion of someone, like a legitimate opinion if someone without actually knowing them, but you can have an opinion. It's not that hard when they call and say that, uh, that pod is nearly as dangerous as heroin because then you did that person at that point you're just like, this person is either delusional or is willfully deceptive. Right. And the important part about it is it's not just a person. It's a person with an extreme amount of power. Yeah. It's a person, a very dangerous position of enforcing laws and you go, okay, well will you think that that's crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:51:21       That's not true. That's not true. Like, I just drives me nuts because I think it helps people. I really don't. I really do. I really do think it's probably one of the best elements in terms of uh, a happy, healthy society. Staying grounded and being like a little more kind. I give, I think it gives you a certain percentage more of kindness. Yeah. I mean, uh, I've definitely seen it make people more empathetic, more tolerant towards one another. I've seen people who have anxiety that it helps. I've seen people who have anxiety that it exacerbates their anxiety to the edibles. You're sure? Like with a story I told about my brother at the beginning of show, but for the, for the, by and large, I know a lot of people with like bad anxiety who smoke weed and it makes them feel better. It makes them feel more comfortable in social situations.

Speaker 4:          01:52:09       Um, stuff like that too, bro. It makes you fucking talk about weed. Yeah. How come you guys keep talking about wheat? I get it. You like weed enough already, Bro. I can read that. No could read it in the comments there. It's already there. So much typing and stop talking about. We get 'em. I'm going to get, I know tj reads these motherfucker. I'm going to get them. Don't talk about this. Talk about this instead. Suck it. Feel the burn you motherfucker. Well, if you don't want us to talk about weed, then tell jeff sessions to stop a signaling. He's going after it. Jeff sessions needs to get high on mushrooms to get that guy in a nice room with Velvet curtains and gentle Jefferson airplane from the 1960s real low candlelight. Put some black light posters on the wall. You don't need that. You need, and he's a black light.

Speaker 4:          01:52:55       I want it to just, I want him to just sit there and stare at a poster and watch it change shapes and colors a bunch of times and like, whoa. Yeah. You know what? We do do black light posters areas, but only only, uh, it's hard to imagine that fucker on shrooms. No, it's not easy. I see him wearing like an African garb. Oh. Like some sort of macrame beads around his neck and shit, but all the posters on the wall, they're all that Bruce Lee poster from enter the dragon with a blood across his chest. That's the greatest velvet poster of all time. That's the ultimate trailer Park Kung Fu master poster. Oh yeah. I have that mother fucker up. Have him watch that. Watch all the things that turns into, yeah, poor old guy. It's going to go to his grave without trying mushrooms. It's going to go to his grave thinking we'd is as bad as heroin.

Speaker 4:          01:53:43       Maybe. Uh, maybe he took mushrooms and that was the revelation he had. Wow. Marijuana is almost as bad as heroin is so stupid because it doesn't kill you and it's actually better for a lot of people for pain than even heroin is. Especially edible pot. Edible pod is supposed to be really good for people that have chronic pain, stump, massive producer of information, but you can function on it like it is. Especially physiologically. You can function. Like if you do something you already know how to do and you're a, you're high on pot, especially edibles. It doesn't have any like performance, uh, like decreasing elements to it. It doesn't, doesn't decrease your performance. In fact, a lot of people do it right before they do Jujitsu cause they think it increases their performance zone. Where I've known people who get high before they go work out because they're like, yeah, you know, it's going to keep me more focused and you know, especially if you're smoking like a strong sativa strain, it might give him a little energy burst.

Speaker 4:          01:54:38       Yeah. You feel it man. It feels like the fibers of your muscles. It's great. Before Yoga. Oh yeah. I mean I, I don't really do a lot of like physical activities that much, but like if I'm going to do like stretching or something, it's nice to be high and just like, oh yeah. Cause the best your muscles are way more relaxed and stuff. You're able to get your, you have like flexibility. You don't really have, if you're just stone cold sober and all your tension is still there and it feels really good. Like when you're stretching, you're high, it feels like, oh you're supposed to be doing this. You should do this more often dude. Like you just have a better accounting of what the signals your body sending you. Cause I think when you're, when you're sober, you know you can try to think about all your different areas and tune into the body and all the various points of contact where the elbows meet the forearm and think about all the muscle tissue. But you'd have to like really go through it like step by step and be really conscious of what you're doing when you smoke pot. It's just there. I really enjoyed watching you fight with a steven crowder about this by the way. Oh he's a silly boy when it comes to pot. He's a silly boy overall. I've had some

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       dealings with him. The pop thing is interesting though cause he didn't want to even debate it. Like when we were pulling up the information he thought it was being a bully because we were pulling up things. It showed a contrary to what he was saying about car accidents. I've since looked into it and the American Automobile Association has some statistics where they think that it's increasing. There's an increased number of people that have marijuana in their system, but the, when they have the car accidents. But the real problem with that is there might be just as much of an increase in those people smoking marijuana in that area. It might not be related to the accident. Just because it's connected to the accident doesn't mean it caused the accident. Car accident argument too. Like, you know, you got to realize alcohol is causing way more traffic accidents than, than weed is.

Speaker 2:          01:56:29       That was what they were talking about. There's, in these places, there's a lot of the places where people were smoking pot. There's a decrease, a decrease in Dui fatalities. There's a decrease in violent crimes. There's quite a few different statistics to look at, but Colorado seems to be saying there's a decrease in these car accidents and in, um, Dui related incidents. You know, Steven crowder wanted to sue me too. Why do you want to tell you he wanted to see me? We were on the same, uh, network for a while on Youtube and it was called poly pop. And the guy that was like my assigned, I forget what the position is called, the, the fucking facilitator or whatever the fuck he had the same one as I did. And he told me, you know, uh, that video you made about Steven crowder and that, that shit, cause he got in a fight with some union guy on footage and he was like, I was attacked by this union thug and I punched him.

Speaker 2:          01:57:21       I looked at the footage and I'm like, wait a minute, this guy gets up from the ground. He's facing away from you. It looked like someone pushed him from behind because you see the whole video. Yeah, the beginning of it. The guy threw a punch at him. Well the guy was on the fucking ground. Uh, one point. Yeah, like, but he's, he, you don't really see what happens with them when you see, you see the guy throw a punch at him first. I'm very familiar with the video. I don't, I don't know. I don't, I don't, I looked at it, I did the guys in his face. Can we, can we maybe see the guys in his face? The guy comes close to him to get into some sort of a grappling situation with a guy like physically manhandled them. I hold, hold on. This is on crowder's channel.

Speaker 2:          01:57:59       I want to see the, there's like an un uh, anelle edited version of this somewhere, but it's, you could see the full education when it does happen. It's taken even on crowder's channel. Go scroll ahead a little bit. I want to get to a, I'll tell you what, that's the guy that's the guy that gets the guy that hits him. Oh wait, it's the guy's telling him to back the fuck up. So he puts his hands and hold on that, that's the guy that fights and right there, the guy with the mustache, which guy the mustache did and you see this guy. Okay. You see that? Like we don't, there's like a missing piece of footage there, but in the footage I saw the, you don't see that guy attack him first. You see that guy get up from being on the ground on his stomach.

Speaker 2:          01:58:39       I see what you're saying. So something, so when I was thinking is through the guy that gets steven crowder pushed this guy, I don't know, cause you don't, there's no, there's no footage on there. But I, I surmised based on what I looked at in the footage that this guy was maybe pushed and then got up and then started wailing on crowder. Hmm. Interesting. And I put that out there and here's the interesting thing. He said he was gonna sue me for what I said about it. Uh, he then later went to court and a judge looked at the footage and kind of came to the same conclusion I did and said, I don't think that this went down the way you're saying based on the footage. I see. He lost that court case and then he had to drop any sort of idea of a lawsuit against me because the judge had already ruled that the tape was bullshit.

Speaker 2:          01:59:20       Didn't really show what he thought it said shed. This is also instances where I challenged him to debates back in the day, not recently, but he would never acknowledge me. I mean at one time he did send his like little brother after me. His brother? Yeah. Like I don't know if it was his younger brother, his older brother, I think it was his little brother was like, you're a fucking faggot or whatever. I'm like, why won't your brother debate me? Cause we were at the time on the Seine, that word you're saying he sent them after you physically? No, no, just on twitter. Oh, okay. You got to get best five. Sorry. Two dudes are looking at each other outside of Barr. He didn't come. He didn't come and try to fucking fuck me up or anything. He just talking shit on twitter and they talk shit on twitter.

Speaker 2:          01:59:56       You're sure that Steven's brother. It was okay. Yeah, it was steven's brother. But um, but Stephen himself has never taught. I made several videos about him. Maybe not several like three. Mm. Uh, but he's never confronted me. Polyprop tried to get us to do a debate at the time he wouldn't do it. That seems when it's weird because like he's mister like, I'm going to go like, he just trolled Janky yogurt the other day, you know, it was, I thought that was funny. His, his impression of Janky Yoga is fucking fun. It is pretty spot on. The one that he did where he played Anna and junk back and forth. I didn't see that. Oh fuck it. Pull it up. He'll let us use it. But I like Steven crowder. I do. I really do. I think he's a good guy. I just, you know, he's like, he's a little bit heavy on the right wing. He gets a little silly, but he does some funny shit like this. And when he crashed genx thing, like with this, the saddest thing was how Jank was responding to it. Like he, he didn't have any sense of humor about it. Uh, well Jank obviously takes himself very seriously for some reason.

Speaker 6:          02:00:56       Do the research. That's absolutely correct. You will have it listed a Goc I agree with you. Cenk so much. That's absolutely right. When you use the f word, you know, it's real time. So we have a bunch of people anyway.

Speaker 2:          02:01:12       You could see it online at one point. He's porn bacon, grease down his mouth. I just thought it was funny. It was pretty fine. It's, it's, look, dude, I reached out to be able to make fun of yourself. I recently sat down, uh, we did this. We went and watched a bunch of young Turks videos so we could put out this special drunken peasants versus the young Turks. A video. We, we shot about five hours of us watching young Turks videos and just tearing them apart. And one

Speaker 1:          02:01:39       of the things I noticed is what Jank we'll do [inaudible] and watch for this. If you ever watch an his shit, uh, he'll have his panel say something that's like super crazy left wing. Like someone will say it, like animal, say it or one of the Steven O or whatever. Whoever got on Ben, make a wits, whatever. They'll say something that's real far left wing and then it'll cut to Janke and Jank. We'll have more of like a, a moderate left wing opinion and then it'll go back to them and they'll immediately capitulate to Jank like, oh yeah, Jank you're, you're, you're, what you're saying is way more sensible than what I said a second ago. And I just saw that pattern recurring over and over and over again. So I don't know if that's like by design or if they're just, they feel like the need to capitulate to him because there they'd be scared of him or something, you know, or uh, or what it was definitely a lot of emotion.

Speaker 4:          02:02:30       What's going on there too. There's a lot of emotion in the way they describe things and some people I think at least initially connected to that, but then they see where it gets problematic. If you're dealing with any like really serious issue and you want to debate just the facts like and have your ducks in a row,

Speaker 1:          02:02:47       the wool, the wool over my eyes was the Harris debate because think most people, exactly. That was like the first like major chink in the chank ugur armor.

Speaker 4:          02:02:57       I never know how to pronounce his first name. So when you said it that way, I was like you, you kind of think it's been changing Cenk in the Jank you've Cenk in the Jank. Yeah, there we go. I think he's a good guy. I liked talking to him too. I just think people handle certain types of confrontation and disagreements. Um, and they don't handle the best way they could. And then those things escalate and they compound and then it becomes who you are and then you defending who you are and then you're always trying to argue with people about who you are and what you've done. And like that's when you're gone. Yeah. It's when you're over the top, it's like we've done that, we've done that and we've done this, we've done that. Like, Hey, you're talking about shit that's happening in the world.

Speaker 4:          02:03:36       That's all you're doing. That's all any of us are doing. That's all anybody's doing it. Unless you're out there digging wells in the Congo with Justin wren, what you're doing is you're talking about shit. So if you got a bunch of people listening to you talk about shit, it's just talking about shit. The end of the day you don't get any extra points because more people are listening or more people are watching. Your point isn't more valid. Your point still has to stand up in the marketplace of ideas. Yeah. And yours is just as valid as his is just as valid as mine. It just, if the delivery system is a bigger delivery system, it doesn't mean that like everybody has to stop. I'd take you into account because you've had more success in this market. That's a crazy way of looking at shit. Sure. And when him and Alex Jones battle back and forth between who gets the most viewers and who has the model like, Holy Shit, this is ridiculous. Like what, when did you see when Alex went onto the stage at south by southwest? Is that what it was south by southwest? I think so, yeah. Last year. It's hilarious. Oh yeah. That was the, was one of the greatest, uh,

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       uh, trollings of all time. But it, jen got so mad. I was furious. And then dumb ass that little, they oppose Saudi Arabia, little weasel, Jimmy Dore spitting on that. So unfortunately Alex Jones did. You know, it's unfortunate that Guy Jimmy Dore does some good stuff. Yeah, I've seen some of his stuff too. This is a really good to put some really good videos up. He, he's done some really good work. Yeah. I can't keep them. I don't really care for him. But um, but, but you recognize that some of this stuff's really good, right? I've never seen this stuff. That's good. And maybe, maybe, maybe it's out there. I haven't seen it. I've seen it makes some good points. Very good points. Uh, you know, he, when he was covering the whole Milo thing, he played a very deceptive version of the Milo clip and he credited us basically as a podcast.

Speaker 2:          02:05:25       And one that's talked about us is like, we're doing this podcast from a basement somewhere or something. Meanwhile, isn't it funny that a podcast like yours, which gets hundreds of thousands of downloads, I'm sure, right? Like you, if it was more than that, he would have to say the name of the podcast. Right. Like if he was, he was on the Adam Carolla show, he would say the Adam Carolla show. Sure. Cause it's yours. Even though he knows what it's like, like I'm not going to give these guys now. And you know, a lot of the media did that to us. I was, I was a, there was like transcripts of the Milo episode where it was like, and then unknown host said this, it's like, fuck you, I'm not in a bunker whites. You guys can't just look it up. Aren't you supposed to be like journalists? Can't you figure out what the fuck the podcast was?

Speaker 2:          02:06:09       And I saw ones that attributed, um, stuff to me, but then had stuff of yours where they didn't even, I didn't even know that you guys had him on. I thought that all the shit was coming from my podcast because I got a text message from my friend Chris Mcguire informing me of all of it. And so I went and I said, well, this isn't even my podcast. And then I realized like, oh, he was on your podcast too. And they combined the two different things. I even saw people say like, he was on Joe Rogan's drunken peasants podcast. It's like, wow, people are supposed to trust you for fucking information. You're supposed to be a fucking credible source. You can't even get this basic shit. Right. So the media is a fucking joke. Well, the media now is, it's total fucking joke. He's like a few places we could still trust. Like where? Um, I'm hoping you were on the answer because you know what? People come to me all the time and they're like, Tj, what news media outlet do you trust? I'm like, none of them. I don't trust a single God damn fucking thing. Any of these institutions have to say whatever Megan Kelly has to say. I'm listening. I'm Megan, I'm in. Hey again. You're right about everything, man. It a lot. That's what I like. Like ice princesses. Yeah. I don't know why. Like a main like Amina and smart, really?

Speaker 2:          02:07:26       Not really. No. I'm like, no, but I'm fascinated by people who must, you know, some people, you know, they're perfect structure, perfect bone structure, steely blue eyes and peck will be dressed, talking about guns and the war and crime and poverty and pot and prison. We'll be right back. You know the fucking bitch I really hated back in the day was a nancy grace. Oh, she's the worst. She's hideous. Stole the worst. She's horrible. And like that, that moral indignation that she has over everything. Like everything is always like, yeah, oh my God, I cannot believe. You know. I hate that. I hope that constant, I'm indignant about everything in the world and I'm this great moral judge here to fucking tell people what's really what another dead baby in Florida. Oh, she's a monster. Remember when she went up to those Duke Lacrosse kids? Yep.

Speaker 2:          02:08:18       The fake rape case and then never apologized. Now why would she? She's perfect. In fact, she's probably still thinks those kids did it. Imagine that. Imagine, imagine being those kids and go home. What in the fuck we didn't do that. Oh, Nancy grace. Show up. Nancy grace. That's not the truth. Those boys are terrible. She's made her entire career off of like exploiting the worst human beings and their worst case scenarios and then putting it on tv and getting everybody outraged. Yup. [inaudible] machine hot mom. She was the one who was chasing that lady down that killed her kid. Casey Anthony. Remember that? That was, that was her big bloodhound moment. Nancy Grace Review renews her criticism of Taught Mom. Who the fuck is Tottenham renewing? She's that lady that killed her kid. Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh, so it's Casey and Casey Anthony. I didn't, I've never heard her called tot mom before.

Speaker 2:          02:09:18       Yeah, that's who she calls her or taught mom. I tried to avoid experiencing Nancy grace on any level. Did you ever see her debate with two chains? Now they debated about pot, two chainz and Nancy grace. We're debating about pod on TV. It was the most ridiculous shit ever. Two chains and that have actually seen that. Now that you mention it, why? Why they let two Chainz do it? Cause she probably thought he was a soft target that she could just row steamrolled in. Oh yeah. If you're going to do that with her, you'd need to be in the room too. You can't be on that split screen. They talk over. You could barely hear them. This delay, it's confusing. They know what the fuck they're doing. They'll split, scream. Things are weird. You have something in your ear and they're talking to them. You don't see them.

Speaker 2:          02:09:58       You're staring right at camera, dude. Yeah. Don't, when I wasn't looking at them and I was on CNN, like not only that, but like I was in a huge gigantic room and the camera was like 30 feet away, so I'm looking at this camera that's like in the distance, like talking and nothing it, there's a fucking earpiece in my ear that keeps falling out and it's designed that way, man. It's designed to, well, first of all for convenience for them, for the people that are filming. Yeah, but also like the best way to get a good reaction out of a, the guest is put the guests under pressure, put them on a press button and then some weird situation and have some smooth talking cukor Tucker Carlson type character. Oh Dude. Tucker Tucker, I'm really disappointed he didn't stick with the bow tie. I was hoping I am too, but you know what?

Speaker 2:          02:10:44       He seems like his ratings or better. So maybe the bow tie this fucking lot. But like I remember like, I love how every fucking answer anyone gives to him on his show. He always does this like, yeah. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Always has this like perplexed. Like what, yeah, he's an interesting guy. He's sort of taking this middleman republican approach, sort of the middle, you know, like more reasonable, more and more towards the middle will be, can I understand your position? Like, let me, let me go over your position one more time please. Like he's, he's, he's sort of semi mocking, but clearly on the right. Oh yeah. And uh, the, the great thing too is that he's kind of brought that, um, that Internet strain of conservatism over to Fox News. Cause like, you know, Bill O'reilly and Sean Hannity, they're not tapped into that shit. Right, right.

Speaker 2:          02:11:36       Bill Tucker is, yeah. And it's clear. Right, right, right. So He's, he's, he's basically appealing to, uh, probably a younger conservative demographic. I would imagine than than Hannity and a o'reilly get, he's appealing to the people that have seen one too many Alex Jones videos where they've gotten to that one point that like, I can't do this anymore. I can't do this anymore. And then they go over to Tucker. So what was it, what was it like having him having him on here by the way, Alex Jones, it was a dream come true. Like sit and face to face and listen to him talk. Well, I've been friends with them for a long time, right on that guy since 1999 I think it was fun. It was fun for me, but it was also something like for the longest time people thought I was avoiding having him on for some reason and he kept saying, well, I tried to get ahold of Joe Rogan every month, Tom and Tom, but he blows me off.

Speaker 2:          02:12:26       He was always texting the wrong number. He's always like, he didn't get worried. Get Ahold of me that day. And I'm like, dude, I already have a podcast schedule. I can't do it today. Well, I'll be back soon. One of my bag. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. And then he would go on. I show Joe Rogan's been avoiding me. I've been trying to get in there to give out this information is very important. Maybe scared, maybe he's been threatened. The government threatened him. He won't open up about bigfoot. I believe Joe Rogan did experience big foot. He saw he was there in the woods. Now Alex doesn't really believe in big foot. I guess. Who knows what he's got fries. I know he believed. He seems to believe in demons these days. Oh yeah. Well they are demons. They're all, they're all demons from hell. All of them. They're damned. They're damned. I'm sorry. And if you see red thing where he doesn't eat, you apologize. The apology, the apology compilation. Excuse me. It's amazing. I will stop your head. Excuse me. I've got to, that's just a Christian family show. It's like, what the hell? I am a Christian and I apologize. He's just such a fucking awesome guy to me. He's awesome. He's, he's like a boundless source of entertainment. And if you knew

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       him, man, like if you, me and him went out, we went to a bar, we had a couple of drinks, we would have a great fucking time. I'm telling you, he's a really nice guy. He's a real nice guy. And he would start telling you, well, the Barium, they'd been putting bury him in the water and you're like, what? You want another beer? Like it's, it's, I'm telling you he's a great guy, but I understand that people are upset that he has the president's ear and maybe the president is like me. Maybe the president just thinks he's awesome. Listen to crazy stories. I'm just like, yeah, Berryman. The water sounds great. Inner dimensional child molesters are coming in through the cigarette, smoke cigarettes with the 599 chemicals are designed to let the gates of hell come loose. Knit interdimensional child molesters come in and he just will go on and on and on.

Speaker 4:          02:14:14       I love the interdimensional child molester thing because it's like they have interdimensional travel capabilities and they're like immediate thing. Like what do we use this for? I know what's will kids will rape kids and other dimensions, you know, like what? Well there always is that really the best application of that fucking technology. They're always like the archetypes of like when you get into the really hard core conspiracy theorists, the heart, the archetypes are always like very satanic. The archetypes are always like a eugenics. Like they want to kill off a massive amount of the population. Um, engineering a master race, like, oh, there's all like keeping all the medicine and the resources for the elites killing off everyone else. Uh, preparing to get off this planet because they know it's doom cause Nibiru who's coming? It's all this like apocalyptic shit. It's really fascinating because it's like so much of it revolves around these, these like, and then they sell supplements and survival kits.

Speaker 4:          02:15:09       Well that's what he does. Nobody sells a better than Jim Baker. He sells them his furniture. He seen that video. He's selling his toilets. Dude. Have you seen him sell it? Like, you know, after he says after the bonus bucket is empty, you can use it as a toilet. Oh, so like when you're out there in the woods. Yeah. You know the modern plumbing after the apocalypse, people don't even know how bad shit smells. Cause most of the time you don't really smell it. You smell it. Water down, plop logs. When you, when you take a shit in the woods, that's when you really go, oh Jesus Christ. And at least then you're outside with all that air and a nice stiff breeze. But if you take a shit in a room, in a bucket, it's going to smell so horrible. You will start gagging and throwing up.

Speaker 4:          02:15:50       You'll be so disgusted. Not to mention you'd have to actually eat, they're supposedly fucking five years worth of disgusting macaroni and cheese or mashed potato. It was to actually get the bucket empty enough to shit in it. That's true. So I mean like look at that as Jim Beggar's bowl and look at all in any of these fucking old fucks gonna live long enough to even, they are, who cares if they survive the apocalypse? They're fucking probably not even going to survive this demo for fuck's sake. Well you don't know is we are all battening down the hatches and waiting for Jesus's return. Okay. The slop that was in the bucket and the slap, they're putting their mouths is not the same. Oh, you think there's different? It does not the same. There's just

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       like a rice pudding maybe. It looks like a fine risotto. It's a risk Soto. Yeah. Oh, look at those poor people in the audience. Forget about being so fucking stupid that you watch it on tv because it's just on. But imagine being so fucking stupid. Like you said, go to see the chairman today and take the bus into the town to go and sit in the audience and this in the past you're doomed. I think they offer them free food. I think they tell him like, yeah, you get a free meal if you come in here. That's all they need. A free meal. They're like, Ooh, sweet. Free food. All they probably excited to be on television as well. That's true. Books. They have books open. Pack that up. Look, but don't they have like books in their hands? Probably those same books you see on the stage.

Speaker 2:          02:17:11       Probably just passing them out. Get them to try to fucking buy this bonus bucket. Shit. Hey look, we've got like notes. People are taking notes. This is important stuff. What's important? Well, okay, if vile eat one played that Rojo would die. I could be underground for 50 years. I've got willpower. I got a wind shirt on. Look at these fucking people. They're taking notes. Like, this is like really important stuff that Jim Baker's talking about. I just loved this guy. Keeps on keeping on. Oh yeah. He's like the energizer bunny dude. Yeah. No one's talking to Jessica Hahn these days. Okay. Nobody even cares about her anymore. I look at him. He looks smooth as fuck. He's got that sleek white hair. I got a cute little beard. Look at him. He's thin. It looks healthy. Passionate. Yeah. He's got the drive. He's got the energy. It's got this hot little piece of ass behind him in the green shirt.

Speaker 2:          02:18:02       Yeah. Look at her. It's fun. Actually. If you watch this shit, sometimes you'll see them like, uh, openly argue on the show. But like, it'll be like very like, uh, restrained. Like I remember one time he was, he was like talking about marijuana or something and he's like, you used to smoke marijuana in your college days didn't change. She's like, Oh yeah. And then, you know, just picture a smoking pot and taking tech like a champ. Oh yeah. Right. I mean, uh, she, she does have that vibe, doesn't she? For sure on strong sure. Trophy wife vibe going on. Yeah. Especially for someone that guy's age. Well, we found out from the Jessica Hahn days, that dude was a party. He liked to party. That's his deal. He likes to talk about the Lord and he may be even believes it, but after that she has done woo, let's parties down to fuck.

Speaker 2:          02:18:49       Yeah. That's what Christianity Christianity's all about. Forgiveness. Y'All. Yeah. Listen man, I'm just get forgiven the next day. That's a beautiful thing. He's got a good market. He's got it locked in. Who's that? Joel Olsteen guys that his name? Yeah. Joel Olsteen. That guy. He does arenas, man. Oh, that guy. Just the same place where we do the UFC. He was coming the next day or the next week. I was like, that's crazy. He fills the fucking arena. Is that like prosperity doctrines shill? Look at homeless people. Maybe I'm in the wrong business. Yeah. I've thought about it before. I'm like, man, how much do I have to know about Jesus? Talk about him on stage. Not a whole lot. I was thinking like, oh, I could fucking spinned this yarn about like I used to be this, uh, youtube atheists. Yeah, dude, you should totally do that. And now all deemed and I found Jesus and Oh yeah, I'll just, I'll do it all nice and conservative and shit and, and I'll be like, yeah, I found Jesus turned my life around.

Speaker 2:          02:19:40       I was depressed. We'll stop right there. Stop right there. And no one's going to believe you. Change your fucking accent to a mocking southern accent. You know, obviously you can't do that for you, but let's, let's just run through how we would have you do it. Okay. If we're going to reinvent you, look, let's just say the company, the country, rather, move so far into conservatism. That is dangerous. Being an atheist is dangerous, being a liberal and you've got a certain amount of financial requirements. Now you've got a mortgage, you know, maybe you got a car payment. You're like, well fuck man, I need to get this money to keep coming in. I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to reinvent myself and there'll be a performance art piece I do for a few years or become a conservative. Come conservative Christian. Yeah. Give my life over to Jesus.

Speaker 2:          02:20:17       What would be the event that we would need to talk about? Like we'd have to describe an event that motivated you to make the big chain. Oh Shit. It had to be something that I could, I could fake easily, but it seems credible and believable. Like maybe a little baby heart attack. Oh yeah, that's true. Yeah. You're a little overweight. Yeah. Yeah. I guess it'd be like I had my heart attack and uh, I can't even fucking, maybe I could spend some kind of like near death yarn or some shit. Yeah. Yeah. Look, you blacked out. Like something happened yet to like a little minor heart attack and your legs stop working. You blacked out. And I saw it was in a tunnel and I saw the lights and I felt like a presence and an energy love that I'd never experienced before. What did, what did, what was your initial reaction to this love and this experience?

Speaker 2:          02:21:00       Oh, um hmm. I think, uh, she was, Lord, should we go the hell route? Should we go? Like I saw, you know, I was cast out of this place and I went to hell. Or is that too over the top? Here's my take on things. Yeah. This is what I believe. I believe you're allowed to talk about God all day long, but as soon as you talk about the devil, only a select group of people are going to hear you. That's true. If you talk about your cause more people believe in God and believing in the whole fuck. Yeah. Not only that, it's culturally acceptable to describe a belief in a higher power. And if you don't even say God, you get away with it. Like for 90% of the people. Oh yeah, that's true. All you have to do is say I'm spiritual, I'm nondenominational, but I'm spiritual.

Speaker 2:          02:21:41       And ultimately I believe in a higher power. I just think it's very possible that some, I, I leave the option areas like the seven planets fucking thing. Like what's that? They say? Uh, it's like a, it's like a reincarnation trope where you're like, you go through like seven stages of, of life where like the first year I think humans are like second or third on the list. But eventually, like in your seventh life, you become like a being of a, well, I mean it's not necessarily your seventh cause you're, you're, you're like repeatedly attempting you. So you become like an enlightened being. Yeah. Like if you're, if you're, if you're a shitty human being, you might get sent back or you might just be a human being again, but eventually you get reincarnated is like an immortal being of the pure enlightenment

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       and just did one with the cosmos and all that shit. I got Dalai Lama. Yeah, you could do like a, like a, you know, can you put the pedal that new age shit, right? Because they've, they like said it and I'm like seven different planets too. Like you go from one planet to the next as you progress up the ladder of fucking liars. This all of us. But what is this? What religion is this one? I don't know. It's just some crazy shit I heard one time, but I could roll with that seven planets. Yeah. You have seven times to re reinvent yourself and like totally. I'm totally, I have my shit together now. I'm 500 years old, but I'm totally together. Finally I can say I'm whole. Nope. Then you ascend. Then you're saying you send to enlightenment to the seventh planet where you live out the rest of your existence.

Speaker 4:          02:23:09       So in pure love and joy, if we just had you talking on CNN again and they would go, well, what, what inspired you to make this decision after all your years of atheism, youtube videos to become a Christian and now that you are a Christian, are you going to take those videos down? No, I'm going to leave them up so people can see that. I really was this atheist. I really did give credence to these atheist beliefs, but now I've, I've just, I've, I've rejected that all and in fact I'm going to go through all my old videos and rebut them and show where I was wrong and explain why I was wrong. So stay tuned for that. Oh, genius. I love it. And you can also say, you know what's really ironic is I did Joe Rogan's podcast and we joked around about this happening and then it did happen.

Speaker 4:          02:24:01       And it's so crazy. You just fucked this whole plan because it's all, it's all public. No, no, no, it's not because it's your, your belief in the Lord. So powerful that despite the fact that you talked about faking it, you're going to talk about it in the exact same way because it actually did happen. It's almost like God was like, Oh, you think you're so smart, Tj? Well, I'll show you. I'll show you and I'll have the exact same scenario, play itself out and I will show myself to you and I will touch your heart. Yeah, there you got. The Lord did. He touched my heart, tj. Just a few, a scant few years later. How much my heart, how much you think Joel Olsteen clears in one day. We can look, you can look and his net worth some probably scary. And what's that's gotta be here. Supposedly what it's worth.

Speaker 4:          02:24:41       56 million lives in a $10 million house. It's a good little good little scan he's got going. That's probably more ag balling Hashtag ball and for Jesus. That's incredible. Now, how does one justify that? We had this guy on will mccaskill who, uh, runs this organization called effective altruism. He donates all of his income above $35,000 so he gets to $35,000. He keeps that everything else he donates. Yeah. That's like a real holy man. And a lot of ways. I mean, he's just living laughable. Olsteen $56 million net worth $10 million just comes home and his gold underwear. Well, look, he's kind of smart. He's, he's built prosperity into the his doctrine. Cause what he pedals is like, if you, if you're good and God loves you, God wants you to be successful and prosperous. Right now there's nothing in Christian doctrine actually back that up. Like Christians are persecuted and God does not give them an easy life.

Speaker 4:          02:25:40       They get crucified upside down and they get persecuted by authorities and all sorts of stuff. But he's figured out some way to spin it. Like if you love God and God loves you, that God wants you to be successful. So basically his, all his money in his houses and his prosperity, that's all that's, God gave that to me and that's part of my faith. Yeah, but you asked for it, bitch, you asked for money. The people paid, they paid to hear the word of God and hearing it through you. God didn't get involved at any point. What happens if somebody really charismatic who's really smart, decides to play that as a scam? I mean, it's happened a bunch of time start history, but like someone is like a really good actor. Like Denzel Washington, Denzel Washington becomes a religious icon too. Could you imagine if Denzel Washington at a nowhere had some religious epiphany or faked it and then decided to go on television and and, and had like a very powerful message for people and then started making youtube videos and then started preaching and arenas.

Speaker 4:          02:26:40       People would, oh my God, you would leave there. Your life would be changed. Denzel Washington, Denzel Washington from like training day, like the kind of fucking power that guy can deliver. If he could deliver a sermon like that, Joel Olsteen would just jump off a building. He would watch that and go with the FEC business and Joel Olsteen would be like his opening act. If an email is, it would be like the shitty opening band that no one cares about. Yeah. If you got like a real actor, like a real powerful actor to go up there and do it in a real, I mean there's like, like a guy like Leonardo Dicaprio, like Leonardo Dicaprio. It's a problem with Leo is he's too handsome and he gets too much posey. You're not going to take them seriously. You just not, he's just got too much money. He's always bawling on all over the world is on yachts with models.

Speaker 4:          02:27:28       Too much money. I'm sorry. But if we could get past that, if somehow or another we could get past that, like if that guy has settled down, he had a wife and he had a kid and then he had some religious epiphany and then he really got close to the Lord and he was really like gathering up the scripture and then he started fucking preaching. You really want this happen to you want, I can sense it in you like, oh yeah, yeah. Well I soon politics is for people that suck at Showbiz. Yeah. It's for ugly people. The Suck Showbiz and that's essentially what religion is. I mean it's like a four. It's another form of show business. Does it mean what you're doing is by doing it that way. The only way you do it that way is you have to put on a performance. If you've got to stand in front of all those people and talk about what the Lord does to me, like whatever. What do you have passion for it or not. That is an orchestrated performance. It's an art form. Your design, your riling sensibilities

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       up and stimulating their minds. Fucking weird. It's a fucking weird way to worship. You know, it's very weird. You pay a bunch of money to get no arena and some con man screams and yells about the lord and pretends that he could read people's minds and heal the sick. Those motherfuckers that touch people wiggle there. There. Oh, your death. I'll wiggle my finger in your ear and now you can hear it's a miracle. And then they're rushed off real quick. You know, like by deaf person or formerly deaf person. What's really creepy when the, I forget which one, which guy got busted with the earpiece or the preacher. They exposed to my James Randy. That fucking set up that, that the operation where you could hear his wife talking to him and tell him, no doubt people yell is healer guys as Benny Hinn type dudes. And I didn't destroy his career either.

Speaker 2:          02:29:16       He kept going, why don't people aren't reading? Just keep going. Peter popoff was Peter popoff. Peter popoff. I didn't know who that guy was to so many of them know. It's just, it's, I guess that's the way they make a living. Yeah. It's a nice little racket. They got going. We were talking about doing it for you. I think you could do it though. You can fucking nail. You could do it. Any of us could do it. You could really do it. I could really do it. Yeah. Cause I got the whole atheist angle. I can play like I used to be this way, but now I've seen the light, the former amazing atheist. Now the amazing Christian.

Speaker 2:          02:29:51       I can see the title now. Yeah. I have to get some, uh, like teeth. Whitener and dude, you get it. Cut My hair a little bit. Your hair short. It'd be fine. Cut the hair a little shorter. Yeah. Find yourself a nice Christian Gal. Dress up in a nice, that's, it would be hot Christian Pussy. That's what took you over to the top. Oh yeah. I can even tell. Tell him that. Like, look, I just noticed that the Christian Pussy is just way higher caliber, so it's way better. They're freaks, they're all suppressed and when you finally get him alone, they think Jesus isn't looking. Yeah, thank you. And that's why I decided to convert. Imagine if like it took a few years and then you had made it, look, I'm just going to be real with y'all. I converted because Christian Pussy is the best pussy. It's like it's not even close.

Speaker 2:          02:30:35       You know it. Come on. Why do we mind? You got to believe in Jesus when you just know. I mean you know you fucking atheist pussy or a pagan pussy or whatever and you're like, all right, I guess this is okay, but you hit that Christian pussy and you just feel that the might of God touching your cock is almost like Jesus himself is giving you a hand job. Can you imagine if there was a belief system that changed the way your pussy felt? Like if, if, if you knew that the girl didn't believe in Jesus when you had sex, like oh it was all wishy washy down there. No structure. Like, like we were talking about this the other day about wild pigs that when wild pigs get loose, like you take a domestic pig, when they get loose, their body morphs, their snout grows, the hair gets thicker, their tusks role grow longer. Imagine if like when a

Speaker 4:          02:31:19       woman really believes in Jesus, if she really believed in God, her pussy would just tighten down like a fist and you would realize it when you, when you were fucking, they're like, wow, the Lord is inside of her. This is a garage should come inside of that cause I should make babies with her because the Lord is inherent. She really, when the Lord Lord resides within this con man, we could maybe you could tell by having sex with them. Imagine that and the guys would cry.

Speaker 7:          02:31:44       Bill grew, believed in the Lord, whoever, girl bereaved or girl I believe, believed in the Lord. I was out outsource where I was like, just take him out dick and a bucket of Jello. There was enough and there's nothing. There's no, hey, there's no hope. There's no future.

Speaker 4:          02:31:59       And there's this guy holding his wife's hand, like a death grip. She's got this Christian smile and her eyes and you know, our pussies, a vice grip, just up ball Milkin, vice grip, industrial suction power, clamp down. Imagine

Speaker 4:          02:32:21       there's already a lot more Christians. Yes. You know, that would be something that would be something that would uh, would definitely get people on the side of Christianity. That's one of the weird things about Islam. This is only the more radical sex of it. And the more, the deeper that people get into it when they want to cover up the entire woman, like cover everything came and see her, can't even see her when she goes out, cover it up. And the, the idea is like if you don't cover up, then you know, men are just going to be like totally rape crazy. Like, oh my God, they must, they must really like the fuck. Yeah. I mean it was, they, they, you know, like the, the, I don't know how, how, how true statistically it is. But you know, they say that like they're, the rape is a big problem when they go to these western countries, these refugees and shit.

Speaker 4:          02:33:05       Oh they're probably not used to seeing all these little short, short like God, it's like a fucking buffet, a pussy around here. Don't you think that any country that has been around for as long, like any part of the world really we're civilization has existed in [inaudible] for a long, long, long time. It's very difficult to get those people off their old ways. You know, and when you're dealing with a place like the Middle East, Iraq is the oldest with, they think that like sue mayor, which is where our rack is as far as we know, that's the oldest civilization we're currently totally aware of. Right? 6,000 years ago there was people living in there and they had mathematics. They had, agriculture has really advanced civilization for the time and the, the people that are there today in a lot of ways. I mean there's people who have come in and people have left. But a lot of the fucking energy and the ideas that culture are still in some way connected to this 6,000 year old culture. We're still kinda fucked in this country cause we're connected to, the puritans were connected to the pilgrims that landed. I mean all these people that came over here seeking religious freedom and they were super religious and super puritanical and their beliefs, remember it wasn't just the puritans were saying it was, it's, it was kinda like the puritans were sent. Well

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       the puritans came here to escape religious persecution and then a lot of the dregs of their society were sent here. Like, get the fuck Outta here. Go over there. Yep, go colonize the new world forum, a new life for yourself there. That's my family. Well, you know, that's what I'm saying like, but if you really look at it, that's like the flip side. I mean, you can kind of even look at America today and still see like, oh, here's the pure, here's where the puritan element comes in and here's where the degenerate scum fuck element comes in, and then you got America,

Speaker 4:          02:34:41       right, right. Yeah. It's a look. Anytime you start a fresh country, it's a God damn gamble and a bunch of people are going to come over here and you're not going to get the best stuff. But look at Australia. Australia was started as a prison colony. It's one of my favorite places to visit. The people were fantastic. Never been there. Oh Man, you'd love it. Fucking Melbourne is amazing. It's amazing. One of the best cities I've ever been to. The people are so cool. They're like, it's like a cool San Francisco type vibe with a weird accent. Not Weird to them. Fucking nicest people in the world. There's so few of them. They have it so much better over there because there's as many as there is in the La area and their entire fucking country. Now what? What I do? That's a lot of fucking people, man. Oh you just like, we're like, I just, cause I'm thinking about that,

Speaker 1:          02:35:32       like how ridiculously overpopulated we are. Oh yeah, the second I land in La like you go watch, there's like a weird vibe instantly. Like I just feel like way more guarded here and stuff cause I, there's like a sense of like, like a faint whiff of like violence that's always in the air here. You can just feel like the tensions that exist. And I noticed people are like, a lot of people aren't here a super apologetic all the time for like the slightest thing. And I think it's just cause they all feel it. Like there's like kind of a powder keg here that could just explode at anytime. Or maybe they're just polite. They're not like, what are people that are super apologetic about what look like I was when I went, first thing happened to me when I walked out of the airport was this guy, he's, he's doing a suitcase and he hits my foot with it and he says he's sorry.

Speaker 1:          02:36:20       He's like, oh I'm so sorry. But he keeps pulling it like, you know, so he's not really changing what he's doing. He's just given me an apology for it so I won't get mad about it basically. Oh, I see. So he didn't stop what he's doing and readjust and try to not hit your foot? Yeah, I mean I just got out of the way at that point, but, but you know, it's, it's, it's like people around here, they almost, they tried to like, uh, diffused a sorry over things to diffuse any possible like, well if I say sorry, then people won't be as pissed and everyone's kind of stepping on each other's toes here because it's so crowded. There's so many fucking people, there's so many different cultures trying to coexist, you know, in one place, like even, you know, from Seattle and shit, like the area I live in has got like a lot of Asians there and stuff, but like you don't really feel that sense of like the clash going on or like there's tensions between these different groups of people because the attitude that they have like in the northwest, uh, at least the parts of it I live in and just kind of like,

Speaker 4:          02:37:16       people just can't really, don't give a shit about each other. And there's sort of like an air of like detached, like, yeah, you know, I'll be somewhat friendly and shit, but we're not all going to fucking, we're not going to exchange all these niceties and shit in his very brusque attitude and people are to speak the entire area. Yes. You view this spokesperson. I am their spokesperson in Seattle to be very friendly. Well, I don't live exactly in Seattle. So maybe you're in the area where people go to escape the friendliness of Seattle, maybe. So. Maybe I am. Well, I mean, I, there's a lot, like I said, there's a lot of Asians there. They tend to be brusque. I feel like racism here comes, Oh yeah. Especially against Eskimos. I don't fucking put up with that in you. Which shit? Yeah, I'd like Pacific northwest.

Speaker 4:          02:37:56       I think it's a, you're, there's a neat, unique connection with nature when you get rained on all the time and everything's green is fuck. Oh yeah. I think you guys have a better connection with nature. Like A, I have some friends that live in Ballard and we went to, um, there's a park over there, you know, and they have kids that are my kids' age. We all went to the park and we were hanging out there and we're like, God damn, everything is so green. It was like, you guys are not just used to this. Like this is like normal for you. Right? Yeah. And we will. And, and, and it was a rare day where it was like super sunny and warm and it was like, okay, if this was like this all the time, do you know this place would be so fucking crowded?

Speaker 4:          02:38:31       Like your, your relationship that you have with nature is what keeps people away. But it also enhances, in my opinion, the way the people that live there look at things. I think they're more grounded. Yeah. Like I, I'm not really one who like, uh, focuses a lot on like the physical beauty of an area. But like I love just driving through like over a bridge or something in, uh, in, in the Seattle area and just seeing all the fucking hills and all the entries and all the water and everything just looks really like serene and picturesque and beautiful even though you know, there's a shit ton of people there. Yeah, there's a giant potluck, but like in la it's like there's the, the sun and everything, but you just, it just looks like a fucking, when you fly in la, that's just like a big grid of fucking lights and shit.

Speaker 4:          02:39:17       There's not much of a of nature left for you to be like, ah, well this is a flat patch of desert. They slapped all these stupid buildings up on. If it wasn't for this, it'd be like chaparral and fucking tumbleweeds and dirt. But what Seattle also has is you guys have the ocean and the mountains all just jammed up on top of you too. Like you can get to mount rainier from Seattle and what is it like 70 minutes, something like that. I think it might be a little longer, but maybe an hour and a half, two hours at the most because we were, we were up there, big foot squash and we were squashing me and Duncan trussell and we drove down from there, from Mount Rainier to a hotel in, you know, in the mainland and the regular area. So it was close enough that like within two hours or whatever it was, we could be in the middle of this incredible rain forest and then go right back down then. And you're looking at the ocean right there too. It's just so fucking vibrant. I look at it, it's like where I live, I'm like, I feel like I'm in the middle of

Speaker 2:          02:40:13       the fucking woods are, but I can drive five minutes and be in, in the downtown area. Right. It's just crazy. Yeah, it is crazy. You can't really get that. Uh, in, in La. No. And you have a good amount of people up there too. Like what is Seattle's population, like 5 million or something of the entire metropolitan area. Something like that. I know off hand, but find out what it is. Young Jamie, I'm going to guess it's like 5 million, which I think you should put a cap on. Don't let anybody move to me will die dude. Like even when I moved there, less than 5 million. How many city says it's only 650,000 you got to look at the Seattle metropolitan area though. That's a good number though. 650,000 that's beautiful. But even when I moved there, like when I told people just went 7 million, 703.7 so that ain't shit.

Speaker 2:          02:40:58       That's beautiful. Yeah. You know, but like even when I moved there, like people are already kind of like, I could sense like people being like, Eh, more people and people always do that though, man. Yeah. They're like, no, we're good. It's just like you said, you know, like, let's try to try to stop anyone new from coming. Greedy fucks. It's like, fuck you. You've got a great spot. If you wanted to go more hippy though, would you go portland? Uh, no. No. I don't know. I've never really been to portland sweet spot. I'm actually planning on going to Portland to see, you're a concert you're doing there. Yeah. 20th of February. Don't. By 20th of April. You didn't buy tickets, did you? I don't know. I'll hook it up. Yeah, I got a lot of people coming. Okay. How many people? Uh, six or seven. I can make that happen.

Speaker 2:          02:41:45       All right, cool. But um, that's bought is a, portland to me is like, um, there's a few, there's like a handful of places that I would live outside of La, Seattle, Seattle for sure. Portland for sure. Denver, Austin, Texas. And then it would get weird. I get weird after that. Everything else would get like, man, maybe I could do it, but outside of Denver or boulder, when I say Denver, I'm really mean. Colorado. Like I could live in aspen too. I love it. I love when I was trying to escape Ohio, like we all sat down and we were trying to all come to a consensus about where to move to and like a lot of those places were considered like we, we were tossing around Austin, we were tossing around La, we were tossing around Portland and we're tossing around Seattle. So it's kind of pretty similar places where we would live.

Speaker 2:          02:42:28       Those are the only places cause I was not happy living in Columbus, Ohio. Yeah. Well there's a lot of great people in Columbus. Sure. But that winter can suck my dick. Yeah, that's, we were done with it. Fuck you. Giant mountains of fucking snow just piling on us. I mean, I mean Duncan trussell I'm texting him every day. Fuck New York City cause another blizzard just hit, you know, and I'm like fuck you and fuck New York because Duncan just moved there. I'm like, why'd you leave me bitch, you leave. You left me and went to a stupid spot that's nose in the middle of Goddamn March. It's deep. We're deep into March. Right. What is it like the 16th or something 15th Fuck Outta here. Can't be snowing. That's, that's too late. It's no more snow. No, no, stop it. It's not allowed to snow anymore. Fuck this. You get jammed in there for a couple of days.

Speaker 2:          02:43:13       But even that, like I think New York is a weird combination of weather and extreme population. I think when you get that, whether there could be, there's good things like what Seattle has is like a good amount of whether like it gets rain but it only snow. It was like a couple of days a year if that, like it only gets below actually a pretty weirdly heavy snow storm. Um, this year. Yeah, I saw that. But um, that was very unusual for the area. Yeah, like spring, the winter, it's more like just constant cold, dreary, rainy. But I'm okay with that. Like I walk out in the sun in la here and I'm like, fuck this shit. Like I'm, I'm look how white I am. Look at this. I mean, I don't, I don't want that. You love the overcast skies. I love the rain. Do you love reasons to be depressed?

Speaker 2:          02:43:59       I mean, I don't, I don't need a reason to be depressed. I'll be depressed no matter where the fuck I am. My surroundings might as well at least a reflected. Um, you get used to the weather out here, you get used to this son. But I'll tell you one time I lived, I used to live in Palmdale. Oh, did just so I Kinda, I kinda understand the climate a little bit that places a bit mathy. Yeah. Palm Dale gets a bit messy. It gets a bit messy. And in and Audi, there's a lot of in and outs out there. It seems like main food source be in and out and then quite methy. Yeah. Uh, I just remember, you know, I remember living out there and just seeing like the, you know, it was just like, we want to live near La, but yeah. You know, we don't really want to pay la prices so exact.

Speaker 2:          02:44:37       Homedale and they did just have to commute every day for an hour, which if you see it in the morning, I drove up there once real early in the morning. I was driving up towards Bakersfield and it was like, boy, I want to say like before dawn. So it was about five 30 in the morning and the amount of people coming towards la from way past bakersfield was fucking stunning. Like stunning. Like I really had no idea. And it's people that can't afford housing in La and so they commute and they commute and they have to get up really early in the morning to do it because at five 30 in the fucking morning, it's bumper to bumper traffic on the five. It's nuts, man. Like yeah, I ain't never seen anything like it when you, you, you, you just go, oh my God. Like this is something that I didn't even realize was an issue.

Speaker 2:          02:45:22       All those people that can't afford to live in La and they drive down and it's a lot of fucking people that live out there and drive down here for work a lot. They should just build it. They should put in some high speed rail and just fucking with it, talking about doing more affordable housing along the way for people to just establish these artificial communities. But there's a lot of resistance to that. People that live in that area don't want those areas developed. Who the fuck knows? Now we're developers. Now we're talking. When we're talking to Melvin, we talked about, and we talk about Jesus. We talked about bossy and we talked about waffles. Does anything we should talk about land development. Same thing. We should take back what we said today. I thought, I don't feel bad. I feel, I feel pretty good. I feel pretty good. I'm pretty good about it. I'm not, I don't feel like there's anything that was said that needs to be like, oh, we better revoke that. People take it

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       the wrong way or so. You definitely are going to fuck them. There's nothing you can do about that. Nope. But it is what it is. Uh, if people want to see your youtube videos, your channel is still the amazing atheist. That's right. Or they can check out my podcast, a drunken peasants, and that is the podcast. No matter what Bill Maher says, your podcasts is essentially the podcast. It's sunk. Milo. That is wasn't mine. I mean, well, Milo Sunk Milo more than anyone else did, but thanks dude. Let's do this more often. All right, cool. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Bye everybody. See you.

Speaker 3:          02:46:45       [inaudible].
