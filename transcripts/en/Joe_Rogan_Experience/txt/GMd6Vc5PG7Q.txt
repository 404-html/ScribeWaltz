Speaker 1:          00:00:04       We're here in the podcast on day one of the robots attacking the people. It started in Tempe, Arizona. Someone's killed by a self driving uber. I'm not buying those things. Put the self driving ubers. I'm not ready for this yet. No chance. It's not ready to die. I'm not ready for planes. They should have those things on a closed course over a long period of time, you know, and then let them drive around cities. Yeah, we got to build some trust. Yeah, I'm not, I'm not trusting. We got to have some obstacle courses. Self-Driving. Uber Kills Arizona pedestrian as all as cops. This is hilarious. Is that an uber car? A cop car? Uber's. They look like cop cars. What's the thing on the roof? Uh, the camera. It lets it drive fencers, dude. Fuck all that. Not to say that a guy couldn't have done that. And not to say that this person, whoever it was, who knows what the circumstances were. Sometimes accidents are unavoidable, right? I mean there are certain times where someone makes an error.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       We don't know, but I just feel better if it's a person making an error for some strange reason came here. I think uber and lyft would have like a gang war. They probably would. Yeah. If you let the algorithms take over, it's over. They probably fuck with each other. Don't they like the Uber Guys? Super aggressive as they get. Didn't get in trouble for doing the uh, like fake. Oh, that's causing problems. Finding a real. Is that real? Is that a real story? Networks. But it was like allegations I think because they were private getting sued, sued each other, whatever. So I don't know if it ever came out and [inaudible] yeah, no, there was allegations that they were like making fake calls. Right? Is that what it was? Fake requests just bailing last minute to do you got the right idea. Living up in the middle of the nowhere. You got the right idea with that.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       We uh, we just got to uber but it's only two dudes and I have both their numbers. Say just call me. I can just cry. Yeah, that's actually cool. People are in your town a little like 2,400 slugs, you know how to drink. That's a fucking good place to live. The currencies beer, but that's the thing that was. Everyone can do everything but no one wants to work. It's pretty hilarious. Look at this. Uber's dirty tricks. Quantified rival counts. Five thousand 560 canceled rides. That's in 2014. Is that real? And that's right when it started. Is that definitely. It's on CNN so it can't be fake news.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       I've never canceled an uber. I feel really bad about it. About never canceling. Well No. I mean if I canceled I'd be like, I'd want to like tell the guy. Yeah, I'd be like, hey man, just should be a way. If you have to cancel it to give the guy a tip, that's a good move. You know, like say I have like super last minute cancel. This guy's already wanted us way over here. Let me throw them 30 bucks. Or are we used to five star at least something. Something given some money. Give him five bucks, five bucks per canceled ride. That's not bad. Right? That's more than fair. You're setting them back a few minutes. You don't get anything back when they fuck with you though. So know you son of a bitch, but who are people that are fucking with

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       you? Is it the rare uber driver? Every Uber I've ever been to was a dream. I've never had a single problem. Have you had uber x ever though? That's the truck. Well, that's just like random people with cars. Oh, right, right, right. No, I always do the one with like. It's basically limo drivers that are like off duty. Yeah, those are awesome. If you ever uber acts, it can get a little dicey. Oh, you're just with a random chick that's having a meltdown. Oh yeah. Yeah. I can imagine. I mean, she's cool. It's not like it's a big thing, but it's just like, you know, I can't pay my dsl bill this month and you're like, lady, I'm right here. It's a very small car. This people that just. They're working their life out, but let's say if they're unlike a hundred level game, they're on level one and they're bouncing into the walls over and over again and they just don't seem like in order for you to give them real advice, you'd have to basically move into their house.

Speaker 2:          00:03:52       You'd have to like give a full revamp of the way they look at things. You'd have to go. Okay, stop. Okay. First of all, what are all these pills? Second of all, what are you eating third of all? Like why are you talking to people like that? Like if you talk to people like that, they're not gonna want to talk to you, like you're upset that they don't like you, but then you act in a way that's very unpleasant to be around. Right. And then you'd have to go through every mistake this person's been. Then you'd have to find out. It's almost all shitty parenting. It's like plumbing. Yeah. Back Down to the root system. The roots got into the pipes or you know, I'll look at crack because of the earth shifted and you're losing all this water down here. Yeah. You just start screaming when you feel threatened at all.

Speaker 2:          00:04:30       Like that may be a thing from your childhood. Yeah, there's a lot of that out there. There is. Um, I wanted to talk to you about social media. Okay. Because I, I love you too. I think you're very good guy. I really do. But you are the worst representative of yourself on social media. I'm a lawyer myself. It's a bad form of getting out tricky ideas. It's a bad form. It's just not good. I mean now it's, what is it to 80 now? Two hundred 80 characters is better than it was 1:40 was very rough, like 1:40. You'd have to, you know, you have to really think about what you're saying. So you're yelling like as you're falling into a well you have like one sentence but you, you are without a doubt addicted. And I know you bailed on your phone for awhile and you went to a flip flip on.

Speaker 2:          00:05:16       Yeah. But I see these manic tweets from you and I, I just want to go hang out with you and go, dude, what are you doing? Why are you constantly tweeting and attacking people and it's like sometimes the chaos helps me. I mean, you're right, right? I'm not challenging. That's David, but like I see it as almost like a idea sonar where you're just like, I, I get that. I get that, but I get that because I know you did a really good dude and real life. Thanks man. So when I see this online and I see these blurting out post just outbreak posts, they're just, they're just like, like you got diarrhea. I mean just let me see if I could throw the word nigger in here for a goof. Let me see if I can say something that's going to piss people off.

Speaker 2:          00:06:00       And it's just, there's this weird thing you're doing like this Jessalyn next thing. Like you just decided to attack Anthony. Jessalyn, I'll tell you. Did he attack? You know what happened was someone said that a data hurt I, he said I was outright, which is like the new people can believe that they could believe that you were outright, but if someone tells them it's appear outrageous tweets, there's one or two of them, they'd go, oh, this guy's an outright comedian, and then they see you with certain people that you've had podcast with and talk to. That might also be lumped in immune ridiculously. So like Jordan Peterson, they lump him into. No, I gotcha. It doesn't make any sense, but they do it like I'm in luck. I've had people on that people think are all right. I mean people. People are fucking crazy. I mean there's people out there think Ben Shapiro is antisemetic.

Speaker 2:          00:06:46       That's how. That's how I know there's no, there's no logic at all. Like right now, Martin Luther King Jr would be considered outright by certain crazy people. He would probably have adjusted his views. Don't you think? I mean his views, it probably changed knowing all that we know about people today and I mean he would be a different person. You've got to think that guy growing up in the 19 fifties and then beans into the sixties as a, the most important civil rights activist of all time. He was dealing with a completely different world. Man. There was no social media, there was, there was not much consolidated power is probably very difficult to get people to March once they start sicking dogs on people and blowing fire hoses on them. I mean, you had to be, you had less protection and he'd had to be more, more rigid and conservative than just because people would have to be just very careful if that's, you know, we, we talked about this recently, I guess it was, was it Danielle Lee Bailey we were talking about about how recently slavery was.

Speaker 2:          00:07:45       Was it him? Was it Danielle might. Might've been either way. Um, it's, that's a crazy small amount of time. Crazy 200 years ago and it's been existed for like tens of thousands of years and that there's more slavery in the world today because there's more people alive. It's kind of tricky. But this last percentage of people that are slaves, so it's kind of misleading when people say it's more sleek slavery, there's way more people. That's a good point. Yeah. There's more everything way, way, way, way, way more people and there's way more crazy people and now they all have Internet access. Yeah. Because I was looking at this thing where they were trying to trace. You've heard about that new species of human that they found, I think around somewhere in the range of a seven or eight years ago. Dyno scions, I think they call them.

Speaker 2:          00:08:29       They found them in Russia. And what they are is, um, you know, when there was neanderthal and Homo Sapiens, there was another one and then this other one bread. There's apparently they think there was many different kinds of humans. Oh yeah, for sure. But what the faith thing. That fucking freaked me out, they were talking about how long ago, this was like 70,000 plus years ago that they were, they were talking about one era and then they were talking about the amount of people that were alive then. And they said something around the area of 100,000 humans total amount that's on the four or five right now. Just fuck that on the four. Oh, five between here and West Hills. Probably more. And that's why we have such a vicious instinct because at that point it's just, I think it got down to like 10,000 people at one point.

Speaker 2:          00:09:16       Yeah, that's what I was reading the article about. It was also talking about um, in Sumatra. And we talked about this recently. There was a gigantic super volcano that blew up and it fucked the earth up for like a thousand years. And we had to survive that. Yeah. And now we're trying to survive twitter storms and, but we have those same instincts, the same instincts that are like, if you can't eat your dog right now, you're going to die with the Jesuit thing. So what? So I just went on his and he had already blocked me and I had never written anything to him. So I just. So I just posted that instead he got, he has a liposuction is asked because I thought that was funny because I didn't want to go too big. I was like, well why even do that? Like who gives a shit if he blocks you.

Speaker 2:          00:09:55       I just thought it was funny. Right? But you're attacking them publicly. This is the thing. It's like you have like how many thousands of twitter followers. Yeah, like 120,000. That's a lot of fucking people. So a lot. But he's a strong man that have messed with me way too long, man. Like that's got to sting. There's got to be like this disturbance of peace and tranquility for no reason. Just because he blocked. You give a shit if people. I hope you gentlemen, I like you. Go block me buddy. I love a good guy. He's a great joke, right? It's a funny guy, man. This is the problem is said like I'm a colleague of his, um, at the comedy store with him all the time. We go on back and forth next to each other all the time and you know, just like you should attack someone when they do something really bad, but you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          00:10:43       I do know what you're saying, like the sheets stored until you absolutely need it. Yeah. I'm all about that and I. I wasn't like full attack mode. I was being playful. The wars started. You're talking about him getting liposuction and talking about him being gay and you're talking about a. You said a bunch of different things, but that's after he said in response. He said that I'm an outright the third rate piano comic and I was like, dude, I just did a, a liposuction joke, but the thing is I'm not even mad at the guy at all like I want. Then again, do a terrible job of representing yourself. That's a good point because it seems to me even I had a text you. I'm like, what are you doing? I know. By the way, I just want to give you a compliment. I love it.

Speaker 2:          00:11:24       You're more critical offline. Like you're one of the few people right now in this world. It's like, oh, what the fuck are you doing? I love it, but online you're chill and so many people are the opposite. They attack on line and apologize in the DM and you're. I just want to say that that's good leadership qualities. Oh, well that's very nice for you, but I'm not trying to be a leader. I just try to be a good person. I think if you you have an issue with someone you should do. You should talk to them in person if you can, if not on the phone, but that one on one, like this idea that you should automatically blurt out what you think about someone's public mistakes to the rest of the world to state your position. Like there was a lot of the requests to state your position after Louis C K got in trouble.

Speaker 2:          00:12:06       I have no idea what actually happened. If, if the way that women are telling it is 100 percent true than I am, I think it's fucking gross and disgusting and I'm sad. I'm sad that he had that in his head that he wanted to do that. I'm sad that the girls had to experience it. It's an uncomfortable thing, but I don't know that and I've heard stories about people thinking it was funny too, you know, there's. There was like this weird thing going on, the tribal stuff where it's like, what side, what side are you on? But people were like this, the Louis C, k instance was the first instance so that I can recall where people were demanding a response, like a public response about something. Well, I noticed that in entertainment with trump, it's like the lack of talking about trump is now seen as endorsements.

Speaker 2:          00:12:47       Like when Taylor swift just didn't get involved in the chaos. People were calling her like, all right man, it's, it's, there's so many people just waiting, waiting to pull the trigger and they're doing so in such a fucking insane and ridiculously misrepresentative way. There was something about Jordan Peterson, Jordan Peterson, I'm going to speak somewhere, and there was these people sending emails that he was a Nazi and Oh yeah, schist and a racist and trans phobic and just. But they're just hurling. These nuclear bombs have words with literal. Literally. No. We're no thought whatsoever about the consequences of using these words to describe someone who's absolutely clearly not that of course it's when someone can't argue another side, they just. That's how they shut down the conversation, but here's my point, is that it elevates this manic misrepresentation of reality because they've agreed to not look at it realistically.

Speaker 2:          00:13:45       They've agreed. Who cares if he's not a Nazi, we're going to fucking calm Nazi, and in doing that you, you, you're, you're escalating. What's like, if there's a mob mentality, right? It's part of what's going on. One of the things didn't happen to mom mentality, so people start murdering. People jump in. If people killing people and you're trying to get away the guys running at you with a knife, you're going to fucking kill it. That's what people do. It's a normal thing. It happens with my mentality to, to happens this with this, these kinds of arguments, the same kind of thing. People could just decide they don't care if you're right, they're going to call you a fucking racist. They're going to call you a Nazi. They could just gonna keep saying it until you believe it. One hundred percent. Like this fucking Nazi Kurt Metzger. Ladies and gentlemen. Good to see you, pal. Thanks for coming, man. Pull up. Pull up. Get them in there. You got him on camera then. Good. Good to see you buddy somewhere. Oh, well this room is separately heated. This is its own little, uh, air conditioning and thermostat system. Like the sauna looking good. Yeah. This part was built. This was not a room. So this room was created like a radio studio. Like same deal with thick walls. All insulated and on a nice sense

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       of the world bunker. Yeah Buddy. It's all concrete. Cement Shit. And there's a fan that sucks pot smoke out. So if people are getting high, he just. Oh wait. Huh? What's the matter? What about it? Oh Shit. Scenic drive. Well today it is man. La, when it rains out, it's like nothing else. Beautiful. Gets so green and drive over by. Um, uh, when you're going over the four or five when you come in over the top of the hill. Holy Shit. It's stunning doing this area sick. Like I, I can't stand west Hollywood area now. There's too many people, too many people, too many people to it. I really would like to do what you're doing. What you're doing, I think is ideal. Where are you doing? Oh, and did you return to the land of giants? To. With my wild length where we just yell at each other and it's all good.

Speaker 1:          00:15:42       Did you return to lilliput? Put as the god of those little people. I brought home new information and gold and silk. Are you. Where are you living again? You told me in the adirondack mountains in northern New York. Oh, I get a. or just thinking about that. Wow. I love the idea of it sounds amazing except for where you are. It's got a lot of ticks that have a line when it gets too cold in the winter to really have that. But it just started coming a little bit because it's like negative 40 where I live in the winter, so he's Christ. So now my 44 real negative 40 for like a while. That's why I got the sauna because I just fire up and then go outside Newton and roll around and it's just crazy. Negative 40. Yeah. I don't think I've felt that before. It's so remarkable where it's just you go outside and you think, if I didn't have clothing, I have 10 minutes to live it. It's just this wild feeling. Well you know, I do that cryotherapy, which is a lot colder, but it seems fake. Like a million dollars was dancing a million. A guy on youtube, that Italian guy who that guy is, he puts you to videos of him dancing.

Speaker 1:          00:16:44       Fifty year old guy at dances on boats. John Luca vaccine. He's friends with Zac Efron. Oh, you signs with everybody? That guy's hilarious. He's a DJ. He does everything. He's an heir to have vitamin fortune or something. Is that what he is? Or his grandfather didn't. A company. Gary Centrum grandfather. That's so funny, dude. Lucas Centrum. Centrum fortune, that guy is living a fun life, you know, he's like an Italian version of Dan Bilzerian and a lot of ways. Yeah, right. That's like a thing like that old buff rich guy, but he's like in his thirties, like this. Yeah. This guy's only his thirties with a art attack and shit. He did, but it was from doing a lot of coke and doing. He did a lot of shit. He told the story. It was up for like two days, like dancing thousand dollars. Guy John Zika vaccine. Hilarious. This guy's awesome. Doing weird stuff with his pants that are very feminine.

Speaker 1:          00:17:40       Like you know, like Lou, those shorts when he's Italian, if a dude. Yeah. But be honest. If a dude that was wearing shorts like that came up to you start talking to in a men's room, you'd go, hey buddy, let me get past you and get through that door. Oh, we're going to have a problem now. Those shorts shorts are more obvious, like, I don't want to be too judgmental, but that's more than like an erection in Asana is the tattoos. I got tattoos everywhere, everywhere. It's his whole body and he just had another one. He had himself on his back. He's got a new one called the shut the fuck up tattoo. It's him going like shush on his back. I guess if I were to guess, if I wanted to decipher that people are talking shit behind his back this way. He's always facing them.

Speaker 1:          00:18:24       Go and Shush. It's pretty hilarious. I like when people get tattoos to, you know, like it's a power like eyes on the back of your head in prison. Look at this. All that writing. That's it. Look at all that writing. It looks like he's got a little tiny writing all over his body. He's a weird guy. It doesn't look like the stop talking behind my back show. She looks like I just fucked your mom. Don't tell anybody. It's also, it tells also kind of passive aggressive debt font that small because logo. Who's going to take the time to read his back? Yeah. You got to be real close that are fucking him.

Speaker 1:          00:18:56       Such a great body. Got To stop from coming. So I read. He does have his back. He does a lot of body weight. Exercise freezes himself. That's why I brought it up because I saw him on a video. Freezing himself was the time you want to do it after the show, what does it do? It jacks up your nor epinephrin Epinephrin norepinephrine levels. It produces something called cold shock proteins that are a radical inflammation fighters. It's fantastic for people that have like arthritis aches and pains. There's a lot of older folk that go to the place that I go to that go all the time and they said it's just changed their life. Like people with hip issues. Yeah, because your body goes into this thing and if you do doubles, I like to do a double means. I go in for three minutes, I warm up for about 10 minutes and I go in for another three minutes. How much is it to do it? A lot. It's a good question. Find out. I Dunno. It's not cheap. Yeah, because I only saw this fucking Julian. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:56       Whenever you can go to his place. It's going to my mountain, man. It's the whole thing all the time. What it is is your body has to feel like it's going to die and when your body feels like it's going to die, it freaks out and produces these anti inflammation properties. It's basically like twitter. The same thing with the sauna. You know Barry Criminal Law. He wanted me and him went on tour. Do that last year. Yeah. That guy saved my life man. I was like in a bad way when that guy called me. But uh, anyway, we got in a car, this guy driving on black ice and Pennsylvania where he tries to pass, say a tractor trailer, you know, some people don't want to be behind trailer so he goes to pass it and we're like 60, which is the, it's under the speed limit but it's black ice, you know, so we're going next. It felt like a jet engine sucking that. It was just wobbling. And so I'm in the passenger seat. Barry was behind the driver

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       and we just get sucked into under the trailer and the trailer. Yeah. So my head, I mean I already got my head cut off and I had time to say what the fuck three times I didn't know what the fuck, what the fuck, and then I was like, oh, I got some dead. I just remember thinking that swerved and then the back end, like my it started going away from the trailer and the back end got caught instead where no one was sitting that got pulled in, the windows blew in and then a drug us a little bit and spit us out. And we spun in Atlanta in the median. That's insane. It was. And uh, the driver was weeping. Oh my God, me and barry were like, I swear to God, like high, like I have never felt I could do that once a year, like a vacation to me, I swear to God, I like it, but I had to be.

Speaker 3:          00:21:33       I was like, sure. I guess my brain thing, I'm going to die, but I'm sure my body thought it was too. But it felt fucking amazing. Dude. I never felt anything like that. Like the be a trigger to die and they just don't know what happens to vet. Sometimes when they come back they don't want to admit it. But they got addicted to war. Yeah, right. Her locker, they can hurt law. Just thinking of that. Oh, that's 100 percent legit. They also. There's a good Sebastian younger book about that. I read that based on your pod tribe. Yeah, and these people, that's like the closest. They have a field in each others when they're in the middle of a war zone. It's like me on twitter. Man was weird talking about his twitter outbursts and poor representation of who he is as a person. Wait, so I don't understand.

Speaker 3:          00:22:12       What did you settle the matter at the guy. What do we say? Nothing. He just blocked him. He blocked him on twitter, so he decided to not sure he blocked. You definitely blocked him. So I just said something that he had wife on his ass. I didn't think that. That's a good question. I mean, I'm not. Whatever. I'm not worth it. He was never a fat guy. Now that's what it is. Crazy. If it was like, because he's really handsome man, so it's like that is so funny to me to light weight. So he did do that. No, no, no. We just made. Oh yeah. Because it seems like a very extreme. It's just a funny insult. How many comics, if you had a guest. I've had life on their ass over. I would. If I had like a friend that was like, hey dude, I.

Speaker 3:          00:22:55       I do like, like you would want to do some friend. You have to wear like this crazy compression close afterwards to really do it. It's not a joke. Then I probably want to do is fucking surgery. Yeah, right. They're, they're, they're good numbing your shit up and they're going in with a god damn pipe that's got a vacuum attached to it and they're roughing you up and sucking chunks. Violent. It looks fucking mad at how fat you are. Probably doesn't work because you don't change your habits. Either tape works, but listen, you're going to get fat again, like it'll make you look good for a little bit, but if you don't change how you eat your you, your, your static state right now where you're at, you're getting fatter. Most people, most people, if they're overweight, they're getting more overweight. They're not steady at at, you know, whatever the fuck it is, 50 pounds over. They keep keep going

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       because it's the same pattern of behavior, so if you get yourself sucked down there, I know people have done this, get yourself sucked down with the vacuum down to a good legitimate size. They just balloon back up and a lot of times there's a lot of unevenness why people get fat and weird places because they took out, get a little out right around the winter. I feel like I got a quarter inch in there that isn't being abused. Fat. It's also, I think they're saying based fat out your blood can get lumpy. Fucking wouldn't be smooth. Yeah, like at least if you've got a natural layer of fat, it's like a smooth. It feels right, but I suppose it doesn't work. I've seen people like, no, you understand I can't develop pectoral muscles. I had showed her nonsense. It's nonsense because like I can't do it. Well, no, that's not true.

Speaker 1:          00:24:32       There's all these talk shows. These guys are packing plants. Yeah, know dude, who have one of those I know do two implants and how did it end up for her? Not so good, man. Yeah. That's so good. That sounds real bad. And he wound up killing himself because of something else. I. Here it is life. Jesus Christ in the holy fuck. Yeah. I'd be scared. What's under the fat? My ass. I got. I don't know what's under there. This step limits cut. There might be a look at this, this weird shape. It's blood loss and maximizes post op comfort and what they're doing is going in on this person's stomach and just sucking tubes of it out. Here's the thing. This guy's not even that fast. No, that's a little bit all this guy or Gal, I don't know. We're only looking at a building site and Joseph was already hot.

Speaker 1:          00:25:19       He just was getting a little bit. She's like handsome guy. That's like so irreverent. I think that's really funny how it works. Look at the little fucking edges on the thing. Oh, that's. This is disgusting. This thing. Look how like you see, like when he was going back it up a little jamie. Those little things, those holes that like little knives, man, like a little bit. This is violent. There's a good few little knives in the end. It's took a cat's Dick, so he's just scooping it out of there. Is this a woman or a man? I don't know if someone is not that fat. If whoever the fuck this is, if they just got on the carb free diet for like a couple of weeks, it's not even like a thought. That long of weight to lose. I know a lady who didn't need it and got it done.

Speaker 1:          00:26:03       She literally didn't need it. I don't know. I don't know her that well, but I remember her friends saying how much extreme discomfort she was in because she had to wear essentially elect this, these tights. Super tight compression pants everywhere to keep all your ass fat together is an amazing deal. So debt. What I was having my ass fat loosened a little. I had a hair transplant. That was the dumbest thing I've ever done. One of the Feldman, that's what he did. I was giant scar in the back of my head. It looks like a smile. I wonder if that's a piece of meat. My job. You get like a scar from it. Yeah. My joke was that it's like taking people from a town where everybody is healthy and moving them into a town where everybody's dying. Feeling ones that were left elected, new recruits the hair that was supposed to be up there.

Speaker 1:          00:26:50       So where do you get it from? Like other parts of it from the back of your head. They take a strip off of that now the way they do it and a lot of places they do it differently. Do one individual follicle at a time. I just was scared that it was going bald. I was like, what can you do? And they tell you they could fix it. They're like, oh great. I'll just get it fixed. But it doesn't really fix it now. Well how come? Because Joel Mchale from suit, because I remember him from those Burger King commercials where you had less hair than I do and it all. Now he's got Dragon Ball Z. Wow. It's real thick. It's almost like more thick. Then they start with some killer transplant or is that just a great head of hair man? You remember the Burger King Commercial, right? I do.

Speaker 1:          00:27:28       I do. Not. Nobody does. It was when the office was getting popular, not to put the American one and Burger King at these commercials that were Kinda like the office and he was like the wider picture. One Burger have thicker hair, works better. Every bald guys. Fucking hair. More hair. I remember people with a thick hair follicles can get away with it. Like my hair would have looked way better, but I have thin hair. The hair's themselves are thin. So if someone has thick hair, they could prove they could have some pretty dramatic result of it's the right kind of thinning. Dirty? No, not even 30. Yeah, but what did you tell him to 31? Yeah, I think I was 28. I just started acting on TV and I was panicking because my hair was like, seriously fallen out and I was like, this shit, it's going quick, and I was like, well where's it going to go and get thicker pubes?

Speaker 1:          00:28:18       I knew that part of the reason why I was making money was the way I looked. I mean I, I was doing stand up and I was acting in these shows, but I wasn't an ugly dude and it helped, you know, like it was getting certain kinds of roles like boyfriend roles. That's chicken has to go through it. Yeah, you can be panic because you're like, well this is how I'm making money and I never made any money before. So all of a sudden I went from being completely broke and being a super struggling comic. Like if I got lucky, I was making 300 a week. Three 50 a week was a big. Was that bad? That bad for a week. Perfect. If you're a 25 year old guy, which is what I was trying to make it as a comic, then it went from that to making fucking shit piles of money and you're like, how do I not move back?

Speaker 1:          00:29:01       I'm not getting rid of this. Figuring out a way to keep this rolling, but if I should've just shaved my head. I just didn't know. Freedom. Freedom. Now even if I grew like a thick head of hair, I guarantee you it's still shaved my head. I don't want to go to a barber. I had a really nice lady used to cut my hair too. I loved her. She's fun, fun conversations, but I'd have to go to we're fucking place and she'd have to come and wake up every four day like a wine. Where's your mommy? Could you talk about that? That chilling pursuit, but I was on Samba Gb smoothies at this dinner show where it'd be like a couple of athletes and like a couple of comics. Oh yeah, and I don't because I don't really follow sports, but these guys were originally as a hockey player

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       in some football players in which minority and they're talking about all these treatments they would get, you know, and most of them started out as beauty treatments for, for rich fuck in Hollywood women real. And then they trickle down to athletes. That's, I swear to God they were talking about Cryo that way, like it was for fucking hot checks because they are kind of like a hot checks and kind of athlete. You go like, Oh yeah, when Kathleen Turner, like Blue Bluer face out from that shit on steroids for arthritis. No Way. She didn't want to be. You want people to know about some illness which start to get less work. So she just took all the jokes about how she looked like a man. She just took all the jokes to work and then find the chemo. We took kind like, hey, good for you man.

Speaker 4:          00:30:27       If he got work at it because you're not. People are terrified a for sick. Yeah. I mean being going from being an insanely hot woman. I know rose, that is a change of everything. That's a change of character. It's a character building, sky, losing all his money. You find out who really liked you the whole time, you know? Yeah. Just how you interface with the world. Like a beautiful woman. Interfaces with the world. Like the most popular celebrity possible. Beautiful woman is like Tom Cruise everywhere she goes. It's like Michael Cost as a bit about the same amount of data. It's almost the same amount of danger too. Have you got to watch who's coming up on you? Like how famous person with worse though for girls. Listen, men are dangerous and that's why we have a system called the patriarchy took women cost been a great system to protect women from the ages of men called Patriarchy and we threw it.

Speaker 4:          00:31:21       We throw it away because the colleges. I think it's important to talk about Patriarchy because I feel that young 20 year old women need their own Illuminati to talk about, you know, their failures on it's. Yeah. It's like it's Illuminati for girls conspiracy, patriarchy to ask for the set definition. There isn't one is that suspicious? Same with racist. There is one in the dictionary, but that's not the accepted one. Ask just any online feminist. What does it mean? There's no. Well you can be whatever you want to be like. It's, it's, it means you're my ex boyfriend named Gary Click of mean girls is that patriarchy are in a position of power. That's the patriarchy. But men have been in the workplace for hundreds of years more than women is that there's a real problem. Well, it should be caught up. But what about when you hear this shit where somebody goes and people wonder where all the female comedians like?

Speaker 4:          00:32:10       No. Uh, two people talking about it. When Louie got shellacked by that fucked up article, people were saying that shit about you. How come there's not an equal number of female comedians to males? Well, because women are treated better in our society. Yeah. If there's damage amount of female Comedians, you know, women are being abused way more than ever because you don't get in this job from a happy. This job isn't about support. It's you get last because you fucked up. So I hope there's not a lot of women in it that would mean they're being raped more does that, but it is

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       also, it's just from a female perspective of a chick's funny. It's harder because something happened to her. They can't, but they can't talk about certain things like, no, no man wants to see a woman on stage telling politic stories or politic jokes. It's funny you say that, but it did create a daily show. Maybe you, maybe you, but most people in the audience for the woman started out. I won't rule out anything if I'll take. I won't say any premise has hacky, just punch line. So if your premise is airline fucking peanuts, that's fine. Tell me what your punchline is. Maybe a punchline justifies it. I don't, I don't, I won't rule out any premise on the premises or hacky, but people probably don't want to hear it. But who, you know, it's like, look, if you can get people to listen to some shit that they basically don't want to hear.

Speaker 1:          00:33:27       Like, oh great, this is where I used to do the black rooms I started. So I totally agree with you. I'm totally in agreement with you. We're not talking about drinking caveman coffee. We're not talking. I feel wired is wicked from 270 milligrams. How many did you have? Like. Well, I just started skipping one, but I'm like, I'm the one that's empty. Did you black out and suck though? Ingestion? I just drank one. What the fuck is this dude talking about me? I'm talking about most people. When a woman goes on stage and does stand up, most people that are going to be in the audience, there's men that are just not going to want to hear you talk about politics. There's men that are not going to want to talk about sex. It's harder for a woman. I think it's a hard. It's a harder position.

Speaker 1:          00:34:07       Being a standup comic for a woman is just harder. So I think if it's harder, you're naturally going to see less people doing it and then there's naturally less people inclined to do it, but it's just like female mma, like most women are not going to do it. But guess what? A lot of women do it. If you're the type that does it, you fucking do it, but there's no fucking weird. What about the Patriarchy in an mma? Why Arthur equal number of women than men? You don't say that, right? They're not really fans of. I noticed that. Remember who the think? That's it. I think it's because it's an untenable argument. What you can't say. This should be an equal amount of women fighting as men because it's not getting punched in the face area. That's one area where we agree. It's one area we get to a goal.

Speaker 1:          00:34:47       Yeah, well men are. They do this better. This is. They do it more. They're doing it constantly and there's some elite female athletes in mma. Don't get me wrong, of course rivaled the elite athletes of men, but they used to summit and they had the operation when more men fucking way more. I mean it's not even seen with basketball. I was watching sport, I hope. Right, but my point is the same as standup stand is another getting punched in the face sport. To me that's super fucking difficult. You take an emotional beat. Some people don't want to do it. It's not a judgment call. It's not like you're better or you're worse picks you because the people that left that I started, I don't know if you think of when you started, people thought that were funny, that left and people that stage, I can't believe you're still here. It's clearly a calling at Nada. Yeah, you got to take a beat it. Some people just decide to. They've had enough. They like, they don't want to get off this fucking ride. You know? There's a lot of guys that were like big time touring headliners and they get to

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       a point though the fuck this. We usually go to vegas or something, right? Yeah. They do that. Or they just fucking get some sort of a writing job sometimes get writing jobs, you know, they started doing tree work like me, middle of nowhere. Just start cutting down trees. You know, I was, I liked the writer's guild, but listen, man, anybody who thinks that should be an equal number of men or women in any job and that if there's no clear evidence that this is a neutral occupation, that this is an occupation that doesn't favor any gender, like there's got to be jobs where it's equally represented, men and women. Outside of that, your job is what you choose to do with your life. When boys grow up playing with fucking trucks and superheros and girls grow up playing with dolls and they obviously are more inclined in this direction and men are more inclined in that direction that we expect them to meet at any interest and then we would that we would force it and force it, ruins it for women.

Speaker 3:          00:36:33       It makes them think that they should do jobs that they might not enjoy and then they get really depressed. Right? Yeah. Or they think that they need to prove themselves by doing a man's job. Exactly. Instead of just doing what they actually enjoyed doing. Well, I mean, you know, it's funny. As long as I can remember, my mom wanted to work and she got a job and then she was mad because she wanted to stop working because it's um, but uh, I mean it just depends on the level of need, right? Like what if there's like a war or a bad economy? So I'm guessing, what are you going to go get people? That's a different thing, right? It's different during the war, like everybody was sort of bonded together because they make shit constantly. Well, there seems to be a much more of a uh, you know, sometimes my girlfriend, my girlfriend's at college, I was like, I realize isn't even ties in with this jazz night thing because I realized or she realized that like half the bad things that happened to her in the last four years were social media related.

Speaker 3:          00:37:22       All this lyric or maybe all of them. I'm thinking about it like if I think all the bullshit like stress on my life that I had in his fucking need. It is real though. Like I've had a couple of theaters can say like ruined my life. Strangers like set out. I'm going to ruin your life. Like where I was like, wow, you got a lot of dude it. It costs money now. It's crazy. That's when you get theaters canceled for. Well, I booked a two art schools. I just paid them to run it like the area and I sold it out myself and then they would just cancel saying that I do hate speech or something saying, Oh, there's one merit in Chicago and then Brooklyn School of music just can't sign me. And I had to switch it that day. Chicago and Brooklyn though are hotbeds lubrizol Chicago was filled with and that's like, I'm a, I'm a piano player.

Speaker 3:          00:38:09       Has Two social jihadists. No Dude. And I thought that was like my, my, my safe spot. I'm like, dude, I'm a piano player. Algo is so full of like, dude, everywhere is the nothing from the neverending story. It's just like everywhere now. Well, you know, dude, if you go to these underserved markets, like Detroit's right there, there's people that want to see in Detroit. You Go, I'll go to Detroit. Be fucking amazing and track. Is that the [inaudible] areas? And I did this place. Oh, small some rock, dude. It was tremendous. I had a great time in Detroit. I did that. Fillmore did two shows there. It was fucking amazing resource in there. Like seven years ago. I was sick. Fucking fun, man. They appreciate you. Well, it's easy to forget or happy to be there. You know this horse shit because this cult that these people are in that's in Hollywood and New York and Chicago, religious there.

Speaker 3:          00:38:54       It's not the rest of the country. People aren't, you know, this is the thing that you get fooled with social media as you think this is reality, but it is everywhere, but they don't like it. That's the difference. I like how it would connect people being like, oh no, this is great. But it is in other colleges and college kids write me that they have to sign a white privileged contract like the college I've seen them, but at least they know it means they acknowledged their white privilege, which is basically. I don't know. It's something that happens usually for genocide or whatnot, but we put you acknowledge your privilege. You have it easier. That's amazing. I've never heard of grow. It's unreal. Well, they're giving kids in certain schools are given kids lectures on gender and then how some people are gender fluid, meaning that they can switch back and forth from male to female at anytime.

Speaker 3:          00:39:36       Like at what point in time do we go, okay, maybe that's true, but what's the odds that that's nonsense. The 100 percent overwhelming. I mean Kim, you might be someone with some sort of a psychological disorder where they do bounce back and forth between being a man, a woman, but at what point in time could we recognize this as a psychological disorder and this is just not a natural state of being like having red hair by the way. Also I don't give a shit like I know that involved me, but why do you have to teach kids that are fighting to be, you know, they go like, well, white is considered a default. I'm like, well that's because it's a majority white population like default doesn't mean because I don't understand what people are finding is by default. What do you mean? It doesn't make any sense.

Speaker 3:          00:40:17       Like when people go flesh colored bandaids or white, which I don't even know if that's still true, crown bending do, but it's literally a matter a matter of like populate, like why are you fighting to be default or like the boring. Like I became a comedian to be marginal. Like on the margins. I didn't want to be in the main dude. My gone. If I can't go on a fucking rollercoaster. Well the answer the bandaid thing, it's very easy. The time that bandaids were invented, it was a far greater population of white people. Yeah, no shit. There's more now. It's like they say within 30 years why people are going to be the minority. I think looking forward to it. Why is my kid white? I don't even know. Your kid is definitely not white. And your kids half Mexican. Yes. I spoke this in here by the way.

Speaker 3:          00:41:00       Yeah, sure. I'd rather use marijuana. What do you got going on? There are some little glass pipe. It's a chillum chill them. That's what these fish concert. But chill them. Was that thing they do with Hash a movie? Sure. But that's what I mean. So just a a one hitter. We got joints here. If you want to spark a joint. I do want to smoke a joint or joint. I think it's because it's student debt that all this shit's happening because of what? Student debt? No, a lot of fucking. No one's going to get a job from underwater vagina ballet. The economy tanked. All of a sudden there's money to be made and they're 60

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       grand in debt for underwater Vagina Ballet. And then they have to like justify it somehow. It's crazy. First of all, if you are an expert under water, Vagina Ballet, that's a marketable skill to. But you should not be broken all under one vagina. Ballet. The, the social media. If you noticed the news media started taking cues from like gossip shit. Okay. So like tmz is almost a quaint old respectable thing. Now to the onion is the most value. The Werewolf, right? Is that I'm going to smoke out this waiting for you to go to. It's okay, but you keep drinking craft golf whenever Gawker and fucking buzzfeed. Basically the print media is going out of business all of a sudden, gossipy bullshit and all the social jihadis. It makes a lot of money. Everything has got to be outraged or uplifting click. I said, yeah, and my friend who works in a no more, but my friend Aaron knew her from a rate when you came on race wars, it's serious.

Speaker 4:          00:42:28       She was like, yeah, I remember. That's. Yeah, may be managing. Get her Isabelle. Okay. She would get sick of these fucking generation. She spawned with her fucking just to sell shit too. That's the thing. It isn't like a big plan. It's just like to sell. It's the, there's now these people, whatever these problems are, they're claiming they don't want them solved. They clearly want to have the conflict going on forever because they make a living on it. There's people that just made, they're all in patriot. They're basically clergy, the clergy, this jihadi shit. Uh, uh, and you're always on Patrion with the handout who helped me go to schools and tell kids about fucking, you know, hit the Werewolf General queefs or whatever. I know they got to like make like make problems where there aren't any problems, but I think it's because of our instinct to run away from a lion as stronger than towards a banana.

Speaker 2:          00:43:14       I got offered an alternative point of view. Think about how often you get into bullshit arguments online and you're a successful comedian who's married with children. Now, think of yourself as being 20 years old at college, talk and Shit, writing a blog, whatever decided you're going to take down all of these points. It's a natural inclination to do it and it's also natural. Pick a fucking side. It's natural to decide. You see people aggressive in one direction. I'm going to be on the other side and say, fuck those people. Look at it again.

Speaker 4:          00:43:42       I'm just smoking the manliest pipe in the world. Don't mind me. How dope is that? SB pipe design on Instagram, talking about fucking society and Shit. Smoking a werewolf by Mr Rogen.

Speaker 2:          00:43:54       Well, you can't default on any of these loans. It's a trillion dollar debt. Well, that's a giant issue. Those kids getting fucked because it's a hustle. They tell you you have to do it and in some jobs you do have to do it, but you should probably think about what the fuck you wanna do with your life. Ultimately before you do it. I don't think it's a bad idea to travel overseas to experience some things, take some jobs, and then get some life experiences that, you know what, I'm leaning towards being a this or I'm. What interests me is that take the time to find out what gender you are. Don't let your out. If you bounce

Speaker 4:          00:44:28       to that. I spent 50 grand on a history education that I could gotten from Dan Carlin

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       for nothing or dude, yeah, he's on fire history. Florida case is sick. He's a bad motherfucker that Danieli about. He's. He's a history podcast. Guys, not reading books by white males for the next month to solicit. Just read more books of people of color. You can read what books by white people. Look the way I suggest, I suggest a five to one ratio. People of color makes no sense. Nigeria and a Filipino and like a three lock and have in common. There was somethings, not Jordan yet, person tweeted real recently, it was a huff post editor that was talking about her ultimate goal of home runs being white or less contributions being white, more contributions by people of color and women and she had like this whole breakdown in numbers, like the numbers that they've achieved of like how there is still working on it of getting rid of the white voice.

Speaker 3:          00:45:27       Just be the white guy. He's never done. That's the bottom line. What women do so much because I don't know any black people by the way. Who all the jibberish that you here you think of a single black person in my life that has ever demanded I say any of it or agree or never say shit that they're claiming 40 though. So there's like people like I guess my age and not. You know, it's generational too because if you were in the twenties, if you were hanging out with 20 year old kids, you'd be experiencing this will now. They went full circle, but they're trying to see your Dick. Doesn't matter though, with the racist, like I can't even believe it's a point where people with a straight face push segregation under the guise of anti, you know what I mean? Like safe space. So this is a colored space.

Speaker 3:          00:46:12       I'm like, you know, we had that in the fifties and shit. The Soviet Union, they do everything the opposite. It's doublespeak tolerance is authoritarianism. Well yeah, but say it again. It's the opposite. It's doublespeak where if you say tolerance, that means authoritarianism. No, it's what is, is it enforced tolerance? It becomes like a mandatory behavior pattern that you're supposed to like hate speech is free speech because this isn't who decides. Hey, why don't you got this being a stupid call I got, I, I have an obsession like explaining to people who haven't. You heard you on the show before, they don't know about your job. A witness, which I never thought. I never thought of it as a cult. Honestly. I never called them a call and I never really had an anger towards it. But when I think about it, you know, they didn't help. It didn't help my fucking family.

Speaker 3:          00:46:56       And only hurt. That's the thing with these religions, they never help. And that's what they should also seeds. Some, some religions I think can help certain people. I don't believe they don't. Especially men's helped nicest people on the planet. What I'm saying is the parts that helped were parts I didn't need the religion for. You didn't, but you haven't accelerated in mind. I saw people have their lie. I saw a guy who was a meth head mean this is my church. And he had bad teeth and shit. And then uh, his whole family came in and all of a sudden you got new teeth and they were like a happy and the. Oh, sorry, go ahead. See what I wanted to hear that story. That's what I'm talking about. No,

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       I've seen that happen. Like I don't think I'm an atheist at all. Like I, I have no, uh, uh, when you were under that truck, so when you were in that accident did contemplate like, oh my God, it might be going to heaven or I might be going to hell. I didn't even have time for that until we were just like, this is the end. I'll tell you why I felt good was it was so out of my control what was happening. I mean not one part because usually I think I'm going to die because I fucking did something, but like it was so out of my hands. That was comforting. Like I was like, oh, there's nothing. It's just your time when it's your time, man, and this one, it's not my fault. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. I'm like, oh, that's right. It's an versus me.

Speaker 4:          00:48:10       I'm like, I shouldn't have tweeted that is they're stabbing. I think this is. This is the creepy part because the job's witnesses and that guy with the teeth, he had a way to come back in, or my ex girlfriend that got caught shoplifting because all white girl shoplift. I don't know if you know that too, because no one would ever believe it was them passed with a rider was the queen shoplifting white girl because who would think she would do that? I wouldn't ask like why would they all do it? So they. And they all have, I've almost all white girls. I'm not sure. I mean my church, I'm sure there were sincere people fucking thing to do to shoplift birth control, birth tests. A Galley. You said date had a real issue? Yeah, she was a real addicted shoplifts. She got arrested hundreds of dollars of clothes and change into different things.

Speaker 4:          00:48:56       Put things on under clothes and walk out with them and well my ex got caught and she had to go and I didn't even know like, I don't even know why she didn't tell me. She was like, I didn't want to tell him. I'm like, I don't care. But she got caught and had to do community service I think in like Harlan and she was afraid to do it, but she said like people are walking up and thanking her for like picking up trash with the orange vest because people just skip out on it. Once you do the service, they wipe it from your record. Basically they offer. It's like you get caught, you're offered a way back where you don't have it on your record. It's on mark it. That's the thing that could work for somebody that's not going to be like, so religion has that.

Speaker 4:          00:49:28       If I wanted to go back and meet job as witness, I could go, listen, I was wrong. I, I missed being part of the truth, blah, blah blah, and I can get back in. These people have created a religion where they catch you in some minor mistake and they throw you into your advantage to Kramer island or whatever and they're fucking proud of it. And the only way you can move ahead as to catch someone else. So it's much worse than religion because there's no love or forgiveness of any kind. It's this empty button. The only thing that matters is your part of the right identity. I mean, it's basically just the racism as religion, but they use shame and that's why the only way out of it is to not care because shame is the only way to control people are your biggest ways you could control the other way. No, no. For the, uh, for the social justice warrior religion, like the way to do it. I think it's important. What you're saying is, um, that, that is the files, the same sort of patterns that these benches and find Jesus, it'd be happier. No gluten free. Jesus Christ. Oh fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:50:29       It's like what you experienced as a Jehovah witnesses the same thing like they, like we were talking before you got here about them trying to cancel Jordan Peterson speeches and these people were sending these emails and professors were sending emails, calling him a racist and a Nazi and saying he's a fascist and all these different things like. And what I'm saying is that when you ramp up the fake reality to the point where you, you're saying things you know aren't true, right, you think you're thinking of doing it for the right reason, to a purpose. They do it purposely. They think they're doing it for the right reason, but if they really aren't, they're not. They've really not a fan of Jordan Peterson. They would realize how crazy it is to say he's racist. How crazy it is to say he's transphobic or anything. He's not a Nazi by any stretch of the imagination. So he just doesn't tolerate nonsense. It's all it is. They want nonsense of course. So they're proving him right by calling him a Nazi.

Speaker 4:          00:51:18       Yeah, right. Well, it's just, look, this is why I think it'll just burn itself out eventually because. No Man, you can't keep throwing. They throw people, they throw their people away. You add Jamie Kilstein on recently. I didn't, I never will. They stick around like the hunchback and 300, you know, they're like, can I get back in? They don't, they don't really feel that. I know that guy from. I started comedy. Okay. And Jamie was always like, I think I talked with like a while ago talking about, but it was like, you know, he was always a dude that felt small that it was. I always got the impression his girlfriend made up most of, most of, most of him when I knew him that he met this girl he was married to and she put all that shit. She turned him into who he was because he just like a low self esteem dude, you know.

Speaker 4:          00:51:59       And uh, I mean I can relate to that. I can relate to a lie, that shit of where someone's like, all right, somebody feels bad and they want to be part of a group, but that's what I'm just fascinated by. How do you, for yourself? Like how do you make old? And he's telling me all his personal experience like Shit, some shit I won't share it with like he can't. But it sounded like being in a fucking religion and like when it went like dirty tests, there's literally like purity tests. Like you heard outside ideas you better not to listen to. It sounded so much like we were supposed to guard our hearts and like not even read certain things. You know, like if we had doubts not say them because you might stumble your brother out of the faith and that's the worst thing there is like, okay, just put the question side because God forbid you say something to put stout and Owen and then he falls out of the truth.

Speaker 4:          00:52:44       It's a clever little tactic. So they all do isolated. The reason they got to crack down on bullshit like comedy or whatever the fuck or your facebook or who give. If you give a shit about something, somebody tweeted, I mean you must be fucking stupid, but that's all of them ever hurts. Cognitive dissonance hurts where it's like Donald Trump is Hitler. Now give them all your guns. Then like that hurts your brain and so when someone shows you, say that again, I'm sorry. Smoking Pot. A lot of these same people have been all year, have been trying to convince everyone that donald trump's being run by the Russians and he's Adolf Hitler, and then the government should have all your guns. It's the same as being pro free market, but not acknowledging you're so stupid. Both of us did. I've certainly smoked myself. Stupid. Donald trump is. To me, he's the guy.

Speaker 4:          00:53:32       He's the perfect. First of all, the perfect president of America. This is. There's never been, and I mean for whatever party or in he is your Avatar, man. He is. He is the fucking, like everybody that thinks they can do a job that they can't do, but they saw something on tv, like I could probably do that better. Tell Him we didn't have an expert. Just a guy like very like, he's the candidate of the volunteer fireman of the gender studies professor of the fucking the vine star that became a comedian. Like all these people that think they can just walk into some fucking. He is that. Well that's our DNA. It's being like the earth is flat. Give me a boat. Is there a golden. I'm like my truth. And you all that shit like small. He learned from Lewis and Clark like though the original fucking two man comedy duo, we had to wait like the people that Lewis and Clark that the explorers.

Speaker 4:          00:54:24       No, she got a blood relative to that guy. How, how'd you know that? Did you go to one of those genealogy report? Now? My, uh, my dad told me he just knew. Oh wow, that's crazy. Who told him? Why am I Warren Pocahontas things? I took the genealogy tests. It turns out I'm gay. Is that, how crazy is that? Elizabeth Warren Lady? She was. She's insane. Well, I'll take a fucking. She won't take an ancestry test. She went to this class, you know, I will say this though. I hadn't gone on race racecourse long time ago. What the fuck is his name? Shawn, let me ask you this. Oh, what was built by? We're on this little Elizabeth Warren thing. Do you care about what? About whether or not she's really native American. She brought it up for. She took a job, like she robbed these job. She's at Harvard.

Speaker 4:          00:55:13       She got like one of those. She got a scholarship for being native American. She got a scholarship to how much native American and she pulled the Shaun King one 32nd. Yeah. But you have to understand something, and I didn't know this, uh, that should have blood quantum native Americans didn't have. You could be fucking. If I'm, let's say I'm a chief and I just adopt your Rogan. Joe Rogan is my son. He is now 100 percent part of my thing no matter what. His blood. They didn't get hung up on that. That came about to divvy up benefits, you know, after we like the real evil shit. We did. The natives was modern times back then. I don't, I mean that's what everybody did back then. I don't give a fuck, but in modern times you're absolutely right dude. But in modern times he did some very evil shit with them.

Speaker 4:          00:55:52       The blood quantum, that was what they're kind of cool about the most, uh, most native nations is they didn't get hung up on your amount of blood when you're in the family. And so you could be one like Johnny Depp when he said he got brought in the tribe so we could play Toronto. That's a legit thing in traditionally in native America, they were much cooler about racial shit. Like, like Europeans kind of brought that nonsense over more, but a kidnap people and people would stay with them. They better vibe the Sebastian younger detailed how many

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       people would leave Western society and joined the native Americans. I didn't know how much it was, like separate countries. See if they teach American history. That's what they should start at the very first whatever countries were here and then just move up through American because it's thousands of years. Shit, count them. They don't even count today. It's really interesting shit. Like I didn't know how populated it was. Like two, they were considered fauna in Canada until the sixties or it might've been Australia, but they were considered like fauna. Like, well I might be insane. Australia. Yeah. Australia. The aborigines, they have a terrible story. They. They was in the 19 I saw quickly and under guys kidnapped the average new babies and made them raised by white people. They took the babies from aboriginal families. It's like, where'd you get that baby? It's like, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:57:09       They did it like a concerted effort that we're going to try to create the. They decided they were going to symbolize people. I had my buddy Adam green tree lives over there and it'll show it. Yeah. He's born and raised and he works in mining companies, so he deals with all these different aborigines and they all have different languages. They call them. They're called a mob like instead of a clan or a town, they call themselves a mob. Really? Yeah, and they have. They might have a totally different name for things. As a guy that lives five miles away, five miles away, there's a bunch of totally different names and those people stick to themselves. These people stick to their selves, so the bands of them, hundreds of them all over the place and these. All these different languages are all the losing all of them.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       They're going to lose all these languages if these people get assimilated because they're not really written down in a lot of cases. Do you see that? It was on some fucking discovery. Maybe you know one of them fucking things, but the oldest human language, I think his case on people that got wiped out by the Zulus back in the day, like Shaka Zulu conquered them, but the case on their language is like the oldest thing they can find a k, a e song son Jay, I think. Whoa. But the old thing, there's this old ass lady who knew something about like the word and it was like, whoa. She's like, they come from animal noises, like the lion goes bra. And then the words they got came from mimicking. It was interesting as fuck. But it's. So, uh, it's such cradle of civilization shit. But the case song I think, I think that's like their languages.

Speaker 1:          00:58:41       The oldest like Prodo. Well, you know, monkeys have a language that's different, different sounds for different things. Like watch out, there's a lion is a different noise than watch out. There's an eagle. And these, these biologists or what would they be? Would they be, if they're studying monkeys, primatologists, I guess he's primatologists setup these speakers and played the sound of watch out. It's an eagle and all the monkeys fucking duct and went running down the tree and they played watch out. There's a line and they're all looking down, have a language. The language. They have a language and they play tricks on each other. Like one guy will say, hey, watch out. There's a line. And they all run up the tree and he gets the food. I told her I was

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       coming on. He goes, oh, you go, you guys get all pothead excited about the same still learning chair. Never gonna stop either. I don't give a fuck what anybody says. You can't shame me into getting not geeked out about like super volcanoes and shit. I'm going to freak out about it. I don't care. It's wicked exciting. It's fun. It's super volcanoes. I would love to. Oh, we already talked about one before you got here that killed most of the people. Seventy thousand years ago. We were talking about 70,000 years ago there was only 100,000 people. Oh yeah. Is this still a thing that said that? Like when they trace the jeans bag comes from like a population about 600 people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean there was probably at many times during our history we trembled dwindled down to a very small number two. It's crazy. It was really cold too.

Speaker 3:          01:00:10       Oh fuck man. Didn't half of North America under more than a mile of ice. And we made it through. We can make it through twitter guys, we can make it to throw it. But you, you gotta leave Anthony Jeselnik alone. You got to play this. How much weed has steered me off course. Do you know how many people in the last like two weeks and I mean having conversations about or shit in their lives are like a show and so unfollowed me on instagram and it was like weighing on them. Right. So follow me. How come you don't follow me on something? And I'm like do the greatest thing that media shit storm man. Cause I feel like I did everything you can do on social media by having that happen. I get, I got to the limits of social media for myself grabbing bandit. I'm so glad.

Speaker 3:          01:00:50       I'm so glad. I mean I put shit to promote on it but I was telling you that like I'm so glad not to be talking to people on fucking social media. The idea that I would give a shit and that's like adults, man, like grown adults. We're dealing followed me on instagram. Like just thinking who gives a shit of just blocked. You want to, I mean I just, I was too aggressive, but it's not even that, but there's no context but there's no context so it doesn't matter. There's no way to take it, right, because it's not being said. You could say it to somebody and they go, oh, I get what he's saying and let's say you, he even, he got the context. You're trying to be funny. Someone else is going to make it something that's not, that's what they did. It's such a.

Speaker 3:          01:01:32       and I didn't even, it didn't even occur to me dude. How much like quick sand, like, like people that shouldn't be allowed to make fucking eye contact with me that I'm, I'm having discourses with and Shit online. I mean just because you're getting your head the way pete to diet people like threatening to create whatever the shit you hear some fucking a college speaker complain about 10 times over. I had coming at me from you. I'm going to rape and murder your neighbor. It's explained. Most people that don't know this terrible thing where I said, hey, if you get raped, maybe go to the cops. On the way to posting it on facebook, that UCB has determined guilt in a rape case like nearly suggested. Hit the brakes. No one knows what the fuck you're talking about. So let's just explain the story to this.

Speaker 3:          01:02:17       Cost is so strong. It's very. I drink it. He was off the charts. He had one and a quarter and it is fucking to crank. I'm trying to counteract it with his indycar. I just want. I want people to understand the story. There was a guy that was accused of rape and you had decided like they shouldn't be tried in the court of public opinion on social media and what you said is why humorous wind, first of all, nothing with my friend. Somebody now not even defending him. I'm defending any but like how is this fucking cool that this is going to be tried on fucking facebook? Someone's sending random message. So and so has been found a ucb that noted clown college has done an internal investigation and term and so and so is guilty of rape. So if you have any information come in and that's on facebook.

Speaker 3:          01:03:02       Did they really say it that way? It was first in an online woman group. Then it got leaked onto regular facebook, but as a representative of the UCB that said that they didn't. It was some fucking girl on her own. I found out that's a big difference. Right. Like she said, the umbrella of UCB. Did she do it under the UCB twitter page or facebook page or other? I have no idea. It was from twitter or something. Whatever it is. I mean, she could have just been. I saw thought. I'm like, chase page. It wasn't even a thing. The problem is if you're saying the UCB did it and they didn't know they did not. They did not. Okay. She said that she said, but you said that you see be determined that it was. I saw a post that said that. Right, and this is from a person, but she said it.

Speaker 3:          01:03:47       The UCB didn't say it. No, it's not their official word at all. Right. Okay. So it's just a personal, very clear about that. They never claimed that it was a person who I think was like a rape counselor or something or somebody had to deal with like this. There's a bunch of like a rapey job. So something happened, performers, something happened between performance and this one guy was being accused and you said he just real simple without knowing who's guilty or not. You said he shouldn't be trying to call. Here's what happened. A guy that opened for me somewhere with friends with I go, Hey, can he call you now? First question, why call me right? What am I a noted rape investigator on facebook? I think just because I was somebody yelled, this is me not being aware of what to build it up.

Speaker 3:          01:04:28       I would just yell out on facebook about stuff and I had a following. So it's almost like a, Oh, like a can you talk to you and then throw your weight behind? I think it was like, eh, but um, you know, I didn't look at it as shit, facebook like that. Like it was like not, I don't understand like how people were looking at my facebook. It's ridiculous. But anyway, I talked to the guy on the phone and he told me something I think was a lie. I mean, you know, obviously I can't say one or the other, but looking back, I think when he told me was a lie that people were accusing them because he didn't book them on a show, which just doesn't really make a lot of sense so much. And with that quick to pull the trigger on a rate back, how evil they would have to be booked me, he fucking crazy. That accusation. I couldn't believe they would be involved in comedy but that at once together

Speaker 4:          01:05:19       at eight minutes, ah, make a 10 or else we got rape on our hands. So my point was just used guilty. This is worse because what you've done is handed somebody a lawsuit. You can't defame someone like that. And it's like you can just get sued for that. And also this is just to be convicted before you're allowed to say that legally. But to me it's not. I mean, it's like they're taking the campus thing of like where we're going to have a college campus say kick you out of school for that rape. You committed, talk over each other, but it's hard. That's not a punishment. That's not a punishment for rape is you get kicked out of school. This is gender studies. Bullshit trickling down into real life. Okay. So the colleges I assume wet. Let that, let that go on because they don't want to be known as a school where your daughter could get raped.

Speaker 4:          01:06:03       So they let these little groups pretend to have power and do a little tribunal and then everybody's happy. But we want to know what a rapist got expelled. That's their punishment. Great job. It sounds like the Catholic church transferring people, it doesn't sound any different. So this is someone to. So to me that was just like a garbage ass. If this guy's dangerous, go to the fucking cops. So, so uh, then I'm getting all this. People come to me about like, don't you dare tell a victim to go, I don't know. You're a victim yet though. That's the thing. Like when a victim says you're a victim, if you don't believe them, you're calling them a liar. We have to make sure you are a victim before we say one way or the other. So we're getting ahead of ourselves. But this is just basic due process shit.

Speaker 4:          01:06:41       I guess the argument is because historically this is like the argument on coming against me from finishing a historically, women are not believed, uh, which by the way, by who other women. Because what my experience is, is any woman close to me, they'd say she got raped. I probably believer and every man I know. In fact I know women that get dudes into fights over shit like that. Especially if you're in like white trash town where I grew up around like women are the ones that don't believe women. Men are the only people stupid enough to believe women most of the time. Okay. So that's already a bullshit thing that women aren't believed we. There's lynching. Rosewood, remember that shit that was [inaudible] a woman, a white woman was just believed. And then there's a bunch of lynchings of black people was. I think there's got to be instances we should be very measured about this because it's got to be instances in which women weren't believed.

Speaker 4:          01:07:27       Of course. Full spectrum has nothing to do. The idea is that you can't believe him every time. The larger point is you'd have to look at it as an individual case. Every case is individual and you look at it on it because that's fair. It doesn't matter. Let's say no woman in history has ever lied about rape once. Well, you still have to have due process in case it happens once. I'm not getting sacrificed to the state for the good of the fucking. You know what I mean? If it had shit happens, it does happen. It happens when you have something to lose. Like you're famous custody cases, rape case. Yeah, and news stories of this going uncritically believed when, when by the way with someone not believed in the media and and it turned out. I see a lot of people getting believed who lot.

Speaker 4:          01:08:13       None of it matters though because like I said, that has no bearing on my individual anything. Like we've cleared double standards, like when will just believe you and one will be super skeptical. Barry Barry crimmins like because he, you know, he, if you haven't seen that documentary, anybody listening, uh, call me lucky is really great because he, because that guy kind of heroic what he did with a aol. He basically, he was raping me was for which uh, uh, uh, I mean that's crazy what that would do to somebody and he, I think he told us talking about it onstage first or something and he ended up winning when the Internet was first becoming a nationwide thing, he was, there was child pornography everywhere, like pedophiles were by aol by the hour. If you are rich and you could just freely trade child pornography. So he had to testify before Congress, the Senate and AOL had a lawyer there because they didn't want to change their policy, which was three strikes and you're out for child pornography.

Speaker 4:          01:09:08       That's in the beginning. They actually with a straight face, like we have a from three strikes and you're out policy. Isn't that crazy that that was only like 1995 or 96 or something like that. It's just one of the best parts of the documentary because Barry's like, well, he told me, he's like, the guy says three strikes you're out. Goes, yeah, listen, I love baseball too. But I love baseball more than anybody but. But they, they, uh, the senators and congressmen were tripping over themselves in a manly display of being ignorant of technology or very like really is like a quotable dude, like the, he says, but they got lot. Oh No. It, all this Internet is. I just know that pornography is bad. Like some of them didn't know where the fuck they were. Robert Byrd is just like the age of pornography where he for a school age and at one point and the documents that he was talking about how it was almost like the other lawyer against him and it was who had better stage presence.

Speaker 4:          01:09:57       That's hilarious. Yeah. Where he was just clearly a better speaker. Like this really expensive lawyer was just like a shitty opener. Yeah. He was in bow and barry got to talk to testify, you know, he went over his time. He went over his time very. They had to change it. But anyway, I, uh, I wrote through him after that. I saw that document. It's like, well, that guy's fucking try me. And I was like crying from that documentary. Uh, well anyway, so I got the shit. All that shit came down on me. People are going to bury to get them to like denounce me, like I hardly knew him. So he called me up and uh, you know what, you have to realize a lot of this shit because he did real work helping people who rape victims. Kids were building like Batman Shit. Okay. And basically he fucking this shit's turf if you're a feminist or whatever political thing.

Speaker 4:          01:10:49       He goes, you understand this is turf to them. They don't give a shit about an actual victim. So like, you know, you'll try to do something good at helps someone and if you go to groups they could grab it and they use it as their little symbol or whatever. It's never about an individual person. I talked to this woman just a one way when at the height of things coming down on me for saying go to the cops and off facebook and always people I know, like the system has failed. Well you, I, I don't know that you didn't go to the system, so how do you now also, you're a white woman. I think it'll, it'll, but does want to call me to be fair. There's one to call me who wanted to. She want to get touched me some other creep inserted herself, like some blogger check who initially basically they baited me with these nonsense.

Speaker 4:          01:11:29       All you guys. That's what I'm saying. Watch on there because nobody's talking to you on there. Like having a chat or there's what I learned there. They're baiting you to get you to say something that they can. They can say, oh, I took down such and so and it. There's no. I'm, I'm from this dumb Colt, so I'm sincerely interested in peanut chatty cathy and people are not sincere. They they want to make a name for themselves, baiting you into doing something, get you in trouble, and they will fucking fuck with you is shit. You can't believe you'd be in trouble for saying such as. Go to the police and not fucking facebook if you're raped. So, so this woman called me in the thick of it. I don't know her name still okay. Because she didn't really know anything about me. They're telling her I'm a rape apologist, which thank you for putting that next to my name online for all time.

Speaker 4:          01:12:13       I have now crazy. It's just pop up around. It's just, it's just to put raped by. Explain what happened at the Improv the other night. Oh, this was a few months ago. I didn't know about some woman I've ever met in my life right after it happened. I think I texted you. I couldn't believe it. I, I, my manager assistant texted me a picture so somebody would giant glasses feel like you told me in person I might have, but she goes, do you know this person? I thought it was someone from Tim and Eric, like she was asking me about a cat. I don't know where I got now. Why Tim and Eric Personality, that kind of weird look, she's, she went in the Improv and said, Kurt Metzger raped me. I'm here to confront him. And uh, yeah, they said she was visibly not right. Like it wasn't like, I mean, but just someone throwing that around casually.

Speaker 4:          01:12:55       But that's because she, they put, they make these little shitty names. Like what the fuck is that? There's no such thing as that. Okay. No one's pro fucking Reiki magic. There's someone out there go. What's the little rape? Yeah. No, I've never met a person out there that's doing that is if you don't accept no for. Yes, same thing. Yeah. If you don't accept every tenant of fucking white girl Taliban feminism that you love rape, that's the fucking org. It's like, it's like arguing with a girlfriend that you should have dumped three years ago. It's a bad relationship except you're not dating it so hostile because this is because there are going. We don't even know they're so into this identity shit. You know what it is? Yeah. I think part of it is um, social media of course. I think all of these attacks and shit or antisocial, they're like weird.

Speaker 4:          01:13:54       The way people would talk. Well, it's tricking these girls to the thinking. They're going to have their little angry black guy moment. But here's the thing, you're not like black people. You're not like a suppressed marginalized minority, feminine. I don't know where they're getting that from. You are absolutely not an identity of women together. And here's how I know they proved that at the women's March when they kicked the prolife women out. See Black people have to take all, all their garbage. Black people they have to take in their movement because it's still don't doe, but black people have to. They're forced to, to, to bargain like a minority. I get that women are half the population got fucking women's March. They kick out the prolife women. That's a luxury you have when you're not in the press minority. That's when you have it pretty good.

Speaker 4:          01:14:35       We don't know what like what is minority mean? Like being one in 10,000. That's the Asians. That story though. That's crazy that they know that. No, I did not see if you can find that Jamie. Yeah. They want to see some footage. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if there were like kicking a woman. Yeah. Like you're not an oppressed minority. If you can afford to kick out the prolife women this March. It's a crazy time too. I mean objectively with no political leanings left or right. It's crazy when they're kicking out. The people that are saying don't kill the babies. I now look at what it is. I mean, I'm not saying you shouldn't do it, but what is it about. You were a boarding. Well, you know what will eventually be at these are people that fundamentally refused to acknowledge. It's like watching people that you get divorced.

Speaker 4:          01:15:21       Argue the argument. I've tried to argue this patient because like, my mother doesn't hate women. She's a Christian lady that thinks it's murder. I think, hey, maybe you're killing a baby. I don't give a fuck I. it's not my baby. Go do what you want. The anti, the pro choice or intense. I don't care. I don't give a fuck. Like, listen, if you're the kind of person that can do it, they maybe you should do it. You know, like, I, I don't give a shit. It's not, it's not a fucking uh, uh, that's you and your God does to, you know, so, but you know, conversely also if you have your kid, I also don't give a fuck about your kid and if I don't have kids, I just don't, I don't think that it to you, but I'm just saying, I'm not like [inaudible] you're a different amount of caffeine.

Speaker 4:          01:16:03       Bra is so jacked up. Why is the women's March excluding pro life women? Well this is the week now. Wait, are they get. Oh, you should find someone that's saying a should do on it. But once I listen to the bottom line is they go and I have talked a million times to people that talk about they go. It's either somewhat always emotional, the person you're talking to and it's a, they want to control my body as a woman. And that's why they're anti abortion. I'm like, no, they think it's baby murder. No, they want to control my. Then you talked to the other people like they want to have an immoral lifestyle and Blah like really gets broken down. Is that one sentence a woman's right to choose. Like you don't even say to choose what I keep going. Like they cut it off because it sounds uncomfortable.

Speaker 4:          01:16:42       It's a woman's a woman's right to choose to abort a baby. Right. And I think it is. That's not my right. That's pregnant. I would decide if I'm fucking avenue I couldn't care about. I'm like Nah, I'm going to decide. I could only put myself in so much choose if that's what I'd watched. So that's why I'm for so. But. But rovy Wade is a very excellent compromised, by the way, it's late term abortion. See the late term abortion is fucking gross and I understand if it's a miserable fucking defect, fine. But if you look at the numbers and it's very hard to get accurate abortion numbers because it's so politicized. The late term abortions are not as I would have thought because of deformities. It's a lot of times they either didn't know they were pregnant or just hit like, it's Kinda shitty bro. You can see the wrong man. But like I said, if you as a mother could do that that late, Eh, maybe you shouldn't raise a kid, you know? Uh, but, but early on, I don't think you're murdering anything. Like, or if you do it early, I think, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:17:39       it's a, it is a slippery conversation though. And this is what people who are ideologically attached to that left wing dogma, they're not willing to have this conversation. So if you have these pro life women, they don't want to have a dialogue like their mind is completely,

Speaker 4:          01:17:56       well, they better listen. Here's my other thing is just be consistent if you're pro life because the Catholic church is at least consistent prolife, they're anti death penalty. Okay. They're pro life. They were against the Iraq war, like, okay, go down the last birth control. Yeah, because you're supposed to bring more light. So at least you're teaching is consistent. I can't see in these people that are like, no, if you want to have your right wing, no social welfare state, you're going to have to fucking allow abortion because you're gonna have to take help. Take care of these fucking kids. Are you willing to do that? Some of them are, but a lot of them are not, and by the way, if we went and blew up Iraq, Ms Dot Christians that wanted to do this, there's Kelvion Christians. They're okay. They're like the original fucking Christians there have babies at their collateral damage. You call them and that's, that's fine. It happens, but okay. What's the difference between that and some woman in New York? The collateral damage of on the way to her career, she doesn't have the baby. If you accept that OSCE dropping bombs on somebodies fucking pregnant wife and killing their unborn baby because it's convenient for us. Thanks. Shut the fuck up about someone getting an abortion because you're a hypocrite. Control life down the line.

Speaker 2:          01:18:57       Well, yes, that's a very good rant and true. Yeah. Well I can't go on facebook anymore. I'll get in trouble. That's a very good rant. I mean, what you're saying is right. If the people are very convenient, it's very inconsistent. I think you're absolutely right. Bitter. I'm bitter for my religion because I'm the sucker that would believe it. Right? It would dawn on me later. Oh yeah. We don't actually do that. We're just, you know. No, you can't fudge chip on your shoulder because of that. And you and I have had this conversation a bunch of times because you'll say, I know what these people are trying to do with their words. I remember this shit from when I was told the same thing. I'm a suppressive person, right?

Speaker 4:          01:19:31       Or an apostate. Joe Is witnesses. I'm always in a positive thing. It should be an ally castle title. Well, because dude, I get a good title. Ooh, I like it, dude. 12 apostates. I get fucking, uh, uh, really upset by that group. Like, don't stumble your brother once, once. The truth is just saying, telling the truth. It's not in the interest of the group to tell the truth. That's really upsetting. It just really gets under my.

Speaker 2:          01:19:58       Well, it should. It's like what we're talking about, it brings back the same thing as Jordan Peterson thing when they're calling him a Nazi and they're calling him a transphobic. I understand. He's a professor at the University of Toronto.

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       It's become very famous for battling against Social Justice Warrior Ideology Online, specifically them imposing in one of their bills and Canada. The you have to use someone specified gender pronouns and there if you. If you don't do it, it could be thought of as like a human rights violation. Will they have those human rights courts, the human rights councils up there. It's subtle counselor. It's a very different thing. They don't have freedom of speech. It's not the same as free speech is kind of an American thing, but what it talked about it. What would it be? Pronouns like Faggot, like if you have to say that because that would also be hate speech. It's like this weird. Circle me my word, so it can't be a pronoun you parents or identity. There's some control over what the pronouns will be like. You could probably say you're a storm trooper, right?

Speaker 3:          01:21:01       You could probably get crazy, but you probably can't say you're a Faggot, but what if that's your identity, like who's to say what your identity is? Your identity cannot be an offensive word it because your identity is lashing out, hurting other people. What if you identify as white CIS male? That's it. I'm a white cisgender gay. I got no problem. I'll call you whatever the fuck you want. I got no issue with that. No issue. Forced, forced. He was saying he was battling against it very early on and almost everything he said would happen is happening now in terms of this overreaction culture. Welcome. By the way, how come that's. Remember Jamie Kilstein had had a capacity of about it that a white boy blues song he did and he goes, oh, I don't know what this means, and I go, Jamie, I know you got to put everything on the white males.

Speaker 3:          01:21:48       Now that's like the religion, but do you want us to believe anyone outside of a young white male knows what the fuck's? This means like where I used to live in Washington heights in New York. I want you to go out and talk to any of Dominicans on the corner and go, do you know you're a CIS male? Right. And ask her if they know what the fuck that means. They'll stop you. You have to be a white super recent thing. Plus gender is supposed to adopt it. Like, okay, I'll tell you what you want, but why you get to pick my title. It's also nonsense words. It's a Marxist. Marxism does it alliance and if you agree to nonsense, that's one step closer to dominance. That's where everyone knows. Yeah, it is really like a religion. You're right. It's a consensus based religion which is really being Vegan is kosher.

Speaker 3:          01:22:31       Is it that people fall into that so easy because they come to comfortable by. Barry told me that I didn't understand the level because people fucking hate themselves. That's why they're online creating these new identities and shit and if you don't hate yourself, because I. before I had that, that media shitstorm I, I had, I had alright guys would fucking try. They all did different things to try to ruin your life. Like would be people pose it. Alright guys like to be a fake you and then go to people you kind of know like John Daly, who I'm like, I know I'm bound. No one where like, and then as you say, some fucked up shit. And then they think like that's the John Daly, the golf guy. Now they'll give you from kroll show. He's pretty funny. Dude. Actually he's on the uh, you. He always is in shake daily.

Speaker 3:          01:23:17       Daily. You've seen him in shared. Trust me, he's got like a square head. Okay. But uh, uh, but fine, whatever. But they will go at him a fake me. Oh, when Patton Oswald's wife died, somebody as me sends them a thing with his dead wife. Photoshopping the ghostbusters poster. Can you say your shitty on? Because they all. The whole thing was you're not. You don't know what's funny. So don't. If I tell you, you know, there's that whole joke thief shit. I'm like, listen, I, I was there. And also I know comedy and I know better than you jerk off at home. So if I tell you just know, think I know better. I'll just put it that way. Maybe that's arrogant, but I just been doing it for 20 years and you never had the balls to get on stage. So I think I just know better.

Speaker 3:          01:23:54       They're outta here. You're fighting with someone who's not even here. I started some jokes. He fight. No one has any idea what the fuck you're saying, right guys is when I defended amy, amy and I had people like lecture and I'm like, don't listen, don't presume to tell me Shit. But. But they're outraged. But at the same as the social jihadis, they all think the same reason I became a comic. I could do that, but at least I did it. You know, if you get on stage and do it, I'll give it to you. But these people think they can do your job, but hold on a second. In their defense, they're looking at a film that shows time after time that daddy made specifically fuck her because she said, I play a racist Republican. The little youtube video where they took movies fuck in the show. Which by the way, she doesn't write the show. It was ridiculous and it was exactly what the fucking sjws did to me where they don't like you. They think you have an agenda. They got to destroy. So they create this fucking, uh, uh, uh, you know, it's like a smear job.

Speaker 3:          01:24:55       There were bits that were exactly the same, very mediocre bits that thought off, dude, relax, relax. I drank. I Cave Man Nitros, and you're talking to me this way. I do. I know this, but you're going to run through the wall. And then there's a crick shaped and print content. So get a caveman nitrile you're, but you're, you're arguing against someone who's not even here. Why they are going at me. That's what the problem with what you're saying is they have evidence. They're looking at one bit. That's a good point. Where if I look at the evidence and I come to a different conclusion, let's go with my conclusion because I was there. A process guy. That's not enough. That's not enough. That's not enough to convince someone, oh, just trust me. You think of authoritative sheriff type Shit. Just trust me.

Speaker 3:          01:25:49       I'm not going to them. They're coming to me, trust me, I'm watching this video, I'm watching these jokes. They're being repeated. You're saying, just trust me. Chokes. You taught. I'm talking about sketches piece get claimed were taken, which is nonsense. I was in the room. I left the fucking cop of the room with that shit. That doesn't mean that you know and watch mad TV and stop. That doesn't mean anything because the bits still got on the air. So you what I'm saying like you might not have been happening. It doesn't matter. That's what you have to say. That's not what you say. Say that. No, no, no, no, no, no. But that's not a job you can't, but you can't say that. These people don't have actual examples of the same bits over and over again. If they're parallel thinking, that's fine, but it has to be related.

Speaker 3:          01:26:33       But you didn't really see this, this whole thing about this. I'm very confused, very confused. The whole thing from the top down. Look, I don't give a shit about it. By the way, if they see the evidence, right? You have to like, you have to be real clean, real confrontational when you're, when you're handling something like that. I won't. First of all, number one, the larger issue is I'd never should be on social media talking to any of these. Fucks it all explaining it. I don't owe any of you anybody listening. If you have a question or a judgment, I don't owe you an explanation for shit. I understand. I know where the fuck you got the idea that I do so I was wrong. I even fucking at any answer at all because you have people. Hey joke thief. Really? That's the word about me that I'm a joke thief from some no, nothing and they just want to see.

Speaker 3:          01:27:21       I'll talk back to them to these animals that you did steal it and you got to explain how this was parallel. Thank you to be many times I did. I know, but a lot of people haven't heard it and you're blurting it out like that. Someone's arguing you in the room. I'm just pro rape. First of all, you guys. Here's one thing I want to be clear. I am probate, a rape apologist. I'm. I'm pro rape, rape and apologize for one thing. I know Duke. Yeah. I'm only bringing it up. Why? Why? I was getting shit. Getting Shit for defending amy from these. Right. I understand. But it's also because you're confronting them. Like you're. You're confrontational. Yeah. I liked. I like being online and also it seemed like of no consequence to me. I'm like, I got all this other shit going on. I can put one your hand sit here and hit to your dumb shit.

Speaker 3:          01:28:12       I was like cocky. I understand. I understand. But what I'm saying is from the perspective of someone who's a standup fan, my hand is trembling from the Matrix. That's crazy. It's got some serious shit. What the fuck is in this 270 milligrams? Caffeine? You probably had some coffee earlier to see you do twitter like me where you think it's almost like the candy crush of words and then before you know what I just pissed off uber or some shit. Listen, I'm speaking as a cave. A nitrile caveman to you. You're saying though is like a person who's a fan of comedy and I am a fan of comedy. When I see like if I. If I was never a standup and I saw this all going down and I was a Kurt Metzger Fan, I would want Kurt Metzger to explain to me what happened. I would want you, your, your specific words on this because you were

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       a writer over there, so like as a fan, I would want to know. I think Kurt Metzger is a hilarious creative comedian. I want to know how this happened. For you to say it defensively, to brush it off and say that you know better than to tell you why? Because the way someone would come at me immediately like who we have, why are you speaking to me this way? So defensive. You already defensive. As soon as I have somebody coming at me a certain way, like just your natural mode course. Naturally, dude, I found out that that's one reason why people think I'm a psycho is because I'll react to that and no one else sees that guy. Yeah. They don't got a psycho from reading your twitter isn't enough to do is read your tweets will hold on cause I got way off track of what I'm trying to get to, but just what you said, that girl.

Speaker 4:          01:29:49       So, so what I'm saying, hey go, maybe go to the cops and, and don't on facebook announced to a rape verdict. I had this. I'm not gonna even say her name because he's people benefit. Every time I fuck mentioned them. Just go right to this idiotic blog at night we have a back and forth. I mock the stupid language of her stupid. She said asking for any details of what happened is like reshaping the victim. Just belief. And I go, so I go, that's like I said the word rape hole in a post mocking her language. Okay. She deletes her comments, takes what I wrote and goes to these chicks that say they're like, look what he said about you.

Speaker 4:          01:30:25       Nobody cares what anyone is saying to you. You're the person that they've heard of. So they only care what you say and there's no context. They just go. He said rape whole. Go ask somebody what I did that's wrong, but they won't be able to tell you and they'll go, well that he said something. Re poll is that's all they have. Is that proven? Do you have screenshots of the original tweets? A? No, because then people complained. Not only could I not because I don't delete anything that I put up. Markers were moved. All of that. Facebook has removed all that because the people I am offended so I can't even go back and show any of the facebook took it down. Oh Wow. But even if she didn't take fucking shit off, it doesn't matter. Like nobody's reading her shit. They don't give a fuck.

Speaker 4:          01:31:06       Which he's saying. They're like, oh, the writer for Amy Schumer show is saying, and that's what all these people can't believe. It's so easy to access you and fucking have. You get a reaction to them and they're amazed. They can't believe it. They're like, I can talk to the fucking me and the TV and they've built an industry around it, so if you speak to them at all, you're a sucker dude. If you have any emotion about this, you're. I mean, you're a fucking soccer. Don't just don't get suckered. That's all I'm saying. Same thing happened to me with that, the Black Panther stuff, because I was just doing the reverse of any marketing to Black Panther, Black Panther, Black Panther. I was like, finally I'm movie with black people for black people, so I was just like, no white people in it pass. Who do I relate to that really? Because I know what you're talking about. Oh, that was like the whole thing. And then a couple of people like Jeffrey Wright, the actor and Don Cheadle, they start reacting like I was serious and I started being like, this is sad. Tired, man. I'm just

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       doing black mirror. She guilt. Did you feel like a little cool that you got don cheadle? Jeffrey, did he say to you, who's like, how do you think it feels to me? I'm like, Dude, how do you think it feels? What? Finish the sentence. Sorry Matt. I'm a little jacked up to his energy. Got Me really good. How would you feel watching, you know, growing up as a black man and watching I only white movies and I was like, dude, I had Michael Jordan on my wall. I love Karl Malone and Kung Fu movies by way. Still got a point. You still got a point. I mean, the problem is that he didn't take it as satire, but he's right to. The problem is you weren't, you weren't being serious. You were cracking a joke about how people are reacting to this movie. I love it because they're black and it's black dude.

Speaker 1:          01:32:47       I'm at the worst level of being known where like I have reached, but I'm not famous enough for people. Like he's a comedian. No. You brought that up when I got fucked. It's like not famous enough to be like, fine. Famous enough to get fucked over. Like I'm big enough where someone wants to hunt me, but like, no one's like, oh, oh, one bedroom in the comedian. Some of them are like, oh, we must work for a college hr departments. By the way, did you see the Black Panther? No, no, it's good. It's pretty fucking good though. Annihilation. I want to see that. Yeah, dude, that's a trip. You don't spoil it, but it's. I won't. But from that [inaudible] guy, the guy made a watch that if, if this was such a racially uplifting movie, first of all, his name, his first name wouldn't be black. The Black Panther. That wouldn't be in the Black Panther forever. Yes. It's like a fucking exploitation saying shaft is like Selma. Like when do you think they came up with a Black Panther? 16.

Speaker 1:          01:33:43       By the way, panthers are black already. You don't need to specify that unless you're letting me know. The guy under the suit is black. Well, you know what it actually is. It's a Jaguar. It's the Jaguar that has spots everywhere instead of just some spots because Jaguars some Jack. They're not really totally black, like a black panthers kind of. It's. It's not like scientific drama. You can't find a black jacket for they. If you see the black ones, you could still see like some faint outlines of like those Jaguar little dots and circles. It's kind of funny. I like David attenborough does almost make it seem like black panthers are more hostile. They were like the black panthers stocking is pray. Well, the snow leopard is as elusive as he is. Grateful they're all jaguars. Is there? Yeah. I think the black ones probably evolved to be more successful hunting at night because you can't see a god damn thing at night in the jungle. You don't know what black is, I would imagine until the jungle. No, but I've been to the Pacific northwest. I'm into those essentially rain forest up there, like there's some parts of the Pacific northwest that are insane at night too. Right? Like you can't believe how dark it gets because you don't see shit. It's dark in at noon.

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       When you go through the woods, it's dark. Like you won't get a Tan. It could be fucking new. Now it can be 85 degrees out and it's dark walking through those woods because this canopy of leaves and super dense tree growth, like it's dark. It's fucking night. You must just hear these crazy noises. Oh yeah man. Like elk sound intense. They're intense and you just hear the sound like a dude. Where's my point about it being dark there? I told about the Black Panther, Black Panther, the ones most likely in the jungle. It's the same situation and the ones that have the darkest or the less likely to be seen and less likely or more likely to be successful because there attack ambush predators. They sneak up on things and Jack, um, what else do they do to deer and fucking people to that spirit is what the king of Wakanda has come into to become the Black Panther.

Speaker 3:          01:35:45       I thought it was technology. That's actually pretty cool. The suit is, I think the coolest part of the movie because it builds your forcing hit you back like the dope. But then his other part of his power is they have this, this giant they make from flowers and he lays down and they, I swear to God, they give him a purple drink. He drinks a purple drink. Oh Jesus. That's where he gets his other powers. Oh, Jesus Christ. Guys watching this ad from the comic book to the Purple Drink. I'm like, when they make this, are they even because they're making it like, you know, it's like guest star fucking Maya Angelou was giving them the purple drink, Jewish guys. As long as no whites were involved. It was an exploitation comic. It's two Jewish guys from the seventies, like that's when it came out to put it out.

Speaker 3:          01:36:28       Like finally, you know, let's get the origins of the Black Panther Comic Luke Cage. That was already out and that was a fucking awesome. I think that is superman. If they were like, what would a ghetto superman. Almost like the old joke, but it's fucking great. I do. Luke cage was cage gets to fuck. Jessica Jones. He. Yeah. Yeah. Little interracial romance going on up in that Netflix. He has to super fucker because they're both super fucking each other. They're both reconstituted. Grind, your pelvic. The dust. He's fighting gentrification. Well, she sees him beat the fuck out of some dudes in a bar and realizes that he's one of them and that she's been. She's a mutant and he's a mutant. They get together in Buton Saxon. Fucked up the bed. Spoiler alert, alert. He can lay pipe awakened. Looks like a guy who could lay pipe the pipe. If you look at them, you go, I bet that guy. That guy's was sex scenes. Was there a rumor that they really were having sex on camera work? It was a big one in that movie. Angel Heart. It's never been true time that natural at all. Angel Hearts. Never true. I think if Donald Sutherland in that killer midget movie, they say Mickey Work Really a bank. Kim bessinger and nine and a half weeks, but he did. He, I don't know. I wasn't there. I like to believe like, I mean you're so anti religion. You don't even want to believe rumors.

Speaker 3:          01:37:57       I'm not buying it is witness. Let me tell you this. It's like that. And I stopped at a crack. My back was fine. My first, by the way, my first joke ever similar to that really, but I was like when I was 11 and my block and Uncle Charlie, they used to rape me everyday and he would go, if you ever tell anybody what I did too, I'm going to kill your parents. And I told everybody as your first joke, I told everybody he never killed. My parents are, you know, don't we have to deal now? All black audiences do not enjoy that joke at all for the fucking weird looking for a white guy. Did Not enter laughing at that. They little different. Yeah. Yeah. But, uh, I will say best thing, don't we started out in those rules because there was a crowd. It wasn't other comics that were waiting to get on.

Speaker 3:          01:38:55       Right? It was a fucking audience. And uh, it, it Kinda, you couldn't be precious. Yeah. The fucking perform, you know, like you couldn't be one of these like hanging in the back pocket. Oh Dude, you can't. No, you gotta perform you gotta paint. Yeah. And so, and you didn't have to fucking talk black. We just be very confident in your own whatever. And crowd will go with it, you know? Yeah. Just speak funny. Just be funny. There was a big can bring a notebook. They see it as weakness. They're like fucking notebook. I see it as weakness. Did do your homework. Yeah. But there's some rooms where they're like, oh, that means it's like brand new. His writing, he's working on shit today. The worst is when someone pretends they're reading their notes and they do the same bits over and over again. Like you can't.

Speaker 3:          01:39:38       You just pretended. You just looked in that book and the name for now. What else? This one. What else? What else? What else does that? I'm like, I could do your act. Well, it's just like people in the audience like, Hey, don't don't do that. You know, Jay, right. Big J. sure. Were these people called them comics, but I a comedy pause when they're not really saying like spinning the wheels. Trying to get some traction. Yeah. There's some new thing that I think people have mistaken laughter for support or like a pr or do you stitch you say that to me, they mistake it for applause. W they've confused laughter and applause. You know, it's an ideology versus like laughter's. When someone relates applause is when someone agrees. Well there's too many people that are trying for applause. Right. My point is like the. You're supposed, this is only supposed to be funny, like when you're just trying to like say a bunch of Shit and memorize it and say it real fast and then to get a big applause at the end.

Speaker 3:          01:40:39       Like that's. Do you remember? Like, dude, I'm not trying to change policy. I'm starting to laugh, but I was a kid. I remember like Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy is the biggest county in the world and it's funny when it in the eighties, I remember watching stand up. It seemed more integrated or something like in the eighties and I swear to God like when the evening at the Improv in a comic strip live or on tv on like Friday night or that's what I used to watch stand up comedy when I was like 11 or 12. And then the nine like death. I remember when def jam came out and I remember it was like, and also racially a lot of shit seemed more segregated and it was like, I think the beginning of just marketing to specific, uh, you know what I mean? Like oh here's an all black show.

Speaker 3:          01:41:19       And, and these had jokes on Seinfeld about it, like Seinfeld's market was being eaten away with def jam. His mother sang it to him and I didn't think of that, but that was the beginning. So now it's like everybody just specifically, you know, I like to hell. It was like kind of grab bag. When I'd watch standup it would be like, you'd see like a Ventriloquist, you'd see like, you know, Eddie, Eddie Murphy kind of person and like some fucking real dry person. There'd be like La and it was more mixed on its own. And I, you know, well, I'll tell you the solution, I think we should do some of those, like a Rodney dangerfield type specials I called Rodney would do a special on thinking of also. But that dude, we should do it also. A lot of us, uh, you know, if you're going to put out a special, it takes you a couple of fucking years or a year solid to have the material locked down, rock and roll.

Speaker 3:          01:42:10       But if you're going to do 15 minutes, I think you're a minimum by the way. Sometimes that's not enough. I agree. Great. Nice. I agree. I've been doing a year and a half in between specials and I think that's the right amount of time. I've got a nice juicy now two and six months that either, because that's shit gets hammered down like a Samurai warrior with Louis on his website and the fucking point is like if there's more of those 15 minutes sets, like you could come up with a 15 minute set and a couple of months. Right. You know, you really could, it would be locked in. Right? Right. And so if you were, if you were doing something like that, you could do that, like get a prepared set over like three or four months and have, hey, you know, we're going to be filming, we'll film some of them here, we'll film some of them like three months later.

Speaker 3:          01:42:59       So you'll know you'll have it all locked in. You'll know when to go do that with a white precious. I couldn't, I didn't have a booking agent for the road. I switched managers and I was like we can't take him until he fucking does, uh, does the hour. But I'm like, I need to work the hour out, so I had to do it in 15 minute chunks around the city and just do a lot of city spots. Oh Wow. Which is, I'm happy with how it came out, but I mean it was so fucking nerve wracking because I'm like, I know I'm not preparing this properly. Right, right, right. Because I have to do these 15 minute chunks of the material. The really why didn't you catch yourself on the road? And like small cloud had been writing a lot and I just like, like I said, I switched managers and I didn't have an agent, a book and I don't know how easy it was to book you at this point. Once I, once I have all these people were like, well, you know, I'd banished to Kramer island. I couldn't get them to do shit for me. I found out it's actually very easy to go book. Like

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       people actually wanted to book me everyday. It turns out not everybody is in this dipshit Colt. Uh, the way it seems when you like online a lot. Well, I just think if you can clearly explain yourself and you can feel like, well, I didn't realize you don't get to see. I used to go, yeah, they could do it without you. They don't need you present to fucking you up is whatever. I thought, oh. Then they will go. Kurt, what did you say? They don't. They don't even bother with that, but they don't care. A lot of people just want to burn. You just saw your media is based on this conflict now and the patrice used to say, I like, they always need us to be at war, so they need men versus women in white for. They always need that going all the time.

Speaker 4:          01:44:30       What district are you talking about? People that sell that piece of shit. Did you watch that documentary about Gallcher and Hulk Hogan? No, I did not. Oh my God, it's on Netflix. If you got to see it because it's amazing. It. It's very heavily skewed to make you feel bad for Gawker, but it doesn't. It actually makes you go, are you shitting me? Gawker, like, feel bad for cosby. It's like, dude, you can't tell me that I feel bad for fucking body think it's designed to make you feel because they're like so whole cogan basically because Gawker, this is how the news media like that despicable shit they did to Louis and the New York Times, which shouldn't. The New York Times is now fat girl's diary basically like they never should've been allowed. My girlfriend made that up. I didn't make that. That's very funny. And he said Damn Shit. And he's very funny, but that's what it is.

Speaker 4:          01:45:17       And nonsense. I mean like if you read the article, there's no crime. People just make up what? Like what did Louis Do? I used to ask like when that should happen to him, I go, what's it Louis do wrong? And they go, well one time at work my boss grabbed my tit. I have my actual friend says to me, I'm like, I'm sorry I asked you what Louie did. It's not about that. We're going to use him as a fucking symbol because what did he do wrong? Ask for consent for non in like what are you talking about? Like why would that have to come out and why would that be anybody's business? It's to make him look like he's a Weinstein for comedy. Like Harvey Weinstein. Right? And by the way, Harvey Weinstein, that's the old casting couch, which I'm like, good, get rid of that shit. But they tried to paint Louis up a stand up comic as if he's a producer director.

Speaker 4:          01:46:01       Like it is a conflict of interest. If you have a producer come to my room, they're like, hey, but another comedian at a festival, it's reasonable. Thank you. Might be fucking because you're not on a different. The power level. We're comedians. We don't work for a corporation together. Okay, we're an independent company and make companies can fuck with each other. But also that what it was is just a weird thing that he liked to do and what they made it out to be is like a sexual look. Like he's fucking a Predator and there was no such anything. He doesn't never surprised. People jerk. And now I'm going off what Louis told me. By the way, I believe lily, by the way. Oh my God. You're supposed to believe women. There's a whole new thing. What kind of an imbecile me to. I mean, first of all, there's no woman on this earth who is stupid enough to just believe women like women know way better.

Speaker 4:          01:46:48       So I'm just imbecile. People are always like, oh, I just that you're a woman is not evident exhibit a, but you do have to admit it's kind of weird to just do like an impromptu whack off sash. Yeah, it was. It is weird unless you're talking about sex shit back and forth like Weinstein, but it's. You start whacking. You told me. That's a point that you told me. Tell the lies of omission. First of all, just, well, I'll just go with the article because I don't know what trouble I'll get in anybody's name, but just read. Listen, just read the fucking article. Okay. There's nowhere where it says there in Houston. He says, Hey, will you watch me masturbate? Somebody said, no, you didn't masturbate. They went and said something reported or whatever. Supposedly, and by the way, the story of that that I know more about, it's despicable how they frame that. The guitar comic thing, absolutely despicable how they frame that.

Speaker 4:          01:47:39       Anybody read the article? Nobody did. Right? Nobody reads the read. I read it. He literally did nothing. If you read John, nevermind what I would know personally, just read the article. Nobody bothered to. So all this nonsense that everybody put out of him. Surprised whacking off. That's not even in there. Okay. Like, like it's the first one is the guitar duo that people thought were Garfunkel and oates because all these young kids can't imagine anything happening before. Who took guitar? Duo that Louis supposedly jerked dot. You don't remember this now. That's why a lot of shit hard duo that really jerked off in front of the New York Times was like, dude, I saw like some of the headlines and saw some people commenting it online. That's okay. What do you just let me ask, what do you guys think Louie did that he got in trouble for?

Speaker 4:          01:48:23       I'm just, I'm just curious. Someone to master if he could masturbate in front of him and then did it. They said yes and he did it. That's it. Essentially asked it to people who said no and they felt very uncomfortable and they had to work with them. Right. That is the sexual harassment aspect of it. That's the difference. Like if you're on a TV set, right? That's the only one that I went. I'd read and went, wow, that's crazy. But you were telling me something. Yeah. I don't know what I'm not going to. He could say what he wants to explain what I'm not gonna Take Shit. That's what he told me. No, no need no need to. But I'll just add to the story. Yeah. And, and, but there's a flat out agenda here. Now what's the agenda to ruin a guy who. Well, I mean he's Mexican now. I know it doesn't help his case.

Speaker 4:          01:49:08       This is like the Taliban, this shit now. Like they have to. I bet he's a fucking Buddhist statue that has to be exploded. Do you understand? We now have to take all these unfunny people. Okay. That for political reasons and you can't have evidence. So if someone being funny that fits in the wrong group, there's no styling. Kill his fucking leg. See is like every band that ever achieved anything, they got to remove it. So we're gonna throw Louis away. Louis Ck. We gonna throw him away with Harvey Weinstein. I'm sending you right now. Jamie. You got to put the shit up. You're going to cry. Yeah, no, you're right. And in some ways that, uh, there's,

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       there's a Taliban going on, but if a guy like Harvey Weinstein existed, you know, there was a real fucking problem for a lot of people for sure. A hundred percent. In fact, Hollywood's fucking despicable. Both things. What you're saying is true. And that's true, but the idea that another comedian, because back when this happened at Aspen, it was not a fucking. He was a comedian who was a few more years ahead. Then these two girls that were also comedians. I've been at festivals and had sex with comedians. This is outrageous, but you should have done on the internet or even industry and shit out of these girls attractive and you were attracted to them and you guys had consensual sex. Is that what you're saying? Just rape. What the fuck did that? Or as it's known now, Reagan, this guy, 88 percent of white wealth is duty, honor, and a privilege to get a t shirt on.

Speaker 3:          01:50:38       I hope that that's not really his shirt. I hope someone, he thinks he's a fucker and they, they photoshop that shit out a shirt. Maybe that's. Maybe that's fucking despicable it. Because first of all, what does that have to do with me at all? Like let's say if I earn something for 70 percent, I'm not in that. When you throw those numbers up, I want to see studies. I want to see 88 percent. What would that do? Very specific number Geno. See what do you not notice? The fucking shit that the white, white, young, white woman led fucking movement. The social jihadis, they're just fighting for the right to do white men what they've always done to black men, which is like, he scared me. I want him fired. Well, it's also, it's scrubbing all the meds, so congratulations. You get to be like an inward now.

Speaker 3:          01:51:22       Well, it's also toxic femininity where it's like the way a lot of women's instincts are based around keeping a toddler away from Mike light sockets, so it's like whatever they do, it's all good. It's not the field instinct to do that too as well. Hold on, keep going. Keep the father away from a life socket. All right. Like women are more designed in general to take care of very young children and men are more like seven onward where it's like if you fall down, you hurt yourself and you learn your lesson. Now get out there. Just the design that makes them do that. How do you mean ergonomically designed or how would they know emotionally wired to do that where it's like women. Once my wife first had a baby, I really was like, oh, this is like. Makes perfect sense. That's why they have bras.

Speaker 3:          01:52:06       You feed a baby, right? Exactly. Yeah. Well I don't think that's a. no, but that's what I mean though. It's kind of like a lot of the this sjw mentality is that safe space. Like if there's a group of people, there's nothing they could possibly have done wrong, but protect at all costs. Almost maternal. Exactly. Maternal. I mean like this is the thing that makes me laugh and that's the point I was making. You want to bother you want to mother society, but you, you killed your babies. Didn't yet have. You shouldn't. You don't have board us. They didn't kill their babies. Like you throw in the ones that got abortions in and they're all contaminants on the clergy. On the levy. Specifically the online feminist clergy, right? To have an abortion, you get in the club, you have to show you receipt card. Lena Dunham is the classic because I feel bad for her. It's like she's like, I just want to be good in my church. I'm the guy who worked for me didn't commit rape. Oh, I'm sorry he did this. Communism. This isn't harmless. The body's stack like the number one death of the 20th century was your own government. My own. Wait, wait, who you talking to me? Who's me? You people and us like human government is 60 million Russians, a 60 million Chinese and he got Hitler. He got like that. Are we in of so high? Are we in Russia? What do you mean by that?

Speaker 3:          01:53:29       When you say your own government inclusivity, all that stuff, it all leads to like the way to make a forest equal is with an ax. That's it. And the tallest nail gets hammered down like these are all and we're starting to enter like a upside down world and the left or the right wing tyranny is more sexy. That's why you hear about Hitler because he's an evil guy, but at least he had like great boots and shit. But like the styling is a bean counter. That's why he has way bigger death cap. We never hear about it because he's just like, let them starve. We thought stolen. I always would always read about Stalin was he was Kinda like a meathead and Lenin was the intellectual install, like the muscle that kind of crept up, but he was just like a fucking, you know, am I wrong in that?

Speaker 3:          01:54:12       That's what I know of. Lenin was a little bit of both. He was in. He was an ideologue. Did you read the Shit of classified when? Uh, uh, from Russia. That stuff's donald had them working on. No, he wanted to make these gorilla human hybrid soldiers. This is when they couldn't say no to Stalin like the later years where whatever he said, God, okay, Stalin. He goes, make gorilla soldiers that don't have to eat very much. And then they're like, well, gorilla is actually eat all day. It might not be, but don't let the soldiers that don't have man, half gorilla soldiers so that they wouldn't have to eat a lot. I mean, it's crazy. This shit. Well, if you stop clapping first he killed you and there's this one time where there's nine straight minutes of everyone clapping and like, because they knew the people knew that the first one is stop is going to die and someone finally passed out and they killed them yet because that's how far compliance goes.

Speaker 3:          01:55:00       It's just they keep getting you to comply, comply, comply. And that's, that's a question I want to know about guns and abortion. It's like what? Where's the line? Because if you can't determine it, someone's when like you were saying like when do you think it's okay or not okay to have an abortion? You wait is a good fucking one day before too. On both sides. There's an unreasonable argument on both sides. They're not willing to give it up at all. Right? On both sides. You know, it's funny man, because like I, like I said I don't care about all your kids. However, I don't get, I don't get aggressive opening statement but I don't get that. Having been said, I don't get why the only thing we can do is nothing. Like they're like, I'm very sorry. There's absolutely nothing that can help them. But if you're a gun, a gun lover or just

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       shoot her or know anything about guns and someone says air 15 and they don't realize that a 10 is the same gun except with bigger bullets or an sks or are that automatic guns are already illegal and they want to like band something they don't understand. Like there is no such thing as an assault rifle. That doesn't make any sense. You, you call it an assault rifle. You noise with your mouth. Who Cares? We'll do. The point is there's guns that didn't shoot a bunch of people really easy with. You have ar 50. They know what's going on. Is it guns killing people like all this other stuff is nonsense and people get lost up in the minutia of it. Like you know, they don't know the names. What's a bump stock do, do you think? Like I was in South Dakota not long ago and the dude I was hanging out with like a doomsday prepper. Right? He's a guy that worked at a club but he's like a nice guy. The same canned peaches.

Speaker 1:          01:56:38       So corny was like, don't call me that guy man bro. How many cans are gonna need? Thirty years worth. Shit doesn't go bad bro. Good pitches are good when they're fucking canned peaches. Like in someone's basement. How long has that shit last a while. Like years does it last year's. Yeah. They're designed for the apocalypse. There's like 50 shit. That's what they'll do. They can cause he was doing it. Not yet. I swear to God told me he's not. He's a Christian, but he's not a good Christian. Oh, so what do you do wrong? I didn't. I didn't pry, but he. He's not going. He's not going up in the first like pickup. Oh, he'll have to like the thing about the Christian says you could always even on the fucking buzzer on the Buzzer, except Jesus and you're not during. Not during the great tribulation that he was planning to live through which the stockpiles before it was going to have to live through that and then get caught up in the second pickup.

Speaker 1:          01:57:41       He won't be the disappearing out of his clothes guy. The problem with where both of us live, you and I is if the shit does hit the fan, we're kind of far, far too many people, too many people in Manhattan. Too many people in here. It ain't good. This is no Bueno. I did carry that with the winter but. But yeah, like a winter look, if you don't have laws you're going to go out and you could whack 30 fucking deer and stack those fuckers up in your garage. Like there's deer all over the place up there. You are going to have fresh water everywhere with your car and not even wanting to do well. They, some places they allow you to pick that deer up and take it home and eat it. Like after you hit it with your car they should for sure.

Speaker 1:          01:58:24       But the thing is that they were saying like, what if people are targeting the deer? Like, well what could you do? How much it costs the damage that a deer does your fucking car. Like they destroy your car. Thousands of dollars of damage. Who the fuck is going to do that? And that's a lot of driving for a deer that you could buy a tag for, for like 50 bucks and kill with like a knife, like deer in my yard. Literally just be eating my flowers and just look at me like bitch, you know, this is the village. And I'm like, dude, I lived in boulder when you are, when you get out, like in the town of Boulder, you'll see a fucking giant mule deer sitting on the side of the road eating big ass book, giant antlers just sitting there and you can get out of the car and go, motherfucker are you for real?

Speaker 1:          01:59:07       And this thing would just be looking at you just eating there. So convinced that no one's going to eat them. They just wander through the city. It's amazing. It's fucking amazing. I just, I was just in Denver, boulder is about our outside maybe less, maybe a little less than an hour. It's a cool little mountain community. Very, very quiet. I love it. To the best town. They just give you an egg a day. It was hilarious. I had not seen like a, the guy with like the oakleys on top of his fucking son. Like, like whoa. The homeless white kids with the dog and Shit I haven't seen in awhile. That is a juicy bag in Denver. No, outside was like the mountain I was in under the. So yeah, one of those around mountain, like a South Park town. Yeah, there's, that's where evergreen is.

Speaker 1:          01:59:52       Evergreen is where they grew up. Training that Parker grew up in evergreen. Evergreen is fucking amazing. It's amazing. Just like outside of Denver, like just outside evergreen has a population of elk that's 100 strong to walk through the middle of the fucking city. A buddy of mine lives there. My friend Brian called. We put a bunch of videos on his, uh, his uh, instagram is instagram is the gritty bowman or it might be gritty bowman. He's got a podcast called degrees. All of those things. Even like a, like a horse on the west banks or like a life worth, but like look like a fucking dinosaur to you if you've been in city long enough, you're like, I can't believe is a giant fucking animal looking at me. I mean, that's a look at that. That looks prehistoric. Yeah, those are elk. That's great. I don't know who that gentleman, his buddies that got one of those, but he's got some videos on his instagram somewhere of his town.

Speaker 1:          02:00:40       He lives in evergreen, I believe in, and these gigantic fucking deer just walking through his yard. Well, curious. It's on his facebook. It says his two loves or bowhunting and Barack Obama. What are the odds this horn size have to do with hammer size? Oh yeah, for sure. Like hammers on them. The bigger the elk, the bigger the antlers. The older. If they keep it, like she's trying to get rid of it. She is in her yard. They just wander into people's yards and that's a female, but that's probably a 300 pound animal and an animal. You know what, man? I'm A. I'm a little because I love shooting, but I'm. I'm like, I think that'd be a little queasy. I just don't want to clean my like that's what I want to. You get used to it. It's not even fishing. I never did. It's a different thing. That fishing. It's way more intimate. Yeah. Fishing, like I don't do any remoting into your blooded now. I don't feel any remorse when I kill a fish. Hey, weird. By the way, the Donner party die in Colorado. They were.

Speaker 3:          02:01:41       No, they were in. Why wasn't it the Sierra Nevadas? Is that what they done? Drove through there on the way back. He doesn't remember how long it was. Nevada. The Donner Party? Yeah. How long before you eat a guy? Me None. I mean no chance to look. What kind of fucking life is this going to be? Am I hold on, am I getting the story wrong? They got trapped in the snow. It had to eat each other, meet each other out. All winter. Each other's is isn't true. This is where father and son, mother and daughter eating each other, print it online and it'll be so. It was a tragedy at any correction of it will be ignored each other out for months. The entire winter months they just had our standing 69 constant just staring at each other. The Bush size back then to eat, throw. Oh Man. Huge.

Speaker 3:          02:02:33       It's chaos. There's some dicks. It wouldn't make it through that Bush. Yeah, probably a lot of them. Just like you can have a four or five, eight Bush. Especially like super measuring the butch, like I got a five inch. He's at beards, they have these long ass beards and the longer the beard, the more desirable that Turkey is. Balls on their nose. Is a beard on. No, no, no. Down here it grows like a write off of like their neck area, like where the kits, the chest. It's this long thing that gets called a Turkey beard. Yeah. They're like dinosaurs, cock and balls on. They got all that stuff, but I forget what that's called. It's all fucked up too. Yeah. What does that shit. The red stuff like gristle or when you see a rooster rooster's what did you call the fucking red thing?

Speaker 3:          02:03:24       Never know man. I have no idea what they call the red thing. I have no reason to know that. Yeah, put Turkeys will fuck you up too. Fuck you. They're aggressive in some places. I got to do a joke about that and it sounds like I have this personal issue with Turkeys when I play, because I saw a pbs thing about Turkeys. They will never be a friend. A Turkey. Did you see where the guy lived with Turkeys? No, he fucking. My life is a Turkey. If you can identify as a Turkey, is that what was going on? He was with them for when they hatch. They would follow him around the second they hit puberty. They turn into prehistoric dinosaur. Vicious fucking. They're gone. Except like lizards favorite. Stayed with them. Turkey boy. His favorite Turkey. Okay. Yeah. And then one day there by a log.

Speaker 3:          02:04:05       And this is what to me, if you should watch this as soon as possible. I hope I'm not remembering this wrong highlight, but I swear to God. So Turkey boy, one day just fucking turned on him and attack him and went for his eye. They go for your eyes. Favorite Turkey. Turkey boy. Who was like, I thought that was going to be an in Turkey. Boy wouldn't have no, he went for his eyes and a state show reenactment with uh, another like, it's like an after Turkey. I don't know how they did it was in the union because Turkey is just go for your fucking eyes. Yeah. You don't need a lot of training and they visit Turkey. But my joke is, because you know as a live Turkey is

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       a huge size of Kat Williams and it's like, and it's like, and his buddies probably didn't get very good. They probably weren't too compassionate when they're like, what? Why did he turn on me? Like I shouldn't trust the Turkey. And they're like, fucking Turkey, man. Well you think about a chicken. Chicken's a ruthless. And then now think about a Turkey. Turkey's are giant chickens when they haven't been bread and all the trees where my grandfather lived in Florida before he died, there was all these feral cats and chickens on their property and we feed them. He put this big feeder out. It was amazing how they formed a little society because it will be a kitten or cat, a chicken catcher. They didn't have any interaction. They just all came and ate the food. That's amazing. Yeah. I mean you're watching it. That's just crazy. And they were listening to the cast and kill the little chickens.

Speaker 1:          02:05:23       Not even at all. A little bit crazy. There's just plenty of food that's super rare that a feral cat can keep it together. I would have never thought that until I was watching them do it. It was adorable. You don't see the numbers. Disney movie. See the numbers of birds that feral cats killed in America every year. It's in the billions. Do we need them to do it? No. I probably, you know, when you think about it, we probably do because in Israel they're like rats. My, uh, my ex Israeli, she told me they're like cats or not. Same with Egypt. I lost a chicken to a coyote last night. I had to uh, finish the chicken off with my chickens. I had a, we had a coyote in the yard, caught it in the yard by the chickens were out. What do you walked up on the top of the chicken coop and jumped over and it chased a couple oven bit.

Speaker 1:          02:06:02       One of them was knock, some feathers loose, but one of them it actually got and killed. It's wild. There's coyotes here. Oh Dude, it's, it's a crazy thing to be around man. To watch that through New York too, by the way. Jump the wash. The thing jumped to the roof of this chicken coop, like it was nothing. I'm talking about a six foot jump and it's so elegant. It's kind of beautiful and watch the way they did it. It was a bummer that had killed a chicken and I had a scare it off and now we know that they're targeting the chickens because it's happened more than once. Last time it happened was like two years ago though. One of them keep coming back to all 10 wants to coyotes. A Fisher cat and a raccoon. I believe. So. You guys were chicken farmers. Is that understood?

Speaker 1:          02:06:39       You get an egg a day per hand? Yeah. No, not always, but close in the winter. Want to get all the exit one's price, bro. Dude, we could have 20 eggs right now if I cut this. Come on. Fuck this chicken. Yeah. I don't feel bad about killing chickens. It's like don't kill him. But uh, their pets to me, I don't eat them. That's the kind of smart aren't the roosters around. Like I got videos of them follow me around because I give him treats. So I walk around the backyard and it's like I'm the fucking Pied Piper of chickens. Like it's kind of hilarious. Do you have any of me carrying my daughter's bunny walk in and all these chicks are follow me. I'm like a mini beastmaster like away games. Tell how bad is how smell. Bravo channel you feed them. Especially when I give them these little worm treats. There's these dried mealworms. They fucking love these things. They go crazy for them so I can.

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       That's how I get them back into their chicken coop. They were pretty big chicken coop, but when they wanted or the yard and I want to get them back. I take their, their worms and shake them. Chow. They come running to me and then I give him a little treat every time so that they know that every time I shaky, shaky, shaky. It's time for a treat. And they all there so carnivorous. They, you've never seen as something attack worms with the kind of passion and vigor that the chicken suit?

Speaker 4:          02:07:59       No, I'd say I've seen it. It's terrifying. They'll eat chicken. You see? Um, uh, a shit. Oh, fighting roosters and I went to Hawaii by the way, roosters are way different than hence no, no rape the shit out of anybody. And they also just, I mean, they're fucking crazy about to say same thing. I'm like, Oh, you have a different point than me in Hawaii there had been a hurricane and like these people had chickens like that, that it got it. So on the street corners, it made me laugh. It would look like a pimp. It'd be like one rooster and then like a bunch of hens behind him and he would just go around the corner and he was a wild chasing Hawaii every quarter. Just see roosters. Wow. Wild chicken. But uh, I keep forgetting why you brought this up. Maybe because I've been in Hawaii. Yeah, well rapey roosters, bird the fight, right? Because you know, it's like when they go to rescue the fighting roosters, I didn't know they just killed them because that's all they want to do is fight. So they just fucking, if they bust one of those rings up, they just put the route, like just let him fucking fight. If that's what they're into, you know, it doesn't seem. They get them adopted or something. They just fucking place.

Speaker 2:          02:09:05       They were bred for it. There's championship bloodline's like there's a reason why these things do it. What does this say? If that's what Jesus did and I would say let them do it, but it's showing us wild chickens in Walmart in one of these fucking shopping cart return bar things and they're covered with chickens. This is crazy. Why he hadn't quite. That's nuts, man. There's wild chickens now. What's the word on killing those? Can you. If you want some chicken soup and you'll have a lot of money, are you allowed to just whack one of those? I hope so. Look, look at all of them. That's crazy. They don't have any predators. See, Hawaii is a really bananas place when it comes to wildlife

Speaker 4:          02:09:40       because they used to have these burdens called noni birds and they were. They were so docile people. The native just picked them up and crack. I mean like Dodo birds are like that when exchanges datum extinct because these birds had no fear. Right? That's interesting over there. But they didn't bring

Speaker 2:          02:09:56       predators for it, so they have like these wild pigs and just running around everywhere. They have to hunt them down.

Speaker 4:          02:10:01       Pigs are very. Because we're on pigs, like in South America, that was not, not just disease, but the case was brought pigs that fucked up the crops. The native fucks. Everything up. Pigs turn. You must watch all that pig shit. Right? They turned wild and get tusks. Inheriting what Jamie pulled up here,

Speaker 2:          02:10:20       last major contributor to the key chicken population is always a shocker even to people who have lived here all their lives. [inaudible] wild jungle fowl is protected under state law. Like all birds of Hawaii. The Moa is protected as an important of nature.

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       Oh God. That's a terrible idea because that means nothing's going to eat them. So if nothing's going to eat them, they don't have any predators. That means to get disease. Not. Yeah, you can have abortions up until 40 weeks out there too, but you can't touch the chickens if you have food for them. They're just going to keep breeding the. The real question is do you have food for them? Because if there's just a law of nature, if there's no predators, their population is going to match the food supply. Oh yeah. Was awesome. Did you go secret beach that no one's supposed to know about, but it's on every map. Not even gas stations do that. Oh, wait a minute. Which ones? No, I've never been to Hawaii. I've been to a waa. Waa. Who is Hawaii? Hawaii. Hawaii is where Lulu I went and did that in Nepali coast tour that, that uh, Marin told me that it, but he took a helicopter.

Speaker 3:          02:11:19       But I stand up in Hawaii. No, my cousin got married. She looks impossible to deny. It's really like a rich kid that like drops out. You threw it in Hawaii. Like, let's see, you're from here and you're some rich kid or like sort of Williamsburg or whatever. That's Hawaii because you got to be rich. The houses, I guess, uh, it's expensive because the upkeep, because the houses degrades. The white people live in. There are a lot of cultural appropriation. Yeah. South Park had a funny thing about it. But look, if you go there, you rent a house, don't go to a resort, but also like the natives and it is the only place I ever go wrong. I'm like, you know, I feel like a white guilt like Alaska. I was like, there's no way this was better before we got here. Why I felt like, Oh, I hope you didn't fuck this up.

Speaker 3:          02:12:03       You know, because it's, I mean, I couldn't believe it was. I found out later because drove a witness. Publications have like these paradise, you know, would you like to live in a place like this? And uh, I found out later they were based on in Hawaii where I went because I got there at night and so I didn't know what it looked like. And I woke up the morning and it looked like the shit that I was told after Armageddon, God will never. So I'm like, what? It looked like fucking jurassic park is crazy. Like these birds flying. And we were like on a cliff. It was crazy. Dude. It's so pretty. Our falls are a helicopter through it. It's fucking insanity. Tell you something. Five days is plenty. I was doing this. I'm like, listen, I have plans in life. Like if she was dead, it'll come live here.

Speaker 3:          02:12:45       There's no. But that's where you go if you like, I'm going to drop out of society. There's no technology. I used to live in key west playing piano for tips when I literally was like, I got. It was like the island is. No, you know, I'm like, if I don't even know this hotel California for me baby. Yeah, right. It's like 23 just playing piano for tips and it was just everything was going. So it was the same deal every day, ladies. No, no. Cigarette breath. I'm here to escape my life. Forty two years old. Still Kinda hot. It was too humid. It was a lot of movement. But that's true, right? Hangs in real good. You see a lot of really hot 50 year olds. That's true. Florida, I don't know why. Yeah, you got to moisturize moisture. Yeah. Cause dryness does fuck up your scamming you. It seemed different to like less house. Like where I live is so dry. Like I'm 21 years old right now. I made you can really fast. Why is it's one of those places where you're like, wow, how is this America? We flew five hours across the ocean to get here. This is America, right?

Speaker 3:          02:13:50       I think if you just. If I had lived there, it would eventually become a kind of beautiful hell am I only joy would be showing visitors around and crystal meth. What if. Which would if somebody offered you a residency at the four seasons in Maui and it was serious cash, what does that mean? Kurt Metzger doing standup every weekend? People come down there. I don't know. Let's do a three year contract. Kurt, what do you think? Three years. Okay. Yeah. You would do like basically what [inaudible] does some serious gender. You get three years for three years. I think that's more palatable than a job at snl.

Speaker 3:          02:14:27       Comedy's tough in Hawaii though because there's no pain. Dude. I said the same thing. In fact, I don't know if you know Russman, eve? No. Okay. He's a funny kind of way, but he. I know the name. I got myself on laid at this wedding. It was like my cousin who is about to get married, picture and put, but you the. They had a joke about dolphins blow hole. He goes, yeah. He goes, don't fuck. He goes, I'm guys, don't fuck them in that hole. But if you do, hold on, you got a 69 to this girl had her. I mean it was like, it was already touching my shoulder and shit. Well, and I said that at her hand, shot off it because I didn't know they have to worship dolphins is a god there. There is. It's like a. it's like it tells jokes.

Speaker 3:          02:15:14       Funny Joke. They came, they got mad, she got mad because it's like, it's like the ultimate. If you're a girl that makes her own jewelry, best could let you know with colorful seashells. So you've got these seashells, that aura gemstone. They're like these rainbow shells that they're the only show you can insure. Lloyd's of London, which island was young. Hawaii. But there I brought, I got my girl, my ex at the time I got brody some necklace. I mean, you know, I brought back all this coffee, you spend all this money, they're like, you come back and let this shit you can't wear in society. This is some fucking handbags. Like what the fuck is what? It's also, there's a terrible thing if you're trapped on an island with a bunch of lamers, like they could try to get you to be lame. Like if you've got a bunch of boring people and you're stuck thinking that show last bar. It's all about locals and the locals are cool, right? If you get lucky and get a bunch of cool locals, that must be awesome. But if your locals are all dip shits, you gotTa Fund, there's a bunch of local celebrities were like, usually it's a fat guy that could sing. He's

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       real cocky and like that's your Hawaiian guy, but it's like they know I'm going, guy comes in and does all these covers are like four non blondes. Like, Hey Jesus. I say, Hey, can I sing that? And I'm like, Hey, hey, good job man. I was like, okay. I like, you know, I'm just being nice to him that you're dumb cover act like, you know, this years ago I remember, Oh my God, it's coffee for guy's going to die at 50. You're pretty cocky if you're being really negative about this guy, they're all either in the most beautifully. The engineer's from premier atheists, right? Or 800 pounds with the Samoan, the engineer per this incredible. Because my inlaws are a great description of like the perfect body. No, just dudes are fucking like, because you know Joe was witnesses in women's do. It does very well in Ireland.

Speaker 4:          02:17:23       Places with Pacific islander, his job, his witnesses and Mormons do very well. That's why Brigham Young University has ways big Samoan and fucking backwards. Yeah. And they have big family, big families naturally. So it just lends itself to there, you know. And uh, that's my favorite call even though the one of the most preposterous ones in terms of like what their background origin story is. When you find out about Joseph Smith being 14 and 18, 20 and he writes about golden tablets that contained the last work of Jesus. And only you could read him because he had a seer stone. I like that because it's such a great be the first person to say this, but the only reason you're like, fuck that. It's because it's like two recently, well not a few years to it. No one could debate it. Well sword up, but a 14 year old. He was 14.

Speaker 4:          02:18:12       Oh, I didn't know that. When I think of Biggie and Tupac, I'm like, they like 23. They were kids. Well all 14 year olds are full of Shit. They're practicing what they can get away with. They make mistakes, but he's like high level full of Shit. Well he wasn't just high level full of Shit. He was probably like a compulsive liar. Probably pathological. And it was ultimately a con man. I mean that's what he became. He was the people usually you don't realize these comments like how did they do? It's like people are so complicit in that and there's people addicted to that bullshit being conned. And they will ben Franklin quote write about like quacks. Patients are the biggest liars or some shit like they. It's such a bizarre drug dealer situation. The con man and Connie, a lot of times there's this drug thereafter, and I know I know people like compulsively have to be conned or sold or leased with psychics and people who love psychics. They will convince themselves. They'll convince themselves that this person has some secret information about them and they were so dad. Mike Epps has a great job. Mike epps has never faded, underrated, or the silver suit. He's gone on and I haven't seen it. No, that's why the best hours. He's a funny dude. That dude that makes me actually. Yeah, it's one

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       of the. Say the name again,

Speaker 4:          02:19:29       like underrated. Never faded or some shit. He's in Detroit, but I'm like old ladies. I'm like, uh, uh. Let me pass the collection plate around too many times old ladies break breakout of catching the spirit like they're like, they already done. Sent that paid three times. Now that's bullshit. I got to see. I can't do it, but he was always talking about like, these are old ladies that go to church. I know that old lady, like if they go to church and they want to pay money to the Jesus man and, but even they know what this is a little bit, you know, the guy's not doing his end of conning them the right way. They. They're not completely helpless. They like, oh, this is a bullshit. They want that Marjoe that documentaries about that. That guy that Steve Martin made his a preacher, a leap of faith is based on that and the dude who doesn't believe in God and he's making his move based on Mick Jagger and he's like, they want them to hit note. He's getting resentful because they wanted to be a hack and he wants to try out new stuff and they don't know. That's how I took it. If you watch, it's very interesting. I'm fascinated by TV preachers.

Speaker 2:          02:20:32       Oh yeah, man. I think they're amazing. I mean, some of them are so blatantly ridiculous. Did you ever see the ones that were put together? The Jim Baker, who was the dude who made a bunch of ducks friend, makes a bunch of really funny videos with Jim Baker using all of that survival stuff. He had just had incredible edits of real moments with Jim Breaker talking about his survival food and like how you can use the buckets of survival food as like a bottom of a table. So you eat there and you lift it up and the survival food, that's where you store it is survival cit. That is, you have people sitting on it like it makes a good chair. You're sitting on a chair fill with survival sales video. This video, there's this guy put together. It's fucking hilarious because it's all like some of the most ridiculous things that he says spliced together because they kind of run out by. Um, yeah, because of Jessica Hahn.

Speaker 4:          02:21:27       Well, no, I know, but he goes, set up. It was a power grab. Maybe it's in the eyes of Tammy Faye. That documentary because they were, they were con artists that also got conned by that fucking guy who was from the faith coalition or something. It's a, I lived down south that will not live in Statesville, North Carolina at that time when he was big. That's not like this is south.

Speaker 2:          02:21:45       There's like a certain melody to get people to say like, yeah, like Farah Khan does it. Where is that going to America? America sucks. Basta. Yeah. Well I, I don't know how you're different now. Now he's all bald. What does that mean? Why does saying Boston? Italian, they speaking in tongues and Italian. He's got a bunch of videos on Jim Baker. He's got a ton of videos on him. I think he might homeboy my test, but he puts together these ridiculous edits of the Jim Baker show. Preparedness and survival. The. Here it is. This is like is

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       good. I love when rednecks adopt Hebrew shit. Like it's their shit. Oh yeah. I'm going to blow his chauffer now and like, like dude, my religion, we had all these words. We didn't know what to say. And then I dated a girl who spoke Hebrew and didn't understand how off all my pronunciations were of everything. Oh, that's hilarious. So you're was. Yours was straight from the Jehovah's Witnesses. I had a my book of Bible stories where guys reading the tape, so I pronounce these words. It just how Americans pronounce, you know, Bible words. The Shit's not free for us. It's for the people that likes to say who pronounces it. Right. I mean there's a lot of these words. Well, Hebrew though that they recreated it when the nation. Israel is kind of interesting. They had to re re. It was like a lost language that had to be rebuilt.

Speaker 3:          02:23:11       Rebuilt it from the ground up. Well, I guess not from the ground up. I don't know. They had to put it there, but it now it's a fluently spoken language and it was like dead for awhile. There's two different Hebrews, right? There's ancient Hebrew. It's different, right? I guess. Yeah. Ancient Hebrew with the letters are also a numbers. Numbers in ancient Hebrew were weird. Yeah. I don't think they use it anymore, but that's like the original Bible. I mean like how many people use ancient Hebrew teak cv can find a video. What ancient Hebrew sounds like? Well, my ex's parents are Hebrew scholars, so they went to that shit. I want to hear what it sounds like. Like keep. It sounds like phlegm noises. It all sounds like a weird fucking sad. There's an example of that, about that sound. It's just a, you know, but I mean think about it like Chinese.

Speaker 3:          02:23:56       It's a very specific sound. German, Italian. Have you been to China? I've never been to China, but Japan though. It's worth going. It's a lot like she sounds. Let me hear that Shit. Me, aerosmith, Macbeth. I will. That sounds like a little heme. Like wow. Little crazy. It looks like Lord of the Rings Elf. Elf language doesn't. Ancient languages like Sanskrit looks so crazy. Know like if this was like on a spaceship, you would think would like that. Look at that. If that was on a spaceship etched into the side of the spaceship, you'd be like, Holy Shit. It's a fucking alien language. I mean, I don't know what any of those things are. I don't know what one of those numbers is. I don't know what the fuck those words are. Those letters. That's an alien language. That's, to me almost more alien than a lot of Asian languages.

Speaker 3:          02:24:54       That looks crazy. Well, that's, that's a reason to kind of doubt that somebody translating it, right? It's just like, oh, you looked at that jibberish and you saw well, scholars, you know, the whole thing with that is that these ancient, ancient, ancient languages, like all these stories came from these ancient languages. Like if you go way, way, way back. Shit. So Mer, like the epic of Gilgamesh. There's all these Noah's Ark similarities. There's a lot of stuff and all these ancient stories, that's all probably points to some real shit that happened for sure. It along the way. Just like what you're talking about with social justice warriors and how they behave like it's a religion. There's like a natural compulsion for people to be on a group and have that group have a very clear ideology the way up to atheism if they want it because that's like almost a luxury I think.

Speaker 3:          02:25:43       Yeah, I think you're right. And I don't know how to just, uh, about thinking what I will say the DMT shape. Uh, I did get like more of a, Oh yeah, there's more than, oh, there's something else there and it's crazy because when know I read about that shit in high school. I read some more about that guy that, that is the big DMT guy. Terence Mckenna. Yeah, because I think he projects a lot of his own horseshit into it, but that stuff that Karen does or the agenda, just let me tell you when I, I never felt a thing that felt so much, like not making me hallucinate, but like he was taking away a hallucination and that is such, there's something so terrifying about that. But it also like, wow, that's great. Like you just, you feel like there has to be just based on the shit you would say.

Speaker 3:          02:26:31       Even if it's just shaking your head, you're like, why would that even be in my head? It's entirely possible that whatever the fuck consciousness is can pass from this stage into another stage. And the only reason why I would hesitate to say that's exactly what happens is because there's no proof one way or another, but it's the pineal gland. Shit is not proven. They don't know that dmt comes the cottonwood research foundation. They did a series of tests with rats and they proved that live rats have a dmt produced by the pineal gland. It doesn't necessarily mean that humans do too, but they're pretty sure they did. You like to know that your, your lungs producer and your liver produces it. That's a fact. Yeah. So your body's producing dmt 100 percent. Did you know that? Or did you like, uh, like those hp lovecraft kind of horror stories.

Speaker 3:          02:27:18       I love those. And there's a movie made out of one of them. It's all about his pineal gland. He's taking something, mixes pineal gland swelling up. Which one is that? Movies on stars. The guy from reanimator. It's not, it's not reanimator I'm feeling it now. I kind of remember what you're talking about. I'll tell you that creepy. The DNP has a creepy creepy because I was totally worth doing. But the thing that's, you know, whatever people say they meet entities, right? But I don't know if that shit is meeting entity, but I'll tell you the thing that just sticks with me that I'm like, how in the fuck is that possible is the shapes that you, that I could say I was well aware that they were a bit more than three dimensional shapes and it's so crazy to look at that and perceive it. And I'm like, how on earth could I perceive this shape? And when I came and you can't break, come back with it. Like, you know, you see it though. And someone's like, have you ever seen Alex grades aren't awesome? No. You haven't seen it. Pull up Alex Gray. He's a psychedelic artists. I mean all of this stuff is basically just to mean based art because sometimes. Oh No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          02:28:21       He's brilliant. His stuff's something. If it's fucking amazing for two, one of them, but let. Yeah, he draws a, the covers for tool albums. There's a ton of like that one. That one specific DMT DMT. That is dmt. That is hardcore dmt. Hardcore dmt. When you do Dmt, you see that and you see that in a way where it's so much more spectacular than any. Anything you ever seen. Normal consciousness is your body. They're like, are you saying you're not thinking of your. You're. You look around you. You're stupid. If you're opening your eyes. Here's what's crazy because you can sort. If you close your eyes, it's like they're open somewhere else and then you open your eyes. You see reality overlaid over to tell me this can influence the Egyptians. Click on the one your cursors on. Tell me that didn't influence the Egyptians. What? This painting or this, this, these kind of trips. Images. DMT. One hundred percent. Yeah. There was. One of the things that John Anthony West did was he was going over that temple in the temple and man is one of the structures.

Speaker 2:          02:29:26       It's in, in Egypt and it, it shows different parts of it are supposed to represent different corridors of the body, like different Chakras of the body and that there was some evidence that the eye of horus is really the pineal gland and that's what that. That symbol is like. See if Google, a pineal gland, eye of Horus, they think that they're. They're so similar in the way they're shaped. It's entirely possible that that's what. That's a very alternative thing, but look how it looks, how the thing looks on the right, the actual pineal gland, and look at the eye and the left. Well, yeah, see that wing off the side and the way it drops down right from the eyeball. Boy, that's fucking similar. It's entirely possible that they figured that out somewhere along the line that through yoga breathing methods or some sort of psychedelic drugs, they found that they were achieving a hallucinogenic state and they were able to somehow or another isolate where that state is being initiated and if it's being initiated in dodgy, honestly by your body, like through psychedelic breathing. That's probably where it's being produced.

Speaker 1:          02:30:36       Well, I don't want to sound like Schumer defender, but that look, coincidentally parallel thought certain patterns over and over again that, but that pattern is pretty fucking close. You might be right, it might be coincidental, but the fact that it dropped a straight line drops down right before the. I showed again, straight line drops down right below the eye and the left Egypt. That's the thing they did. They did surgery on people in Egypt, right? First of all, I thought Egypt thought the mind was in the heart and that's why they pulled the useless brain out through the nose. When they mummified you like you're telling me what their intent. You know what I mean? Like embalming techniques we have, but that doesn't mean that in respect to brain kept. No, they didn't look well. I'm looking at it. They didn't

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       know everything about the human body. The way they attach significance to something in the brain if they don't think that's what I think through psychedelic drugs. I think when they were doing these heavy psychedelic drugs, which by the way, we're absolutely being used by them by tons and tons. I could listen to the dude. This is the thing that really blew my mind because I was looking. You don't want to even believe rumors. That's what's going on. Again, I saw. I looked. You ever look at somebody while you're on trip? No, I've always kept my eyes closed. I closed my eyes and one time I opened my eyes and look at somebody and they had six arms, like a Hindu. Somebody was just saying, I might have been telling you this at the economy store told me at the time, perception gets broken down and that's the craziness.

Speaker 2:          02:32:03       And so then motion looks like sick. Like Shiva. It looked like a Hindu thing and I'm like, wow, I imagine beyond that stuff and you see something. I mean, it looked, it looked to me so much, like a vision from the intake. Those six rm Kinda got collect that kind of art like Buddhists and shit like that. Like this kind of shit because I saw this, I saw this image, this exact image. I mean this has a third eye and everything. The sculptor made this for me. I don't remember his name. Yeah. I wish I could remember right now, but I don't. Um, but yeah, sculptor made that for me based on this vision that I had high on dmt. I saw an infinite number of those really saw one hovering here and then in every direction out from him. There was an infinite number of those and they were all hovering and vibrating around me, so it's like a fractal.

Speaker 2:          02:32:49       Is there like fractals, 100 percent fact geometric? What do you think? What do you think having done it? Like what do you think like, uh, what do you think now with the empty after la? You know, I, I, I think I saw just a couple things, but I don't know how long ago they were talking about it with people, but you have, what's your opinion of it now as like a, you know, what you're seeing? Well, it could be anything. It definitely could be some sort of a, an insane hijacking of your sensory nervous system produces this spectacular psych duck effect that's so profound. The solution to Jane, a hallucinogenic effect that's so profound that it literally is like a transcendent experience and changes your life. It's totally popped out to me. It's totally possible that it's just a chemical thing. What's also, but that's also a salsa possibles, that life itself, that whatever the fuck life is and especially whatever the fuck intelligent life is not understood what consciousness is not understood and the this idea that things can only exist in this realm.

Speaker 2:          02:33:47       That's not proven. Also the fact that when those quantum physicists guys start breaking down the nature of reality and they come up with, I don't know how the fuck they do this, I'm just talking out my ass, but they come up with the idea that there's 11 dimensions. Right? And that they literally, I mean, and this is all changing and constantly evolving and moving and they're constantly adding to this. It is entirely possible that there's a bunch of other shit that's around us all the time. That's just not here and we have access to it. And when you do DMT womp, you go into that other place. It's entirely

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       settling dude. It's like, it's not like you're going, it's like the shit's here. Well, that's why you as a skeptic, it's very important to hear from you. Like a guy. Like, I'll tell you what, I'll. Because I drew a shitty diagram of it, his wife felt this is what it feels like. If you ever do it like this little point, let's say a little point is you. This is what I felt like and these these lines I drew. That's like space and you're this little point that could stabbed into space time and all this shit. This is all the shit that makes you like. It forms a point. It's like closing your eyes and looking at all of all of this shit is fucking cross section of your being. Everything being focused into making. If you could just reverse look at it. It feel like it's lessons. I always feel like it's lessons. I always feel right. It's time to go to school, sit down, sit down. Here's what's going on. The one of the last ones, more profound ones was a bunch of gestures that were all giving me the finger. Really. They were all circling around me like giving me the finger like who he named you. Twitter is going to teach you about twitter.

Speaker 1:          02:35:17       If you're tense. 60 residents all negatively gesture. Giving you the finger. Like how do you feel of yourself? Are you in constant defensive mode? And then when I sort of relaxed myself, they they started wagging their finger back and forth like, Yep, that's it. That's it. That's cool. Very, very strange that the, the, these things that you see but you can't define are constantly changing. So if you try to like say it looked like a gesture, it probably did for a few seconds for a few seconds that lived like a gesture and then it imploded and became stars and then it sucked in and became geometric patterns and it became neon colored worms that we're making love to each other and a giant infinite bundle of yarn. Like it becomes weirder and weirder shit all the time. It's hard to remember when you're done. It's almost impossible. Even me saying I kind of feel of having kind of a fellowship because I don't totally remember what I saw.

Speaker 1:          02:36:08       I remember what I remember to write down or remember what I repeated. So I'm like going back on like my repeated versions of what I saw, but I just, I remember like flashes of the intense profound nature of the experience, their emotions to it. Like I, when I came out of it the first time that this on New Year's, the first time I did it and I fucking, I guess I was like weeping, but when I came out of it because you just suddenly are awake and I had like, I was so out of it, it was like not. I went, I went from weeping like Oh hey, what's up? And it. Because I had been staring some crazy thing that we're like, look so beautiful to me. But. But it was that. It was like coming out of a dream. I guess almost that mechanic quote that I think what I'd be scared of is unearned wisdom. I think we kind of said something like, be, be, be wary of unearned wisdom where I don't know if I can handle looking at something that intense. I was really a low feeling state when I did it and I didn't give a fuck. So I wanted to do it. You pick up the slack, you know, that unearned wisdom thing. I think I know what he's saying and I think there's a real problem with people acting profound when they just learned something an hour ago saying I'm not a

Speaker 2:          02:37:18       qualified Sharman is a thing that people enjoy doing and it's like, like jizzing out their knowledge and a lot of that is on her knowledge. Like there's a lot of people that don't really have a full and including me, I've done it many times are so full of not having a full understanding of the topic at hand life. Jesus judges it out. But you look for sure you learned a lot about yourself when you do those experiences. I learned a lot about myself, learned a lot about how I interact with people. I saw negative thoughts like expressed as like this dark green and black twisted sort of pattern. And then when my thoughts went positive, it blossom like the most beautiful flowers you can imagine. It was crazy. It was a lesson in thinking toxic Lee. And then. And this is probably like 2008 ish, somewhere around the end that that was this particular experience that literally changed who I am, literally changed how I talked to people, literally change how I feel about people watching a negative thought being expresses his dark patterns and then the positive thought, just I just let it go.

Speaker 2:          02:38:27       Like, oh, I see, I see I'm doing it to myself. And then boom. And then he just relax and enjoy. This is so beautiful and because you're looking at something so beautiful, that feeling of seeing beauty makes it more beautiful and just getting more and like tears were rolling down my eyes and Mrs. Stunning, stunning experience. It's easier to do that now besides that. But I, I know what you mean. Like wish I could remember seeing it though. I remember it happened and I remember the dark green and black, but it's so. I remember so little of what I actually saw. It's a total recreation in my mind, which is a real problem with memory. So real problem with regular memory. Forget about something spectacularly unique and odd as a psychedelic experience, but just regular memory. I mean, I try to think of what I did yesterday.

Speaker 2:          02:39:09       I know what I. Did you ever get the information like the last time I did it, this is what really blew me away is because my girl was saying I was going. I won't forget by the way. I forgot immediately. It's like a joke joke. You have to write it down. I'm supposed to talk into a microphone, talk into a recorder like right away when you get out and then try to decipher that because usually I feel like I can't talk. As soon as you can know, which you to do is use the voice app on your phone and as soon as you can talk, hit record and just ramble. First of all, you're going to go, oh my God, I'm a fucking moron because it's going to stop. If you're sober, it's going to sound so stupid. Like I lost the inner journey and better like on the inside. On the outside you're just puking and projectile shitting. Shivering like an idiot. That's a metaphor for twitter. There shouldn't be a which will be on that shit, like not being on fucking social media the level. Because at one point I was, I remember I would read like salon.com to fucking be annoyed. I didn't notice it like you're doing it on purpose. I didn't even realize how much I was like,

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       uh, my leg. It's like a conflict addiction and it becomes like some weird Russia people get journal masochism no, it's just a fucking thing of. Especially if you have a mannequin kind of personalities,

Speaker 1:          02:40:27       it's why is why you to share. You share this, you, you've overcome this. He's in the grips of it. He's in the grips of doing battle everyday, puts on his fucking twitter. I can't believe the amount of energy spent on there, but I'm not saying don't pull that shit on twitter, but don't look who gives a shit what anybody says he has. You've, you've had issues with it. Like you and I talked about it. Were you like you would get in these twitter beefs and you won't be able to sleep cortisol. It's the same thing that addicts, he had a gambling is actually losing to die. Don't know. I can't. That's not a smart thing to do with your time. I can't see why that would be good for you. I know you think like you'd come come up with materials sometimes with battling that with people. It would show me how to like this. Like it could show you like use twitter to represent who you are. It's just fucking hard to represent who you are. It's hard in print. It's very to. Because my tone is so key with jokes. Yes, and most people don't. It's not like your car.

Speaker 4:          02:41:24       The writing jokes going on there. It's promote where I'm going to be made. People will fucking buy a ticket if they want to hear you. A little insight though. Angry. Do I keep living an idiot? I was coming strong. Come on. I thought I thought it was like I was working. I remember my ex would be like, well you fucking get on fucking facebook. I'm like, this is my job.

Speaker 1:          02:41:41       Okay. Oh Wow. Like in my head that's like productive and see. Sometimes I do write with it though, like I won't go through my twitter and just be like, okay,

Speaker 4:          02:41:50       it's not copyrighted, just so you know. And also, yeah. Also you're just giving people become accustomed. See all this insight, baseball shit they do with standup. Is making civilians like you've never heard that inside baseball? Like the insiders terms? No, I wasn't working on a pilot. They go, we need more inside baseball on like in like, like Pete Holmes, a show on HBO is about being a standup. So it's like an insider's, right? Like that's how it's put out there, which I'm against this showing the process shit everybody does and that's what I would do on. I looked at facebook almost like a dye, like I'm showing you. I'll go very clearly. Nine out of 10 of these will suck. Okay. Not Be worth reading it all and one in 10 will be funny maybe, but you're not paying me for this, so I'm just allowing you to see my process.

Speaker 4:          02:42:39       You know what I mean? I'm thinking like it's a diary, but you don't put your diary like Anne Frank even had to be dead for a diary to come out. You keep just have your shit up like that and I'm giving it away for free and then people are entitled to it and how these little shitheads a little entitled foodies. So you're like, how is this nothing writing about Dave Chappelle's our that. It's Ho hum because I was reading some dickhead rainbow back, Chappelle and I'm like, where do you get the balls? And it's because they're, they're being made to feel like an insider. The same as trump is like an every man fucking dipshit, you know Joe Joe bag of donuts.

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       Like dom called. That guy is a guy like me to talk to me. Finally. Everybody's about that. Now there are. They hate like an elite or an expert. Experts of what I do. People over there. We went on several times. Let's, let's bring it back to the people that are writing. So these people that are writing these things, a lot of them when they're in their twenties and we would all have done the same thing, the exact same thing when you're in your twenties. That's right. You thought just like that when you hold on when you were a writer and you, you know, if you were writing a blog for some sort of online publication and you decided to take an angle, you know, this Dave Chappelle specials, not that big a deal, and then just go run with that. You would probably do the exact fucking same thing.

Speaker 3:          02:43:55       There's a lot of people that do that. Well, no fathers review. Like I told you, I'm a sucker. So I would review it and say what I thought about the hour. So that's not what's done. And I know for a fact that's not how these people do. And if you've talked to them, they go, I got to say I don't like somebody because I liked the political reason. Uh, yeah, I know what you're saying. It's not. Nothing is based on funny. I mean, it was always like that, but now there's an added political element of not funny. Here's a whole la La land section of it. There's a whole section where up is down and right is left and whatever the fuck you say becomes doctrine. People like to make Dane Cook a punchline that I have half the people that would do that. I haven't. They haven't made me laugh even a little, as much as they can cook, so I'm wondering.

Speaker 3:          02:44:36       It's a free shot. It's like carrot top people will take a free shot at carrot top. I don't even see these fucking punk millennials now doing the work and built those props. Yeah, carrot top is a funny guy. He's funny. Like he's a good comic. Like you could go see a show. It's a silly funny show, but it has punchline sample. Think they literally just a new kind of comedy that doesn't have sort of punch set up. Punch line is not only good. It's postmodern building block of the universe. Everything is that. If we fix post modern comedy, well you know what it is. It's. We just aren't good at it. Right. That's the new way are press or like every of activist by the way will tell you they're a comedian, but here's the thing. Every single one, if they like that style and they go, it's like, it's like someone saying to a jazz guitarist, dude, you, you can't play for shit because you can't play like Hendrix.

Speaker 3:          02:45:27       Right. You know, but they don't want to go to do this and I understand that, but I understand because I don't appreciate music or whatever, how I should appreciate it. I totally get that, but I don't think I could just walk and play guitar. Well, it's just a different genre though, because the whole thing is, according to me, it's other lowercase igeneration like right out of apple products. Well, there's also an applied snobbishness were the people that are not doing the punchlines feel like what they're doing is somehow or another better than someone who does classic setup, punchline sort of joke writing. That's ridiculous. It's ridiculous because it's not better or worse and you know, you don't get Brownie points just because you're eclectic or just because. Because you didn't know your alternative shit was old Steve Martin bits. Well, Dennis Miller, that's where it gets really funny.

Speaker 3:          02:46:11       Like Dennis Miller, Dennis Miller was super alton a lot of ways he would be telling these set of punch punchlines about shit that you definitely didn't know what the fuck he was talking about and you would laugh anyway because you didn't want to be thought of as stupid. There was a bunch of people that laughed at Dennis Miller's jokes. They didn't have a fucking clue as to what he was saying. Mark Twain had cancer. Just Mark Twain wrote a whole book as a joke. Which book was that? I can't remember. I remember this. I remember it was like having everybody, uh, review it and stuff, like it was real and he was just laughing his ass off. I think if you write the book, it says a joke at that point. It sounds like you wrote a book. It's almost like you bang a guy's a joke. He wrote it as a satire and people took it as fact.

Speaker 3:          02:46:55       Postmodern comedy. I was one of my first jokes in colleges. I knock, knock. Who's there? Pineapple. Who are you to say what funny is? Oh God, because it's true. It's like a.in a, like a painting. It's like childhood. You listen, if you pay it to see me, you can determine if I did my job and not, you know, you have your take on it and people have their take on it. But like there's certain guys that, you know, they're just funny. Right. And you could, you could see someone saying, okay, like perfect example, setup punchline, Mitch Hedberg. If you say that's not funny, fuck you, you're lying. Just fuck you. Okay. Because he's clever. It's set up. It's weird. It's eight minutes for reasons outside of the. When people tell you someone who's funny and they say they own funny or vice versa, it's because they're judging for things that have nothing to do with the material or the funding.

Speaker 3:          02:47:48       Like I've heard people say like, oh don't like a guy that stands Julie had a fair. That's a fair critique, you know? Or. Sure. But that's the case with music too, right? Like you might not like Bob Dylan's voice. Like, oh, I don't want to hear it, and that's a legit concern. That's a legit concern. Can have their thing. I've got no issue with that. Comedy is not just what you're saying. It's how you're saying it's now. It sounds to people, but why destroy cities? What I was saying like if you don't like somebody's fucking coming into, that's fine, but they don't. People do that with bands though. There's groups out that need to destroy. They're like, but I can't trust for you to enjoy it because I don't know how, you know people want to take, but how is it different than shit and on people like nickelback don't shit on people like nickelback will.

Speaker 3:          02:48:31       You're a beautiful person but it's not real. That's kind of the same sense. Cool. It seems like we just decided this up a little bit. Feel like I just, I was pretending to enjoy the show. I'm like, are you bragging that you have that week of a person that you were just going with the crowd and like a thing you didn't enjoy too trying to hurt your feelings? And I think you know that as well as I do that. I'm just reading what. It's not so much you're arguing with a nonsense person. That's why I don't go on social media too. It's just as these arguments with people that aren't even fucking say to me. You don't even understand what I'm.

Speaker 2:          02:49:09       This is my point. I don't say I read the Shingo. Nothing like I save it for the Rogan show, but beautiful. That's the way to go. Great. I'd say bring it to the Rogan show. That's always a good move. I love it. I just listened. It's, you know, it's fun as long as you don't get too caught up in it. But the reality is if I had a friend who got into something online and uh, it went sideways and my advice was, okay, you know what happens when it goes sideways, right? So if there's a situation where you feel like it's going sideways and a bunch of people are gonna attack you for no reason, step away, just step away because if you engage you essentially trusting your emotional state to a bunch of people that have no concern for your wellbeing, like they want to attack you and hurt your feelings.

Speaker 2:          02:49:53       You're not going to like plead it down to like, well mildly upset with you. Now they have this idea and you are the target and you as a person who's in the public eye as a celebrity, you know this person is you. You are thought of as someone who already has some extra privilege. You're thought of as someone who's already already stealing something from the rest of us. You already get some easy free ride because of your talent or your notoriety or whatever the fuck it is. So they feel like there's extra licensed to fuck with you. Do that too. Where I feel like someone is so big and powerful, like I'm not talking to him,

Speaker 5:          02:50:28       ah, is

Speaker 2:          02:50:32       successful enough. In my mind I'm like, it's not even engaging with the person. It's like, I dunno, I want you to send all your tweets to me first before you tweet. Delay is the delay. You send them to me, I'll give you the thumbs up and thumbs down. No more tweeting. Just texts. Just saying shit to Barry crimmins directly for awhile. Oh, that's hilarious. Same thing what I'm saying from power of attorney over like only he has my password. Like I don't even know listening. We're friends. I don't want your password, but I do want you to send all your tweets to me for it. We should try that. That'd be so funny.

Speaker 2:          02:51:09       Let me tell you something about Barry, because Barry was responsible for the environment I came up in. I came up in Boston, Barry Crimmins, he created. He didn't create it. He set a tone. He said, uh, no hacks, good writing, no thieves. He set a tone and that tone was fucking rock solid. And they were all these big fucking men. Like Lenny Clarke is a big guy. Kevin Knox was a big guy. There were a manly men. They weren't like these neat, like nerdy type, skinny little comedians. They were fucking savages. They did coke and they were punching each other all the time. They never paid taxes. These fucking guys were animals and Barry crimmins started the whole thing off. He was so good and so smart and so well read and so aware of what's going on in the world. He set a tone for the entire and everyone's scared of him. I was terrified of him when that guy started reaching out to me and we became friends online. It was like way after I'd already been on television, everything. I was so happy. I like Barry crimmins

Speaker 3:          02:52:06       likes me. Oh yes. I think you're one of the good guys and I think you're a hero and he's telling me all this shit. To me it was like that was the dawn of comedy. He was the fucking main guy that started it off. Yeah. Do you have that with people? I felt that way when you wrote to me Matt. Oh, that's nice. Well, yeah, he was terrible. He was so smart and so he was so well versed in politics and what was going on, making dared not bring up Guatemala or Nicaragua around him. They don't talk about the conscious, the Sandinistas, and he was like the last progressive like bay. He was a left wing dude. Believe say there's no because America doesn't have that. We have just reactionaries and that is what America is. It's all reactionary. He was a masculine progressive, right man.

Speaker 3:          02:52:55       He was a masculine progressive, like an aggressive fuck you masculine progressive guy who was anti racist and anti sexual harassment, anti obviously anti-sex abuse because of what's happened to him to protect her. He would go on stage and he would ever like a fucking, like a professor's jacket on. He had reached into it and pull out a budweiser. Every time he had a budweiser in his pocket that was like half a shtick, drink American beer and he put that shit right on the counter. Like right in front of you. It was like half of what he did was he was this guy that was sick of all this fucking nonsense around him and you know, he had like this real clear intention of like this is what's going to be tolerated and this end his actors like that too. And you'd go to watch him.

Speaker 3:          02:53:39       You would literally like. He was so powerful that you would change like your politically. Yes, if you were in any way liked about him. Is that because I don't mind anybody's beliefs if they're like, well thought out if you have so much of a trend of terrain devoted to something and if it's disgusting to you, and I'm like, I should. Like when you said that privileged thing you're talking about like where people are taking it, acknowledging their privilege. Did anybody read. I'll go read your scriptures when you tell me about these ideas. So the privileged checklist. Have you ever read that? The Peggy Mcintosh privilege was. Who's Peggy Mcintosh? The one that kicked off this fucking amazing privilege concept of white privilege based on her ideas on male privilege. Oh yeah. The what it's called, the unpacking, the invisible, a white privileged knapsack. I love when they say unpacking, I can unpack that for you.

Speaker 3:          02:54:33       First of all, the first white privilege is you call it a knapsack. That's step one, but it's clearly just this rich college ladies privileges that she just saw white privilege unpacking the invisible backpack. Every fucking thing that when I used to go, please go, go and educate yourself. Look, hold on, hold on please. Through the work to bring materials from women's studies into the rest of the curriculum. I have often noticed men's unwillingness to grant that they are overprivileged even though they may grant that women are disadvantaged. It's almost like she hates women in a way. Well, this is a weird thing, like see, this is the thing is very important. This kind of person thinks that your rights are fucking privileges. Okay, so most of the list is going to be things that are your basic human right and that if, let's say you're not getting because you're not white, you should be getting that.

Speaker 3:          02:55:23       It's not that I shouldn't be able to move into a neighborhood I want. It's that you should be able to also, but they're framing it as, no, you have undue privilege needs to be taken away. Like these are my store. Did way of looking at an actual problem. The actual problem is real racism. The actual problem is real sexism, but instead of looking at that, look at the people that are lucky that they're not discriminated against. A real hauling them somehow or another somehow know perpetrators. Yeah. It's a real fat check way of looking at life everyday. It's just a real young, shitty young girl way to look at the world. As long as you're not happy. Well there's a great quote that socialist don't love the poor. They hate the rich. That's a good quote and it's also. It's also some people I'd be look buried to me was a sincere dude and I would listen to and he didn't have.

Speaker 3:          02:56:12       He would give you the shirt. That was the other thing of that scene as barry would not really have a lot of money because he be paying into the comics and he really was a guy who was generous, generous, generous guy. You know what? I mean legitimately generous with his, uh, his adoration, generous with the way promoted other comics the way generously help people but generous like, you know what he did for that scene on real. He made that scene. I mean everybody will admit that there was a lot of great comics back then. I mean, there. Steven Wright, of course, there was a lot of great guy, Don Gavin, who's one of the all time, my all time greatest. There was all these great guys that were in that area, but this guy had something special and he was by far the most well read out of all of them.

Speaker 3:          02:56:53       And I think like abused kids have two roads. You either want other people to hurt or you want to protect people. Yeah, I think you're right. And I think that sometimes early trauma can make you like just so protective of the week where you hate when someone takes advantage of vulnerability. Very high was just prince. He had principles. This is the thing. It's like somebody have a fucking principle. The Jamie Kilstein thing. I had people write, write and shit. This is like right around the time, like ceased all facebook ads because people are like, well, I guess you're happy Jamie. I'm like, why would I be happy? Do you think there's like, I wouldn't wish that shit on anybody fucking evil shit here to keep me from killing myself. Very. Clements, he had to talk me down. I was going to do the shit that I had coming out on me.

Speaker 3:          02:57:33       You can't even believe. Okay. And, and what? I'm not, I'm not fucking getting into all the particulars ever again with people that publicly. But if I say barely fucking saved my fucking life. He saved you with perspective. It gives you a better perspective. Yeah. I'm lucky I talked to him. I am because I was in a fucking bad dude. When you're ready to do it, it's like, no, this is my ignorance because I thought that you were brushing it off like nothing while I was freight. Dude, you can't even podcast about it. I heard you talking on a podcast will go away. I don't remember. Um, it was a long time ago, a long time to ways that I couldn't even believe. Okay. And he was becoming maddening and then it was becoming like, it's just crazy, dude. And uh, you know, I still can't get. I had to go through a book. Me, I'd be tickled to have an agent. I, I don't know where they went, but it was like I was off the fucking uh, you know, I just had no, nothing. I know work. I had a job lined up that supposed to get. I fucking couldn't.

Speaker 3:          02:58:34       I mean, uh, I would just like taking it to work for shy anyway because I like my job, but it was crazy. I couldn't believe the amount of shit for something. I don't think it's controversial, but it doesn't matter. Once it's a slow day and somebody picks up and grabbed it, I can't believe it's a soft target. Someone would bring amy into it. I can't believe that's why do you say that? That's ridiculous because for her, but I didn't know. There was no show show while the show was going on. You work for this show is done, but you hadn't announced. It wasn't stop, stop, but it just happened. Show just ended. So all that time before then you were writing for, you know, why they would connect you to her. It's crazy to think you don't. What I don't get is why that would be.

Speaker 3:          02:59:15       No, I get why these fucking social jihadis do it. I don't get why normal people validated ever normal people. It's outrageous to validate that people. What do you mean with the fucking. Anybody fucking uh, uh, can we. Yes. This needs to be addressed. Amy, will you please take the floor and address this adult man, that's not your child. I think they have to do that because she's thought of as a feminist and she's thought of as a powerful woman, a guy working for her. I mean, that's what the difference is because Jay was talking about, I was talking about to Jay because he's like, I never get any because we sell like I was in. Now I'm in the jurisdiction of them because um, because you were on these fucking people in this religion, but like they believe that's their, like you serve at our pleasure and they, and they get validated whenever someone and all these fucking dipshit liberals.

Speaker 3:          03:00:05       Okay, because I'm a liberal dude or I don't know if I'm like the last of a fucking whatever, but they all just pandered. They're like, well, it's for the best. Don't stumble. Your brother just, you're not sweating. Yeah. There's a lot of people that are liberals feel the exact same way. I don't feel like they're really liberals anymore because of the far left has taken over. Like this space of what you can and can't say to the point where you're like, really on the outs. I don't get how they don't see trump as their guy. Like at that part baffles me. Like how do you even like just the stench be just based on these small hands and pettiness and like, well I think it's hilarious that as president I didn't tell you not to body shame shit on the hands. It's one of the most ridiculous body shamings ever because they're not even that small.

Speaker 3:          03:00:50       I mean they're not like outrageously small hands, so like when they say it over and over again, just to fuck with them. Clearly body shaming. It's not like you're making fun of his hair. That's an obvious joke. Every. You can't ignore it, but the hands like you're really going after him if you're making fun of his hand. People, its location of course. That's the whole thing. That's all it is. The hypocrisy. But like if you see what like why scene? It's like all these people were his best pal. Oh yeah, he is God. And then he was like, am I supposed to fall for this puppet? I'm sorry, Punch beat Judy this time people crying. But like do you fall? You cry pro wrestling. This couldn't be more of. They don't care though. It's about power. That's the thing that I had. I had to figure out where it's like you can prove a contradiction and be like male strip just called them.

Speaker 3:          03:01:36       God don't you do that? You, you engage with people online like crazy. You go after people online and insult them like crazy. You just did it. We just started though. Do you feel like you want to or if someone blocks you? Yeah, if somebody blocks you on twitter, that's not an assault on you, but you just go for and have enough information, but think about what your saying people shouldn't do and then think about what you do and they very similar, right? You want to take his work or say he's a bad comic. You can't be above it and in it that's just bottom line. Can't be. Yeah, it's the same thing. Everybody is just fucking attacking everybody. Social War, cannibalism going on. There they are. They allowed to speak to me out like you can't look. They went after her fucking Bruno Mars cultural appropriation, Bruno Mars quotation appropriation because they're saying he's a cooperating black music.

Speaker 3:          03:02:33       He's half Filipino. That was one of the biggest on the going and be plainly know Bruno Mars. They're tagging Bruno Mars for cultural appropriation and a bunch of black artists are defending him. Like, what in the fuck? He's brown hair, Jesus Christ. The whole thing is so ridiculous. It's not like he's a brown guy getting that dude. It's a new thing. He's not brown enough. He's not dark enough. Not from Africa. Whatever the fuck it is. If you do, you can't be liberal enough. We're going to get to like one state where some gender fluid, transgender like half black Hermaphrodite, but they're not left handed, right handed privileged or the other guy brought in my head on race wars who was like very funny and get on the show and like hit the worst philosophy I heard on gnomes podcast. I saw me out of the seller's like some white male club and it's not the most diverse. You know, like if I had a riding in cars to comics, it would be very diverse because that's just who you hang out with. I think that dude just talks a lot. He says some shit that doesn't make any sense. He went after me and who the fuck was it? Something he was seeing? Very nice conversation. Totally out of context. We were talking about how many, um, when kids get molested, how many of those kids become molesters and we were trying to figure

Speaker 2:          03:03:58       out like that is a real thing that does happen. Also where you get ingrained somehow or another into a homosexual being aroused homosexual rights, what would you call it? A boner boyfriend know that people get like, it's not the same as what you're talking about. Like young people when young people are going through their development, if they get arrested, it is entirely possible or $300 but not even molested. If they just have a sexual experience with a guy, maybe if you can shape somebody's entire fucking shit gets printed out that he said a bunch of tweets about like us wondering like two straight guys wondering how many gay guys became gay because they got fucked when they were kids. Like, well that's not what we said, but that is a study and I saw it printed that I copy and pasted the url for an actual study on that.

Speaker 2:          03:04:53       Like how many times people are molested and they wind up becoming homosexual or becoming a molester themselves. Those are two real distinct possibilities when you completely disrupt a child's sexual cycle, who's saying it's bad or they're not making a judgment call a off of your desk. It's exactly because there's something that happens to people when they get sexually molested and most of it's really bad and hypersexuality is another one. People become very sexual. There's a lot of weird, so we weren't in any way saying that gay people are only gay because of that. I wonder is it all. It's been studied by scientists, the shit about that. It's just as good as name attached to get it, so that's why the seller thing, but I gladly would have. Mom makes me. It makes me more careful with what I say though and I think that's the good thing about it, so to leave it in the past had been way more careless with how I say thanks.

Speaker 2:          03:05:46       To think that it wouldn't be misconstrued, especially not weaponized. Well due to apologies are not to the people that hate you because they want you dead and there's no. It's for people that like you don't understand. That's what you apologized for. The people that are against you or they're not comedy fans are learning too, right? So through this whole dark journey that you went on with all this bullshit, you did learn that though. So it's very valuable. Yeah. No dues. Barry Barry is very helpful to me. I know. But you going through all this and coming out on the other side, the experience of doing it. Yeah, dude, uh, made a lot of things that I kinda was told earlier that never made sense to me. Make a lot of like, I remember last time we hung out Patrice Shit. He said to me that I didn't understand the magnitude of what he was saying to me until then how so like what kind of stuff. Just know what a devil businesses is and how easy you get fooled into the brass ring. It makes you a coward when they give you stuff to, to let you know that that's true. But here's the thing, I think that's less the case now. And this is my case, I think because of the Internet, I think comics essentially have created a network of each other. That's exactly right. Think of the network of race wars or skeptic tank or family. Our Joey Diaz is a church of what's happening now. We're all in a network together.

Speaker 4:          03:07:05       Dude, I, I learned a lot. The main thing is that because I only really got work in his business because of comics, there was not the

Speaker 2:          03:07:11       history now, which is really important, more so than ever. You can filter down thing, but the network is an organic network. Instead of someone owning you or having a contract with you, great. They're like, oh, it's fucking funny. Be like, go see him. Oh, Gertz hilarious. Go see him, you know, make us. And so then people listen to your podcast or to listen to your specialty of, Oh, this guy's fucking hilarious. And we've told them the truth so many times that they believe. And then the other thing about podcasts that I think is amazing and then just the Internet in general with comics today, is it everybody supportive of each other? When someone has a special coming out, I see other people tweeting, go check this out. Yeah, all the time was great about that. So it was Ari, but these people are, you know, nobody ever did that in the past.

Speaker 4:          03:07:58       I feel like if I like somebody, should I go out of my way to compliment

Speaker 2:          03:08:02       out there. It's like bitcoin. It's a decentralized currency now. A little bit. Yeah, it's a little bit. And there's less of this golden ring. So that golden ring is just fucking acting. Okay. That's what it is. And it was not acting. It's writing about acting. It's like reading the scripts about complaints or casting complaints. Not Stand up. Complaints. Not Our world, man. The problem is we fuck up. We go to that world. Our world is inappropriate. Shit said behind closed doors making each other laugh. I'm not a teacher. Terrible class. I'm not here to help the class. We're, we're in the green room doing mushrooms, smoking pot, drinking whiskey, and then we go on stage and talk crazy shit because this is our world. Our world is not the casting couch. Our world is nothing to do with auditions or this whole fucking acting like the way actors talk to each other and actor speak. That's not our world. Now. We're not doing it. We're not. This is, this is it. It's a different world. We're trying to come up with shit. That's funny so that people laugh because we liked that

Speaker 4:          03:09:02       because I believe the last thing is barry said to me because they wanted to take his special awful Louis site, which you wouldn't do because Barry's like a stand up dude. I wouldn't like go with the crowds. Trendy horseshit. Like He. He had principles, but he's like, I'm so sick of the untalented hijacking of very real trauma to a lot of people to further their dump Korea. He's dead on about that. It's people. It's like people. Because you know, by the way, the stats when they go one in five people are rapes. Okay. Or women are raped. I think that's probably just the amount of men that are raped and women could be double that. Okay. I think it's so prevalent, but just based on the people I know in my life. Okay. That's something happened to. It's weird for something not to what happen to you.

Speaker 2:          03:09:43       You see what Tim Dillon wrote about all this after the whole Louis thing. When Tim Dillon wrote a brilliant piece, I think he wrote it on facebook, but then he put it on instagram and broke it up into pages

Speaker 1:          03:09:54       so that you can keep turning through it, but he's explaining how this is an opportunity for truly mediocre talent to chop down someone who was head and shoulders far better than that and they do so by claiming the moral high ground by virtue signaling, by like going after him and attacking him, breaking down what he did. Or you can tell people's character by who wanted to get there. A little kick in. The same thing happen to me it was. I was, but you know, a lot of my friends are my friends, man. I'm lucky. Like I'm not. I lost respect for a lot of people during this whole thing and I'll tell you who they are as soon as we shut this fucking show down. It's already 3:19. Oh Shit. You Fuck? Yeah. Oh and Benjamin. As long as you promise. Leave Anthony Jeselnik alone. Son of a bitch get pluggy special.

Speaker 1:          03:10:39       A huge penis to Dotcom. It's called, how dare me. It pns like he plays the piano. Yes. All right. Sorry, go ahead. Oh, oh, it's my website. Huge pns to.com. The name of it is, um, uh, how dare me shot. And uh, in my town that I live in your gut, in our call, white, fresher than comedy central I made a while ago. People just now we've seen so far I haven't seen it. See it. I want to see it now. Where, uh, when did they film this? She was like fucking 2015 and it's on comedy central. Is it on Netflix or any of those places? It's on Netflix. It's a, it's probably pirated. Go pirate it. It's too, it's a CD. Like, dude, I just realize you're like the Doug Stanhope of upstate New York who do stand up in your town? I do. That's what Doug does.

Speaker 1:          03:11:23       That's a duck does down in Brisbane due to third of the whole booking Yakov. SMIRNOFF is his grandson. There's a big Doug Paul Bunyan, crazy checkered plaid. Arizona did one and three people came to the taping. Like that's a lot. That's an amazing story. I do because I moved here to la, so I'm doing race where? West Coast. Oh Shit. We just got to know you. Totally moved here. When did you totally move here? Don't tell anybody what you live for a few months ago. You still going to storm the fucking Improv main room. All right, that's it. Goodbye everybody. Thanks everybody came out this weekend. We had a great time. Bye.
