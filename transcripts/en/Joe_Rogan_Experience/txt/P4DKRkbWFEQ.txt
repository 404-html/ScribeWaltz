Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello

Speaker 2:          00:02          bitches. Yeah, Dad, dad. Dad is a real sweeping brush that people from both sides like to use, right? The people in the right, like do you use it on the liberals? The liberals like to use it on conservatives. We like to paint people like real obvious, put up, you know, put them in a box, make sure we can categorize them. Yeah. So mean.

Speaker 1:          00:20          I swear I said, I said, well, I think I got, I think I might have accidentally started a little bit of it because I said, look, all you have to realize is there's just a disenfranchised part of America that feels like they're not being represented. And then immediately I think Sarah got jumped on me and she was like, Oh, you're talking about the racist? And I was like, I don't know. You can't say that. You can't say that I voted. I'm not now, by the way, I voted for fucking Hillary. So I'm just seconding what ha what I'm noticing out of an election. So I, but I, you know, I, I thought it was good of her to stand her ground and to, and to whole end just say her point and not tried to back pedal and, and I, I appreciate that, but well, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:56          problem is the problem with that saying that anybody that voted for trump is a racist. The real, the real problem with that is because the only other alternative is Hillary and Hillary was very flawed. That's just the way it is. You know, it's not, it's not an anti woman thing to think that someone who has all the ties to corruption that she apparently does. I mean you can go into it all day long if you want to. Do you want to like look at the Clinton Foundation or any of the other crazy shit that those people are involved with? It's kind of legal, you know what I mean? It's not really breaking any laws. So like you can get away with doing all that stuff, but all of it is learned. Oh, deleted emails and all that. Like why did you doing like what is this?

Speaker 1:          01:34          Yeah. And I think, I think there was a large portion of America who just didn't want to share their opinion cause they didn't want to be called a name. So

Speaker 2:          01:43          there's real concerns too. And people don't want to say this. There's real concerns about her health. Really. She hurt her head in 2012 because she blacked out. She, she blacked out, fell, fainted, and hit her head really bad, like really bad. And um, apparently she was fucked up for like six months and this was 2012. That's only four years ago, man. And that's a really significant head trauma. And she was very eloquent and the debates, she's really articulate. I thought she kicked his ass and the debates, I honestly did. I thought she came off smoother, especially that second one. Like he would say some crazy shit and she would smile. I thought she handled it great and she was so much more eloquent and so much, uh, so much more so much better economy of words. The problem is, is just, it's so hard to, to trust that she's telling you the truth.

Speaker 2:          02:35          You know, there's just too many things that she's been like. The difference between that Komi Guy, what he said she had done with her email and what she said she had done and you play them back and forth. You ever seen the video when they do that, it's pretty shocking. You know what he says is very different than her descriptions of what he says. You know what he says is like she violated some laws and what most people thought in the, apparently in the FBI, it's one of the things that people got upset Komi apparently from this article I read at least they were saying that the people in the FBI were very disappointed because they thought that he should have pressed charges. They thought that when they looked at all the evidence and all the stuff that he talked about, that he admitted that she had done that you can't do it with classified data.

Speaker 2:          03:15          She had violated all these laws, like if you were a regular person, if you were real regular enlisted person and you violated those same amount of loss, dude, you'd be fucked. You would be fucked fill. They'll really puts you in a Goddamn cage. 100% looks like, I know this sounds silly, but she just like, they said, hey, we'd like to see her emails, and then she just got rid of them all. She deleted them all. She deleted 30,000 emails and she did it after a subpoena. At least some of them have to say, I didn't know it was after a subpoena to see how many find out how many emails she deleted after the subpoena. I don't know the absolute specifics of it, but it's just, it's my point is it wasn't like she was this awesome alternative, you know, so people that wanted change and they felt like what Hillary represented is a part of that big system as well as she says her words and is a stately, she is, and she's a much better representative of America in some ways than he is, but she's just too tied to corruption.

Speaker 2:          04:16          Like all of this stuff that she's done, like all the, the, the experience she has in government, all that should be on her favor in her favor. But for a lot of people it wasn't this time for a lot of people that would like, this government is just too intertwined with these businesses that support it and pay it money and they, they're going to all these different foreign countries and getting paid exorbitant sums of money to talk. It's like Bill Clinton was getting like a half a million dollars to fly to these countries that are all these like, like serious like civil rights violations on, on their people. Yeah. There was like some thing that Clinton had done. We kept trying to push this one through, see if he could find that there's this one like dictatorship that he wanted to go into it. He wanted to go and do speeches and they were like, no, you can't go there.

Speaker 2:          05:05          Like you're not supposed to visit that place. These, these people are doing things we don't look we don't agree with. And he's like, yeah, yeah, I gotta go over there and I'm going to do due to speech. So let's just try to get like, he just wanted to do that speech. He just wanted that Cheddar. That's, I think it's, what's interesting to me now is, is the, the population on twitter, at least of people, my friends that voted for hilary that are now just saying, fuck, fuck the rest of the country. Fuck, I'm out. This sucks. It's like, like, did you see that the Canadian website, the immigration website broke. It crashed. Brokes all the Americans were like, fuck this, I'm moving to Canada. Has anyone ever done that though? Fuck yeah. You think fuck yeah. Especially Vancouver. Oh yeah. Warm blankets like Seattle. It's basically just

Speaker 1:          05:58          like Seattle, seattle. But I mean like weather wise is pretty similar. Probably identical. But there was something different about, about Vancouver that Seattle doesn't have. What's that like a, I almost like this, um, like colonial, like richness, this European richness that, do you know that bridge driving into Vancouver was kind of big lions and yeah. And you're like, oh, this just looks like Lord of the Rings. He like, it looks like it could be in Germany and that everything's a little more lush or a little more overgrown. I don't know if Seattle, see I like sad. I'll love Seattle, but the downtown's look similar, but even still like the downtowns in Vancouver, the food's always seems just a little bit better than Seattle. Did you ever do? How? Man, that's a tough call. They're both pretty fucking awesome. You can't have shitty food and the Pacific northwest. Yeah. You know like Oregon, like Portland, Portland, and other places. They have some fucking bang banging food. Do you ever go to that? You ever do a go to that little taco trucks? The has? Yes. Do they have a

Speaker 2:          06:56          ty cheeseburger? It's a cheeseburger with that like satay sauce, that peanut butter sauce. Holy Shit, and it's super spicy. It's got Serratia and it to fucking love. God. Damn. It's good. Bill Clinton sought State Department. Okay. For paid speeches related to

Speaker 1:          07:14          North Korea and the Congo. He wanted Congo. He's an animal. They're cutting kids' hands off in the Congo. I respect his game. I respect his game. He's like, there's a lot of paper for me over there. I get to go get it. I guarantee you when he, when she got elected, he was like, fuck, I guess she'll be around my house a lot more. Look at this. It says

Speaker 2:          07:37          the FBI about the deleted emails between March 25th and March 31st three weeks after the subpoena. The campaign now says it only learned when the emails were deleted from the FBI report. Hmm. Wow. How many emails? Oh my God. 30,490 work related emails on December 5th, 2014 and chose not to keep 31,830 emails. She deemed personal.

Speaker 1:          08:10          Well, that's interesting. She, by the way, do you know how difficult that would be? I have 33 unopened emails. 33,000 on the open emails and my thing. And sometimes I try it, it's just like spam and I try to clean it out and it's a fucking nightmare. Yeah. It's not an easy to clean that out. Yeah. You're like select all, delete. But then you still the only taste where they're like 800 yeah. So if you've been paying attention to all these people's reactions, everyone's trying to like figure out why, why trump won. It's really fascinating. It's fascinating to see people freak out. It's fat. People at crying, people are fucking cry. Oh they stormed out of a school in Arizona. The kids marched out of a school to protest the president elect. Whoa, Whoa, this is, no,

Speaker 2:          08:56          but there is a weird, like there was a weird energy when trump gave his speech last night. It was almost like the bully saying stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself. Like he was like, he was like, now we can be like, it was kind of weird cause he has not been like super inclusive. And then all of a sudden he's like, we need to heal together. And you're like, hey, you totally feel that way. But like part of me goes out there. Is there a part of him that fucking hates everyone that doesn't like him? Yeah, for sure. Yeah. He certainly mean he's, look, he's a super businessman and super businessman there. They're like their game players that play in a game. So if you move towards them, you know, and you make a move, they want to make a move to county, you're moving fuck you up.

Speaker 2:          09:35          Like that's Donald Trump's personality. That's why he sues all those people that uh, you know, he's involved in altercations with. He just fucking squash this shit. He doesn't, he doesn't like, you know, if people are talking shit about him, but that's when once he become president, like you got to let all that go. Like you have to. Yeah, you got to let all that, you can't be tweeting johns to it at one 30 in the morning calling him a pussy. She watched that video. God, yet it's hilarious. He can't be tweeting johns to her at one 30 in the morning calling him a pussy when you're in your sixties. What the can't, he can't do that. Can't do that anymore. You definitely now, now that you're the president, please stop doing that.

Speaker 2:          10:12          Don't do it. You can think it, but don't do it. And even if you think it, why even bothering? What'd he care? They've got to get rid of his twitter immediately. Nope. He No. Please bleeding. He's get 'em keep tweeting. Who Cares? Why not? Oh Dude. Political correctness just took a missile to the Dick. Now, do you think, do you think that's good or bad per standup on unquestionably good. Unquestionably good in every way. Shape or form. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's good because he's going to do some goofy shit. He's going to say some ridiculous things a week. I mean it right now. If someone, if you said something like, I like to go up and grab them by the posies, everyone would be like, I, that has to be acceptable because half of America is not offended by that. You seat, I'm a believer in that.

Speaker 2:          10:59          The president in a lot of ways shapes the mindset of the country because it's just a natural thing that happens in tribes. You know? If you have one fierce tribal leader in a tribe, guarantee you the warriors that are in that tribe will also be fierce because they'll be under the guidance of the, the one wild fucking guy. I mean, that's how, I mean, that's how like fierce armies get put together. You have to have a bad ass fucking general. Well, when your president is this guy who rarely gets riled up about anything, he's not emotional at all. He's super articulate and really well spoken and he's a great orator. That's Barack Obama, right? I mean, that's what you would think of when you think of like a presidential person. He's probably the most presidential guy we've ever had as president. But then you go with trump, like he's not doing that at all. Like he's, he's just rocking it at a totally different way. 100% yeah. He's

Speaker 1:          11:54          doing it like a businessman. He fuck with him. He's gonna fuck with you back. You know, you fucking piece of shit. Jon Stewart, you pussy to it. It's real name is Lima was one 30 in the morning. But that's the kind of guy that can fucking finance campaign for president all on his own and when, yeah, that's crazy. A month. I mean, forget about whether you think it's a good thing for the country or bad thing for the country. It might be the greatest success story ever. It might be like the greatest upset of any contest ever. 100%. There's no bigger upset ever. Right. Like what do you think the odds were when Donald Trump first entered the race in Vegas? That he would eventually become president? What do you think the odds were? I remember watching, um, Seth Meyers State of the Union address and he said, Donald Trump's here, Donald Trump said he's voting as he's running as a Republican.

Speaker 1:          12:47          I thought he was running as a joke and I doubled over and I thought, I remember thinking to myself, what, what, what an idiot. Hilde, he could never be pres. I literally thought he could never be president. And then to think that that's a fucking reality. Yeah, it's interesting. Has any celebrity other than um, well Ronald Reagan, Ronald Reagan's one I was curious about because they said that, I don't remember the election, I was too young, but they were saying that despite the fact that he had already been governor, cause that was like kind of like he who he had been an office, they were shocked that anyone would vote for Reagan. They thought he was a fucking joke. And Dude, he destroyed Mondale. Like I look at those county by county polls where they show you what the counties voted. It's really fucking interesting cause you like, look at Ohio, it's all red, but Cleveland's blue and like Columbus is blue and Toledo's blue. And so, but the, but the thing is all the, just outside the city, everyone's voting for trump, but in the city, people are voting for the brewing Democrat. But you look at, if you look at Reagan's, it's the, I mean literally it's all fucking red.

Speaker 1:          14:07          Okay.
