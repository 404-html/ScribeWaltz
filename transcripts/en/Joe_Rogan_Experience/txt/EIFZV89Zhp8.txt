Speaker 1:          00:00:00       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       And we're live. Dave Rubin. What a time to be alive, Joe. I am so excited to be here because you could have selected anybody. I mean, it ends tomorrow. It does end tomorrow. Supposedly. Allegedly. Unless, uh, maybe Jill Stein wins. No, no, I'm talking about the world. I mean it is over. I don't mean the election. I mean the whole game is up tomorrow. You could have had anybody. You, you're a pretty powerful guy. Powerful Joe Ryan. Enjoy your company, sir. Well, I appreciate that. But you could think of all the philosophers you could had the thinkers, the artists, too much work. Instead, you went with me for the last show, so I'm going to bring it. I already, I have notes. I busted out the notepad. I believe that end of the world is tomorrow. So you're the preview to the end of the world. So I feel like you're going to offer some pr.

Speaker 2:          00:00:51       Well, hopefully. What together we're going to offer some perspective and a, we're going to get a look at this thing. Well, I already pounded two of these bad boys, so I am ready to this fucking thing of 270 milligrams of caffeine. Well, it sways in a small cans, so I thought it was all right. It seems like it seems small, but if it was that much acid and think about what we're doing to you, you really have to think about it that way. Yeah. I did acid once. Only one time. I did it once last week. That did. He really did. It was awesome. Yeah, I've done it three times. I only did it this year for the first time, but I've done it three times this year. Really? And you feel like all the doors, the hinges of the brain, there's still going because I don't think we're any good at all before.

Speaker 2:          00:01:29       I think I'm going, I'm out. It's like cock for my brain. Yeah. I shrew many times. You know, over the years I did acid once, did not like it at all. I, every time I closed my eyes and he's like three dimensional triangle is flying at me. Like could not, you know, when you just can't stop your brain. Like I felt that there was no end to it. Shrooms until he's like very natural and nice and pleasant. Yeah. The concern is the potency of, of acid. I hadn't heard it described by Terence Mckenna as like molecularly, if you looked at it in scale, it's something the size of an ant that can break down the empire state building in 30 minutes. That's a bit much for me at this point. You know what I mean? I, I turned 40 this year. I don't need to break down the empire state building or any other building at this point.

Speaker 2:          00:02:12       Now it's really about keeping the mental faculties I have adding in a little more occasionally going from there. Yeah. But you know what I mean? You have to function right? Like you have a show, you're doing comedy, all this stuff. Like at some point the expansion of the mind is like, I still gotta be on earth. You know, if you got to do the show, you definitely have to be there. You have to be there. But, um, Duncan and I did a show on acid. We did our last podcast with full disclosure. We were on acid cheeses. Yeah. I'm sitting in a room sober with these beans. Well, it's less is expected of me. I think you, you're expected to be rational. But being a standup comedian slash cage fighting commentator, you get a lot of wiggle room. Yeah. Yeah. You can, you could, you could say some pretty stupid shit.

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       People go. Yeah, that's right. Probably got hit in the head. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. So you know, obviously we're going to do election, but I, there's a couple updates so I haven't been here in about a year, a little more than a year. A couple of things I want to tell you first off. So I got a house last week not too far from here building a home studio. I'm very excited. Cool. Might, my fans are funding it, which is amazing. Oh, a ton of stuff has happened since last, but I told you last time that I would know that I've hit a certain level of success when I'm not sitting on an ikea couch and did not have ikea stuff around me everywhere. Now, I did bring all the Ikea stuff, but I made one purchase for the new house. Only one purchase. We've got a real couch. I got a real couch.

Speaker 2:          00:03:45       That's nice. I had a real couch. I mean, I'm talking people delivered it and I didn't have to put it together. It was act. Did you? I didn't even know that that was a thing that they come put together. Did you know that Kia stuff is bullshit. If you just charge 10 bucks more and put it together, everybody would probably cost more than 10 bucks. All right. Isn't that the whole thing? It costs more than 10 yeah. If for them to put it together for you, did they put it together for you? Will they do that? They will, but it's going to be more than 10 bucks. I don't even mind putting it together. It was just time for me not to have to put together furniture desks together once and it's, you know, I was like, I forgot it. If it had an estimate of how much time it took, but it took me four fucking hours. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:04:22       answer. Was this an acid situation? That would be something different. Shit. Ikea assembly on acid. I bet you do it better. You know like talk Willis, the guy who pitched a no hitter, he was fucked up all day. He was doing acid and then you got the call and didn't know he's supposed to play that day. And it's like, oh no, they want me to play today. He like got his shit together for good. Just pitching. Just imagine getting your shit together. Getting there. Just that in and of itself. Well it depends on the guests, your biological makeup, how it hits you, you know, cause I know a lot of friends who just can't smoke pot. They just, it just doesn't work with them. And with me it works great. It's my favorite. What do you like indicators? Sativa or hybrid? I'm prefer sativa, but if someone's passed around the end to good joint, I don't say no.

Speaker 2:          00:05:08       See, all my comic friends like Sativa, I like Endeca because for me at this point, and I guess this goes back to the doors and the main thing, like I don't want to think anymore if I'm smoking, I don't smoke pot to think or to write or anything. I smoke pot because it's 1130 at night and I'm going to take one puff and watch Seinfeld that I've seen 3000 times already or simpsons that I've seen three and that's it. You know what I mean? Like I don't need, I don't smoke to like, like all my concrete smoking, right. Or that. And I'm like, no. So it's a decompressing. Yeah. Agent purely. Purely. Yeah. Well, you know, people get real wary when you started talking about pot or acid or even alcohol because there's a lot of people that everyone knows that it's kind of fucked her life up doing that.

Speaker 2:          00:05:50       But 35,000 people died driving every year. It doesn't stop us from driving, you know? I mean, and obviously if you're doing acid, most likely you're not going to kill somebody else. So it's the responsibility of driving out of a window like a Helen Hunt did that. Did you ever see that inform word, that kid's thing? They showed it at my high school. They showed it in high school. How? When I was growing up, I think it was helen, how you know which one I'm talking about. What they should know. That education will video where they showed these high school kids and it's Helen Hunt. It was like a 15 year old and she's on acid and she jumped out a window and breaks the window. It just kills herself at school. Fucking old Bill Hicks bit. Remember that Bill Hicks, bit young man on acid thought he could fly, jumps off the building.

Speaker 2:          00:06:30       What a tragedy goes. What a Dick. He thought he could fly. What did he tried taking off from the ground first and as we lost a moron, man, we need a hex. Don't we need a hicks? Every day I wake up and I go, man, I wish we had is still, because we still, you know, obviously there's plenty of good comics out there and there's so much, there's such a plane, this stuff to, I don't need to see Helen Hunt to talk about. Um, you know how many times that it's been said before, Hey, a lot. That's the best Paul Riser. It's not his business card. I think he wakes up in the middle. I like, what the hell was I talking about? Acid? No. People dying. No, we moved on all the good comics. There was something there. Oh, well one that, just imagine what George Carlin would be going through if he lived right now, the politically correct age we live in.

Speaker 2:          00:07:21       If you took any of his old stuff, he would be being attacked by all sides. But dare I say he'd be hacked more by the left these days for the shit that he would be talking and saying about women or about minorities or anything. You know, it's so, it's such a shame the way things have turned. Well, yeah, he had some mean stuff that I think like, I remember this one bit that he had that even at the time I was like, whoa. It was like anorexia and he's like, dumb, rich doesn't want Tucker, but we need that now. That's the point. You know what I mean? It's not, he wasn't saying this specific girl who may have anorexia that you're going to a lot or died from anorexia and you heard that you'd be like, whoa man, you would, you would, that would upset you at that moment.

Speaker 2:          00:08:02       And then you know what life goes on. You know George Carlin, there was one issue with Carlin and that one issue was that he had a plan to do a whole new hour every year. And so he would put together this hour and he didn't work out at comedy clubs either. He would just sort of write it and then go and perform it and you know, do little tweaks here and there, but that doing that one hour every year, like you don't have enough time to like, you can't sit around and go, hmm, I wonder if this is a good bit, you know, I want to, am I committed to this? Cause I believe in it. Like if I explored all the possibilities and all the ways that this is going to be interpreted, is this the most effective way to convey that idea? But he was also so, so loved and so awesome that he just wanted to shock the shit out of people.

Speaker 2:          00:08:53       That was half of it was like he tired of all this. Talk about Anorexia and you know, maybe if he was alive today and you were talking to him about it, he would, he would change his opinion on that bit. Yeah. Look, I'm sure if we went back in the however many years you've been doing standup there things that you've said there probably that's probably not, as you said last week. Yeah. But, but we need that idea of people just saying shit and letting it upset people and other people are going to laugh at it. We so desperately need it now because it has led the inability to do that these days has led to everything that's happening in our country right now. What related to politics and media and everything. You're right, there's a blow back, right? If you go too far left though, the alt right emerges and I think the more looney we get in terms of like gender pronouns and that there's 58 now it's 58 gender pronouns.

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       Yeah. I didn't have to, you know this morning I think the only recognize 31 in New York that you could be sued. $250,000 for it. Or you find if you pull it up, it's fucking fiasco. It's wonderful. It's one going to look back at this and laugh as long as you're not one of the person who gets fined $250,000 and I don't think anybody's ever been hit with that yet. I think that's more more like horse shit. But it's not even, it's not even about the fine as much as what it does to us as people. Then it puts the idea in your mind, look, if I was walking down the street and I saw a guy and I said, hey, how you doing man? And then I realized it was a woman, I would kind of feel bad. But that's life. That's life. We're trying to through words and trickery.

Speaker 2:          00:10:30       And now legal means we're trying to dumb everyone down to the point that we can't even think for ourselves. If you look at somebody and you think they're a man and you say, dude, that's not evil. Right? You know what I mean? And, and not every person that transitions transitions perfectly and someone might be in the middle of it or whatever and you know, or there might just be a guy who looks like there's, there's guys that look like women and there's women that look like guys. You know what's ironic about this is it's not really a trans issue. Cause you know, talk to trans people. Most women who transition to men want to be called men. And most men who transition to women want to be called women. Like they're there. They assumed gender pronouns. Like the guy who becomes a woman wants to use he or once you, she or her.

Speaker 2:          00:11:13       Right? So it's not them. It's just nonsense is what it is and it's nonsense that comes out of universities. It's this weird Marxism thing that's going on. It's this very strange leftist bullying because it's so deranged. I went to, I know you've had my on here and he's become like this cultural thing. It's like he's, he's sort of become something beyond himself at this point. What's the streisand effect that keeps silencing him and when you silence the guy who, first of all, what they silenced him for was so unwarranted because when you, when you remove someone on twitter for just a harmless joke that's very similar to the jokes that Leslie Jones makes about her own self. You know, she's got a

Speaker 3:          00:11:53       God damn commercial. Yeah. She pulls up a Geico commercial, I think it is. Well, what does that, what does that commercial was? She pulls up to someone. I don't know who it is, what it is, but she pulls up to a guy, she's like, do you want my number? You guys who get the fuck out of here? It's like an obvious joke about her being unattractive. She's perpetrating that joke. That is what it is. I mean, if that's, say if you do that same joke with, you know, fill in the blank. What's a girl for Sofia Vergara or something like that. The joke doesn't work. It's just hot as fuck. And then the guy would be like, but when Leslie Jones does it, the reason why that joke works is because they're implying that she's not attractive. So all Milo said is something about her being a man or looking like a man or something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:12:31       And that was enough. Well, what's particularly interesting about what happened to him is that they claimed, I think when, when twitter finally said a little something about it, that it was because if targeted harassment that Milo had unleashed his followers on her. Now first off, you're not. You don't control all your followers. You know what I mean? If you got into a fight with somebody, Joe Rogan got into a fight with somebody on twitter, uh, you can't control what your followers do. And so that's number one. Number two, she, she had done that before. There are instances, people had screen captured things where she had gotten into fights with trollie type people, not public people and said, guys, get them. So she had actually instigated mobs. But it's okay for all the politically correct reasons, it's okay when she does it well not only she had, she'd done that, she had said things about white people specifically like white people, you know, and it was specifically mocking white people are saying things about white people where it's like you can't do that the other way.

Speaker 3:          00:13:24       The, you know, there's this also this very bizarre thing that people keep saying is that black people can't be racist against white people because racism only works when someone's in a position of power. Guess fucking what? If you have millions of followers and you're super famous and you say things about, you know, any white person, you have a position of power. Not only does she have a position of power, but she think how much by doing, by that fight happening, she got more powerful her, her star rose. Yeah. So by damaging free speech, whether you like my lower, not she, she then elevated her own status. I actually, I've never interacted with her. I've never even seen ghostbusters. I don't, I don't even watch this. And now I don't even know what she's really done or anything better. But when the whole thing was going down, I went to tweet at her to say, come on my show.

Speaker 3:          00:14:09       I'd be, I, I like Milo buttom all that free speech. I'd love to have you on. She has me blocked. She blowouts. I Dunno. It's like a mass block thing. Maybe you block people associated with Milo or something. But the point is, I have nothing. I have nothing against her in any way. We're just talking about this specific thing and I was going to invite her on my show and it's like, well, well you're a nice guy. That's so cowardly. It's so foolish. I, and I like Leslie. I think she's funny as hell. I think she's hilarious. I even enjoyed her and ghostbusters I'll, although Milo is correct, most of that movie, it was a piece of shit. Yeah. I thought the movie started out really funny, but what he was saying was that it was like, it was a ridiculous feminist version of ghostbusters where all the men are complete buffoons and failures and all the women saved the day. And it just wasn't a good movie.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       It wasn't well designed and it was sort of a kind of a slap in the face to men. And that was his whole commentary on it. It was very eloquently written. Maybe a little bit bitchy, but that's his whole thing. Yeah, it wasn't, it certainly wasn't targeted harassment. It was a review of art will look, the point is that even if he had been harassing her and said, guys, get her first off, but if he did do that, I can understand them saying we don't want our platform use for that. Sure. So that's up to their terms of service. So I'm not, so there's obviously a difference between, of course, the First Amendment, which is the government stopping you from speaking of what a private company can do. Ironically though all these people on the left that we're thrilled or had no problem with Milo being banned, they're the same people that want it to force that Baker in Indiana to bake the cake for the gay wedding.

Speaker 2:          00:15:35       So they're okay with private companies doing things when it's the things that they want them to do, like get rid of, uh, a conservative, right when they want it to force that bay. I'm gay, married, right? So I wouldn't force that Baker to do it. Why? You know, what's fucked up about, why would I want the government? Why would I want the government to say, you have to do something with your private business. No, I'll go to another fucking baker. Of course. And not only that, that's, that wasn't an organic situation. They'd set that up. They went specifically and targeted bakers to try to make a case for this. Right. And then you went to a Christian Baker and finally found one who said no, and that was the one they went after. You know, I mean, look, I don't agree with that guy and not being able to make that cake.

Speaker 2:          00:16:14       I feel like you shouldn't go and do business at that guy's place. And that's the kind of person he is. But what they're doing is, I like trying to target that guy. But would you for, would you want the government forced him to do well? I would think, I think the market should dictate whether or not someone does. I mean, I think alerting people is a good thing, but having the government dictate to these people have to make that case. That's kind of, that's kind of crazy. So that's the, that's what's happened to the left. Basically. The left has gone from liberalism using logic and thinking and uh, an information basically to make decisions to inform your decisions. And usually liberals err on the side of the other. So in this case they're trying to, they think they're protecting the gaze so that, right. Like we want days to get cakes where everyone else gets cake.

Speaker 2:          00:16:59       So we're going to help the gays. But what they've done is all they're doing is expanding state power. They're extending, expanding control. Let the market decide. Sure you want to, you want to use your free speech, protest outside, tweet about it. It's, they don't go there. There's a baker to two blocks over goes, especially if you're gay, you know, use your, use your money wisely. Support people that support your community. Of course, that's a, but that's a thing for everything. That's for rude people. That's for, you know, for assholes, for people who are Shitty to you. For people who are, you know, it's just for people who will rip you off. I mean, it's kind of along the same lines. Let the market decide, let the market decide. Of course, if you don't like Joe Show, you don't like Reuben's show. You don't watch, don't watch. Tell people that you don't like it. And that's quite all right, but, but don't try to shut us down. Don't try to go to youtube and strike us or whatever other thing there is. But that's what the left

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       is doing this now. And that's why I talk about the left all the time because I have liberal and I'm watching my guys band speakers, I'm watching my guys d platform people. I'm watching, my guys tried to close restaurants and it's like you're now you're moralizing the same way you've mocked the Christian, right. For All these years. Yeah. It's, it's just, it gets to a point where you, you wonder if it's to swing back the other way. I've been saying for a while, we'll find out tomorrow. Yeah. Right. And that creates tomorrow. I've been saying for a while that I think Caitlyn Jenner created Donald Trump. Not really, but it created this thing. I mean, I think there was a thing, there was a tipping point. And for me it was when they gave her woman of the year and Glamour magazine and then Espn has gave her ass a athlete of the year.

Speaker 3:          00:18:34       And when we're that ridiculous thing that they did where they circled or House with the helicopter and she was hiding behind the curtains and there was all mysterious, like, what in the fuck are you selling? What is this? And for people at home that are like in Indiana and they're drinking beer and they like football and they went to watch the sps to see, you know, like who won best quarterback in the year? And they're seeing that kind of shit. They're like, what the fuck is as we need a make America great again. You know, I never linked it that specifically, but I think you're totally right. Even right now, when I've been watching, you know, nba season just started and I love basketball. Every time I turn on TNT now it's Barkley and Kenny Smith and Shaq and Ernie Johnson talking about race. They're not talking about basketball, they're talking about race.

Speaker 3:          00:19:14       They're talking about policing. Those are all important issues to talk about. But people go to sports for the release, they go to sports because they care about that leads and what's happening on the field and in the, in the boxing match or whatever it is. And now everything is becoming politicized. So espn is giving their athlete of the year to Caitlyn Jenner. It makes no freaking sense. Well that was the NFL ratings down. You know, it's because people are talking about Kaepernick and politics instead of sports. Does that make the ratings go down? Really is the ratings down. The ratings are hugely down in the NFL this year. And a lot of people are linking that. I don't know it empirically, I wouldn't be shocked. There's a lot of people in this country just have zero tolerance. I mean, it's almost like separation of church and state. They would like their sports to just be sports and about sports.

Speaker 3:          00:19:57       Yeah. You know, and I, I kind of appreciate that in a certain way because it's like if you were watching a comedy show and all of a sudden during that comedy show they started deeply discussing religion, like really like discussing deep intricacies of different faith based cultures. You'd be like, what the fuck am I want? This is not comedy. Right. Do is funny. Sure. But once you heard that thing and now you're doing something else right, you're doing a different thing but you're not doing sports. You're doing, you're doing race relations. Are you doing? But I don't understand that. It's also, they look at it as a platform for our culture and that's what Kaepernick did. He said, look, I have this platform. And in some ways I think what he did kind of worked because a lot of kids in high school now are doing that. They're taking knees and the national, you know, when they do the national anthem, it's, it's strange, but it's also like the black, uh, when people have the black fist at

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       the Olympics, when those dudes that did that and the 1960, seventies, I think it was 71, [inaudible] 71, something like that, whatever that was. I mean, that got people talk and this gets people talking to, and maybe sometimes you need to kind of inject some sort of something to think about during sporting events. I'm not, again, I'm not telling them not to do it. Of course I would knit cabernet and wants to do that. Go ahead. These guys, if Barkley and all they want it, if they're tnt bosses are okay with it may go, well, you know, you can do that. Instead of talking about how many points to ran head then, so be it. But I'm just saying what I think most people want from sports is an escape. And I can tell you for sure in the two or three weeks at the NBA season, it's been gone.

Speaker 2:          00:21:26       Every time I flipped by TNT and they're doing that, I change it where I used to. I love those guys. I think that show in many ways is an incredible social experiment, not just as a sports. I don't know what the show is. You know, it's the after show on TNT where they'll watch Barkley. So it's Barkley who's obviously completely outspoken and an incredible, and Kenny Smith who also is in shack, uh, and, and Ernie Johnson's the token white guy in the white guys, but they're all really great and their, their rhythm with each other for four guys to sit there and do it. They've been doing it for probably 15 years. Shacks newer to it. But anyway, uh, I go to espn or tnt for sports and you want to hear, and there's so many to talk about in sports. It's all these players. All these plays, all these games, so much is riding on each event.

Speaker 2:          00:22:14       Yeah. So I'm not a grudging them any of the legitimate things that you're talking about. Of course they, the athletes can do whatever they want to express themselves in any way. But once that starts becoming more of what you're talking about, then the sports, that's why people start tuning out. Well again, the market's decided right and if their ratings go down because of this, I guess maybe someone in the head office will go, hey guys, what the fuck? Right. You know, and that's how it should be. I mean that's absolutely how it should be. Yeah, it's, it's a fascinating time and I think this is a side effect of everyone having a voice. Cause we all have voices now. You know what I mean? This is the new world we live in. The new world we live in is anyone can broadcast, anyone can get on periscope and just start talking.

Speaker 2:          00:22:55       Anybody don't tell everybody that anyone can. Anyone can get on twitter and just make a post about something. I mean, I've been telling my people, I'm the only one that can do it. You remember that woman? What was her name again? The woman who wrote the post about aids on twitter. I'm going to Africa. Hope I don't get aids. Lol. Just kidding. I'm white. Yeah. She was just a nobody pr person. Nobody knew who she was before that. I can't remember her name. Justine Sacco, right? Yeah. I think that's it. Yeah, but that, that sort of event it was, it's like that's the beginning. It's the first pop of the colonel when you start making popcorn and you hear that first pop, pop, pop, pop, pop up, blah blah, blah. We're culturally about to fucking Jiffy pop the fuck out of this thing. That's what's happening. You're going nuts. You know? I remember when that sacco thing happened and so basically she said that she said that joke, she gets on a plane, she disappears for what,

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       eight 10 hours or something and then she gets up late. Her life is destroyed. She has to leave her job, blah blah, blah. She's publicly humiliated. I remember and look, I tweet all the time. I love twitter and I love the way you can communicate through it. But I remember I didn't tweet anything about it intentionally cause I was like, wait a minute, it's good for you, please. I was like, wait, wait, wait. Let me get this straight. A woman who I've never heard of before who's not a public person per se, tweeted a bad joke, basically really tasteless, stupid thought. Her life is going to be the short. Why would I add to that? So I really tried to make a conscious decision to just be like, you know, and I do that now and again, we're certain news things where I'm like, this one, I'm going to sit out because we this gang mentality like no one had, you'd know you didn't know who that was before. Nobody knew who this woman was before. But so one random person said something that I didn't like, we must destroy her. So you're right, it is. That's the first pop and now they're, these pops are happening all over the place. Which by the way, is what I, why I think what Peter Teal did with Hogan and Gawker is fucking phenomenal. I agree. Nominal. Right,

Speaker 5:          00:24:47       great. Because there, there's some, there's some violent and aggressive invasion of privacy that's going on with companies that are trying to make a lot of money by doing that. And that's one of the things that a lot of people thought about Gawker. Yeah, I'll do, I did read an incredible piece on Gawker from May, I hate to say this about donald trump's hair or they are investigating donald trump's hair is a very expensive,

Speaker 4:          00:25:09       I read it and they had like a diagram of showing how beers around and like that there's an office in trump tower

Speaker 5:          00:25:17       does that. That's one floor below his and the office doesn't have any, it doesn't have a website anymore. And they've been doing this procedure for like a long time. Yeah. And it's like they essentially, they take a hair and then they, they find whatever hairs you have and they sort of tie this hair onto your hair one hair at a time and it's like some crazy eight hour procedure. And the speculation is that the entire business revolves around maintaining his hair in that manner. Now as someone who, uh, is bald, his balls going to try to do thing violently challenge hair transplants. I went to the big smile scar in the back of my head from you chop out a piece of the back of your head and they tried to put it up front. Yeah. The way I described it as like they take some people that are really healthy and they move into a neighborhood where everyone's dying.

Speaker 5:          00:26:11       That's funny. Yeah. Well I, I was, you know, when I did it, I was in my late twenties and I was, I was just on television and I was panicking because my hair was falling out. I was like, Oh my God, I'm just, my career is just getting started and I'm going to lose it all because I was thinking very probably correctly that a lot of my success is predicated on my appearance. And I was like, if this goes like if I go bald, I'm fucked. They want had shaved heads back then in the nineties either. If they did, it was very rare and a, so I went through all this, but it helped. It definitely gave me like thicker hair, but

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       it was too, it was too much work and eventually I realized like it's so pointless. And then when I shaved my head it was like the most freeing feeling. I'll say I like it better like this. If I, if I had hair right now at fucking shave it. Yeah. I mean I'm holding ground and I, when I looked wonderful, don't, don't go hard on your hair, but I used to have hair over here. You know that that's what happens is as you age. But I know for sure there were times in my life when I was very stressed and I'm not kidding you. I could feel it. Could you feel it when you were, when you were losing hair, could you feel it at times coming out? Not like a, almost like a, not literally like each individual thing, but almost like a, I could feel my tension there basically.

Speaker 2:          00:27:24       And as I, that was just psychological. Yeah. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe your hair is completely connected to your emotions. Maybe you're one of them. That's why I don't smoke pot anywhere cause that's what I would think about. I smoked pot and go, wait a minute, what's going on up there? You know, railing, kind of, yeah. That's the, that's the rub on the pot. Right? But it's fucking with you. Yeah, exactly. Just comes to this. That's why I like the Sativa Endeca. I like pop for that reason though to go to fucking with me. I don't know. It's like that old joke that Kennison used to have about a, they say every man's got a homosexual fantasy. He goes, oh, I'm sitting around the other day. Go on through my fantasies. Because if there's one on there, I want to know. I want to know about it. Did you find yours? I didn't have one. So sorry for your people.

Speaker 2:          00:28:07       So when you see someone that is shaved, that feels good about it, as you said, it's like a burning off all the time of the dudes are struggling. I'm like, just shave your fucking head so that, doesn't trump seem doubly ridiculous to you in a certain way? Well, he's more than doubly ridiculous. He's ridiculous. In a million different wines just on the hair front. Really. I mean that's cliche so we don't have to spend too much time talking about, but doesn't that like if someone who shaved your head, you feel good about it, that he does this thing, this whatever the fuck he did. He always says it's my hair, it's my hair. Which is sort of a cop cause yeah, they're probably doing something by Harris. Yeah. But doesn't it seem doubly ridiculous? And to someone like you like knowing that you shaved and you feel good and life goes on and then I get it from a psychological standpoint, I get it also is a person who likes to have control of their life.

Speaker 2:          00:28:49       You know, like you, you feel like that's one thing that really freaks people out about their hair, but it's like features and an appearance is very bizarre. Right. Cause I know this woman who recently got a nose job and uh, she's beautiful and she decided that she didn't like her nose and she got like a little bit trimmed off. It's kind of crazy, right? Yeah. But there's a weird thing where people decide that if my nose was one eighth of a millimeter smaller, I would feel better about myself. I would feel better about my appearance. But I've met people that have big noses. No, she doesn't look any better. She looked great before. She looks great now. It's just a weird thing that people do. They fixate. But what I was going to get at is it's really strange, like what we decide looks good, you know? And that it's cultural and a lot of ways because if you go to something like, how bout those think it's Sir Siri women who decide, put those giant plates

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       in their lips. Yeah. And the bigger the plate, the more cattle they're worth when they get married. There's like fucking really bizarre cultures. And it's an example of how human beings when isolated for whatever reason, what I mean, there's scar scarf, vacation rituals that many cultures go through with a cut pieces out of their skin to appear to look like crocodiles. And you're seeing that where they do their backs then do it. Yeah. Yeah. They cut these chunks out of their back and then they develop these keloid scars that pop up and they see if you could find that Janet men with crocodiles scarring. But it's, there's so many different scarf, vacation rituals, and look at me, I'm covered in tattoos. There's like weird things that people do to their body and weird appearances that people choose to enjoy or not enjoy it. And it just gets, it gets very bizarre. Like, what the fuck is hair? Why is that guy's back? Oh Man. Oh, I have seen that. Crazy. Yeah, and they just, they cover their entire back with this, that it makes it look like, like a crocodile skin.

Speaker 4:          00:30:46       Wow. Yeah. Well, you know, joy bay heart used to say a phrase on, on the view, dare I quote the view, but joy bay, how are you saying that? I always thought it was great. It was really simple. She usually, they just say it's an inside job, that everything really is just an inside job. So if you're walking around, your friends walking around and she thinks that this little, you're a beautiful woman, but she thinks this little millimeters so it bothers her. For some reason it's an inside job. Now she may still have that same insecurity after, or maybe she exercised it, you know? Or maybe it actually did do what it was supposed to do. But most of us are walking around the ship that we're walking around with is just an inside job and it's your, it's your job as a human to to exercise that stuff. And that's, I mean, I try to do it every day that that's what you're trying to get better is all about. And then we fail at it constantly. I fail every day.

Speaker 5:          00:31:32       But there's also like a certain amount of you that should be upset with the way you look so that you force yourself to go to the gym and he keeps you healthy.

Speaker 4:          00:31:42       That'll west Hollywood. We talked about this last time I was here. You know where every guy is, but they're disgusting, but they're actually disgusting. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:31:50       How so? Because they're just fucking each other in the street cause they're not dogs because you don't want to go to the steam room. I don't know. I just left. I lived in West Hollywood for three years. I never, I went to the Locker Room in that gym, 24 hour fitness once cause I had to pee so bad as Hollywood is the one I always talk about. My friend used to be the manager there. I used to go to the 24 hour bastard. I used to go to the 24 hour fitness and woodland hills and there was a guy that worked there that was my friend who was a manager. They sent him over, he was at another 24 hour fitness but he was like a really good well organized guy, well liked and they sent him to West Hollywood to clean up and he said he got there and dudes were just gone at it in the sauna and they would have to mop it down. He said it was insane. He said it was basically just a gay hookup spot. The whole

Speaker 4:          00:32:35       frankly is disgusting. I made it really real, but beyond just like that, just the sex or whatever, this idea that you have to look perfect and there's never enough. And that's why for me it's like that's why gay marriage was so important. Not because of the weather you want to get married, not is irrelevant. But the idea that all these people that could never get married, they had to stay in the rat race forever. Imagine that if you always felt like you had to stay in the rat race because the same equality of being in a relationship that was sanctioned by the state, as silly as that may all be in at some level, but the idea that you just had to stay in this race forever and then one day you're 50 and you're trying to look like you're 20 because you're still in that race because you never found someone, whether it's a guy or a girl or whatever, that you can start, you know, maturing into some other thing with. Yeah. And that's why your quality was important. Marriage. Equality was important to me, not whether someone actually gets married and Milo and I have great debates on this. Um, but that you got to get out cause there's nothing sadder than, than those people that never stopped

Speaker 5:          00:33:40       to you on the outside. But if those people are on antidepressants and cocaine, they might be having a great time, but maybe they're happier than me. Hash the expendable income. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:33:50       they got her hair plugs and there 10 beyond imagining they look good. I'm not saying they don't look it, but actually they don't look that good because their muscles are too big. You know, they all just, the shirts are too tight. Like it's like settle down everybody.

Speaker 5:          00:34:03       Yeah. Well there's, there's a lot of that going on. I, you know, I used to work out at Gold's gym on coal, which is, uh, you know where that is in West Hollywood. It's like right down the street from sunset and Gower Studios. We used to do news radio at sunset and so there was a gold's gym down the street and I'm like, oh well I'll just make a membership there that way over at lunch I can just shoot over, get a workout in real quick and get by. Because I had just gotten used to like set life, like life on the set, on a new sitcom, you're working at a minimum. If those sitcoms not going well, like Newsradio wasn't really going well in terms of like we're trying to find its legs in the early days and we would work 1214 hours a day and it was really hard to do stand up at night and it was really hard to work out.

Speaker 5:          00:34:45       I was like, God damn man. And same with like my hair. I was like, shit, I got to stay in shape. You know, like there's a lot of scenes on news radio where I had to take my shirt off. That was like a kind of a part of who I was. I don't want him to replace me. I better fucking keep going to the gym and pus on vein. So anyway, I went over to this gold's gym and I didn't know that that was exactly like the 24 hour fitness West Hollywood. It was just a gay disco. I used to feel like a tasty little morsel and a big homos. I would walk in there like a wounded antelope trailing up to the waterhole and there was all these dudes with like scrunchy socks, like from fucking Olivia Newton, John, let's get physical and they would have timberlands on and cutoff Jimmy's we'll wearing animals. It just fucking big yoked up, steroid up dudes just gay or than the day is long. It was a, it was, it was interesting because it made me feel like what it must feel like to be a woman who's not interested in getting hit. Who goes to

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       the gym. Yeah. Well when I first moved to West Hollywood, I first was intimidated by it because I was like, you know, I'm at this gym with all these like huge muscly, whatever. And then as time went on, I started enjoying it because I was like, this is actually ridiculous. It really is a comedy. So if you take it just at that, which that's the level you are taking it out, you walk in there and go look at this idiot and timber who worked out in timberlands. Right? But you're not kidding. They actually do with Jean shorts. It's like, what are you building a log cabin or working out like spending, they're sending rather a very clear message. They're looking for some Dick and this is how you get it with Timberland's. Throw that flag up. Timberland, the daisy dukes are important. There's no, there's no like subtlety and daisy Dukes, daisy dukes on whether you're a guy or a girl. You're looking for Dick, right? Well, the universal flag of, I'm looking for Dick, I got to get some new shorts.

Speaker 2:          00:36:29       Daisy did something about the daisy Dukes, right? Like, and when guys started adopt them, it's like, whoa, all right buddy. But that's, that all goes to like, nobody cares. Like all of this stuff about, what are we talking about? Gay Marriage or any of the stuff. It's like enough already. It's there. It exists. Like plot support, I should say. We want to say one thing. I support you doing whatever the fuck you want to do. If you want to wear a daisy dukes and fuck a bunch of dudes who cares, go have fun. This is, this is a short experience. I'm 49 years old, so I'm almost 50 which is if everything goes great, I'm halfway dead and it's probably not going to go that great. All the accident pot and all that jazz. I have a little faith in some of the robotics that are coming in, some of the gene stuff, but I mean realistically I don't want to plan on that.

Speaker 2:          00:37:12       And then I also got some dose, so you're on the good side of it, but on the good side of it, but there's also issues like fucking asteroids, supervolcanoes Zombie invasion, alien attack. Who knows what the fuck's going to go down in the next couple of decades. But yeah, my point is this is a short ride. It's not that long. It seems like it's a long time when you're young, because when you're 22 you look at 81 god, it's so far away. But when you're 50 and you look at 80 like Yo, that's around the corner a year is not that long. It just seems long when you've only gone through 20 of them in your whole life, you're like, wow, it's so long here. I can't wait until I'm 21 you know? And then all the sudden you look back and you go, oh, this thing happened in the blink of an eye.

Speaker 2:          00:37:55       My from 30 to 40 which I turned this year went so fast. I mean I, I remember my 30th birthday and I remember thinking wow, and now like I'm not a kid anymore. Like, cause I, you can push it into your twenties right? You can get through your 20s and still think you're somehow not an adult maybe or but 30 then you go, well shit, now I'm kind of, and now it's like wow, I just turned 40 and it's like now it's like this is real. This is really real. You're in now. And I think the key is to not even concentrate on that, to be aware of it, to recognize it, to address it, but just to concentrate on, and this is such a fucking cliche statement, but I tried to say it as much as possible, living in the moment, just being here in the taking care of your

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       biology, you know, respect your meet vehicle, take care of that thing, but try to enjoy this thing and live in the moment. And the more you don't live in the moment, the more you get caught up in bullshit, the more it gets away from you. And then anxiety and nonsense and all this stupidity and that kind of goes back to trump with his fucking wacky hair like you not living in the moment. If you're a 70 year old guy and you're spraying your hair down with a fucking gallon of aquanet before you go out and everybody knows what you're doing, everybody knows what you're doing. That's the piece. That's the piece. It's like everyone knows some shame, that fucking head, you're worth $18 billion, whatever the hell he's, maybe he's not really worth that much. Right? There's nothing we have no freaking clue I'd like to do with them.

Speaker 5:          00:39:17       Come on and do it. I'll do it. He did that today. Imagine if he did it today, one day before the election he went in a landslide. He would get there would be such positive real towards him. Like you guys would go, he's wonderful. Larry. David would endorse him. I mean it would be huge. Well, I'm curious as to the backlash against trump, not the current backlash against trump, but when it's going to come from other people because people, when whenever someone is perceived to be a bully, whether he is or not, you can make your own choice decision about that. But I think he is and a lot of people think he is and I think that's also probably one of the reasons why he's been so successful is because he's so ruthlessly competitive and he thinks of himself so highly and those sorts of traits like narcissistic, narcissistic traits are oftentimes very prevalent.

Speaker 5:          00:40:05       And people that are successful in business, like really successful like he is when he puts his name on everything and he's branded everything and everything's trump this and trump that. He has no notion whatsoever staying low key. Well w when you fight against like he's really mad at Alec Baldwin on Snl for doing what I think is hilarious and very, it's, it's really well done. Like that thing that they do grab him by the Bougie, you know, he does that. Alec Baldwin, his best work I think since fucking beetle juice. Yeah. Right. Well what is the one, the one glengarry Glen Ross, probably his best work since the coffee is for closers line has been this shit. I mean it's, it's, it's funny and he gets angry. Like Jon Stewart did a bit, he was doing this, uh, um, stand up for veterans for some sort of a benefit and he did this bit where he started reading off these twitter exchanges between him and Donald Trump that Donald Trump just started tweeting at him in the, in the middle of the night, like a tweet from one 30 in the morning.

Speaker 5:          00:41:05       Have you seen this? Uh, I mean, uh, probably have seen some of the brand new, it's brand new, this standup bit. Oh, you should watch. No, I haven't seen it. So let's pull it up, Jamie, because I, I think Jon Stewart, I think we could actually play this unused. I'm friends with John Stewart. I'm sure he would let us play it cause it's, I think he'd also agree that this is kind of important. Like it just shows you, it's not whether or not Donald Trump's conservative approach and make America great again and not letting in terrorist and all that stuff. All the things you may or not agree with. We're just talking about from a psychological standpoint, from looking at him as a human being. Like there's, there's some thing off here. There's something incorrect about his thinking. Well that's, you're hitting a lot of the, a lot of this stuff. So we can look, let's, let's watch this because it's pretty fucking funny

Speaker 1:          00:41:52       to find out somebody was tweeting weird shit about me.

Speaker 6:          00:41:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:00       So on April 24 2013 at 11:00 AM someone comes into my office and says, Donald Trump just tweeted, I promise you I'm much smarter than Jonathan Leibowitz. I mean, Jon Stewart, who by the way is totally overrated.

Speaker 6:          00:42:21       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:42:22       now I'm going to say something to you. This is real,

Speaker 6:          00:42:25       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:27       And I don't necessarily disagree with it.

Speaker 6:          00:42:34       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:42:35       So, so I said, as you might say to yourself, what the fuck is that about?

Speaker 6:          00:42:43       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:42:43       so we're not quite sure. We can't quite figure it out. So a couple of days later, he tweets, as I've said many times before, Jon Stewart is highly overrated.

Speaker 6:          00:43:01       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:43:02       I swear this is true. He tweets again if John Stewart is so above it all and legit, why did he change his name from Jonathan Liebowitz? He should be proud of his heritage. Yeah, that, that, that guy wants to be president. Okay, hold on, let me keep going.

Speaker 6:          00:43:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:20       Then he tweeted, Jon Stewart, he's a total phony. He should cherish his past, not run from it. So I start to think to myself like, Oh, I think this guy's trying to let people know I'm a Jew. And I think to myself like does it my face to do that.

Speaker 6:          00:43:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:47       Honestly, like where have you seen this face other than a poster for Yentl, right, right. What world are people like Stewart? That's a Scottish name, but there's something about that fella.

Speaker 6:          00:44:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:00       That looks a little shmear. Yeah. It wouldn't be funny if it wasn't so toxically fucking crude and horrible, but so I decided to tweet back at him. Have any people don't know this, but donald trump's real name is fuckface von clown stay.

Speaker 6:          00:44:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       I wish you would embrace the fon plows stick. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:44:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:44       Awesome. You remember by the way, Lincoln used to get into this shit

Speaker 6:          00:44:51       all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:44:56       I swear to God this is true. The man who will more than likely given the FBI's preference be our next president then tweeted amazing how the haters and losers keep tweeting the name fuckface von Karman.

Speaker 6:          00:45:19       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:45:19       They are so original and like no one else is doing. What happened is it turned out a lot of people on twitter picked up on the name fuck face and started tweeting at it. Then you tweets. What's funny about the name? Fuck facebook.

Speaker 6:          00:45:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:42       It was not coined by John Liebowitz stole it from a moron on twitter, so I do back. We seem to have hit a fuckface von nerves today.

Speaker 6:          00:46:09       Silence

Speaker 1:          00:46:12       radio silence. Four days later, I shit you not perhaps the next president of the greatest country in the world at one 30 in the mall.

Speaker 6:          00:46:29       Morning

Speaker 1:          00:46:32       tweeted little Jon Stewart is a pussy.

Speaker 6:          00:46:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:46       Hopeless in a debate with me. Vote wisely this November.

Speaker 2:          00:46:56       Well that that line at the end. Yeah, really says it all right there, but wisely this November, because this is where we're at now and Jon Stewart is a pussy, is that that speaks volumes too. Like who fucking tweet? Something like that. Who's what? Seven year old tweet, something like that was running for President John. I'm going to do something. It's very difficult right now. Oh, I'm going to try to defend Donald Trump for a second on this, which is he is using the system against itself. So he's using the trolling tactics. He knew what, what is his ultimately? Yes. That's all insane. That's all completely,

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       utterly insane. Strange like antisemetic dog whistling. Although it's as if John Stewart hiding the fact that he's Jewish. It talks about being Jewish everyday. Like there's so much bizarre lunacy in there in the comments, but what my best defense of him is not that he look, the guy's obviously a narcissist. He obviously has some sort of personality disorder and all kinds of other shit and and shady business practices and we don't know the taxes and all that stuff. The defense I can give of him is that he's using the system against itself. So all of this corrupt media bullshit, all of this political correctness, all of this, the outrage culture, all the stuff we've been talking about, he purposely does it just to keep his name out there. So these idiots, these, the lapdog media just keeps giving him free attention. And then by giving him free attention, he doesn't have to spend the money, but all the other candidates do.

Speaker 4:          00:48:16       Hillary's outspending him. I don't know what the numbers are, but I bet you it's something like 20 to one and it's like he's just using it. So does he believe any of this stuff he's saying and is that morally wrong and ethically gross? Sure. But he's just using the system. And I think, you know, when people are saying, well, you know, if it had only been rubio and although a lot of Democrats, whenever we'd only been rubio or Romney or Jeb Bush, it would have been so much better. All the shit, whether they're calling him anti women are anti gay or Antioch, they would have been saying it about them too because they did it. I mean, remember what they were saying about Romney four years ago, he had binders of women, he hates women, he hates him. Or like I would probably vote for Romney at this point.

Speaker 4:          00:48:53       He did say binders of women. Right. But it was just, they took it out of context. There's a talking point. I mean that's what politics is all about. What's important to know? First of all, I agree with you and I think his use of really ridiculous statements and stuff is brilliant because he does force the media to report on some of the things he says. But that was 2013 he was running for president then, right? No. So he, he has always used it for his own purposes just to keep his own celebrity out there. Right. So everything he's done from, from any point that I can remember him from in the 80s to forward has been to further his own brand, his own empire, his own money, all of that stuff. And now he's just, he's doing exactly what the media has demanded in a weird way.

Speaker 4:          00:49:36       You know, like the media doesn't even wait for us to get outraged anymore. They, they're sitting there, all of these people at all of these, you know, daily beast, all these sites that somehow we're all considered legit and nothing personal against daily beast. I'm just picking one, but like they're literally just waiting for him to tweet so that they can write the article about the outrage that the tweet, because they don't even wait for us to be outraged. They just start. So it's like he's just feeding them. He's feeding the monster. Knowing it keeps getting more clicks. The more clicks and views he gets, the more they'll want to talk about him. The more money it makes, the networks. It's like he really is just, he's just playing the game really well. He's playing the game brilliantly. I mean he's a great, he'll, he does a great job at it. Yeah. Look, he loves wrestling. I mean he used to do stuff with the WWF b because he gets that and that's what people are missing here. So we can talk all about all the policies and whether he actually has a personality

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       disorder and all that. But in terms of the tactics, he's just doing it. He's just, um, they invited me to go on celebrity apprentice back when we did the second version of fear factor, which I guess was like 2011 or 12 or something like that. I forget what year it was and I should have done it. I didn't want to do it cause I would have had to move to New York for like three months. Right. But my family was down when they are like, let's do it. And I was like, all right, maybe fuck that. I do that. I'm like, I don't know. It's just this, I don't like shit. I don't like showers. You know, I don't, maybe if it was a show that I've watched and joy, but I'd never watched it, but I wish I did now because I wanted it. I would love to have some insight.

Speaker 5:          00:51:06       I love to be around that guy and pick his brain because Jeff Ross was around him when they roasted him for comedy central and he said the guy was very reasonable. And this is when they roasted him. He like, he signed up for the roast and Jeff had a conversation with him. He's like, you know, when they turn to you and they're saying jokes about you, you should laugh because it looks bad if you're just sitting there like you're upset, like, or make you look better if you like. He's like, you're right. Like he like, he seemed very reasonable. I think there's something about, he's very concerned with perception, hence the hair, right? Like he's very concerned with control. It's very concerned with all these different things. So like in a lot of ways, this is sort of a psychological profile as much as it is a presidential race.

Speaker 5:          00:51:44       It's like we're watching two different people that are extremely flawed. Like she is not honest. She, Hillary Clinton is a very, very dishonest person. There's an incredible amount of data to point that she is incredibly dishonest. Whether it's dishonest about the Clinton Foundation, dishonest about the emails, dishonest, completely about Bengazi. Do you remember when they were trying to say Bengazi was all in response to a youtube video, which she knew it wasn't the proven yeah, exactly. Exactly. And it's, it's very, very disturbing when you consider the fact that it's not, that's not, it doesn't disqualify you from running the government. It doesn't like if you're going to have someone who represents the people of, you know, as John Stuart said, and I agree the greatest country in the world, you should have someone who's honest. And he look, even Barack Obama's turned out through these wikileaks, um, uh, releases that he lied about not knowing that Valerie Clinton had that email server.

Speaker 5:          00:52:39       Yeah. He had, you know, he had commented on it and he had emailed her on it. So that's not true. So it's, the whole thing is very, very sorted in many, many, many ways. And you know, Gary Johnson keeps fucking out. I've had him on the podcast before and I enjoyed them. I liked talking to him, but how do you not know what Aleppo is? I didn't know where to Aleppo the way, but I knew what was going on in Syria, but I didn't know the name of the city that was getting bombed. Sure. And of course, look, the media is disingenuous when they, when they find that Aleppo moment with Gary Johnson and suddenly that's the lead story all over the place or for 24 hours, it's all over twitter cause it's like you guys ignored everything he says. So now he screwed up once and now that's the way you discredit him. So I've had Gary Johnson on my show, so I chatted with him. Uh, he was going on Larry King when I was over at or, and we had about a half hour before

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       we went on air in the green room. The guy is, he's a perfectly decent, lovely human being. He's not dumb. He is a nice guy. I would, I would love to smoke pot with them and go skiing. But like, but like, but that said in August, I did a video on my channel where I said, I will support this guy to get to 15% to get him in the, in the debates because we, whether you like him or not, we desperately need another voice. Talk about limited government, talk about why uh, taxes should be low or whatever it is. Now. I failed at that. Obviously I tried but from that point, from about mid August to the debate, he had about 10 horrific moments. Like I actually think as much as I like him personally, he's done the libertarians, uh, and in a certain way the country a major disservice by being so ill prepared for this.

Speaker 4:          00:54:12       So many people would have been excited to have heard an actual imagine if there was a libertarian right now obviously he's not going to win like a Ross Perot type character, Ross Perot type or just someone who had a certain command of the issues because Gary, he's googling all of the reasons that we like him, but he's kind of goofy and silly and you know, he stammers a lot and he speaks in a funny way in his body. Language is kind of, you know, slide in a slippery or I dunno, but the point is, this was the year if there were, if we're ever going to have a third party, a third choice, something like that. This was the year where it could have made a real dent the way Ross Perot did. And Gary could have, it should have been the libertarian candidate more than, uh, Jill Stein, I think.

Speaker 4:          00:54:52       But Gary just at every opportunity to show that he knows what he's doing can, can speak clearly about the issues he failed. You know, he's not, he's for having the government forced the India, Indiana, uh, Baker to bake the cake. Did you not? He's a libertarian. So a lot of these, forcing them to bake a cake. Yeah. So, so he isn't even a great, but I even said this in my video. I said, look, the guy's not a great libertarian. I don't think he's a great candidate. He was a republican and he wouldn't get in New Mexico. He was a republican and he was a good two term governor. Bill Weld, by the way. Yeah. This is running mate, who's the former governor of Massachusetts. Yeah. So if they're both decent fellows, you know what I mean? They're both decent fellows and maybe that's just not what makes you the president.

Speaker 4:          00:55:33       But this was, they missed a huge opportunity. Imagine if there just been a well-spoken libertarian who could just have elicited what the points of libertarianism is. I think it would look, it's not going to flip the election, but it could have done something and, and I think he was the wrong guy. It's a dirty business, you know? And that's one of the reasons why Hillary Clinton is good at it. She's a dirty person. Yeah, I mean I say that with no ill will. I mean I don't hate that lady. What she does is dirty. And if you look at what the DNC did to Bernie Sanders, that's dirty and what she did, as soon as that woman got fired from the DNC, she hires her immediately. I mean it's so incredibly transparent. So think how corrupt really how corrupt this is. And this is again why I talk about the left a lot because they need to call out their side. We will be very, it would be very easy for us,

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       for us to sit here and just mock the right the whole time and we can get further into trump and mock the shit out him and talk about problem is, I don't believe in a left and a right. No, I don't either, but I'm just within the way we have to sort of frame the discussions, you know what I mean? Like, yeah, the labels, they're all ridiculous at this point. But think about how corrupt the DNC is. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was the head of the DNC. They find out she's rigging it for Hillary. She steps down in shame, literally the same day or the next day. She, then we'll start same day she starts working for the Hillary campaign. Then Donna Brazil, who's a, who's a democratic super delegate, right? She's a democratic, super dope. Who CNN had on is a contributor as if she could possibly give you any, uh, you know, remotely honest answer on anything.

Speaker 2:          00:57:08       She then becomes the head of the DNC and then now it's of course come out on Wiki leaks in the last week that she was feeding Hillary questions for the debates so it, so you may hate the Republicans for all the, all your fans out there that hate the Republicans. You still got to acknowledge that there is something deeply, deeply corrupt with the Democrats and Hillary. Hillary's the head of that simply simply put deeply corrupt against Bernie Sanders who's also a democrat. It's like what? What Hillary Clinton is is a hustler and she knows how to put it all together and she's got, and the both of the Clintons, they're hustlers, they keep these people close to them and they, they make sure that everyone is taken care of. Whether it's people from other countries that donate money to the Clinton can foundation, whether it's all these different people, like when you know, when she hired that woman for her campaign, that's not unusual like standard operational procedure for the Clinton campaign.

Speaker 2:          00:58:04       It's like how she's conducted business and it's, that's what we don't like about politics. What we don't like about politics is the cronyism and the established roots that they have developed over 30 plus years in government. So that's what's happening right now is that because of wikileaks, we're starting to see how the sausage is made. It's not just a theory anymore. So for the last couple of years where, where a lot of online people would be screaming about the government's corrupt, the media is in bed with them, you know, they, they are pitching softball interview. So well now we're seeing that it's actually true. Like there's actual evidence in email saying yeah, give softball stories too easy. Reporters at the New York Times don't talk to this person, you know, Blah Blah Blah. We're seeing all of it now and it's coming to a head and then you throw trump into it and you throw trolling and internet culture and you get all of that going.

Speaker 2:          00:58:50       And back to that popcorn that we started with now it's all bubbling at once and you know, it all comes down to tomorrow. And I also think there's waves of this stuff. There's waves of outrage and then the people sort of get resigned to it all because they get their own life calls. You know, like if you really wanted to delve deep into the Clintons or delve deep into trump and just that would absorb every second of your day for decades really, really would with both of those guys. And you've got to live and it's always been like that. Do you remember Jeff Gannon? Do you remember who he is?

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       It sounds familiar. Gimme a little shop again and was a embedded reporter in the White House who actually spent time sleeping at the White House. He had slept in the White House and more than one occasion, and this was during the Bush administration, and he would ask the most ridiculous questions that you would never think that a reporter would ask. Like, uh, like mister president, when are the Democrats going to wake up and come to their senses? It's like those kind of questions, like just completely ridiculous leading questions. Complete softballs. Yeah. Well, it turned out that he, this is like when the Internet was just starting to emerge, right? It was during the Bush administration. It turned out that he was a gay escort and he ran an all military gay escort service any more like fucking dog tags and a towel over his dick. And he was straddled on the ground with combat boots on his, in his online ad that I've seen him at 24 hour fitness.

Speaker 5:          01:00:17       And he's the manager that's the guy with the mop. So they realize that this fucking guy was, I mean this was how they got, I mean, this is how they got the questions that they want to be asked and presented the, you know, the narrative that they wanted to push. But this has always been the case. He's always been ridiculous. People who are almost like vampire familiars who stay close to the master and so they want to, you know, in one way or another, feed off of whatever power that he has and, and capitalize on it, whether it's Debbie Wasserman Schultz, whether it's, you know, what does a woman's name that's the attorney general that Clinton met on the tarmac and his jet. Oh, a lynch. Loretta Lynch. That story. It's fucking insane. They had a private meeting. I mean, trump's been hitting that over the head and he's actually, every time he says it, I'm like, yeah, wait a minute.

Speaker 5:          01:01:09       They had a meeting in the plane for a couple minutes right before the indictment didn't happen. Like, well, that's why people like Scott Adams, who was a very reasonable guy. He's coming on soon. He's great. He will. A little bit of what I said before about the trump tactics, he came on my show and he laid it out so clearly, and he at, at that point, he wasn't supporting trump really, and I think, I think he, I think now he officially his, but his whole point was, it's not the policy. Understand what he's doing, the trolling, understand the leading that he does and then comes in after all of that. He fully gets it. You're, you're going to love talking to them. Yeah. I mean, I feel like what trump represents to a lot of people that are supporting him is they'll, they're willing to look past all of his flaws and all the bullshit and the bullying and the craziness because he's something completely unique that has never run for president before. What he is he, what he represents is a guy who has been inside but is also outside. He is independent in terms of financially and he's also independent in terms of his connections and his obligations to them. One of the things about him being a narcissist and one the things about him being a guy who probably have a whole lot of friends

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       is that in establishing that and becoming the super successful guy who's really concerned only about himself, he's immune to all that cronyism bullshit. He's not going to do that and you're seeing that like the way he's hammering hillary on all these different things, the way he's attacking, I mean he got paid to be at Hillary's fucking wedding or hillary rather got paid to be at his wedding. He paid her donation for her to show up at his wedding or fucked it up. Um, I mean, this is a guy that's been deeply embedded in, in, in politics, but to his credit then he points that out. I mean, in the first debate, the first republican debate, what was, he said it within the first 10 minutes. Yeah, yeah. I gave her money and she showed up to my wedding. That's how corrupt the system is. So you're totally right.

Speaker 3:          01:03:08       What's happening is people are, they're so frustrated, they're frustrated about language and all the bullshit and seeing all the nonsense between the media and the White House correspondence dinner where, you know, they call it nerd prom and all the, they're supposed to be guarding the politicians and instead they're having dinner with them. And we could go through the list of the amount of people that are on CNN that are married to public. People are work for campaigns. You know, I just mentioned the Donna Brazil thing. There's a good Jew, Paul Begala for example, he runs a hillary SUPERPAC. He's on CNN as an analyst like this show, everyone is now seeing it. There was the idea of it. But now because of the Internet, we're seeing all of it and people have just had it. Think about it. Everyone wants to be close to power in a certain way.

Speaker 3:          01:03:47       So if you had a, if you had Barack Obama, you're the president in here, you can probably in your first interview with him, the first time you met him might go a little easier hoping that he might come back again because you'd like to be around it a little. Not Man Dude, I hope, I hope not. You go hard. I would show up drunk and high and I had to go like let's kill it says do this man. Let's just do this. I want to know what's up. But he gets a chance to give you the president. Look, can, I don't want to be president, but likely there would be like some serious consequences if I didn't do that. Right. So, so that's the real concern. So there's two things. There's one is that he won't do. If you ask if you are going to demand a really hard interview, I mean a really, really high degree.

Speaker 3:          01:04:29       They'd be a hard interview. What I would do if I had a chance to sit down with Barack Obama because he's not much older than me. Yeah. He's only a couple of years older than me, like I had essentially could hang out with that guy. I think in a lot of ways, let's forget about what he's done and the drones and the attacks on whistle blowers and the attacks on the freedom of the press. There's been a lot of horrible things that have occurred during this administration. It's been one of the wars administrations in terms of freedom of the press. It's not, that doesn't seem to say much about that. Not at all, cause it's, it's bullshit. That's why I don't believe in this left and right thing. It's like the raiders versus the dolphins. You pick a team and your team can do no wrong. Yeah. What I would talk to him about is what does it like being a human being under that immense amount of pressure. And is that job even manageable? Is it, is it possible for one person to really be for 300

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       and whatever million people there are here? Yeah. Well that's right, but that, but that's donald trump's got to put it into that. People think we're voting for a cane. They don't realize that, you know, there's simple civics things that people need to know that they don't know anywhere. Stuff that you should have learned in seventh grade social studies that we have three branches of government. The president is one branch, he's the executive branch. All he is supposed to do, the president doesn't write laws, right? All he is supposed to do is sign the law. Congress writes the law that the legislative branch and then the judicial branch and the courts actually make sure that they're legal and there's separation of powers in a balance so that they can, you know, checks and balances. So they make sure no branch gets too powerful. But if you think about it, think about what the last two years have been like for this election.

Speaker 4:          01:05:58       People think we're voting on a king. So Hillary, I can solve this and all that. And it's like, wait a minute. If you can do all these shit, why didn't you tell brock these last eight years? I'll bring all the jobs back. Well, you were on his team, so maybe you should have mentioned that. So you know, that's all bullshit. And then when trump says, I'm the only one that can solve immigration, I'm the only one that can make the economy grading. I know. It's like, well, you're just a part of the government. I get it. You're a big part. And we fetishize the president in a way that we don't the other branches, which is a problem. Um, but they're, they're not a king. And we have to remind ourselves of that. And for the people that are really ready to jump off the bridge tomorrow if they're a guy loses or gal or, or Gal.

Speaker 4:          01:06:37       Uh, for those people, the hope is that the system is, can be stronger than either one of these two people. You Ha if, if, if we're not at that point, then we're really in trouble. You already established so that the system itself is just, yeah, it's just busted. It's just busted. But that's why they're voting trump. And that's the thing, that's the thing with trump. If you think about trump, what of progressive hated all these years, they hate Christian conservatives. Well guess what? Trump's not a Christian conservative. He doesn't give a fuck he had, they're all supporting him. I've oddly at the highest numbers, but he doesn't care about that. Do you think trump really cares about abortion? He's an old school pussy grabber. Exactly right. He's an old school pussy grabber. O. S. P. He doesn't care about abortion each Jesus tee shirt. There you go. You can have that one.

Speaker 4:          01:07:23       But he doesn't care about abortion. He doesn't care about gay rights. I think about it. He gave the, the, at the RNC at the convention, he talked about gay rights. It got out of pause, break. He brought Peter Teal up there to talk about being openly gay and they loved him. I mean, so it's a lot of ways stablish that Hillary Clinton was anti gay marriage until 2013 when it became convenient. She is on record many, many times of saying that she believes in a marriage between a man and a woman. Yeah. But that's what just incredibly regressive of, well that's what they all do. They wait now, even Obama, it's like he waited, waited, waited until Obama, Obama.

Speaker 4:          01:07:59       Um, but even Obama didn't do it until Biden was on meet the press and he like kind of slipped. And then the next day Obama was like, me too, you know, saying Mo Bama, Michelle Obama, she ran, she could probably fucking, when you want to talk about a woman who has been in the White House who has shown an incredible resolve at her, the way she speaks, she's, she's like a very intelligent, very articulate, very composed person. I think she could win. Well, what does it tell you though, that I have heard than Hillary? How about that? Yeah. I would probably rather have 100% yeah, 100% so I don't know. I don't even know what she thinks it, but he'll, being a president is, ah, I'm here. I'm sitting here talking about I don't, I just know she's not as compromised. Maybe she would be if she got that job. So is that ultimately where we're at is that the system is so corrupt that all they could choke out all the two years of this bullshit could give us at the end was these two.

Speaker 4:          01:08:57       Like I kind of think they just, they perfectly deserve each other, but if you want to look and find out what went wrong, you got to look in the mirror because we all have to look at ourselves and say, how did we all allow this to happen? It was a joke at first. The trump thing was a joke. I mean, I'll fully own up. I remember when he first got in, I said he's going to be in three debates and that's it. And he was definitely in three debates. He was, yeah. And then he stayed for the fourth and I went, Oh shit, he's better at talking to those people. He's used to being on camera and he's used to insulting people. Like when Marco Rubio tried to insult him, he was terrible. Oh my God. He's like, he's not good at that. Like that's not something you just pick up on.

Speaker 4:          01:09:33       It was like watching an open mic comic half to like headline the biggest show of their life. You know, he just couldn't get the words out properly. But, but to that point maybe so far for all the things that we're talking about, it seems to me that trump, the best sales job I could give her a trump would be that he has a lot, his family has a lot, they have everything to live for. They have everything that most of us want, material assets and what all of that stuff. And it's like, is he really people that are like, he's going to start world war three or you know, we're going to fight North Korea are. But isn't that a real concern though that with his hubris and the way he treats opponents in business and the way he treats opponents socially, like Rosie O'donnell, I go the way he does sort of conduct himself that that is not something that you can do if you want to talk to some foreign leader.

Speaker 4:          01:10:20       Absolutely. It's a con for sure. I, so I'm not diminishing that. We don't, as I say on the show with him, I don't know what his moral center is, you know? I just have no sense of is this really all about him or is this, does he really feel does like in the truest moment of him, does he feel that the country really has been derailed and is he just using the trolling tactics to just get something good out of it? My point is that, that he has, well I was saying he has a lot to lose and it's like maybe he, this is the moment where he finally like came around and was like, I have no one's going to stop this bullshit, this corrupt, all this awful shit that you're talking about with Hillary. And maybe he's like, I'm the only one that can do it. That's, that's the best way I can frame it. I'm not telling you that's, that's, that's a really fantasy based view of it though. It's not based on his actual words, but it's impossible to base any of those. So. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:11:13       So how do we base any of this on their words? We know that is lying left and right. You know what I mean? Well, if you've seen the thing, the difference between the s the FBI director giving the description of what Hillary did and then her saying what the FBI had said. Yeah, and I mean it is so horrifically inaccurate and dishonest. This is like, how does that not immediately disqualify you in any other time? It would because she was running against, let's put it this way, if she was running against Obama and these things, and this is, this was the Hillary Clinton that we had been exposed to. It's like our standards have dropped so low, but the media would have been all over her because they liked Obama. So that's what's happened here. Trump has been the great unifier to take all of these people, progressives and liberals, and we'll all these people and even, you know, the never trump conservatives, all these people, they're all unified in just their hatred of trump.

Speaker 3:          01:12:00       And then that gets them to ignore all the horrible shit about Hillary. So like the stuff with the emails, when she, when the guy basically call me, came out and he was like, well, it wasn't negligent with sort of, he was like, she's basically an idiot. She didn't know what she was doing, but it wasn't negligent. Well, that's grounds to be fired at most jobs if you're, you can't screw up something really, really important and say, well, I didn't do it in purpose. I'm just an idiot who's not. Not, not even that it's illegal and illegal. Who would go to jail? Right. What everything she did, if she was a sailor, you know, you know the story about the, the, the naval officer who took photos and I'm not, it wasn't even an officer as an enlisted guy who took photos of the inside of a nuclear cockpit.

Speaker 3:          01:12:39       He's facing 10 years in jail. Just took photos on his phone. Top secret shit. Well, did you see this in last two days that hillary was having her cleaning lady print emails? Classified emails there. Wikileaks is showing things where she's saying have her print it, have her print deal. She'll over Anthony Wiener thing that she had. Huma, huma forwarded her fucking classified emails to Anthony Wiener's account and then printed them up because I guess his computer was hooked up to the fucking printer in the house so he could print his dick pics. Right. So then, well he was he printing them? Where do you send them once you find the large, I'm otherwise you get no traction. You can't send actual size dick pics. Say ask you this before we get any further, what do you want? Either one of them to win and if you do you have a preference or a you like Iti, want to step back and watch this nuclear explosion.

Speaker 3:          01:13:25       Go off and see what happens. None of those three options. I don't want this thing to blow up. You know, one of, one of the things I say on the show all the time is that our country is still so good and we don't realize it. We think that it's just this endless fighting and this awfulness. There's so much good here. You wake up. I know we're a little, we're a little different as as public people, but the average person wakes up here. They can say what they want to say. For the most part, you can say what you want to say. You can get a decent job. For the most part, where we go to New York City and go on a subway and be with literally every single person from every part of the world, from every, every ethnicity and nationality and religion and race and sexuality, and we're all here and we're not killing each other. That doesn't mean that we could do a lot better. It doesn't mean that the system's broken. It doesn't, but it's still pretty damn good here. Almost everyone in the world still wants to come here. We don't.

Speaker 4:          01:14:11       How many of your friends are leaving America? I know Lena Dunham's going to leave. That will be all right. She's going, if trump wins, you know, like she said that yeah, she'd going to Mexico or Canada. He's got a lot of problems of her own. Yeah, right. Let's not waste that. He, so I was at her butt, but, so my, my overriding point would be I don't want to blow the system up to that level where it's really like,

Speaker 5:          01:14:33       yeah, cause I didn't say, I didn't mean like watch this nuclear explosion go off. I'm at an event like this isn't a tomorrow's and event and we're going to sit back and watch how this event plays out. Who are you? What do you want to say? Who you are

Speaker 4:          01:14:44       voting for him? So look, we're, we're in California, so, so I haven't said this publicly. I figured I would sort of wait until today. So we're in California here. So we know Hillary's Wayne in California. So the two of us have a little bit of a luxury to do something that might be more principled than what that independent, yeah. Then what the average person, if you're in Ohio or you're in Florida or Colorado or whatever your, your votes, Matt, literally every single person's vote match highlights how fucking goofy this system is so completely does. Right. And I now there are people that trading votes over state lines and all kinds of crazy things. Look, my biggest thing this time is that the system is just mangled and we need more voices. So I, my, I'm not totally sure. My gut feeling is I'm going to vote for Gary Johnson for all the wrong reasons because I just want somebody to realize down the road that four years from now we should have somebody else. But I think you can make equally strong cases for trump and for Hillary and equally wrong cases for both of them. Yeah, because everything, cause it's funny, I don't, I'll ask you the same question, but just from what we've talked about here, my sense is you're going to vote for Hillary in the most begrudging possible way. I don't think I am. If I was going to vote for Hillary,

Speaker 5:          01:15:58       so think about this, I would have to, I would have to have a way that I could justify supporting her. Not just a way that I didn't feel like trump should be the president. It's all in my mind for the system, it's, it's, it's, it's far better if it's not even done, it doesn't make sense. I think. I definitely think my options are either voting for Gary Johnson or writing someone in and I don't think Gary Johnson should be pressing. No, I know. Look, he's not going to be, so you can do that. And clean coach, he was president. Look, the guy did a great job as a governor of New Mexico and I mean, what would I find disagreeable about him is so much different than what I found disagreeable about George Bush and George Bush was president for eight years. What I find disagreeable about him, like his only, his lack of preparedness, but I think he's a very disciplined guy. I just don't think he prepared well enough about foreign policy and about a lot of other issues. And I also think the pressure of the national media and the spotlight of that uniquely. Yeah, the Gotcha. Journalism is something unique that he had not experienced before. So I think how depressing

Speaker 4:          01:17:04       that is with everything going on here. And for as much as you and I are in this thing, like in it in a, in a public way that we're, but we both may be will begrudgingly the day before the election kind of be like, ad we're going to vote for the guy that definitely can't win. I mean, think about the shit that you've just said about Hillary that is seriously damning shit. Really Damn Shit. Now look, Sam Harris, who is one of my heroes who I know you've had on a zillion times and I've had him on and he did the best sell job he could on Hillary. He's, he's supporting her. And I think it just is not really, well, it's mostly trump's of funny little article about the, the, the war, you know, to the best of two evils or I mean, not a whole article, a whole podcast about it.

Speaker 4:          01:17:42       Right. And I think he makes some good points about that. He, he absolutely does. And look, I hold him as high as I can hold another, another person. Um, but I think that the, maybe the best way this could go down is that if you don't want the, if you're really afraid of what could happen with trump, that, that it's just like the rules have just changed forever and it just doesn't sound right that trump would be president, United States, this reality TV star. If you're really, really afraid of that. I think the best argument for Clinton then would be that get her in the system basically keeps chugging along and then good liberals and decent conservatives and Libertarians and the people that really aren't on the fringes that are dragging everybody apart. You know what I mean? Like the real regressive left people in the real outright people.

Speaker 4:          01:18:28       But everyone else kind of comes together and says, we're going to change things over the next couple of years. And I, this is, I'm giving you a real like kind of pie in the sky. Like, you know, let's try to spin this positively stuff ABC after school special. Like that's really what I'm giving you right now. Cause I got nothing left with one day to go in this fucking thing. But, but that's what I would say is that it's become obvious to me over the course of this, the average conservative who I may disagree with on taxes or abortion or whatever, they're not my enemy. They're not as a liberal, they're not my enemy. And we can find, we have to find room to be okay with other people. This, all this whole election is just a result of not being okay if demonizing everybody to the point that they're evil.

Speaker 4:          01:19:07       And then what did we end up with? We got this. So the best argument for Hillary I think is let her have for years, the whole thing is going to be scandal written. No matter what she's going to. This is about not letting people just do their own thing. Like that's, that's a big part of what this is. What, what do you mean when you say, explain, explain what you just said about the whole reason why we're in this. We're in this position because we've got cause over the last however long because of cable news. Because a twitter, because of all of that, all everyone caters their news to themselves and then demonizes everybody, right? So everyone on the right will tell you that they're all lived hard, left socialist, Marxist, Blah Blah Blah. And everyone on the left will tell you that they're all racist white supremacist Nazis. And it's like neither one of those things are true. And, and there could be, you know, it's like when, uh, people argue about abortion and it's like everyone on the left will say that the people on the right, they're against abortion, they hate women. And people on the right, we'll say that people on the left are for abortion. So they hate babies. And guess what, it's not really true either. One of those,

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       you got to realize that we, there's much more in common that we all have. I know, you know, this is like obviously like that's not rocket science and we have to realize that people can have different political opinions and that way you can still find some room. There is some place Democrats and Republicans used to work together so well, civility and just common, the common bond of being American and being so incredibly fortunate to be born on this awesome patch of dirt. I mean that's, that's really what we are. We're the lottery winners when it comes to the world and a lot of people disagree. Fuck, you kind of does better. And it was a lot of people, but you know, there be, just ignore them. And I suppose that's where I would live. I didn't live here. I live in Canada or Australia. Those are my two spots.

Speaker 3:          01:20:48       Will Australia. I've had a couple of Australians on places. The Shit, I fucking love us to get the ball. I love the people over there. It's such a fucking great place. Yeah. I Melbourne is fucking fantastic. Sydney is awesome sister. I enjoy it. So they have their problems too. But yeah, I had read up and [inaudible], who's a writer for the Herald Sun in Australia, she's at, born in Iran, moved to uh, Australia, and now she's basically, she's on the right in that she's, you know, she would be considered a republican here and she's actually fighting against immigration the way they're doing it there because she realized how good that country is. She says, Australia is the most tolerant nation on earth, and we're now a unfurling that tolerance by allowing everybody and even if even if they don't believe the things we believe, and even if they don't want to integrate and assimilate properly and all that stuff, well, they're very hard on illegal immigrants.

Speaker 3:          01:21:38       They tend to illegal immigrants. They put them on a boat and the ship into a fucking island, which is happening all over the place and they're sinking boats. I mean, there are videos of boats trying to get to Greece and they're just literally sinking. Right. Um, but, but Australia, Canada, yeah. There's some other places that are, that are pretty good. But the fight against people who disagree and the demonization, I completely agree with you on. I think that we have a real problem with teams. We have a really real tribal mentality when it's a team of the ride or a team of the left or even a team of the independence. I've been seeing so many people and I've been so disappointed with so many people ignoring all the things that Clinton has done and using that Hashtag I'm with her, especially my friends that are women that are really excited about having the first woman president and like this one, this, this is the one you want like this is, this is like if you wanted to have the first woman president, like wouldn't you want to have a woman who was like Obama when he ran for president was a perfect candidate and a lot of ways and a perfect response to George Bush.

Speaker 3:          01:22:41       I mean take away all the things that he didn't do that he had offered in his whole hope and change campaign and there's so much that he went against, especially really disturbing stuff like the whistle blower thing, like he was offering support for whistleblowers and saying that people were doing illegal activity and they expose that there'd be protected, which has been absolutely not the case. That's to me is like super disturbing and I think as many

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       people said, he's going to be on the wrong side of history when it comes to that stuff, but I don't know how much control or power they really have. I don't know. I don't know what kind of influences the president really has in that position, but my point is he was a great candidate. Hillary Clinton is not a great candidate. She's just not. She's a scary person in a lot of ways. All this shit that she's been saying about Russia being a part of the attack and the hacks on her email server and the DNC, that's all bullshit. Well think about improving, but she keeps saying that she's offered up the fact that she would respond militarily, militarily against Russia for her writing a bunch of fucked up shit in emails and getting caught for it. Right. So the way you know that it's actual bullshit and you're not just giving hyperbole there is that if they were doing the things that now the hillary campaign is claiming and they do it very caring, they're very careful with their words where they never flat out condemn them for, you know, it's both.

Speaker 4:          01:24:01       It has to be coming from the road room and it's all, it's all, you know, it's a magic trick to keep you off the topics of the emails, which is really the stuff we should be talking about. But the way you know it's really not real is that if it was real, let's say there was real evidence, the CIA or the FBI or NSA or whatever had real evidence that Russia was genuinely rigging our elections either with trump or without trump or whatever it, that would truly be an act of war at this point. That would be an act of war and Obama would have to be talking about it endlessly because that's an alley that like the term rigging the elections and interfering with the, when you say Russia, do you mean a guy in Russia? Like, cause that's like a guy in America could have hacked into that sheet.

Speaker 4:          01:24:41       Do you mean Putin directly? The government or do you mean Russian hackers? Russian citizen. The person who has no connection whatsoever to the Russian governor who may have gotten your shit. Yeah. So what about this? Have you thought about this? So all this stuff comes out wikileaks. Let's go on the assumption that Hillary is going to win tomorrow. What if, and I, you know I say this with a, I always quote Carl Sagan on this one, which was extraordinary. Claims require extraordinary evidence. But what if wikileaks or the Russian government or whoever it is is right? What if they're saving the real shit until she's president when they release it today? No, we're not. If you really want it to blackmail the president of the United States, black male. But yeah, if they wanted to look, they want money or something or they want some [inaudible] global trade agreements or whatever.

Speaker 4:          01:25:25       No, no, no. That, that you release enough so that she's damaged. Now she gets into the White House and then either you start continually leaking more. Cause I suspect they've got plenty more. You continually leak more to hamper her or you actually then have some shit over. Like what if there's some real shit, you know, that she was, she facilitated, you know, something worse in Libya or you know, like some other thing and then they could potentially have some shit on her, which then could actually lead to a war with Russia. Again, I'm just that fully, I fully throw the Carl Sagan caveat out there when I say that, but you have to think like they have a political motive. They're not, they're not an a organization.

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       Clearly they want to damage hillary. So I think there's something there. You're giving me the skeptical eye, which is I, which is great. Yeah, I think that's a lot of speculation. I think. Yeah, it is for sure. It had anything big, it would've already been out. I mean, everybody got a couple of hours left. I don't buy it. I think they would have released it yesterday or well, maybe not on Sunday. Nobody's paying attention, but I just think that there's no way they would've waited this long. Look, the FBI saying that they're going to reopen the investigation was one of the most damaging things and that came from the investigation of Anthony Wiener and had nothing to do with wikileaks. Yeah. It came from just them looking into this other creep and finding out that he's sending his dick pics to some 15 year old girl or whatever the fuck he was doing.

Speaker 3:          01:26:44       I just don't think there's anything there. I think what we've seen, we've already seen, so we have it. We really have, I think the most damaging thing, in my opinion, was Colin Powell, his impression of her. That was, it was horrific because Colin Powell is such a respected person. You very rarely hear anything negative about him, and he essentially said that she's a moron. You mean or not not a moron and intelligent person who's Hubris fucks up everything, which is a way of being a moron and that you know hill. The thing about bill out dicking Bimbos hilarious, you know, and he still is. And then when Donald Trump brought those women than he, you know, he's allegedly sexually assaulted and he brought them and even raped. Yeah. Allegedly brought them to the debate and had them sit there. There's a photo of a bill looking over it.

Speaker 3:          01:27:31       Those women. Have you ever seen that? I've seen it. What in the holy fuck was on his mind when he took, when the impression, you know, that he's giving while he's looking over at those women like that. So doesn't that go to why people are voting for trump? Yeah. One of my best friends, since I'm four years old, he does not care about politics at all. Could not care less. I don't even know that he could name the vice president. He has been all in on trump. I've never talked more politics with him ever in our entire lives. My best friends is a right wing guy. He's completely a political, he's not big on the government in general. He doesn't care if you, he doesn't care what you do. Don't hurt him. He live and let live. That's his whole, I don't think he's ever voted.

Speaker 3:          01:28:09       I mean this is a great guy, but that he just has nothing to do with politics. He's been all about trump because his whole thing is the system is so gross. We all know it and now the guy's exposing it and he's willing to take that risk of what that might mean. Isn't that sort of what Scott Adams and saying that that's basically the thrust of it, that people are just saying, we all knew it was fucked up. Now someone's showing it to you and your, but you don't like how he behaves. You don't like how he talks about pussy. You don't like that. He says mean things to Rosie old, old, truly gross things. I'm not defending any of those things, but like when someone's actually pulling the curtain and showing you the wizard and now the wizards a little weirder than you like and they go, oh, forget that. Yeah. Like let's pull the curtain back and get another curtain and you know, and that's what they were all afraid of. They're afraid of this is their chance. And if they blow it, it'll never that the machine will just swallow everybody up. I don't think machine swole and

Speaker 5:          01:29:01       shit. I think what we're seeing is the inevitable demise of a system that's wholly incompatible with the Internet. Yeah. I think, I love that. That that's what's happening. That's what's happening. This system, you cannot exist in a world where I think all communication within the next 20 years is going to be transparent. Your emails to Jamie, you know, your tweets to your mom, whatever the fuck you're doing. I think it's all going to be transparent. I don't think, I think what the Internet is providing and what modern, um, communication is providing is almost instantaneous access to data and to the way people feel and express themselves. And what we were talking about earlier with these little pops of popcorn, the, that they're going to boil up to a gigantic, but it's going to, technology's not going to stop here. It's not like what we can do now is as much as we're going to be able to do in the future.

Speaker 5:          01:29:56       No. It's going to continue to progress and it's going to get to a point where there's not going to be, the deception is going to be impossible. So that's what it is. That's what it is. Cable News is deceiving everyone we know, they're deceiving everyone. They're sleeping with the people. They're supposed to be taken care of. All you know what you're supposed to be watching. Sorry. And now we're exposing it. So think about just what we've done here, whether if we got one decent point and the in the however long we've been sitting here, if we got one thing out 15 years ago, you could not do this. You could not have two people fully unfiltered for this amount of time doing what we're doing. So if we manage one cogent point in this whole thing, that's more than you could have got out 15 years ago.

Speaker 5:          01:30:33       Well, it's definitely more than you're ever going to see on networks because networks have an obligation and they have an agenda. And I was going back and forth and I tweeted about this, that was going back and forth between Fox News and CNN. One night I just sat in front of the TV. My wife and kids were out and so I was just sitting in front of the TV. Stone is fuck flipping through the channels going back and forth between CNN and Fox and I was Goddamn bewildered. I was like, I'm watching two different worlds, two different plants, like there's two different parallel universes in a one parallel universe. Hillary Clinton is, you know, the savior of the world and the other one, she's a monster and Bill Clinton is a rapist and a sexual Predator and these women are a bunch of Bimbos or just came out against Donald Trump and they're all puppets and Gloria all reds in on it and all this craziness.

Speaker 5:          01:31:19       And I'm like, what? What? What would a person think if they had, this is their first exposure to human beings. If an alien came here from another planet and there's first exposure to human beings was looking at this process to decide who controls the button, then that has all the nuclear weapons of the world pointed at various countries. I mean, this is insanity and this is an insane way to communicate. So how do, how do we then as as the, the neos of this, of this matrix, right? How do we then keep emboldening? I mean, I guess we just have to keep doing that for the building. There's an inevitable process going on and it's, it's going to, it's

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       going to, it's going to overwhelm what we consider to be normal communication. It's going to overwhelm that and right now I think we're at, we're at a very early stage of this technological progression and I think we're looking at, in terms of the Internet and devices and phones and laptops and shit, but I think new technology is going to emerge that's going to foot look. No one would have ever thought that you would have people addicted to a phone. Just 20 years ago. No one would've ever even considered the idea of being addicted to a phone, that you would go to a restaurant and 80% of the people would just be on their phone and no one likes it when you bring it up. If you say to them, hey man, want to get off your phone? Like, fuck dude, I got important emails coming through.

Speaker 3:          01:32:43       Everybody gets mad. It's like, you know, you like saying, Hey, do you really need that drink? I fuck him off that track. It's the same goddamn feeling. People were responding to an addiction, but this is just step one man. This is step one of an ultimate complete invasiveness. There's going to be some new technology, whether it's a neural implant or whether there's some other device that we're going to wear, but there's going to be something that connects us far more intimately with each other than what we're experiencing now, which is pretty God damn intimate. Yeah. Wouldn't it be nice? I had a guy who was running for the transhumanist party [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          01:33:20       Yeah, so that's what we talked. I mean we spend, as I'm sure you did, we spent the hour basically talking about all that, that think about it. We're not talking about it this look, it's not that this shit's happening tomorrow, but instead of talking about grabbing pussy and emails, we should be talking about some of these things, some of these actual things that are going to shape our lives and we don't talk about any of this stuff. And then the shit just happens. And then instead of talking about it and preparing ourselves, we react. But we need to do a little legwork so that when this stuff comes, whatever it is, we have to be ready for it. And we don't. So one day the robots will be here and we're going to be bound down to him because we didn't do the Legwork to go, Huh, you know what they were gonna turn on us.

Speaker 3:          01:33:58       We should have, uh, well, I don't necessarily know if the robots are gonna turn on us like the, that's the big concern that a lot of people have. Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, the artificial intelligence. I think before then we're going to integrate. I mean, I think before virtual reality you're going to have augmented reality and I think that augmented human beings, human beings that are augmented with technology, that's really going to be what's going to separate us from what we are now, which is essentially the monkey holding the device. I think the device is going to be in the monk. We'll look at all ten's got the chip in him and he can open his garage door and strength and he's, he was talking about a guy that, you know, he knows a guy that wants to chop his arm off to get the bionic arm to be able, you know, and get Wifi in your arm and Ooh. Yeah. And then somebody hacks into the Russians are going to hack his arm. That's gonna jerk his own dick off. Leaders going to do with this robotic. Oh boy. Yeah. You think we're in shit now. I think we should go into stand up. I've been saying that for years. It's a really good public speaker. He's obviously fucked off. He's got all the traits, you know, he's got everything going on. They get them in stand up. I think he's

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       probably pretty fucking funny. He looks, he looks funny. Yeah. He's a great face for it. Yeah. The wrong line of business politics are essentially show business for ugly people. Guess what sounds comedy, you know, comedy, you knows there's been some really not very good looking people that have done a wonderful job of, uh, telling jokes and becoming famous. I think we look pretty good relative, relative Max. Yeah. I mean, I haven't been doing stand up much in the last couple of years, but I think relatively speaking, we gotta be on the higher end of relatively speaking. And tosh is probably number one, that handsome bastard bastard. Beautiful Hair. Fuck beautiful man. There's a few of them like that. Sebastian, he's a good looking goddamn guy too. There's quite a few, but now more so than ever in the past that was happened to the fat slob and Lee comedian I would know.

Speaker 2:          01:35:42       But I'm talking to Lucy Kay embraces it. Lou Anderson, and he just, I was happy that he wanted that. Yeah. That he won the Ralphie May, right? Yeah. Ralphie may takes us to the whole new level. Yeah. And he's like a Bruce Lee of, well, there you go. Something you wouldn't say in front of him. No, I would, he knows what he is. Yeah. It's not the worst thing in the world. Um, well whatever. I just, I honestly believe that we're at a tipping point in, uh, in human civilization. And I think that what this election is exposing is how ridiculous our processes that our process was created by people who used to write with feathers. You know, I mean, it really was, it was created by people who rode horses to get around and you know, they needed a representative government cause there was no fucking way are you gonna be able to talk to someone in Missouri, right.

Speaker 2:          01:36:33       It would take forever. And so they needed someone to talk to those people and then get the word back to Washington. We don't need that anymore. It's an archaic system. And then an archaic system is in many ways being exposed. Um, I made a tweet recently or an instagram post about this guy that was going over the electoral map, like a storm was coming. He was like [inaudible] and all the states. And I was like, this guy is like talking about storms. He's talking about, he's doing a forecast. Like this is so bizarre what we're seeing now. Well you're, you're so right. I mean just on the technology front and how we vote, it's like every state has two senators. And the reason they did it back then was because they wanted to make sure that the states like Montana that have nobody living there had some sort of representations.

Speaker 2:          01:37:11       So they needed to make sure that the train with the president campaigning would actually make it there or the horse and buggy or whatever it was. And it's like now it's all changed. So everything being equal, even though I'm not for changing a lot of the, I certainly wouldn't be for changing the constitution, but like the fact that Montana has two senators and California has two senators, California has like that. What is it like the 10th biggest economy in the world? Right? Something like that. So it's like, that's not right. Right. You know, technology has changed, so it's not necessary anymore. The people in Montana can hear all the same shit that the people in California have. So there are things that are happening now that the system, because it's so ingrained and because the people that control it and the money, I don't even think that's a conspiracy. I think that's just the way things work. It's just, it's so grained. You know what

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       we love about the constitution has essentially already been violated by the Patriot Act, the Patriot Act to the NDA. There's a lot of weird shit that's already in place that kind of takes away from the things that the founding fathers had set up to make sure that tyranny was never embraced. That we, we, we, we have these things that we established a long time ago that we think of when we think of what the United States is. Freedom of speech, freedom of speech. Um, you, you have a right to a fair trial when you don't anymore with the Patriot Act. And with indefinite detention that was provided by the NDA, they could kind of put you in jail for whatever they decide. They put you in jail because you represent a threat or that you are on a terrorist watch list or whatever. And if they decide that you're a threat to America, you, you really don't have the right to a trial, they can just lock you up.

Speaker 5:          01:38:47       I mean, look at what the fuck they did to Chelsea manning. Yeah, I mean, to this day she just tried to commit suicide again apparently. Yeah. This, this whole, I mean not to me disturbs me almost as much as anything. The Way Julian assange just like trapped in a house in London and can't leave. He's in an embassy. So what does that tell you then about the progressive's that we're all about this right? They were all about Chelsea manning. They were all about getting all the information when it was all breaking. I was completely with them. It's, I'm all, you know, like look, I believe that governments should be transparent, but there is some shit. Are you with me on this? That some shit has to go down that we can't know of. Absolutely. Yeah. Like that's, I just think it's when people want everything to be fully transparent, it's like put it, the problem is who gets to keep those secrets and why the regular folks as a regular person get to keep those secrets over the American people?

Speaker 5:          01:39:37       Well, I dunno. I Dunno what the right answer to that is other than there has to be, you can't have everyone walking around with all the knowledge. That's a problem. And I think someday that's going to be inevitable. That's what I'm saying about technology that eventually it'll just unfurl the whole thing. It's a bottleneck is there. And I also think the bottleneck is going to occur with money because I think money right now is really just numbers mean money isn't backed by gold anymore. It's just numbers. It's just numbers on a well. So that means it's data. So that means it's information and information. It's going in the direction that information is eventually going to be completely transparent. You're gonna be able to share information back and forth. I don't know if we're going to be able to hold onto this concept of money. I think the concept of money that we have in our, it's connected to civilization and that in itself is only a few thousand years old. I mean if you look at the invention of money before that, it was sort of like trading in goods and services or whatever it was. You're going back what, 20,000 years, 30,000 years. Human beings have been around for a long fucking time. Culture's been around for a long time. I thought like 10,000 years. Human beings in this current state are incredibly recent where we're not even dealing with gold anymore. Now we're just dealing with numbers. I think the

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       next step is that you can't keep track of that anymore. The next step is going to be a resource based economy, meaning that people are just going to be sharing and trading and resources and we're going to have to figure out some way to quantify those resources and quantify your value and I don't think it's going to be the way it is now where you have these hedge fund managers and these Bernie Madoff twats that are fucking just essentially moving numbers around and making ungodly sums of money. I mean, if you look at the Hamptons, a lot of those fucking people that have these castles out there and then in the castles in Connecticut, you have these people that have just figured out a way to move numbers around. That's all they're doing. They're moving playing tricks with the system basically. Yes. They're extracting money from a broken system.

Speaker 3:          01:41:37       Well, that's why I think that, you know, even when people come after trump on the money stuff, you know the whole thing with the $918 million in the write off and all that. Yes. Now look, we don't know. We haven't seen his taxes. He made it the election tomorrow. He made it without John's talk city. Do that because again, it's just trolling the system. But do you remember when, when Howard stern was running for governor and they were forcing him to reveal his taxes and he went, fuck you, I'm out. Oh, I remember that. Was that what happened to drop? Basically? Howard's a very wise guy. So I would, I would imagine that he knew that was going to happen and didn't really want to be governor anyway, but when he was running for governor, that was the heart. That was a hurdle that they told him he had to expose his taxes to Howard's credit.

Speaker 3:          01:42:16       And I love, love, love Howard. Um, you know, did you see a couple of weeks ago they were, people were asking him to release all the trump interviews from all the years, from the 20 years, and he said, no, I'm not going to do it. Because when people came and come to my studio, it's, we're playing a game, sort of we're talking about women were, and it would add nothing to this. And, and Donald Trump is a good sport about it. So for me to betray that it would be betraying my own self. I thought it was a pretty great principled statement by him. That is great. It's also taking it out of context, the context of being on the stern show, but didn't do, they did use some of the stuff that he said, so they got supporting the war. So I think somebody else had that video. But I guess there's apparently archive full of stuff that I guess he owns or, Oh, okay.

Speaker 3:          01:43:00       Well, I mean there is of, there's a time and a place for things, but there's also, you have to think that this guy was not running for president back when he was saying those things. I was just being a silly man on a silly show where it's all about humor and you know, being a good sport and playing a role as Howard put it. Maybe you're paraphrasing him, but I think that's, that's pretty accurate. Yeah, so he was, yeah, he was playing the game. I thought that was, you know, look, he would've had an opportunity to get him in the mix again. You know, may, you know, more publicity for him. And he said, no, that's not, that's not what the purpose of what I've built here for the last 40 years is, and I'm not going to throw in on this garbage. So I thought it was pretty good.

Speaker 3:          01:43:38       Well, you know, I'm sure he probably realizes that if he ever decided to run for government in the form, now the same thing would be used against him. But what does that say about an std? Not Him. You know who he is, is you ask him, what are your well considered opinions on things right now? And then, you know, the woe in 1989 you've said, you know that this person's a monkey and you know, and like think how fucking dangerous that is. So from the, from the limited amount that I know you, I, you seem to me to be an extremely principled person. You have a code that you live by, you, you care about honesty and being forthright and, and all of that stuff, right? Think of all the things that you've said here about doing drugs or sex or, right, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 3:          01:44:20       Someone like you would never want to run for president ever. We could, you even possibly fathom running five wouldn't want the job. But if I did, if I did run, I don't, I don't want to. But if I did, they would definitely use all that stuff against. And that's why context is so incredibly important. And this is also an incredibly new thing with human beings. Being able to extract little soundbites from things that you've said and whether it's a tweet from justine sacco or whatever the fuck it is. And then say, this defines you this moment. This one moment defines you. This one moment where someone cuts you off and you go, you fucking cunt, and you lay on your horn. This is Dave Rubin that you want Dave Ruben running your country. What if that was your mom that cutoff? Dave Ruben. What if that woman was headed to the hospital?

Speaker 3:          01:45:05       What if her baby was dying in the backseat and Dave Ruben called her con? I mean, you know, that's, I'm trying to, I'm just throwing little, little, uh, whatever. I just think that that's the problem. That's the problem that you can't think of. I mean even I'm not, all I'm doing right now is saying what I think as it comes out of my brain, right? I'm not freaking me out. Yeah, it's, it's, it's wild. But it's all freaking me out. But that's all we're doing here. But anyone, anyone that doesn't like us or wanted to discredit us or anything and you know, not to bring it back to Sam again, but you know, the types of things that people with really awful intentions have done with misquoting him and all that stuff and that thing needs to be destroyed. That outrage monster that we'll find one thing that you did or said once to then destroy every other piece of goodness that you've put out there must end.

Speaker 3:          01:45:55       And that's, that is a big piece of what's happening here too. I also think discourse in particular like discourse against Sam is, is what a lot of people are doing. They're playing a game and Sam has a high profile and they're using their voice to attack that high profile to make a move on the castle. You know, it's like they're moving chess pieces around and they're using strategy and they're saying, well, he said this about Islam, you know, and do you understand how many billions of people or a peaceful Muslims and how offensive this is to say that they, you know, and that that's what they're doing there. They're taking these positions and they're also taking these positions in a weird way because there's something about writing a blog. It's a very cowardly thing when you're attacking someone because they don't respond. They just, I mean, you want someone to respond back in a blog, you're requiring an incredible amount of their time sitting there and formulate another blog, but then you know that, that it's a one way dialogue. Or if someone writes an attack blog on Dave Ruben. Yeah, they, that's a very cowardly

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       thing because what they're doing is they're sort of forcing you to respond by establishing a false narrative are by portraying you in an unfavorable light by taking things out of context and using them. And I'm, I do people do it against me. And it's, it's almost, it's funny when you read,

Speaker 4:          01:47:06       you read it, you're like, wow, this is weird. Or that someone split, spent so much thought on extrapolating something that you said that you didn't either mean or it's like, wow, you really went deep on my psyche in a way that had nothing to do that. So you, you know, this Guy Mike Cernovich by any chance? Yes. Okay. Have you had them on? No, I have not. So I'm going to smoke some pot. Yeah. Smokes and is all freaking me out. I'm kind of freaked out for a, I can't smoked the sativa. Sorry. But, um, so, so Mike Cernovich I've had on my show, he's, he's big within the, he's the pro trump guy and, uh, I'll try to make this really deep. So yeah. Man. Really appreciate it, dude. Um, anyway, uh, w from having him on, I got more shit than I've had than anyone else that I've had on because you had them on because I had, because he was sort of a cause he's thought of as part of the alt right.

Speaker 4:          01:47:52       He apparently he had tweeted like three years before I had him on the show. I didn't even know who he was until about two weeks before I had him on. But about three years before that, he had tweeted something that sounded like he was a rape apologist, but it was either a bad joke or it was a little unclear, rewarded clumsily or whatever. Remember what it was. We, it can put, we can probably find it pretty quick, but I don't, I don't remember exactly what it was. But then suddenly I got all these people saying, you see Ruben had a rape apologist on, he must hate women or you know, something to that effect. And it's like, what you guys are doing is just, you're picking, okay, so should I let you pick who I talked to? You know, and that's like you should have the guy on, you'll get a certain amount of hate for it, but you'll have an a really interesting conversation with him, haven't you had

Speaker 5:          01:48:35       people that you've communicated with that you thought were one way and as you got to know them better and better, you found out some stuff they had said and you might, Whoa, I'll call it. There's some things that people say that is just absolutely are inarguable. You can't, you can't support it. You know, there's, there's certain things that people have said that inexcusable, right? Of course. And you, you might come across those two. So I could see the point of taking some things and maybe they might be even out of context and using that to sort of like say at the very least consider this.

Speaker 4:          01:49:07       Sure. But as an, as an interviewer, you're not, you're not, you or I are not held to. If we had to basically vet every person that we ever sat down with for every thought that they had three years ago on twitter, we would be, I have a pretty Brooke and lonely life. I'm out some pretty offensive people on for sure. I've gotten a lot of shit for the Milo interviews. I've gotten a lot of shift for some other people that have so do you, so, so Milo, I really like my life. I had him over for dinner. I've gone out with him. I think he's a good guy. He's, he say shit that I would not say it's working. That's why we're talking about a much like trump. Yeah. And that's why trump has done. Exactly. And then when they ban Milo, what do you do?

Speaker 4:          01:49:43       You make him stronger. The strategy effect. You make him stronger. I spoke, I did a speech at a, at Ucla with Milo were just a little back and forth chat thing. They had all of these kids out. So first of all there were hundreds of kids trying to get in. But then there was this loud 200 kids trying to literally block people. So they're not against walls. They don't, you know, they don't like trump's wall, but they're okay. But blocking a wall for other people to exercise their free speech and they're dumping garbage cans and spitting on cops, getting in cops faces with cameras, like just begging them to just flip in a second. Anyway, we have this great chat. Um, it was really funny actually, at one point, this girl in the audience, she just busted about halfway through, starts screaming. She got an a, you know, people weren't, didn't know she was a protestor. She gets in, she starts screaming, I hate you, I hate you, blah blah. So I stopped and I said, I bet you actually we were going to do a q and a at the end, but I bet you right now if you ask my little one question that you really have burning or make one point, I bet you he'll respond to you. So I stopped the show ready for this. So I said, do you have one point? And the girl

Speaker 5:          01:50:42       goes, hey yo. And it was like, well, she's a kid, but that's how stupid these people, are they stupid or are they just kids? Like when you're talking about these kids that are protesting and stopping people from going into lectures or some of these crazy feminists that have uh, with, you know, the scene from the University of Toronto, very famous thing where they had this guy, they completely misrepresented his opinions on things and they had painted this guy out to be anti female and anti woman and as some sort of a men's rights thing, which is a very bizarre thing. Like you have to deny that men's rights are applicable. Like it can't, if you can't be a feminist and also recognize men's rights, it's very, it's very, very bizarre of a thing going on where it's as much as trying to get back at the perceived winners of the world when you feel like you've been a loser of the world.

Speaker 5:          01:51:31       That's where I think white privilege is coming from and a lot of this stuff, not to deny that white people have it easier than black people in terms of dealing with racism, but it doesn't mean that those white people are racist. There's a lot of white people that are your allies, like the, the, the real problem is the racist themselves, not people who aren't victim of the racist. It's like saying that these people are lucky. Yeah, for sure. But painting it this some sort of a way like where these privileged people, they're assholes for for allowing this privilege to even take place. Now the problem is always singular. The problem is racism itself, the racist themselves, the problem, not that people aren't victim of the individual, not the collective and this is what the left is doing that is literally destroying culture and it destroyed.

Speaker 5:          01:52:17       We've man, I think it's going to pull back just like waves always do. I think there's cycles to things. I mean I think that's why we went from the 60 to the seventies in the 70s to the 80s I mean I think this is what I mean. It also responds to the condemnation of psychedelic drugs and sweeping schedule. One Act that passed in 1970 which was directly attributable to the Richard Nixon realizing that a lot of what was going on while the people are coming after him or part of the psychedelic movement, all these Republicans started like, we've got to stop this. The psychedelic movement will destroy our culture. You go from this gold water republican era to all the sudden you're dealing with freaks and hippies and Jimi Hendrix and Janice Joplin, and they're like, stop the fucking fire. They just threw as much water on it as they could.

Speaker 5:          01:53:01       It locked a bunch of people in jail and they created laws that made marijuana in particular and all these other drugs. They demonize them so that they could go after the civil rights movement that people that were in charge of it, they got them for drugs and so they would go after all these different anti war protest movements. They would go after them for drugs too. And that schedule one classification of these things that weren't dangerous or deadly or killing anyone was directly attributable to a strategy where they were going after people that opposed the Vietnam war going after people that impose the administration, clearly lying to them about all sorts of things. And that was before they even knew that the Gulf of Tonkin was a false flag. The original thing that got us into Vietnam. So there's so many, there's so much evidence that that this, this way that people behave when they suppress things that it has.

Speaker 5:          01:53:54       There's a direct response, first of all. I mean, if you attack someone, they're wounded, they're damaged, and then they rise up and they'd go after that attack. And that's what you're seeing with the alt right. And I don't know if there, I don't agree with him on a lot of things they stand for, but I recognize it almost as if I, I'm not objective, right? I'm a person, I'm a human being. Like all of us, I have my own shit. But if I was outside of it, trying to look at it objectively, I'm like, oh, this thing goes like this. And then it goes like that and it goes like, it's like a fucking swing. It's like a pendulum. It's like a Yin and a Yang. It comes in and it comes out. And I think one of the things that's happening with this alt right movement and these people that are really super conservative and the build that fucking wall build a fucking wall, what you're dealing with is a response to what they perceive to be.

Speaker 5:          01:54:39       Too much openness from the Obama administration. This fucking look, Obama care, I don't know enough about it. I don't, I don't know enough about it, but I have friends that are doctors who fucking, hey, I got a friend in docker in Texas a and they, and they spit when they talk to you and they get red in the face and then they have to stand back and take a drink. I mean, I know people that lost a practice. I know a chiropractor lost his practice because of it. So I think there's, there's a lot of people that are upset at anyone who's the president. Anyone who's the president, if you don't get fucking shot. Miss is a joke that I have for my last special. Who Do we like? Kennedy and Lincoln. That's what you like, but you didn't get shot in the head. We were like, you fucking sell out.

Speaker 5:          01:55:21       What did you do? I think that that is just the natural reaction when we always have, and I think that's why we go left, right. Left, right. I don't think it's a coincidence that we go right from George Bush to Bill Clinton to George W. Bush. I don't think that's a coincidence. Yeah. I mean I think that's a very clear response. Or The com, the government's like, Whoa, now we're this. And the people like, well that doesn't fucking work either. Let's try this. And then they swing back and forth. Well then what do you make of what's happening now? [inaudible] she's very hockey. So you think it actually is a swing back, right? I think there's two factors here. There's the woman factor, which is gigantic cause there's a lot of women that vote and a lot of men are fuck ups right there. They're probably going to vote. I would imagine that women out vote men, I really think they probably do.

Speaker 5:          01:56:06       I don't know. I'm just totally guessing. Let's find out Jamie. But I would say that there's a slight advantage. I would say that maybe it'd be like 46 54 for women in favor of women that more women vote. But I think that you're, you have also is, there's no good choice here. So this is a very unique situation. You have this really strong anti woman feeling that a lot of these gals get from Donald Trump, especially now. Right? There's that. There's the the again and that conversation that he had on that bus, I've heard way worse for some people that I love and cherish very deeply and they're trying to be funny and they're saying fucked up things that are totally ridiculous. He grows and a lot of them are saying it because it's just you and me and you and me and we'll just talk some shit.

Speaker 5:          01:56:52       Yeah. And I run a bus. Words are not action. And that's what people need. Understand if he died, there you go. Women voted higher rates than men. That might help Clinton in November. See what the numbers, yeah, there you go. But it doesn't say it has different numbers here. Okay. There's not an overall, yeah, no. So the idea though, that words are in action, so I'm not defending the grab them by the Pussy and blah, blah, blah. And he was sort of saying that he had done it in the past. So if, if there had been evidence that he had done those actions actually assaulted, which is no evidence unless you know a women's vaginas not made out of playdough. It's not like fingerprints that are permanent forever, you know, so that's fully legit. But you can't prosecute him for just saying. That's my point is that words he said some shit that was gross.

Speaker 5:          01:57:36       Right. But it might have been true. Yeah, true. So words and actions are two different things. Now maybe you can't prove those things cause yeah, they're not made out of play dough. But that's still until it's provable. You can't, you can get outraged by it. I see. I see your point with the problem is that just relying completely on the burden of evidence being like physical proof. You're dealing with an act of people touching each other's bodies and it's just, there's not a whole lot of proof when it comes to that. So I agree with that. But then what do you do and where does that put us? Because we know that some people when they, when they give a a rape allegation, you know, we know that there's gonna be a lot of people that are telling you the absolute truth as they remember it.

Speaker 5:          01:58:19       There's also going to be crazy people that make things up. There's going to be some spectrum in between those two things. Where are you going to have people that exaggerate situations that I'm sure you've had any conversations that you've had with people that maybe you've had a disagreement and they go to someone else and they completely reframed a disagreement, like you're a piece of shit. It's a common thing that people do. We love to do it and we love to do it for all kinds of things. And I've been guilty of it and I'm sure you have and everybody listening to this thing I'm sure as we are learning the very complicated game of communication with human beings and how much is involved in it, the ego and personality conflicts and where you are in your life and your own stresses and frustrations and whenever the fuck is going on, whatever is going on in this big struggle that we're all involved in, right?

Speaker 5:          01:59:00       W there's not always a very clear perception of how events went down. Yeah. So see you have to take that into consideration. You also have to take any consideration the fact they might be telling the truth. We do not know. So it's not that there's no evidence because there's people that are talking, it's just, it's nothing you can put on a scale and we don't know how to read minds yet. And the problem is if you read minds, man, right, I find some fucking memories of things. Then I went back and looked at them again like a video or something. And I'm like, wow, I didn't even know when to, they're like, we just went over that the other day I was talking about Tommy hearns versus Marvin Hagler. She's like, one of my all time favorite fights. I would have swore it was a second round knockout.

Speaker 5:          01:59:40       No, they went to a third round. Hagwon knocked him out in the third round. I'm like, how the fuck did it in my mind, I would have told you, I'll bet you $1,000. It was the second round and I was wrong. I remembered it. I remembered it wrong. There was moments in the fight with the fights playing out and this is something that doesn't have any attachment to me in my life. Obviously. I'm not like saying that someone's going to throw in memory. I'm not, especially someone who is involved in some sort of a violent crime where the victim, you know, I don't know because I think it's gotta be absolutely horrific and it's entirely possible that some people can go through an assault or a crime like that and remember everything. And then there's other people that cannot cause people that even black out horrible things because the memory is so disturbing to them that they have to, they, they blocked them out.

Speaker 5:          02:00:26       Especially molestations a lot of people go through that later in life when they realize like what they were trying to suppress. Your brain is like literally trying to save you from these memories because they're too fucking painful. So what it does is it buries them, I don't know how it works, they don't understand it, but this is real. Then people suddenly at 40 they go, wait a minute is a proven effect. It's a proven effect. So there's all these things that we need to take into consideration. I think there's also the very real cultural benefit of having our first woman president. I think culturally what I do, I just don't think that she's a good representative in terms of like her need for financial compensation for speeches and the Goldman Sachs connection and the connection to the Saudis. I also don't have a fucking clue as to what it's like to deal with foreign policy and foreign leaders.

Speaker 5:          02:01:13       And I don't know. I don't know if that's even a voidable but that's the thing. It's like, you know, people will say, well the, the she's in bed with the Saudis or something. Well guess what? The Saudis, whether we like it or not, who do horrific things and explored all kinds of Wahhabi Islam and real extremism and or bombing the shit out of Yemen and with our weapons and all kinds of stuff. Well she also took $1 million from Qatar. Qatar right now is using slave labor to build their World Cup stadium, which there may not even get the World Cup. So

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       it's like every, why did they give her $1 million? It's for something. You know what I mean? It's not for nothing. You don't give $1 million for no reason. So, but that again goes to like, we're seeing how all this shit is made right now. And the simple fact is if you're upset that she has a close relationship with the Saudis, then you got to hate Obama for it to where I think a lot of these people are letting that slide. I'm, I'm not even making a judgment call on it as much to say is this, there are things that are going on at extremely high levels for governments and that we just have to try to decipher some truth to it because we're not going to get another way. Saudi Arabia, women can't drive. They can barely go out without men. They are stuck in, as Bill Maher says, beekeeper costumes in the Burkas, right? I mean all of these things, well, how could they possibly be our ally if we're for women, if Barack Obama is for women, if Hillary Clinton is for women, how is Saudi Arabia one of our most stable allies that we give a ton of money too, if, if that's what it is.

Speaker 5:          02:02:33       The only thing that I would take into consideration is that if I was trying to figure this out as an outsider, I would see there's gotta be some benefit to keeping people like that connected to you and obligated to communicate with you and oils and your friend, but not just the oil. Also some other publishing, a non combative relationship with a very, very wealthy Middle East country that they're more could be done with honey than with vinegar. You know, this idea of being connected with those people, there might be some sort of a benefit because they're so alien to us and they're so dominant in their control over their environment. Like you look at these dictators in this foreign, these foreign countries that we supported for so many years and you can make the argument that they're horrible, absolutely terrible people that we should have nothing to do with.

Speaker 5:          02:03:22       You could also make the argument that that part of the world is so fucked up that you have to somehow or another maintain some sort of friendly connection to the people that are in power. And then that might be the best way to keep everybody safe. While we figured out a fucking strategy, how to deal with religious fundamentalist, crazy people that literally have trillions of dollars at their disposal to do anything they want from the Saudis. By yes, but not just from the Saudis. I mean there's a gigantic chunk of the Middle East that has so much money, it's incomprehensible and not everyone, just a few people, oligarchy, monarchs and these people that have looked at, in Abu Dhabi, they make it rain every week. They make it rain. Literally. They literally see the sky to do cloud seeding and they make it rain like it's the desert and they use their money to make it rain. Like not a strip club and you're not using one

Speaker 4:          02:04:12       is that wasn't hyperbole. It was actual real well, think about Egypt is the best example of what you're talking about because Egypt for 30 years had Mubarak, this was a guy, he was a military guy backed by the United States. Horrible on on a human rights and all that other stuff. But he kept control of the country, basically kept their borders, kept peace with Israel, basically kept things under control. I was in Egypt in 97 and it was pretty disgusting actually. Even go to the pyramids. It was the, the pollution was terrible. Uh, it was the people weren't friendly. Like I would love to go back. I have a friend there now who I, uh, who's a youtube or this Guy Joe, who probably will show his face. He's an atheist and a free thinker. Um, if I could ever get him to the United States, you should have me enter.

Speaker 4:          02:04:53       The guy's really, he's great. Freely and openly and Egypt. Sometimes he disappears for months and then the side, he doesn't really publicly say exactly what he's doing. But when I had him on the show, I said to him, you know, if you want to wear a spiderman mask, you don't have to show your face. You know, you do whatever you want. And he said, no, I want to show my face. So anyway, they had Mubarak for 30 years. He kept the Muslim Brotherhood. They were illegal under the time. Then they have the Tahrir Square, a revolution. What happens? They, we deposed, we partly, they depose Mubarak, they get the Muslim Brotherhood through democracy, and then a year later they realize these guys are way worse. So what they got from democracy was way worse. So then what happens? The military then steps in and then has a coup overthrows the democracy. And now they have a military leader again, United States the entire time to support it. All of that. So it's like, this is the problem with democracy. And we know this from Iraq too. It's like you can give democracy, but if the institutions aren't there ready to support it, you could get a lot of bad people then. And then it's over like what the Hell's going on? And you mentioned Bengazi before we got rid of Qaddafi who was obviously a bad dude. You have any idea what kind of government there isn't it

Speaker 2:          02:06:04       fear right now? Nobody knows is a scary state. That's a state of chaos, right? So it was a state, but you're more aware of uh, Amber Lyon and a amber Lyon when she was working for CNN and she did a piece on bowel rain. No notice I said bow rain like an American, not Bahrain Lane. Um, thank you for dumbing that down for me. It's not that I just don't want to be pretentious and puts born to check what Obama says. Bucky stun Pakistan. Yeah. Or Latinos or Latinos.

Speaker 4:          02:06:35       Well now you have to say Latin ex so that you're not, it's not Latino's that implies men or Latino women. Now you say Latin X. Cause if you're a fucking,

Speaker 2:          02:06:43       why don't we call ourselves to Max? I said a humanz genetics. I like it. I'm know. Humanics that sounds dope. Yeah. Um, what, what kind of species are there? Humanics yeah, sounds like male, female and female. Who? Max. Whew, man. Right. It's so rude. It's rude. Why not you? Whoa man, man. When history, what about her story? I mean, come on Joe. Yeah, man. What about her story? So amber lions, because of her stories, she does this, um, investigative piece on Bahrain and a CNN completely turns it into like a vacation and tourism commercial and they cut out all the bad stuff aired it. And uh, I don't remember if she did. Jamie, do you remember she got fired if she went up resigning, do you remember anyway? Um, that sounds like a resigning. It was. I don't if she was fired. If she resigned.

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       Yeah. I'm sorry. I don't remember. But the point is, she came on my podcast, she wrote a book. Um, and um, she sort of explained like what, what would really go on when you tried to put together these pieces and you know, in, in, in defense of CNN, they, I know they had a rebuttal to what she said and they disagreed with her, her framing of it, her memory of it, you know, I don't know, but it sounds to me like whatever stuff that she found that was very questionable did not make the air. And that's probably why. I mean there was the CIA's talked pretty openly about having people that work in different news organizations where they sort of framed the news. Yeah. Well look, that goes to everything we've been talking about this, it all seems to be coming back to this idea of the online world and the old school thing, they're like starting to have parody now where what we're doing is as an influential, you, Joe Rogan is more influential than anybody on CNN in reality.

Speaker 2:          02:08:32       In the reality of, yeah, but not a Fox News. That man, she, Megan Kelly, so hot. If you weren't gay, Dude, do you understand? Still do it well, it's still doing so hot. She is. She's so something violent about her. God Damn. Something violent like masculine. Like you would think of her as a man. So she, I feel like she has a big Dick. Wow. Isn't it her brain though? It's in her breakdown. Externalizes oh yeah. You know they're trying to give her $20 million and she hasn't accepted yet or you go girl, get that 40 you get 40 it's fucking worth it. The networks useless without you wherever she goes. I'm watching. Isn't that crazy though? I mean, think about it like 20 million bucks. Skipped perfect cheeks. She does. She does. She deserves it. She's very good talk. She's good man. She's very eloquent. Did you see that thing that you went, went at it with Newt Gingrich?

Speaker 2:          02:09:21       Newt Gingrich is a fucker, isn't he? He's, you know, I have a little bit of a love hate thing with them cause I do the, he's really smart. He's very smart guy. He's really smart. He understands. Like when I talked before about like knowing what the role of government is and all that stuff that we should know more about in civics and all that. Like that guy gets it in and out and whether you agree with his politics or not, he did do some stuff with the contract with America to with America to, you know, move the country in a certain way. I'm actually surprised he hasn't run for president. Well he ran four years ago and they basically remember at that point when it's right. That was the whole thing with his wife and he left, his wife was sick and had another bra. In a weird way he was the precursor to trump because you remembered that during those primaries he would be, you know, he was really good with zingers and with some comedy and he would get the audience to applaud and cheer and boo talking about the media, the media and they boo and hiss and then suddenly the moderators started saying every time there'll be no booing or applauding or, and it's like sit there like a fucking robot.

Speaker 2:          02:10:20       It's 1984 and eight press here. Just stay. That's American. It's American. They do it now in the debates door. There'll be silence. You know? It's like, cause she'd be in jail. Remember that? Yeah. Oh, you'd be in jail cause it should be in jail. That was in my mind, the best bomb ever dropped on a presidential debate next to I knew Jack Kennedy. You're no jacket. Remember that? Against Dan Quayle. We don't even remember who the other dude is. Lloyd Benson. Lloyd Benson. Yeah. Yeah, man. Politics. That seems like something else. You talked about parallel universe. It doesn't that I watched, this is going to sound, this is going to be corny as hell, but about two weeks ago I was sitting a Saturday. If you're going, I'm just flipping the channels. Cspan comes on and they're replaying the 1992 debate between George Hw Bush. Bill Clinton running for the first time and Perot and I watched about a half hour of it, I think three o'clock on a Saturday and he really was like being in an alternate universe.

Speaker 2:          02:11:16       It felt so different. They were actually talking about economics or Ross Perot with is try and I'm going to do this and we don't know. You're kind of me and Wilma and bill. Good. Oh I do. And it was like wow. There was actual, it was about politics. Maybe it was completely fucked up. Maybe it was all bullshit and lies and all that stuff, but it was about politics and that was only, what is that? That's 20 years ago basically. Yeah. This is a different era. This is the reality TV show air. You know, I used to have this joke that I never figured out how to get to work, but it's sort of just an observation that there's so many people with shows where there's just a pr like this is like when Jersey shore was around, like we're going to have a show one day where it's going to be a reality show about a reality camera man.

Speaker 2:          02:11:57       And then we're going, why? We're going to follow that guy around as he goes to all these exotic places and films, these people getting drunk on the beach. And then one day we're going to want to know who's the man behind the camera, behind the man behind the camera and then we're going to follow that guy around. He's going to get a reality show is going to be a reality show about a camera man who's on a reality show about a camera man who's a reality. Show. Cameramen deeper and deeper and deeper until the whole world is filled with people on a reality show while they're holding up a camera like two mirrors facing themselves with infinite camera man in each direction. That's what we have right now. I mean there's some good weed. Well this is what we have though is good, but that's a, it's an old bit that I never figured out how to get to work, but the point being is like this is what we're experiencing.

Speaker 2:          02:12:40       This is what we're experiencing with phones. Like it's, it might not be on a network on a bravo coming up next at eight it's Mike the camera man on a reality show. It doesn't have to be by a network. It is what you're having with something like periscope. It is what you're having when people are alive, facebook streaming from, you know, amusement parks or whatever the fuck they're doing. It's a reality show. How do you, how do you blend, how much of your Joe Rogan, actual human versus Joe Rogan, the public person, how do you, where do you put that line in terms of periscoping from home or showing I don't do this stuff because they're not public. People know my wife and kids aren't public people. Yeah. They don't want to be, they're just regular people. Just because they know me, it doesn't mean I should drag them into this nonsense.

Speaker 2:          02:13:24       I just think all of us could do better with a little less interaction digitally. I think it's happening so fast that, you know, like we're talking about people at restaurants that are constantly on their phone and when you check them on it, they get upset. I've been upset. People telling me to put my phone down, I'm like, I got to do this. Yeah, it's normal. It's natural reaction. I think we have, I think, um, all of us are going to eventually though step into that great divide and the future is going to be everybody all the time connected to everybody all the time. And it's going to be very weird. It's going to change thought. I think it's going to, I think we really are going to become like some sort of a bizarre hive mind. Well they do. They've done studies where the Internet already, when they look at Internet addicts that they find that the, the wiring in their brain actually has changed. It's changed certain synapse. It's actually caused like membranes to shrink into all kinds of stuff. Last, uh, I think it was may I for eight days and I never, I'd never take off. I don't remember the last time I took like some actual time of, I took eight days off, went to Mexico. I locked my phone in a safe, whoa. We're actually, my husband did it lock the phone in the safe. I did not know the code word for eight days. I sat on a beach. It was at like an Olympian.

Speaker 2:          02:14:41       It was like a digital moderately, the dirtiest thing we've ever done. Do you want that phone? It was really, it was why. Um, but for eight days I had no phone and I kid you not, I mean I felt my brain kind of resetting. I felt some things happening and also I felt more, I felt more patient. I felt like, you know, in conversations where, you know, not like this, but where you're constantly just distracted by every little thing. Like I got away from it and then when I got back on the grid, you know, because immediately the second I got off the plane and I was, you know, doing my thing, I realize, wow, you know, the world went on and it was all right. It was actually okay. Yeah. I missed some shit. Something, something happened on my show that took, that got a lot of news.

Speaker 2:          02:15:21       I didn't know about it for eight days, but like, yeah, it was just like some shit happened. Yeah. I, I mean, like I said, I'm not trying to judge people who are using these things, using these devices. I'm just trying to talk about it as honestly as I can because I think it's almost inevitable. But I think for your own personal good, it has to be managed carefully. I think you have to take audit of all the stuff that's in your life. And if you spend like I have an hour and a half just reading through tweets about like almost nothing and just looking for something interesting. Just constantly scrolling, looking for something interesting. Like step away from that thing. Cause you're, you're impulsively or me speaking to me, talking to me impulsively checking images on instagram. What Cool Shit did people post up? You know what interesting. And my main news is out there right now, but you know what is uh, the, the latest trending topics on twitter? Yeah. After a while. Like what the fuck am I doing? What, how about my life? What about me as a person? Like what am I doing? I'm not even paying attention. Yeah. Well that's why I framed it like that between Joe Rogan, the public person, and then actually the human that has to go ahead and live and do this operation. And kids and a wife

Speaker 5:          02:16:30       and all those things. Those are two separate things. And yet you got to bring them somehow into harmony so that they can exist together. A big ones. Meditation, thinking, Meditation and thinking about what you actually want to do versus what your momentum is leading you towards. And for me it's isolation tanks. That's the big one. You know, I have one of my patients, I use it all the time. I think about things. They're in an undistracted way and I take an evaluation of like how I'm thinking and I, it was always like it. And that's one of the things that people don't like about getting high. And it's one of the things that people don't like about isolation tanks and or yoga class too. It was talking with my yoga instructor the other day and you know, she was saying it forces people to examine their shit.

Speaker 5:          02:17:12       It does, it forces you to look at your stuff when you're struggling, you know? And Yoga seems so easy when you just say the word. It seems like something, Oh, you're just grabbing your feet and you know, it's fucking hard. Man, it's hard and everyone was 104 degrees. Speaking of fucked up, did you see that? Uh, Hbo, real sports things with that be from guy. They interviewed beak from Yoga, got holy Shit. People are, they're taking their name, his name off the yoga studio now he's killing people. No, no, no, no. He's just a like a crazy fuck. Who was saying that all these women you know have lied because he's been accused of sexual assault and that people pay $1 million for one drop of his sperm. He's like one drop of my sperm. $1 million.

Speaker 5:          02:17:56       I mean he's, he's a guru, right? Yeah. He's uses Yoga Guru who's responsible for, it's one. It's really an excellent sort of an analogy to how weird and fucked up human beings are that we are not perfect in any way, shape or form. You have this guy who brought this thing its beak from yoga to America and he didn't create it. It's been around for thousands of years and he tried to sue people for the patent and all the movements he lost. He there was like, you can't pat in Yoga, but this guy has brought yoga and, and sort of promoted yoga too. Who knows how many millions of people. He's like one of the most directly responsible people for promoting this stuff. But then you see him as a person, he's a crazy fuck. He won't let people go to the bathroom. You have to sit there and listen to them talk and if you have to go, you're going to go in your pants.

Speaker 5:          02:18:44       Like it's all like cult shit. It makes them stay up all night and watch bollywood movies. It's like a fuck you. He's a crazy man. He's got rolls royces and shit. And they busted him with all these cars and he said that he was gonna open up a school for children to learn automobiles. Oh yeah. That's why I bought these Rolls Royces. It's a school for underprivileged children with Rolls Royce. It's amazing. It's amazing. But I think, but that goes to the worship thing that we were talking about and that's like when we see these people worshiping Hillary or worshiping trump and it's like they are not going to solve all your problems and not only are they not going to stop weapons, they shouldn't. The president should. The president should keep the road safe. The president should make sure nobody bombs us. The president should make sure the economy keeps chugging. Just think about the shit jobs that you just

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       said. How does one person have those three important jobs? It's fucking crazy. You get a guy for the roads. If it's ridiculous, you get the department or something. I call him, hey man, you're doing a job. Yeah, got to go check these roads working sly in Arizona. Let me see the road. But the road, but that's actually, that's actually the point. Like they're not supposed to be our guide. They're not supposed to be our emperor. They're supposed to keep the ship afloat, but as human beings, we want champs. We want it. God. We want. Yeah. We want to bring jfk back to life when a clone them and even him, he would never survive today. All the crazy shit that guy was up to. That's the point. It's like he would have made wiener looked like a Catholic school gave him or that's Graham gram account.

Speaker 3:          02:20:12       I think there's so many people like that that are complicated. They're not that we have this narrative that's been created by film and buy books. We have this false narrative of this perfect human being. This John Wayne care two rides off into the sunset, this clint eastwood who are, you know, Sondra Locke has always waving goodbye to him. He's your rides off and away from the Indian. It's like this is all a false narrative and it's created in such a potent way that our brains are stained by that and we kind of expect that out of our leaders instead of, I think that's not the case in other countries, like in Europe in particular, right? In Europe, like in France, like politicians dare fucking affairs and shit. Nabisco running a brothel or something, you know, like, hey, we're having, it's Italy. Italy is another example. It's a different world.

Speaker 3:          02:20:58       I mean we've developed a very strange culture over here in America. Very strange and and, and a lot of ways confused culture both in the positive and in the negative, you know, and bolt and the condemnation of things that people like trump have said or you know, people like Clinton have allegedly done. And also our reaction to it, both of them were, we're weird. We're just fucking weird man. And I don't, I don't think we've really fully embraced our weirdness as a species yet. I think that's part of the problem with being a president in the first place. It's based on bullshit. Like it's, it's based on the idea that you can give people power and they won't abuse it because of an ancient scroll. That's really what it is. Someone, many, many moons ago before electricity, they figured out how to make anc of like bugs and shit.

Speaker 3:          02:21:48       Whether you use charcoal, the fuck they used to make any, I was going to buy the bugs. That seems sensible. They dip their quill into that and they would write on a scroll, which by the way, it was mostly made out of hemp. Most of these hemp paper. Well look, everyone is incredibly complex and it has to do with we're all flawed. We all fail every day and succeed at other things. You could look at, look at Thomas Jefferson. I was at, my cousin got married near Monte Cello in Virginia where, and that's, you know, that's where his house was and everything where he, uh, where he lived and owned slaves and had sex with some of the slaves and one of the slaves had sex with several of them. I think he was having a good time. Yeah, he did. But think about that. He was writing the very, that ultimately

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       freed the slaves while at the same time in effect, you could argue, and I'm sure people have argued this, that he was raping a slave because if it is about power, even if she was fully down with it, she was his slave. So, so, but at the same time he was also a writing the very laws to free them. That shows you how, how flawed all of us are that you could hate, you could hate him for, for owning slaves. You could hate him for having this relationship with this woman and all that. And at the same time he was instrumental in writing the very laws that made us all equal. So that goes and you could, that's why it's so dangerous when you look back on a different time and you try to apply our morality of today on other people. It's on other times.

Speaker 4:          02:23:11       It's so dangerous because you could look at him and go, fuck that guy. Let's, let's erase every bit of history the way we did with the dukes of hazzard car and all that shit. And it, that's crazy. It's a thing that existed. Confederate flags go back to generally gets you to the generally, yeah. I just think it should be on the car and TV. Land shouldn't have taken the show off the air. You know what I mean? Like Bill Cosby, I told you this last time I was here. Like that guy was my hero. I went into comedy because I was five years old and I saw bill cosby himself when he's talking about chocolate cake and Theo and Vanessa, the whole thing. And I thought it was the funniest fucking thing ever and it changed my life. It changed the course of my life. Now my childhood hero is the biggest serial rapist of all time.

Speaker 4:          02:23:51       Of all time. Yeah. That's depressing. Yeah. That's another great example. Holy should really think about what goodness, you could absolutely draw a line between bill cosby and Barack Obama. You can clearly draw a line that if bill cosby and that shows they're both black. So there you go. No, but you could draw a line to say that if that show had not been on NBC primetime in had he not done that, that middle class upstanding family. But that was incredibly funny and all the great stuff about cosby that that led to eventually 20 some odd years later, Barack Obama being president and, and at the same time he was a horrific rapist. Do you think that like a lot of his morality, and this goes back to the sort of tied thing, slingshot effect, that a lot of his sort of projected morality was to make up for the fact that it was drug and chicks and rape.

Speaker 4:          02:24:39       And I'm so he was America's Dad. Right. And he was also like the ups down upstanding citizen for the black community to get upset if comedians would swear that whole thing with Eddie Murphy. Yeah. I mean, and not just him or not just uh, Eddie Murphy. But I believe the same with Dave Chappelle. I think he had a problem with Chris Rock. You know what he, what he stood for as was like this really conservative, really friendly, you know, don't we don't talk about Dick's and pussies and all that stuff. Like he had a whole thing about like when he was really old to before he got caught, it was a whole thing about w w talk about it, but we don't hit it. We don't hit on it. W W we know what I'm saying. Can every comedian do

Speaker 3:          02:25:23       a cause we can't even that impressive. And probably the only time I've ever tried it, but it's pretty decent. Thank you. Yeah, I need it needs work. Let's be honest. But the point being is that this guy was the most vocal. Yeah. You'd never heard of the common, like you never heard George Wallace tell other comedians what they should do. You know, you never hear that from Paul, you know, Paul Mooney maybe. But there's, you know what I'm saying? Like it's like you don't, well, I guess partly partly that may have been because cosby became such a big institution. You know what I mean? It wasn't like, I love both those guys, especially George Wallace, I think is like absolutely hilarious, but he never got the level of mainstream success where what he says has some sort of cultural significance right. Within the comedy world. Cosby got to the place of it.

Speaker 3:          02:26:09       It's something else. It's beyond, it's beyond what, 99.9, nine, nine, 9% of comics or any public figure actually gets, he gets a place in the scheme of history, so, well, yeah, it's different. He was, uh, he was the best example of like the elevated person from this minority. Like the best example, very well spoken. He got a doctorate. I can't think it got a kind of a legit one or you got an honorary one? I pretty sure it was legit. One was like from a paper that he had to write and graduate school or something like that. See if you, I think you got a legit one from New Jersey. He's actually an h cosby. Write that out to me. Yeah. But I mean you can get an honorary doctorate just for your humanitarian work or cause people think you're slick. Well, heath cliff huxtable was a ob Gyn, so there you go.

Speaker 3:          02:26:58       It must've went to school there. I must have. Yeah. Um, I think that you see, you grab her by the Pussy, but you'd give her a drink first. Trump. See now if you went to run for president, they go back to that. They'd take that out of context and I go, what the fuck did that caused me worshiping pussy grabbing. You'll see. But it isn't it. Here it goes. Is this is sometimes referred to as doctor Cosby. He has his doctorate in education from the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. He earned the degree in the mid 1970s a thesis entitled the Integration of Visual Media via fat Albert and the Cosby kids. That's what I did my doctorate on. How weird. Okay. It's a teaching aide and vehicle to achieve increased learning. That's interesting. So, so that goes to your point, did a, was the public person really just defending the horrible actions of the private person, but also he clearly was trying to do good work, but here it says, but how he got his degree has been controversial ever since. According to Michael Eric Dyson, a sociology professor at Georgetown University and acclaimed author of his Bill Cosby, right. And numerous other books. Cosby dropped out of high school after he flunked his 10th grade three times. He enlisted in the navy where he got his ged. They enrolled at temple where he dropped out to pursue a show business career is unfinished. Bachelor degree from Temple was eventually it bestowed upon him because of his life experience. Cosby enrolled in a part time doctoral student as the University of Massachusetts Amherst,

Speaker 5:          02:28:22       which awarded home. See? So that's it. So he dropped out of high school, came back, got his ged enrolled in temple, dropped out of that and got a doctorate for writing about a cartoon. But even the bachelor's degree, they're saying he had an unfinished bachelor's degree because of life experience. So he didn't get that degree reality. Wow, that's wild. So both of them. So it's not entirely true. I mean, he did get a degree, but obviously there's a, there's an asterick attached to that. Yeah. But, but separating it from that, it's like that, that thing that you're talking about is, is pretty powerful stuff. That what you, that he was doing this horrible shit until and yet. And yet he enriched so many lives at the same time, literally at the same time that he was doing this horrible stuff to these women. He was bringing so much goodness to the country.

Speaker 5:          02:29:08       That's, that's deep. You know, there's fucking deep and that's people. No, I think the sooner we recognize how flawed human beings are, the the better we're going to be off. And I think also on a, this is another thing that I've talked about on stage before, but it's a real issue. I don't think human beings are designed to take in the data for media. I don't think we can truly distinguish the difference between false narratives and fiction. I mean, I know we can, you know, when you go to see a fucking movie, you know it's a movie you leave. Lao is a good movie man. God Damn, can't wait for doctor. Strange to, you know, we know it's a movie, but there's an impact that that data has on our mind that we have to, even though we have to separate it and move it around, that impact is there were designed to follow like the tribal leader, this old guy with scars who's fucking survived battles and he has wisdom and he knows the poems and we sit around the fire and we follow him because of actual real live accomplishments in real life.

Speaker 5:          02:30:08       Things that we've seen him do. And it's how he stays alive is I stay alive. Whereas only 30 of us. Okay, we've got fucking bear skins on and we're living in a cave and we, we don't have much time. We got to follow that guy. He knows how to stay alive and we might not make it. And this is a very real concern because we know tribes that are gone, right? So this is how human beings develop for fucking thousands of thousands of years. If you believe in evolution, when we went from being a monkey to being a guy who's addicted to a cell phone, there was a lot of steps along the way. And in those steps we developed a lot of these human reward systems where you get you, you get used to and look forward to certain things was those things, those rewards will keep you alive.

Speaker 5:          02:30:49       Whether it's being attractive to females, the will spread your DNA. That when you must be concerned about this, whether it's a overcoming the adversaries, because if you don't, they're going to kill you. Like you have to stay alive. You gotta be, you have to figure out how to stay quiet when you're hunting is one of the reasons today why women enjoy gossip and men enjoy quiet and why the two are sometimes incompatible. Like there's a design, women are designed, they were trying to keep the fucking tribe together so that sit around washing clothes. She got this dirty bitch fucks everybody when we go to sleep. Like that's, that's

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       where it came from. Yeah. And with the men they were out of these hunting parties and like shy, everybody shut the fuck up. What's pay attention? We gotta be, we gotta stay close here. And this is the whole reason why there's a difference in the way these to behave. And this has all been like well established by sociologists, by people who have studied human behavior. I think that where we're at now with movies and songs, you're getting this data in a way. We don't know how to process. We obviously internally, you know, we obviously can rationalize and go, well I know that's just a song. Or I know that's just a movie. And I know the Indiana Jones isn't a real guy and he wouldn't just survive every time the fucking bowling ball size boulder comes his way. He would, he would get killed. Then he got in the fridge and parked for you to fucking Ark of the covenant.

Speaker 3:          02:32:04       How do you survive the, come on man. There's a lot of shit going on in that. I could accept that the fucking news goes to be apocalyptic. All of it. It's supposed to be replacing the dark. Yeah. The way it looked the other way from the nuke. That's all he needed to do. Kidney Cancer. He's got a fucking cool hat. But those, those narratives and this, this life version is all data that's entered into the human consciousness. And the more we expose ourselves to it, when kids are watching eight hours of fucking television and uh, people were like constantly and gross in their phones and all this like two dimensional data and video and all these different things on youtube, the more that stuff gets into your mind, into your life, the less you're experiencing the actual life. It's almost like a preparation for us being a part of this hive mind.

Speaker 3:          02:32:48       Like these are the steps you take when you create this sort of new type of being. I mean, it's integrated. You're, you're talking about the matrix that we're, we're slowly morphing into this thing. And that's why, you know, people have to understand that what happens there isn't real yet. So like, you know, sorta jumping all the way back to that, Leslie, don't think it, when people say mean things to you, I'm sure if you would look at your twitter right now, somebody is probably saying something mean they will now how they're going to be really pissed. You're a bully. You told them to do it. You see you, you've sick. Don't worry. There's a lot of mine are you already? So they'll, they'll turn it on me door. We're all fine. But uh, but point is that, that those words, it goes to that words are not acting thing like it.

Speaker 3:          02:33:28       So what someone said something mean to you, you got to get over it. So, for example, part of my, uh, this is gonna sound sort of Corny, but part of my success in the last year is directly related to you because your name, because my show is my, for real, my show was taken off when I was on here last time. And by you giving it a little bump here and then you've been, you've been real good to me on social media. You helped amplify what I do. And in the process of that, I now all my social media, when I scroll in a weird way, it's become sort of meaningless. It's become all noise because if 95% of its good, which it usually is low, then it's like, oh there's another nice one. It's nice and it is nice, you know, I'm not demeaning and people giving you compliments just a nice things or I like what you're doing or retweeting what I'm doing or whatever.

Speaker 3:          02:34:11       That's all nice. And then the bad ones come in and then, you know, for whatever reason I focus on the bad ones more. But then I just let it all becomes noise and I'm just like, you know what? I just have to do what I do and then let the rest of it be I, you know what I mean? We probably at this point can't respond to everybody anymore. Oh No, I can't. No, it's it. But that's the thing. It's not fun anymore. Like part of the, the price to pay for a little success here is that the part that used to be fun when I would play around with people more on there and spend more time interacting. It's like, it's become such like a cal vacate of craziness that I, I just don't have the time where I didn't have the mental bandwidth more than anything else.

Speaker 3:          02:34:47       I have a lot going on and it's like, so that's been a little bit of a sacrifice along the way. But yeah, but that's just comes with the program. Especially when you're thinking about the numbers of people that you're reaching. Nobody ever had to do that. Like madmen magic. Johnny Carson had a twitter account and he was trying to interact with all the fans where he got email carson tonight, show.com and he's like, did not know that there's, look at all those fucking email. How am I gonna respond to these people? If you don't, they get mad at you. They were, but this one good thing that's going on is people don't expect you to do that when you reach a certain number of fans. Like I get way more, um, messages from people that say, Hey, I love the podcast or a great job in the UFC, or something like that.

Speaker 3:          02:35:25       That those kind of messages I get way more often than someone actually trying to get me to respond to things I would like to do if I had, I had that kind of time, but no one has that kind of time. Right. That's what I'm saying. There's just a certain amount and that goes to combining public person and private person. Like there's a certain amount of bandwidth that your brain has that all of us have to do what, whatever it is we do. I could, we, the two of us could sit here for 24 hours in a row and just respond to things and blah, blah blah. And it's like your brain also has to be able to breathe well. Your spirit has to be able to breathe, you have to live life. And I think if you have anything to offer, and this one of the things that I'm finding, it's kind of important to me and I've tried to, I've tried to engineer this in my own life in a way, is that I've got to have as much life experiences or more than I do work because like just working.

Speaker 3:          02:36:15       Like if I just did podcasts every day, I would have things to say because there's always something going on in the world. But I think I wouldn't be doing my own perspective, a service I think to do my perspective of serve it, to, to be honest about it. I need to experience things. I needed to live life. I needed to, uh, you know, travel to places. Yeah. I needed to do things that are difficult and I need to get involved in a lot of activities. I like to do different things because I think first of all, because I enjoy them first and foremost. And I think embracing that I enjoy them benefits me and a great way to, yeah. Because when I do things that I enjoy it, I get happy. When I get happy, I work better, you know? And I think if, if I didn't do that and if I didn't like actively seek out, it would just, it's really easy for a lot of people. A lot of people find this, they get caught up in work so much that that's all they focus on. And then, then I think you stop being the person who got to that position in the first place. The person who got to that position in the first place got there because people liked what you talked about, what you thought

Speaker 4:          02:37:16       about. And then the only way that even gets more enhanced is by experiencing things. And by the way, you don't have to go to, uh, across the world to do that. Even, I was telling you before we started that. So I just, I bought a house. We're, we're doing the home studio thing. My fans are funding it. It's like my dreams literally are becoming reality. It's as you know, like Dez validating as anything that has happened in my entire life. Congratulations. Yes. That's awesome. It's like, it's beautiful. Yeah, it's very cool too man. It's awesome. Um, and yesterday I'm trying to hook up some speakers in the house and I have some old ass stereo that I've had forever and I'm trying to hook this shit up and it was driving me crazy, but I actually halfway through after like three hours of fucking pulling things out of the wall and you know, the old wire is the little metal ones that you've got to turn and jamming them into speakers and negative a twist and the black thing.

Speaker 4:          02:38:04       And I'm jamming. I mean that's literally what I'm doing yesterday and I'm frustrated as fuck. And then about halfway through I was like, this is actually great. My attention was so focused, turning those things, getting that thing in there, pulling one out. Wait a minute, I had to run across the other and make the speaker work and this one I have to run outside and it's like, that was actually great. It was a moment completely where I set all my shit aside and I realized I was like, wow, for the last hour I was fucking in this shitty ass Yamaha Stereo thing, you know? And it was actually pretty great, right? Yeah. There really is. So you don't have to go across the world to do it. Just doing something that there was meaning in me doing it. I didn't want to hire someone to do it. You know, like I want to figure this thing out.

Speaker 4:          02:38:48       And I did. I think there's definitely something to that. But I went to the Vatican this summer and I think it was more fun than you install on your stereo and I got to learn more about people and looking at, you know, St Peter's basilica than I ever would've done screwing together some fucking wires and sticking them into some box that makes noise. I Bet I can beat you on that because many years ago, I believe around 97, I think it might have been the same trip that I ended up in Egypt. I went to Amsterdam. I like basically shrooms for like eight days and then we want it. So my buddy and I, we wanted to take that, we wanted to take shrooms to, uh, to Rome to trip at the Sistine Chapel. So listen to this, we get on the train, you know, it's like the overnight train, I don't know, probably 12 hours to go from Amsterdam to Rome.

Speaker 4:          02:39:32       We got boarded, the train got boarded by like, uh, I dunno, like blush or police or something. Yeah, something. So we were like, what are we gonna do? What do we do? So we ate the evidence. So we literally ate the shrooms on the trains. I don't remember like enough for one person each, like, not, not like a crazy amount, but we're on an overnight train in like one of those little cruise ships where you're sleeping with two people above you. So we're both on the bottom in a tiny little room with, with four Italians tripping balls for hours and hours and hours. We get to, we get to room and we went right to the Sistine Chapel, which you have to walk through like a lot of other chapels kind of to get to. And he said, but so I wasn't fully tripping but I had just enough, just enough in the Sistine Chapel beat that. Now you can't

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       pretty good. Well you only thing where you could do that through four countries cause I tripped through uh, the Netherlands. I tripped through bolt, Belgium, uh, something in Italy. There's, there's another one in there. What else would be in there? I Dunno. I mean it all sounds Florence, did you go to Florence? I went to Florence, but that's in Italy. Yeah. You said something else in Italy. So he was, he just, it was Belgium. Netherlands is where I started with things other than Italy. Is that what you meant? I don't know what I said. I don't know, but good time. That's the point. Like we, you, we visualizing just, you know, when you have just enough of the visuals, like just, it's like a little moving, you know, just a little something. I was stone cold sober inside St Peter's Basilica and I freaked out.

Speaker 2:          02:40:56       I was just thinking about the sheer effort involved in making something so insanely huge and how many hundreds of years it took to build it. We had a great guide. He was really smart. He was a professor and uh, he spoke fluent English and fluent Italian and he was a local professor who did this on the side. And when someone was like really enthusiastic about the history of it, he like lit up like a Christmas tree. So me and this guy had some awesome conversations and you know, you, he stuck with us for like our like five or six hours. Then we went to dinner with him afterwards and um, you know, he was just so, he sold love the artwork and the culture and the history of it. And it was like, it was so infectious when he was talking about it. Well, that's the thing.

Speaker 2:          02:41:39       You don't have to be religious per se. I'm not a believer. Doesn't matter. Right? I believe in things that I, that can be proven. If someone could prove something to me then, then I would believe it. If you told me that Lebron James dunked from half court, well I'd need to see video. You know, like I would just, Oh, he did well, hot damn, you know, so why wouldn't I apply that same logic to the biggest questions of the universe? But even not being a believer, you can acknowledge that the work that these people had to do, that maybe they felt some divine spirit, they felt something in themselves that I can't explain or whatever. That there's an incredible power to that. I mean, go to Jerusalem. You can look at the, the Western Wall is literally, you know, the holiest site in Judaism is adjacent with the Temple Mount.

Speaker 2:          02:42:18       The Dome of the Rock is right on top of that. The third holy site and Islam. And if you walk five minutes the other way, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre where Jesus was crucified is right there. I mean, so whether you believe in this stuff or not, it the fact the facts on the ground exist and you have to acknowledge that some people find meaning and value in that. And we could, we could argue whether that would have been a destructive force throughout time or I think a lot of ways religion is like bill cosby. It's both. It's helped people and it's hurt a lot. I mean, religion is, or been responsible for some horrible trustees and not just one religion, like many, many religions, but like many, many groups of power, many groups that have influencing great influence over people. A lot of times they look out for themselves, they protect themselves ruthlessly, especially when they have massive amounts of power. That doesn't make any sense in the world. Like when you look at any sort of, uh,

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       any side of a coup or any sort of a usurping of power, like it's someone who has massive amounts of power and someone else wants that massive amounts of power and they conquer him and takeover and it's always like this spectacular, chaotic event. And that's what human beings sort of, that's what they do. You know, they, they established positions of power than the abused them and they're almost begging for some better, smarter person to come along and take it from there. I think about that sometimes even when I'd be like walking where I used to live in west Hollywood where it's like pretty, uh, you know, it's next to beverly hills, it's a nice area and that all these people are sort of walking, you know, there's nice shops there and everyone kind of looks good. So it's sort of where he's at. But when they go to the gym, they tan, they get surgery, they're, they're like, they're all working on themselves all day doing their own thing and it's, and you're right, it's almost like they're just, they're so blind to the fact that there is something else happening.

Speaker 3:          02:44:06       There is a real power play happening in the world where there are forces that want to change things, either for what may be better for you or, or worst for you or whatever. And most people just ignore it because it's a lot easier to get lost in twitter or watch the Kardashians or country clubs, the kids of the world. That's what we are. We're just spoiled country club kids. The world that don't realize the consequences of flying drones in the Yemen and bombing wedding parties, you know, there's like the, the consequence that's attached to those people. It would be so significant it was happening on this patch of dirt, but since it's happening over there, we don't think of it as a big a deal. Could you imagine what would happen if someone from another country had flown a drone over the United States and accidentally bombed some sort of a wedding party in Phoenix?

Speaker 3:          02:44:51       Right. Could you fucking imagine, imagine if a one rocket flew over Mexicans, Mexico's border to a hotel, Passover, a La Jolla. We bomb Canada. I mean like that. Like think about that. Like it's so crazy when you think, you know, and I get it. As I said before, I'm not against every state secret. I understand that some shit has, there are rules that are beyond what the average time of day. They're only that way because there's no transparency in these other countries too. Yeah. Once all these countries develop this new level of transparency where you can't hide shit, you can't lie. You're going to do one or two things. You're going to say, look, I'm Gaviscon, I'm running this motherfucker and you're going to put in the whole thing. I mean, what Putin is doing right now is old school dictators kills his rivals publicly. He has sat, has Sasa natives, right?

Speaker 3:          02:45:42       Did you see the fucking assassination attempt on him? No. You haven't seen it? I don't think so. On on Putin? Yeah. No. Yeah, some wise that it made a suicide attack on his car, but his driver was in the car and not him. This guy drove high speed head on right into Putin's car. When we try this, how the hell did I miss two weeks ago? No Shit. Yeah, two weeks ago. Check out this. That takes a lot at seafood. Watch this, watch this, watch this car. See the guy in the middle is doing that so he could hit Putin's caught, Bam. That's

Speaker 5:          02:46:10       it. He knew where the car was and he drove in the median and then turn towards Putin's car. We tried to tell him one more time real quick, now that I can see it right now I see the front part to watch the median. What's the middle strip? That guy is, they're planning this. Then he sees the car and turns right into a holy shit. Holy Shit is right. It killed the driver. I think it killed both guys. See if we kill both guys, but Putin was not in that car, but that's his, um, his favorite driver. Fucking bananas. So I mean that's, that's game of thrones. That's right. That's to the point. This is very modern game of thrones happening. Yeah. And, but all these other people, these are the people that are protected by the dark lords that run the kingdom and that this is just the modern version of shit that's been going on since the beginning of time.

Speaker 5:          02:46:56       So then that said, does that give you any empathy for what Clinton has to do to get there? So that's what I'm saying. I don't have, not necessarily empathy, but a vague understanding of how ignorant I am about how the world works. And that's a, it's a weird place to sit, I suppose. And you know, here's the defense of Clinton, the major Clinton dot bill because, you know, not a defense of whatever he may or may not have done, uh, physically to all those people that are accusing him of things, but about his, like the speeches that he does and all the money that he's trying to acquire. People forget how ruthlessly prosecuted he was my Kenneth Star while he was in office. And how crazy that all that all that situation was. Um, who was leading it? Newt Gingrich, who as we said before, it was having an affair off his wife that was dying.

Speaker 5:          02:47:42       Yeah. And then there was another guy, the strategist who's the, uh, the Republican strategist. It was Ken Mehlman. No, that was after, that was the George W. Bush guy. Rove? No. Yeah. Call Ralf Karl Rove is about part of it too, right? Wasn't he partially involved Clinton thing? Maybe he's not. Maybe I'm confusing cause Karl Rove is definitely a part of the Jeff Gannon story. Um, I don't, you know, I don't know what that could have possibly been like for them, but I know that when Bill Clinton got out of office, apparently he was deeply in debt because of his legal fees. And the whole thing was just like off the chart. That was one of the things that Hillary talked about. Like she had said that when they left, when he left the office, they were dead broke. Well he obviously found ways to capitalize on it and did it.

Speaker 5:          02:48:22       But could you imagine being a guy who's a former president and is, how old was he at the time? Like maybe in his late fifties and fucking, not just dead broke but beaten down by public scandal. And you are, you're in debt to the tune of who knows how many dollars and you've lost all your money to legal cases cause you're fighting off impeachment by all these crazy people that want to prosecute you for doing shit that pretty much every president has done since the beginning of time, whipped his dick out and people just start sucking it because they're the fucking king. Cause it's crazy to be in that position in the first place. Who Cares? Well people should care because he lied. If you raped people or whatever, then that's one thing. But I'm just going to just the general, if the president's having affairs, who gives a fuck?

Speaker 5:          02:49:04       Is the country working? Is it this thing basically not going towards the iceberg then. Okay. But here's where it's curious. He didn't get prosecuted because he lied because obviously Obama now we don't now found out that he lied about the emails from the wikileaks. He lied to the American people. It is a small lie. It is a white lie I guess you could say cause nobody, you know, I mean might not be the worst luck. Obama's wasn't under oath. Clinton's was exactly that was going to get to. But the difference being that he didn't raise his hand and put his hand on the Bible and say, do you solemnly swear to tell the truth? Like why you have to, you have to, I have to know your really honest, like now, like this is the time where you can't lie anymore. So we have this crazy rule that if you do lie during that time, it's so different than when you lie about what FBI Administrator Komi or whatever the fuck his title is.

Speaker 5:          02:49:57       Yeah. Comb. He says about what you did and versus what you think you did. Right. Or whether it's who knows what other things, whether it's how many fucking cell phone she had or Ben Gazi or what are those lines where you have your team destroy all your old devices. But Hammers and I had a team, we actually did take some, uh, old hard drives out to the gun range. Yeah. And I, uh, I put some 300 win mag rounds into him. That'll, that'll show him who's boss cause we were going to get rid of him anyway. They were old. It is old bullshit. I said it'd be fun to take these to the range. Just blow them apart. Say I said we took them out there and I was siting in my rifle. Ooh. Should see what it does to one. I'd like to try that.

Speaker 5:          02:50:39       You would like to try that? I would do that with you sometime computers or you have some old laptops. You know what I did today? Um, I got off the apple tip. I got my apple laptop here, but I bought a windows laptop just to see what's going on a bottle. Yes they do. They make a Lenovo thinkpad. Uh, that's what I got. I was like think pads. I had one a long time ago and I'm so let's see what the newest thinkpads look like. I'm like, I still had that little red. Yeah, the little nipple that you play with. I like that thing. Yes. They have the nipple still. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got a p 50 Lenovo thinkpad p 50. So anyway, I get this thing pad and it has windows seven. Well, the newest windows is windows 10. So I try upgrading to windows 10.

Speaker 5:          02:51:18       Oh Geez. Three and a half hours later after to fucking live chats with people. They can't figure out how to get it to work to different people. I'm talking to um, with, uh, you know, tech support. They can't figure out how to get it to work. It's still got windows seven on it. I spent three and a half hours this morning, not as therapeutic as my little Yamaha stretches. Nothing. I didn't lose my, I didn't lose my temper because I treated it. I have a laptop. This one's getting kind of, it's got a lot of space taken up by porn and stupid shit and I'm fucking pool videos and a bunch of dumb stuff on my phone from my phone rather. And I was saying, and why I should probably get like a new laptop, like, why don't I see what windows 10 is like? So I figure if you buy a new laptop, oh, for sure it's going to have windows 10 on it. No one had fucking windows seven windows seven an

Speaker 2:          02:52:06       eight nine I didn't know that they did anything after 95 I thought it was windows 95 and then that was it. I heard windows 10 is good. I've, I've heard it reviewed by a tech people, so I'm, I'm hoping to see what the fuss is all about. But I've been, I at least, I think it might be like, like going, going to a really shitty job for a while and then coming back to your regular job and going, God is so much better. Isn't it funny how sometimes like if we're as connected as you may be, sometimes some technology just kind of gets passed you and then you realize you just like miss something. So for the last five years I've been using firefox, the browser, firefox, you're on chrome I guess. Right? So I'm using firefox. Nothing would work. Like things like videos would freeze, audio would freeze.

Speaker 2:          02:52:51       I couldn't open three windows at once, you know, like whole bunch of shit. And then my, uh, my director were, Mira saw me clicking firefox and she was, you know, she's 23 or 24. And she was laughing hysterically like, you fucking idiot. What are you doing? Why are you doing that? And then she said, you got to get on chrome. And I was like, no, that can't be any different than firefox. I thought everybody was on firefox, like for as much as I'm in this thing, this was, I don't know, I got on firefox and I just was there. Chrome is the shit. So now I'm on chrome. And guess what, you press play, you know what happens? Shit plays, she plays. Yeah. Well, I'm a big believer in the Google and one of the things that I've been thinking about is, uh, getting off the apple tit and, uh, using an android phone and a windows laptop.

Speaker 2:          02:53:31       So I'm going to try that over the next few months. This is the beginning of the end. I don't think so. I want to, I don't think being frustrated be such a bad thing. I mean, I think at the very least I can call people on good dude. I don't think I could send you a text anymore. Something's going on and send me pictures. I can't find him. That's a great way to get off the grid. Sorry. I heard when people say the pictures on those google phones, like they go into a folder, like if someone sends you a picture, it's attached to your text message. That picture like automatically goes into a folder and may not even exist on the tech stream. Like I don't get it. I don't know if that's the case. You know, even live like this, I'm going to find out, I'm going to find out.

Speaker 2:          02:54:06       I'm going to find it. I want to see what's going on. I'm going to try that. They have a, Google has a new phone called the Google Google Pixel heard about it and it's very highly received by tech dorks. The people that really know what the fuck they're talking about unlike me. And they uh, they really liked the camera. They were like the speed, the pure google experience, because nobody fucks with it. It comes straight from them. They don't have a third party software built into it so I'm going to say let's see what's going on. Cause I think if you just stay on the apple tit all the time, like when people send me a text message is all green, I can a little envy like this person is out there and just rebelling. They're out there and be wild and sending text messages. Now this morning when I was dealing with the Yamaha show you, I'm not making this shit up. See I'm just a real big fan of Google in general took a picture of a wire and it came back green and I thought what's this guy know that? I don't know. This guy's got green. He knows he knows things or he doesn't or he's poor, poor guy. He's going to be unemployed. It was very sad. It could be that he's just a crazy, he doesn't trust apple,

Speaker 3:          02:55:04       but there is something fucking weird about that. Those blue things like, and then if someone's got another kind of phone then it's Greens. Like oh they're an outsider. It's green. You didn't even send you a blue one. Like why? Why do you have different fucking collars for different people that have different phones? I don't like the word where that's going well the other ones that feel it's that 1984 commercial that apple did in 1984 when they were fighting windows at the time they were fighting Microsoft. But the idea that the bigger my apple gets and the more we just instinctively go to it. And by the way, I say this with all due irony because I got the iphone seven the day it came out. Awesome. Um, but you know, the more that we all do that you actually incentivize them to not innovate because if they know that if, cause this phone, really the reality is that this phone that we're both have right now, it barely is different than the, than the six.

Speaker 3:          02:55:52       Right. Are you finding it? But who are you now? We've been talking for awhile. A little better, a little better, but maybe a little worse. I like the annoying Shin and I do miss the phone and the headphone Jack. Yeah. Guess what? Sometimes I want to have a headphone plugged in while I'm in my car so I can talk to someone with a thing dangling from my ear because it's way easier to hear them that it is through speaker phone or what if you want to charge your phone and use headphones. I don't agree with what they're doing and I don't agree with what they're doing with laptops either where they're getting rid of USB and they have, now they have some new type of Usb like, come on man, this isn't any better. But the thing is that goes to my point. If they know that you're going to buy this shit no matter what, and they know us, they knew the day they put this out, they're going to make x amount of hundreds of millions of dollars if not more.

Speaker 3:          02:56:37       So the more that we all instinctively just go to them, the actual less they have. There's less incentive for them to give us good innovative shit because why keep changing it if you just tweak a couple of things and they don't put that much into it and we all do it anyway. I also think that it's probably important to support competition and to, you know, like when, I think once they reach a point where the tech people are saying this is the best phone, like a lot of the Google, the people that have a reviewed the Google Pixel, they're saying, I have ditched my iphone for this is the best phone in the market. Finally for the first time an android phone, I don't know if they're rooting for android and so they may have a biased opinion. My, my tribe, like these guys are out of their fucking mind.

Speaker 3:          02:57:19       Right. Well we're gonna find out, I'm going to find out about windows 10 and I'm going to find out about android. I want to give them both. A shot decided that recently I was like, this is just too instinctive a move for me to just go to apple. Like I remember when I was on news radio, it's when apple wasn't really even that good. It was before m o s 10 osx rather, which was the big operating system change where it went to unix based system opposed to the way it was before. It was like it would freeze up before it had no memory protection. You couldn't really multitask correctly. It did. It didn't have what they call preemptive multitasking. So like the tech people didn't appreciate the, the Mac platform until Osx and then Osx had this really like responsive user interface. It was very cool little animation things would

Speaker 2:          02:58:01       happen when you click on things and I saw that and what, Whoa, okay I want to try it, I'm going to try it. So I went, that's when I jumped back over from windows to Mac again. And there's so many people that get in these clans. It's like we were talking about with Republicans versus Democrats. There's a lot of clans. Like when I was on the set of news radio, one of the guys, this is back when Max sucked, one of the guys just like, uh, you know, do, do you hear our sales are up, our sales are up, but he's talking about like Max, I go our sales, he's like sounds of Matt. Cause you know, he knew he was a man. He'd have where apple t shirts and shit. He was such a, Bill Gates was there. Steve Jobs was the key grip on a news radio.

Speaker 2:          02:58:39       He, you know, he's a creative guy behind the scenes guy, but he was like so excited about apple sales being up. And I'm like, dude, this is weird. You're getting weird with me. You know we've got new, a new Mac. Books are coming up. Okay, don't you have a computer? Like what the fuck are we doing? What are we doing? We become slaves to these machine. Yeah. But then it was like apple was the underdog. It's a different experience. Well that's what I mean. That 1984 commercial, their whole point was you all bow down to Microsoft and we are the upstarts. Where are the people that are going to break the system? Break the Matrix. I think different. Think different and now it's like think the same and Natalie's they think the same and if you don't think the same, there's something wrong with you.

Speaker 2:          02:59:16       You've got a green text. What the Hell is wrong with you? Yeah. But you know, apple for all the cries of everybody with trump in the taxes because everything these days is somehow linked back to together. You know apple pays virtually no corporate taxes. Exactly. And what's his name? The head guy now tim cook basically it was like, yeah, when they rewrite fairer tax laws, we'll bring our money back here. Now know some back. For some reason nobody's upset by that. We don't see people throwing iphone is out the window. The problem is they have a responsibility as a gigantic corporation to the people that hold their stock. Like there's a weird thing that happens with corporations. They're public and people own stock in it. Like you have a direct obligation, your stockholders to make a profit. So it doesn't that prove trump's point though.

Speaker 2:          02:59:54       So it does proves his point because it's like, all right, I'm doing what's legal. Right at the end of the year when you're, when you go to pay your taxes, I'm pretty sure you tell your account in the same thing that every sensible person does, which is do whatever is legal and I want to pay the least amount of taxes. I don't, I still don't see everybody. Does tax shelters exist? Yeah. So I don't, so again, he hasn't released his taxes, so that's shitty. And he lied. And by the way, he's lying when he says the thing about auditing, you know, he's whole thing is, well I'm under audit so I'm not going to do it. But then, then the next sentence at the last debate, he was like, you know what, I'm going to write it but I won't do it. But if hillary releases her emails, I'll release my taxes.

Speaker 2:          03:00:28       And it's like, oh well, which is it? You know, I think it was the Goldman Sachs speeches, wasn't it? No, he said emails. He said emails, so he's lying. You know, it's just a way of lying. I'm under audit, which there is no technical reason that you couldn't. But then he says, but if she does hers, you know that thing I'll do, I'll do it. Well there's no technical reason, but that's his argument. It's like while they're auditing him, he's not going to do it cause he doesn't have to write. You know, which does make sense. Like if they are auditing him like why he wouldn't want to like open it up to public discourse. Right. So that, so that in itself may be, but the idea

Speaker 4:          03:01:00       that, but if she realizes her emails off, forget that whole thing with the audit and I'll go ahead and do it like that.

Speaker 5:          03:01:03       You think though that that would, if he did releases taxes while they were auditing him, it could positively effect for sure. Cause it would affect public opinion. And we know for a fact that public opinion has had a big impact on things that may, you know, if, if people didn't, they didn't get outraged about it. Maybe the president or whoever's in charge wouldn't move in a certain direction. Right. Right.

Speaker 4:          03:01:25       Well that's, but that's the point is that if you want this, if you feel that this stuff is broken, that the tax system is broken and all these guys that can hide money in, uh, you know, offshore accounts. If you think all that's broken, don't be upset at the businessman who used it. Now that doesn't mean what he was doing was ethical or whatever. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't. That's, that's a different conversation. But you have to be upset at the people who put the laws in place that allow this to happen. Any businessman just uses the system as it exists. So when all these people are like, well, trump makes his ties in Mexico. Yeah. He's a smart businessman in that regard. He uses cheap Mexican labor if you're upset and that that is the reality than be upset at the people who set up those trade deals.

Speaker 5:          03:02:05       But isn't the issue really not the, does the stuff in Mexico, the issue is that he does it in Mexico, but it only pays people at tiny amount of money. If somebody opened up a plant in Mexico and paid people American wages, there would be no incentive whatsoever to go to Mexico. We should have laws as human beings and what we're, what we allow. And not just in America, you can't just say, you go past this line, there's a rock over there. Once you pass that rock, you can pay him 7 cents an hour. But over here we get 11 bucks. You fuck right, right. So team Merica world police.

Speaker 4:          03:02:36       Yeah. So I'm not defending the ethics of his business practices, I'm just saying all a bit. As you said, they're, they're beholding to their stock shares and their holders and all that stuff. So I'm just saying if he didn't do anything illegal, then he just did. He just played the system. So you should be angry at the system and you can say he's immoral or took advantage in a way that a more less unscrupulous business person may not have. And maybe that's the type of person you would want to work with and not a Donald Trump. But that's why this is really complex. And we instead, people look at the ties in Mexico and they go see he's a hypocrite and it's like not quite the truth. Well he is. He's a, he's a hypocrite for a minute.

Speaker 5:          03:03:14       He's a hypocrite. I mean he was talking about of corporations go over to Mexico. It will, we'll find them to the tune of 35% yeah. Okay, but you were already there. No, but if you're running for president and you're making your ties over there, you should stop. Like, cause you're saying there's something wrong with the company taking their stuff and moving over there and profiting from it and taking jobs out of America. You do it. I've already done it, but I'm doing it right now. So if you do it, I'm going to find you.

Speaker 4:          03:03:36       So that's a at least, so you're making a distinction there that in the course of this he could have said, I'm not going to do it any more to show you that I'm going to be moral or whatever you want to call it, ethical or whatever. I will stop.

Speaker 5:          03:03:49       It isn't the ethical moral way to do it, to just pay them more. Yeah, of course. But that's unfortunately we live in a reality that, you know, that's what a loss so much it past that as human beings that live in the United States, in the world, the United States of America, one of the most fortunate countries, if not the most fortunate in the world. We will respect our American privilege and you know, not be willing to subjugate people that live in impoverished countries too. Like taking advantage of that. Don't do, don't take advantage of that. An unfortunate circumstances like if you're living in a very poor third world country and a Nike factory opens up or whatever, you can't. As a, as a person who is aware that they have the best like location roll the dice that's available today. You're living in America, you're born here like the fact that you're going to like make someone in some other country work for essentially with slave labor, like the phone you buy this fucking iphone having my hand is made in a factory where they have nets around the factory because so many people have tried to kill themselves that they made it where they catch you in a fucking net when you jump off the roof because they were cleaning up bodies off the ground.

Speaker 5:          03:04:58       And when people defend it, they defend it in the most bizarre way they, the defense is. Yeah. But the percentage of people that commit suicide of those factories is very similar to the percentage of people that commit suicide and the culture factory. No fucking money. And they live at the factory and the jumping off the roof. That's, you can't defend that. No. So then what do you make of our sort of fake moralizing with this where you, you are fully acknowledging we both have this thing, we both paid a lot of money for it. We acknowledge, we have the intellectual knowledge of what you just said, that they do some shady things and yet at the same time all these people that are doing the exact same thing with us that have this phone will go buzzard over the ties. So we, we picked we and that goes to this side's everyone's picking aside so well they can just go and ask you this guy.

Speaker 5:          03:05:45       They're going after this guy. And then there's, there's validity to what they're saying. Even though they have a phone that was built by slaves, there's still validity in what they're saying. And not only that, I mean we had Shane Smith from vice on one day and we were talking about the cult [inaudible] cult Tran, Colton, that they had to take out of the ground, the con in the Congo and how, you know, like the, the, the way they were getting a lot of the elements that they use in cell phones, it's fucking complete slave labor and child labor. I mean, it's scary, scary stuff when you get down to the nitty gritty of how things are manufactured and constructed in order for us to get them at a reasonable price, then it's, it's, it's just really spooky that we're willing to do that. It's, yeah, it's, it's just a, we just sinked up there. That was why, I mean we, it's partly, it's just the unintended consequences of wanting things, you know? It's also the unintended consequences of having this business model of unlimited growth. And that what we're talking about about trump having a sort of responsibility to its shareholders, just like apple having a responsibility to their shareholders like this, this thing of unlimited growth places more allity at the end of the list of, of motivations for what you're doing. And there's a thing called diffusion of responsibility that takes place when you have a gigantic

Speaker 3:          03:06:56       group of people, they call themselves a corporation. You're just a little piece of that corporation. It's not like Dave Rubin's out there making people work for 13 cents an hour. No, it's Microsoft or it's, you know, Hitachi or you know, fill in the blank. I don't know if those companies do bad things, but whatever company it is, apple, it's paying people ridiculously low wages. I mean, that is what it is. You know, it's, the corporation becomes this entity that needs Zeros and ones and you have to figure out a way to get them and you can, you get them by taking these people that have worked for us for 20 years, just fucking casting them out. Can you do that? Yeah, but they, they're good. They do a good job. Fuck them. You cut them off and you make asphalt face to the right, work for extra hours a day.

Speaker 3:          03:07:39       So then you take instead, think of all the executives and all the mid level people that they've got up in Cupertino making absurds amount of money. I'm not just talking about the shareholders who cashed in on talking about all those silicon valley guys making an absurd amount of money. I don't begrudge any of them any of that money. But imagine if all of them who could live incredibly well on 10% of what they have and funneled some of that money, did the same people making their shit. I'm not a socialist. That's why I'm not even saying this would be the right thing to do in any way. But like they, those people all walk around with a pretty clean conscience. You know, while they have, you know, the fancy, you know they probably all have teslas and all that shit and the people that are literally making the shit, not just the ones coming up with the, the ideas in Cupertino cause they always say you know, Boto in Cupertino but meanwhile they don't say made in China within that.

Speaker 3:          03:08:25       It is interesting how we really distinguished very clearly the difference between the person who has the idea and the person who puts the idea together with their fingers. Like that's not nearly as valuable but without that person putting it together. Because whatever gets done, like the manufacturing process does not just include the people that buy the machines. That includes the people that work for the people that buy the machines. But the people that buy the machines get so much more money than the people that work for them. And then the people that designed the plans and give them to the people that buy the machines, they get even more money. They get the most money. The people who design the idea is most important and I don't know if that's because of like the nature of the thing that like that it's, it's set up that way because that's, those are the people.

Speaker 3:          03:09:07       The people at the very top are the ones who are going to expand this weird thing that we're doing. Expand this technological sort of progression that just this ongoing wave of improvement and innovation that we demand. We demand new better versions. We not an iphone, seven's a piece of shit. When's the eight come out? Do the aid's going to have hd reality built in? The question really at the end of the day is are any of us happier or any of us more functional or any of us more? Yeah, like what have we done here? What have we done is any, if they were to gauge happiness of the average person who had the exact same physical attributes as you that grew up in the same town you grew up in in 1950 versus right now, is there any quantifiable difference? And I would

Speaker 5:          03:09:53       argue, I would guess that basically it's no, that doesn't mean this thing has done incredible things cause Tahrir Square, all the revolutions that haven't really worked out the way they're supposed to, but it connected people all over the world and that's pretty awesome. So it does, of course it does great stuff. But like in terms of what are we actually chasing constantly, as you said, there is no end because once it's always profit. Well we got an mu, nu, nu, nu, NU, nu. Cause you're not chasing happiness, you're not chasing fulfillment. You're not chasing, you know, whatever the, the end game of the human experiences, you just chasing something. I don't think it's for humans. I think it's for the next thing. I think we're setting it up for the next thing or the little workers that are building the shop for the machine overlords. Oh man, we're the guys with the nats or we're the guys with the nets.

Speaker 5:          03:10:34       We just don't think we are. We're our thirst for technology is probably connected in some way to this thing wanting to emerge and that as we become more and more materialistic and interested in the latest and greatest, we feel we fuel this, this innovation and we're a part of it whether we like it or know it or not. That's why like as a human being, it's very frustrating and confusing when you're addicted to technology, when you're caught up in it and locked away in it. And for me, I find that the only way I stay happy as by being involved in very physical things like, and I think that's one of the reasons why record numbers of people are depressed today. I think they're not fulfilling the human requirements, their biological human requirements. For me, exercise is gigantic. Meditation is also gigantic, which I also consider a very physical thing because it's, it's a focus.

Speaker 5:          03:11:23       Concentration internally versus on whatever bullshit is on my fucking twitter feed or whatever facebook feed or dealing with some nonsense about a job you don't really give a fuck about. Instead of that, I'm focusing on things that are important to me, like the management of the actual mind itself. I think putting yourself in a competition scenario is putting in things where you have to perform under pressure. That's one of the reasons why people get so addicted to Jujitsu because then it's like this high level problem solving thing that you're doing all the time and it makes regular life seems so much more easy to manage and regular dilemmas are nothing compared to a fucking hundred 90 pound man who's built like a gorilla on your back trying to choke you sleep. That reminds me of the gym in West Hollywood and actually what I did there, probing ladies and gentlemen, but I think regardless, it's happening.

Speaker 5:          03:12:10       It's happening to US regardless. The technology in my mind, nonsense and talking to you about switching a windows 10 and a fucking google phone, this bullshit stupid. It's not going to fix anything and I'm not trying to, I'm not claiming to not claiming that I ever possibly could or have the influence, but what I'm saying is you as a human being have an obligation to yourself. To extract that happy juice out of your body in a positive way. And I don't think we're designed to sit at desks. I don't think we're designed for fluorescent lights. I don't think we're designed for movies and all those things are great. All those things are great, but you got to manage the amount of exposure you have. Did that shit. You have to manage the amount of exposure. You have to fictitional narratives. You have to merit, you have to manage the kind of exposure you have to electronic influence.

Speaker 5:          03:12:55       You have to manage the, there's just like, you have to manage the type of people that are in your life. You around people that are complaining all the time. If you just around people that just wine and like, oh my God, another day, Hey, you know, I'm sure you didn't see the movie, but uh, there was a, this kid's movie about, um, inside out and it's about like this girl's brain. It's a little kids moving. So all of my daughters, but it's a little kid's movie about like, this girl has like these characters in her brain. One of them's anger and Lewis Black place anger, which is fucking awesome. And uh, and the other one is sadness and sad. I was like molly and everything, sadness touches becomes sadness. Like everything turns blue. It's kind of an interesting movie because it's funny, it's entertaining, but it's also, it's kind of, there's a lesson to be learned for children that like you can, you can marinate in those fucking thoughts.

Speaker 5:          03:13:45       You can allow those thoughts to influence and touch all these different aspects of your life. Or you can figure out how to stop them, like understand what they are. These are, these are these thoughts or it's almost like a living thing, like a life force and that living think and grow if you feed it. But if you don't feed it and you push this side and you feed the positive thing, you can manage that little fucker might not ever go away because you're not living in a movie. But you could definitely manage it way better than you're doing if you don't take conscious decisions and what kind of energy you let into your life.

Speaker 4:          03:14:14       Yeah. Well, we all know people that are addicted to their own pain or their own trauma, their own story. And no matter what you do, you know you can't. And they love it. They love it. We all have relatives like this or, or friends and it's like, you gotta do the work. It is work. Life is work. It is, it is endless. It's endless till it's over. And then you may regret not doing some of the work.

Speaker 5:          03:14:36       It's also, it's your [inaudible]. It's not, there's no, it's not like there's no options. There are options to fit thought patterns. And if you just allow these like deeply ingrained paths to exist in your mind, where you immediately fall into complaining and the woe is me. It never works out for me. You know, someone sent me a text the other day comparing to people. There was two, the same thing happened to, people are at the same event and one person had this horrific like, like all my God, this is terrible. This is the worst, is such a waste of my time. And the other person was, well, uh, it hasn't been good yet, but there's still time, exclamation point, Smiley face. I'm like, this is a perfect example. The difference between two different people in the exact same experience having two different patterns that they allow their brain to go down.

Speaker 5:          03:15:23       Now what if you find that that guy's on his zoloft that has an issue? That's an issue, right? And that's what a lot of people do instead of one. And again, this is not to disparage people who have legitimate mental imbalances where they need medication. I have a bunch of friends that have had that. But the question with that is like, is that nature or nurture? Like what does it become, what it was causing these negative thoughts in your mind? Is it a biological issue that you have because part of you is not working correctly, which is entirely possible? Or is it you've embraced these negative thoughts and this negative program by your family or by people that you hang around with are bad influences and you've embraced it to the point where you're unable to take these positive thought patterns. You know, you almost like have to go to a retreat.

Speaker 5:          03:16:05       They almost have to like kidnap you and put you on some island somewhere where somebody talks to you and he goes, hey man, this is, this is life right now is life. You don't have to get back to that email. You think I know you think you do. Right. You know you don't have to get back to those people that are negative, that are in your life. You don't have to like, this is life. This right here, breathe in, breathe out. You're alive. You're also alive and maybe the greatest fucking time the world has ever known. I mean come on man. There's never been, it's never been easier to get food. It's never been safer to walk the streets. There's never been more cool, cool people to communicate with. This is the best fucking time ever. Like don't go woe is me. Cause some girls want to suck your Dick Anymore.

Speaker 5:          03:16:38       Just do we. Can you just fucking stop and relax for a moment? If you were a 90 year old man living in Ecuador, you know that his whole life he had been forced to be a farmer working for pennies and eating fucking raw potatoes and shit, and someone gave you the opportunity to come here and beat you. Now how God damn happy would you be? You'd be so happy. Well, that is you. That's you right now. You won the lottery bitch and you're still complaining and 99.9% of the people listening have won the lottery in comparison to all the other people that they're going to come in contact with. So in a lot of the other people, you're, you're almost making a case though, for people to, that the key to happiness in the midst of this technological monstrosity that were part of that. The key really is to disconnect yourself from it and there that comes with certain costs too.

Speaker 5:          03:17:28       I don't think the disconnect, I think to have discipline. I think for me, at least, my, my best happiness comes from when I have discipline and avoiding the technology or, or limiting my access to the technology and consciously choosing to do other things. You know, get involved in other hobbies, get involved in, uh, you know, like whether it's yoga or archery or you know, go run marathons or go, you know, get involved in, you know, to go in or a Jujitsu tournament, go, uh, climb a mountain. There's things that people do that are hard to do and you don't just do it to get to the top of the mountain I think. Or to, you know, finish the cross. That line that you decided you're going to run to. You do it because you, your, your body requires it. Your brain may require it like you as a being as an entity, problem solving and puzzle solving is a part of who you are. Overcoming adversity is a muscle that's gotta be exercise. Yeah. Cause if it's not, then once the shit hits the fan, you fucking fall apart. And we all know people like that. They're just went, one bad thing goes on in their life. They become blabbering fucking idiots. Yeah, that's, I mean that's why you gotta just push you, you like you have no choice in a way. I guess once you see that, which seems fairly

Speaker 3:          03:18:48       obvious to someone if you're awake enough, once you see it, you gotta just push and push and push and you will fail. As I've said several times, like you're going to fail at it and I fail at it all the time where suddenly three hours went by and I go, Oh shit, I just stared at twitter but three hours literally just taking my dog for a walk sometimes that that would just reset it and then I feel better after that. Yeah. And if you don't do that, it's taking that step, get yourself to take that step and just once you're doing something, it's usually pretty easy to do it. Like once you're working out, it's pretty easy to be there once your start like, oh, this is what I'm doing now and I actually started enjoying it. It's making yourself take that step. You know like this is a lot of times for Yoga class where I'm like I could just stay here.

Speaker 3:          03:19:28       I watch TV, I fucking put my feet up and do nothing. Man, I'm feeling kind of sore. Maybe I should relax. Like your brain starts playing all these fucking mind games with you but when you do go to yoga class and you take that class in, 90 minutes later you've lost fucking eight pounds of sweat and you've been freaking out and almost blacking out. When you get out of there you feel better. I feel better. I feel way better. And it gives you also I think momentum and motivation to continue with the rest of your life too to keep pushing forward. What do you think about um, the fact that you are your own boss also? Cause pretty much I, you know, I know you have outside gigs too, but for the most part, probably 90% of what you do, I would guess is, is you are in charge of the, the ultimate decisions if not 100%.

Speaker 3:          03:20:10       Maybe it's, well not the UFC. The UFC is my one job that I have, but right. And it's still, it's a job, but it's the greatest job I've ever had. That's what he was a super pleasure. And it's also, um, it's an honor and it's also, there's a massive obligation to respect and represent the people that are competing in what I think is one of the most difficult physical endeavors in all of sports, if not the most. I think it's incredibly difficult to do. And I feel like I'm in a very privileged position to represent those people. But yeah, I like it that I don't need it. Yeah. I love that. I love that. I love, I like not having a boss man. Even though my boss is amazing, you know, that job was the greatest job of all time. I like doing things when I want to do them too, but it's not like I'm lazy.

Speaker 3:          03:20:55       So I pushed myself to do a lot of shit and I, you know, I have goals and accomplish them or attempt to, and I have, you know, commitments as far as like writing and performing and producing things. But um, yeah, being your own boss, man, if you could pull it off, it's like the greatest thing ever because it's not work anymore. It's like you're working for yourself, but you're, you're doing things instead of working like that, punching in. I mean, I went independent in June, so it's only, I'm not even six months out of that. And not only was it the smartest business decision I ever made, which partly was because I saw guys like you and Corolla and a couple other guys that will, I was like, wait a minute. They built great brands. They have their fans and they're doing it. Like I, it was like, I was like, oh, there's actual template for this. If I, if I built my audience correctly. And I just took the risk and said, you know, let's see what happens. And

Speaker 2:          03:21:46       we know we launched this patrion campaign, which is where fans can donate per month, whatever they want so that, you know, do you do like two bucks to get a newsletter? We people that donate 250 and I skyped with them every month and like a whole bunch of different things. I didn't know when I woke up the next morning after we launched it, they might've been over my career, literally might've been over like just like that because I quit my job. I had no, I had no job. My producer had no job. My director, I had no job, no insurance, no nothing. And I woke up and our fans showed up and they took care of us. And because of that, now in the six months since then, now I bought this House and build in the studio and we're figuring out all other ways to to make deals and all that kind of stuff and it's incorrect.

Speaker 2:          03:22:25       But I still wake up sometimes. This is my point was I still wake up sometimes I'm like, wait a minute. So I have to answer to somebody. Like I have a feeling it's just a feeling, you know, like, wow, I can't believe this. I, I make the decision here and a way like that, that hunger that, that you know, that fear that to take that chance and to do things, that's like one of the best things you could ever have in life because it's the motivator. If you don't, if you're not like a woe is me, I'm always going to be a loser. If you're a person who really tries to do something, risk taking is so God damn critical because it forces you to action and it forces you to be inspired and to get fired up and that's when things really take place. It really is like that's, and that's one of the things that Scott Adams had said sort of about the election is that there's such chaos now, but whatever happens after out of chaos, something new will happen.

Speaker 2:          03:23:12       May Not be good immediately. May Not be bad. I mean, we don't know what that will be, but the chaos, the chance, the risk will now allow for something else to happen. So all these people who, you know, all these pundits who got everything wrong for the last year, and oh well it's going to be a rubio, it's going to be cruise, blah, blah, blah. It's like they'll now tell you everything else that there is going to happen for the next year and they're going to get all that wrong. But out of chaos, that happens. And that's what I realized. I had a path, I had a salary and I was doing fine. And I liked working at Ora and Larry King's been great to me and it was all good. But I just had this feeling of like, I gotta try this. I got to try this. You get a very different position if it didn't work, you know?

Speaker 2:          03:23:48       Yeah. You don't want to be that guy who just wishes they took that chance and you're still working for some company and they still treat like shit. I mean, because that's, you know, in that sense, you're the person making the phones. You're not the person with the idea and the person with the idea. Especially if you're a smart guy like you are, it's you do yourself a disservice if you don't express yourself completely, fully and without any reserve or any reservations. And when you work for someone, you'll always have a reservation. You're always worried, man. You're always, you always like biting your tongue or flavoring your words or you know, they come into your office and go, Dave, you've been really hard on Clinton. I think it's really important for Mike. You know the, the produce a producer is a, he's got Hashtag I'm with her on his twitter account and we just wanted you to just think about doing that, like criticized her if he choose to, but be balanced, be balanced and you're being real like you're, you're being silly, but you're also being real.

Speaker 3:          03:24:44       That is the real shit that's going on. Hashtag I'm with her. Yeah. You know, you've got to have a Hashtag Jeanette, the president of the company is going to come down and talk to you about a lot of the things you said. I don't necessarily disagree, have been kind of misogynist, you know, and, and maybe just a little bit unsupportive of women's issues. And uh, this company is very progressive and we really feel strongly that that's the kind of shit that p that and you don't get to very progressive. So you should think exactly like you have to be Dave Ruben with a mortgage who's worried about losing his job, then that's, that's not good for business. It's not good for thinking it's not good for humans. It's not good for the business of culture. And I don't mean business, but the, the endeavour, the Endeavour of culture, the endeavor of culture requires like sort of some sort of an open discourse, you know?

Speaker 3:          03:25:26       And that includes shit like wikileaks. Okay. That's a part of the open discourse when you tell someone like Chelsea manning that they can't let anybody know about this horrific shit that's going on, that you know, is illegal. You've, you've set up this sort of a system where you're stopping data from going through it. You're stopping people from communicating and you're going to ultimately stop people from expressing their opinions on what was communicated, which is going to stop progress. A Russian hacker, the shit must be, I'm just stuck pot smoking hippies, but no hair. All of us are just fucking people. Dave Rubin, and I think that's one of the things that's going to come out when the dust settles and we pick a new king or queen, we're going to figure it out. Anything's going to happen now that we been talking to is going to win and everyone's going to hate her and it's going to be record record number of people that are intolerant and say crazy shit and you know, and we're going to have to all figure out a way to get along.

Speaker 3:          03:26:21       Do you see any situation where we wake up tomorrow night that trump's president? 100% yeah. Yeah, I do. I don't think it's going to happen. I would think. I think most likely Hillary's going to win. But I absolutely could see just some giant fuck up where the mass media has been lied to by polls and by public opinion. And I don't think necessarily polls are very accurate anymore because I don't think people choose to take polls very often. Mostly call land lines. When's the last time you had an exact a mundo? I had a joke about that in my last special, but like, like maybe you're dealing with 1%, like the problem with polls is the people who answer polls. Yeah. That's the problem. Have you ever been pulled? Ever? Never. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So it's, it's a weird thing that we're doing here where we're basing that on Poles.

Speaker 3:          03:27:09       Exit polls are different. It's a little bit different, but that was way off, um, during with Al Gore, right? I mean they, the predicted Al Gore to be, apparently he was like the popular winter, right when he won the popular, why doesn't he run, Fuck's going on? And I'm not a huge, I know, it's very cool to say like, I'm not an outdoor guy. Yeah. You know, you know what Al Gore did? He uh, he created current television. Right. And then that, you know, then eventually when he, it was a failure as a network. It was purging money. Right. And then he had a choice. He could see you had a couple offers

Speaker 2:          03:27:42       on the table, could have sold it to Glenn Beck, but I guess he doesn't like Glenn's back politics. That's fine. He sold it to Al Jazeera, which is owned by the government of Qatar that puts out more fossil fuel, oil, garbage, the same stuff that he rails against all day long. And he sold him that. So he basically did the producers, he used all his, all of his connections and money as a vice president to get a network on the air because it's incredibly hard to get into the cable system. So he used all his leverage to get there, created a failure. And he walked away, I think with $500 million and it was all funded Qatar. And it was in many ways funded by his humanitarian campaign to alert the world the dangers of global one. Yeah. That was what gave him credibility. So he, that's a cosby situation.

Speaker 2:          03:28:24       It's a card. And on that note, we're gonna wrap it up with that. Dave Rubin. That was just a three and a half hours. Holy Shit. Yeah. I honestly had no idea. I have no, when I'm on stage or when I'm doing my show, I have no sense of time. So don't do three and a half hour shows. Man. People get pissed. They look at their wall with the longest one. Was it? Was it sam? Four hours. What's your longest one? Oh, I don't know man. I'm five and a half for fight companions. No Shit. Yeah, we've done some long fucking podcast in here. I can't shut the fuck up. Yeah. Good job for me. Listen, I am now going to publicly, you've already agreed to do it, but I'm publicly you gotta you gotta come on like I'll do it. I'll do it. I know you will. I'll do it a little guilty at the end. If we've had a nice report here, there's a been a great conversation and how to get your podcast, where can they go to? youtube.com/rubin report, Ruben report.com [inaudible] on twitter. We're on the itunes. It's a, it's my branding guy is pretty good. That's all that report you motherfuckers respect. All right. We'll see you soon. Bye. Thanks brother. Thank you.

Speaker 6:          03:29:22       That was good. Yeah.
