Shroom tech sport is one of my all time favorite supplements and if if we didn't sell it at on it, I would push a justice hard. It is fantastic stuff. If you're into anything that's very difficult to do. If you're into like some sort of crossfit star working out or if you wrestle or do martial arts or anything that's very, very strenuous.

Speaker 2:          00:05:47       Try it by day. Joe Rogan podcast all day, my friend.

Speaker 1:          00:05:55       Well, martial artists, former kickboxing champion, commentator for glory, more accolades on and on. And I'm trainer of some of the greatest mixed martial arts artists on the planet earth. Two goofus ladies and gentlemen. Thanks Joe. It's been a pleasure. We had a great workout today. We are changing, exchanging some thoughts. Retro Rogan, man. That's, that's our new term. Retro Rogan. Well, those tickets, what we're talking about is a martial arts techniques that were a part of what you would consider a traditional martial arts like taekwondo or karate, that a lot of these techniques are starting to find their way into MMA. And so the arcs and kicked and kicked by Raymond Daniels, knock out of the century. A Ed Cory 16. Yeah, he threw this Raymond Daniels who was a, a guy who had a background and karate. Is that as it is? He took karate or taekwondo. Kempo. Kempo similar.

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       Not unlike a MMA open martial arts tournaments. Even though you have one style, everyone's got to learn how to do it so everyone knows how to spin kick and so forth. Um, that was an incredible kick. Yeah, he threw like a sidekick with his right leg and then in the middle of the air spun and hit the guy with a spinning side kick in the face with his left leg was just beautiful to watch. Go look it up on Youtube. It's incredible. Yeah, we'll pull it up. Raymond Daniel. We might've played it on the podcast because it was so awesome, like after it had happened to Raymond Daniels, uh, k Oh, it's just wild, wild kick. And it was a crazy fight before that, that he was in this wild exchange, caught the guy with a punch, heard him, dropped him, and then finished him off of this wild kid it and style.

Speaker 1:          00:07:30       Actually, I mean, you look at some of the, we were talking MMA kicks. Yeah, I'll test. So now even some cool stuff. Some of my favorite spin kicks in kickboxing. We're Stefan Leco verse, uh, Badr Hari one in Amsterdam. He, he knocked Badr Hari out with a back kick. Then that was June of oh five. Then November, November, December of [inaudible] Five, her Hari came back and knocked him out with a wheel kick. And then, uh, I think a year later, uh, Peter Graham knocked out Badr her with a rolling thunder kick. I mean, people don't think of that, those types of moves and kickboxing, but yeah, people are using them. High level guys, if you could do, we were just one of the things we were talking about today. If you can do the traditional techniques, like in mode, in kickboxing, leg kicks, knees, all those things. If you're good at all those things, then you can add those things to your, to your repertoire.

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       The rolling thunder kicks that wheel kicks. So we're starting to see that a little bit more and kickboxing, but a lot more in MMA and MMA it's become a big weapon. Yeah. I think an MMA is just so wide open because of there's so many weapons on the battlefield. I think it's easier to catch people with them because you don't know it's a takedown. Four ounce gloves changes everything the size of the cage, they move around a little more. It makes it, I, I, it's a controlled chaos in there and I enjoy that. I can kind of get crazy with striking. Well, do you think is that you're in a really interesting too because you're, you're, I mean, people think of the UFC as being established sport and it most certainly is, it's on Fox. It's on paper view. You know, you say UFC, everybody knows what you're talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:09:06       Pretty much mainstream. However, it's still in this growth stage as far as the techniques themselves. No one has, like if you're playing football, there's pretty much everybody plays football. Like a football player. You don't see people doing anything you'd like, where the fuck did that come from? But in MMA on any given night, you'll see some crazy submission that no one's ever done before. You'll see someone do some crazy flying kick that no one's ever attempted before. You, you see things that you'll see them for the first time ever, like in a match and you go, that's the first time. Like perfect example, um, Mitch Clark pulled off a, a a Darce choke from the bottom against a ally Quinta. And no one had never done that before. No history of the UFC. Nobody had ever pulled off a Darce like a guard pass. Doris like Jeff Glover hits that, that move all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:10:00       Guard pass Doris in an MMA fight. No one's ever done it from the bottom. That's what I enjoy about MMA. Like I said, the chaos, something new is happening. I mean, I remember when Alan Belcher and on the Tanwin says Nanako would call them, but my man Alan Belcher hit that Superman Punch at the UFC 100 and that was kind of the beginning of even our little evolution of, of doing it. And then Anthony did it against bark, Pella Chesky he did a superman punch in WC. And then of course is showtime kick against role where you actually use the cage to sweep rower. I mean you were at our old Jimmy saw small. It was, and that's where a lot of our like, uh, you know, birth of those techniques. And I told you how it started. It's a blend of wound Bach and the movie, the Lords of Dogtown, uh, the, the documentary on it, like how they change skating and I just, I dunno, I got an a cloudy little phase where I, I just wound Barack ran off the cage then all these other techniques and, and here we are.

Speaker 1:          00:11:00       I actually, I mean I'm not bs and when I say to Anthony as like another 10 moves he can do off the cage, it's awesome. Oh, I believe it was it, that was the thing about the showtime kick was that it was pretty clear after he, after he threw the kick and then after he talked about it, this is not a technique they just came up with on the fly. This is something that they had drilled. Oh yeah. It was so funny. September before that fight, um, he did a shoot with, uh, the UFC magazine and he was doing the kick off the wall on the pads and then they're all like, stop. I'm like, what did we do wrong? We want to get our iPhones out the film, this, they're loving all the cool things here. He's doing. And then the, in that camp, he was doing it a lot off the wall with his training partners.

Speaker 1:          00:11:40       I mean, uh, I, I love Anthony's, my really good friend. We're close. He's a, he's a god rather than my little daughter and he's so open minded. I'll show him something and people look at him like, yeah, right. I remember my really good friend a Giuseppe. I was up at his place. I was shown the showtime kick at a seminar, the seminar before. Everyone's like, there's no way. And I got so many texts after the vite. Yeah, you were right. You know, I love that. I mean, um, you know, it's again, like you're talking about who, who would've thought Alan Belcher did what he did against Paul Harris. He put them in the twist or almost finished him with the twister and then not again, we've seen, uh, the Korean Zombie catch up. Leonard Garcia with the twist or, I mean, these are all moves would be obvious.

Speaker 1:          00:12:22       Doesn't work. I think anything works if you train it enough. Yeah. And we'll, the Paul Harris fight was really interesting with Alan Belcher because Paul Harris is known for being this terrifying leg lock master. Nobody wants to go to the ground with them cause you go to the ground with him. He just ripped guys and legs apart. I mean you saw it in his world series of fighting premiere. Oh yeah. Fought for 30 seconds. Got Ahold of the guy's lag, rips his ligaments apart, its death. I call him the Mike Tyson a of of, of grappling like people fear, grappling him. There's not a lot of guys that people were like, I fear, but he has that Mike Tyson esque approach. Aw Man, my legs going to be toast. You know, I remember in the fight, no Alan. Oh wait, keep doing that. You're doing great. Yeah. When he went to the ground with them and it was engaging them with leg locks, I was like, this is crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:13:08       Like he's going to get submitted here. He's going to get his leg ripped apart. But Alan had perfect defense. It was one step ahead the entire way. You could really see that he had studied Paul Harris his game and just knew how to defend it and it just was with him every step of the way and then beat him down. Oh No. That was fun. Again, I love having people do things that people can't or don't think they can do. I did an interview with Ron Kirk and inside MMA, um, rate the week of Anthony's fight with Henderson. They said, so how's the Viking? I go down and he's going to beat him with striking. I said he's gonna beat him anyway once they're like, yeah, right. I'm, I'm, I'm telling you, he can submit Ben Henderson, who was the closest ever to submitting Ben Henderson before he did Anthony.

Speaker 1:          00:13:50       Exactly. Almost caught him with a good team right back. Yep. So the guillotine, any Ed, uh, the rear naked choke. So, you know, I love instilling that. Never put limits on yourself. You know what I mean? You talk about it in your broadcast and if you're world class at one thing, you can decide to be world class in another thing. You take that drive you had that got you to be a worldclass martial artists in this discipline. Go put it. And the other one, well I think people forget too with Anthony Pettis who's the current UFC lightweight champion. People forget how good his ground game his cause he's so scary standing up. They think of him as the guy who knocked out Joe Lozan with a head kick knocked out, Donald's Serone with a liver kick. They think of him as this devastating kicker, which you most certainly is, but they forget about his triangle of Shane Roller. They forget about his wicked ground game that he showed in the first Henderson fight where he took his back. He had his back for a full round. I believe him. I'm going to look them up quick. He might have more wins by submission. The knockout actually that's crazy. People forget for whatever

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       reason they don't think of his ground game as like the same level as they think of his striking game. And it's just, it's because it's striking game is so scary because everybody's afraid of getting knocked out. And his, uh, his striking game is very unique in its effectiveness.

Speaker 4:          00:15:08       Well, what I love about a lot of the guys that trained mostly all the guys and Gals, they're trained, they're very open minded. They want to get better all the time. Anthony's had a little downtime, he couldn't kick. So he's becoming a master boxes. Sit Up there. 15 submissions, 65% by submission. Yup. There you go. That's crazy. Yeah. Uh, you know, it's, it's, uh, I, I love the change. You know, again, everyone's worried about the knock off. He wants to go to the Mat, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:15:37       Yeah. He can do it. All. A kid can do it all. It's gotta be nice for you to like train having trained that guy like from the jump and to see him like flourish and become the Wec champion and then the UFC champion in such a spectacular way. That's got to be beautiful.

Speaker 4:          00:15:52       Yeah. I mean, I, I started crying slightly in Milwaukee in the octagon tears of joy. I mean, if anyone deserved it. He did. He's got a great attitude. He's a cool kid. I always say it's the coolest famous guy. No, I mean, wherever else we go. He, everyone knows him as the guy who jumped off the cage, he showtime. But to me it's just a Anthony, this really cool kid when he's at our academies, just mellow when he's in his element. He's a very humble guy, but that's what makes them great. You know, he's, he, we might go to Thailand and do some cross training with saint shy. Um, I want to talk to Nick Holt can from Gloria and, and having like Anthony, he's hungry to train with everyone. One of his best friends from Milwaukee's on the money team. One of the top boxers sees eight and old for Floyd Mayweather. So while he's in Vegas, during the ultimate fighter is going to be training with the money team too. I mean, this is the type of guy he's a, wants to be a master martial artists. So he's trying to train with the best core. Are you guys best Muay Thai boxers, wrestling, Jujitsu, you name it. He'll do it. Yeah, and that's what we were talking about before. This sport is

Speaker 3:          00:16:55       really evolving and growing and developing and you know, in a lot of ways he represents a new element. He represents like the taekwondo stylist who got really good at everything else and now has that weapon above everybody else. Everybody can Moitai everybody can do Jujitsu, everybody can wrestle, but not everybody can throw kicks like him on top of all those things. And he's one of the few guys is known like, like very cro cop, like in a way, you know, no one for just devastating kicks. That's a, that's a big weapon to have.

Speaker 4:          00:17:27       What I love, what I love about kicks, they're very unpredictable strikes. And when they hit you and they didn't land, they still hurt. You hit your arm and you're like, what was that? You know, I love that look. I'm fighters face when he kicks him and it's like the look in their face. Like what? Wait a minute. I'm not supposed to feel like that

Speaker 3:          00:17:46       dude. You were demonstrating shit on me today. Just lightly me

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       demonstrating shit. There's the kicks to my forearm. Just just, just popping the Shin into my farm. It's like, ah, your arms starts going numb and you're barely hitting me. Barely hitting my leg. Just, just thumping it. Just a little bit of that. And it's like, man, you can't even for the average person, they really have no idea what it would feel like if a guy like pedis or garlic, you leg kicked him. They have no fucking idea how hard that would be. Well, even let's think about Anderson shattering his leg and Tyrone Spong. Yeah. Like when I was at the glory fight, we're Tyrone Spong. Uh, I knew right away, I'm like, the fights over. You can hear it was like being at a baseball game and you hear the crack of a bat, you know? That's all you heard that Oh yeah, I heard it right away.

Speaker 5:          00:18:36       It was a very ugly sound. And you know that that's a one dip. Like, oh, explain combat sports. Like I always get people, one's better than the other. They're all freaking crazy. I think it's crazy to have to do eight Jujitsu mantras in a data when the world, some Jujitsu. I think it's crazy to have to do 10 minute rounds and Abu Dhabi's and how many studs? I mean, it's crazy to win an NCAA championship. How many matches over how many days? It's crazy to box 12 rounds and get punched in the Dome for 12 rounds. It's crazy to get elbowed and clinched. And Thailand, it's crazy to to win a glory tournament. It's crazy to MMA. They're all tough in their own right. I've, well I respect each one of them. But when it comes to striking, I think the most brutal thing you'll ever do striking wise as an eight man tournament, which happened in glory this weekend, cause you gotta beat three dudes in one night.

Speaker 5:          00:19:31       So you got to like, imagine you, you kicked me really hard. My arms jacked. Well I won, but my right arm doesn't work. Wait a minute, you kicked my left leg. My hand's broken. I mean, I've never been able to win a beat three guys in a night. I've tried and it's tough. I'm better at single fights, but these guys who go out there and can beat three guys in one night and find that the nuts to do it, I don't know how they do it still. I only fought kickboxing three times and it was all in one night. I fought in a tournament like that. Oh Wow. I won the first fight, won the second fight and I lost in the finals. And you, you're so beat up by the time it gets to the files, your body, it's just done. It's like you're, you're, it's like fighting with the flu.

Speaker 5:          00:20:11       It's like fighting. You just, there's nothing left you, you're a shadow of yourself and plus you have time to cool off. That's getting that adrenaline kicked in again. It's like, I remember, um, 2001 I fought in Vegas. I knocked out two mosque. Who's for Shooski right away I felt great. Like, whoop, celebrate. Oh Shit. Hey asshole, you got to fight again. Sorry, I got to go get up. But Mike McDonald and your body cools down. You know, you've got to be able to control, you know, I mean I love and then knock the guy out so you get so high, there's no better feeling than finishing someone in a fight. So you're like, oh wait, tone down dude, you got two more fights to win. You know, and it's a special thing. I think that is the wildest feet. Another crazy sport to me is Kyle Keshon karate.

Speaker 5:          00:20:57       I was at an all Japan karate championship and I've never seen those guys are the most insane people. They just sit there and you kicked me, I kick you, you punched me with bare knuckle and to one of us falls down and we'll fight 16 guys in it. It's a really inefficient way to fight though. I don't understand it. Well, I punching to the face and punching to the body. They're standing right in front of each other. I just think, not all of them, you know, there's the great ones like Andy hugged, right? Michael Thompson who you know, were more effective. You know, they move around and you know, that's actually GSPS core discipline. Um, you know, there, there are guys who really get into the Butoh. I'm not into it. I think it's more dangerous. And Moy, Tai, you know, it's uh, me, the style I love might die, but the style I've always related to is the evasive fighters who hit and don't get hit.

Speaker 5:          00:21:44       I mean, that's my rule. I'd like to hit you a lot and please never hit me. Well, I think we're seeing that more reinforced in appreciated more in MMA. There was a period of time that was disturbing to me. We're guys were just banging, you know, I remember I read some guy's Twitter account who was a really nice guy and I read something. He wrote something about like, fuck, technical striking. You know, I think what you do is you get out to you, if you're a man, you stand in the center of the cage and you bang, you meet each other side of the cage and bang and let the, let the chips fall where they may. And I'm like, that is the craziest debts. So I can't even tell you how dumb that is. That's like saying fuck steering. When you're on a race car, fuck steering, you just fucking hit that gas and whoever gets to the finish line, that gets to the finish line.

Speaker 5:          00:22:30       That's so ridiculous. Like you have to be technical, otherwise you're not. You're not, you're, you're, you're not doing it your best. What you're doing is you're handicapping yourself for machismo for bravado. Like what? Why would you stand in front of a guy and trade blows with them? There's a, there is a chronic problem. I'd say right now an MMA, there's a lot of fighters who have had some cerebral issues and you know, I think Martin Kampmann it's taking some time off. I know I can't say a few other fighters I know of that I've heard and I'm not sure if it's public, they've taken time off from, from taking too many blows and l your thing, that should be, I thought martial arts is about self defense. If we really get to the root of martial arts, it's, we're not to get your ass kicked. And I think the defense is everything.

Speaker 5:          00:23:17       The greatest fighters in every discipline of all at defense. You know, and I think whether it's grappling, weather, great wrestlers don't get taken down. Great Jujitsu guys don't get submitted. Great. Kickboxers don't get knocked out may whether it doesn't get hit. Um, you know, like you're saying, it's easy to get, I went through a stage in my career where yeah man, I'm going to go out there and put on a show and you know, I'm just going to bleed for the crowd. Well you know what, when you're done bleeding, you put the show on, uh, it doesn't help your career.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       I'm not saying fight boring, but um, like just purposely going out there and making it exciting. Yeah, making it over exciting. Umaine you can be exciting and not get hit. I mean that's what I try and teach my guys. You know, if you're getting hit, you're losing. Well it is an art form and it sounds crazy to call Marshall. I mean the, the term martial arts, it seems to a lot of people to be an inaccurate term or a term that doesn't seem to make sense cause it's fighting. But the artistic aspect of it is the performance. Like if you see a guy like Anderson Silva fight only flood Stephan Bonner, that was a beautiful artistic performance. It was art because he's creating on the spot he's created, he's putting, he's got this series of moves that his body knows how to do. He is techniques he knows how to utilize, but it's all about putting them together against an unwilling opponent in the middle of a competition in the middle of a cage where you're on broadcasting front of fucking millions of people worldwide and to pull it all off in this incredibly perfect way.

Speaker 1:          00:24:50       It's a work of art like definitely it's beautiful. You go and watch it over and over again. You could see it on TV, you'll see the highlights and it's just like watching a dance or not even a dance. I don't dance is not that impressive. No film, music, comedy. It's, it is art because it's an expression of your soul. You know? It's usually, I do really stress the art part. I want my athletes to express who they are, you know? I mean that that's what they're doing. That's the canvas of the octagon or the ring is that they're, they're little canvas too. I mean you get a chance to put to film in front of the world what you are, who you are, you know, cause the way you fight represents your personality. Yeah. And if you see those moments where a guy's hitting someone and can't be hit back like the famous video of Anderson Fighting Forrest Griffin where he's bobbing and weaving in front of him, forest has hitting an air and then Anderson cracks some like, like they're both fighting at two different speeds, two different frequencies.

Speaker 1:          00:25:52       Anderson's just in this complete different level. That's art. It's beautiful to watch. That's reminiscent, I watch a lot of old boxing. I Love Sugar Ray Robinson films and obviously reminiscent of the great Allie. I mean he, he could do things that other people can do. That's why that's what makes fighters special. You know, any fighter can sit there and get beat up. But I think that's why we talk about people like Silva Ali, you know, and now like I said, there's guys coming up in glory that are special. I mean even, you know, my favorite fighter, some of you guys might not know, uh, look up a guy named [inaudible] rune. Um, he's from sit your dog camp. He's one of my Moitai idols, but he's a WBC boxing champion. He dodged 13 punches and um, he, uh, w knocked a guy out with one

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       punch. It's s a m, a r t and look up 13 punches. I trained in timeline. It was why rob calm and was friends with them. But if we bring this video up, it is bad ass boxing. It used to be Moitai champ. He's probably one of the best ever and Moitai why he didn't get hit. But again, that style is able to dodge, move, evade, hit people, not get hit. And that's what makes striking fun. Yeah. Here he is right here. Yeah. Watch this gang. Look at this. This is my idol. If anyone wants to know who I love, I went to train in Thailand at his gym because of him. There's an that's amazing. That is beautiful. Bang and the fights over.

Speaker 5:          00:27:25       Yeah, that's, that's incredible. That's actually want to Anthony's idols to, and our couple of more guys really, uh, I have a vault. Are you, I mean, back in the day I didn't have TV. I didn't have an antenna, so all I did was watch VHS tapes. I've lived at my gym, so I watched fight Thai fights, Dutch fights, Japanese, like, uh, you know, how a good musician or any other artists' lives with their craft. That's how I mastered my craft. I watched fight after fight after fight after fight. That fight is a perfect example. That was art. Yeah. I mean I can find so many different fights like that. That's what I do. I send a lot of videos to all my guys. I send, I exposed them to. Um, one of my favorite compliments is when Alan Belcher fought, uh, uh, Patrick Otay, everyone goes, yeah. Mainly it looks like Yo turn Clyde fairtex hose.

Speaker 5:          00:28:13       And matter of fact, he studied Yo 10 Clyde to a t to I'll take a fighter and have my athletes study that for that particular game plan. And I'll see you're going to do this. Use this technique, you know, uh, a technique that Anthony and Serge have been doing is the hands thing kick a Sanchez or king star from Thailand. They're trying to land that. They're both, they're having a race. Who the hands? Yeah, we're the cartwheel the hands. Yeah. It's a cool move from [inaudible] the old school. But Sam Chai, s a. E. N. C. H. A. I um, he, he's a bad ass. He's from, from the Jackie. Jim. Hey, here's a good question. If you're doing a cartwheel kick, like say if you're standing, if you got one hand down, if our t and you're throwing a kick, are you down? Is that a downed opponent? They get let you get away with it and boy tie.

Speaker 5:          00:29:04       But I believe technically it is. So you're not supposed to be able to kick the guy in the face when you're a down. No, you're right. Ah, here we go, Bob. Yeah, look familiar guys. Yeah. But what I'm saying is like, say if he's thrown that kick, the guy who he's kicking can't kick him in the face when his hand is touching the ground. Yeah. Right. Uh, technically I believe so, but that's what you would want to do. You'd want to step in and kick him in the face and his hand soccer kick round. Anybody's on one limb. I think there, if you do that, that I don't, I hate an MMA when guys play the game, you know, touched I'm down. I'm not done. I'm done. I'm gonna explain

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       that for focusing on, no, you're not allowed to need it down to opponent. Like what a down deponent means is you can need a guy in the face when he's standing up, but once the guys on the ground, if he has a knee on the ground, uh, and one hand, as long as it's, as long as it's anything other than your feet on the ground, you can have one knee on the ground and you're okay. Right? You could need a guy in the face with one knee on the ground, but as soon as his hand touches three points, right? Yes. What it is. So what you'll see guys standing up and they'll reach down and just touch the ground just to keep from getting kneed in the face where you can, you can, you need a guy in the face when it, if he's got one knee and one leg.

Speaker 3:          00:30:20       No, no. The knee has to be up. The fee. They have to be up because you have to be honest feet only. Like if you get down to one knee, no, no hands, but one day you can't be a guy in the face. All right. Yeah. There's some weird rules, man. Well the, the, the 12 to six elbow, like you said, Thomas, stupid cause we could see some killer techniques. That's where we'd see even more Moitai elbows because then I would have my guys climb the old school Moitai and dropped the double elbows. I'm the the cage. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, definitely. Yeah, for sure. I mean I'm all about it. I love those techniques. Well, that technique is, that is really one of the most ridiculous rules ever. And the reason why it's in, for folks who don't know, the 12 to six meaning an elbow that comes from like the 12 o'clock down to six o'clock.

Speaker 3:          00:31:10       The reason why it's outlawed is because when they tried to get mixed martial arts past, they brought it to the athletic commissions and they said, well you can't have that one technique Coz I saw it on ESPN. There was a guy breaking bricks with it. No way you can allow people to do that because they could kill somebody. And so they went all right as if this has anything more powerful than this, which is probably more Po. No, I think when you're on the ground, the downward album was the most vicious drag. Do you get a fault? I think that like getting it, that's why another thing when Alan bead, Paula, Horace and the fight before that he beat Mcdonald on the Mat. We really been working on our ground and pound on our team. Um, cause it's another place to beat someone up. It's also so ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          00:31:51       You're not allowed to do with like a 12 six elbow to the thigh. Yeah. That's so crazy. Like if a guy's in your God you can't do a 12 six elbow to his thigh. It's just, it makes, if, if it were me, I'd love to have soccer kicks. Well do you think that soccer kicks though? They had him in pride and I liked it. I liked it. But what I don't think, I think in pride you were in a ring and you get your head could slip under the ropes. You can get away from stuff and the in the UFC that cage would like, you'd be mashed up if someone's soccer kicked your head. You're right, you're right. I forgot about that. Yeah. The problem is you can't move. It was an open space. Say if you fought, like say if every fight took place in like a basketball sized arena, like a basketball court was plenty of room to move around, but there's no cage. That would be really interesting. You know, it'd be really interesting if they, if they, if people fought like that because then take downs would be completely different. Getting back up would be much harder cause getting back up against the cage now has gotten to a real art form. Guys figured out how to press their back up against the cage and use it to stand back up and postop and get, once they get that under hook and they get one hand down there popping up like crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:33:04       No I, it's crazy. They're it guys are getting way better at wrestling. Way better at Jujitsu faster. Again, I think it's technology. There's so much knowledge out there. There's so much. I mean when I was trying to learn Moitai besides going to Thailand, watching videos, who was such a slow process, I remember my friends when they first like it was a big deal to have a blue belt around and Jujitsu and now it, you know, there's black belts everywhere and the knowledge is everywhere guys. So get a bravo. He has a site where he sent it out info and you can check out techniques and there's so much going on with that and just youtube and everything else. It's on TV too. You know how the kids learn how to play basketball in America on the playground. How do they learn how to play on the playground? They watch TV. You know, people are doing this stuff everywhere, whether they're in an organized school or just friends and their garage training, it's happening.

Speaker 3:          00:33:57       Well there's so much information now. Whereas when I was a kid, you would buy a book on a martial art or you know, you'd never, it was very rare that you would get a really good like VHS tape martial arts back then because when I was a kid I was training in the 80s I don't think there were any instructional martial arts tapes that I wasn't aware of. You had to go to a school, you had to go to a school and learn from somebody and then occasionally you would get fight videos and then you would watch, you know, try to emulate like Benny the jet, you know, like try to be like Benny the jet or Kitezh or you know, one of those guys. It was fighting back then. That was like really, really good.

Speaker 4:          00:34:31       My first, uh, instructional tapes I had, cause I, I still watch everything. I'm, I'm a student of the game was uh, a guy by the name of put bad noise. You mean his name's the golden leg. Five time Roger Down during champion and lived in France. That was my first Moy Tai Instructional. And I luckily got a chance to go train it as GM and in Paris. And then, uh, the other one was, I don't know if you remember the Chocker Riki [inaudible] Tom [inaudible] and you know, young Peter Arts is in there, Bronco sick it tick and Gilbert Valentini. So those are like my first kind of core hell cause I, 20 years ago this year, I went to Thailand. You want to hear irony though? A friend of mine, his name is Rambo, he fights MMA. He's, uh, one of the top one 15 ers in the world, but he's tie look up Rambo on r a m B, a Rambo Moitai. He's the crazy dancer. The first fight I ever went to. When I got the timeline, I took my bags rate to, to um, the hotel and I walked into [inaudible]. I walk in and he's

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       one of the main fights that night. Irony is, he fights them. I may now, it's just, I don't know. It's one of those weird destinies. The first fight card I see in Thailand is Rambod and now he's fighting and MMA. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean there's, you're finding for out of it, he lives in Japan. He, he, I think he fought you least Gomez at tachy. Yeah. Yeah. He fought. Uh, sorry. I was going to call them as a Eugene name. All my useless. What's up underground? I'm on there. I'm on there. Yeah, I know. I know. I see you on there. Yeah, it's a event. I know it's been a little shady on there lately. We're a lot of Douche bags. We got it. So it's not turning into that other thing.

Speaker 3:          00:36:18       Well, you know what it is, man. You can't, if, if it's on the Internet and anybody could sign up, anybody can sign up and if anybody gets signed up, you're just going to get a lot of shitheads. If people are anonymous, it's almost impossible to keep any forum completely clear of shitheads unless you just start banning people and then you worry about censorship and why are people banning? Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:36:37       I'm lucky. Everyone's really nice to me. Um, you know, it's cool. Uh, it's been a good time. We want bring up that video. There's a couple of them, maybe a highlight of them. It's Rambo highlight cause dude, he has his own little crazy style. He does the worm, he does the running man after his fights. He's really fun, entertaining Guy Ran Bob. His name literally means are crazy dancer. Now what do you think about

Speaker 3:          00:37:00       there's a, there's a thing going on right now where, uh, people are talking about this is him, what people are talking about this uh, past UFC, which I thought was great. I loved the mighty mouse fight. I love watching that guy perform, but that a lot of folks don't care to watch 125 pound fighters and they're saying, um, you know, there's a rumor on the underground, again, who knows if it's substantiated, but that the papers you buys were wanting some of the lowest ever for the UFC, um, that it was, uh, somewhere around a hundred thousand pay per view buys, which is really, really low for the UFC. Um, do you think that that's what it is? It Americans just do not want to see these little tiny guys?

Speaker 5:          00:37:38       I just think the timing was bad this time around. It was a few weeks coming off. Another big, uh, you know, fight. I think they, they should just drop a couple of the paper views per year. I mean, I'm no expert, but I like it when there's kind of a buildup for the paper, make the paper view the big bomber. And then we got all of our good free fights. You know, it's kind of like back in the day, remember Tuesday night fights on the USA. You've got some Friday night fights. He got some HBO and now we're going to have a big pay per view fight, you know, build it up. Just don't have pay for view fights. Just that paper view finder.

Speaker 3:          00:38:12       Yeah, it's definitely seems like there's a lot of fights going on. And you know, one hand it's great as a fight fan. Like on the 28th we were talking about this, there's two fight cards playing at the same time or the same day. One from New Zealand and then hours later, one from Texas, Jeremy Stephens is going to fight cub Swanson, great fight, fight, fight. Ooh, what a crazy fight that is. Stevens

Speaker 5:          00:38:35       is so fucking creative. You don't talking about a creative guy in there. Oh yeah. I'm a big fan of called, I really like what he's doing with his striking. Not only is he doing base kickbox and he's got some spins and he's honing his boxing as well. He's really, and I think that's like a big thing that a lot of people don't do because I think it's one of the hardest things to do. Um, I was talking to Rico, Verhoeven is fighting. Saturday he went and trained with uh, this guy, Tyson fury. And he said the first couple of times he went, I mean he just got lit up like a Christmas tree by cause that boxers, that's all they do. And that's like, um, if you go watch someone roll with Marcello Garcia and you're an MMA fighter, you're going to get crushed. You know, cause that's all Marcello does.

Speaker 5:          00:39:19       But I think it, that's always a cool thing. I love watching people humble themselves to get better. And that's how you get better. And cubs working with a worldclass champion level boxer and it's showing, well that's a real problem with a lot of fighters that especially if they come from a kickboxing background, they don't want to get tapped. So they don't want to do, they don't want to do Jujitsu. And they never learned. There's certain guys that never got good on the ground. They'd been doing MMA for 10, 15 years and there's still a God damn blue belt. I mean, they just doesn't ever got good on the ground. He never became lethal on the ground. And conversely, there's certain guys who are grapplers that just suck at standup. They always suck at stand up. They just, their whole game is predicated on getting a hold of you and turning into a grappling match.

Speaker 5:          00:40:03       But if it stuck standing up there helpless. Yeah, I've always looked at any fighting. Even if your kickboxing, you gotta know how to do every skill. I know some guys who don't want to train clinch at all. Well I don't clench. Well learn it so you don't get beat by it. I know a lot of guys who, you know, knees are stupid. I don't. Well, you got to learn. What are you going to do when someone else says knees are stupid that no come or anybody sees Niesr stupid needs to watch Travis Browne vs Alistair Overeem. I know Travis Browne survived that, but Jesus fucking Christ and Alice to take it to him when he to the body. Oh, a Bogan stoic. If you want to watch them, cool knees. He's fighting Saturday and the glory tournament he's got, he did this knee where he flew out of the ring.

Speaker 5:          00:40:47       There's a highlight if you bring up bog down bog, d a, n, a, s, t. O. I. C. I C I believe. Um, but he's, he's sick dude. He comes out with flying out of the Ray, went over the corner posts. He missed the knee and he got back up and whoop the guy's ass. Wow. Yeah, but he's going to be fun. He's fighting Wayne Baird who kinda has a wild ass wild. Yeah. Main Guy. I think the, yeah. Here it is. Check this. Look at this nice knee. We'll get that. He, he's fighting Saturday. Um, you know, just look at this pile that, that's the new age of what's going on with glory. Um, you know, a little bit different. Here we go. Wow. That's so crazy. Yeah. The dude went completely over the top madness. Oh, I know. I know. He was just laughing about it today when I was hanging out with him.

Speaker 5:          00:41:41       Yeah, he's okay. He could have broke a leg there. There's a wild fight in Thailand. Will bring you up in a second there and knocked him out. Look up. M D e n space. Monks are in m u a n G. S. U. R, I. N. Verse Rainbow. Boy. These ties have some crazy ass fucking oh yeah, yeah. Um, you're in the golden era. Moitai you spill it, grab the leg and run them across the ring. You can't do it anymore because too many injuries happen. And I'll show you the fight, why they can't, the cooling and the cage. You can still do it. But if this clip comes up that one more time. Den d e n Space Mung. Seron. M U. A. N. G. S. U. R I. N Verse Rainbow Though the Word Rainbow. Wow. And you could run across the ring. It was called the plow.

Speaker 5:          00:42:43       Now you can only take a step into half this fight. You'll see why the guy actually broke his back. Oh No. Yeah. This is insane. Yeah. Here we go. So a den is in the Blue Rainbow, some pump the lake. Do you know Greg Nelson, who from the Minnesota martial arts? Every, he actually used to train with, uh, some, some Pontalis camp. So yeah. Greg's a old friend of mine. Really good martial artist. So yeah, he trained with a [inaudible], uh, den monks ran, actually scrapped with Danny, Danny, Bill and, and uh, Ramon decker back in the day. So he, he's a class too. Wow. Watching high level ties. Yeah. This is a class that's an Olympic neath. I miss the old stadium. I was there in the 90s. Man. Somebody good fights. I got to see. I'm blessed. But uh, how long did you go to Thailand for? Um, I've been there like I'd go three months at a time.

Speaker 5:          00:43:36       The best thing I ever did honestly is, um, I was able to bring some of the top guys to come live with me. I used to have four guys from timeline living with me. And uh, it, it was awesome because I was able to plug in and extract all that information. You know, it was fun. Um, might have to fast forward a little till the, you see the end. These guys are gone off though. This is beautiful to watch. Yeah, it really good technique. Actually. Den also did some boxing for the Thai amateur team to Eh, you know, just uh, actually the logo you see on the right is Song Chai. If you're on Youtube, go to song tries channel. It's a killer. That was the biggest promoter in Thailand. He used to promote boxing Muay Thai. He's the one who promoted decker. Rob, our friend rob common.

Speaker 5:          00:44:22       Just uh, yeah, here we go. Here. Watch this doc bow, but check it out in Thailand. The bet. So much den monks in celebrating, he won. He won because he fell out of the ring. See, look at that. They're jumping for joy. They won the bet. So that's when they switched the rules a little bit in Thailand. Guy got fucked up. He broke his back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Check this out here. See I picked picks it up. Plow, jump, boom. We've got fucked up though. Yeah. The guy who's doing the plow got fucked up. Crazy. I know that it became illegal because the guy who we plowed didn't even get her. There was a few other incidents where they hit the ropes and bolts. Would flip and yeah, that's the thing. Timeline. Do you know I miss those days, those rules because of actually like the fights from, they call the golden era before 99, 2000, there was a better style of fighting.

Speaker 5:          00:45:16       Something may happen. The bedding change. Too many stadiums. Like everyone got into doing premiere league betting on that. Instead of going to the stadium, you know, it's premiere league soccer. They liked soccer more. It really hurt the economy or more time the economy went down and they can pay the athletes as much as well. Well now we'll knock. I Kim fell out of the ring like that. What happened? He shattered his back when he came back to fighting though. Really? Yeah. He healed up and he returned. He just broke a bone. Broken bone. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Probably a back rib backbone. Yeah. Crazy. Right. But it's crazy that that is the one that made it illegal because the guy who is executing that technique is the one that got hurt. Yeah. It's old school mean. Um, but no nice thing. And UFC, we get to see that you gauge the cage is much better because it stops guys from going out.

Speaker 5:          00:46:08       That was an issue in pride as well that would fall through the ropes. Guys would get caught up in the ropes and techniques. They couldn't defend themselves, you know, problematic. No, it's show. I used to like there was a ring, I think it was um, storm San Mariah I think are theory fighting from Brazil. The att or a Btt verse and the verse, the shoe box guys, is that when they had the net at the bottom right? Yeah. That was actually going out. Yeah. Those were insane. Like if you're just in the, you, you want some blood clause and a soccer kicks and stomps. Did you ever see Chuck Liddell versus Palae? Yeah. Yeah. That was back before chuck fought in the UFC, fought palae and in the real valley Tudo days where there was no rules, no gloves, no rules, no, no nothing. They're beaten the fucking shit out of each other and Paly, it was trapped in the net.

Speaker 5:          00:46:57       Like he was underneath the bottom rope, like stuck in the net. Chuck's beaten on them. Madness. The speaking to old school. I was in Cincinnati at the UFC. I made a Sean Shelby and Joe Shit civil laugh. Why lead Ishmael walked by and I seriously had to go, you know what guys like I scares me. Luckily I know him because our team's part of the Carlson Gracie team. He's, he's nice to me, but he's, that's one of the most ferocious like dudes have ever seen choked hoists. Gracie unconscious on the beach in Rio. They were telling me a story, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       some of the Carlson Gracie guys, how down he has for Carlson Gracie, the team. He was at a tournament in Brazil. He won, he got his elbow popped and um, some, uh, the, the loop delever guys storm the tournament and like, they're all challenged him and while he jumped up, he of course he's going to lead the charge while he goes, I'll take on every one of you efforts. But he couldn't straighten his arm. So it's fingers pointing that way. It's like armors is dangling there and he's still ready to go. What a tough sob. His, you know, he was tough as shit. You remember those recordings of him when he was mad at high and just telling the story about high end Gracie, somebody had a great video that they had online. It was on the underground of him explaining like the thing, you know, he had the thing he's called Gauher Geez chicken and he's doing with his accent describing high end.

Speaker 1:          00:48:29       It's a character now. Now. I mean luckily we both got the know Carlson senior. I was there at the end with Stephan. You trained with them. I mean it's that, that branch or the Gracie family man. Real deal. I mean, not that anyone else isn't. I'm just saying what they did to MMA. Yeah. Incredible. I mean, Vito Belfort, Mario Sperry, Marillo Bustamante the Noguera's thinking about all the different people that came out of that crossbar. Andre Punt and Eris Bonner, Stephan Bonner, Miguel Pinero she went out to be novel and Yao and level and yeah, it was the biggest for all the lightweight guys in Brazil. That's the biggest, toughest team. And as well, our friend Fabio Prado, who's with a, um, a Alpha male and our coach gain of underway to who lived with Carlson in Chicago. So like even it's part of the roof of sport team. It's just school. Actually Carlson junior has been coming up and helping out.

Speaker 1:          00:49:23       It's fun to see him. He is a great guy and he's, he's, it's cool man. He's a real MMA pioneer too. If you go back and watch his fights fighting. Oh yeah. Yeah, me the organization. It's been fun to, you know, again, I really like making all these new friends and everything I do, whether it's Jiu Jitsu, kickboxing, now I've got a lot of fun wrestling friends even, you know, I've, I mean, being exposed to the asking bro, aspirin brothers even. I have a friend Eric Jergens who's a really good Iowa wrestler that I met through Pat Miletich and, and um, that's the neat thing about combative sports. They're the, the, the camaraderie. It's, there's a special, a fraternity that I want to exchange for anything. Well, I think it's also these folks, first of all, they need each other. Like you can't get good at MMA without people to teach you and you need people to train with and they appreciate that.

Speaker 1:          00:50:16       And they also appreciate that there's very few people that understand them, like other martial artists do or other other fighters, you know, when they're training the lifestyle, the, the amount of effort that you to put in. Very few people understand or appreciate the dedication and commitment that's required to be a professional level MMA fighter. I mean, you can't have, you can't, there's no going out at night. There's no life. You don't have any lie. You might have a girlfriend and what do you do? You, you might watch a movie, get a little sex, and then pass out before your training. And that's it, man. You're not doing shit. You might get to go on a vacation after your fight, but guess what? Your, your amount of time you're actually relaxing is so small because if you did well in that fight, they're already talking about your next opponent.

Speaker 1:          00:50:57       So you start thinking about the next fight. And so you're on the beach somewhere and all you thinking about his fucking head kicks and tackles. And to me, finding reminds me of apocalypse now. We are in the bush. You think about being an rnr, but when you're out in the rnr, you just, you want to get back in the Bush because you don't want to get soft because Charlie's gonna come get you. You know what I mean? That's how I, that's how I would be like, fuck, I'm having a great time. Fuck off. Fuck does not now another dude, that's how it was for Anthony won the world title. It's like he was right back from the gym. Cause he knows some dude wants that strap. Like he wants to take what's his and, and yeah, it's, it's a really unique lifestyle. You know, it's very unique.

Speaker 1:          00:51:36       I mean, it's not unlike any other movie musician, comedian. You're only as good as your last show. Honestly. You're only as good as your last performance when w the spotlights I knew. But you got to love that. You know the special people like Anthony, Ben Askern, you know Alan Belcher, they're the type of dude, if it were the the final for the Ncaa Championship or give me the ball. I want to shoot it. Take to be a great fighter. You got to be that guy. You're the quarterback is like, I'm going to call the play coach. I got it right. It takes that special person to be one of the best and I love being around those people because a, it's empowering to watch them be that person. You know I I've love, it was actually funny in Anthony's, I'm fight with Serone, I want them to stay righty and he kind of stayed left.

Speaker 1:          00:52:27       He kind of, I was like the catcher and he was a pitcher waved me off like no. And I liked that though. I want my guys to quarterback their own fights. I don't want, if they have to count on everything, I say they're not ready to be champion. This whole Ben Astrin things are very interesting subject because Ben asked her and was a, who was a great wrestler, like elite amateur wrestler, got into MMA and shows dominance in the grappling that we have rarely ever seen before. And for whatever reason he gets labeled as being boring because of that. But you see what he's been able to do to guys like Lima, like these killers, you know, he takes these guys that normally, you know, they're, they're in the involve these crazy wild fights with people and he manhandled him. He gets a hold of these motherfuckers and he dragged him to the ground. He beats the shit out of him and for whatever reason, because he's not finishing guys or he's not finishing as many guys, and it's just a constant

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       state of frustration for one guy to be on the bottom and the other guy just getting ragdoll by asking over and over again, people label them in a bad way. Bella Tor didn't even negotiate two to reinstate his contract. He was there fucking champion. Now I had a real hard time with that. I didn't understand the logic behind that. Even slightly. They let him go as their champion. I thought that was completely stupid and crazy too. And then the UFC didn't even fucking pick them up because there was some weird shit there with them not wanting to pick up Bella tours guy and

Speaker 4:          00:54:00       well we did it with Hector Lombard. It's frustrating. Um, you know, it's really hard. I'm really good friends with Ben. He's doing great at one FC. They're taking care of him. You know, it's just, I want Ben to have a chance to put his legacy out there. I want to see him fight the best guys. His fucking grappling is ridiculous. He's more, he's moves are very unique. It is. I mean, I've seen him give high level black belts, fits it. Definitely mean he's, he's good and he just, you know, submitted his last opponent mean Ben is so good on the ground. He makes it look easy that people think he's not, you know, working hard. But I think he has a new focus is who's finished his last three opponents and this law. He likes getting out of there early now it's like, oh, okay, don't get paid for overtime. Yo. A lot of people won't realize he's third all time in the NCA at in pins. Wow. And he's one of two two time hodge trophy winners. The Heisman trophy or wrestling. So I think him and it was a Cael Sanderson. I'm very,

Speaker 3:          00:55:06       very impressed with that guys wrestling. And I was very upset that it didn't go down, that he didn't fight in the UFC. I was, when they were saying they were releasing him from Beltre and he was talking to people in the UFC. I was very excited. And there's a lot of people like, oh, he's boring. He's boy, I think. I think Jane has said Ben Aspirin is what ambien takes when it wants to go to sleep or I don't, I don't find them boring. I don't, I mean it, look, is it as exciting as watching Anderson Silva knockout Stephan Bonner with that knee to the body? No, no. It's not as exciting, but is a huge element of MMA. It's one of the biggest elements of MMA is grappling.

Speaker 4:          00:55:41       Was Damien Maia versus Anderson Silva tiding? No, no. Exactly. Not at all. No. What I watched boxing matches were two guys are supposed to beat each other up and it's a defensive stalemate and that's just sports sometimes, you know, sometimes. Um, and this is going to be the greatest super bowl and it's boring.

Speaker 3:          00:55:59       The last May where the fight was one of the most exciting fights he's ever had versus my Donna is because it came, became a brawl that's not an Mayweather fight. Mayweather fights are fights, three boxes, guys faces off and then it goes away. Like the Canelo Alvarez fight wasn't particularly exciting. No means you just sort of boxed him outboxed him, moved around them.

Speaker 4:          00:56:18       Definitely. I mean, I, I, I hope then in the next year or so gets a chance

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       to show him he and I, I think the, the welterweight division is kind of wild. Placers. I mean, yeah, we got Johnny Hendricks is a champ, but I mean, Robbie Lawler lost a close fight to him. Eh, there, there it's, it's scary how close it is right now. Yeah. And Robbie Lawler just looked sensational, knocking out Jake Ellenberger him. He looked like a fucking murderer. Then Rory Macdonald just looked outstanding and it's tiring. You got Hector Lumbar, who's fucking ridiculous. I mean, who is faster or more athletic than Hector lumbar and he hits those fucking judo throws on high level guys to see Jake shields go flying through the air on a hip toss like that. It's like Jesus Christ. I, I just know who I'm the happiest for. Robbie. I've known Robbie for a long time through Pat Miletich and man, that guys work so hard to evolve, adapt, change and grow.

Speaker 5:          00:57:17       I don't care what people say. You can teach an old dog new tricks. It's all comes down to attitude. I think, uh, one of my favorite quotes by Zig Ziglar, it's not your aptitude that determines your altitude. It's your attitude. And he has the right attitude. He made the changes. I mean, he got way better at grappling. He's, and he's so disciplined. I mean, what a comeback story. The other comeback story at one 72. How about Matt Brown? Uncredible. Yeah. I mean, when people say they can't get better, won't, don't want, or sometimes when my guys get upset, if they lose a fight, then Matt Brown yourself, you know, pull yourself out of the be the Phoenix that came out of the fire. Just work hard and at the right attitude. Matt Brown was submitted by Seth Bazinsky just two years ago. You know, people don't forget, they forget about some of the fights that he's had where he lost the look.

Speaker 5:          00:58:07       If you are, if you can still move correctly, if you don't have a debilitating injury, if you don't have cognitive problems, you have been hitting the head too many times. You can still learn. You could still grow. But some guys, they do not do that because they're very stubborn in their ways or they're stuck on there. They're on a path there. They're stuck on that path and they never develop. And it's unfortunate. It really is unfortunate because the beautiful thing about MMA is the fact that there's so many options. And when you see a guy get to a high, like a mighty mouse, like a Demetrius Johnson who gets this incredibly high level of aptitude and all these different areas, it's a beautiful thing to watch, man. So I'd love to his fight, honestly, I thought he did a great job of using his Moy Thai style clinch to negate wrestling used knees.

Speaker 5:          00:58:50       Well, I mean it was, he reminded me of a mini Anderson Silva and that aspect using the clinch. I enjoy that type of fighting. Uh, I think Matt Hume is an incredible coach, one of the best. Yeah, I mean a great guy. And, and I, I really enjoyed his performance. I mean, um, you know, sometimes people are just into the heavyweights. I mean, I like watching smaller fighters fight personally myself because there's much more going on. Not saying I don't like heavy weights, but I mean, you know, it just in general, you know, it's small than that. Good. Well then what are you guys going to think of 115 pound chicks white and, yeah, I mean, well that's coming and we were just talking about that. Oh yeah, division is going to be the next division in the UFC. Excuse me, the Straw Weight Division for women for one 15.

Speaker 5:          00:59:38       It's exciting. I'm going to be, uh, assisting Anthony Pettis on the ultimate fighter. I'm only going 10 days and then I come back a little later. Um, I want to Anthony to shine as a coach. People don't realize he's a really good teacher coach and these really competitive, he'd knocked his baby daughter off the chair to win if it were musical chairs. I mean he, he is the type of guy he likes to, you know, a couple of our, last summer we had a pickup basketball game. Oh my God. It just turned into something we'll funding thing on. He looked like Jordan going for the third ring. It was just like every rebound, every, this kid wouldn't stop it. We had so much fun. I mean, but you know, when you do things like that, casual games, you, you find out what certain guys are made of, you find out how crazy they really, oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:00:26       We, there was two, there was, there was 10 alphas playing basketball. Not a smart move, but that should probably be banned from the, the, the fight contracts. No basketball. Yeah. Right. What is banned? Can they ride motorcycles? They're allowed to ride motorcycles and things in our band. Right. I believe they can. I'm not sure. I don't handle the management side of our stuff. I know that, uh, Anthony has a proud owner of his Milwaukee Harley Davidson. He won for his title. Does he ride a little bit? Not Too much. So, yeah. I mean that's why I don't drive sports cars or motorcycles cause I'm that idiot who wants to see how fast they can go there. That's why, that's why I fight. You know, that's where I get my adrenaline out. I would worry more about the other drivers. Yeah. With a motorcycle. My Dad's youngest brother, my uncle actually got hit by a glass truck, um, motorcycle and he fell and didn't have a helmet on cause and he's had many issues because of it.

Speaker 5:          01:01:25       But yeah. And I mean unfortunately every year or two I lose her friend in Wisconsin. It's just such a culture there. Live to ride, ride to live, you know. But we have such potholes. And the other thing I've done I never understood is jump on your bike and go to a bar and start drinking. Yeah. You know, that's uh, you know, people bar hop. What's crazy? The bars of parking lots. Yeah. Yeah. Not a lot of drink and drive, but it's a bunch of people drinking and there's a bunch of cars. Hey, wait, there's less people in the bar then there, where's the designated, wait a minute is not enough. Deadheaded drivers. It's not possible. Now it's uh, you know, it's gold. Uh, I, I, I can't handle the, the motorcycle culture. I love it, but I'm the guy who will test my limits. Well, I'd started trying to get my motorcycle license. Me and a few friends that were working on fear factor. Lot of the guys in production.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       We all signed up for motorcycle safety classes. We started learning how to ride. We did all the thing. I got a helmet. And then during the time where I was learning three different people I knew, well one person saw, she saw a guy get hit by a motorcycle and two friends got fucked up. Frank Mir got his leg, he got t boned by a car. A guy ran a red light, slammed into him, broke his leg, sent him flying like 60 feet through the air. And if it wasn't for the fact that he's this giant heavyweight, he probably would have been paralyzed for life mean to it. Amazing that he came back to fight and, and, and become good again. Actually approved. Yeah. And then another friend of mine, uh, Edson fell down. It tore his shoulder apart. He was going around a turn and to pikes, slipped out from under him at boom, hit his shoulder on the ground, mangled his shoulder.

Speaker 1:          01:03:11       Dude, crazy for my friend cognitive path who used to live with me. I'm from Thailand. Deets down here in the states. Really killer dude. And he was for time, Roger Number and she stadium champ. He went back home to Roy yet northeast Thailand and his motorcycle. He had all souped up. He got in a motorcycle accident, his ankle got bent back the other way. And the accident, that was after his first title. He went on to win three more championships and go outside Thailand and fight with that ankle. He'd be like rib randomly holding pads at the gym and you just fall down like Kong. What's the problem? Oh, jet mark. My ankle like hurts bad. I'm like, it would just give out on him. Yeah, man. I'm like, how the thought? Yeah. That's incredible. I know. I mean, it's uh, you know, motorcycles or, you know, if you've ever been to timeline, you've probably seen a family of five on one. It's crazy. It's like they can fit a family of five on a little one 25. Well, if everybody was riding motorcycles like in Thailand back in with less cars, probably safer.

Speaker 4:          01:04:10       Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the traffic's so bad. So they go in between and uh, you know, taglines crazy though. It's a, it's a fun place, but a crazy place. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:21       Yeah. How did Thailand get so many ladyboys? What happened there? I don't understand, but it's the Thai culture is so, um, tower.

Speaker 4:          01:04:32       Yeah, like the Buddhist religion. It's um, my pen lie, which means don't worry, it doesn't matter culture. But yeah, I don't, it scares me because I used to train it a state you're talking when I first went and you know, I'd go to the beach on the weekend and you know, all these chicks, weird looking chicks, hey, 60 men, I'm like to my friend, man, these chicks really dig us man. Hey Yo, text week this guy in a walker, hey 60 man. I'm like, wait a minute. I think their whole Cursio but point being then that you can spot

Speaker 1:          01:05:05       them a mile away. Your Adam's apple. When you said that the big Adam's apple boy, they spite them to Mike cause some of them you can't spot a mile away. So very, very, very feminine. Yes and no. I mean they look like the other

Speaker 4:          01:05:17       Thai women. I mean,

Speaker 3:          01:05:19       ah, I see. Say you can tell. Oh at least, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, but it's fascinating that this one culture, it's just known for ladyboys. Yeah. And that it's a normal part of, like, I had a buddy who went over there and was drinking Brody Stevens. Brody Stevens told a great story about it and we determined that he was 84% gay sex. He started off at that he was 10% gay and a we, by the end of the conversation we've worked at that. He was somewhere over 50 definitely over 50% gay, but he told the story about a meeting ladyboys there and you know, just having a good time and enjoying it. It didn't feel, didn't feel abnormal because he was there in a culture where it's normal and it's accepted. There was all these other people that, you know, even guys that were like, you know, straight guys were hanging out with these ladyboys because it was just how they did it over there.

Speaker 4:          01:06:08       Not me, not me. I just know what, I never really partied much in Thailand because I was always training. One trip I've had little fun, but I mean like it's just weird. The one night my wife went to Thailand with me once we were on a took, took late night in Bangkok crews and back to our hotel after some fights. And uh, we were right up to the dude and we totally see this guy mash and kissing with total. This, the Adam's apple. Both my wife and I were like, oh,

Speaker 3:          01:06:42       oh if the crying game going on, oh maybe that's what he likes. Yeah. But hey whatever, whatever floats your boat, man. Whatever floats your boat. Thailand's a a wild place and all sorts of other ways too, right? I mean it's like prostitution is rampant. There's Moy Thai fights in bars. It's just, it's a wild, wild place.

Speaker 4:          01:07:01       Why this thing I saw in Thailand was I'm going to the temple fights or like church festivals on the weekend and they line up all the kids and they put them in a line and there's no scale. They just used to you too. You too. And then their families like all cause some go to camps and someone just trained with their families and then they all bet on their kids, man. Wow. And you see like kids getting elbowed and lily and then own the music speeds up in the little kid. He kicked the shorts are way too big yanking him up. You know, it's just like, I consider myself kind of a tough dude, but I, I don't like watching the little kids scrap down with elbows and I'm like, Hey, you know, I have a daughter and everyone's like, cause she gonna fight. And I'm like, maybe, I don't know. I mean like fighting isn't for everybody. You know what I mean? No one time at one of the other camps I was at, this kid had just come from way northeast Thailand and um, he just wasn't sleeping well at night. He was used to eating different and one of the trainers, you know, sometimes the trainers drank a lot cause they get the shit kicked him up out of pads. They're all former fighters, you know, like live at the gym with you. And so they just, they're little well

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       being beat up and when they crack the shit out of the kid to shut up, you know, like they just, you know, just basically a little toughen up session at midnight. You know, it's just little things you see you don't like. I love Thailand, but I don't think it's healthy to send a kid away at nine years old to become a boxer. No. You know what I mean? Like some of the guys I brought over from timeline, I had to teach them things about life that they didn't learn when they lived at the Moitai camp. You know, it's not normal to go live in a, basically what a white I camp is a modern day. Lewdness it's a gladiator school. You know what I mean? I love more eye to eye in a lot of it not, and please don't make it seem like I'm trying to put it down.

Speaker 1:          01:08:57       It's just, you have to understand what it is. It's a third world country. It's not martial arts, it's a boxing gym. It's, it's professional horse racing. They're there to make money for the camp. 50% of their earnings go to the camp and then the rest of their money they try and send back home to their family. Something that folks don't realize too. When you hear like bullet crop, a little book I'll pour promote. Yeah, that's his name is one thing. The Gym name is the name that he takes on. That's not even his real name at all. It is is he has a boxing name. Wachau boycott means uh, cows white and boy is lotus. So it's the White Lotus. And then poor promote is, uh, he's a student or promote, promote is the boss of the camp. So he has a real name and then that's essentially his nickname.

Speaker 1:          01:09:49       I forgot his last name starts with a B, but it's real name is somebody that's his passport name. Yeah. All the boxers get a different name. You know the of your boxing name and, yeah. So it's the White Lotus. Yeah, that's what his name means. Cool. His nickname actually is dom, which means black cause he's so dark. Oh No, it's messed up in Thailand, dude. Like I think they got good skin tone. We're trying to get tanned going, running with them all. You can tell all the boxers running. They got hats on. They got long sleeve tee shirts and long shorts on because they don't want to get tan cause it's frowned upon to be dark skinned in Thailand. Really? Yeah. Yeah. It's like if you're dark skinned, you're, you, you, you're from the country. You work in the fields, you know, that's what's going on with the Philippines.

Speaker 1:          01:10:33       Yeah. That sucks man. They're using glutathione and glutathione somehow or another. Uh, it's an antioxidant, but somehow or another, I think they inject it or something. I don't know what they're doing, but they're doing it to, uh, to, to lighten their skin color and it's become a very common treatment and hear you. And I want to be tamed. I liked being, I want my vitamin D. I want, you know, it's messed up, man. It's not only that Steve Maxwell who, uh, has been on the podcast several times told me that vitamin D levels actually when you have vitamin D from Sun, that it actually has an anabolic effect on the body. It helps your body recover. It helps develop and build muscle. Like there's a lot of positive aspects to having vitamin D.

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       I've, I mean, the hardest thing about where I live is a tough winters, you know, from being from the Boston area and the last couple weeks I've had some pep in my step, man, I, you know, the sun's out. I'm feeling better, I'm working out better. You know, it's, I believe you. I mean, a trick that I do because I struggle a little bit with seasonal depression, our whole Gmu been, there's painted super yellow, it's in a basement. I do it the trick myself psychologically and my students. So you can't tell how dreary it is outside. And then another trick they say to do in the winter is don't wear your sunglasses out. The best vitamin D comes to your pupil. So right away while you're outside in the winter and it's sunny out, what that vitamin D come through your pupil. It's this, that's the only way because it's not strong enough to touch your skin in the winter when you live in winter areas.

Speaker 5:          01:12:03       But yeah, I'm a firm believer in vitamin D Sun. Um, I'm really into the elements of life. Water is so important. Sun, the wind, you know, in the stars. So like it's very revitalizing all those things. That's one of the stars. Like a good starry night dude gives you like a feeling like your body. Like wow. That's why I love my wife is from central Wisconsin and I love going out into the woods and just chill in and he would go out and there's lakes. It's just so beautiful. That's, you know, looking up the stars, fresh air. I mean, it's uh, it's so important to connect with nature actually. Like in Vegas, every sex, how are you going to a party? Go crazy. I'm like, no man, we're going to go hiking. My wife and I are going to go hiking every morning at 6:00 AM, we're gonna stand Milwaukee time, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:12:48       Well that's our, I like going out into the mountains, red rock, go up the Charleston, you know, do that. I mean, you know how it is older, you get a been there done that bought the tee shirt, you know, it's pretty old. Well, a lot of fighters have a real problem with without, when they live in Vegas too. And the ones who tend to do best are the ones who avoid this trip and do things like a little like me, maybe do a little jet ski, maybe go hiking, maybe go fishing, do something where you're getting out of the Vegas, Vegas and getting into the Nevada. Yeah, for sure. State I've been going to Vegas and so I was 18 for fights. So am I. The first fight I went to was at the, at the sands. That's how old I am. And, and I just, I'm, and even, it's weird.

Speaker 5:          01:13:34       I, I uh, when I trained in Vegas, I used to train that master toddies and he had all these really killer trainers from Thailand and they would all laugh at me. They're like, Duke, you're not like, I, I be home on the weekend. They're like, you're not going out. I'm like, no, I want to win. I go run on Sunday. They're like, you're not going out. Like, I dunno, I has everyone else who's come here before done that. They're like, yeah. So that's why they gave me so much attention. I was so disciplined that like for me, I know I'm not the most gifted and talented guy, so I'm the person now I'm having the time of my life. I, I have a ball. You know what? I try and tell all my fighters, all you fighters, man, dude, like Joe and I were, we're in our forties and we're having the time of our life.

Speaker 5:          01:14:18       It don't like it. It's a number. Doesn't change how you live. You know? I keep going after competition. Yeah. I mean I have more fun now doing everything than I did when I was a fighter. I was pretty boring when I was a fighter, you know? Like I said, I just hang out. I became a movie buff comedy buff because I watched that. That was my hobby, you know? But Dude, you can't, you can always party. You can always chase girls. You can always eat bad food. You can always do drugs. Whatever you want to do. After fighting, you can do that, but you only have so many years. You know what I mean? You have a, you have a lifespan to be great and that's, that's what I preach to my guys. Cement your legacy and then have some fun and it's also important to take it into perspective.

Speaker 5:          01:15:04       Like there's guys that are super talented, they're supernaturally talented and it doesn't take much and they can, you know, there's guys who were champions are notorious for not working out very hard, but you know what comes along like say like guys who don't train in between fights, they just sorta hang out somewhere. You know what comes along? Somebody who's exactly like you but disciplined. Yeah, exactly. And those guys are out. Those perfect storm athletes are out there that are really physically talented, really mentally talented, very strong, very creative and super disciplined and hungrier. Man, you know, that's, to me the person who wants it is who wins the fight. The one, the person who wants it, it just doesn't start on fight night. It starts all year rum. The guy who trains all year round wants it more than the guy who doesn't. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and there's so many examples now that you could look to as far as, one of the most important things about martial artists is learning from past martial artists, learning from their techniques, emulating techniques as you were, you were talking about before with Belcher and a lot of different fighters and this is like the greatest time ever to have that opportunity.

Speaker 5:          01:16:10       Like do you know what sugar ray Robinson would have given to have, be able to see a sugar ray Robinson on video before him to be able to study films? There's no, what did you see? He saw some grainy Jack Johnson footage. Exactly know. That's Kinda like, I would say that's the, you know, like in basketball, you know, people who change the game. I would say it was first it was Bob Cousy, then pistol Pete, doctor j Jordan and then maybe Lebron now. But like those game changing the athletes and boxing, who would it have to be? Jack Johnson, first athletic moving guy, sugar ray Robinson, who I still watch and study. That is the blueprint of the greatest of all time. Muhammad Ali, of course it's a ram dog man. Duran Duran is like one of my favorites because the youtube cause like my family, I remember we read that paper view fights.

Speaker 5:          01:17:03       My Dad has five brothers. I got five brothers who'd be crazy. Like everyone would be on one side of the, you know, Duran over here, Leonard, you know, I got to meet Ray Leonard to my brother and know him. He's a great guy. But I, I didn't like Leonard. I W I was a blue collar type guy. I was a Hagler and Duran guy cause I was a hard worker. So I related to, you know, Duran and Leonard wasn't a hard worker, but everybody had this opinion of him as they'll be this glamorous. Sure. Ready boy, you know, showing up with, you know, like a beautiful girl and mink coat. That's the, the idea that you thought of when you thought of it. Leonard, the golden boy from the Olympics. Meanwhile, pretty fucking hard work. Oh No, it ray ray was, man, I got to hang out with ray a couple times and he's cool.

Speaker 5:          01:17:50       Rarely cool. And He loves martial arts. You know, he, you know who his idol is. Uh, Bruce Lee, he came out, um, when I think the, it was either when he fought Donnie little blond or when he fought Hearns the second time it was cold fight and Caesar's, he came out in the Kung Fu suit, not the yellow and black, but the traditional black, you know, style. Oh yeah, dude. He used to train a little bit June Rhee to really, yeah. Interesting. Yeah. I mean, uh, knows it. Speaking of, um, you've got Bruce man, you know, it's, people just don't realize how awesome he was. Yeah. Just like member was the first armored a movie. It was enter the Dragon. Right. And then that, then you have, um, a Kareem Abdul Jabbar and the head arm triangle and game of death too. I think he did. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, just, you know, it just crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:18:48       Just, I'm huge, like kind of, I love the guys who kind of shake it up because actually even one of my mentors in Thailand, crew get tongue. He had a different style of Moitai that wasn't necessarily the same or the other gym. I liked a lot jockey Jim, they're, they're not the norm. And, and I, I like finding the innovators, you know what I mean? It's fun cause th that's the, you know, it's like what would we do without Steve Jobs, you know? I mean what he, I want my goal, like with what I'm trying to do. I want to be an apple type product that changes people's lives with martial arts, you know? And uh, I just, every day I try and think of like, we were trained around, kicked today. My probably show you something a little different every time. I'm trying to like innovate. Yeah. Even the simplest move, you know what I mean? Cause that's time is what makes techniques happen. The faster you can splice the time that, that, that technique locks on or Wayans is how you win a fight. We're also the, the various aspects of the techniques that allow you to avoid counters, sales to doing it one way. You don't avoid the counter, you know, those all those little subtle aspects of striking that are lost on some folks. Yeah. I think that's why it's good. The watch like um,

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       those, uh, the UFC shows on Fox where they break down the fights after the fight. Dominic Cruz is really good at that. Really good at breaking down. We're fighters made mistakes. Like a good example is the Conley Rich Franklin fight when you're only knock Franklin out with a co with a punch. We caught Franklin straight up coming straight out. I'm not moving the head off the center line. How many fighters do you see that are really talented? Great fighters, but they don't get with a good camp. They don't leave their comfort zone, their surroundings. They might start out with some gym that has limited trainers, but they're talented themselves. They get to a certain level, but then they can sort of stagnate and they fucking, they get fucked because of it. Really?

Speaker 5:          01:20:46       Yeah. I mean, it's like any other sport, you know, you got to go to the right college and basketball, baseball to get selected to go to the NBA, NFL major leagues. You know, it's unfortunate. I know everyone has their Cinderella story. I mean, I, one of my students is fighting Saturday, he's from Marshalltown, Iowa. He moved to Milwaukee and his careers blossom because of he's fighting for the world series of fighting title. Uh, the featherweight Rick the gladiator, Glenn, great kid, man. Atlanta, incredible winning streak and his game has gone up x exponentially. There's a nice fight to his on an MMA junkie today. Um, he knocked the guy out in the world. Great Kid. And that's, it's hard. You've got to leave home. Something's got to be on TV. Yes. I believe NBC. And who is he finding? Um, oh, Alexi, the hoods, the good Russian kid.

Speaker 5:          01:21:34       I forgot how to say his last night. I got damn good. Rough number. Risky is there. They know how to fight, man. They are not regular white people. No, no, no. Off. How many knees did he take from mighty mouse? Oh, like a hundred, a hundred knees in the face now. Crazy. That guy just ate him. He ate all those knees. Speaking of Russians, I like, we were talking about him earlier. Um, so stoked. Um, about this tournament are 10, 11. Oh yeah, yeah. He's got a, a cool style fighting. I'm not picking his style over anyone. What I like about him, he's a [inaudible] stylist, but he's also good at boxing and, but no, it's funny you're going to love her because you're a social media guru is during his fights. He's tweeting during the fight. He's got someone a and is his Twitter feed. It's awesome.

Speaker 5:          01:22:23       But the, there's a, he's awesome though. He's a cool, he's going up against that Pereira from Brazil who like this guy, he trains in the mountains that I think there's a cool video on youtube, maybe a Alex Perrera. He's a native Indian from Brazil and he channels all I spell Perrera for g. E. R. R. I. E. R. A, I believe. Um, maybe had glory into that too. But yeah, there's a cool video of him training up in the mountains, but he's a former boxer and he did take Wando. She's got a sweet turning sidekick. Uh, yeah, he, he, he was not the fan favor are the favorite fighter to win the middleweight Turner. But this dude's tough. He beat a lot of good. But um, I like loving a lot, eh? Eh. Here, check it out. This is him. He's getting ready for the eight man tournament this weekend.

Speaker 2:          01:23:13       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:23:14       Look at this.

Speaker 5:          01:23:20       He's really in tune. He fight. Who was he fought so far in glory? A fight. Tyron spa. No, he's awake. Class lighter. But uh, he beat a really good guy from Mike's gym in the final, uh, oh. I know who he fought. He fought no, in his last fight, he knocked somebody out with a left hook. Oh, I'm Jacoby. Yes. Yeah, yeah. He, yeah, he brings it, man. That was a nasty left talk to and Jacoby's toughest shit, man. Yeah. And how about Melvin Manhoef is going to be in this tournament today. That's another guy that scares me. I'm like, Hey, Mike passenger, can you put his collar? I'm pleased there's a dark color. The ring. Excuse me, Mike, can you take them back to the gym? You know, he's walking around. I'm like, I think my goal over here, that is one of the wildest guys that has ever fought in anything.

Speaker 5:          01:24:10       Melvin Manhoef is a wild motherfucker. Oh yeah. I mean, there's just, I've trained in, in Amsterdam and there's just a unique crate. Yeah. There's just a unique craziness. His walkout out, you got to get this real Couto his walkout where Mike is this firing them up. They know what Mike says to God. God Damn for him at work. Oh yeah. Him and bought her Howery to animals and uh, they got Saki too. Yeah, it's crazy. I'm having a lot of fun with the glory Gig. Um, I'm real thankful to have the opportunity to kind of expose people to just stand up. It's fun. I mean, you know, coke ups finding this weekend, he's on the, he's on the prelims. We also got a really good kid from Thailand. He's only 19 years old with 106 fights. Watts. Yeah. 19 with 106 fights I was hanging out with is just gentle as a lamb.

Speaker 5:          01:25:11       Nice little kid. I mean, he's just that little baby face killer. Jesus Christ. And when you say cro, cop's in the prelims is the aired prelims. Yeah. Yeah. It's on Spike TV free. So yeah, that's our warm up to the paper view. Now, hey, I got to tell you, normally these guys are kind of reserved, but a Rico, very human and Daniel Guid or going at each other on Twitter. Um, they've been good. I think Geeta has been calling a Rico. They call him the prince a kickbox and he's the princess. He's going to steal his Tiara. And then, you know, uh, [inaudible] has been going off about, he says he's the number one of, you know, in the rankings. He's like, well, you know, you're the number one shit talker. And I mean, they, the bolt of them today. I've never seen European guys this animated. I mean, they're there.

Speaker 5:          01:25:56       They fought. Yes. And very controversial fight, right? The first one, Rico won the tournament. There's that kind of controversial knockdown with a Saki, which he pushed the RAF and he didn't get cut from a glory for that Saki pushed the raft down. Right. Yeah. We'll, we'll talk about that subject later. But now that, then he beat a keyed in a close decision. Geeta thinks he won. Geat has come back and knocked out two big wins off. Yeah, he looked really good and now, you know, very moving bead arts. He just had his first pro boxing fight though. Very haven. Teddy Riley. He's been training with Tyson fury and really working on it. He fought boxing really recently. It has seven weeks ago. I was a lot of guys and Gloria are moonlighting. Nikki, uh, Holtz can, he's been pro boxing marked a bone to funding a bazooka.

Speaker 5:          01:26:51       Joe Van Hel to Leni Veltin Leni is fun to watch and fun to watch. Yeah. Raymond Daniels was a awesome, yeah, fine. I, I'm big fan of Raymond, but he did exactly what you're supposed to do to do. Can we get that fight up there? Raymond Daniels and Bazooka Joe and debunk. Is that for the title? Yeah, it's for the title. Yeah, the bone just beat a carpet care patching in Denver. Yeah, very technical. I mean, uh, carpets are really super smart fighter. Both technical and Karpov was really coming on those last rounds too, which is interesting. Um, no, like the bone, he throws some jump kicks. He does the jump, scissor kick. A lot of cool moves, jump fly knee. But you know, Bazooka Joe, he reminded me if I did do, just describe who Bazooka Joe is. He's the arterial Gaudy of a kickbox Canadian Italian scrapper. But here you can see it stayed on the legs.

Speaker 5:          01:27:46       Nicely dissected. But when after the high kick, that's all she wrote. Mama Mia, you know, it was beautiful. Yeah. That was beautiful. He's only got 11 pro fights and he went toe to toe with Nikki Holt's can, you know? Yeah. And was hanging in there until the end. Yeah. And the final round. But that was also a fight where he fought that fight before. Exactly. I mean I think, I think Bazooka Joe was going to be tough to beat in the single fight format. I got to tell you, I don't particularly like the, the tournament format because I think it's unfair if a guy has one fight early and he knocks the guy out in the first round where's his opponent might have to go a fourth round because the three rounds of gone to a draw. I think that's crazy to have those two guys fight afterwards.

Speaker 5:          01:28:28       I know it's kind of exciting, but I don't think it's fair to the athletes. I, I, I've loved that Gloria has done our five round title fights. It's just been magnificent because we see the art of fighting. We really do. Um, the tournaments are, are there a cool spectacle for the fans who want to see the blood and Gore, but the technique and the art of strategy, I think we see that in a title fight. Yeah, no doubt. No doubt. There's been some gray great fights too in the last, uh, the lightweight division fight that last fight with um, uh, the, the uh, Kachin. Oh yeah, yeah man. Cause Rusty was coming off those two big wins over Giorgio Oprah Petrosyan, which is a huge upset. Oh yeah. Petrosian who is like one of the greatest ever. Yeah, definitely. He was up to that point, considered the Mayweather of our sport and uh, you know the glory.

Speaker 5:          01:29:23       That's the crazy thing. The parity. That's what, what I love about the kickboxing. The fights are so evenly matched and this is Rusty's first fight back. Yes. Glory card this weekend he's fighting in the tournament, right? Yeah, he's actually fighting Chi Hollenbeck. Um, the spike TV broadcast too. So that's another tasty fight for fans. Not a tournament fight. Not to fight on, on Spike TV. There's going to be a four man, a featherweight tournament and that, that's going to be a really good, you've got a Yo yo come poon sit chai from Thailand, the 19 year old with 106 fights. Uh, Gabriel Varga, who's a really lifelong martial artists. I like this kid style a lot. He's good at kickboxing, incorporate spin kicks, he can punch. He has a fun style. He's a lot of fun to watch. Uh, and you got Marcus vis a vi Venetia's excuse me, from Brazil as well.

Speaker 5:          01:30:16       So it's going to be a tasty tournament. So that's the tournament. And then receives fighting Hollenback a single fight. And then cro cop is fighting Terrelle Miller. She has a win over Pat Barry in the world combat league and he fought cro cop, I believe in the k one last year. The that whatever's left the K one. Um, but everyone thought GRL one, so I didn't, I watched the fight. I, I could have saw it that way too. It was in Croatia. So I was going to cro cop's making this resurgence as a kickboxer. Yeah, it was pretty cool atmosphere in Zagreb when he fought. I mean, I thought he'd beat Remi. I did too. Yeah. Rentable. And Jessica was another great fighter who's been around the block a long time. He's been actually, uh, no, it's really cool. Is on the broadcast isn't, yeah, they're bringing in Stephen Quatros a microscope vow and remi, we're going to have some extra kind of like you, you're talking about the UFC is doing the extra analyst and breaking things down.

Speaker 5:          01:31:17       So we're going to have a fun and it will be run crock and I in the booth, Luke Thomas, we're going to have a lot of fun with this broadcast. Uh, I'm having a ball doing this cause I, what I like doing, like what you do at the UFC is let people behind the curtain, you know, it's different. People kind of understand punching boxing. That's a jab across a hook. It's martial arts. There's a little bit more detailed to it, not taken away from boxing. And we need to have that time and room to explain everything because there's a little bit more going on with the kicks, the knees and some of the sweeps trips and obviously in Jujitsu and wrestling, a lot of minute details that make a big difference. Yeah. And there's also people can relate to what it feels like to get punched.

Speaker 5:          01:31:59       I don't, there's like we're saying about leg kicks things people don't understand. They just don't, they people who judge fights unfortunately don't understand. We have a real problem with Matt. I remember the first, uh, I was at that fight. UFC One oh four. A shogun versa. Machida owed him a shitty yeah. And he kicked the shit out of his legs and he didn't win the fight. And someone, one of the judges actually said leg kicks, don't finish fights like the fuck are you talking about? Are you just ignorant to history? Because I'm both times I broke into guys likes with leg kicks size on the femur. I, I fought Mitchell Holla in 1996 and Australia, I think it was kicking heart. He broke his, the Tibia, he stopped on the stool because it was blocked wrong. So broke that. And then Pat Smith, I kicked him on the back leg and I cracked the bone right above raped by the knee joint there.

Speaker 5:          01:32:53       So yeah, it's uh, I like, I liked the like kick a little bit. Leggings are awesome. I'm sorry. I mean, it's a great feeling to know that you can do that to someone. There's something, I don't know. I, I, I've always told my guys a, this isn't a some mad, but as I've gotten older, I've probably changed my opinion on it. I used to have a quote, uh, knocking someone out with a head kick is better than sex. You know, I love, there's nothing better. It's my favorite thing to do. That's my favorite coup to ground, to finish a fight and striking as a head. Yeah. The head kick. That's why I really push it with all my guys. It's weird too, when you connect to someone's had a lot of times you don't even feel it. It feels that it goes right through them.

Speaker 5:          01:33:35       Yeah. Especially the neck kick. I mean, that to me is my, my favorite technique. Air Coke's gotten a bonus with it and WC, Anthony's got a bonus WC knockout and UFC and when got it against a Jorge Santiago, um, yeah, it's, it's, you see Sir Little Sergio's hunting fork constantly. We like to kick that. It's this cool man. It's, it's yielding a special power that most people don't have. Dude. Like, Whoa, he's trending. Knock me out with a head kick. I love it. You know, it's an intimidation factor. It's like Peter Arts, he's same age as me. That's one bad motor scooter and he's still winging head kicks in his fights, man. Yeah, he's still at it, man. Hundred percent. Yeah. Peter is something else to me in his last fight. No, he said he was retiring. Yeah, he just fought in Dubai, so he said he was retiring and he just fought again. Anyway, man, that's just never going to retire. I love Peter. He sees a man like he, he, uh, he just exemplifies what's special about our sport. I mean, got like Rico Verhoeven grew up in wanting to be him and now here he is. And I mean, Peter's just, he's funny, joking, laughing and his, he been stopped something like 14 or 15 times. Yeah, I think so. I mean he's, how's that possible? But he's got over a hundred. Some fights. Is, is it possible

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       that you can kick code 14 times and you're still right? You're still out there and I hope he is. I don't know if he is. Yeah, he talked to him a little bit. What's it like? Oh, he's got a thick Dutch accent these days, so it's hard to tell if he slurring his words. That's a weird moment, isn't it? When you're talking to a fighter and you know for sure somethings going on that didn't used to be going on. You know, I've met a few kickboxers that or we'll punch drunk and I know boxers from back home. I mean one of my training partners, years ago, Chiro, Mcclellan almost died in a boxing match. That was one of your training partners. He's a mark. Yeah. Yeah. That was scary, man. That's scary. That scared a lot of good differences or phones. Sometimes boxing commentators and you guys, I feel we're empathetic.

Speaker 1:          01:35:47       You're empathetic to people's problems. I remember like doctor [inaudible] Pacheco was calling the fight. Like, I can't believe this guy is quitting. You could see like he was blinking. There's something seriously wrong. I, I, I'd never call fight again if I call the guy quitter and he slumped over in the corner and Freddie Pachecos yeah, he was old school. You know, a lot of those old school guys, they had that sort of an attitude about about, okay, yeah, go, go, go get punched yourself. You know what I mean? You've, you've gone in there getting punched. You gotten so made it wrestled. You'd know what it feels like. You know me too. And uh, now there's nothing worse than the guy who's never done it. Who's judging the guy who does it? I mean it is horrible and it's very unfortunate. It's unfortunate that a lot of those guys get into that position whether the reporters or what have you.

Speaker 1:          01:36:39       And they start talking shit about fighters after their performance, questioning their heart and courage and like, look, you can say that a guy didn't have a good performance. You can give an assessment of their performance. When you start making character assessments and character judgments, that site, you're stepping way out of line. Do you ever have bad days at work, Jamie? Sometimes you have bad day or off. Well guess what? Fighters fight two, three times of the year. Unfortunately their chance to have in bad days are higher than a guy who works, you know, many days a week. You know what I mean? It sucks. I mean, you just, I am not making excuses, but the Anthony Pettis that fought Guido was like the worst. Anthony Pettis, every was flat in the locker and he just wasn't feeling good and know what it was. The best thing for him losing is the best medicine. If you use it as a medicine to make you better, but people have bad days, man. It's just, it's life. I mean, it sucks when you have a big moment in your life and you just can't show up. But what Anthony has a piece of crap, a pussy, you know, look, you know, I mean I overrated. Yeah. You know that Duran, he's a wimp. No mohs. You know, like that fucked him up for a long time. Know that fucked up public perception of them. That fucked him up personally for a long time. Why

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       is it, it's okay. In our sport, we can tap, which is humane and smart and MMA. But if you know you're hurt like my flour but not in the Roberto Duran round. That was pretty shameful. Yeah. But the no mas fight me. He's like, that's it. I'm done. I'm done. He was fine and he wasn't even trying to fight. Yeah. It just, I mean he knew it was getting smashed though, but he wasn't getting smashed. Getting out box. My friend Nathan Corbett, it's great duties here at La. A training that black house that was he real, hey, so you're a busy man. So, um, I think he's going to start helping, uh, teach striking here in la. Dude. So if you're in the La area, look up my man Nathan corporate, Gray, Gray. But did you see him when he got smashed? He knew his ear was done.

Speaker 5:          01:38:40       I mean he didn't want to, you know, he took by tyrants bong and spawn, hit him with this left hook and or go Comstock. Yeah, hit him with this left Hook and blood started pouring out of it and he was just like touching his ears. Like this is over. I mean that's the thing. Do want guys to go out on their shield or they didn't want to be intelligent. I mean, um, that was intelligent. It's also a guy, Nathan Corbett has fought so many fucking times and you saw the replay when [inaudible] hit him. It was just a perfect left hook. His ear was fucked up, rattled. It starts pouring out of it when your ear jumps popped. But the fight is basically, that means you could do it, you know, all these guys I respect win, lose or draw. I mean that's the hardest thing about going to the UFC or I have personal relationships.

Speaker 5:          01:39:25       A lot of guys, there's not a lot of people, I mean in, in professional martial arts that are bad guys are just not like, I got like a high, you lost, you know, I just don't, you meet every guy and you see, you know, like that ABC wild world of sports, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat. It's just so you see that. It just, it's so hard to see the nicest guys get there. That's the weak side of what I do. You see? You know, cause that's what this is, you're fighting me to the crush, my dream to build yours. It's so like it's old school coliseum, you know. I mean, you know some crazy yeah. For guys to transition out of that to go to the next phase of their life. Man, I get fight offers all the time I missed.

Speaker 5:          01:40:10       Oh yeah, I love, I mean it was the last time you fight. What year was it? A 2007 I think. 2008 it says, what would you, where'd you fight in 2008? Uh, Canada. Yeah, I I love, uh, I love it. But you know, you gotta you gotta do the math is the fighting part of my past or my future. So no, what I do, I go a couple of weeks ago, anything was boxing in the gym I saw on Saturday. I'm like, oh screw it, I'll just spar three rounds with him. So that's, that's my thrill now I go on spar. We had a pretty good heated session, you know, it was fun. Not like we go hard cause I'm way bigger than him. But we work, we have a good time. He had fun. I had fun. But you know, it's a quick reminder like that, man. That's one little bad mother fucker.

Speaker 5:          01:40:51       I don't think I want to him or her again. And that was fun, but that was practice not, I'm going to go back to doing what I was doing. Actually. I do some Jujitsu tournaments when I can, you know, I want to, I won the Arnold and I won a, the grapplers quest. That was when I was a white belt. You got my blue belt. Now I'm just looking for a pocket of time. I can get serious. Cause I, you know, our Jujitsu team's grown tremendously under my friend and brother Dan have underway. Like we, we had two weeks ago we had 14 fights at Rufus Sport and MMA. 13 one nine of them were on the mat. Like that's not a Rufus sports dance. Right. I've been really pushing all my guys to be dangerous everywhere. We, a lot of my guys are going to Ibj JF tournaments, you know, big Nagios grapplers quest winning.

Speaker 5:          01:41:38       Like I'm really, if you choose to be an MMA fighter than really be an MMA fighter. Let me ask you this. So if you're training the Anthony Pettis world champion, say if you're training him for his title defense, uh, against Gilbert Melendez, which is going to be a great fight. I can't wait for that fight too. Amazing fighters. When you train him, would you schedule his entire training routine? Do you, do you set a schedule? Like in the morning, you're going to do this in the afternoon, you're going to do that. I want you to do five rounds on Tuesday and then another three rounds on Wednesdays. I'll give you his schedule. Um, we have a really good strength and conditioning team. The guy who the, who trains Jj watt from that. Can we bring that up? Jj Watt? Uh, do a box jump. Um, there's either box jump.

Speaker 5:          01:42:25       He's one of the best athletes in and it fell and it's not, he's from the Milwaukee or it's not by chance though. He's been at our strength and conditioning center, annex level, Brad Arnett, who used to be the head strength and conditioning coach at Arizona and Minnesota. Incredible. A lot of NFL or NBA guys watch this, does it do to our 90 pounds? 59 and a half inches. Yup. That is insane. That's who trains our boys at that facility. That guy does not know Jesus in the NFL as an insane vertical jump. Yup. And he, he's a big fan of the guys that he's out there all the time. He tripped plays for a who was at the Texas Titans. Um, but needless to say, what is the Texas tightens? The Texans are Texans six. And is that NFL? Houston? It's an NFL team. Yeah. But the soul out of the loop.

Speaker 5:          01:43:12       Yeah. I'm not a big team sport guy, so please excuse me. Um, yeah, the only so many guys in MMA at the same way, like once you get used to fighting everything else is like, yeah, I, Nah, it's not even that I don't have the time. I'm so busy watching my craft and then like, you know, like I dunno about you on Sunday. I don't want to watch a bunch of sweaty dudes who don't care about me. I'd rather hang out with a hot chick, which before we were married, it was my w you know, I'd just, I'd rather, uh, get a little r and r if you know what I'm saying. But what, get back to this Anthony Pettis. So also the schedule, the strength and conditioning is the big ruler of what we do. It's through, it's the recovery, the active warmup act of recovery.

Speaker 5:          01:44:00       But every Monday, Wednesday, Friday he goes there on Mondays at one 30, we have practice every day at one 30, he works a striking based MMA practice and then we have MMA sparring. Our hardest sparring is on a Monday. I believe we do that because it's their freshest. So the injuries aren't going to happen. I don't like to do smart. And at the end of the week, they're mentally, emotionally, physically drained. That's when injuries are going to happen. Does he do the sparring before, after the strength and conditioning program? After the strength and conditioning to that'd be counter intuitive. You'll probably be better off doing after. It's just the guys like doing it first thing in the morning. They get it out of the way. And, and the, the other thing I'll say about our smart, we've really backed off on the intensity. We have a lot of good technical guys were, I mean any, right now we're doing about three rounds, a little bit harder a week.

Speaker 5:          01:44:49       That's it. I'm really in everyone's wearing helmet, everyone's wearing high and gear, so no one's getting hurt because it's those wild scrambles in MMA. Were you getting weird positions, the wrestling and awkward positions where you getting hurt or collision? So, and then, um, after that practice he'll rest up and he'll come back and do a one on one pad sessions with me, uh, work in drilling and uh, you know, fight specific game plan. So he'll do on Monday, three times Tuesday, a little rest. He has the Tuesday, he rolls real hard on those days. It's Jujitsu practice. And then again at night he'll come back pad work, drilling a Wednesday is wrestling day with Max or Ben, ask him with the team and strength and conditioning in the morning at night again, pads, technique and you set the schedule for him? Um, somewhat with the whole team of everyone, you know, uh, our, our primary is in the evenings we do are are white work technique and a lot of drilling.

Speaker 5:          01:45:52       And so when he does his strength and conditioning program is it based on five round fights is based on, and the timing of the training we all meet as coaches and we put together what the intensity each week opt down if we're backing off tapering or if it's intense part of the camp. Oh, fascinating. Yeah, we really worked together like Anthony's taking all the coaches that he works with from our teams. So it's going to be great synergy for the girls who are on his team. And that's the part where it's really touchy to try to figure out how to peak and athlete. Correct. Yeah. I mean for folks who are not familiar with that kind of training, you really can't keep it up for very long. No, you do what you're doing during a six week camp. You can't, you could never do all year round.

Speaker 5:          01:46:39       Yeah, we've really cut back. We see my guys train all year round so they don't need to do 10 12 week campaign. 10 12 Lee camps are for slackers because they're trying to get in shape. And Anthony took the Henderson fight on a month's notice he had, he was at a going away party for Danny boy downs in my backyard. He had a Negro Modelo in one hand and a plate full of us take our chat on another hand and I said, Hey, um, Dana wants you to fight here in Milwaukee versus Henderson might want to put the beer down. He did. He was, he ran to his father's grave. He went for a crazy run. Boom. Started running. And you know, the point being, they're human beings, but if you're training all the time, it's a lot easier to take fights on short notice. Like a guy like Donald Cerrone, all the respect in the world.

Speaker 5:          01:47:26       He likes his Budweiser. What? But he's training constantly, you know what I mean? He's in, he's ready to fight. He just mentioned he wants to fight at one 70 of, if no one wants to buy them at 55 I love, I love his attitude. I didn't like him when he fight Anthony. But no, I re I, I liked Donald that, you know, you're my enemy when you're fighting us. But I, I liked Donald. He, I love what he is, what he represents. Like wow man, I love him. And he's a savage. When you say fighters, it's Serone. I, you know what I love about him too? When he's in his off time, he does crazy shit. He's fucking jumping with jet skis through there and done snowmobile jumps. You see that snowmobile shit. This dude was training for his last fight. Like what are you doing man? It's on your Sunday. You have fight training in the morning and you've, you've taken snowmobiles over the top of this hill.

Speaker 5:          01:48:19       No, I mean, I think you know some of the best, what makes these fighters specialists are great risk takers. You know, you gotta be, there's gotta be something special in you that doesn't tick like other people that makes you want to get into a ring and fight for amusement for people. I mean you for a bunch of people that are going to go online and call you a loser. Yeah. But you know people, what I miss the most about the fights, it's not the Paparazzi. I love that moment. Especially if you're the main event, you go back to the locker room, there's no one freaking there. Like people thought like when all the people back to and walk in, they're so supportive and we have this big circle of people help out sex. It wasn't when they Anthony one, well we had a press conference.

Speaker 5:          01:49:10       Everyone's long gone after the press conference. So did the ring girls hang out with, you know, what's their champagne in the locker room? No, it was me, Anthony, and I forgot who else walked out of there with our crap in the arena was close enough. We could walk to the hotel. It was pretty lonely but not lonely in a bad way. You know, it's our own little La Cosa Nostra this thing of ours. I like it. It being in a small circle and we what? We share the people who know what I'm talking about. It's like that's what I miss that moment yourself when you've accomplished it, not the after five

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       party. Not everyone. That's cool. I appreciate that support. But I like the quiet moment after like all that work, hard work, dedication, the blood, sweat and tears and you soak it in. Um, that's what I miss more than anything. I am no one know what I miss. I miss the most is I love it. That feeling when you get hands taped, it's like in gladiator when he grabs the sand. Dude, you're getting a hand safe. There's no turning back. You're, you're fighting. You know, it's like, it's the best feeling in the world, man. I'm a gold this though. It seems to me like you want to fight again. Always ready. It's a drug man. How old are you now? I'm 44 do you stop and think like, look, if I really want to fight again, I kind of do it now. But you see guy like Bernard Hopkins give you a little hope, always 49 years old.

Speaker 4:          01:50:43       All the light heavyweight timing. To me it's like, it's all comes down to time and schedule. But that being said, I love my students so much of my fighters, no one happened. I'd start training and I'd stopped cause I don't want to jeopardize their success. You know, I miss it, you know? But you know, it's like, uh, you know, a cocaine addict, man, I'm missing, I'm going to say shit. You know? But you're still getting some, a big amount of satisfaction from training. Oh, you know, there's nothing better than helping other people fulfill their goals. Not even, I'm not even just talking the fights, but I come to the gym, I spar with all my students. We have a ball. I mean, I'm seeing people change their lives through martial arts. So that's what I, that's what I gotta do to keep my drug in check.

Speaker 4:          01:51:35       I got to spar a lot, train a lot, just to have fun. When I get hurt and can't train, that's when I like, or I just, or if it gets too, I'm too busy and I can't be on the mat actually doing it. That's when I get crazy thoughts. Like who I might need something to motivate myself like a fight, you know, I try to justify these stupid stories too in my brain. Why should do it? Do you ever justify like maybe I should fight MMA? It'll help. My MMA coach was supposed to fight in 2007, um, for the CFC FFC the, it was me. I was going to fight this dude Derek pains I kickboxer and then uh, Kimbo slice was fighting tank and then the winter is our two fights. We're going to fight each other. So yeah, I was training them and I was into it and yeah, I was digging it out and the thing fell apart like 10 days before, you know, Kimbo slice is apparently going to fight for Bellatore. Yeah, I heard that. Yeah. That leg kick him now. He's cool dude. I met him when he fired Michio and I mean when I trained Matt Mitrione, uh, for the five days good. I mean,

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       but no one, there are guys like him who can come into our industry. They fight and they, they, they have fans and I mean look good Brock Lesnar did for our industry, but well bitch, Yo man, that was a great performance by hand. That was like one of his best performances. Yeah. I mean I just think stylistically, I mean Matt, Matt told me this thing, he played in the NFL. He goes, I just wasn't athletic enough to make in the NFL. I'm like, Jesus h Christ. Then what are those guys? Cause this dude is our freak man. He's strong, fast, tenacious. I mean all the attributes that you want and a heavyweight ease is a big, strong dude. Yeah. What do you think is going on with him and MMA? Like what do you think about his, uh, his MMA future? I mean he's training down at black ceilings.

Speaker 5:          01:53:32       I think it's a good fit for him. Doesn't he have a fight coming up? I think I forgot. It's just so hard to keep up with everyone. But he is, I think that's a good camp. They got the right size guys. Cause I mean I can't help man. I don't have any big guys. I was like, man, he's cool. He's, and some people they saw the show, they don't understand that guy's awesome. And at head games credible, he knows how to get in people's with people. Yeah. I mean I think that that uh, that verbal a Jiu Jitsu judo and Jedi mind tricks, it's so important. Yeah. It is right that that is an extra added element to psychological warfare and fuck with a guy and get inside his head before a fight. Right. Well, um, I'm the youngest of, for the longest time I was being youngest brother and my family before I had my younger brothers.

Speaker 5:          01:54:16       My Dad has five brothers. His two youngest brothers are almost the same age as my two older brothers. So basically I got tormented growing up. So the only way I could mess with people for a while was verbally and I had to learn how to mass with them fall break. You know, just, just, uh, you know, and then I started, I didn't do it at first and fighting. That's how I got a little older then. I, you know, started using little Jedi mind tricks. It's amazing how many good fighters come from a background where their brothers picked him up and made, it. Makes you kind of look at John Jones, two big giant super athlete brothers. Here's, here's, here's our cool story. My really good friend from Greek community in Milwaukee played for the eagles for many years. He started, he opened up the strength and conditioning place.

Speaker 5:          01:55:04       My boys train it. He, he's the agent for Jon Jones brothers and the NFL. Wow. Huge, huge MMA fan too. He was the, he played for the eagles for many years and Rosebowl cabin in Wisconsin. Yeah. Those guys are huge. They make John Look like he's like just a little wimp. John is a freak. Oh No. It really isn't the nicest compliment I've gotten from someone at UFC 100 towns that he learned how to strike from my DVDs from the old school. I like Johnny, you know, uh, we have a great relationship. He's a cool dude. He really is a freak man. I mean, you want to talk about a guy that's learned quickly and has his own way of doing things and the best at utilizing reach. Not a second guy

Speaker 1:          01:55:43       I've ever seen fight that knows how to keep a guy in his range better than John. I liked DC a lot. I think DC could give him some troubles, but the thing is, John still is so good at what he does and that reach plays such a factor. Huge factor. Yeah. I mean John's going to get better too. Yeah. That's the thing. He's going to, if you fight him six months from now, he's going to be a better fighter. You fight him a year from now, he's going to be even better and DC is going to go to surgery in July. He's getting his knee redone, his ACL is fucked and apparently it's got some other damage going on in there, so he's going to get crazy. These wrestlers, how they can continue to train what their knee like. Knock on wood, I've never had any knee injuries.

Speaker 1:          01:56:19       I don't know what it's all about. Like, well Chris Weidman, before he got his knees fixed, he got meniscus scoped on both of his knees. He had terrible knees. They said that he couldn't even get as heel to touch his ass. Just crazy. He's fighting for the world title and he, you know, he doesn't have full use of his legs, but he's still, he has enough that he can force himself into positions where it doesn't matter. It's just incredible. All right, let's talk striking who, let's, I want to pick your brain. Who's the greatest kick boxer of all time in your opinion? Ramon Decker deck or a rob came in. Those are, those are the two guys that I look up to other than the ties. This, there's some great ties. Yeah. I mean, there's so many great tie fighters. For me, I love decker style, but for me, rob, I mean rob, rob is a big influence in everything I did.

Speaker 1:          01:57:06       I, I went, the reason why I went to my first gym in Thailand. So you're talking, cause rob went there like I saw rob, there's a great fight. He beats her Nesto who's, Oh yeah, with low kicks and a Hook Kale. But I mean Ernesto, super athletic, but rob systematically broke them down and I, and I really enjoy fighters who know how to systematically break someone down. Um, greatest boxer of all time. I would say, you know, classically people say Sugar Ray Robinson and a, I think sugar ray Robinson is probably one of the all, I look at it as terms of errors. Okay. Cause I don't think anybody ever, if you look at their entire career, yeah. You know, you could say, well this guy was better that guy, but what ad is best? Julio, Cesar Chavez was one of the most impressive of all time. He had this unrelenting marauding style where he, he never threw everything in every punch like Mike Tyson style, but he just wore you away.

Speaker 1:          01:58:05       He would just come at you. And Andy was in a strong era of fighters. Yeah, very strong. I'm like, look at his fight against Meldrick Taylor systematically broke his body down, broke his and change Meldrick. Meldrick was never the same. You know, that fight broke him. If you've seen the legendary nights about that on HBO, it's very sad. I think Roy Jones Jr and its prime was one of the greatest of all time. There was a window where Roy Jones Jr was untouchable. The only fighter ever to have gone a single round without a single punch scored on him. The Vinny Pazienza fight, it's only fighting copy box history. They go, one guy landed, you know, x amount of punches and the other guy landed zero. That's madness in a professional boxing match. Roy Jones, when he was at his best, was a fucking freaked, wasn't technically sound, you know, relied on his reflexes but knew his body and knew his skills, you could say wasn't technically sound, but nobody was hitting him and told Tarver knocked him out.

Speaker 1:          01:59:02       No one was hitting him. He was fun to watch. You know the Rooster Punch you through. You know where I think he fucked up. Where I think he fucked up is, I think when he went up to heavyweight, he went all the way up to heavyweight. He got real big and then he went back down to light heavyweight. It messed his body up. You can fuck to his body up. He looked like shit when he, his body physically looked like shit. And I think also hormonally he looked like shit because let's be honest about how he got up to heavyweight. He didn't get up to heavyweight taking fucking friends stone's chewables. Right. He had some help. And when you're in your thirties especially, you know, your body doesn't bounce back very quick from steroids. You see someone pulled on over 20 pounds of muscle quickly.

Speaker 1:          01:59:42       It's just can't be done unfortunately. Yeah. Pull up. Um, Roy Jones Jr versus John Ruiz. You could see how good he was that he was a fucking former form middleweight in the Olympics. Fought one the super middleweight championship, won the light heavyweight championship, went up to fucking heavyweight outbox they shit out of John Ruiz who was a former heavyweight champion, you know from your area, right? Is he quiet man from Boston? Who is he? Is he with Petronellis or, I don't think he was. John Ruiz was with somebody else. Right. But look at this. This is Roy. I mean he was thick as shit. That's way thicker than you ever saw him at a light heavyweight. But he was only about 200 pounds. You know, even even then, like even as a heavyweight, it was all about speed and movement, but he was so good and so hard to hit, you know, Jones Jr when he was at his prime man, you know, it was a big over achiever and I use this style to teach people well as a Oscar de la Hoya, before he switched with Floyd senior, his nineties fights.

Speaker 1:          02:00:42       He was an incredible over achiever, a big fucking Roy Jones is in this fight that he had never been that muscular before. And then he went from that to the Tarver fight and he just looked terrible and car Tarver knocked him out. And then after that, Glenn Johnson knocked him out. And that was even scarier because he went out from a punch. It didn't even look like that big of a punch, but was out completely out cold like next if to hang out with Roy last year at been aspirins, last bellatore fight. He was there. And, uh, Albuquerque, cool dude, great guy. Great Guy. I got a chance to meet him in Vegas recently. It's a picture with him. I was so excited that I was with Evander Holyfield and uh, if there's, uh, Croatia, he's school. I mean, uh, my brother used to box at crunk and I got to meet Tommy Hearns. Nice. I, you know, I've, I've, uh, met a lot of cool old school box and guys, that's, I mean there's this something we grew up

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       on that sport. You can't, you don't discard it and you don't think about Roy Jones. Man is that he never had his Joe Frazier, he never had his Tommy Hearns. He never had like Tommy Hearns had Leonard Leonard. Do you know, they, they had each other, they had that rivalry. Roy Jones was just so above everybody. He had nothing until Tarver knocked him out. There was really no rivalry. Yeah, you're right about that. Hey, here's a, you just made me think of something. You know Tommy Hearns verse Leonard the first fight, if that's in the modern era. Oh yeah. Hurting this one. Cause it was a 15 rounder. That's right. If it would have been a 12 rounder, he would have won that fight. That's right. You know the 15 rounders stopped after boom, boom. Manzini knocked out duck. Who Cam right is. That's when they stopped. I think they'll, yeah. Duck cook him.

Speaker 5:          02:02:23       Dot 15 rounds. It's insane. Long fucking 12 rounds. We used to do kickboxing rules, 12 times two stupidest thing ever. Getting off the stool 11 times. No, let's do one round. I don't want to, I don't want to sit down now. Modern kickboxing. The the championship fights are only three rounds or five rounds. Five rounds. Yeah. Yeah. I'd like to see boxing. Shrink it down. What'd you really enforce? The action. I think that's why MMA and kickboxing or growing. What would you think boxing should be? Eight eight rounds. Really? Yeah. I mean, think about our culture. You want to know what Joe Rogan is doing? You can click on Twitter, Facebook, everything you want to order some cool stuff from Joe Rogan's shopping cart. You can click now. You want to go onto the Duke group, his striking university. You can click now, get whatever you want.

Speaker 5:          02:03:13       But that's our culture. We're fast food. You know, sometimes a boxing fight, it's like jazz. You got to wait for the jam to pick up. We're so fast food, everything. That's what, why I love MMA and kickboxing. The actions like now and then, oh that fights over and knock out. Cool. Let's bring another fight. Like a fight like the my Donna Mayweather fight where my Donna, that comes on strong in the beginning, but Floyd levels amount and starts to pick up the pace and the fifth and six rounds and starts to write down the stretch. For the guys who are making a lot of money, the 12 renders her great. The guys who find on ESPN Friday night fights for 10 and 12 they're making 10 grand, right? And then they're so busted up, they can't fight as much as kickboxers and MMA fighters. How did it make a living?

Speaker 5:          02:03:57       How do they survive? I mean that's the tough thing about boxing those long. I'd like to see, you know, and I've never understood why they go even rounds because you got a better chance for a drug that is true, right? Yeah. Go nine rounds. Yeah. We'd have a better chance for a victory. Yeah. I mean, or 11 rounds. Yeah. Something. I mean, you know, it's uh, just one of those things. I mean, I, I do like the title fights, but I just think for the guys brains, everything. Like how about two 10 minute rounds. Oh Wow. That would be interesting. Could you do that with boxing? I would think that with boxing you'd actually be easier to fight a 10 minute around that it would to be to MMA. Like those pride guys fought those 10 minute rounds. I had ends in any

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       way here last week. Oh yeah. Fucking awesome. So cool. Talking to him. But you know, that 10 round Mr younger more. Yeah. That first 10 minute round man was brutal. You'd get into a crazy exchange gassed out. You look up at the clock, eight minutes to go, what, eight minutes to go. Yeah. I mean, and they were real made into standups too. They're just really like yellow card if you're a passive. But I, yeah, I fell in love with him and May 1st with pride. So I, I love pride. I use, you know, I was the one guy, all the pride factor is going to come over the wall. They were, I thought pride was fun to watch, but from a tactical standpoint, I would watch the way they would fight. I would say, well some guys are going to give people some problems like Ninja and Shogun and all these guys were going to give people some problems.

Speaker 1:          02:05:29       But I would look at the like elite of the elite guys and it's like, hmm, I wasn't like George Saint Pierre or someone like that. You know, someone in the higher weight divisions. Well, I mean we saw it. Forrest Griffin. Yeah, whipped show Shogun shogun had some serious injuries. Man Shogun for a while had some serious knee problems, couldn't train hard. And that's been the knock on Shogun is the, that he doesn't really enjoy, like completely dedicated himself to training and being, you know, an animal in the gym constantly. And if you're not that guy, you're never going to be able to compete with those world class fighters. You're not going to beat John Jones if you don't like training. You know, it's crazy. Nikki holds can, can take this fight. But if you follow his Twitter feed and everything, like this dude is, he hadn't gotten a car accident when uh, rape before the last Denver.

Speaker 1:          02:06:16       That's why I didn't fight for the title. They are broadening car patching, but like, but he's been training but he's still didn't think he was ready for this fight. Like he's uh, the kid trains all year round. I mean, and that's the different like Mayweather, the reason why Mayweather, who is who he is. I mean he likes to train, you know, and guys, if you don't like your craft then don't do it. Yeah. There's a lot of people that just do not like it anymore. I mean, you know, I talked to Mike Dolce who, you know, he was working with rampage for one time and it would just say the guy just, he didn't want to train. It would find candy wrappers like tucked underneath his mattress. He had hide candy in his bed and he just didn't want to train and it's like so hard when you've got a guy who's so talented, so good but just didn't want to do it so hard to dry and then you've got other guys who, you know they're supposed to be there at five 50 they're there at five 30 they're stretching out there, they're skipping rope before the gym opens and Pedis is La is the Lowe's on fight and the Serone fight was back in the gym Monday training Sergio Monday cause they know what they get so inspired.

Speaker 1:          02:07:24       Amen. Then polling checks for mind. That's what I love about the UFC man. It's like, oh okay. I mean I was just counting up bonus checks from some of the guys. I think Alan Belcher's dump 300,000 just in bonuses

Speaker 5:          02:07:37       from the UFC. I mean I love that. I I I'd like to see glory maybe do that. I think that would make the fights even crazier like knockout of the night, move in the night and fight of the night. Now, what is it like being on spike? Oh, enjoying that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's great. I mean, uh, the art productions pretty cool. It's fun. I mean, I definitely had to get better when I was the third guy at k one it was so different. I actually went to broadcast school with Bruce back in New York, the original UFC. Yeah. He really gave me some good pointers when I worked with him. He's awesome. He helped me so much. Um, it's all about your notes and preparing and you know, because I'm not a class, you know, so much easier for you. You're, you're an actor. You're a comedian.

Speaker 5:          02:08:26       I, I can talk right here. I'm getting a booth. But those live opens, those are tough. And you know those, that's the toughest part for me. The live opens, but we're getting better. That's the easiest part for me is the live that too, man. That, that is the easiest part of my day. You know, we don't even rehearse it. Yeah. Goldie doesn't even, they don't even tell me what they're going to ask me. I think you guys have a really tight production and we're getting there. Um, you know, we're going to get some more shows under about yeah, it's, that's what it is. Shows under your belt. I'm having fun though. It actually, the other thing that's really helping me is my, my online striking university. I teach so much on there and I'm filming and I'm getting a camera since back cause a that, that's really helped me.

Speaker 5:          02:09:06       I'm having a lot of fun with that. I'm reaching people all over the world. Kind of like what Eddie Bravo was doing. I got this a technique technique, a training site. Now we have a affiliation too. So if you want to affiliate with roof for sport, kickboxing and a lot of cool benefits, people can come train with me as much as they want and it's having fun. You know, it's a check me out@dukeroufus.com it's, I'm having so much fun doing it because I have, uh, I, I even respond in my forum Q and a put up cool videos. I, I'm a teacher at heart, so I love interacting. I have a student now who's in from Ireland. I've just had some coming from tech. Like you were saying something really cool about your university, your online university debt. When you sign up for it, you get a free week at your gym.

Speaker 5:          02:09:48       So I decide to travel down to Mecca. Yeah. Wait a Milwaukee they could train with you for oh yeah. I mean I love it cause I mean you never know who is training. There's different guys visiting me and you just don't get my kickbox and you get, I like it, dude. It's a buffet. You want to train wrestling with aspirin, you want to train Jujitsu and your boundary. You want to train with the MMA team. Um, you know, hey, there's Anthony Pettis. He uses playing around boxing with a few guys have visited. Like they taped it and everything and that was cool. I mean, like I said, I always say I have a great group of guys at, at, at, at our team. I actually designed roof sport to be like a camp in Thailand. When I went to the timeline, all the kids were so cool. The Thai kids, they all help me. Especially if I worked hard and had a good attitude. They all took me under their wing and, and that's

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       what I try and teach my guys. You know, they're just very welcoming. It's really good for my, my, my students because they get new looks and new people to train with and it's just a fun time.

Speaker 3:          02:10:44       That's awesome man. And your university is a great resource for someone who maybe doesn't have a Duke Roufus in their city cause it's hard to find a really good high level kickboxing camp. It's really hard. You know, if you, you, if you're stuck in a town that doesn't have a good martial arts school, you can learn like really high level instruction online. Apply those techniques, videotape yourself, analyze it, compare yourself, helps a lot.

Speaker 4:          02:11:09       Yeah, I mean I, to me, I'm still a video junkie. I mean Joe, Joe actually gave me some pointers today, some new techniques. We, we, we, we, we got into, we got into the think tank today and you know, and that I'm always looking for, it's a game of just milliseconds in milliliters, eh, or millimeters. It's that little thing that will make the biggest thing happened. People don't realize that, you know, it's Anthony Pettis, a showtime kick. No, it was four and a half rounds of a great game plan. He did executed doing great basics that led to a special moment in his life. If he can do foot work, do the proper punching, kicking, defend, take downs, defense submissions we would ever got there. Yes. People look at the outcome. They don't look at the journey. You know what I mean? You've got a w w we were joking, Joe was doing a bad ass kick, his favorite and he has a good quick side kick.

Speaker 4:          02:12:07       And I said, Joe, you'd got the 10,000 rule down. They'd take see you 10,000 hours to be an expert at something. And people don't realize that they want it. You know, we have this culture. Yeah, I do teach a lot of wild techniques, but they work for the people who, you know, it's like I want to do a flying arm bar in Jujitsu. Well, you can't do an arm bar. You can't move your hips, you can't shrimp, you have no idea of position. So why are you gonna do a flying arm bar? You know, you to build up. Yeah, definitely. And just like everyone asked Ben when Ben asked her, I want to do the flying Granby roll. No, let's work on this boot verse. You know, it's, I culturally, we live in a ESPN sports center culture. You know what I mean? We don't see the whole game. We saw the dunk, we saw the home run, we saw the cool soccer shot. We didn't see the whole game of, you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          02:12:58       Yeah. Well it's also what you were talking about earlier about shrinking a boxing match down to eight rounds or you know, be the fact that you could download anything you want or order something on amazon.com with one click this, this, want it. Now thing that doesn't apply to MMA. MMA is a mountain that you have to build one grain of dirt at a time and it takes a long fucking time to become a martial arts master. To be able to kick like Anthony Pettis to be able to wrestle like bend askern, it takes thousands upon thousands of hours. And that's one of the things that we were showing today that we were working with like that. The reason why people don't know how to do it correctly is cause you don't, you don't see anybody doing it like that. So you see one person do it like that and you go, oh, that's possible.

Speaker 3:          02:13:39       And that's all it takes. You see one person that can bang, that throws that thing like a fucking lightning bolt and you go, oh, okay, everybody else is doing it different. But what you said about Anderson Silva, he kicks one dude in the face. There's fun kicks every fight. Yeah, it's crazy. What's, well Edson Barboza with that we'll kick of Terry. Adam. All of a sudden everyone wants to throw wheel kicks, you know, and then you see v toward do it to Luke Rockhold and a junior dos Santos do it to Mark Hunt to me. You start to see that everybody knows is this technique is really viable. And they start seeing it over and over and over again. It's a copycat sport and a lot of ways, I mean we all have healthy egos. We all want to outdo one another. We're all Alpha males there, you know, so the athletes themselves especially, they want to one up each other.

Speaker 3:          02:14:24       I mean, Jujitsu question, who can deal with Ron does armbar that's a very good question. We don't know because you know, you're seeing girls who have been able to defend it a couple of times like Misha Tate and the last fight defended it a couple times. I mean she did a really good job defending it until she finally got caught. Um, bill look at a mean. There's, I think Liz Carmouche show that there's some holes and Ron as game with that take down that she likes to do, cause she likes to grab the headlock and throw girls down to the ground and essentially giving up our bag. She gave up the hooks and then she got, you know, look with, she got away with it with Liz Carmouche who, I don't know what belt she is, but she can't close, does fucked her job. And Rhonda had to uh, actually like rely on her neck to try to release the hook.

Speaker 3:          02:15:15       She had to let go and just to not defend for a second and then got out of it. Luckily. But she was tweaked. I mean she couldn't chew food right. For like a week after that. If that happened. And let's say it's some real high level world champion, Brazilian Jujitsu, black belt, what would happen then? I mean that's going to be really interesting. But then again, the Ronda Rousey, the fought Liz Carmouche and Ronda Rousey that you're going to get today. You getting a way better, Rhonda, you're getting, uh, Rhonda. That's way better in the clinch at delivering shots. Like Sara McMahon knocked her out with that fucking liver body. Then the new deliver, she's just getting better. She's not stopping. She's going to continue and she's getting more comfortable. She's getting more relaxed with fighting. She's getting more relaxed. The fact that she's the UFC champion, so it's going to be really hard for someone to deal with that.

Speaker 3:          02:16:03       Yeah, it works. Davis has got a tough task, but she's tough. She's very tough. But I mean, uh, that's that one signature move. It's crazy. It's only been a few guys that have like a one signature move. They continued to pull off over and over again. Paul Sas comes to mind. Submitted more guys by triangle than anybody I could think of. He's a, he's got a lot of wins by triangle. His triangle is fucking wicked. If you get on the, he just it down. It's just going it down. Alright. Greatest Jujitsu fighter. Just Jujitsu. Not MMA greatest. The most impressive I've ever seen is Marcella Garcia. Yeah, most impressive. I got to see him alive in 2003 in Sao Paulo when he emerged onto the scene when he fought Shaolin. Yeah. Yeah. And he hit Shaolin with an arm drag and he took his back and Shaolin rolled and he kept rolling with them. They roll. Roll, roll roll until the time is done. Rolling. Charlene was asleep. Wow. I mean it was just wicked, wicked speed. And his squeeze and his technique, he was, he's the most impressive I've ever seen in real life. But I've seen him lose in real life to shock array. Tapped him. I saw shocker. Right? Shocker. Ray was very clever. He pulled guard and and got them into Kamora. Just fucking snapped his arm back and it Komora like on right away. All high level dudes. Yes. MMA grappling.

Speaker 3:          02:17:24       Well, grappling. Grappling. Okay. This grappling and then there's submissions. Okay. Submissions. I've seen some pretty impressive MMA submission performances. Damien Maia, when he submitted Rick story, I mean that is pretty God damn wicked. My is one of the best. But like wrestling or a jock or raise a beast for sure. You know, he's one of the best, but fucking Ben [inaudible] of the best grapplers as far as a guy who could take a guy that's a really tough, like really dangerous, big lightweight, really strong or welterweight rather big strong guy and just toss them around. Ragdoll I'm taking them down at will guy can't defend against it. Aspirin is impressive as fucking shit when it comes to that man. Really impressive. One of the reasons why me as a fan of just the martial arts period, I'm a fan of, I want, I think that one of the things that martial arts represents, what mixed martial arts represents is potential scenarios and how do you overcome potential scenarios if everybody agreed, okay, let's no more take downs from now on.

Speaker 3:          02:18:27       No more take downs though. An MMA would just become kickboxing and there's fights where that happens. There are fights where that happens, but they're true. Stick of standing Wang is, as Bj would say, Wayne take 'em down. Like I can't stand watching guys. Not that they suck. Good striking like, dude, you're really good at wrestling. Like a bunch of it must that suck for Andy Wang. Wang Bro. Cause it's about based on his high level presented Jujitsu black belt decided to stand with people. But he's like, what the fuck is he doing? Well, here's a fact back then.

Speaker 4:          02:19:02       I tell people constantly and I, I um, I don't think I'm going to get good enough to submit guys like you, Mark Jujitsu borough, Daniel Voll underway. I'm Anita, a cannon to take Minastrin down. Fact, fact is you can knock me out, Ben, conduct me out and Daniel could knock me out. Striking mathematically is a much more chaotic sport right? By Zig

Speaker 5:          02:19:28       when I should is ag. I get knocked out. There's no hate. Duke luckily tapped me with no, there's no walking, Jujitsu, maybe an MMA. If I hit you enough and you fall into leap, you can stay and get caught in an arm bar. But you know, it's not as easy as there was no walkie punches. But if I zig when I could have you go to sleep easy and striking. So if you're not, that's why I teach all my guys to make sure they get good at wrestling. Make sure they get good at Jujitsu because if you're struggling, say you break your hand. Wait a minute, I hurt my foot. Let's take this to the mat. Like an MMA striking. If it doesn't work can be your downfall really bad. And especially with hands. Hands are so easy to break. You hit someone on the forehead, your mind, and it's just so jacked from years and that's what just normal gloves, man.

Speaker 5:          02:20:17       My hand, it's just maimed. Yeah. You have like one shorter knuckle. It's smashed out of there. Whoa, that's crazy. Yeah, it's missing. That one's really overdeveloped. Am I? My hands are bad. It's been broken back there. There's a metatarsal there. Pop. Oh yeah. You get it fixed or to just, um, I've gotten a cast but it just, you know, the years of doing it, it just, does it hurt when you punch with it now? No. What? You catch somebody with that funky knuckle? This one or that one? This one. The first one. This. Yeah. But I have to, I have to put a bumper in there if I, if I'm going to fight again how bumper. Yeah. But a nice little gauze pad in there to make it even so, yeah, thanks to my main stitch, he showed me how to fix that. Well, you know, vittores broken his hand.

Speaker 5:          02:21:02       Something ridiculous like eight times. He said seven operations on his hands. Yeah. It's just the MMA gloves. You got to learn how to punch accordingly with an MMA glove. You can't swing. Remember when your, your AIA through down with, um, like Brown, both paws were smashed. Broke both his hands. Yeah. I mean, dude, early in the fight. Yeah. Man. Uriah, he's a really good friend of mine, man. That guy has an incredible heart. There's no quit in favor. Mental tough. Yeah. Like dude, I remember when he got carried out of the cage by Master Tong and, and uh, Fabio Prado after his leg with, although he lost the fight, but there was no way that guy was quitting. And that's why I respect a lot about your idea, you know? I mean, he's one of those great fighters who I not get the UFC title, but man, he's got heart and that, that just, he can't put a price on that.

Speaker 5:          02:21:53       Crazy. Would it be if Tj Dillashaw beats Borow again to rematch and then we see Uriah versus Tj. Wow. That's possible. Yeah. I mean that's the hard thing when you have a lot of fighters in the same weight and your gym. I mean everyone's the same squirrel going after the same nut, the ball and Kira Petchem we're sparring the week that he got the call for the fight, then they had to go fight each other. It was like that movie, uh, with um, with a woody Harrelson. And who's the spin? Antonio Banderas remember the boxing movie? They had the drive

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       to the fight together heavy. Are they both trained in Holland? What'd we say? Hey, you're on the same flight as me. That's happened to me where I've been on the same flight as a guy. Well, you know that you see with MMA guys being real friendly with each other before they fight in a way that you never really see with boxing. My why is that you think? You know, I think I noticed wrestlers will wrestle each other. Train, wrestle each other. Train. Same with Jujitsu. We're like in Thailand, everyone's respectful, but no one trains with each other in the hall when they're good sportsman, but no one trains with each other. Like, I don't know. I mean, but then again in like collegiate mean wrestling, like Minnesota and Iowa are bitter rivals. They never, you know, I would just, I was their own little world.

Speaker 1:          02:23:13       They don't do anything with anyone. They're just like feral cats. They don't mess with anything. Also in another place, like we were talking about Boston, about Boston, the women aren't the best look and it's cold as shit. Everybody's anger. Nobody wants a fight. That's nothing compared to Iowa. You know, people would, I would, would vacation in Boston and change and go, this place is amazing. Everyone's hot. Look at all the teeth payback. It hit you. I hope you're listening. Just the fact, I'm sorry, but the plus side is I would create some of the toughest motherfuckers ever. I mean, not just a military camp and one of the legendary camps of MMA, but I mean, how many top end they grow. Giant fucking deer down there. Holy Shit. Some of the biggest deer you ever seen your life. I got to give a quick thinks. Um, Pat Miletich, she's been a big part of my development in MMA.

Speaker 1:          02:24:04       He really took me under his wing are come down. We used to bring a lot of our guys to cross train together. Um, Pat's a dear friend of mine and I love the way he calls fights. Yes, I do too. He's like you and I, he, he's telling all those little extra details that people want. It's a punch. A kick. No, the what? The, when the where, the why, the how and no nonsense too. I liked his no nonsense approach to commentary. He'll tell you when a guy's in trouble. Like he's in trouble. He's losing this guy. This guy's got to get busy. He's got to go do something. He doesn't take a safe path. He doesn't, you know, he doesn't sit on the sidelines and just sort of call the action. He'll tell you what a guy has to do with this. Guys got to get busy.

Speaker 1:          02:24:43       He's got to do this. If he doesn't do this, you're gonna lose this fight. Now pad actually was one of the first innovators of true MMA, mixed martial arts. Wrestling, striking. It's good at grappling was a bad mother fucker. Dude was a bad motherfucker, dude. I took no, no. What I did when I wanted to find out what Anthony Pettis was made of, I took Cayman Sergio down to probably circa oh seven are probably oh seven oh eight oh seven. So I took him down there and pat random through the, he sparked with both surgeon and you know, Oh yeah, no, you know, you know, it was cool. Is

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       I, that was before I built my camp. That was the testing ground. You got to go, uh, that practice room. Oh my God. But the practice room, the way they did it back then as opposed to weigh and intelligent camp, they didn't know any better. They were, they were. Yeah, they were. And they were the innovators of the MMA camp. They were the original, you know what they call themselves? The Black Legion. Yeah. It was based on the Croatian Black Legion. Nah, man. I mean, I've seen guys get knocked out. They drag him off the man. Hey Pat, what's going on today? Has a lot of guys are going, I've got to thin the herd. Duke. Yeah. Okay. You, I mean it's a, but I mean, I was there with, you know, there's Tim Silvia Rothwell says Malevich Rory, mark, um, uh, Jens, the dentist, Josh Neer, um, McGiver in just the list goes on of all the different killers on the mat.

Speaker 5:          02:26:23       And it was just fun. I mean, you know, they had this crazy dude, Ackerman, he was a former wrestler with his legs cut off and he had the craziest strength. I grappled them. He could do the weirdest submissions. He had like the shoulder of awkward stick is halfway egg into my hip and lock my shoulder. And it was like the most painful submission I've ever been in. Nicest guy. But he was, he, if his legs were not cut off, he'd be super tall. One of the best rappers I saw him actually, he did a submission tournament with red Shafer. He was getting put in a north south and he did it back to him from the bottom and choke them unconscious. He countered. Yeah. Whoa. Yeah. It was a really cool counter. How did he do it? Like I want way, uh, I'd have to pull the video up somewhere, but this guy just had crazy strength.

Speaker 5:          02:27:16       So the guy had north, south on them are nowhere. Yeah. And he had a counter to it is, it is crazy. I forgot what he caught him with, but he just, he, because of his unique strength and we'd be warming up and he'd run on is for cut off legs. Yeah. But just a great guy. Great incredible grap word. And he was a great wrestler too. And because his legs are cut off, he could fight it. A lighter weight class. Oh my God. So he had the army? Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Cool Times. And just, um, some of the old school guys that fought way back from the day, I forgot the guy's name, but he looked like Mr. Freeze. I've never been grabbed harder by one man. Just grins. Jeffrey's uh, what was his name? Uh, the guy from, I forgot one of the, he fought in the old school, UFC.

Speaker 5:          02:28:07       He's a cop and, and uh, I'm having a brain fart to look like a white bald guy. Pretty big. Not Monson. No, no, no. He only fought once or twice, but definitely, I mean, padded the history there. It was so cool. I mean, and then he'd have Brazilians visiting guys from all over the world, kind of what I'm doing now of it, you know, he had guys in what happened in military, says gym just doesn't exist anymore. It's there. I just think Pat's doing a lot of military teaching and uh, as well, he is doing his color commentary and access. He's really into his family, to his girls. He growing up, I mean, uh, and so he doesn't train fighters and he helps out a little bit. Yeah. I don't think it's something he wants to do full time. It's not for everybody. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          02:28:55       You gotta be, I mean, sometimes, you know, he got her a bit of a ride, that emotional wave, you know, I've had some times, you know, that negative influences and uh, your Jim and team where I'm almost ready to give it up. Negative influences. You mean like people in attitudes, but I gotta tell you I'm, I'm the happiest I've ever been coaching and teaching right now my whole life. Like there's gotta be some indication now you've got a world champion, not just a world champion. He hadn't belt or with aspirin, but now you've got the big, you know, the big one. I think that's cool, but I'm going to tell you, Joe, Nora, it's all about the people. You do it with, the peep the faces you're there with every day. You know? I mean, that's what it's all about for me. I would be doing this if I didn't have champions and didn't have famous UFC and guys on the high level.

Speaker 5:          02:29:46       But it's the feeling you, you know, the feeling you have when you walk into that place every day. The people that look back at you and that to me, I, I can only do things that make me happy. I unfortunately, I'm not the guy who shuts up and we'll do it just to do it right. Paycheck. It's not me. And so that's when I'm happiest. So that's why you're so good at it. Oh thank you. You're so good at it because you have so much passion for it because you throw yourself into it cause you commit to it 100% and because you're, you're so deeply engrossed in the world of MMA and kickboxing and you're just, you're so mean. You're, you're living in it all the time. If you didn't work for glory, you and I can have the same conversation. Definitely. For sure. I mean I can watch fights, talk fights, like people come into the gym visit and that like, holy crap.

Speaker 5:          02:30:34       It's like, what time I could keep going and going. And God, I, this is again, getting back to the team. I love the people. My guys are, they're not saints. Well trickles down. Yeah. I just saw today are you set a great example in that champion that train training your gym before and it's a very, very friendly environment. It's really cool. Hard worker. Thank you. Everybody's there to, to do their job. Everybody's here to work hard, but it's a very friendly, like very family environment. Cool. We tried to set up like the new place, especially at like a clubhouse. So if you're not training, you're hanging out. We got the flat screens. I mean, um, you know, everyone's going to watch the, uh, free fights it and the world series of fighting at the gym Saturday. Like I wanted to create a community like a real,

Speaker 4:          02:31:21       again, that's kind of how Tang on was all the guys lived at the gym and you know, fights around guys would watch one of the guys fight on TV. It's just in general. I mean, I think that's what martial arts is. The dojo is a extension of the community center. You know, for me, I really like reaching out because I have a lot of guys besides like, you know, the pedis. His Dad was shot or stabbed and killed. My, my Guy Mike Biggie Rhodes, who fights in UFC is fighting the New Zealand. Great Kid, moved from Iowa, actually his cousins, Mike Van Arsdale. And uh, he, uh, you know, he has a tough story growing up. His parents abandoned his grandmother, you know, raised him. He went, earned his degree in college once he graduated from college, moved up to Milwaukee when the RFA title and then he's now in the UFC.

Speaker 4:          02:32:05       Live in the dream. But what I love about him is he's so positive about the shit life he comes from. He doesn't complain. He's about the same with Anthony. He don't cry about what it was. It's, he's focused on what he wants to become and what he has because he's happy now because he's overcome. Yeah. And just, I mean, even my guy, Rick Glenn, his sisters dying of cancer and he had to cancel out of the fight earlier this year and he's struggling. He's going to win that belt Saturday and he's going to dedicate it to sister who's, you know, been in hospice struggling. And I, I, I love the character and the strength of the people I'm around. It's inspiring. It makes me want to do more. So when I say I want a flight that's selfish, those guys make me not want to fight and focus on them. Yeah. Cause man, they're just, I love people who dedicate to themselves. There's nothing worse than watching people waste their money.

Speaker 1:          02:33:02       Pancho. It's cause the spike game so hard, man. It's such a, it's such a grind. Everything in life. Yeah, you're right. You know, even you probably know Comedians, actors who just are self destruct. I medians especially. Yeah, it's the roller coaster, man. It's so hard to watch guys who have everything, but they just won't talk to be dedicated hard. That's why a gym like yours is so important to be around a bunch of other dedicated people. You inspire each other. I have a bunch of dedicated comedian friends and I call upon them all the time for inspiration. We inspire each other and being around guys that are constantly writing and pushing and going for it, it makes you want to do the same. The same thing with training when you're around guys that are training twice a day and training hard and they're really enthusiastic about it and pushing everybody and going for it. It brings that up in you. You want to do it yourself.

Speaker 4:          02:33:51       Yeah, I love it. Like I don't have to raise my voice too much anymore. I love that because they know I won't. I won't. I don't want to be a dick in the practice room. I want to be cool. I want to laugh if we're working hard, you know, my pound sign is having fun, getting it done. If we're doing work hard but have fun, you know, it's cool. I mean I got my other guy Dustin or t's fight, tough fight and Scoggin so some of the, you gave me some tips for the fight that thanks. You know, some techniques with science has a very interesting side to side stance and he's very good wrestler too, which is a real con weird combination with that. That karate background. Big Fan of that kid. No, no, I mean f flyweight division. I don't care what you fans are talking about.

Speaker 4:          02:34:30       That is a sick stack division. Wild, wild, wild division. You know, how will you, I'm enjoying transitioning into commentary. Do, you're doing commentary now for glory, you know, and it's very nice to see high level kickboxing on spike and I commend them for putting it on. I was so happy when Gloria got onto, I was one of the first people tweeting about it. I've watched every event. I fucking love it. I'm a huge, huge fan. What does it like doing the, the commentary you enjoying that I'm, I'm the biggest fan myself. You know what I mean? I really am. That's what come, it comes across. I think. I love it. I mean even before, like I surprised myself that I became a world champion and kickboxing. Like, I just wanted to fight to validate my coaching and I just kept on winning fights. I'm like, Oh, I guess I'm all right at this.

Speaker 4:          02:35:16       But at the end of the day, I'm still the biggest fan. Like, I, you're going to have to kick me out of here today. I could just keep, you want to look at more fights. Like I can watch it until the cows come on with you, man. It's, it's, that's, you know, that's why I don't watch other sports because I think we're in the coolest sport. There's, you know what, the two oldest sports on the planet are wrestling, no fighting and runners. Oh, either run, not the beef food or running to get your food. Either fight not to be food or fight it. They're the two most primal things you can do. Especially fighting, I mean, that's what this, uh, kind of kind of a, it's a Cicero quote or my arm. The best protector of the sheep is the wolf. I believe that some people in there, wolves and some people are sheep.

Speaker 4:          02:36:05       You know, people love fighting there. The wolves, they're the protector. So, you know, and it's kind of like training days to it, talking about it takes a wolf to catch a wolf. But like fighting is dude, it's the most primal thing. I'm, I still miss that. That dude wants to kick my ass. I got to kick his ass. It's the most nerve wracking. It's like, uh, all right. So I was a little experimental when I was a child and teenager after I lost my sister, I saw about 25 or 26 grateful dead concerts. And I, I'll use this analogy, I'd say that I'm fighting your first fight if you'd never done it before. It's like taking acid. Either find yourself or lose yourself. I've seen people are the baddest ass person on the planet. They're the best fighter in the gym. And they go to the fight and they just melt like butter. They're just can't, you know, it's like they trip out, you know? And that's what I love about fighting. You got to take who you are and that and the the gym and you're a god in front of people.

Speaker 5:          02:37:15       And I'll do it in front of 20,000 people or in a local show, do it in front of 2100 people. It's still, I love that vortex, that rush of proving grounds. Yeah. Real, true. Proving ground. An exposure of truth like nothing else because that's what I think. It's like I've seen so many people lose themselves. Dude. All right. Bring up being dwarfed by the mall. Bring up this clip. This is when I knew Anthony Pettis was special. Um, Anthony, all right, I'll give you the fight. He, he gets his shoulder popped out and he gets up and knock the dude out with a head kick. Like, check this out. And this is when I knew like, and I have a lot of kids like this who just have that thing. Um, Anthony Pettis verse.

Speaker 6:          02:38:04       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:38:06       Dead Air. Mike Lamb, brick, l a m B, r, e, c, h. T and this you'll see raw. But you want to talk about how you find yourself and lose yourself in life. This is one of those moments like, and uh, you know that, that's why I love that. You know, whether it's, you go do it. I do Jujitsu tournament wrestling match, whatever man. Like getting in a Mano a Mano situation is until you've done one on one sports, you just don't know what I'm talking about. Here it is. So how did he get his shoulder? Fuck. They'll see it here in a second. He's teeing off on it. Yeah. That's old Anthony. That's that, that, that's hood red ant just come out the bell rings and that don't look like new Anthony, right? Yeah. He's throwing a wild share right there. All came down. Yeah. Fuck the shoulder up. Yeah. So now how bad was the shoulder? Fucked up. Wait till he stands up. You're going to see something just crazy. And uh, you know, just what I do is I always judge people on their potential, not a each performance. And like when I saw this, I knew that this kid had super potential like hearing hip escape. Yup. Marking fines away.

Speaker 5:          02:39:30       See it dangling. Oh yeah. It's fucked up. So watch this. This is why this kid special. All right moves. Wow. Oh, switch off the front leg too, right? Yep. So that's why when you find yourself with a fucked up shoulder, yeah. Didn't have out, didn't think about quitting and show that again. Jamie, Jesus Christ. You know what I mean? Wow. Everyone thinks he's just this flashy kid and deep shin. That's, yeah, that's perfect. It's, that's beautiful. Then you're going to be, you can't celebrate his shoulders so bad. Now what happened to his shoulder? What did he want him doing? It popped

Speaker 4:          02:40:13       it out. That's why I hesitated. He never gets injured in training. It's in fights, man. Wow. You know, and that shoulder was hurting him for awhile and he had to go through it and he got it fixed and here he is, you know? Wow. Yeah, just crazy. I mean like you just got that, that thing that, that's what competing in the ring, the octagon like, you know, it's just, I love that. That's what I missed. That we got to, you know your mind. Like when I'm in the locker room, I don't care how bad ass your, your mind's fucking with you. It's like you're on a trip. You don't feel so good today. You don't want to fight. They got to be like, fuck you, he, come on, let's go. You know, like everyone has doubts in your mind. That's the key. You got to keep all those voices out of your head.

Speaker 4:          02:41:03       Like Ah, you know, it looks kind of Arosha is, you know, seriously man, you're tripping out back there and then you know, it's like you find it, you get your hands taped and you figure it out. But you know, it's such a head trip. There's a Mike Tyson used to talk about that. There's a cool speech he has where he's like, if I met before in the locker room, I'm getting my gloved up, I'm pounding the leather and, and I'm scared. He's been training for me and I go up there. But then I walked to the ring, I feel like a God. And then when I walked to the ring, I look at them and I don't take an, I look for a Ci, a chink in his armor. You know, it's just, I love that intense moment. I know

Speaker 3:          02:41:43       when you see it anymore. That's one of the reasons why fines are so intense when you're watching them. On television. When you see Chris Weidman stepping there against Anderson Silva and two weeks, or excuse me, against Leo Machida in two weeks and you see those guys opposite each other on the other side of the octagon. You know those are the two best 185 pounders in the world and they're about to go and the referee, whoever it is, looks at him. Are you ready? And it looks at the other one. Are you ready? Like, Holy Shit. Here we go.

Speaker 4:          02:42:07       Well, I'll give you my perspective. Like I just get these dudes who are like, I could be the best fighter. I'm great at street fighting. So you're good at going, hey, I'm going to hit you by surprise. You want to know what takes to be a real gangster? I don't like you. I got to fight you. I'm fighting for the world title. Guess what? We got to go on press tours. So every time I see you, my adrenaline spikes, man. I hate fucking jober. What do I got to be here with them? All right, we've got another press conference. Oh Shit. We're in the same hotel room all week. I keep running into this asshole. So every time it's like, I got to think about this guy more than anything. Oh, we're at the way in the back and I get to stand next to him. Oh No, now we got to walk out. Now we've got to stare each other down. Oh Shit. And this is all you think about. Then you walk out, you walk out first. Now you got to hear his song you're in, you're in the ring waiting for him, and then you know how many times I'm the high level you confront with each other as I love about little shows. You see the dude at the Wayne and then you show up and kick his ass. There's nothing but on the big man. Then

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       you're constantly forced to be with that dude. And that's something that folks don't take into account when they think about a fight, a championship fight, the amount of press these guys do and the amount of interviews they have to do the same question that you have to answer over and over and over again. Morning radio shows, interviews with the reporters. Had enough. Enough, enough, enough. It's an added element. Oh, stressful element. People who can handle the, the, the big, big light media. I mean that, that, that's, you know, that's a tough thing. Gory. I mean, here you're the fuck fucker Milkman, right? You know, but the restaurants small, the way we're, we're at, there's not a lot of stuff around there, so it's like, man, I used to hate it in k one we take the same bus to the fights. Wow. It, my, my first time I fought in Japan, they didn't have separate bathrooms.

Speaker 1:          02:43:57       My opponent was on the table next to me. That's how it is in Thailand at Lindt Bunny Stadium. Like, then you got to sit like in a chair waiting to go right next to the dude you're going to scrap with. It's just like the coliseum. Wow. Walk out with your opponent. It's a trip. You know what I mean? Like people don't understand the head trip about fighting again. That's why I say it's like taking some Hallucis, the gins, it's, he can trip out a little there. You know, it's very distorted. Very reality distorting. Yeah man. I've seen people crumble under those situations. Like I've seen the toughest, most athletic people who can handle the psychological side of it. And when a fighter loses that's when things get cause then you start to question everything. Your camp, you start questioning your conditioning program, you start questioning how you're set up and how you're setting your training up as far as how much emphasis is on this and how much is on that.

Speaker 1:          02:44:48       And maybe I need to do Jiu Jitsu coach or maybe my striking coach doesn't understand striking for MMA. Maybe I need to move to Albuquerque. Maybe I should live in Seattle with Matt Hume or go to Montreal. It for us a hobby. Yeah. I mean do you mind starts fucking with you? Yeah, I mean especially people if they've been an Alpha male successful their whole life. My biggest advantage, I've been an underdog my whole life so I'm really good at like I'm like Henry Hill, I know that once like he said and everyone's got to take a beat and once in a while. So I'm, I'm mentally strong. Cause I know like meetings. You know what it's like. Yeah. Whether it's verbal, abusive, you know, physical, the like people who've never had the struggle. Those are the people that drop off the worst. That's one of the reasons why those guys who have brothers are so fucking dangerous.

Speaker 1:          02:45:38       You who's had brothers? Jon Jones, because Chris Weidman was beat up by his brother his whole life and widens brother, put him in the hospital, dropped a metal plate on his head. Wow. Yeah. I mean there's a lot of shit with those guys. Matt Hughes, he had a fucking Twitter, just as bad ass as him. Another gorilla growing up, beating the fuck out of it. She decided not to fight so his brother could be championed. It's that crazy. I know. Or think about what his brother could have been. Yeah, it would probably cause his brother was good at it. Very, very successful. We fought once and he didn't eat. Yeah. I mean you fought another organizations too. I believe. I believe so. But other Marilla

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       huge. I mean, so again, that mental side of this sport that's, I know what I like to do. My new, I run my, um, my older fighters are kind of like navy seals and the base navy seals don't have to wear the uniforms. They don't have as much protocol. But my newer fighters I put in through my spartan training, I try and see what you're made of early on in your career. If you have any aspirations, if you can't get through the spartan stage, you're never going to get to the top level. You know what I mean? It's kind of what, what difference. I'm just, we're a little harder on them. And then my pro guys, the pro guys are made guys, man, they've been doing it, you know, that's the difference the way you talk to a high school football player as opposed to a NFL work.

Speaker 4:          02:46:58       You know what I mean? And I'm not, I don't do it to be mean. I want to see what you're made of man. Right. If you break down cause the coach gotten your ass or kind of a pussy, aren't you? You know? Sorry, I wanted to make you great. Yeah. Sorry. I want you to win, so I don't want you to get your face three arranged. Yeah. Dealing with adversity and have an all forms, verbal adversity and if you can calm yourself down during those horrible moments of Duke Roufus screaming at you. Yeah. I mean that's not always, but I mean, I just know my brothers did. My, my brother Noah, I'll describe my, my sister died when I was 15 and I, I found her dead. She died of sids. It was pretty tough. It's probably why I didn't have a kid for a long time, honestly.

Speaker 4:          02:47:38       That's told my wife and I, you know, later in life and it's is pretty traumatic for me. He used to say it's not feel sorry for Duke, it's just what I figured out and I feel better now about it, but I was 16 that I decided, hey, I've been doing martial arts my whole life, but I said, I want to be a fighter. My brother was older than me. He's 20 he's already world champ. And Rick was a killer. The scene at a godfather. I remember when Michael Goes, you know, I want to be in the family business and my brother's like Sania hothead, like the same. The same for you kid. Remember he goes, you're used to shooting them from far away. We kill him up close. And my brother was kind of like scoffed at me. Like, you want to be a fighter? So I had to go through the Rick roof, this indoctrination.

Speaker 4:          02:48:23       My brother man, he used to lay Beaton's hounding me like you wouldn't believe. Yeah, hit me with spin back wheel kicks back then. I mean, that kid was, you know, dude, my brother is amazing, especially in his game, PK style kickboxing. But I was like a rocky movie. I just kinda kept coming back every day. I just, I was so messed up, but I just wanted it so bad. But I'm not saying that bad. I'm glad my brother did that to me. He made me so hard. He made me Bain, man. You know, I was molded in the darkness as he said. You know, Remember Bane and the Batman movie, you, you guys nearly choose the darkness. No, I was

Speaker 5:          02:49:08       molded in and I had, I had to go to hell every day. I used to box in the inner city in Milwaukee, in the Martin Luther King Center. It was like they had seen at our member a true romance. Is it whiteboard date? No, I don't think so. You know, my nickname was snowflake. You know the only white guy in the room, you know, is, it's like years of oppression. Just, you know, but it's cool. I got my ghetto pass now I'm all like everyone knows back home that I can throw, you know. But that's what made me, you know, a lot of guys don't want to go through that. I'm so happy I had to do it that way because it made me so mentally tough that I have gotten my ass kicked and had the, that's a hardest thing in the world. Get the crap kicked out of you and then you have to go beat someone else.

Speaker 5:          02:49:55       You know it's dude. What's the worst humiliating thing you can do in life? Get your ass kicked in for our, gotten everybody, God and everybody. Yeah. Some guys, they have one loss, one big loss and they just never recovered. They never the same again. Toughest thing I had to do in my whole career. I fought 2001 they needed a quick replacement for um, k one at the Blasio. I took the flight like on three weeks notice I had another fight plan. I was just starting my major strength and conditioning for a flight. Seven weeks later, no, or like 45 days after that one. So the decent amount. So I've just, but hey man, it's k one if I, when I'm back in the super 16 to go to Tokyo. So I come out there, I threw down with Stefan, let go. Um, it was a great fight.

Speaker 5:          02:50:41       I think it's on youtube actually. We're, we're, we're going in. I felt so great. First round. I sit down on that stool, boom in a wall and then man, we're going at it. We're going to eight drops him once in the segment and then the second round I go to opera cut and I just reached too far. I see that fricking opera got common. It's like, it's, that's a worst thing that can happen in your life. See a counter. Oh fuck, I get it with it. Next thing you know, I'm looking up at the lights, but the thing is, I was suspended 45 days. I think it was fight in 46 days later. So I had to go fight. That one's on youtube to me, verse Pedro Fernandez. He lost by stoppage and then 46 days later he fought again. Yeah. It's against the guy who only his only, um, losses were to my brother and Marie Smith coming into that fight.

Speaker 5:          02:51:30       Wow. So when you do that, I, that was the toughest challenge in my career. Wow. How much time do you wait until you spar again? Uh, I waited a good amount. I really didn't spar it all a shadowbox pads, everything. Wow. Yeah. Just to give your brain a arrest. Yeah. That's so important. Yeah. There's so many guys get knocked down and training and then they go to the fight and then they can clip by one shot and there, but I know a couple of guys, I won't, I won't rat them out to the UFC that have gotten knocked out and training and still fight. And they told him, I'm like, man, you can't do that. So yeah, I mean, yeah, it was, that was the toughest of my career. It was

Speaker 4:          02:52:06       because not only that, but man, I just got knocked out f out like that takes a PCU away. Like you think you're some bad mofo, you know, like, Eh, I home rink, I had gotten stopped by someone since, uh, Mike Bernardo and 96, so I hadn't been stopped rock put on my ass by anyone since like that point. You know what I mean? So it's years, you know, it, you know, when you get dropped on your ass and it takes the, you know, it's like maverick and a in top gun. Can you get a bag? You know? But that was for me, the toughest fight of my career. I ended up winning. I stopped a guy in three rounds. But you know, that's the thing people don't realize. And Golf and tennis, Yay. Loss Bro. You know. Yeah. You lost a basketball game. When we lose, it's, it's catastrophic

Speaker 1:          02:52:59       guy loses in an MMA fight or a kickboxing fight or even a wrestling. It's like someone just stole who you are. Yeah, definitely part of your essence triangles. You and you're like, he just owned you,

Speaker 4:          02:53:13       Ben Henderson. You could see like not robbing it into Ben Cause I like Ben respect them a lot, you know. Um, he the great performance, by the way, Ben Curry, I told him personally at the time,

Speaker 1:          02:53:24       fight fight was fantastic. That's so good enough. Yeah. No Dude, he has the pedes factor. Anthony creates his own little Frankenstein. He's making this dude get better man. He was like, he's coming back, got damaged, stay down. Don't come back. I can't wait to see that rematch shut up. I know cause it's hard to be the guy three times. I always say that it was always hard to beat someone, you know, sooner or later. Like how mark has caught up to back. Yo,

Speaker 4:          02:53:54       you know it, you could see Ben just crushed. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:53:59       That's the artist thing. I respect them. And that's the hardest thing about the sport. You see your opponent. I'm glad. Yeah. It drives me nuts when guys don't tap in to get their arms snaps and then, you know, they're fucked. Well Jon Jones lost his title or could have lost his title to Vito Belfort, but he decided not to tab. Yeah. And when Vito was cranking on that arm and it was hyper extended, John made a decision, a decision, I'm going to let this song and get fucked up. And his arm was fucked up for a long time. That's why he coached on the ultimate fighter with jail because he really couldn't train her fight. So He's like, just coach. You know, what's the worst time, worst lock break you've seen? Is it Maghera or Tim Silvia? Yeah. That'll know. Gary is just as bad, if not worse. Maybe no. Garris worse. Cause it was no, Gary, I remember my boy Danny downs. I can't believe member when the Kimora he got put in. Yeah. That kid is so tough. Yeah. Amazing. Yeah. He's actually coaching in San Diego at a victory and remain, he writes for the UFC. Oh, beautiful. Yeah, he's got some funny stuff, man. He's cool. But that's one tough Irish kid. I just, yeah, I couldn't believe like he just, you know, again,

Speaker 5:          02:55:05       sometimes guys don't do as well as they'd like to do in the UFC, but I'll tell you one thing about that kid heart courage. He went out on a shield. You know, sometimes as an athlete you're the hammer or the nail. Your job is to entertain the fans. And the kid came out to fight every time. He was very fun to watch, very fun to watch as all your guys are you, you produce really exciting fighters or tried to, I mean, uh, something I learned years ago from growing up, my dad was a promoter. You know, you want to be a promoter's delight. You know, you want to be the guy that, hey, we got to get these guys on there. You know, it's fun. You know what I mean? To Sergio's credit, he tried to finish a fight. He was winning against Bruce Lee Roy and he dropped first submission, made a tactical area wanting to finish with a heel hook personally where I got them.

Speaker 5:          02:55:51       You know, I'm a big fan of Bruce Lee. Right? I think he's underrated. I think he's a very, versus Uriah. Interesting. I mean it's just, you know, he's tough fight. Yeah. Tough fight. I mean your eye is a veteran. I mean if he does what he did to Mcdonald's, just runs out and makes the street fight, throws him on the ground vintage. That's what I like seeing Uriah do. I W I think derives doing good striking, but I think when he comes out, you're right cave man. Yeah. Alan just chokes people out is that he's kind of a a blueprint for what I want to see a lot of my wrestlers do. Go Punch him, take him down, throw him down, choke him out and let's go home. Fight was probably his finest performance in the icon. That was spectacular. I think older fighters, like he kind of reminds me a little of Oscar de la Hoya, like Oscar switched training with, with Mayweather's dad.

Speaker 5:          02:56:42       And you get bored with certain styles or like you, you put weapons in your arsenal, but sometimes learning new weapons actually hurts you more than helps you. You know what I mean? Cause it gets you confused. Cause yeah, he led are almost too much. I used to do that. I, I, I'd be like, man, I'm really into this technique but it's not helping me. It's actually hurting me. We're running out of time. We've just about hit the three hour mark. Oh, sorry. Yeah. How do people get Ahold of Duke? Roufus University.
