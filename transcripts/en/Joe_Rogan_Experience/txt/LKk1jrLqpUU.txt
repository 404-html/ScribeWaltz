I don't do that. Anytime I'm about a flashlight. It's I'm way past eating out for thing. How often do you prepare and actually like lay out some water. He a bath with the flashlight and the Bab so it soaks in the warm water and you'd have to figure out what's, what's realistic. It's 100 degrees realistic. Are you fucking a girl with a fever? A marathon runner? A girl. Mid Marathon. But I did. I did it once. I did try to heat up a flashlight. I was like, I'm gonna fucking, I put it under the sink and turn it up, turn the water on hot and just let the hot water. It's the same thing. We like, fuck this, I'm fucking this thing. You have to poach it slightly.

Speaker 2:          00:02:25       We'll temperature. What if you had like a, like a crazy fetish for banging a chip that's dying of fever and shit.

Someone out there has it legitimately, you know, there's, there's 7 billion of us now. How many people on it? I don't know. I lost count.

Speaker 2:          00:03:12       We also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot com o n n I t, makers of Alpha brain. I take my Alpha brain before the show. Let's see if I fall apart. I take it before anything important. What is it? It's a, it's a neutral beck. I take it every day essentially, but I make sure I take it, but like before I beat to the UFC, I take three or four of them before I do comedy and take three or four of them. Usually I only take like two in a day, maybe four. But what it is is a nootropics are, and by the way, this is just me. I mean it's, it's not dangerous yet. None of these levels of dangerous, but you might not like it. You might think it makes you too jittery. I've had like I've taken three before in a row and I'm like, man, this makes me feel like a little edgy.

Speaker 2:          00:03:55       Almost like I'm caffeine down a little bit, but usually two, two is good. Two is good for stand up, two's good for anything. Anything intense is going to take more than four or five hours, usually take three. Nowadays they also seem to combat hangovers. It's great for jet lag too. We'll do whatever the fuck's going on in your brain when it's not working that well. Obviously there's a lack of something. What is that? I Dunno, but these, these nutrients, supposedly the science behind it is that it helps your body produce human neuro transmitters in May. It helps you produce all the, you know, all the shit that makes your brain fire. Yeah. It's, what's that stuff called? It's called [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:04:34       doesn't it have, what's the shit you take after you take ecstasy the next day?

Speaker 2:          00:04:38       Oh yeah, I be five HTP is a nootropic. Yeah, that's the thing we have called new mood. Five HTP m also El Tryptofan because ultra defend converts to five HTP and the body and that enhances your body's ability to produce serotonin. Yeah. There's ways you can manipulate the levels of nutrients in your body and it has an effect, a real effect on the way your brain works. But don't just listen to me please Google nootropics and there's a lot of other companies out there that have real good products. I mentioned Bill Graham analyses and neuro one. I liked that one a lot and it's got like a little caffeine in it. Um, if she, at least mine. Really? Yeah. What's it called? Pain at brain. The them, the guy jerks off logo and sharks. These responsibilities makes

Speaker 3:          00:05:26       it so that you can easily share gear with spot without feeling guilty. Like before I would play world for like four hours straight and I feel terrible. Now I'm Beta brain. I can play world of Warcraft for two days straight shit myself. Shred them guilt. It's great stuff guys. You compartmentalize essentially. Yeah, you can't, you just don't feel the guilt. You just let it go. The guilt just gets blocked. It's gone wrong. Naps. You could jerk off five times a day without feeling like a loser on Beta. Brain waves break, check it out. We'll be, we'll be looking into that as well.

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       If you're interested in alphabet, Joe rugged.net, click on the link, enter in the code name Rogan and you will get 10% off any and all orders. We're, we're absolutely not trying to rip anybody off with any of this stuff and that's the reason why we have a 100% money back guarantee on the first order of 30 pills. When you buy it, if you ride it, you don't even have to send it back. Just so this stuff sucks. Give me my money back. We are now trying to rip anybody off. This is all stuff I would be taken whether or not I had any financial stake in the company.

Speaker 3:          00:06:30       Uh, with Beta brain, I have frank, no financial stake in the company and with the first 50 pills you order, you get a lavender scented face mask.

Speaker 2:          00:06:40       It should be with Beta brain for the first, you know, first three years of the company. All of the money goes to all of your ex's anyway.

Speaker 3:          00:06:48       Yeah, that's right. Yeah. It's flowers. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:06:51       Could you imagine if that was the way the world works? If you, you entered into contracts and you know, as you, as you left, like you would have to agree to be with this woman or pay for this one for 10 years and then don't have sex with you.

Speaker 3:          00:07:04       What if is what's just with friendship? What if you had to get married to your friend and being friends with people you have to like sign a contract with like we're going to be friends forever.

Speaker 2:          00:07:14       Yeah. And you can't just miss miss him on a weekend once or twice. You gotta do what I'm constantly,

Speaker 3:          00:07:19       no, and if you fucking break that contract that you got to keep your friend like 10% of your anchor.

Speaker 2:          00:07:26       I bet people have done, I mean isn't that what gay marriage as essentially it's just friends or fuck each other cause they're dudes.

Speaker 3:          00:07:31       I think that's what marriage is, right? Yeah. Fuck each other. That's why having a girlfriend is, it's a friend that you fuck, right girl. I took our old friend, that's how they call it. It's just a friend that you like to put your Dick inside of what it is. Yeah, absolutely. So now that act of doing that at the moment you put your cock inside, somebody changes the game. Yeah. Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:07:56       Anyway, enough about Alpha brain talk. That commercial, it's essentially over right now. Well, there's new mood, shroom tech, sport, True Tech, Moon and Alpha brain and all the different things that we saw it on it. O N N I t.com coming up, we got kettlebells and a bunch of other cool nutritional things.

Speaker 3:          00:08:15       You know, Beta brain also has a mood enhancing drug. It's called blue mode. It makes it so that you can like really listen to Elliot Smith. Love it.

Speaker 2:          00:08:26       I wonder if the, if the, if someone could sell pills that made you depressed and he would buy him, he would buy them. I mean, look at what it's cigarettes once or something that makes you feel like shit and smelled terrible. And yet there though, like it's super popular. Kills people and it's super popular. If you had depression pills and you just had them out there, yeah, it would be like a news story. News at five is this new pill crossing the line. It's marketed as depression. And then you go there and there's a chick with white makeup on a black lipstick and she goes, life fucking sucks. It's always fucking sucked. Okay. And when I take these pills, I see Audi and that's what I want. If you are, I get, fuck. Yeah. Yeah. What is wrong with the children of today is this depression drug crossing the line.

Speaker 3:          00:09:11       Happiness is annoying when you're around happy people, they're fucking irritating. If you're happier fucking piece of shit. Yeah. What are you, what's there to be happy about? You're going to fucking die in a few years. Russian wars raging everywhere. You really going to walk around with a smile on your face and this economy.

Speaker 2:          00:09:28       Well no, it's really good to do. Depression was your girl cause when you get through it and it wears off, it's like he gets a really appreciate how good. How could you have it right when you're getting along great. Yeah, because when you take depression, it's really like going through like one of those life changing experiences. I'm mood African drugs that make you like almost die and then we have a combination of those crazy drugs that they give, like the jungle drugs where you almost die. It's not quite a psychedelic experience. It's almost like a near death experience. Like, literally, literally am most kill you ready? Cool. And you're supposed to like learn something about yourself through, through this intense and horrible poisoning. I think they're called ordeal poisons. That's the actual technical term. And they, um, they, they operate very similar to psychedelics in the way that they humbly, you mean, cause it really brings you to the brink of death and your, your emotions are just blaring your fuse are blaring, your, you know, insecurities. And when, you know, I think you're forced to examine your life in a very deep and realistic way in any real, true near tragic situation. Right? Oh yeah. So I think you take these ordeal poisons and you just go through the ordeal of almost fucking dying and you learned a little bit about yourself, but God dammit, that's the hard way to do it.

Speaker 3:          00:10:48       That is the hard way to do it. But for a lot of people, that's the only way to do it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:10:51       Yeah. They don't have enough love in a psychedelic free environment. I can't get it to them. So they don't have the means to get it to them.

Speaker 3:          00:10:58       Yeah. I mean sometimes even, I mean, people will take psychedelics and still be douche bags.

Speaker 2:          00:11:04       Totally. That guy we were talking about before a show. Yeah. It was a lot of them out there, but they're like, it's almost like by taking it and allows you to be a Twat because you've had the experience and you're allowed to like stick it in someone else's face. It hasn't had the experience of their, their children or their a moron. Like that's, that's, that's crazy. What are, you know, you're not, you're not better for having an experience. You're just more experienced. You know, what, what's better is your overall impact on human beings. And if Justin, your accumulated some extra information so you feel it's okay to be conti, well that's not better at all. You just moved your energy into a different direction. You're not, you're not better. Right. You're still being a Twat.

Speaker 3:          00:11:50       Well, you're still differentiating. Yeah. That's it. That's the, the, um, and the Bhagavad of I get, it sort of talks about like signs of people who've gained real realization. And one of the signs is that they don't differentiate between any anything. It's all, they see it as all an expansion of the same original force. They don't see it anymore. It's like this person's rich, this is person or this person's good, this person's bad. It's all just different, uh, sides and angles and this super structure, there's a existed

Speaker 2:          00:12:23       forever. That's so hard to do, to think that way. It's so hard to separate yourself from, you know, from you and your needs and your, your ideas are you what you want and what you want to accomplish or what or whatever. Yeah. Whenever you associate with you and the idea that you're a part of a whole,

Speaker 3:          00:12:39       well, you could end up actually imagine it really being in that state. The only time I've ever truly been in that state was, uh, when I had taken a huge dose of Lsd and was out in the desert. And I remember just having that fading away merging thing where you no longer anything. You're just, you're, you're everything. You just merge into it all. And I don't know how you would really function in that state. I don't really know what you would be like in the world if he, if, if you've got didn't, if that lasted longer than the amount of time, you know, an acid trip is or a few hours. But they do say that through meditation and through, um, strict yoga disciplines, you can hit that place permanently, you know, and somehow that that place is Nirvana or paradise. It's a beautiful way to be all the time. But I don't know. I haven't, you know, I've only heard stories about people like that descriptions and people like, uh, he was a corpse that the universe spoke through as one great description of wow. You know, or the, the, the ego of the person was dead. They're just gone.

Speaker 2:          00:13:52       But that would probably boring as fuck to hang out with cus the problem. Right. You know, part of what's cool about being a human being is being around people that have some flavor.

Speaker 3:          00:14:03       Yeah. Hell yeah. And you, you know, you see some of these people and they do seem to have flavor. So, you know, I, I don't know the problem with talking about the holy men of the world, the great holy man, if the world is that I've never met one. It's like

Speaker 2:          00:14:17       I've met some want to be gurus, quite a few want to be gurus and some of them, you know, they shock me with they're humorless.

Speaker 3:          00:14:27       You know what though dude, I did do a video chat with Ron Bass. You still, there was a man, that guy was fucking awesome and it lit up. My whole apartment was just you and him. Yeah, it was, no, it was me, him and Natasha. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:14:40       How did you arrange this?

Speaker 3:          00:14:41       Well, on its website you can still do it. It's this thing called heart to hearts where you can like know you can talk to him on Sunday. Wow. And you just go to the website and up. I couldn't believe it either. I thought it was, there was no way it was going to work or I thought they were going to like try to get asked for money from me or something like, but I sign up for it Sunday, my phone rang. Hello Duncan. It's Ron doss.

Speaker 2:          00:15:03       Holy Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:15:04       Yeah. And then suddenly I'm like on this video screen with Ron Doss, and he was glowing. He was like, he's an old dude now that he's, it was like exactly the same energy that my friends, eight year old kids have. It was just this radiant, childlike, authentic energy. It wasn't phony. It wasn't bullshit. Wow. We talked for a little while. He told me, um, this chant that he's been doing lately over and over again where he says, I am loving awareness. I am loving awareness. I am loving awareness. It's a chance to just sort of, I don't know, shift your vibe. And then that was, it said goodbye. And that was it. They didn't ask for any money. They didn't want anything. It was just a wow, you know? Yeah. I was just like service. That's okay.

Speaker 2:          00:15:49       That's fascinating. That's fascinating. Yeah. It's like, look at him and you know, people who, uh, are insane psychedelic enthusiasts. You know, you look at someone like him and you go, there's a guy he made it through. Yes. You made it through. I really grabbed it. Yeah. He really grabbed a hold of the whole thing and it made him something different and made him what he is at the, at the heart of the trip.

Speaker 3:          00:16:10       That's right now. Well, he, because what happened is he went into that state and instead of going into that state and leaving and then that's it. It was a novel experience. He went to that state and said, I want to be in this state permanently. What the fuck is this? Cause he had, you know, he's a trained psychologist and he's like, we don't know what this is. We don't have any maps for this. We don't know what the fuck this psychedelic experiences and all I, so he was trying to, when you went to India, he was trying to see if this was a state that you could permanently reside. He wanted to stay here forever. That's how much he loved tripping. You know, when I come down quite often I'm like, thank you God, I'm back to, you know, stay zero ground. I mean, he was like, okay, let's do this forever. They weren't fucking with him and Timothy weary word like drinking from drinking, sipping viles of acids from LSD. You don't know, are you so fucking deep into the accident, so scary, fearless, fearless, intrepid explorers, but he, you know, he realized that you go into that place, you have this contact or whatever you want to call it with some kind of either hidden interior around or some kind of exterior around that as humans. Our perceptual neck.

Speaker 2:          00:17:34       Yeah man, that's a pretty scientific way of looking at it. Realistically, Interior Realm. Even being just a conscious one, you know, a consciousness realm. You know the fact that those ideas there, none of, why are they not available to me right now? This is if it's all generated interiorly yeah. How come those ideas are not available to be right now? Do I need some intense stimulation of different regions in order to give me that information? Like I don't know how the process works. I'm not exactly sure if other people know either. I have the wound is fucking feeling that when you take psychedelics or when you take even marijuana that you are part of what the experience is, is you experiencing the intelligence of the plant. Part of it is it charged it. It boosts up your own senses into this weird, crazy alien state and that's why being high feel so like disorienting and feels like you're almost like not in your space anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:18:33       You're space is connected with some other intelligence and this other intelligence is showing you different avenues of thinking. It's almost like it, it, it starts filling pores in your mind and pushing you in a certain direction until it wears off and then it wears off and it's alien to your system so your body gets rid of it eventually and then it's gone. It only has a certain certain amount of love time inside of you, but while it's inside of you, it's like it's changing you. It's, it's making you like super fucking sensitive. It's making me super aware and honest, you know? I mean, one, a lot of people say, well it doesn't need to be where it just makes me paranoid. Well maybe that's just how you deal with stress. Cause for sure you're going to get moments if you smoke too much pot. When we feel paranoid, this is no, no, get away with that.

Speaker 2:          00:19:20       Everyone's going to have that experience. But what is that really? Well, tell you what it is, man. It's like you're being, you're being aware of [inaudible] the shit in the world all at once and all of the ship that you were hiding in the back of your head and all the shit that's though your worst nightmare, that you're terrified that you're actually manifesting. Cause you'd think about it all the time and when you smoked pot, all that shit comes to life and on top of that you're just disoriented. You, you, it's, it's like surfing. It's like surfing can be great. Surfing can be like I watched those guys when they look like they're having a great fucking time and I go, God Damn Surfing. It's like fine, but you don't want stuff from, doesn't look like fun. When that wave comes over your fucking head and smashes into the rocks and pulverizes your bones with a million pounds of pressure and you can't get to the surface.

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       Well that's surfing too. Yeah, we'll definitely roll your ass. Oh, you don't know what you're fucking doing. Especially if you fight it and try to fight it at worst. There's people that are fighting reality every day and they often have like a sort of a, a fake map of the world that they've devised in their head and that's how they navigate. They navigate through this fake map of the world, but a lot of the little segments in their mind that they have associated with certain things and details and a lot of it is delusional because you're trying to protect yourself from your own failures. You're all, you know what I mean? Like,

Speaker 4:          00:20:47       especially with men, I think, you know, we have, you know, guys have these fucked up egos that are designed to make sure that you have a will to survive when a cheetah attack sir or fight off a another tribe so that you, your DNA stays in tack weld. That is a fucking creepy thing, just running around through your vans. So

Speaker 5:          00:21:07       yeah. What were we talking about here is what they call it, set and setting, which is like when you're going to take a psychedelic, what's your mind state? What, what's, how, what's your emotional state when you take the psychedelic in? If you go back to the idea that, what's his name? John. Mark Alegra. What's his name? John. Marco. Ron. Yeah, John. Mark. All Allegro talking about early Christianity was a mushroom called. Can you go back and you look at the idea of when you're going to take communion or when you go to pray or when you go to the sacred place, you're supposed to um, forgive your brothers and your sisters because, but so the idea is before you go into a psychedelic state, you need to, as much as you can, work out this shit that you're avoiding. Because when you go into that psychedelic state, anything that you're trying to skip around, any of those aspects of your personality that need to be a level there, needs to be balanced, are going to spring out at you in a million different ways that are really intense.

Speaker 5:          00:22:05       And if you're not prepared for that, then you'll have the bad trip. And the bad trip is you will loose Nate. You can see little see crazy shit. You'll look in the walls and see skulls. Why are you seeing skulls? You know, are you seeing bubbling skulls in the wall where you're seeing bubbling skulls? Cause that's what you're projecting from inside of you because you're fucking scared to death. You're scared to die. You're terrified of letting go. You don't want to, you don't want to, uh, you took, your body doesn't want to die. And then until you deal with that initial thing, then all these other neuroses will spring up after that. You know, your avoidance of reality, all the different weird ways that you're trying to avoid reality, which is essentially just trying to avoid coming to the grant, to the terrain that you're on and the terrain that we're all on, his fucking intense. We're on a terrain where we are going to go extinct. And you know, who knows, depending on how old you are, you know, but and depending on how much technology advances between like 70 and 10 years, two years, one year, that's an intense realm to exist on.

Speaker 4:          00:23:05       Um, I don't know. There's a situation right now and focusing on my, you know, the, the whole thing with the, uh, the fourth reactor or they're terrified that if any seismic event occur, it's a zero chance of surviving ascites seismic event. Right. And we'll do and have another blown reactor and we were talking about it on the podcast and someone made a clip of it and put it on this website where it's like, and people were like discussing this, like this is a serious issue. One thing was that I was saying was that we're going to have spots in this world because of nuclear power were for hundreds of thousands of years it's going to be dead wastelands dead and there's a bunch of them and there's a bunch of more plants out there that could make a bunch more spot dead. And this is just been less than a hundred years we've been doing this and we've already got three giant spots where you can't go to anymore. Have you seen like the places where they store the nuclear rods, they like have special places like caves and they put it in and I believe that they've, on the signs around the place, they actually have like skulls and shit. Everything's still on case society collapses and everyone forgets and thousands of years past you go wandering up to that place and there's this fucking skull and you're you like, you just recognize, okay, this is a cursed place.

Speaker 4:          00:24:22       One of the dumbest, most brilliant ideas ever. It's so dumb and so brilliant. At the same time, humans have a lot of Hubris and it is a ridiculous one though. We're fucking with something that there is no technology to clean it. There's no technology to turn it into anything other than toxic, lethal, horrible killing shit. Yeah, it sucks man. It's like the, the exuberance of when that stuff initially came out and people thought that they discovered endless fuels sources that exuberance like was everywhere. It seemed like a real, it really seemed like the most beautiful. Uh, it seemed like we were entering into utopia for awhile.

Speaker 4:          00:25:12       Did anybody ask them? Like what happens when the power goes off? Somebody who was like, dude, you're being negative. Right? It had to be like some sort of a stupid argument where no one considered the possibility that the power could go off. You could lose both backup generators. You have no other way of fixing those. He just built a son, felt a little tiny son and we were just going to leave it there. That's, that's insane. Well, yeah, I mean you can't call it off. You can't call it off. You can't. It's a demon basically. If summoned the demon, the demon, it is. It really truly is. Like you have some in the demon when we have nuclear power, if you really stop and think about that, if there was some, if a demon existed and in his very presence he was poisoning the environment, no plants could grow.

Speaker 4:          00:25:55       I, and that is a demon by definition. And then when it gets near him, dies a horrible twisted death. That's a demon. This is something people don't understand with like a cult talk where people talk about demons, like so many demons and so many spirits, they dig that shit literally. So they hear someone saying, I, you know, I'll invoke these things to summon a demon. And so then a lot of great movies and been made after that, the literal interpretation of that. But every fucking day, man, not just on a grand scale without so many nuclear power, but in little ways, people fucking summon demons into their life all the time with no thought of how to get rid of it every time. You know, like when people shoot heroin, that's something a fucking demon. Like you've been told by every single other like necromancer is someone that demon, that shit will fuck

Speaker 5:          00:26:43       you up. But people who do heroin and they don't, they always start off with like, you know what? I'm just going to do it once. Just want to see what it feels like. Everyone does that. And then you fucking end up under a fucking bridge with three Cox in your mouth. Oh, from, Oh, from summoning this one stupid fucking demon that is just destroyed so many people and heroin demons, a great word for heroin because it offers you something because so many people they say, oh yeah, fucking a Jimi Hendrix. Love this stuff. Or, or, uh, Elliot Smith, listen how beautiful his music is. You can go on and on about the people who shot heroin and like made beautiful stuff. So there is an exchange. I mean, doesn't that kind of tickle around in your head when he Bruce was blast and this shit, you know, it doesn't, it kind of tickled around. You're like, what the f what? Maybe what is that? Maybe there is a little land, like you rise up and see this landscape that you can't see from the psychedelic perspective

Speaker 4:          00:27:40       and maybe it's a, it doesn't seem to be worth it. Whatever it is, I'll, I'll, I'll look at it as like, what makes you happy? And uh, I don't, I don't see people taking heroin and getting super happy from it. Everyone that I've ever known that did heroin, the come down from it was unbelievably bad. By bone jarring. It would say your bones were, that's how they would describe it.

Speaker 5:          00:28:01       Terrible drug. You know, you never see any like marathon runners who were like shooting.

Speaker 4:          00:28:04       I had a friend who, uh, he was, uh, uh, it was a good buddy of mine that lived in New York and he came to visit me and I didn't know when he was coming to visit me that he was trying to kick heroin. And then he was going to do is just come and hang out with me at my house in California and kick heroin with me. So that's, I did not, no, I didn't. I didn't know how bad he had it. I hadn't seen him in a couple of years. So he, he flew out and the dude was just in bed sick for like six, seven days. He couldn't go anywhere, man. I would get him food and shit and he couldn't go anywhere. He came with me to work one day I was on news radio. He came and just sat around the set, but he couldn't, he couldn't move around. Man, that dude was a, he was jacked.

Speaker 5:          00:28:51       It's amazing to see that, isn't it? It's amazing to see that traps that we set for ourselves in the world that are completely avoidable, but for some reason we always set these traps and then they smash on us and we go through this awful period. And then if you're lucky, you get out on the other side. That kind of goes back to what you were talking about, this idea of like having that near death experience or having this awful catastrophe happened in your life. If you handle it the right way, you can become a million times stronger and back from that catastrophe. People don't realize that. So they're always putting off what could essentially be the thing that makes them happier than they've ever been in their life.

Speaker 4:          00:29:30       Well, it's kind of a weird way of looking at it. I mean, you can, you could possibly be happy because of a gastro or it could be horrible. You could lose someone we love, you know, I don't think all catastrophes and unnecessarily too great, not great revelations, but I think occasionally it can give you an enhanced perspective. Something that happens to you. I mean, the most interesting people that we all know are people that have gone through a lot of shit in their life. You know, a lot of crazy experiences, you know, know those, the having to overcome terrible things in places is sort of what makes them exceptional.

Speaker 5:          00:30:07       That's right, man. But there's a, there's a certain group of people who liked to live pretending that catastrophes will never happen to them. Right. This is a ridiculous,

Speaker 4:          00:30:19       yeah. The people that are overweight smoking every day and I have a friend who is, I guess he like 16 and uh, he, he smokes two packs a day and he'll tell you when he's always like making excuses. Like they've even said no, that a, it's all either you have the gene or you do not. So there's a lot of people that will smoke cigarettes and never, I'm in smoking cigarettes for 40 years. I am. I did the, I wish I don't have the gene or I don't, I have cancer. I went to the doctor, my doctor says, you look great, you look great. The doctors looking at you and he's like, you smoke how much a day? And you're like two bags. And he's like, you look great. You look great. Get the fuck out of here. When is he going to do to somebody who's fucking intentionally poisoning themselves all day, intentionally poison yourself all day.

Speaker 4:          00:31:02       Not even just one pack. You Glutton, glutton, nicotine vampire, two packs a day, all day. Of course your doctor's going to tell you what great. You look great. Get the fuck Outta here. I'm gonna see you soon though, bitch. And then we'll be back soon and we'll be back for some crazy shit. I'm calling my uncle up, right? Yeah. My uncle is an oncologist and then we've got our eye on you. That's amazing. Yeah, that's incredible. I never thought I had a lot of money makers. Smokers are for doctors. Well course. I mean if you're a doctor, you want your people. Well, if you are a real doctor, I mean it's obviously people that don't operate for money, you know the operate because they love being an excellent surgeon or an excellent doctor. And you know, we're not disparaging the medical profession at all, but if you were like some money grubbing crazy doctor, but there are a few of those out there, right? Yeah, I've heard of them. Yeah, there's every now and then there was some money grubbing like Michael Jackson's doctor. Dude, that fucking crazy. Yeah Man, I've got fucking fillings in my mouth. Oh, they don't need to be there.

Speaker 5:          00:32:03       Cause my dentist, as it turns out with giving unnecessary failing,

Speaker 4:          00:32:08       so I've got like, I got fucking monster

Speaker 5:          00:32:12       kid. I just thought, I was like, I just thought I, I naturally was always getting cavities. Oh my God. You know what I mean? I was always getting, I was getting blasted with fucking right.

Speaker 4:          00:32:22       Last Guy's ruining kids' teeth join and the kids too and making money. I hope he's in jail. He's in jail.

Speaker 5:          00:32:28       No. What happened to him when, when that scandal hit? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:32:30       That's not just fraud. I'm, I'll beat the fuck out of you. Drove holes in my kids had it didn't need to be there because you're trying to make money like that. Fucking judge. I wouldn't want to beat the fuck out of that dentist.

Speaker 5:          00:32:41       Great to match his fucking head. White. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:32:43       Imagine anybody that would do that to a little kid. Yeah. Just to make some money.

Speaker 5:          00:32:47       Sure. That's a big, this is something that, this is a facet of reality. So scary. Imagine like what mine state do you have to be in, especially your fucking dentist. You already making great money. Like why do you need the extra dough?

Speaker 4:          00:33:02       Exactly. Oh what? I mean how, oh Jesus Christ. How can you justify that? That would move. I would never sleep. I would have to, however I have to find that guy in prison. I might get a wasted just so I can go to prison with him. Oh, find out what prison needs. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:33:17       I underground by now.

Speaker 4:          00:33:19       I mean if it was my kid, you know what I'm saying? I mean I would literally, I would want to get arrested and put in a sell near him to so I could beat the fuck out of him after he got arrested. Yeah. Well there's a lot of it just wouldn't be able to deal with it. Some guy with drilling and we're baby's head to try to make himself some extra scratch. Yeah. Cause we're asked to be a big shot at a restaurant and buy a nice bottle of wine. Is that what's going on? Sure. Fucking asshole.

Speaker 5:          00:33:44       Yeah. I mean, who knows? But think of it, I think to me is like that there was a, a lot of people out there who live like that.

Speaker 4:          00:33:51       Sure. There's a lot of people have done, doesn't associate press. I mean, you've seen the studies. There's, there's been, you know, the, I believe it was time magazine or someone recently had some article about a new book that's out there. It was something like one in a hundred, none of the hundred people just fucking sociopath.

Speaker 5:          00:34:07       So remember the guy who recently went rampaging through that kid's camp? Was it? Where was it? Norway? Was it your way? Yeah. Oh wait, you went rampaging through that camp? Just killing fucking, yeah. And over there they don't, they're not like the United States don't have a death penalty. So like they're giving this guy, it's for a fair trial and they made a big show of the fact that we're going to do this. There's not going to be some kind of a crazy visceral response to this. And so in the trial, the guy, uh, apparently is going into a detailed account of how we went walking through this camp and shock kids who are hiding from him and shot kids and how they tried to run and how he found some of them by thinking where he would hide if he was one of these kids and he's enjoying it. He's getting off on it because he's a sociopath. It feels good for him to tell the story. So in these situations, sometimes I think has passivism gone too far in this situation? The guy clearly shot a bunch of kids. The guy, why do we need to discover if his true motivation or what his real crime was? We know what the crime was. There's a bunch of dead kids because of this guy went rampaging through sometimes. Don't you think you can go too far on the side of 100%? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:35:25       Well, we'll live with the Dalai Lama man. Dot. Randall seems like a great guy, but he's never gotten a blow job in his life. We know it's a stupid wedding and he says he doesn't know sex. Oh, he does. Yeah. So is it doesn't have relations and it says like, he sees it, he's attracted to her, but he was too much work. It's just, you know, he laughs about it. That's, but that's silly. That's silly. You're missing out on a big chunk of life. I think he's got some posey. Well, I would hope so. I wouldn't hate him for it. I think it would be a good thing. But he's a month.

Speaker 6:          00:35:55       There's nothing. Yeah. But I mean, isn't that like part of the whole thing was the seller was saying the idea that, you know, you're beyond the needs of the flash.

Speaker 5:          00:36:01       Yeah. There's like the, I mean, I don't, I honestly, I've heard with Tibetan Buddhism that there's some tantric sex that happens in there and uh, and, and yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:36:09       we should probably Google this, right? Yeah. Is the Dalai Lama and the Dalai Lama salivate. So all of, I love to know that. Yeah. It seems like an interesting question. This keyword socks at fat duck.

Speaker 5:          00:36:26       I, I mean, I guess that I can understand why monks say to be celibate, if, if there's no more, if it's not an ethical decision. I understand like the complication that can come from fucking people is ridiculous. Spectacular. It's come flash durations like lifelong can flag durations. You can bring up being in the life.

Speaker 6:          00:36:48       Yeah, you can. It's a really pain. It's a pain in the ass.

Speaker 5:          00:36:51       Yeah. It's a pain in the fucking ass man.

Speaker 6:          00:36:53       He's not only supposed to be a virgin. Yeah, he's a version. Yeah. Well there you go ladies with Dalai Lama's origin dude. Have you

Speaker 5:          00:37:02       heard about that glue in India that you blast into your boss? The clog up your seminar?

Speaker 4:          00:37:08       Yeah. You sent it to me. Yeah. And so at that, is that what it is? It's load glue,

Speaker 5:          00:37:12       load glue. It's the new male birth control that apparently uh, not as permanent is getting, have a sec. To me it lasts between five and 10 years, but they essentially just put airplane glue or some kind of gel and deer. They just pull you up so you can't, you're just doesn't have the fucking worms in anymore.

Speaker 6:          00:37:34       That's you're, you're repurposing your loads.

Speaker 4:          00:37:38       How could that possibly mean by your load smell like fucking Zombie baby as well? It's probably smell like rubber met. Could you imagine if that was like the beginning of the next fucking 28 days later type movie? It turns out that the shoot some shit and two loads and, but it wouldn't makes a Zombie babies. Yeah, but either way. Are you a person? Good. That's a great harm. Bites the doctor. Nothing. The doctor becomes a Zombie Zombie. Dr fucking furiously attacks all the nurses. They stab each other becoming to a fucking puddles. Slippery a blog, a bunch of Zombie fucking doctors biting each other and shit. All from one fucking Zombie baby. Oh from one Zombie baby from one Zombie low that was created by this crazy drug in an Indian doctor. Just a tornado of infection spreads through the nation from this one hot point. Well we don't call in Dustin Hoffman and her fucking space suit, but you know, he knows that he just had that

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       procedure done to his boss and he like shot a load and to his girlfriend and she's pregnant. So like this is fence through the movie is wondering if his girlfriend, he's got a Zombie baby and her, this is a great movie. Great movie directors out there. Let's just make sure

Speaker 4:          00:38:50       whoever made Trollhunter please contact Trollhunters. Great. It's really fun man. I know. I love that movie, but it's a fun movie. It was the one, the foreign one, right? One in subtitles.

Speaker 5:          00:39:04       Oh wait, no. I thought you were talking about the worst movie ever made.

Speaker 4:          00:39:07       No, this is actually not that bad. It's about a guy who goes and hunts trolls. Does like rich, real live trolls. The woods. It's a, yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:39:14       Oh, Trollhunters. Yeah. Trollhunter yeah, it's really good. It's really fun. And it's shot like found footage. Yes, exactly. Yeah. Troll hunters. That Beth was really good. It's a fun movie or movies like that. Yeah, that one. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:39:27       I love stupid movies, man. Like I'm so looking forward to the Avengers. So much so, but I feel like I'm getting away with something by being able to watch it. Yeah. Like I'm 44 years old at a certain point in time. I'm supposed to be past that. I was supposed to be, you know, interested in mature things, but I'm not, I want to watch the Hawk fuck somebody up.

Speaker 5:          00:39:44       Let me tell you though, that fucking idea of maturity or how you're supposed to act at some certain age. What the fuck is that idea? Because the way you're supposed to act is so boring. Like it's basically saying just act like, act like you're going to, you're just a dying old piece of shit. You don't like fucking super insane special effects anymore. You certainly don't like video games. Kids with their music these days. You go to bed at 10 you know like fuck that. What it goes idea was that anyway, that was just like a control freak. Boring guys. Like this is how an adult rx,

Speaker 4:          00:40:19       yeah. Well it gets to a certain point in time when you compromise your thinking every day. So much so for work, you know, if you, if you have to go in and everyday you got to sell vacuum cleaners and you're a dude, I guarantee you there's some days when you don't want to go in and sell fucking vacuum cleaners. You don't want to not swear all day. You don't want to wear a tie, but you got it. That's part of the job. And so one of the ways to sort of keep that going. Well you don't, you're extreme isn't it? Like the make the whole rest of your life less extreme as well. No more fun shit that need, you need a sensible car. You can't drive a Mustang. You know? You need to stop getting drunk on the weekends. You've got a job. Got to become SFW.

Speaker 4:          00:40:57       Yeah. Safe for work. Say for work. Yeah. And that's why they were allowed to drug test you. Yeah. That's one of the most incredible things that we've let happen this country. Employers are allowed to drug test their employees. That's insane. The idea that someone you play, you pay for a person's work, you don't own their flesh. You don't own them as a human being. And especially when we're talking about stuff like medical marijuana, which is actually supposed to be legal in California. There's a lot of places where you still can't get a medical marijuana prescription. You can't get an exemption and worked for a lot of different companies. Yeah, they won't. They won't have it. They won't hire you. They don't want any products.

Speaker 5:          00:41:36       Yeah. It's a, it's a, it's a real problem because with corporations, I just learned this word and I really fucking love it. It's called diffusion of responsibility, which is the idea that incorporations their responsibility gets so many people make decisions on things that no one person's to blame. Right, right. So, you know, when the corporation, somewhere in the corporation, not everyone's anti marijuana, just a couple of cots and you don't know who they are, but they got that in there. They're all, you know, at some meeting they just got it in and where other people didn't agree with them and they didn't speak up. That's what's annoying about it. You know, that this is coming from just a few dipshits. The majority of people have no problem with it. Fucking Nancy Polosi did you see she came out against Obama? Did you see that shit? What she do? She fucking with, she pointed out the fact that Obama is busted more dispensaries than Bush did. Wow. Cause she's pro medical marijuana and she talked about all the help. Oh and how many people are actually helps in like what the fuck is Obama doing? Why is the arresting all these people? Yeah. When we voted on it, you know

Speaker 4:          00:42:39       diffusional responsibility as another place that's used. Yes. That's an rape.

Speaker 5:          00:42:44       Oh yeah. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:42:46       One person is much more likely to be able to rape another person when there's a big group of people around. Yeah. Because nobody knows who should act first and everybody feels like it's not their responsibility because there's so many people,

Speaker 5:          00:42:59       you always got to act first. That's the role. Oh, exact first. If you see someone in the fucking street who doesn't look like they're doing okay, stop and ask them if they're okay. If you see somebody's car's fucked up on the side of the road, not a flat, right. If it's the first song be

Speaker 4:          00:43:14       well, if you go, are you okay? And that fucking bitch leans over and bite your arm in half and blood screaming. You're screaming as you're driving to a hospital, you turn into a Zombie and crashed into a tree.

Speaker 5:          00:43:24       Look man, there's like a 90% chance if you see someone on the street and try to help them that their prior to the first Zombie.

Speaker 4:          00:43:29       It could happen. It could be the other 10% hey man, look, I'm not taking any chances when the Zombie apocalypse hits. You don't want to be fucking patient. Zero. That's what I'm saying.

Speaker 5:          00:43:41       You see a rape happening and you try to stop it and it was just a dude trying to rape a Zombie.

Speaker 4:          00:43:46       Well Zombie trying to up a dude. That'd be a lot scarier because if like gravy zombies were doing was raping us, army go. He's an idiot. Why would you want to rape on Max the next evolution of bombing cause we made him right now will be raped. It's B. Yeah. That's like ultimate fighting champion. That's not bad ass enough. You didn't need to be a Zombie raper yeah. Have you ever raped a Zombie? And the thing about raping a Zombie as they'll fight hard, but no one cares if you beat the shit out of them and be like led zombies, loosen the field and you could just go beat the shit out.

Speaker 5:          00:44:17       No Dude, this is a sketch. I actually wrote a sketch like this. Promise zombies can infect you, right? Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:44:23       How's that work? That doesn't make any sense. Only 28 days later, zombies can affect you. Well know the biological. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:44:29       there's different, there's different ex ex explanations and the walking dead's got a really fucking good one that I, it's the liquid spoil a lot of shit to say it, but there's a lot of different explanations for it. That's really, that's pretty cool. The way that the creators of these stories come up with like what it is, right? It's, I mean there's no rule for it. It could be anything. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:44:47       but it does in the walking dead. It's a biological thing where in fact people, but there's movies where they come out of the ground, so obviously that's not what's happened though. Those are different ones.

Speaker 5:          00:44:58       That's like, I mean, which ones did they come out of the ground? That's return of the living dead. Yeah, that kind of Shit. I favor God. Yeah. Movies. Fucking it's, you know why it was great cause the zombies can fucking talk. So remember they had that lady strapped to the table. Spoiler alert. They had that lady strapped to the table. It was like a halfway. Do you remember that? And they're like, they asked her because no one's asked the Zombie. They asked her, why do you eat brains? Remember that? It's like, wow, stop, stop paying off debt. Oh my God dude. Cause we never get to really interview a Zombie.

Speaker 4:          00:45:35       I remember that now. Yeah, that's right. They would call out brain. Great. That's such a good, Ooh, that was a great, I mean I was, I was confusing that with night of the living dead look, maternal living dead is actually better

Speaker 5:          00:45:49       return of the living dead. I pop out of Grapes of the living dead. As I recall. We sit the opening of night of the living dead. Remember it's in the graveyard and he's trying to scare his girlfriend and she's like, who's that man walking back there? And there's some dude kind of walking far away. This zombies couldn't walk fast, right? And so we just Kinda ambles up to the guy and like it throws him down. The guy hits his head on a grave stone and then she's like driving away in terror. But we never know if that Zombie emerged from a coffin. I think that was somebody who is like, I don't think, I don't think it, yeah. First of all, you're not going to get out of a fucking coffin if you're a Zombie zombies. They're already week 10 week. Well the 90 little are all very nice. We were living dead zombies week, slow lumbering, purely retarded.

Speaker 4:          00:46:38       So if you were like a really good kick boxer, you could probably like keep a lot of mafia easily. This is a lot leg kick.

Speaker 5:          00:46:46       It's simple moat as simple mode would fix. Most of them say by you and you're fucked, right? You're fucked. You're a Tommy. Now, if you get bitten by a Zombie years on that night of the living dead as well, that's not living dead return of the living dead. I think all of them share the idea that if you get bitten by one, you turn it into one.

Speaker 4:          00:47:03       Huh? I thought, hmm, but you had to die. And some of them, oh, when you come back as well, I think in all of them or all of them and living on 28 days later, remember you just get one byte in your frock. Remember when that chick hatched? Did her boyfriend, she machete one and he's like, it was just a scratch and she just fuck you and just boom, boom with a fucking machete. She machete dem in the kitchen. That was radical. Remember that was such a good fucking great fucking movie. That's the greatest Saudi movie of all time. 28 days later. My opinion is the greatest cause. It's the most original, the whole scene where the guy wakes up and he doesn't know what the fuck is going on. That's really the same scene that the walking dead is used. They've used the same sort of thing. This guy wakes up in the hospital and he doesn't realize that the world was turned to a fucking Zombie shit hole. That's how do you get to do that? Um, that's sort of the same scene as 20 days later.

Speaker 5:          00:47:57       You know, what I to we'd have to look into is, which came first 28 days later or the walking dead comics, comics. So whichever came, well, let's find out walking dead comics, walking dead comics by them. If you haven't, there's still fucking good. How many years do you think they'd been around for? I don't know, but I like for a long time. There's a lot of them and it's, it's at the show is good. I love the show and the show gets a little too soap opera like, but the fucking comics, they're just brutal. And just if you, if you haven't, download them to your iPad and by him cause they're fucking awesome.

Speaker 6:          00:48:32       Mm. It's Wikipedia. Yeah. We're living in a fucking beautiful time, man. Some guy, uh, said something really recently. Uh, um, I'll go look at it after I figured this out. 2003 is what is a first issue of the walking dead comics. So now let's look up return the living dead. No, no. 28 days later. Oh yeah, yeah. Sorry, Tony. I think that was earlier. I'm pretty sure, but I'm just guessing. Let's see. 2002. Hmm. Ooh, it's earlier sign of a bitch. Yeah. Well that's so close that it might've been parallel thinking. Yeah, I know. Who knows these guys. First of all, it's kind of like, if you want to make a Zombie movie about a big apocalypse, wouldn't a cool way to do it to be wake up and, yeah. I mean, everybody's afraid. You wake up and you're going to get up in the morning and nuclear bombs had already dropped.

Speaker 5:          00:49:34       You know what else it serves, what purpose it serves is you don't have to explain how it happened as you started the big [inaudible] guy waking up. So you don't really have to go into the hall what ship proceeding it, which by the way, I fucking love dawn of the dead. Oh yeah. Remember dawn of the dead and the fucking news studio remember that? And it's all falling apart. It's just starting to fall the fuck apart and people are trying to like rationalize what's happening and swat teams are going in and just blowing the shit out of people and the all of society is collapsing. I love that. I like starting at the collapse of society and then going into that post apocalyptic state. I hate movies that are the lead up to the disaster. We're like 80% of the movie is like the lead up and then you just get 20% of apocalypse. I like fucking 90% apocalypse.

Speaker 4:          00:50:24       Well, what's a really cool movie? Like, it's weird. It's very, it's called Ponti Pool. It's a, I think it's a Canadian movie and it's about, um, these people that are, um, they're, they're in a radio studio. The whole show takes place. The whole movie takes place in like essentially one scene. It's one area. It's all in this radio studio. They're trapped in there while this Zombie apocalypse is raging to their town. Yeah. It's pretty fucking cool. Fucking cool, man. They're the people that were working with them become infected and they're trapped in the sound booth. They realize that these things are blind or they can hear you and they could smell you. And they like trying to get at them to the glass. It's pretty fucking cool man. It's like a real low budget sort of a movie. But it was, I found to be pretty original dude, if you know what I'm saying. It's like one of those, you want to watch something creepy. That's why something creepy nights.

Speaker 5:          00:51:15       Yeah, that's it. If you've seen, um, uh, the road or read the road,

Speaker 4:          00:51:20       do you that's the, uh, Hugo Vigo Morgan. I watched that up until the point when he was teaching his son how to shoot himself in the mouth. And I was like, check please.

Speaker 5:          00:51:30       I think the author of that book was Cormac Mccarthy. I think I remember the name of the book was insane. But that fucking movie man, to me that really captured what it's gonna look like, if at all. I'm sure that's what it fucking looks like. Just want people just desperately trying to find food. Cause even the walking dead like there's trying to find food but somehow like they always end up, I guess they were on a farm in part of it. They end up with some pretty nice home cooked meals and people see, you know people are like, yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:51:59       people have like set ups where they have big fences and

Speaker 5:          00:52:02       yeah, and they look crossbar. They've been taking vitamins and going on a fucking treadmill they have because they're actors but the fucking the road. The road man. Yeah. Nobody looks good.

Speaker 4:          00:52:15       Yeah. It looks like they told him nobody to eat for days before you shoot. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:52:19       Pale and stressed out and like man this,

Speaker 4:          00:52:23       that would be the way to do it too. If you are going to be one of those method guys and it was Gary Oldman motherfuckers. Yeah, I bet he would not eat for a couple days.

Speaker 5:          00:52:31       Yeah. I mean you don't eat and you drink a lot of fucking coffee and you lose a lot of sleep and you get no a nice fatigued state of stress because that's what it is. That's what it's going to be like, man. It's going to be fucking pure stress. You're probably going to die. You're probably going to get arrested. You're probably going to watch your friend die. You're probably going to watch your girlfriend get raped by some fucking super powerful you would do or just like fuck it, and it's not going to be like the criminals that you see on Mad Max, they're going to be dumber than those. It's just going to be dumb. People who have power, just dumb people with a gun. That's going to be the problem when the fucking grid shuts down

Speaker 4:          00:53:10       and it is entirely within the realm of possibility. It's ignored, but it's entirely within the realm of possibility. This is so fragile. We have a house made of toothpicks and tissue paper. It's on the edge of a cliff. Yeah. In relationship to how our civilization is set up and structured for longevity in this incredible volatile galaxy, and it's incredibly volatile solar system, just the planet itself, all the natural shit that can go down and on top of it, other done fucking shit that we're doing like nuclear power.

Speaker 5:          00:53:46       Let me tell you something, dude. People are fucking assholes. Walking proof of that. Go check out the dark ages. Go look at what the Catholic Church did. The RSPS. This is where it gets crazy about the Catholic church. The Catholic church molested our species when they were in their teens, when, when our species was just fucking getting shit going. That Catholic Church came in and just started torching people burning people, killing people left and right, wiping out entire civilizations, all in the name of Jesus and all of this from an interpretation of the fucking, uh, New Testament, uh, which is Pauline theology from a guy who never met Christ. And some people speculate, uh, the real disciples thought he was a liar. Call them a liar, called the Paul Liar, which is why when you look at the pistols from Powell, a lot of times he's defending himself. He's like, I'm not a lot. I mean, why would you say this to me? Because the real disciples were like, hey dude, who the fuck are you?

Speaker 4:          00:54:46       So he was like a late night infomercial sales, right?

Speaker 5:          00:54:49       There you go. Exactly. And that shit got adopted by the Roman Empire because they wanted to go to war and they just were like, yeah, let's use this. We can use this. Let's figure out a way to make love your neighbor as yourself and love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, and soul and to going into the Middle East and stealing all their goal. Let's figure out how to do that. Oh, I know. Here's an idea. I know there are events. Let's go over there and kill the mother fuckers and the name of the guy who said don't kill anybody.

Speaker 4:          00:55:18       No, I've had this, I had this really intense series of conversations with people about conspiracy theories lately, both pro and con like having Brian Cowen and doesn't believe in any conspiracy theory and Eddie Bravo who believes in a lot of conspiracy theories, but the most fascinating thing to me is how many people will just blatantly dismiss conspiracy theories like, like nine 11 is my favorite one. You cannot dismiss nine 11 as a conspiracy theory because it was a conspiracy that caused nine 11 from the enemy in the first place. Okay. Someone conspired some big event and made some human beings, made planes fly into buildings and a bunch of people died. That is a fact. The idea that that no one could conspire to do that. It's ridiculous because it had to be, it had to be a conspiracy in order for it to happen in the first place. It's a lot of people involved. They had to keep their mouth shut. They had a pass information through in jpeg form. They would fucking send things to each other by sending each innocuous looking emails with pictures in them and then people would take those pictures and open them up in in a program that would allow to see writing in between the ones and Zeros of the image.

Speaker 5:          00:56:33       Yes, and you might come up that. Here's the thing, I always, it's pretty dope. I always look at this shift from the perspective of like whenever you get to be in at any kind of corporation, if you go to a high enough level, you realize that people stop following the same rules that everybody writes. File it. Like, I can remember, I used to work at this summer camp in North Carolina, um, called camp panicle. And I can remember like I went to, I went to camp there too as a camper. But I can remember at one point, um, I can remember at one point at being a counselor and then like the people who ran the camp came during the time when all the kids are supposed to be taking naps to my cat. I'm like, Hey, come on. And then we went out in the lake and just floated on inner tubes and I was like, fuck, this is breaking all the rules. But it's the people running again breaking the rules. So it's totally cool. But that's tiny, tiny Mike my sample. But it's the same thing all over the place up top where it's like, look dude, don't worry about that cocaine charge. Like, oh, how much do you owe in taxes? Don't worry about that. We'll take care of that. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:57:33       Well how about when presidents leave office and then dismiss a whole bunch of people who these pardons presidents are allowed? Like, just give wide open pardon stuff, gang of people for doing all kinds of creepy shit. Yeah. Why did they get to do that? You know, it's a crazy rule. You, you get to bypass the whole legal system and they have like a list. It's not just one person. Like they have a, they have a personal, cause there was a guy who was unjustly cues and I think this man needs to be pardoned and no, no, no, no. It's not that. There's a list. They get like 20 or 30 of them or something crazy. Oh sure man. How many do they get to a pardon? I don't have it there. I'm just not that bad. It's not bad. There's some fucking checks coming in though, because I feel like, I feel like somebody is abused it recently. Like maybe Clinton, how many presidents, how many pardons does the president get? Cause that would it be, yeah, the guy. This keyboard

Speaker 5:          00:58:23       sucks. That's crazy though, man. That is crazy. So yeah, I think fucking conspiracies happen because they happen in the smallest levels of society. Why wouldn't they happen at the highest levels in society?

Speaker 4:          00:58:33       Yeah, totally. Yeah, of course, man. It's everywhere you go man.

Speaker 5:          00:58:38       People like are operating under the illusion that politicians are honest or don't like

Speaker 4:          00:58:43       presidents can pardon as many people as they want

Speaker 5:          00:58:47       so they could pardon everyone? God Dang, you were the president. Like if Obama got pissed and went out of office is the last attack he can be like I'm pardoning every prisoner in every prison over the counter.

Speaker 4:          00:59:00       Yo Dude sweat this. President Clinton issued 456 executive clemency orders, 395 pardons and 61 confrontations between 93 and January 20th of 2001 President Bush has 191 pardons. Jimmy Carter granted amnesty to all Vietnam era draft Dodgers. Wow, that's cool. That's pretty beautiful.

Speaker 5:          00:59:28       So Obama, when he gets out of office, he could pardon all people in there for medical marijuana

Speaker 4:          00:59:34       dodged the draft in Vietnam. Ted Nugent. It's Kinda crazy cause just like he's such a pro war guy, but there's a, a depiction of what he did. I don't know if it's true, but uh, I mean he definitely didn't go to war and now he's like super pro war as he's gotten older pro or is it a weird stance? Well, the idea of pro America, I mean, look, if we really were living in the game of Thrones, you better be fucking pro America. You know, you better be like down for this one team because otherwise some Dothraki horde from the other side of the world might fucking hop on a ship and come over and Jack. Yet it was very important back then. But as we're connected by the Internet, the idea of countries is becoming less and less relevant. It's all about local government laws and the, the whole world is one big fucking connection. The whole world is one big piece. That's why all these people in the Middle East are freaking out. That the real rally and cry for freedom is coming from the Internet. That's how the use the Twitter and they using Facebook to communicate with and all that's all emanating from the Internet.

Speaker 5:          01:00:40       Oh Man, I heard this thing and I like, I never read it. I think a teacher told me this and I never explored it. I'm sure I'll find out now though, but it was this idea that about communism and how Karl Marx said that real communism was going to be a natural evolution of society and a real communism, not something imposed. Right. Something that's just a natural, obvious result of people getting smarter and I'm understanding the way things work

Speaker 4:          01:01:07       and calming it. Money aids and a lot of things. What it does is it gives you an incentive to innovate. It gives you an incentive to work hard. It gives you something to show a score, which a lot of people like to see if you want innovation. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:01:21       right. I'm not, I'm definitely need, certainly not a communist. I know, I know you're not, I'm not, I'm definitely not anti money, but what, what, what I'm starting to see happening is that the more that you work and like little collectives with people, the more you help the people around you, you know, as much as you can, just the people directly around you, the more that group rises up and succeeds. Right. And this idea of the new form of like podcast networks, which is where you have like, um, like, uh, like, like my friend, he's doing a podcast network called feral audio and ideas. It's just a group of people that are like, uh, plugging in together and like sharing, sharing profits. This is the new model of things. It's a collective, right? Artists and people. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:02:09       You know, I mean I'm not sure if the podcast world represents a microcosm of the entire, no. Well No, no, no. So here's the thing. This is what's beautiful

Speaker 5:          01:02:18       about, and this is why I bring it up

Speaker 4:          01:02:19       is a new thing. The reason that it's the reason we can do podcasts and the reason like you, like you just shot your own special on your own and the re like seeing comedian shoot there on, on special honors because we have more access to technology, right. Then we have before and technology shrinking, eating smaller, which is basically creating a situation where collectives form instead of the pyramid Illuminati, top down power structure where someone owns the equipment and gets a, the majority of the dub. Do you know what I'm saying? It's like everything's shifting, widening out, spreading out. And that's, that's why these fucking tyrants in the Middle East, it doesn't work when people have information. Right. Doesn't work well. You know, I've always, I remembered, uh, when they were talking to Muhammad Ali because when I was a kid, I remember when he had gotten, um, when he had a fraught Michael Spinks, it was on television.

Speaker 4:          01:03:13       It was like a big deal. I remember my parents were trying to explain to me when I was a kid, like what had happened did, they'd kept him from fighting. Like my parents wanted to see him fight. Let my, I can't believe my parents were into fighting at all, but they'd want him to see Muhammad Ali beat Leon Spinks. Yeah, there's like some important fight and there, there are dealers at this guy was like a cultural hero. Cause what he had done was stepped up and said it, why would I shoot with a guy in Vietnam? No Vietnam man ever did anything to me. And he's right. And he was 100% right. And everybody knew it and it made sense. And because of that, they punished him and they wouldn't let him box for three years. Right. You know, they took away his livelihood in the prime of his career. Like physically.

Speaker 5:          01:03:54       Yeah. His, well, this, that, that phenomenon that you just described, it's been going on since the history of chocolate. I've top down power structures. I, this book I'm reading now, I can't run the name. It's so fucking good, but it's got, um, uh, you know, a picture of Copernicus standing before like Catholic hope's, um, and being judged for talking about the fact that the earth revolves around the sun. You know, it's like people say the truth throughout history and many people have gone to jail or going to burn it. The fucking state for it. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:04:31       Oh, that's true. I think the last time I drank this energy drink, it's pretty mellow, pretty mellow for an energy drink. It's like a lot of it is natural. It's like the 12 in it and shit. These guys sponsor, you know, it's just a friend of mine, Ryan White, powerful. I'm right. My friend Tom Atencio, he, uh, used to run affliction and he was the guy who put together the, or, or one of the guys who put together their mixed martial arts cards that they had. And I always appreciated that. But he did that and they, you know, affliction, support MMA. So I became friends with him and I was wearing their shirts for a little while, but then they fired him. So I quit. Out of respect for my friend, I avoided my, uh, my partnership with them. So, but so he sends me soda now.

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       He's cool. He's cool as fuck. He's a good dude. I just really respected what he and his company did for MMA. They really supportive a lot of fighters. They, they um, they supported a lot of, uh, of uh, fighters by promoting, um, they put on actual shows. They had I think three big shows, you know, and some of them were fucking great, great fights. They put together some wild fights, but they just found out it's way too expensive. People don't realize how much money the UFC spends behind the scenes, like how much it costs to keep the machine running. It's a, it's an amazing amount of work. There's so many people behind the scenes and they, all of them have a long history and the UFC has this big name, you know? It's hard to fuck with that. It's like to try to make a rival football league, even if you have a lot of talent. He kept van. Everybody knows what the NFL is, you know? They tried that shit a couple of times. They tried to, with the XFL member was like Vince Mcmahon, the wrestling guy and tried to do that. It's hard. It's hard to get people to, you know, and the UFC is consistent with the getting the best talent consistently

Speaker 5:          01:06:24       get the best talent. What's her name? Oh yeah. Ronda Rousey. The girl who walks around with a number. Oh area. You're like, hey, I got a perfect face. Perfect. Her face is just, she's a flawless face. It's like, wow, what's really funny about watching her? And she's gotten down this casual wave to the hordes of pervs. He wears screen. It's like an apocalypse now by the sea, a testosterone. She got this little side like two finger wave like God.

Speaker 4:          01:07:01       Do you remember that scene? That was a great fucking similar apocalypse now. That was, that seems so real. Totally real man. If you'd ever seen it, what happens is these guys were over there fighting. It war its own men. There's thousands of them. They fly in these playboy playmates and they were like dancing around on stage and it just gets angry. It's, it's just a, it becomes like a mosh pit of gorillas. I know. Eventually they have to

Speaker 5:          01:07:24       ended and fucking fly out of there. That was one of the best. I want to get left behind that scene. I don't remember. I should, I don't remember. Can I ask an important question? I think a lot of UFC fans wonder this every day and me included Eric, what's her name? Does she have a boyfriend? I do not know if she currently has a boyfriend. I do not know what we're dying to know because we all feel like everyone has a shot bombed on buy. I can't buy print it bombed down by the Rothchild. She gets bombed out. That people who like transforming to a rep telling in front of her here take a diamond.

Speaker 4:          01:08:07       She wouldn't do this, but if she wanted to she wouldn't. But if she wanted to, she's the type of check tick and get some like Middle East King, fly her out for like 1 million bucks. Easy. Yeah. Easy million bucks a night. Fuck him for 10 million. Yeah. I mean when you, when you have a choice, if you have 1 trillion bucks, like, well from what I understand is like royal families that have so much money and there it's not, they're not, the money's not public. Like when people look at like, who's like the richest man in the world? Oh, it's Bill Gates as it's probably not. It's actually probably some dude in the Middle East. It doesn't talk about it at all. And you don't know. Some prints are like, they have extraordinary amounts of money and I don't think that a lot of times it gets measured up in the same pile. I might be wrong about that, but from what people have told me about like, like real, real wealthy people in the Middle East, there's some of the wealthiest people on earth is that it's like insane, staggering amounts of wealth.

Speaker 5:          01:09:04       So fun. The thing I like to think about is like maybe you know like when you walk by a school and you see all the kids playing in the playground, some of them are fucking playing like four squares. Some of them are running around playing tag and they're just having a blast. Sometimes I think maybe that's what society is. Maybe you were just like kids playing around in this playground that's been created by really, really smart, super wealthy people and kind of watching watch maybe like maybe they have some fun with us. They like throw shit in there every once in a while just to play around. But there is so fucking powerful and rich. They're not, they don't need to go in there and like seem like they're famous or act like they're magical. They just like to watch. It's fun. Every once in a while they'll throw in something crazy. You know, every once in a while they'll throw in the aids virus or toss it.

Speaker 4:          01:09:52       Well, boom. Have power for no reason, which essentially everyone at the very top of the, the heat pads Po, there's no reason why you should have power. Okay? Now, if you have power for s for no reason, you know that it's not like you earned your power through your basketball skills. You know the fact that you shoot us a wicked three pointer or you are awesome at the violin. No, there's no real tangible skill that you present that anybody else couldn't also have. You know what I mean? What is vague characteristics like leadership and intelligence, the ability to speak well. God Damn, there's a lot of people that have bad shake. Yeah, there's, there's thousands of people out there in your neighborhood that can do that. Okay. So they know that you have to be treacherous in order to retain this power. When we see different laws every day that it'd been brought up, like the National Defense Authorization Act, all this on the different stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:10:42       All when you see like civil liberties giving you a road and you see corruption that he wrote, there's your evidence that that is the exact evidence that you need to know that the people better in a position of power shouldn't be empowered to trying to get more and more and more control. Why are you trying to get more and more control? Why are you actively trying to get control instead of dealing with the issues that we already have? Dealing with the crime that we already have dealing with, you know, are unsolved murders or what have you. Instead of devoting your time into that, into that aspect of helping society with law instead that you're trying to take away civil liberties, you trying to erode people's freedoms. That's the purest sign ever that the people who are in a position of power shouldn't be in a position of power. It's really sad. It's pure, it's pure. There's no arguing, there's no denying it. Obama can never deny it. If he brought it up to him, there's nothing he could say. There's no way anybody could save for your own good. When you did take away your ability to send a private email to somebody, we can't. You can't have that.

Speaker 5:          01:11:38       Well, what they say is they inevitably, one thing that they'll always say is it's complicated. It's a very complex system. You don't understand. There's a lot more to it than just legalizing marijuana. There's a lot more to it, Joe. It's always complicated. Vampires love complication. They love tangles and complexity and the opposite of simplicity simply because they, you know why? Cause they fucking hate the truth. And the truth is always simple. The truth is always just a very simple thing. It's a, you know, you jump off a cliff, you're going to die. It's, if you fucking don't eat, you're going to be hungry. There's just some, it's a tweet. The truth is a tweet. Yeah, fucking vampires. They will take a truth and they'll transform it and extrapolate so much shit from it that it turns into a fucking lie. And then let's say, you know, we can't, it's just too tangled up the world's economies just too confusing. This is why we've got to exploit these people. This is why we've got to throw farmers in jail. Cause it's complicated. This is why we're at war. We can't just not go to work. It's complicated. It's always complicated. But in the, in real life, it's not complicated. There's nothing fucking complicated about, uh, you probably shouldn't throw bombs. Places where there's kids that's like, if you see somebody throwing bombs in a place where there's some kids, you're gonna be like, you know, you probably shouldn't do that.

Speaker 5:          01:13:00       Fucking kills kids. But like, when it's no one knows what you don't understand. There's a target surgeons, surgeons can be in that. Oh, you mean fucking farmers who are sick of you driving tanks through their opium fields? Is that the insurgence you're talking about?

Speaker 4:          01:13:14       Are you seeing your original video from Wiki leaks? Right. The, the, the cash collateral murder video with the chose the, the helicopter shooting missiles and shit, and to a car that has kids in it. Oh yeah. You know, and someone says, this kid's well, it shouldn't have been taking the kids. What were they carrying guns. I mean, and whatever the fuck they said, you know, you shouldn't have any kids with you because if they should have thought about that since they're the enemy, they should, uh, meanwhile they were innocent. They, they shot a bunch of innocent people. It was, it was a complete total cluster. Fuck.

Speaker 5:          01:13:43       Sure. It's not complicated. It's a real simple thing about why, if that's the thing, here's the thing though, isn't it simple? There's some simple ideas. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:13:49       You're not supposed to shoot in the cars that have kids.

Speaker 5:          01:13:51       You're not supposed to shoot in the cars. I have kids in them. And also, uh, if you send out good energy into the world, you give good energy back. Here's another basic principle that you can test all day testing next week. Just,

Speaker 4:          01:14:03       well, they didn't even like zoom room to see if fair, if the people do have guns that they mean they, they just, they just Gundam down, man, I got to have that ability and that kind of power, you know? And they're like, I, you know, and they're saying, no, we were pretty sure this guy's got a gun and this guy's got a gun and they're like a permission to engage and they get permission. They just fucking open up on these people and that's it. Those people don't exist anymore and it's, it's, if we wouldn't even know that that is happening and we don't even know. Have you seen the new video, the Blackwater video that's been released recently, now the young Turks had about him? That guy sank. Um, I really liked that guy show. He's, he's, uh, he's fucking fearless man. He attacks everything. He attacks, uh, like, like he goes after that Peter Schiff guy, you know Peter Shift when he starts making excuses for Wall Street, you know, the way to fix this. And he's just like, no, you use it and calls him out. And he's like, you just want to keep extracting more money from the system. You just want to keep exceeding, know you're talking bullshit. And he cut him off. I liked it, man. It was interesting. But he was talking about this and he was, you know, he was talking about how, um, what was the fucking law?

Speaker 1:          01:15:13       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:15:14       What was the law that was passed? Which one?

Speaker 1:          01:15:19       Shit,

Speaker 4:          01:15:21       I'm completely lost my thought. What was his fucking thing about the young Turk? Yeah. I didn't see it. Shit. God dammit.

Speaker 4:          01:15:33       Well, I'll, I'll remember in a moment. Let's rewind a few steps back. All this macro shit, man. Thinking about the macro, the conspirator to drive me crazy if I don't remember what this fucking gods video was about. Oh, are Rakhi. Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, this is why it's so disturbing. I'm probably trying to forget it. It was watching the blackwater guys this young, the young Turks made a video about this and exposed it and showed there's, there's more videos had been released that were like from the actual cars of the guys in black water that we're driving around smashing into people's cars. One of them, they hit a lady while she was walking across the street and you see the guy, see the lady go down and go, oh shit. And they just drive on. It just left her there and they're smashed into people's cars.

Speaker 4:          01:16:17       They're sticking their guns out the window and just randomly shooting and things. It's right. It's really fucking crazy. It's really crazy to watch Matt. It's really crazy. And that's enough. That's just, there's just no getting around that you can't, you know, you were talking about like making the, that the Catholic religion or any kind of crazy cult that wants to have some sort of a justification for doing something wrong. You're fucking wrong. We'll read you some huge, huge volume tome on why it is that what they're doing is the correct move for everybody else in the long run. When you show a video like that, is that correct? Move using mercenaries, man. How could you see how crazy this is? You got people that are willing to kill people for money and you're paying them a fuck load of it and you're letting them just run a no man. I mean, this is a, this is a problem that will always exist as long as power structures are trying

Speaker 7:          01:17:10       EULAR instead of circular. And, um, and there's no way around that man. There's always just going to be that. There's no way around that. And the problem is when power structures are triangular, they don't, usually the people at the top of that fucking triangle, the pyramid, they don't, they won't listen to logic. They don't care about what's right or what's wrong. They're not going to listen to you. You have to take the power from the right. That's what the idea of the fucking right.

Speaker 4:          01:17:33       Well they have to die off too. That's the, that's how,

Speaker 7:          01:17:36       yeah, let's hope they die off because it's been a few thousand years and they don't seem to be going anywhere. It's just going to take different forms. They put on different masks and admittedly the violence is lessening and lessening. So maybe the violence will dissipate two to nothing. I just, I had no idea, man. I've been reading this fucking book about what the God named Catholics did. Did the fucking Cathars is what they were called Wikipedia. That thought has just got exterminated by the Catholic church is burn at the fucking state man for, for uh, believing a different version of Christianity. It could have been a threat.

Speaker 4:          01:18:10       Well, this is a long time ago obviously. It's just amazing that in 2012 after all the time and all the supposed to shit that we had learned from the dark ages and today even still you've got this video released, this blackwater video of people just going to a foreign land and just fucking people up. You know it's the, that is the, at the very, the very peak of our society when it comes to like causing change and damage and that is like the highest, most impactful part of our world is war, right? Most as far as like destruction and as far as like that's like society at its breaking point or its boiling point and it seems to stay at that same level. It seems to stay at that same level. We're, we're always just that close to fucking everything up. We're always that close and like as good as it ever got was like when Clinton was in office, didn't really seem like we're going to run anymore.

Speaker 4:          01:19:05       Seems like the Soviet Union kind of falling apart and we're the only big dog in town were pretty cool and we're not going to fuck with anybody money. So let's just, you know, it felt like everything was going to be okay. Yep. But then it went right back up to its boiling point and you realize that boiling point where we had with the Clinton way important, that was unusual. That was unusual. The lack of threat of imminent death. That's the unusual thing. This normal thing. And we've gone through with the Bush administration and we go through with the Obama administration now that's, that's unusual. That is rather the norm did the unusual thing is peace. The unusual thing is, is prosperity and relaxation and not worrying about fucking bombs dropping on overhead from the other side of the world. Well

Speaker 7:          01:19:45       it's, yeah, it's definitely normal one, the people who are making the laws and apparently then paid off by people that prosper from or it's totally normal then.

Speaker 4:          01:19:57       But it's amazing that it's, it's, it's still pushed through. It's amazing. It's amazing that in this day and age it can be so obvious. It can be so laid out and yet still gets pushed through. Here's what it's fucking amazing.

Speaker 7:          01:20:08       What's amazing is there's somebody in a corporation that has to have war happening or they're going to go bankrupt. That's what's amazing. There's people who like, man, we gotta get some wars do it. Or

Speaker 4:          01:20:20       our division is strictly missile reconstruction. We're not blowing up missiles and then we're not reconstruct the areas where missiles destroyed. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, exactly. Dude. That's what they're thinking when they, when they hear that piece might be coming. That's like, that's hearing that a fucking, uh, to go bankrupt. Do you think there's calls like, Hey, oh, I heard that y'all are running a surplus on a certain muscle that we're about to go into construction on it. We don't want to come out with version two while y'all still got version one going around and you think you can make some campaigns where you could put those bad boys to use.

Speaker 4:          01:20:59       Do you think that, uh, I was like a fucking Robert Downey jr contractor character could call somebody up and ask him to launch the missiles. You know? Do you think when that was the sons of bitches and manufacturer, that Shit Watch more footage on the news. They're like, Oh hell yeah, that's a bean. That's my boy. That's my, that's the child shredder. Hell yeah. Look at that thing. Look at a spread on that bomb. Hell yeah. Every time they see that they're like Ching, Ching, Cha Ching. Every time a bomb goes off they're like, yeah, that's a hundred grand. Hundred grand. Hundred grand. Yeah. What about dudes that are like never been to war, but they're like obsessed with like soldier Fortune magazine or on protection fucking, you know, packing heat ever where they go. Yeah. They live in the wild west in the back of their head. Dude, I gotta tell you man, I think I got the potential to be like that would be his man. Cause like I, yeah, cause I like it's an equalizer. That's why people like it. If you, if you feel like you've been put in a situation where you could have been in danger physically because some asshole wanted to fuck you up and they could have done that to you, you know, that's a terrible, terrible feeling. So once you've experienced that terrible feeling, you only have some sort of an equal,

Speaker 7:          01:22:06       nothing wrong with it, man. I really, I mean it seems so weird cause I know I come off as this kind of like hippie dude, but I was raised in the South Man and my dad taught me to how to be safe with a gun. Taught me off on it was the shoot a gun taught me like, you know, it took me hunting and like I'm not afraid of guns. I think they're fucking awesome man. They're really cool. I just don't, I, I haven't gotten around to buying one, um, in La and not if it feels like there's this, you know, we were talking about this around Diaz and he was saying like, it'll attract guns. Like it's a lot of people think that they think that if you have the weapon, it will act as some kind of magnet for negativity that will like bring, bring it to you. It's a superstitious idea, but some part of me, oh my gosh, it may be so a man. Right? I don't know. Maybe I should just ignore it and I have a gun because I mean, I, I, I can't, I doubt anyone's, well, you never know, man. You never know. Somebody could just decide to fucking kicking your door in, like take your shit and fucking stab you to death.

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       People do get robbed. There are home invasions. People do scope people out. It doesn't happen. Doesn't happen that often. Well, the, what's really going on, man, is it, there's so many fucking people on this planet. You're hearing about so many different violent acts. Even in bad neighborhoods, violent acts are fairly rare. No. Well, it might be a million people in one of them gets shot a day. It sucks. You wanted a million. Not a lot. I mean, it's not, it's not a little, you know, when you think about it that way,

Speaker 7:          01:23:32       sexy, this is the society we live in, man. This is where we've hit upon in the multiverse. Cause like he got all the other things that people can break into your house and do like what a great dimension where like fucking hot chick sometimes swarm neighborhoods and just give random blood. Right?

Speaker 4:          01:23:45       Well what if you don't want a random blowjob from a hot check? What have you trying to like control your sperm and you're on this Dalai Lama type journey and some hot chick breaks into his house and sucks his dick and ruins this whole spiritual journey.

Speaker 7:          01:23:57       Yeah. What if you turn into a Zombie? Like anyone's not going to want a blow job from a high.

Speaker 4:          01:24:00       He's going to realize that he wasted his whole stupid life dressing up like a genie when he could have been just getting his dick sucked from the get go. The lesson yet is a good lesson. But you can't force someone to have a lesson. Well, you can't rape the Dalai Lama. I mean, that's what she'd be doing. She'd be waving the poor guy. He couldn't help himself testing that hot chicks going rape the dollar. Why am I want a woman that hot stove stroking your cost. You are not even in control. You're not even in control it. You're a Zombie. You what you are in Dna Zombie. You just trying to shoot DNA brains. You're just trying to shoot loads loads. Just trying to get rid of that. That ache in your balls. Oh, what a terrible Dalai Lama. The whole guys like means he's a single sort of pudgy man, kind of Asian character, has a lot of really famous friends.

Speaker 4:          01:24:47       You know it's kind of a name dropper. Always hanging out with Richard. I'm not dissing him at all. I'm just being honest about is what it looks like. It'd be awesome if you would that would rock is fucking world. If some Megan Fox looking chick came in and started talking to his cock, that'd be awesome. Is that the Dalai Lama fire back at you? Well, you got mad at me. I don't want, I don't mean any disrespect to the dawn wall. No, fuck you Joe Rogan. Oh would be crazy if I was the first cattle Dalai Lama told to go fuck himself. Like wow, I must be a deck. I'm sure he's a great guy and I don't think there's anything wrong with doing life the way he's doing. I just think it's when I, when I look at his life in comparison to a wife that I would find interesting, I'm like, come on man.

Speaker 4:          01:25:25       No, no, you don't want to have a wife or a girlfriend. You don't want to have sex. You don't want to like willing, don't want to engage in like fun things and really is that too much? It's too much of an effort to, is that, is it really too much of an effort to have a relationship or can you, can it be managed and you're just a lazy bitch and you can't figure out how to manage your own life and manage your own relationships in a way that you would attract someone who would also have sort of a harmonious relationship with you. You know, for some people that's like too much work to try to get their own shit together to attract someone. So I mean it's like a, just a real complicated formula so to say, oh that's too much work. I think you miss out on big part of what it is to be a human being. He obviously has compassionate relationships with people where he's friends with them and he communicates with them. But to not be exchanging affection, in my opinion, is just this massive misunderstanding of, of the the joy of life. Because sex with someone you love, that you're really attracted to you is one of them that you really attracted to. It's one of the most intense physical experiences and beautiful experiences a person can ever have. It really is. It's an intense, it's, it's a beautiful intense experience that cannot be recreated in a solo environment.

Speaker 7:          01:26:36       Well this is that. This is the thing I like. It's these are things that are impossible to answer because that you could, I only read about them. I don't know if it's true or not, but like I think a lot of people who become hermits and leave society of those people, of all the people who leave society and become a monk, go and become a hermit, go into the woods and vantage from life, all those people, probably a big percentage of them are doing it as an escape mechanism. Right, right, right, right. But I bet there's a small percentage and then the that are like have heard of these peaks that you can climb too and consciousness that the certain things will get in the way of getting to those peaks. It's not impossible, but certainly it's kind of like no, you know, there's a lot of different paths to do.

Speaker 7:          01:27:20       The florist, some of them are more difficult than others and some of them are, especially when you've got the complication of the wife and children, you can't, you can't go through some of the, uh, forms of discipline that apparently are required to hit a transcendent experience that a lot of people, many, many, many, many people have written about. You know what I mean? So I think there is a small group of people who really authentically, you're just like, I don't want to fucking go for it. I want to see how far I can go and do this is their enlightenment, is there this state of higher awareness that you can get through meditation? I want to do that and that, you know, the prescription for some of these things is the fucking meditate for years straight. Yeah. You know, you can't do that with fucking kids. You can't do that with a, you can't do that with a job. You can't do it with the normal complications as society. So you got to go out into the, out under the fucking cave to do it.

Speaker 4:          01:28:16       Just amazing. When you really stop and think about it, it's like no other or rather it's like any other discipline, you know, in order to really take it to the highest level. Yeah. You have to devote all of your time to it. That's it. And managing the mind in managing the, the deep recesses of your consciousness and increasing the brain's ability to focus on certain tasks and things. And then they've shown that that meditation directly changes the way the brain works. Do you know it's the, the, the, the, the, the rose. Um, uh, what would it would, it would, vision isn't with, they use when they're doing like cross sections of the brain during any sort of a neural activity, cat scans, I don't know if it's a cat scan or whatever it is. They run tests on people and they find out like what areas of the brain are. Secondly, they have

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       remarkable minds. You know, people that meditate like Buddhist monks, it's like they've literally developed a different sort of things

Speaker 3:          01:29:09       brain dude, it's, I don't think my brain is changed, but my, one of my favorite parts of the day, I wake up in the morning and chant, I fucking love it dude. And I'll tell you, I'll wake up with my brain's squirming with shit thoughts and like anxious sometimes and just maybe I had a bad dream or like I'm stressed out about something, right? I sit down and fucking meditate. 10 minutes, 15 minutes later, it's not gone. Yeah, I'm not healed. I'm not cured if the thoughts, but now the thoughts aren't on top there underneath my will. Right. You know what I mean? And that changes everything for the rest of the day because now when I'm attacking the different problems and things I have to accomplish, the first thing I'm feeling is this sense of self control and underneath it are all the anxieties instead of approaching your problems with an anxious mind or a turbulent mine.

Speaker 2:          01:29:56       I think managing the mind and putting the mind to good use, it's just like managing the body and putting the body to good use. And I think the mind can become more athletic. The mind can become more synaptic or more responsive rather synaptic weight. Well the, it's uh, yeah, the mind is definitely, I'm sure. I mean look, when you write, when you write, don't you notice that if you like take time off and write again, you start writing and you'll feel a little clunky at first and then after a day or two and the groove and then, yeah. And then you get to that, it's like you have to like keep up that sort of shape. You have to keep up a certain creative shape or you know, or a mine, uh, you know, a meditative, sort of a controlled shape. This is what people, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:30:39       Um, this is the product. This is why more people don't meditate and more people fucking boring. It's boring at first. It's boring at first, but when, but after you

Speaker 2:          01:30:49       lose your mind after you lose your mind, after you fucking get past

Speaker 3:          01:30:53       the initial thing, the initial, like boredom of it, it turns into something really incredible. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:30:58       But he's the deepest you've ever gotten

Speaker 3:          01:30:59       through meditation. Yeah. Man, the deepest I ever got through meditation was I was super stoned.

Speaker 2:          01:31:08       That does not count. Oh, it's the wound is here. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:31:19       Most certainly you can get stolen shit, man. Yeah. You get you. It's one of my favorite things to do as it get stoned and meditate. Fuck, that's the best man. We kinda had this funny story about, or this funny analogy about Ufo abductees is that the real problem with any stories about that you ever hear about Ufo is, is that you have to automatically discount every one of them that involve five grams of mushrooms. Well, it's true too, right? Because you, oh, you were tripping dude, but made me, that's no, but maybe that's how he sees it. Yeah. Well no, fuck

Speaker 3:          01:31:53       or maybe like a lot, a lot of different philosophies came from people getting really high. That's that book I showed you. You know that cannabis is, has, it is a very old plant that we've had a relationship with for a long time and people love doing validate things that you thought of when you were stoned. They lost and validate states of consciousness you attain through merging with a plant mother. But I'll tell you, man, fucking getting hot chanting and, and uh, getting high. Wow. That's like now if you want me to like come up with a time when I, when I wasn't stoned in meditating. I do think of a time when I was on the zen retreats sitting and staring at a wall and for like seven hours straight. And like definitely there was a shift in consciousness and I was like getting, getting confused.

Speaker 3:          01:32:42       I take, I take offense to that. I really do. I was getting confused because I've been staring at a wall for so long. I was getting confused about my identity, which was sort of a consciousness. Yeah. It was a bit of a poisoning, but she like, well, I was staring at the wall and I knew I was, I mean, we're talking like eight hours and fucking meditating. Malik's yeah. With your eyes open, like you're just kind of going in and out of like, no, you technically you're not supposed to be. This is why in the Zen temples in Japan where the people really take it seriously, people walk around with fucking rods and the moment amongst starts nodding off. They get a nice fucking rod and the right on their shoulder, you can whack, wake your ass up. Wow. So like, um, and that's no, they want you there in the moment and you're trying to accomplish, well, super, she mentioned the only way to become like a real warrior.

Speaker 3:          01:33:49       It could become a psychic warrior. Well, this is the fucking crazy thing man. I mean with, with what's a zen monk trying to accomplish the answer to that? Nothing. It's like a but, but um, yeah, but other people who don't have such lofty ideals to merge with the nothing is uh, these people are trying to accomplish things. And I believe the name of these super powers or magical traits that you get from disciplining the will are called cities as I d, d, h. I. S. Yeah. And these are like, these are like the ability, if you, if you, if you start focusing, you know, I would even say that in some weird way, stand up comedy is a form of city in the sense that you're able to get in front of a group of people and make them fucking laugh. Uh, and it takes a long time to develop.

Speaker 3:          01:34:35       It's a discipline that takes a long time to develop. And you get this skill, it's kind of abnormal that some people aren't able to do. You know what I mean? Like it doesn't have to be reading someone's mind. It doesn't have to be levitating or walking through a wall. It's just like, shit man. When I watch the fucking UFC and see somebody do it, flying leg kick and to someone's head, that's magic. To me, that's a magical fucking thing. That guy, the fact that that guy can do that, it's acrobatic or when they're these fucking asshole, not they're not really assholes, but when you see him getting our backflip content, these guys throw a fucking back flip like it's nothing. We're fighting for three rounds and handed the backflip doesn't land and you fall. That's going to be played on the internet or at least get involved in that back flip.

Speaker 3:          01:35:21       It's super extreme man. So to me that's also a four. It's not real magic in this instance. Explain, explain, explain it. But it's like I think that people have can develop other forms of this and the other forms of it. I don't want to use the term telepathy, but maybe people get really good at reading micro gestures or micro movements in someone's face and recognizing when they're telling the truth or when they're telling a lot, fuck man. Just someone who's really focused and sitting and listening to you and looking you in the eye and a really focused way that's a nerving. Sometimes when someone's got real fucking focus, cause most people don't. Most people are scattered. They're scattered to the fucking wins. Man. Barely listened to you for four minutes without fading out or checking their phone or fucking, you know what I mean? So we'll itself just the ability to draw your senses and in focus in the moment, that's a pretty potent thing to be able to to do.

Speaker 3:          01:36:17       And you're not going to get that from playing video games. You're going to get that from getting drunk all the time. You're not going to get that from fucking all the time. You're going to get that from stopping the show, sitting down, crossing your legs, taking a breath and not moving for 10 minutes and watch your mind freak the fuck out. Your mind will turn into a cat. You're trying to put in the bathtub. Your mind will just start wriggling squirming, warming. Hey, what are you doing? That's almost the first thing he's thinking like, come on. What are you fucking doing here? What are you sitting here not moving forward? What is this or you think you are? Thank you fucking Gandhi. What do you think you're doing? Really? You're gonna do this. And then that. If you overcome that, then that'll change a little bit and all of a sudden you'll start relaxing a little bit.

Speaker 3:          01:36:59       Your body relax and all of a sudden it's like, Oh shit man, I haven't put that fucking candle out in the other room. I should go put that candle on the other and I think I left a candle burning in the other room. And then you just breathe through that and then it's going to be, oh fuck. I called Jack, I forgot to call Jack. It's all these, these moments trying to take you away. It's almost like your mind is set all these infinite traps to keep you from getting in the state of stillness, but eventually the more you do that, the more your mind will begin to be in the moment and not be in a place of expectation and not be waiting for the meditation doing and not be thinking about how cool it is that you're meditating or out dominoes that you're meditating. Something else kicks in that thing, that fucking thing, man. That's the thing that I think people are trying to extend through their entire lifetime. It's just that state of being present in the moment with no goal for what's going to happen, not caring about what happened. You know? I, it's just a difficult place to get to. You don't always want to be there either. You don't want to be there

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       all day because you have to live with humans and if you're going to live completely in that total zen state, I guess he could do it. Ron doss style and just go video conferencing with people all day online. But if you want to actually try and make a living,

Speaker 3:          01:38:07       no, the ROM dot. Stout is really interesting because there Ron Bass style doesn't have ethics attached to it. Man, that guy fucking talks about going and eating, like going into a fucking restaurant and ordering a steak. Yeah. Fuck yeah. Steak he did in this story. I don't know if he continues to eat me, but it's like his whole thing is like, listen man, it's not worth what we're, well, what we're going for here isn't fake. A fake way of fake and position. What we're going here, it for us or going for is this being in the flow of life, being in the moment, wedding it. Sometimes I'm in total fucking cheeseburgers. Times eat that Burger. Sometimes it needs fucking, you know, uh, get your cock sucked sometimes. You know what I mean? Sometimes it means,

Speaker 2:          01:38:48       well, you said that was so southern and your docs up North Carolina and my sister's room,

Speaker 3:          01:38:56       I love my southern accent does come out sometimes, but yeah, man, it, this is this, this state of being in the moment doesn't mean, right,

Speaker 2:          01:39:04       right. But don't you have some sort of an ethical responsibility for animal cruelty and the pollution of the environment and all the different variables that really, even though you have no control over, you are a part of society and yeah, the macro contribute to the problem by continuing support.

Speaker 3:          01:39:19       This is what I think about that. I call this the what you're saying. I consider it the starving kid in Africa. The starving kids in Africa has stopped many, many people from experimenting with like bringing their will end the world because they think, yeah. What about the fucking starving kid in Africa? What about the, what about the macro? What about the eating meat hurts animals and um, the big, the bigger picture where I think that that is a very valid thing to think about. But I think the first thing to think about before you start thinking about the bigger picture is your little picture, right? It's thinking about how are you treating the people around you? How, what living condition or un, how are you healthy? Are you exercising first? Deal with that. Deal with that and then worry about the fucking kid in Africa first deal with that thing and you'll get your, you know, your, your, uh, get your focus back.

Speaker 3:          01:40:09       Come out of autopilot first because your ego will tell you like, look man, we've got to think about the big picture. The Ego always wants to think about the big fucking picture. Do you go? Holly's wants to think about like, if the ego is a messianic, the ego wants to be Jesus. The Ego wants to heal the world, or the ego wants to fucking do all this crazy shit. Meanwhile, you're fucking smoking cigarettes. Your apartment smells like cat litter. Your falls are fucking festering with crab lice. You know what I mean? You got to fucking think about the fucking money. You got to think about the moment.

Speaker 2:          01:40:41       Yeah. We were talking about a dude who was screaming, yelling about chem trails while I was smoking cigarettes. Yeah. It's like what you're doing, how's gotta be worse than what they're doing by spraying you?

Speaker 3:          01:40:51       Absolutely, man. That that's you. This is the beside. This I think is the recipe for a true revolution. The recipe for a true evolution does not involve going out into the world trying to attack these ancient, powerful monolithic structures by throwing Molotov cocktails at them. It fucking involves stopping looking at the way your treating the people directly around you. How do you treat waiters? How do you treat people at the, at the cash register? How do you treat people that you have power over? Even if the power's illusionary and it's just a game cause when you're with a waiter, you're playing the game of someone being served. They're playing the game of the sir. You're just fucking people, but you start looking, how am I treating the people around? At first you start looking at how am I treating myself? That's number one. Number one, look at yourself.

Speaker 3:          01:41:39       Are you being authentic to yourself? Are you being sweet to yourself? Are you taking vitamins or you being cruel to yourself? Are you poisoning yourself? Are you shoving poison into your body's first bodies body first deal with that. Then once you start feeling good and healthy again, the depression will start wearing off. And then you start looking at the way you're treating people around you. Then you start tipping too much. This is something you've taught me, man. I don't want to go all fucking secret on everybody's ass here. But ever since I started tipping too much fucking more money than I've ever made, it's been coming into my life, dude. And I feel like there's some kind of like direct, uh, correlation between how much you put out and how much comes back. It's possible. It's also possible that just came in a coincidental time doing.

Speaker 3:          01:42:24       You started making money and could tip because had some momentum running. Dude, I'll tell you, I'll tell you one number one customer. I'll tell you one quality that is, I always have when I'm broke. You know what that fucking quality is selfishness. I always will look at the way I'm acting. It's always very fucking selfish. It's always survival mode and I got to look out for me. You know what I mean? This is, there's a fucking verse and I always quote the fucking Bible. I'm not a Christian, but there's a verse in the New Testament that I'd always perplexed me. It was something like those who have will get more and those who have not more will be taken away. And the idea is like this sense of like this, it doesn't make sense. It doesn't go with the way we've been taught. It doesn't make sense that if you give out more than you have, you'll get more back.

Speaker 3:          01:43:11       It doesn't say you just have to be generous, give more than you have, more than you have to give more than you can trust with my children. If you just say I'm going to try a hundred percent and 10%. I know, I know. You're right. No, you know what it is, man. It's like the, the church, uh, had this idea and the idea was typing, right? And the idea was give 10% of your income to the church. Right. This is so because the church Churchill deal with like giving the money out. Now I think that this is based on a metaphysical principle. I think it's based on a metaphysical principle, which is that, uh, if you give out, like imagine, I think we may have talked about this before, but imagine if you cut out 10% of your income and, and just put it in a pile and made the decision that that 10% you're going to just fucking give to people in need it, you're just going to give it to help people.

Speaker 3:          01:44:08       You're going to use it to like help people. That's 10% of your income is going out into the world to help people. That would be your favorite money. That fucking 10% like on a Saturday. If you get to go into that account and be like, fuck man, I'm going to buy my friend Xbox just because, because that's coming out of the 10% that's a cool thing. That's a good idea, man. Everybody thinks it's like, oh, I'm going to go give a ham sandwich to a heroin addict. No, go fucking surprise your friends. Take them out to fucking take him out to dinner and then fucking buy dinner when they didn't expect it. Take one of your friends, right. It doesn't have a lot of money right now and do something really cool for them when they don't expect it and don't act like they, oh, you do swag now. I do it. I just thought it'd be fun. That's fun. That's tightening. If you ask me instead of letting the church be in control of it. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:44:52       Well the problem with the, the church is always going to be like, who are they? Let's, this is people, man, they're not really representing God, so he got a good church. You can work out well, could they? You know, there's a lot of churches that do a lot of great stuff for the community. There's a lot of churches that keep people together. There's a lot of people out there, dude, they didn't haven't thought too much about the world. They haven't thought too much about the complexities of the various different things that we do understand about the world. Subatomic particles interacting with each other across the university. The exact same time trek communication through subatomic particles, particles that are in both a super position when they're in a state of both standing and moving at the same time. Is this too much craziness going on in the world and there's not enough curiosity and that combination of that and their culture and whatever the fuck their genetic imprint was, whatever, you know, whatever nine volt battery that they were born with, all of that combined.

Speaker 4:          01:45:46       Some people need religion, man. Some people, it's like a super beneficial tool. I don't, I don't deny it. Look at the, essentially what Christianity is supposed to be. It's supposed to be someone about being positive, about representing God, being booed, living life by God's standards. Well, if you look at what God's standards are sort of vaguely and you'd take out of this story is about killing people and he tells you to kill. And what happens if you're a gay dude and Jesus doesn't say any of that, but it's in the Bible. It's supposed to be the, if the Bible is supposed to represent the word of God, if it is reeling, well this is the shit.

Speaker 3:          01:46:20       Talk to the fucking loon land disciples saying right, you can't just throw up cry. Sandy got that whole sweet old book.

Speaker 4:          01:46:30       Ultimately when it comes down to a Chirsto really depends on who's running the church. Like the church could be a great asset to a community and a good place where people learn to be good people or it could be fucking craziness. If you wind up in a church where you know the priests are fucking kids and the whole thing is chaos,

Speaker 3:          01:46:47       I'll tell you, you know what, I got a lot info from man. I got a big download from when I used to go to a ga paid church with Reverend Michael Beckwith. I would fucking go there and that guy would last positivity. You would go there and get, you would walk out of there feeling so fucking great.

Speaker 4:          01:47:03       What is a, his denomination?

Speaker 3:          01:47:05       Uh, he, I don't know the name of the and denomination, but like he there end into this book called the science of mind by Ernest Holmes, which is like this idea that you create your own reality by the thoughts that you think. And I know it's a, it's just uh, it's that mixed in with all the world religions make stand with like kind of like, I mean, listen man, it's a big church and I'm not saying every moment of the ceremony wasn't slightly embarrassing and I'm not saying they're not people, they're dressed in like baggy big baggy pants and wearing sandals and have really gone deep into fruit land. I'm not saying that that didn't happen, but that church man, some of the information I got out of there, it was fucking really high tech information. I'll tell you something else that happened to me there and I'm sure I'm going to get fucking made fun of for this, but I'll tell you, man, I had a fucking terrible, I'd throw my back out, throw my fucking back out and couldn't move my fucking neck and I was like fucked up. And in a lot of pain and I'm standing there, oh my God, there was a song you sing. Never seen this song and this fucking guy behind me

Speaker 4:          01:48:11       retard giving you a back rub and grabbing your shaft. I know there's a story before you attack the fucking you gotta let me finish it early in the me. Here's the reason I knew this was coming. I know. Sorry, I fucking

Speaker 3:          01:48:31       this guy. I think it's funny if this guy touches my back and dude, instantly I felt fucking better. Instantly. Everything went away. My back felt better. Everything

Speaker 4:          01:48:41       you gentlemen remember what I said yesterday about disinformation agents? Dunkin, clearly we just expose himself as a government agent agent if disinfection. He says all this brilliant shit and then he incorporates some vacuum magic touches because motherfuckers doing Christian heels

Speaker 3:          01:48:59       only report from my own experience.

Speaker 4:          01:49:02       What about praying the gay away? Have you ever seen anybody successfully pray the gay away

Speaker 3:          01:49:07       now? Have you ever seen someone try? No. No. Okay. I haven't seen anyone fucking pray.

Speaker 4:          01:49:15       Hey Lane, but it's not the same thing. It's all the same thing as a guy coming up and touching you and hearing your back didn't come up with some magical touch. He'll get back. Silly Bitch, why didn't you give me this? I can't. I can't tell. Leave this alone. This is ridiculous. So some guy came up and like that'd be his desire to stick his penis inside. Your asshole was so strong, but as he touched your back to jolt, just realign your back because your back knew that it had to fight to survive

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       because they're all felt the love and lust of this man's fingertips. Sterile. You'll me Dale have flannel underwear on. He wasn't wearing underwear that, whoa, look, I bill I, I'm s rock Cockins zipper. I'm dangerous. Right? Pressed up against the cold metal resemble. Yeah. I believe that your attorney healers and always let me just touch his back. The gay came out of his hand like a lightening bolt and was like one of the Avengers. The gay came out of his hand, India back and it just popped your back into order. Hey listen, this is exactly what Jesus said was like a baby. I'm being persecuted. I you, you know what you, and this is religious persecution and yes, it is. Absolutely. Absolutely. Like I prayed it, he, he got out, he couldn't help himself. You were sexy, was slightly slumped leaning to one side liquid, get a hurt knee, navy. Trying to remember the, perhaps even limping, trying to remember the song that we sang there just so I get your anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:50:59       I think I did. I'm going to give you more. Okay. More fucking ammo. Okay. La, go read God's power. Something my life. I can't wait.

Speaker 2:          01:51:13       And they would just sing this over and over again and everybody was really getting into it.

Speaker 3:          01:51:17       People would like go up and down the aisles with Kleenex because people would start crying and like it was like, but you know the, I've learned to not throw the baby out with the bath water. Uh, and so like a lot of the stuff, yeah. I don't know if I necessarily was like, you know, fully on board, but I got some good information from there, man. There was like some really, uh, the shit that he talked about was this concept of being able to like at your, you decide when it's time to, to be happy. You decided to not be a victim. You decided to pull yourself out of the negative Meyer that you're in and you can just do it. You don't have to come up with excuses. You don't have to go to the fucking mountains and meditate forever. You don't have to, you can just stop being a victim. Right, right. And the moment you do that, your life will become a million times better and everything else will follow from there. You know, you'll start treating people around you better. And when you start treating people around you better, you're going to get more prosperity because if you're treating people around you like, Shit, yeah, you're cutting off all these currents and circuits that

Speaker 2:          01:52:22       well, you, any interaction that you have with someone that ends up in a negative and negative on their side or a negative on your side, you know, it's going to leave you with like a little bit of a deficit for sure. You know, it's not a good feeling. So a good feeling when someone's upset at, you know, it sucks, sucks fucking sucks. And you don't realize how much of an impact your, your words or your actions can really have until you see them someone, and then you realize then it's all manifest itself to you. It all shows and you're like, God damn it. What the fuck was I thinking? I just got so flippant. Yeah. You know, being rude or being aggressive or being adamant or argumentative or whatever it is that causes these blips in the matrix. But sometimes you need to have those in your life. Just as a reminder, you know me, careful, you know, not even saying that you should have to have them, but you look, I, I've seen, I seen him in other people and I learned, well, it's

Speaker 3:          01:53:13       ping pong, man. You can get caught up in a long game and shit. Ping Pong young people and it's like, look, there's no way that you're going to, there's no way that you're going to be perfect and there's no way you're going to avoid conflict and there's no way you're going to avoid getting angry. But the main thing is, man, here's the main thing, forgiveness and forgiveness. If fucking isn't always fair. That's the thing about forgiveness, dude. It's not always fair. You're not out. He, it's not always about who wins or who loses or who's right or who's wrong. Sometimes you just have to be like, look man, we got fucking blasted out of a pussy or plunging towards oblivion. We're in this insane fucking dimension. You freaked out for a second. I freaked out. I forgive you. You win if you, you know what I mean? Like you just take that extra step and you know what that does? That stops the fucking, uh, what, when you see like that stops the, the negative energy ball. That's the idea,

Speaker 2:          01:54:14       right? Um, are you talking about anyone in specific?

Speaker 3:          01:54:18       Yeah. Yeah. You know, I, I already,

Speaker 2:          01:54:23       I know you already did with for people to know Brian and Duncan had gotten into an argument and uh, you know, it was unfortunate. It's unfortunate on both sides as unfortunate that Dunkin brought it up in a public setting and sort of blind side. And I'm going to think you feel that, right?

Speaker 3:          01:54:42       I set it on that last pass. Yeah. Did I did the real, here's the real thing I learned from it though, man. This is the thing, you, you're not going to avoid conflict. And in a community, that's one thing I learned is we have this little fucking commodity.

Speaker 2:          01:54:55       Do you, if you had a chance to do it all again, you wouldn't have done it that way. Absolutely not. Yeah. I'm going to be honest with you. And Maura was snippy that day anyway, my name even got snippy with me when I was fucking with you and I was not being not aggressive, but you, you seem like you a bit testy that day.

Speaker 3:          01:55:10       Yeah, man. I was texting you that day and, and what happened was, um, without going into, I hate fucking resurrecting it again because I think that it's like, um, what made you test you that day? I don't want to talk about that man.

Speaker 2:          01:55:24       Okay. And that's a personal issue. It's a fucking personal issue. You certainly have, there's a family issue or a bit imbalanced.

Speaker 3:          01:55:32       Yeah. But anyway, there's no excuse. I don't fucking know why was I testing, always test me cause I was not in control of my fucking self. That's when anyone's testing, there's no excuse. Right. People always come up with excuses for acting like a fucking asshole. Right. It all boils down to like

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       you handling your own shit. Yeah. Not imposing your own bullshit on. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:55:48       exactly. Do it. But, so the what, what happened is, um, so what happened is during a podcast and Atlanta with Marshall Child's the laughing skull, I was starting to talk about, uh, it was videos I made for south by southwest because I was trying to lead in to talking about the Moontower comedy festival.

Speaker 2:          01:56:08       Well when people don't know, Dunkin has been pretty adamant about the, uh, in my opinion, the very correct idea that if you're going to have a festival when you profit off of it and you have comedians perform at your festival, at the very least you have to fly down there. I mean if you want them to work for free, you can't really expect them to fly themselves. And then when you find out the whole thing was sponsored by an airline, you're like, what? Right. Cause they are going to profit by the fact that people have to fly in. Like the whole thing is crazy. So you, you wrote this, you made this video where it was Hitler and then over Hitler's screaming you had the handle translation. The Hitler meme. Yes. The translation was saying, you know how preposterous it is, right.

Speaker 3:          01:56:52       It was just the basic idea. What you said, if you charge for a, if you have an event centered around Comedians, artists, whatever, that couldn't function without the comedians or artists, you have to fairly compensate them. You have to pay them, pay them a percentage of the door. It doesn't have to be a lack, give them a little cut, whether it's a flight hotel, I don't know. Whatever the fuck it is. Right. Just like make it fair. So I was starting to talk about that and then Brian got on the microphone and started talking about how no, no, no, they pay the performers. Whereas like I have, you know, I said it was up to the venues. Well No, no he, he, what he was talking about was as a comedian, you can get sponsorship from other people like Brown paper tickets or other, like corporations will pay for you to perform at their parties or will in some way fund you. But the festival itself doesn't pay.

Speaker 2:          01:57:44       So some venues don't pay. The artists know. Some venues don't decide that because they're at a certain place in your paid. Cause. I've heard that some people have gotten paid by south by southwest who's getting paid.

Speaker 3:          01:57:55       I have, um, I actually think the Guy Charlie said tello who runs south by southwest. When I was at Moontower, we had the same fucking conversation. Right. And you know, like you, he was, he was saying, you know, we don't, we don't fucking pay job. We didn't pay Johnny Cash. Whoa. You know what I mean? Like we don't pay. Yeah, I know. Watch, you know, like gangster, he was saying, yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:58:17       yeah. Johnny Cash to work for you for free. Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:58:19       sir. All right. So that's the point. I already had this conversation with this guy right about this. So I, at least from the perspective of the representative of south by southwest in the comedy side, it told me directly this happened. And then also as a, as an, uh, um, as a, uh, uh, other note, he said, you know, we, we do give a hundred bucks. Well, we don't even talk about it. So they pay comics 100 bucks. That's what I found out. That we don't talk about it. Yeah. That's what he said. He said, this is not going to, I didn't bring up Charlie's to tell them, by the way, when there's a big secret, we were given a comic, a hundred bucks. Yeah. Whatever. It's still so the, so, um, and Charlotte to tell it seemed like a really nice guy and I kind of respect him for coming up to me and talking to me about it.

Speaker 3:          01:59:03       I still completely disagree with him, but he came up and he talks because he heard your video. Yeah. He's the one who does the comics or south by southwest. So like, it was really cool. He wasn't angry. He just came up to me and broke it down in his own way from his own paradigm about fucking work. So anyway, justification for not paying. You get a lot out of the festival as a performer. It's, it's, there's two paradigms. The paradigms are, the two paradigms are, uh, people who pay based on a percentage from the door or some other form of like money compensation and people who feel like they're offering a venue and they're offering the benefits that you get from performing on a show, whether it's working out or HR were amazing. The idea that, you know, you could have a festival of art and the a profitable festival art and say that the festival is more important that the art that's represented there.

Speaker 3:          01:59:55       So the festival should profit. But the artists are getting the luxury of performing pimp gangster festival and a lot of it's really amazing. I like to play my own devil's advocate. South by southwest is an expensive festival and a lot of people like seeing bands and some comics like seeing bands and we're going to go to south by southwest anyway, so now they don't have to pay the 700 bucks that you have paid. They see everything. So there's that. There's the justification of that perspective. I've never been, but regardless I feel, when is it? I don't know. You know, we should do, we should just book the Cap City if it's not already booked probably. I bet it's already booked a, but it's like something like Doug Benson or someone tries to get like even Vance, I'd be really fun cause it doesn't Doug do all that shit.

Speaker 3:          02:00:44       He goes to all those places. I don't know. Yeah, he's always, he's a wild bachelor character. He's out there slinging Dick around the country for 20 in the afternoon on Saturdays. He's doing what he wants now, man. It's really fascinating. You know he's got, Doug's got, this is this thing where he can show up at like a regular club, like it has a full weekend and he comes on at four 20 in the afternoon and he does these for 20 shows where it's all his fans. What about side Boob? Sunday. How'd that guy manufacturer that where it gets checks to send pictures of their side tit. Who's this? Who are you talking about? Doug Benson does that. It's the best side boob. Sunday. People tweet, beautiful hippie chicks tweet. They're like the profile. That's beautiful. Some, it's really funny how you look on Twitter and some a porn girls have like pick of the, and you

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       click on it, it's done with a giant Dick in their mouth and one their ass and you're like, whoa. Really? Just picking the day. That's it. No fucking morning at all. Like you got to go, okay, well now I know how she's walking in. There's some girls don't ever have that in their Twitter. Some, some strippers might as well be accountants. They might as well be working for Denny's, you know, they just have like, you know, here's today, this is what I did. I built Dah, Dah, Dah. But some, uh, some of those, uh, porn girls have, they'll just throw up some wild pictures. You've gotta be NSFW gotta be careful that when people get mad for probably, well, does that work thing? That's what we were talking about earlier. Well, I mean it was sort of, I mean, we didn't even really dove into it.

Speaker 2:          02:02:27       What happened was Lou and this elevated snippy state, I'll just cut to the chase. You called Brian out for something that you believe that he was doing incorrectly with how he was putting on a comedy show. And uh, he defended himself and got very upset at you and couldn't believe that you set it on here. And he was really hurt and stormed out of the room. And then, you know, we sort of were sat around and talked about the importance of comedians getting paid and whether or not that was the right thing to do and what the real issue is. And you know, it's uh, there's, there's a side to be tad on both men's point of view. Brian's and yours, you know, there's a side to be had on Brian's about the way you presented it, did it, you did it like when you were in this elevated state and you were responding to him questioning New Year in the south by southwest thing and you attacked, some people don't know this just to make sure people know I told Marshall knocked to upload.

Speaker 2:          02:03:21       Yeah. Okay. I know you're not trying to just do not trying to make it more than it already is and Brian is a very upset about it and you know, his side of it is that he did pay some people and there's a lot of expenses and that he had to pay for taxes and he's paying for the rent to keep that place open. And you know, to be honest, he probably to bit off more than he could chew and he didn't realize how much was ree was involved in not just putting on a podcast where you just being the producer of the podcast, but also running a comedy show at the same time, calling people, booking in, having the community and show up, put them on, give her a flyer, trying to get people to come put tweeting it, making a big deal. It, it's more involved.

Speaker 2:          02:04:04       It's not like those guys that like do comedy juice or something like that. There's a lot of work involved in that. There's mailing lists and there's, you know, I get their milling this all the time and they're constantly emailing me all the time asking me to come and perform. Like they're, it's a business for these guys. They, they, they're trying to, you know, there's a lot of work behind it. I think it got away from him and he's corrected it and he's corrected it now. And because of this confrontation, the good that's come out of it is that the money situation has been taken completely out of his hands. So he doesn't have to worry about that anymore. Yeah. Which is cool. And my shows can still pay for the rent. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:04:37       Here's what's not cold. And this is the thing it taught me. Um, cause I've been seeing this in the positive thing, thankfully in my life mostly. But what happened was, even though it didn't get uploaded at the time, it could have, Marshall could have been like, fuck that. I'm not the leading that. That's good. That's going to battle. Get traffic. That's good. Right. You could have been an asshole. I didn't know where I was totally wrong. Shouldn't have brought it up in a public ward. I shouldn't have brought up in a public way. I was totally fucking wrong. Even if I felt like Brian, uh, confronting me about south by southwest was wrong. What I did was, so if Brian was throwing a negative energy ball my way, I grabbed that negative energy. Bob Expanded it and tried to stuff it down his throat out it. I didn't feel good. I was angry. Right, right. And so then Brian got mad and then the energy ball, he explained to exponentially increase the energy ball by, uh, having a blowout and saying, fucked up, getting Trostle. Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:05:33       He doesn't do well when criticized anyway. But my criticized like that in a very confrontational, confrontational manner on a podcast. Yeah. It's very upsetting for him. Right. But, you know, he didn't react to it. So it was a boat. It was bad reactions on both sides. Neither one of you guys reacted and verbally, you know, if you wanted to look back at yourself and how that whole thing went down, you know, where you're going back and forth to each other. Were you okay?

Speaker 3:          02:05:55       I didn't go. That's the thing, man. I went back, I went, I went back at him once. Oh, I apologize. On my podcasts and I guess I'm gonna call it.

Speaker 2:          02:06:03       Yeah, we're good. You did. The initial words that you used were very confrontational in Atlanta. Yes. Yes. But then how you launched it off was very, dude, you look, use the words ripping off

Speaker 3:          02:06:15       Sarah being off. I said, Robin, I said, Robin, even worse, I said, he's robbing comedians and that's the fucking wrong word, uh, for not paying

Speaker 2:          02:06:23       people. And you will go back and you listen to it. What do you get out of it? Have you listened to it?

Speaker 3:          02:06:27       No, I don't want to fucking listen to it cause it's anchorman. Righteous anger. I, I, I can only on my side of the street, my side of the street when I attacked him, I was pissed. Right,

Speaker 2:          02:06:39       because you felt that he was incorrectly correcting you and then he was putting his 2 cents in. Yeah. In to an argument that you have. It's a very big one. It's not just about south by southwest, but it's about a lot of other organizations who don't pay the performance.

Speaker 3:          02:06:51       Exactly. And I think that the tides are shifting now and I think that that, uh, paradigm where you charged money for a shower and don't pay the comics is going to hopefully be gone permanently. Uh, because what I really liked about the south by south west video is that it, it, I think it encouraged some comedians to start speaking up. And I think artists are very afraid of confrontation and are afraid of speaking up about, uh, things that are obviously right now. Here's the time to speak up and there's a time to not speak up. And I think, uh, with Brian when I, I said, you're robbing comics that wasn't coming out of some altruism, you know, uh, state of wanting

Speaker 5:          02:07:35       to like be Gandy and how fucking comics that was coming. It's like, Oh, you slapped me, I'm going to slap you back. And so that's wrong. That's wrong action. That's not skillful, that's bad. And so I went on my podcasts and I, uh, and I apologize and I, uh, admitted that that was wrong. And also I think the term robbing, it's totally wrong because robbing implies that the person that you're, um, it implies forcefully taking something for someone. Whereas if someone goes and does a show with the ice house and Brian and said he's not paying or it didn't mention payment, then you're entering into an agreement where you're going to perform for free. So it's more of the performers deal, like it's, you decided to go and do that. So Robin is the wrong word. So there's that, but watching it explode, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          02:08:25       Watching the fireball grow bigger and bigger. It's been, um, a huge lesson for me, you know, and it really has taught me like, fuck man, you've got to learn to, uh, if you're angry and especially your anger is at a friend. And even though like, I think Brian hates my guts permanently. Nah, he was, we've been friends for like, I don't know, seven years, eight years ago. Let me stab me with a pencil. I can with a fucking pencil. I'm sorry for that. I'm sorry that I did. I'll tell you this. Let me tell you this. I'm a lot less, sorry that I stabbed him with a pencil than I am that in a fucking public forum. I called him out on something that I should have addressed privately because when I stabbed him with a fucking pencil, he get Pocan my back on an airplane when I'm trying to sleep man.

Speaker 5:          02:09:16       And I had to fucking fight back. I don't feel bad about that was retarded baby is stupid. But that was just an instant reaction to being annoyed. What happened at the laughing skull was using a public forum to address a private issue and I think that that is not fucking cool. And the end result of that, even though that podcast didn't get uploaded, is that we've created a fucking car dash Ian episode with a death squad and that sucks man. There's a lot of fucking people who've been taking sides and and attacking me or attacking Brian or like, like all this stuff that ultimately, so now what, what, what happens? This is the fucking thing that happens. You Watch this thing that started off as a mid size negative energy ball turned into a big negative energy ball and then get fucking scattered and spread throughout the fucking Internet with people signing up and trying to say hurtful things or saying this person's right. That person's wrong. This is good, that's bad. This is why I say simplicity is the most important thing man, because it's like ultimately you just have to say, I forgive. You can pull it city man, just forgiveness. Just at some point. Simplicity is forgiveness. No, forgiving

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       is a simple act. It doesn't have to be complicated. It doesn't have to be going into judge Judy mode and stretching out the events to see who was right, who was wrong and how did you do that and why did you do that? It's just the simple thing of being like, look, let's stop playing shit. Ping Pong with negative,

Speaker 4:          02:10:51       it was back when we were talking about earlier about like money being needed to to keep score, fights with friends. There's, there's someone has to be the one who was right. Someone else to be the one who was wrong, someone else's were the one who one lawyer and someone has to lose. It's like when people break up a little divorced and you're like, oh, she won that one. You know, she got out of that one pretty good. She gets this amount a month and you know, that poor fucking guy, he really lost that one. It sucks. And yeah, it's funny. It's weird. It's weird man. And it's all ego based. That's all about our whole society is about achievement, forward progress, you know, treading into New Territories and taking them over. I mean it's one of those, yeah. Whether it's actual physical territories like new lands or whether it's a technological territory, he's like new, you know, new inventions and innovations. We're always moving forward. So like you have to like, okay, you're out of a relationship. How'd you do? I did great. Why I only married that asshole for three years and he has to give me $1 million, you know,

Speaker 5:          02:11:50       look man. But you know, like, so I think, uh, I don't have anything else to say about that. Right. I think I'm done talking about that, but I do want to say,

Speaker 4:          02:11:57       well he, his, uh, in his defense, his, uh, what, what he's upset about more than the fact that he brought her up with a podcast and did it like that and through them, one of the bus that even in your apology, you still said that he wasn't paying the comedians and he did pay some of the Comedians, you know, and apparently, you know, I wasn't really, I, I told them it'd be good idea to pay the comedians, but we never really had too many conversations about who got paid and who didn't. It was up to his discretion. Thomson Reuters, some people got burnt Christ or something that people got paid and so I'm good, you know, but there was different shows where there wasn't that many seats that were sold, you know, where he did his own shows. Two shows a word that's successful. Right.

Speaker 5:          02:12:38       Okay. So what, so what this turns into at this point is like real fucking like, to me it's like, I guess so like if the apology's not correct, then basically what we've created now is a situation where it's like you didn't submit to me properly. You know what I mean? I don't, I don't know, like, okay, I know you play fucking Cat Stevens peace train and said that you were, uh, my friend. You know what I mean? Like, like I know that you did that you didn't do it in exactly the right way. And then if that happens, then it's like, okay, then what? You didn't do this and I didn't do. Now all of a sudden, Shit Ping pongs happening again should ping pong, you know what I mean? And it's like, fuck man, like, isn't like the, isn't it like the, the, the best thing to do to like number one, uh, address this situation and I'm addressing it publicly now because it was brought in at the public forum. It isn't the best that you do to address it

Speaker 7:          02:13:32       privately. Isn't that the number one, like best, best way to handle it? Um, and number two,

Speaker 4:          02:13:37       well boy, it wasn't his fault. It was made public. It was really my fault. I was explaining to the Ra why you guys were in and are in an argument and you know, in the middle of the podcast we're just talking. I didn't really stop and think whether or not this is a smart thing to, to re expose. Right. And, but, but, but you must be upset about how it happened. And I know how I feel after every sort of yelling argument that I've ever been on. My was like, no, it was really good.

Speaker 7:          02:14:03       Tends to, I see someone saying, Fuck Duncan Trussell in front of half, possibly half a million people. That felt really weird cause I, um, I, you know, like it's tough for me to imagine a situation where I would be angry enough to like try to publicly disparage somebody in that intense away. You know what I mean? I just, I, I wouldn't, I don't think I do that. And my thought was a really fucking pissed. So

Speaker 4:          02:14:31       yeah, these trains were going to make it all work out, bro. Well, that's my, that's what I wrote. So I'm going to come together. He's trained by that silly bitch. This piece train asshole became a Muslim. He fucking plus. No Muslims are some of something. Okay. Oh yeah. But he was calling for Salmon Rushdie to be killed when we got off a piece track. It's crazy. Who was talking about how the Quran says that someone rushed, he's gotta go gotta go gotta go. Recently I make a little [inaudible] cash. Have a little bit of a comeback. I saw him playing his use of Islam now. Yeah,

Speaker 7:          02:15:17       Jack on Sa. It's very sad. Yeah, that is a sweet song. Matt,

Speaker 4:          02:15:21       who's got a lot of great songs, he's got some beautiful songs and he's obviously an incredibly sensitive guy. But back to the whole situation, I think you have to treat your friends the way you treat someone that you love, like a wife, you know you, you go to, you can't, you can't insult them. You can't lash out at them. You can't do it. It's a, it's a shitty thing when it happens and you got to make it all better after it's over. And you've got to, you've got to really, truly feel bad about it and you got to really truly sort of correct yourself and make sure that you never put yourself into such a situation of a, almost like verbal combat with a brother, you know? Yes. Um, Brian for sure has some maturing to do on an, you know, and I think he's aware of it himself and he started out at a different time than we did. He's a good dude though, man. I've, I've been with Brian for a long time. We've worked together for like a decade. He's a good dude, man. He's, uh, you know, he's got a lot of Manchild in them, but that's, that's part of what makes him funny. Yeah. That's part of what makes him unique. And PS, here's the fucking thing. No one needs to be attacking. Exactly. Nobody. You guys aren't, there's no bad guys. There's no need for there to be an enemy involved here. It's crazy. Yeah. There, there's no, there's like,

Speaker 7:          02:16:30       there's this, it's like what we got going on here with his foot, whatever you want to call it, the death squad, this podcast, our podcasts. Is it an emergent art form that's incredibly beautiful and all of us are contributing to it in our own way. And a lot of people seem really invested in it and a lot of people seem to authentically upset by this fight. And, and, and so I think like out of respect for this, whatever this weird fucking thing is that we're building here, we've got to like learn how to forgive each other and to let bygones be bygones because otherwise the community that we're forming is weak, you know, and then, and then in a week, fucking thing's going to fall apart. You know, you need, I think you need blow outs like this. I would prefer for them to happen in private, but I think in this case it got into the public eye fine.

Speaker 7:          02:17:20       Uh, the fact that it is in the public eye creates even more of a reason to resolve it in a civilized way. That doesn't mean somebody gets hurt or somebody gets fucking, uh, excommunicated or somebody gets like permanently mad. It means that because if we can't figure it out, if we can't figure out how to resolve something as silly as this, then how can we fucking talk about stub dropping bombs? No. I mean, how can we stuck when that's what that is in the macro, right. You know what I mean? And that's why I think it takes at some point, if you look at the back and forth that happened in war, it's somebody did this to someone and then they did something back in the night and something back bigger and they did something back bigger. It goes on forever. At some point you just have to be like, I'm sorry, I forgive you. I'm sorry. And that's it.

Speaker 4:          02:18:09       And that's when Brian goes fucked. I could trust,

Speaker 7:          02:18:12       right? Yeah. I know, man. That's the fucking day that, but, but you know what, it's like, you can only handle your side of the street, right. You know what I mean? That's all you, that's all that you could do. You can only handle your side of fucking things. That's all you can do. That's it.

Speaker 4:          02:18:25       Yeah. You know, I think all of us get caught up in life and stress and shit and this and that. And there's words that come out of your mouth that are poorly chosen. This, this is ideas that are expressed selfishly. No, we all, we all make mistakes. Especially when you're, you're fucking busy and you're not getting enough sleep. Real stressed out, always in the middle of a million different things. Like I know you are, and I certainly am. I ever make mistakes. People make a lot of fucking mistakes. You got to know when you'd been friends with someone for a long time. The essence of who that person is. No, you gotta, you gotta be a nice guy both when you are in charge and when you are the employee or the person has to listen, follow directions, whether you're the fan or whether you're the performer, whether the police officer or the guy who has to talk to the cop because his car got stolen.

Speaker 4:          02:19:15       You know who in the fuck you know, we, we have to figure out a way to, to always communicate with respect. It's just so hard to develop a human being that's completely and totally honest that we live in this world of and half truths and bullshit lies. And then behind the lies there's things that are true but make no sense like legislation, laws and all of it adds up to be this really confusing, frustrating, unfair feeling of life in general, just as a pattern of your whole fucking situation. But all of it, all of it can be cured by the simple truth that we have to start turning on each other is if we are treating ourselves, living another life, if we are all this one thing that is born into this world in various circumstances and various biological situations in various states of the world and various various climates, but at the soul of it all behind the sex and behind that the, the, the, the, you know, the height and the weight and the essence of what a fucking human being is.

Speaker 4:          02:20:20       Could, it could just be as easy on you. You could be that guy, you could be this guy, you were, you are stripped of culture and language. And what I am is the same thing. I'm just going through this in a completely different ride with a total different flesh vehicle. And we happen to see each other along the journey and we'll become friends and you know, to be in our struggle together and enhanced each other. But at the end of the day with the same fucking thing. And once we realize that I'm the same with some poor fuck that was born in Afghanistan, is living in a cave. I'm the same as that guy. I just got a real better roll the dice and I was born in New Jersey. You know what I'm saying? I mean, is that the only way we're ever going to get over this hump of existence as if we drop all the bullshit and then the one law that we should all recognize, the one thing that we should all practice is the ideal that you were me an imu and we are moving completely different lives but inside the body, inside that the booming of what he is one who think of you.

Speaker 4:          02:21:23       I could easily be you. I can easily be my mother. I can easily do this asshole. It was down the street from me that I can't talk to cause he's dumb. I can, you can do this guy. I could be that guy. I could have been born here. It's just some crazy situation where we may I be the very same thing living through different epochs, living through different biological identities, lifting through different genetics and different social circumstances and but at the root of it all, we could be the same fucking thing. And we essentially are. Yeah, we'll essentially are for sure. It's our own individual experiences that confused the fuck out of us. If we, if we really started treating people like that, if you really looked at the word bite, that, and it doesn't always mean that you're going to give that person everything they want because then you could spoil you.

Speaker 7:          02:22:06       Well, that's right. I mean it's, you can't be phony about it. You know what I mean? Like you gotta like you have to address it from a real place. You can't be phony. But if you, if you have as an intention and dealing with conflict, whichever one's going to have wanting a that

Speaker 4:          02:22:27       wanting, not just to rev resolution, but an evolution.

Speaker 7:          02:22:30       Yeah, that's it. If that's your fucking intention behind it, it's going to work out great. Yeah, it's going to work out okay. You, it might be turbulent and might be weird, but if that's your intention, then it's a lot different than the intention being, I'm gonna win this, right? I'm going to conquer. I'm going to be the one who comes out on top that only creates more Shit Ping Pong and more negativity in the world. Right. That's the thing that we've got to like don and this thing with Brian and I'm sure everyone's got an example of this happening in their life or we'll have it deal with it in a way that's like accelerating the community, making the community stronger, making the community more.

Speaker 4:          02:23:10       How about just last karmic impact outside of all that? I mean it does get complicated and start really ultra defining everything as far doing it for the community, but just do the do what is what feels like the healthiest thing to do. What's the healthiest thing to do? Drop all the rest of the problems. Trump on the motion. Just drop it. It's done. Trauma and learn from it and never be that guy again. You know, we, we have to accept that this was a trial and error sort of a situation in life, especially the generation that you and I come from, you know, you and your thirties me and my forties we were essentially one of the first generations to be awake. We're one of the first generations to use the internet and it's sort of exchange so much information back and forth with each other that will kind of reformulating idea of how the world works.

Speaker 4:          02:23:57       You know, I mean, we don't really necessarily trust our parents that brought us into this thing. We don't necessarily trust our parents parents too, to have a full sort of uh, an account of what, what really is going on in this life biologically, physically, geo, politically. We are one of the first generations to truly have a decent grasp of it because of our use of the Internet. So we're a lot of what we're doing as adults is essentially trying to re govern our, our own culture to re refigure out how we're communicating with each other. If the New York giants fans really want to beat the fuck out of the Raiders and they don't even know him, is that, isn't there something wrong with that? Like is it, could that not be us on another side of the country? When do you not understand that you really want to go and you know, you go to a fucking ball game in Philly and they break your leg in the hallway cause you're wearing the wrong shirt, but that stuff happens.

Speaker 4:          02:24:50       That's you man. That's you on the ground living a different life and you just stomped on your thigh bone and snapped it. You know? And that is, that's really unfortunate aspect of life. This sort of a tribal thing that you know, might've existed in that book, the road in that movie. You know what, what could happen if the shit hits the fan, but where we have to understand that this shit's not hitting the fan right now. It's not hitting the fan at all. This is, this is nothing like the shit hits the fan. Right? Right. There was a guy, but I was mentioning earlier that was talking about how life right now that we were unhappy but yet we live very much like kings and emperors, you know, did a hundred years ago, which I thought was really stupid because first of all the idea of we don't live in like an emperor. You don't have a Harem, can't order them around. You can't have people killed if they talk shit, you don't have people can you around on a giant tray every you go also, you're not eating rancid fucking to me. Yeah, you got a fridge. Yeah. You're not dying from whooping cough because nobody knows what the fuck it is. And they think he got possessed by a demon.

Speaker 5:          02:25:59       But can I tell you about something? I don't know how long I've been doing this, but please, can you look something up dude? Yeah, sure. Augmented reality, sandbox, augmented reality sandbox, this fucking thing man is he can't living in the best. It's a Xbox connect set up over a sandbox or the projector blasting flowing water into it. So as you like move your finger through the sandbox, like water flows around and like grass forms. It's like the future of video games, man. Especially with this new quantum sand that apparently computers can construct into shapes they're talking about. Did you find it? Whoa. Yeah Dude. What the fuck is this man? It's fucking bad ass. So explain it one more time please. It is an x-box connect that somehow detecting changes in the terrain of the sandbox and projecting water and uh, grass and sand over different parts of it.

Speaker 5:          02:26:55       I think based on how high or how low the sand is. So if you like go really like if you hold your hand over it makes water up here running through the sandbox and if you run your fingers through it, I think water appears as though there was like water under the sand at the beach. You don't want my fucking computer runs slow as shit probably when you're streaming a podcast. When I'm streaming a podcast. What's that about? Well, it's cause I guess there's only a certain amount of bandwidth that's weak. Is it really that hard to make a podcast folks? I know every time I try to go online it's slug like, I'm sorry. So I was looking that up with augmented reality. I'm trying to pull up the youtube video. It's just so cool. It's just, okay, now I'm looking at it. Wow. And so how has it work? Uh, and the x box connect I think identifies distances. I don't know how it, how it works. People have, so you're drawing in the sandbox and then as you scoop up Sam, the sandbox, it, it's showing on a projection screen. It's projecting directly onto the sand. Why am I above? Yeah, rejecting changes in colors and it looks very psychedelic. Super sack about your trip. A kid out, make kid make sand castles and that shit man. Next level, next level sandcastles. Check starcraft on that fucking

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       thing. I'm gone. I'm gone. You're going to star trek star craft it every day in my life was just like downtime till Prometheans comes out. I'm just like, what? I would like to clone Ridley Scott and give him an infinite budget and just give them all the acid and mushrooms she needs and him and HR Geiger and just lock them in a room together and just make a million alien movies. I swear to God, I'm in thinking about inducing a calm. I just to wake up and yelled to go to from atheists want so awesome though. It's so dorky. Delicious. I can't wait. So you were saying about um, this, uh, my, my lust to go see the Avengers. I feel like I'm getting away with something. I really do. I'm going to bring the Mustang to the stupidest fucking kid car that I had. This fucking, I have a Shelby gt 500.

Speaker 4:          02:29:16       It's just rude, loud, Super American car. It's so American man. Everything about it. They don't make another Carl didn't know no one in the rest of the world makes a car like a Shelby Mustang slides all over the place. It's really, it handles pretty well considering I went and test drove cars yesterday. Man there are so fucking nice after you've been driving around it. 89 fall out off cars or cars or the one one my my number one technological thrill. Like the thing that I enjoy the most. I just love the craftsmanship. I love how someone's created something. I love the different philosophies behind cars at the high revving cars of Germany or the like the deep low torque muscle cars of America. I just, I think they're fascinating to me. It's they're moving works of art that they sell. You know like if you buy a new corvette, like there's a lot of people that think Corvettes or douchey cause a lot of douchebags drive Corvettes.

Speaker 4:          02:30:10       Well Corvettes are fucking amazing. It's an amazing piece of construction and engineering do. But isn't that a funny thing where like Pete, because people think they're supposed to think it's not cold. An object can get a douche bag. Its reputation and most of your with that object. Sorry it was that my fucking phone. Sorry. You have ridiculous motherfucker. Yeah, a forest horn. Oh okay. Turn that Shit on mute son. I don't know how is almost done on the side of it. I won't turn down all the way it goes to vibrate. Stupid. The thing on the side of the above when your fingers are, when you fuck finger is that fuck finger, that finger right there, man. The chooses crunching and retarded. There's a little lever on the top of the side of your phone. The top of the side. You see that? Yeah. That shuts it to vibrate. Yes. Ah. That changed my life so retarded. All this shit. How do you not know how to fucking turn your vibrator eyes? The man at night, that fucking warrants come waking me up. Oh my God. You idiot fucking idiot. You didn't know how the fuck do you have an iPhone and not know where the vibrate button is can make me sad, man. You fucking just changed my life, man.

Speaker 4:          02:31:34       Fucking bother me nonstop to, I've been looking at some of these android phones they have now. I know I get like a lusty envy with certain phones, but one of them have been looking at is this galaxy note. I've been watching videos and one of the things that everybody keeps saying is once you get this thing, it's really hard to go back to her regular phone cause it's five inches wide and it's four G. It's wicked fast is a crazy fast processor and I'm watching these people use it, play with it online and take pictures with it and draw on the picture like he right, like almost stupid. And you could send it in email or sending a text message and browsing the Internet. I mean it's fucking huge man. It's five inches. Yeah man. I feel like the little screen on the iPhone, it's not enough.

Speaker 4:          02:32:16       I think it gives you eyestrain bad thing. It fucks up your eyes. Just thing. It's better. This fucking things better. I may switch. I may switch from the iPhone to this. Not that it's switched from the iPhone. No say that man. But these new ice cream sandwich, Google phones are pretty fucking complicated, man. They're, they're really bad at taking that risk again. Knowing kiss my ass. I had a fucking shit boy for so long. It really not like those old Android's though. I picked up a shit android once. I had a shit android for one day and I was like, this is a drunk, retarded iPhone. It was really bad. This is perfect, but these aren't like that. These new ones are not like that. This new operating systems called ice cream sandwich and apparently it's the shit they in the new Samsung Galaxy three that's another one that just came out in England.

Speaker 4:          02:32:59       I don't think it's all out in America yet. That's another huge one. It's like 4.8 inch screen and Norma screen not, not quite as big as the note. The note is like five plus I think five three but it's a huge screen and like when you touched the outside of it rip, it was like water. It's like it's, it's got the effect that there's water on it. When you rub your hand across it, it takes a snapshot of the screen if that's all you have to do. It's like you're a magician, which you do that. They're bad ass man. Yeah. Which is going to lead to a lot of accidental screenshots, but people are going to be fucking, that dropped their phone in the ground and it looks like it's a swipe, but really it's just passing by a Dick. Take pictures of ball sacs and all kinds of unexpected shit. All kinds of, what's the word we're looking for? Candid, candid shot.

Speaker 7:          02:33:46       Camden. Random Vagina shots. Whoa. What happened? This is an adult to screenshots. Yeah. There's a lot of the camera's view, dude. My team. You know what I'm afraid of, man? I'm afraid that like, what's here's what's going to happen. This is what I think's going to happen to me when I get conspiratorial and worry about the crazy shit we talk about on here. Oh, I think one day the feds are going to come, they're going to take me, they're going to do the old Bill Hicks thing where they take you into a room, but instead of showing a video of an assassination, they're going to show a screen filled with mov and meet, jerking off

Speaker 4:          02:34:21       what one your camera is, right. They're all there and next to it, the different things. I was jerking off to and they're going to show me that and be like, hey man, you want to keep saying the hippy shit? You want to keep talking about that cause look I want to keep talking and he'd be boy, hey what's this? What's this? Is this German? Is Porn junk? And that you are looking at who's, is it possible to convert the entire government into a positive force? Is it possible to have people that are really looking out to do the right thing and get it all together or is the job of working for the government? So fucking unrewarding and boring but everyone just falls into a place of non innovation. Non-Responsibility thanking the diffusion of responsibility that comes with the corporation also falls upon you when you're in government. It's just, it seems so few, a few tiles. It seems so huge. It seems so impossible that you just sort of give up and come. You just become a part of the wave.

Speaker 7:          02:35:15       Right now it's, I don't know how you fix it. So like all I can think about is like, uh, in the micro you fix it. And if every, if I'm, the majority of people start improving the their lives and the lives of people around them and actively seeking to put positive energy out in the world. And maybe that'll sort of, um, uh, transform the government itself in a real way. But as long as people are getting caught up worrying about the macro and thinking that everything's coming to a screeching halt and everything's fucked up and they might as well just live like idiots and give up trying to be happy, then shit, we'll keep continue to perpetuate itself in the neck in a negative way. So I think the idea is it's like, yeah, things are fucked up the world. Nancy Grace's world is a Shitty fucking world, but let's not worry about Landlease Linnux got strangled in the everglades and let's start worrying about the way that we're treating our fucking why for our friends or our kids or whatever, and deal with that. And then if enough people started doing that, and I think a big change would happen in the world, man,

Speaker 4:          02:36:17       definitely change. Look, everybody can change and everybody can change their own environment by surrounding yourself with other people that are like minded. That is possible. And that's one of the things that I think that this podcast does. We've talked about this before, but it's a, it's, it's important to recognize that we're aware of this, that this, this is not something that existed when we were young. We didn't, we didn't have access to people that were just for sort of no real, I mean there's no, I want to say a no obligation. There's no real direction that we're trying to go with us. We are just trying to express ourselves 100% honestly. Yeah. There's no ulterior motive. There's no agenda. There's no, there's no deception. It's just this is, this is how we really view the world. Right? And when you're stuck somewhere and you don't have people like that around you, this is the only way you can get that. And through this, it allows people to connect light, mine, likeminded people to connect through Twitter and through Facebook and whatever. And they seek each other out and improve the actual environment they live in. And then it starts these exponential changes all over the world. That's the one way, in my opinion, whenever we change any government anyways, expose them to new ideas that are more satisfying than the stupid dumb conquer model that they'd been using since before the days of gangs.

Speaker 7:          02:37:36       That's it, man. We got to figure that out. We have to figure out what that looks like.

Speaker 4:          02:37:40       Well that's the, it looks like the Internet. That's sort of both sides. Reddit, do you ever notice the only thing that exactly it, the owner knows the only thing that doesn't, doesn't want to hear your bullshit. You know, there, there's, there's isolated pockets, there's isolated, you know, places where you can go like Stormfront websites and we can do is go hang out with only Nazis and you know, they'll have, you know what I mean? And we didn't do a lot of those out there. You could just do that. But the overwhelming social network interaction, the overwhelming experience seems to be the distribution of information. You know, there's good and bad, you know? Good and bad, but the district distribution of information, the exposure of reality.

Speaker 7:          02:38:20       Yeah, it's incredible man. And it's like definitely if you look back at history and the way power is always fought to subvert the flow of information and suddenly there's a thing that is like a truth volcano now and there's no way to put a fucking cork on it. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:38:34       no dude, if we had this, if this was a radio show and we were in 1916 is a pirate radio show, they put us in jail. Oh yeah. They would come after us and punish them. Jail giant difference between the world of post 1993 which is really sort of the one of the first few years of the Internet being like a public entity that I can remember and maybe it happened a few years before that for the real hardcore guys like the real hardcore geeks. But for me, 1993 is about what it, and that's a, that's a different fucking era. There might as well been before that there was no cell phones either. All around happened at the same time as well, you know, essentially in a few years post, you know, it all kind of bubbled together into one big sort of a community can of soup.

Speaker 7:          02:39:15       Yeah, man. It's incredible. And it's also incredible how positive it it can be.

Speaker 4:          02:39:21       Can Be. Yeah. Yeah. This, yeah, this more positive for us, you know, for sure and more positive at the shows and what are people enjoying themselves. We were having shows a way we've never had before. So the kind of shows were having where we're going and thousands of people were there and the thousands of people are screaming and having fun and, and this is just more massive burst of positive energy will that massive bursa positive energy all came out of doing something like this, doing this podcast, connecting with all those people out there flowing their head with something to think about while they're working, while they're doing mundane tasks where the commuting all of it for free, all of it without an agenda and all of that. We'll see the what it does is it spreads out more positivity and it makes you want to write more shit and it makes you want to perform more comedy and get you have more material for them and do more shows and okay. And

Speaker 7:          02:40:09       it fucking rocks your consciousness when the, when the freaks you and say, Hey, listen, I, I'm a, I'm a fellow, my disciple of crawling. Hey, why don't you check out this book book for and then you order, all right, I'll fucking get booked for, and then you're reading crawling. Suddenly you're like, holy fucking shit. This is some intense shit here. Some of this is right on and real or that Guy Matt stacks from this info. I love you. He sent me all these fucking books. I've been reading these books and getting stoned and reading these books and just start shuttering and stoner or like, or

Speaker 4:          02:40:42       did you fucking getting the Catholic Church? All this shit

Speaker 7:          02:40:45       set over. The Catholic church is all coming from this one fucking book that he sent to me. And, and that's the other cool thing. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:40:51       that's good. If you don't know about this info, just go out and get your being lied to. Yeah. It's amazing. It's amazing. Anybody says there's no conspiracies is a fucking idiot because like as we were talking about with the nine 11 there had to be a conspiracy in the dynamic on the enemy's side. So there are conspiracies and human nature and they do pull things off and if you don't think they have in the past, you're being silly. You're being incredibly silly. That's how it runs.

Speaker 7:          02:41:18       Yeah. But yeah, it's, there's obviously conspiracies. There needs to be conspiracies. How about every time you fucking, I mean, yeah, there's many conspiracies and huge conspiracies anyway. Yeah, it's what the whole point is. What we have going on here is not a one sided thing. We've got a conversation afterwards. People where they, anytime, yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:41:37       they were connecting with people and that's why it's so cool to do those things. We'll do after the show, we'd go out and take pictures of people for fucking hours for hours. We just go wade out into the crowd and take pictures. I'm fine. That's right. Yeah. And these people are overwhelmingly cool. Overwhelmingly cool. I, yeah, 99.9% nine nine nine nine nine. Yeah. And even the ones on our core just fucking probably just freaking out. Just a little too drunk. I have noticed a little bit of that. Yeah. Fucking poor drunks. Wow. Sad bitches. Yeah. But it's uh, it's, other than that, it's been overwhelmingly positive and that all came from this one thing. You know, it all, it, all, it all came from this one idea, this desire to express yourself and express information, discuss things, and to force ourselves to have these conversations on a regular basis.

Speaker 4:          02:42:29       And Duncan and I, we started having these conversations when he was working at the comedy store and are very similar. That's how we became friends. Donovan was the guy who you'd call and he'd say, Hey man, I'm going to be in town Friday and Saturday he drove me up and Duncan would, you know, he would write down the lineups and the given the Mitzi and Mitzi would decide like, where to put everybody. So Duncan may not call him up. Hey man, we'll be in town Friday. What's going on. I'm like, dude, I just read this book. Okay. And we would go into these crazy fucking rabbit hole conversations because sometimes the phone wouldn't ring at the comedy store for an hour, you know? So you and I would just keep talking. We'll just have long ass crazy conversations about all kinds of weird shit.

Speaker 7:          02:43:07       Yeah man. But you know, like you, you pretty much gave me like my big break cause you started taking me out on the road with you when I sucked. Well I, you know, you always had potential. No it wasn't that you saw that and that meant a lot. Cause like, like having like you'd be like, hey man, like I can remember, I'll never forget this shit man. I can remember being in the Olr and doing this joke. I don't even do it anymore. But it was like being in a bad relationship is like having an octopus stuck to your face every once in a while it whispers to you. Do you still have some dumb joke? But I remember like you saw that and after it you're like, that was fucking funny man. And I was like, Whoa, Holy Shit Man Brogan thinks that joke's fight. That was a big moment. You really do help. Like a lot of young comics man, you up a lot of fucking car. You like really have like a, a, a sort of patron thing happening with people.

Speaker 4:          02:44:03       Well that's nice if that's true. I, I, I love comedy man is still my favorite thing to watch as an audience member. You know, I think it's the greatest art form where is as far as me, you know, like what, what entertains me. I'll just love watching a good comic more than anything. So I, you know, I love like helping, I love watching guys become killers. I remember watching Ari Shaffir go from being the guy who was like kind of a little bit uncomfortable on stage, trying to find his feet to one day, you know, just slowly but surely becoming a killer. And now I just watch, I'm so seeing Ari crushed in front of thousands of people and I remember taking him on the road. Yeah, I remember I took him to Denver. I was taking Mike and Mike Young couldn't make it for some reason, so it took Ari and Ari just fucking lit the place on fire. And I was like, God Damn, look at all I should fear. All of a sudden he's a, he's a real comedian. It's beautiful. It's beautiful to watch your friends grow and prosper and become real comedians.

Speaker 7:          02:44:57       Fucking encouraged me to do it. The pop it ag and fucking crabs. It could never work. I'd be like, just do it. No, fuck them. That's your bit. It was awesome. Brilliant. But a lot of fucking, a lot of comments we're bringing people on the road of them would not racking, recommend before their sets be like, hey dude, do that fucking really uncomfortable safety cause I want to put it like to come out, do a horrified crap. Not just the crowd that's like, like seeing someone bomb but a crowd. It's like maybe seeing like either someone who's as schizophrenia or like a say tannic.

Speaker 4:          02:45:38       Well, you know, I mean, I had this conversation with all he wants, uh, on the road when we're talking about trying out new stuff and bombing or you know, or what have you, you know, like the, the willingness to take chances and then sometimes it doesn't work out. And he said, yeah, but sometimes you know, you go on the road and you don't want to take those chances. I said, well, you don't have to worry about that because you're opening up for me. Right. So like it doesn't matter if you bomb, never, you're never going to get fired. I know that you're a funny comedian. He, as long as you're trying be when it, when I wouldn't have that feeling is when someone wasn't trying to get better. Right. And you know, there are people that just get to a certain point and they just completely plateau and then they redo the same jokes for a decade. I mean, we, we all know comics that are like that. I have no desire to be around those types of people. But the type of guys like you or like all your, anybody who was improving and always working on your stand up, I was like, go fuck around up there, man. If it doesn't work out, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It's all about developing. Oh Dude. But you don't necessarily

Speaker 7:          02:46:41       tip toe around the fact. And some of our jokes don't work.

Speaker 4:          02:46:44       Gotta be honest about that. But I want you to be honest to me too mean Eddie Bravo, uh, said to me once, he goes, man, I don't like that joke you're doing. And I said, yeah, I'm kind of forcing it, right? I'm like, yeah, thank you for telling me that. Thank you. Cause I'm fucking forced in that joke. That was a joke that I would like kept in my arsenal, but I'd committed to for whatever reason, it just wasn't good. Now though, that kind of Shit helps, man. That's it. Fuck yeah, man. You need to know. You need to know when you're, you're being repetitive. You need to know when you're, you, you overuse the word fuck. And you make for an uncomfortable moment when someone's listening to you, you're, you're doing when you're on stage is you're essentially controlling the pattern of thought that goes through someone's mind.

Speaker 4:          02:47:23       Cause you're going to bring up various topics and various subjects that put various images and feelings and people and you have to get them to appreciate where your mind is coming from. Well if you add an and a bunch of extra frogs or you're stammering or you're coming off like a goof, which oftentimes we do, especially on this podcast, we got too high. Like I couldn't remember the young Turk thing earlier. So we go into a stammer mode, you know, but no one wants to listen to that and then allow you to continue controlling the pattern of thought. That's why it's an uncomfortable moment. That uncomfortable moment is the realization that you at that moment you shouldn't be in control. And unfortunately you are. Cause there's only two people in the room. Regardless of the fact that half a million people are going to listen to those. There's only two people in the room,

Speaker 7:          02:48:03       two people. Sometimes I've gotten on stage and fucking forgotten what's about to come out of my mouth. That's the worst thing where you're like in the middle of something and that's happened to me a couple of times where I'm like too high and I'm like Shit,

Speaker 4:          02:48:15       do this joke and we gotta be careful. You know one sucks when you do more than one show in a night. Yeah. And then you get rid of like confused. Well because when you do more than one show, what happens is there's a state of mind when you're on stage, which is like let's, let's just consider it getting on the trolley and sitting in the same seat. Okay. You get on the trial, you were in that same seat. That is the state of mind that you at when you're on stage. Like I'm in this driver's seat and here we go. I'm on the trolley. Yeah. Well when you're on the trolley again for the second show, and especially if you do it like I do it where I don't really have necessarily a particular order. I think I have an idea probably how I'm going to close, but I don't know how the fuck I'm going to open and I might go from here to there and I might jump all over the place. And when I do that then I can get lost and say, I don't remember if I did it.

Speaker 7:          02:49:01       Alrighty dude. It's um, yeah, it's really easy to lose your focus up there, but thank God it doesn't have all the time. You know,

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       I just realized this too, man thing a problem. I've got to fucking piss dude. Why don't we go pistols ramp this up. I can talking for two hours. You wrap it up now. 50 minutes. Yeah, let's wrap it up now. So I think to wrap up the, the Brian thing, you know, I think we all learned a little something from this and I think, yeah, online feuds and just spats and all that stuff is just bitch shit. You know, what are the bridge? It's gross. Dun, Dun, Dun. I don't have to have a city of limitation to lift yourself above this life. When to get you back in the isolation tank to plug the fuck out of it. Sun doing pre sales for the first time ever in my life. He's a comedian. I'm like, goodness, tee shirts. We're going presales for tee shirts@theshopatduncantrostle.com they're awesome.

Speaker 4:          02:49:54       It's one of them is a pyramid. Killing a fucking vampire bat. If they order appreciate. How long was it before the, it's the shirt. Watch the ship and I put the order and on the 15th so then how long will it be til they actually get it? It's on the side. I think it'll be a couple of weeks. Couple of weeks. He can handle a couple of weeks. Folks, give something to look forward to. If you get them out, it's 20 bucks and if you wait, it said $2 extra and you can't. Duncan, you're crazy. You're a marketing genius. How I tell you dude, my penalty, my web guy, he came up with that sounds like a creep.

Speaker 4:          02:50:28       Gimmicky mother fucker. Just kidding. I can't help myself. The greatest stuff, Steve, I don't even know you and I love you, but you, I mean, you really establish that we are, we doing more podcasts this week. I'm not sure who I'm working out the next couple of ones this week, but a more red Ban as well. Don't worry, we'll bring my little buddy back into the mix. Um, and so, uh, I want to thank everybody that came to New York this past weekend. We had the fucking time of our lives mean can you can't get better than that. I played it yesterday. I played the audio of Joey Diaz going on stage. Oh my God. I'll pull it up again just because it's so ridiculous. It doesn't good. And you'd go Piss, I'll play this because I played it from Mrs Rogan and she almost didn't believe it. It doesn't really doesn't seem real. This is a Joey Coco Diaz going on stage in New York.

Speaker 1:          02:51:22       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          02:51:36       he hasn't even had a chance to say a word yet.

Speaker 4:          02:51:50       He had to stop them. It was just crazy. It was, um, it really represent to all of us. Uh, some, some sort of a, a real obvious paradigm shift and uh, you know, I can speak for every of us, for Joey, for Ari, for Dunkin, you know, we're very, very thankful that all this is happening. And uh, for me personally as a a guy who, uh, you know, I had, but I was the one who was on television and I was the one who was taking these guys on the road with me to see guys like Joey all the sudden become recognized and people appreciate him for what he is. Joey, it's always had a hard time with people recognizing his brilliance because he's so crazy and out there and wild with his comedy that until he was famous, until he was like an established personality like he has now, it's almost like it's too hot to handle is too much to deal with people nobody wanted to have in middle.

Speaker 4:          02:52:48       That was like a big deal with, with Joey Diaz. Like he couldn't get work on the road because he couldn't headline, but he couldn't middle because nobody wanted Joey Diaz on in front of them because he would just go up and fucking destroy. But my philosophy of comedy came out at the comedy store and uh, first of all what that meant was that we were all brothers in the comedy store. So it was like if I was going to take anybody in the road of me, I take my comedy store brothers who was always Ari Shaffir was always Duncan Trussell. It was, uh, you know, different people. See I'm Tripoli, different people that are comedy store brothers and Joey was always a comedy store brother. And so when I started taking them on the road with me, there was two reasons. One that cause he was a comedy store brother and two, because the, the philosophy of the comedy store also was you had to go, he wanted to go on with a bunch of other killers.

Speaker 4:          02:53:36       You didn't want to be the only guy that was good. You wanted to. The comedy store was a about a bunch of different guys being good, like the old outlaws of comedy, you know, with called the bow and Tennyson and like there's a bunch of guys that were really good Ron shock. There was a bunch of these dudes that were really good together and that, you know, so so t taking guys like Joey on the road and exposing him to all these people and then seeing them go on stage and these fucking gigantic rounds of applause he gets. It's beautiful. I couldn't be happier. It's amazing to me. It's like, um, it's like a vision that's sort of coming true. We have this idea when we used to do these, you know, when we were calling ourselves a death squad, we used to do these little videos.

Speaker 4:          02:54:18       I hired Brian do these death squad videos and there was, some of them were really short. Like one of them was Joey Diaz talking about Mcginn this gay guy and the gay guy beat him up. I mean there's a, there's a bunch of all, I'll probably get Brian to try to find them on, organize them. And put them online because some of them were really classic, but the idea didn't really come to fruition in the terms of doing it through these little video clips. The real way to get to know a guy like Joey is to get to know him on the podcast. If you him go off for hours and hours about criminal stories, about sneaking to some girls fucking bedroom at two o'clock in the morning and ain't no pussy and then escaping and the that. This is the crazy shit that he did. You know the Lucy snore Bush story has become so big that a guy at in Atlanta, did you see the stickers that he made?

Speaker 4:          02:55:02       He had, hello, my name is Lucy Snore, Bush teaching two stickers. There were, there were amazing man. It just to see that happening and to see it all come out of this, this one idea that you know, that man, I get this really talented group of friends and I think that if we all stick together and sort of, you know, help each other out and pump each other up, we make each other better and we, we make each other funny era and we create like a bigger footprint of positive energy. All of us together have one giant footprint of positive energy, but it has to be only back. And that's why it was very important to resolve this whole issue with, uh, with you and Brian. And you know, as I said, it's not as, it's not a clear cut case of either one person having done the right thing and there's errors made on both sides, both in the actual act itself and in the discussion of the act afterwards.

Speaker 4:          02:55:56       There's, there's some incorrect thinking and it's a negative thinking going on, but hopefully we'll work all that shit out. The most important thing is we're a, all of us in this fucking thing together. And the last negative bullshit that you can spread the law of forgiveness that you can give the more you can call people up and go, I'm fucking sorry, I'm really sorry in. The more the person listening you can go, it's all I do. It's all good dude. The more we can do that in this life, the more we realize that we're all capable in various situations, various circumstances of making colossal mistakes. It doesn't necessarily mean you're a horrible person. It just means sometimes we don't respond well to stress. Sometimes we don't respond well to character issues and we need to learn and we need to grow and he may be more appropriate than I am.

Speaker 4:          02:56:44       You may be further ahead, but show me, show me, show me how you got there. Don't, don't chastise, don't be angry and don't hate child elevate. We can all make this. We're not going to make utopia. It doesn't exist, but we can all make our environment and the people we come in contact with a little bit better and then my, when recording, we'll stop in three minutes.
