Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Boom, yes, boom. With live. What's up brother? How are you man? How are you? Joe? You got a little pocket hankie there, but I'll tell you,

Speaker 2:          00:00:16       so I'll tell you why I wear a pocket square please, because if you don't wear a pocket square, you have the appearance that you've been squeezed into a sports jacket or a suit for conventional reasons that your mom put you in there or off the church or something. We got to the office. As soon as you put a pocket square in there, you own the jacket if your idea and not someone else's idea. Whoo

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       dude. You're thinking several steps ahead. I like it. We'll get to get into this outage. We we're going to get into this. Well, we were talking before the podcast about these press junkets and about how you entertain yourself by forcing yourself to use a certain word.

Speaker 2:          00:00:57       Yeah, the danger. The. The worst thing in the film business is press junkets and as you were saying, that rather ineffective and that's my suspicion too. They're not that also inefficient and ineffective because you sit in the chair, someone comes in and they ask you a question, why, how, how good an actor is David Beckman is isn't on independence or whatever it is, and you answer it and some facile fashion. And on the full time you asked answer that question, your starting to Swat flies that aren't there. You're starting to go mad. So what happens is you have to play games with yourself so you get someone on the side to throw different words that you like valued in area and, or Marissa militude. And then that keeps you occupied because you're thinking when someone asks me about Beckman, his underpants have somehow got a stick in a verisimilitude and I'll tell you, it's not easy. And your answers become very creative.

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       Did they ask someone to be sincere and asked the same questions over and over and over again to them like they're half people. Keep filing in. A new person comes in and as I us. So tell us about this film and how did this get started? And so who, whose idea was it?

Speaker 2:          00:02:09       So, um, I sort of film jumbled medics caliber in about 1990 and uh, I was an impressionable young man of 10 and it was the first light knights in shining armor film I ever spoke to me. I wasn't particularly interested in Errol Flynn, uh, or any inclination that they did in the fifties in the Shell Nhra. But John Boorman's one was rather good. He's very aggressive and no one spoke to one another. They will shout it at one another. So it took some time before you realize that's why it was so intense. It's quite camp. So it had this sort of weird juxtaposition of being camp yet simultaneously aggressive and you know, they had a budget of $25 and the visual effects and lots of very shiny 19th century armor. And it made a real impression on me because it was, it was a voice, it was a creative voice.

Speaker 2:          00:03:07       So I made an impression on me and then somewhere in the attic of my mind, I relegate it until the point where I had enough creative ideas in my reservoir to bring it forward to make a film. And then someone gave me money and warner brothers wanted to make it and Yada Yada Yada. And then it was the challenge, I suppose, of trying to take us to join into this world, the fantasy epic fantasy, medieval he lord of the Rings, Econ of a world, and it's completely out of my wheelhouse. So I find the challenge provocative and exciting as well.

Speaker 3:          00:03:41       That's a fascinating era or a genre, you know, the fascinating world of fantasy, you know, nights and swords and bows and arrows and that, that realm for whatever reason, has been intoxicating to people for a long time.

Speaker 2:          00:03:56       Yeah. It's an archetype. So you're interested in farm and you're interested in nurses. Um, you're interested in the superheroes obviously. I mean, arguably Arthur was the first superhero because he's the guy that extracts the sword. And Gallup, we can do all sorts of wondrous things. And this myth is 1200 years old, 1400 years old. And it's as relevant today as it was then. But because it's an archetype that somehow kids the dress up as firemen, policemen, soldiers or nights. So we, it's almost like we relived it. It's like an outfit that we wore 1200 years ago, so you feel familiar in it.

Speaker 3:          00:04:41       Yeah. It's just. It's fascinating that one genre, that one sort of archetype is just locked into the site.

Speaker 2:          00:04:48       Give people. Yeah. It's, it's, it's there, isn't it? The other thing about it, which is quite fun, is you can take these kind of mystical rides into metaphor so you can symbolize things with 300, four elephants, which you can't do in some version of a realistic world. So it becomes. You have broad poetic license to take liberties are using CGI in this movie. A lot of it. Yeah. Wow. What's that like? I'm boring, but creative is three years. The bank, this movie I'm used to making movies that take three months to write, three years, three years. Wow. Three months to write from beginning to end. Southern lot snatch was three months, six weeks to shoot, two months to edit. So it's was three months to do the whole thing or to write it, to write it and to shoot it. The whole thing from the beginning to the way getting to the end of six months. Oh Wow. And then three months safer editing. So you wrapped and packed in nine months, 10 months.

Speaker 3:          00:05:53       So this is a totally different kind of commitment as far as your and

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       yeah, if I really knew what I was getting into, I would have asked for double bubble on the salary because you saw, I think it could be a year and a half is not a three years. Like when you play on a movie like this, a big epic movie. Do you have an actual schedule of when you think it's going to begin and when it's going to end or do you do, but you know the terrain filmmaking has changed exponentially. Like everything with technology. So what was pertinent last year is not pertinent in this year. So release dates are a real dog. So we had a release date which was projected a couple of years from when you start the babies. So get right is checkmate the movie you're coming out in? It was. We were supposed to come out and exactly a year ago, but then what happens is if you're not a branded movie, you get elbowed off that day.

Speaker 2:          00:06:51       You know, Star Wars or something will come along and then you don't get to compete without walls, so you got to move because you can't compete, so you got a very crowded market with lots of brands. Now this isn't something that we used to suffer because everyone was equal going into the equation. You give yourself the advantage of having a movie star or something, but that doesn't exist anymore. What exists now is the brand is the big brother, so he comes muscling and bullies his way into a weekend and that's why you can't really get new films breaking through because there was occupy those weekends are already occupied, so trying to break through is a real real struggle. We had to wait a year for a day and the date that were coming out on one weekend after guardians now got into be vast hit and it's very dangerous being within the parameters of a of a big movie.

Speaker 2:          00:07:44       That's a really interesting thing that only movies have to go through these days, right? I mean, it's one of the rare things where people are getting out and going to see something that's been made together in a group. You know that you're, you're watching media like it's not a live performance. It's something that's been created and it's going to press play at 8:00 PM on Friday night and everybody's going to go to see it and you got to get as many of those people together as you can. It's one of the rare things like that. Yeah, and it's becoming more polarized so it means more now, so you're opening weekend. Everything is about. They know what you're going to make by Thursday evening, right? You're coming. You're supposed to be coming out on Friday and everyone knows what you have to make. By Sunday night on a Thursday evening, there's enough clever people out there tapping into clever little boxes and computer says that, that the data, and they're seldom wrong now.

Speaker 2:          00:08:34       That never used to be the case. Used to come out and films will get discovered. You said platform, you start small, go big. That sort of nonsense. Now you just got to come out bold swinging, and if you don't come out ball swing and people get very upset and they think that this is a failure, it hasn't lived up to expectations, even if it's a creative success, nobody likes it. It's, well, you know, there's a bit of that, you know, there's, there is an accepted set, uh, movies, good movies, good movies find their own way, usually in the end anyway, but the financial aspect has become polarized. It's too significant of a component in the equation because, you know, it's an art form, right? At the end of the day, it's entertainment and an art form. And somehow you want to unify, reconcile that. So because they're essentially different, reconcile those, put it in a nice little package.

Speaker 2:          00:09:29       So you put it in a pill with a sweet wrapper around it and then you got both and then you should be happy. You should have the substance and you should have the flavor. Um, but then now the focus is all on the flavor and not in the substance. And that's result orientated. So you movie comes out and they go, what am I not slow down, son? What's the movie line? The question first of all should be what's the movie like rather than what did it mean? And it, it's just, it's become too competitive and to comparative financially and I love a dollar bill and I like things that successful, but it has to be secondary to what's primary and primary is. What's it like creatively?

Speaker 1:          00:10:11       Well, a film like, no, not to shit on it, but fast and furious. All I heard about was how much money you made. That's all you hear. It's like the big story, the big fast and the furious opening box office. Hundreds of millions of dollars. All you see is like, it's going to make a billion dollars. Why don't you give a fuck? Why does anybody who's watching that give a fuck? You're not gonna get any of that money. Why is it so appealing that this movie is made a billion dollars? Because it's comparative and it's competitive and it's why two people in the audience

Speaker 2:          00:10:39       because it's voyeuristic. Voyeuristic. Yeah. So you can. It's like spectator sport. Who's the winner? Right. You don't really care about how they won. You just care about the fact that they did when

Speaker 1:          00:10:52       or like a floyd mayweather. You want to find out how much money he made. He made $200,000,000 at five. Oo. People get excited about it. It's an extra element.

Speaker 2:          00:11:00       Yeah. There is a sort of, um, for carious life that people can have through sports stars, celebrities and success if they feel somehow related to or they went on the opening weekend or they are invested in that. If it's successful, then somehow proliferate. I'm successful. Yeah. That gets weird, right? It does get weird. Yeah. It's the

Speaker 1:          00:11:24       business of movies is a very, very strange business because you are a creative business, but you're also a business enterprise. I mean you're, you're a financial business and when know when it's a guy like you, like your movies have a certain flavor, you know, like you start off with lock stock and two smoking barrels. Like that movie has a flavor to it. And then your other films, like people want to go to see that kind of flavor from your film. Do you feel like pressure in that regard, like to live up to those expectations or to conform to these ideas people have of your movies?

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       Yes and no. Yes and no. It depends what mood you catch me in, right? Um, I like what I do and I'm going to do it anyway. I just liked it very much when people pay me to do it and give me the money to go do it. So I don't mind the financial aspect of it. I don't mind films having to compete. I what I'm, what I'm after is a reconciliation and as I say, the primary components, you'd be on the quality of the work. That should be what's primary, but I don't begrudge films being successful. I'd like them to be successful. I liked the competitive element, but sometimes when you're talking with executives, you realize my priorities are on the wrong thing here in the end it is a creative medium and that is what has to be primary. Do they get in the way of a guy like you though?

Speaker 2:          00:12:41       Like I would imagine the guy like you, they give you a certain amount of leeway, they give you all the leeway. That's beautiful. Yeah, and I, I, my experience with studios will be very positive and they tried to encourage your hopefully what is your individual idiosyncrasies? They want you to put your imprint upon the work and they've been nothing but encouraging in that sense, but you know, people betray their agendas whilst you're in light conversation or they portray their priorities. So you want to trust the man because he's a man of substance and to a degree, independence. So he's not looking to me to find himself through me. So you're not asking me to tell you who you are. And that's the ongoing battle of live, right? Where will asking other people to tell us who we are and independence from. That is a man that can be trusted.

Speaker 2:          00:13:35       I don't want anything from you and thereby I can be kind to you because I don't need to manipulate you. You're no longer a crutch, right? So it's got to be very difficult when you're in business. When someone like that, especially like an executive, some slick character in a fine suit to find out exactly what is real motives really are than never in find suits. Never, never. They dress in appalling suits. Really? Yeah. I mean business is never encourage. Find suits. The pocket squares, occasionally you find the token pocket square, but you can tell their heart's not in it. The wife stuck it in there because she's so someone on tv that Adam razzle dazzle about them and they thought, oh, I quite fancy model man wearing them and they stick it in. The old man's bit embarrassed about it and tries to squeeze out of the way. Suits are a thing. The death of the suit. It was the death of the suit. Was the attitude toward ongoing. No, no, go. Yeah, we'll put a tie on and I don't want us to cow. That's how I feel, but that's what's happened. We've been brainwashed to not dress line gentlemen, but I see a guy like you and I say that's appealing. Like look how you're dressed and you're in a conservative suit. This is a nice,

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       like I'm sure you could wear any suit you wanted, but you chose assert that has a certain look to it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:58       Yeah. I have spent some time asking around with this Joe, but a bit like that same reason that we spent time asking around with they'll pocket square. It's. I remember thinking how much I found the suit repugnant and I became angry that the suit had been robbed from us and so I had to create an alibi away in to understand why is that? I'd like a suit. This was the magic of Ralph and in the magic of Ralph Lauren, Nice Jewish boy from New York called Lipschitz, created a waspy empire is a wonderful expression that, you know, think Yiddish, dress British and Ralph Lauren created this great empire and resold the waspy world back to the waspy world. Oh, you actually not to the waspy world because in England there was a sort of resentment about savile row traditional tailoring because it'd been robbed from them. The officers that come along, the number crunchers that come along and there was no creativity in the suit. A suit needs to be creative. The person that puts it on can't be putting it on, but because he's told to put it on, he's got a one or put it on.

Speaker 3:          00:16:08       Uh Huh.

Speaker 2:          00:16:10       So what Ralph did is he fashioned up there sort of cause I new England world and salt. He, he took on a trope, he took on a cliche and he refashioned that cliche to give it a new sense of life, a new sense of breath. He'd put black people in. The suits were traditionally, it was just a white man's suit. He made it feel new. We gave it a take. So what he did is he tipped his hat, the old world, but also tipped his hat, the new world. And it allowed wasps to find their way back into the world with an eloquent narrative. It was clever.

Speaker 3:          00:16:44       Um, I'm getting fascinated by the way your brain works because for you it's important that the person wants to wear the suit. And I have a feeling that that's. So that's symbolic of how you feel about life itself. Like the person has to want to be doing what they're doing. They have to want to wear that suit. It has to be an authentic gesture. Um, did you ever read a book called extreme ownership written by a couple of navy seals? That's Jocko Willink, right? No, no. That's. I think it is. Is it your job was booked? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But Jack on the show a bunch of times. Important Book. Why I've got them on once before. What am I talking about a bunch of times. I've met him once, but it's an important book. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:17:22       Now there's lots of books that I've picked up on this theme, but they were very eloquent about it. If you don't own something, you're not the boss. You have to take full responsibility for everything that you do. Why be subservient? You must be the master of your own kingdom.

Speaker 2:          00:17:44       I feel you. It makes a lot of sense. You've got to own that. You can't just walk into things with your eyes half open. You will walk into things with your eyes fully open. You got to know what you're getting into. You have to take possession of your life. Is this a thought process that you have to constantly reaffirm or is this is exactly that. It's exactly that. You drift on this point and it is whatever form of meditation or Mantra that you decided to espouse the needs to be some period in your day where you remember that there's a world out there trying to tell you who you are and there's a world in here that's trying to tell you who you are. Now, where do you want to put your x? Because the world outside is very noisy and very tempting and as all the Razzmatazz as all the tents and, and all the glitter,

Speaker 2:          00:18:36       it's called the toys. But that's because you don't think you're enough in the first place. Uh, you don't think you're enough in the first place. The whole idea of the world to sell your staff is first of all, they have to make you feel bad about yourself. Less than in some way. And I didn't resent this system by the way. It is the system, but most of the expression about don't hate, don't hate the player, hate the game. Don't hate the game. Love the game because you're in it, mate, so own the game except the rules and move on into the rules so the world will try and tell you who you are and you have to tell yourself who you are and there's this ongoing battle and somehow that there needs to be a reconciliation between the two, but in the end you've got to have all the eggs in your basket. There's also an ongoing internal battle though, isn't there?

Speaker 3:          00:19:27       There's the you that you want people to think you are and there's the you who you are and trying to figure out like, how do I, how do I figure out who I am? I am I do I have a correct assumption of how the people are perceiving me and how I actually am objectively or am I bullshitting them world with this suit and pocket square?

Speaker 2:          00:19:49       Yeah. I would say that is exactly the scenario that we're talking about. The essentially one to two worlds is the inner world of energy in this email to weld of energy. This, those two identities, ones, real ones falls. The external world is. I'm asking you to tell me who I am. That's what we're all playing at, and as soon as you start playing that game, we run into all sorts of trouble, call it ego, call it whatever you want to call it, but that's the dynamic that we're in and somehow we have to

Speaker 2:          00:20:19       give ourselves enough confidence to reassure ourselves that we are enough. However, I enter the game because I've got to move on in the world. It got crack on in the world and I know there's loads temptations that come along the way, so I will own the suit. I'm going to wear the suit. I'm going to Wyoming. The soup now don't mean by paying for it. I mean by owning it, it's now mine suit. It's my idea to put on this suit. I have to personalize it in some way. I have to understand a narrative that allows me to own that suit and thereby I put on my suit of armor and I come out into the world and guess what? I'm in a good time because I'm owning the suit. Now. This is a very rock solid philosophy. Is this something you've ever written down? It's what the essence of narrative. I'm storyteller. The essence of narrative is only about this dynamic. There is nothing else in a story other than this dynamic, so the struggle between other people's perceptions and your own wants and desires and who you truly are, your your significant real self. That's it. That's all there is. You tell me a story that didn't, that we engaged in that famous. That's not about this journey. I'll give you an example. The political son

Speaker 2:          00:21:38       parable, Christian seems to religious doesn't really make much sense. You know this story? Sure, but why don't you lay it out? So there's a father, he has two sons and all of a sudden the youngest son, and he says to them who wants to spend their inheritance? The youngest has, has made that dog and spend it, and the younger son takes all the dough and he runs off and sniff coke off stripper's tits for a number of years until he realizes this is getting pretty boring and I'm in a lot of trouble. He ends up feeding, throwing food pics. That's his job and he couldn't even eat the food that he gives to the pics. At which point he says, Dad, will you take me back?

Speaker 2:          00:22:22       That then goes to, they don't meet. This somehow happens. Not through telephones. It just happens at which point that goes to the fatty carbs has killed the fatted calf. Older sons, his own dad. What's going on? I've stayed with you since the beginning. I've been loyal to you and I hear the stories of my younger brother coming back who's been sniffing coke off stripper's tits for the last God knows how many years and you're prepared. Kill the fatted calf. What's the spa that I want another story. This is your son. Don't worry about that. You take a little side step, little step to the side. You'll always be with me. You're a good boy. At which point he goes out to meet the product, the wasteful son, the waste some returns, and he says, you will also know you're found. That's the end of the story is quite hard to make sense of that. In a literal sense. You Go, Oh, dad was a bit unfair. You should have been unkind to the oldest son because he never ran off and did anything, but the essence of the story is that you are the father. You are enough. Your oldest son is your intellect. He says, oh, danger. There's danger that is trying to reconcile, makes sense of a present and material world. The younger son being the wild feral entity that is wants to go out and find out what it's all about,

Speaker 2:          00:23:49       so when his recklessness and sense of adventure, he finds that he can't escape himself,

Speaker 2:          00:23:58       so we have to return to himself and at which point he has to accept who he is, which button the intellect is left out. The equation pretty much is the older brother because he can't understand the significance of the journey of the wasteful brother. Any end, you have to leave yourself to understand the value of yourself. You have to lose stuff before you realize that all the stuff that you're losing is a femoral and transitory. It's not yours. You are enough. You are always enough, but you've got to somehow prostitute yourself before you realized you were in value. That is the essence of all stories. That's deep guy. Richie, is that something you think about all the time or is this. I mean this is like a segmented philosophy lip, so king off stock you just made a man is a king. As a son, the son, the father is runs into a bit of aggro.

Speaker 2:          00:24:56       The son jumps into a little boat, a little skillet, and he's not scale it. That's what you got your chops on, isn't it? A skiff. Little skiff. The skiff takes off down the river. He gets found by prostitutes. He's bought up in a brothel. He understands the ways that the street, he becomes a king on the street. He works his way out that different ladders and then he pulls a soul from a stone at a certain point in his life, certain point of evolution, and then from there he goes on to be the king as a bit of a tussle over along the way, lots of wrestling matches in the endophyte, his demons, and he becomes the king. So what's the significance of this narrative? That every man and himself is irs socratic, that he is his own king. He takes the sojourn into the material world, has climb up all the different runs on the ladder and ultimately has to return to himself.

Speaker 2:          00:25:44       The significance of the extraction from the sword, from the stone is the stone is the material world, the material world, which seems all solid because it controls you whilst you're projecting your sense of identity upon it. The extraction of the stone is taking back your own authority. You're Rhone divinity around authority, around identity, whatever it is that you've got to call it your own power. You will no longer looking for a sense of self outside of yourself and then you have to face the demons that you've created and your history by facing them and fighting them and owning them. You put them in the face of who you are and that's a wrestling match. You'd have to take away all these crutches and that's all that we struggled from in life is taken away, are crutches. Oh, please tell me who I am. Oh, please give me a bit more money so the people think I'm clever or when they're not.

Speaker 2:          00:26:34       Have a nice cut horn. People think I'm clever. You got to take away all these crutches and stand as the man that you are and you're liberated from your whole thing. That is the story of King Arthur, but it's not just the story of King Arthur. It's the story of all narrative. Do you think that most people that are watching the film, we're going to get that though. They're just going to get an entertaining story. They're just going to see a bunch of cool stuff, some drama play out, but this is fascinating that you're operating so many levels underneath it. He bought him a storyteller on business, so if I'm in the business of store, I might as well understand story and do you need to understand a lot? I'm not sure if you do. Depends where you on the ladder so you can just go along.

Speaker 2:          00:27:09       I have a nice bit of entertainment, good guy, bad guy. Everything is literal. There's nothing wrong with literalism. It is what it is. It's the game you can glean what you can glean when you're ready to glean what you're ready to glean or you Joseph Campbell Fan. I am a Joseph Campbell Fan. Yeah, yeah. That, I mean, that's a reoccurring theme in his work, the hero's journey, the hero's journey, these underlying sort of narrative that just really guides all, all stories and all ancient tales and that there's something inherently human about them important about these stories and they resonate with our wants and needs and goals and even also maybe the structure that we really truly need in our own life. Yeah. I mean all the stories from whatever period. I'm sympathetic to this particular, um, to Joseph Campbell's philosophy on this, but he's not the only one. Right. The weird thing about religion is religion has done to this spiritual significance of narrative. Well, the businessman did to the suit.

Speaker 2:          00:28:12       He's literalized it. He didn't realize that putting on a suit is putting on a suit. Obama, he's putting on something that's rather spectacular. It's just doing it for convention you're doing for others. You're not doing it for you. And in all literal mind, we look at a narrative and we see the narrative for what we believe it to be, the exterior aspect of the narrative. So we completely, we see the world upside down. We don't. We're not actually interested in the essence of the narrative because we're so busy pandering after the approval of others. So everything that we see, every narrative that we listened to, every film that you say, you're not really interested in its soul, you're interested in it's body because that's what we correspond to. It's fascinating that you're comparing it to suits because it resonates. Like when you think of a guy showing up for work or getting ready for work and he doesn't want to go and he's putting on the suit and it's just dredging through it and putting it on and or you think about a guy who was crisply tucking in his collars and putting on his cuff links and tightening up his tie and he feels empowered by the whole process of it.

Speaker 2:          00:29:25       It's very. It's very appealing. They're like, have you seen in a film too? It's very exciting. This is a man of purpose. They didn't mean streets, I don't know. You remember harvey cartel and getting dressed to go up on a Friday, getting dressed to go out Friday night and it affected a whole generation of people about the way they dress because he, it. Yeah. I never really thought about that until this conversation because I just, I don't really wear suits occasionally. Very, very occasionally. But you'd been robbed. I've been robbed. You've been world. There are so many aspects of life. Food for a long time got robbed from us and we've slowly managed to claw that back. It's true. Um, but clothes really. You're a 45 year old geezer and you still dressing like an 18 year old cast is all about. Well, some people like to be comfortable though.

Speaker 2:          00:30:13       I get that by the way. And they liked that look. Comfortable. Your students comfortable. It's comfortable. You can get pulled into this completely deconstructed on the inside maybe by a chap called Brunello, knows what he's doing. So these are all handmade. Um, so it won't be handmade, tailored a. no, I bought this off the shelf and I had a couple of things tweet, but it's as comfortable as a pair of pajamas. Really? Yeah. See again, you have to broker a deal. You can't put on things that are uncomfortable because guess what happens in the morning? You're looking through your suit. You'd go, oh, I like that one. One with a comfortable one, so they all have to be comfortable while otherwise you don't get to play the game. Here. I have a thing about ties though. Go on, I'd kill someone with a tie on for sure. You can kill some 100 percent if I get ahold of that. Tie Your Dead Joe is conversation needs to go on for longer.

Speaker 2:          00:31:06       Zip ties. You're wearing a rope around your neck. If someone just gets a deep grab. Joe, what are you thinking about? Twist. I'm not going to have a fight with anyone, but it's. I mean you would have to in a deep disagreement. You'd have to wrestle that sucker loose and take it off to be safe. I'm not going to indulge this, shouldn't you? Should. That's my own personal problem. I just feel like someone with a tie on, all you have to do is grab that thing and that's a wrap. Like if you went into a Jujitsu match and you had a rope around your neck, your Jujitsu practitioner, right? I am, yeah. So don't you've. I'm sure you've been colored choke then. Yeah. Yup. In Fun for 20 years. Twenty years thing around your neck. Like really by the way money game is. I'm all about the gay.

Speaker 2:          00:31:54       I mean, yeah, I played a lot known gay, but I've come back to the gay and the reason I've come back to the gate is I can quite tasty with the gay. So tasty contests with a gay icon as a couple moves. I like to show it's a bit tricky on the, on your with your t shirt, but I'm all about strategy man with his gay. Um, which somehow elegantly segues from the tie. I mean I'm all about creating what I call the hangman's rope out of the bottom of your gay. Turning that into a thing. So you're one of those guys that pull the bottom of that canyon, wraps up. I'm that guy out there and I played this game for a long time, which is the wrapping around the wrist or you know, the, at the eeg. So you

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       get that little dinosaur flippy there, so your arms out of action. But then I discovered something, Joe, if you slipped back in through there. So what he's doing for people just listening, he's talking like towards is on the inside, inside crack of his elbow and once it comes in the inside

Speaker 2:          00:32:56       you can't get that hand out again. That's it. Basically the font server from the,

Speaker 1:          00:33:01       the fights over from there because from then on you Umm, the um. Hm. That's interesting. We should have a little roller on it. Yeah. This job. How long have you been trained? In? Twenty years. What about 20 years from Enza. Oh, that's legit man. That's seriously legit. Do you think most people know that you've managed to keep that on the dl? A little bit? Not so much. Not so much, no. Well, I think if you asked the average person the street, this Guy Ritchie a black belt in Jujitsu, they go, no, but just the average man in the street, no black belt in Jujitsu is anyway. I think they do now more than ever. Yeah, probably more now. Well, that's why when I see a guy that's experienced as you were in a tie, I go, hmm. Maybe just super confident about no one being able to get to that time.

Speaker 1:          00:33:45       Joe was scaring off. Well, I'm a ridiculous person. That's what's going on. I mean, you have your own ridiculous ideas about owning suits. I have my ideas. Ideas about getting choked to death, wearing a tie. Like I said, I'm not going to indulge your fishing. I love fishing. I'm honestly, I do. I really do have an issue with ties. Okay. But it looks wonderful on you. Thank you very much. I mean, for real, it's very elegant appearance, the whole thing from the top to the bottom. When did you start training a under who were like, where were you?

Speaker 2:          00:34:15       Um, first of all, I did karate for 15 years. I did shut a it, which I was obsessed with. Go second down in that. And then acl went twice on the right leg and I watched choke. Can you remember chuck? Sure. And I want to choke. And that was a, it was a revelation because old man, what was his mother? Julio, Elio, Elio, Elio Element. India was on the map it for in that video I thought, well, I'm not getting any younger and if I'm going to take up a martial art, I love fighting. So I'm very happy to talk about funding for a long time. I'm a fancy the idea that because if I stayed with karate I realized I would not be on the mat at 84. So, and back then there was no Jujitsu in London. That was judo and they had what was called the Waza, which is the ground game and they're pretty tasty.

Speaker 2:          00:35:08       We got some good judo players. Um, so I went from crotty to judo, but I was only interested in the ground game. And then Roger Gracie came to live in the UK about 20 years ago. And Roger Gracie went onto become the world champion eight times and I started taking lessons with him and his Dad Maricio. Then I ended up in New York for, I think we lived. I lived in New York for awhile. My ex wife and I went to the Zos gym when it was above the Methadone clinic and I fell in love with pencil and I fell in love with Jujitsu in a sort of serious way. And I became obsessed with it for a number of years. Hence I get me a lot belts.

Speaker 4:          00:35:51       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:35:53       I mean I should've got black belt 10. Well, I say I should've got a black belt. I was, I was, I became lazy to a degree. So I've got a black belt when I should've got a black belt. And as you and I know there's some tasty blue belts out there, can I have a lot of fun with me? Um, but I sort of drifted a bit. I came in and out, sustained a few injuries, but if I was training hard, you train hard, you get black pound five years on you,

Speaker 1:          00:36:17       you got to be obsessed with kids. Oh, the kids are. You can. I mean, I was a brown belt for eight years, so he talked to them and I know that I'm the same as you. I was praying about for eight years. I think it's a. If you're a real fanatic, you could get it in five years, but it's super rare. Like Bj Penn got it in three. That's almost unheard of. There's a few people that

Speaker 2:          00:36:37       done that. Yeah. There's some guys in our gym in London in Roger's place that they're there five days a week, three hours a day. They mean it and within six months they're at proper pain in the ass.

Speaker 1:          00:36:49       Yeah. Yeah. Well, once you become obsessed with the movements and you start studying the various positions and the possibilities, it becomes a part of your life, becomes a part of your. Almost like your your operating system and as you see these guys reinforce that operating system, you see their, their game becoming more and more complex and the beetle, that chain attack after attack and being able to anticipate the defenses of those attacks and plan two and three steps ahead and you see all this play out. It's an uh, may I, I really, really enjoy watching someone go from being a beginning student to being a killer. It's a fascinating process because you are literally watching someone develop their comprehension of a language of fighting and that language of fighting is analogous to life. It helps them in every single aspect of their life because it's one of the most difficult things that a person will do in their day.

Speaker 1:          00:37:36       When you walk into a Jujitsu school, you're, you park your car, you live in this normal realm of normal people with normal problems and bills and stresses and issues. But once you go into that thing, he put on that Gi or no gi or whatever you're doing and you'd go into that class. Once you engage in these sparring sessions, he's sparring sessions with skilled practitioners. You're doing one of the most difficult things. Any person within a hundred mile radius of you that's not fighting for their life is doing, and by doing that on a regular basis and constantly reinforcing this language, it enhances the all your possibilities and your potential possibilities as a person.

Speaker 2:          00:38:17       Very eloquent comment. Couldn't, couldn't agree with you more. One of the great things I found about Jujitsu is whenever I came to a city, we just tap into a computer where the next Jim was and we wrote down there. I usually, I'm usually with two or three people and I've been out there. He's also a black belt. Um, uh, got a chaplet. Uh, I was with called bobby the tits, who was an Olympic judo player. I can usually say the chest on this gaze. At least that's why I'm so across through and Ivan the terrible and bobby the tits. We used to hit these gyms and uh, everyone, there's a guest complete substructure thereof. If you want to be looked after, they'll give you a gap fellow mate as it going into the Brotherhood. I suppose it's probably the same for people. Go to church, I don't know, but there is a brotherhood that I found amongst fighters where everyone's like game and friendly come around at the barbecue and everyone's as whole sub structure there that everyone will look after everyone else and I've never in the 20 years of fighting in different gyms have I lost my temper or I had a reason to lose my temper.

Speaker 2:          00:39:20       Is anyone ever been a bully? If people a bit clumsy got bit carried away, but there's such a system of accountancy that you can't get away with being a bully because there's always a bigger bullying and you know you're going to get found out and I liked that aspect of it. Everyone gets found out. Yeah. Especially over time. Right? I mean if you're training consistently with really difficult trading partners, your characters going to be tested. There's just nowhere. There's nothing. There's no way around it. And sometimes I ended up training quite a lot in at home. Right? I got five, six mates to come around there. It's not the same as going to a new gym with new players. Um, and you've got to get out there. I know a few rich guys that have got trainers and they not bad players, you know, the train is good and the is a good, but because they don't get outside of their comfort zone and go to a federal jim, Jim on the street there that it's very hard for them to really evolve.

Speaker 2:          00:40:17       Right? You got to keep putting yourself in an uncomfortable spot in uncomfortable gyms and like, as you said, when you do that though, you do see the kind of the same thing over and over again. The same type of human, you know, you just see them in London or you see them in New York or Los Angeles. You see that same type of human. It's the great thing about a sport in general, but let's be specific because it's something that you and I can relate to is there are no barriers in Jujitsu. No one's looking at you. If you're poor, you're black, you're white. It's completely irrelevant. You come to the mat and if you get on with the gays, you fight, you get on with the gaze that you fighting. Yeah, and there's a complete clarity of vision when you fighting so much, just finding them and then you rate them on their ability of how they fight.

Speaker 2:          00:40:59       Yeah, and you carry that social hierarchy, like what the wood. What's important in that school is that it is like who is proficient? Who is very good that that's the best currency. The ultimate currency. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I had a name when I used to train out here or in New York that they used to call me Hollywood because I was young. You said Liberty it person that you come in and say, oh, well I only. What'd you find that it roll around? But that, you know, in a couple of people initially went, oh yeah, that gazer and that lasted all of 30 seconds and then everything gets washed. Can you have no currency on the map other than your currency on the mat? And there's a wonderful clarity in that.

Speaker 3:          00:41:40       Yeah. For a guy like you or any any big time celebrity, that's probably one of the only few places where you really truly experienced that, like there's no bullshit in that role, like in someone's going after you and you're going after them. It's 100 percent. It is what it is. There's, there's all the. The, the bullshit veil of society has been removed.

Speaker 2:          00:42:00       Yeah, I mean on Monday the water a bit now. So harking back to what we were talking about previously, I'm aware that you become less adventurous as your ego grows in Jujitsu. Right? Particularly with the guy that doesn't tap tap. You don't ever want to be the guy that doesn't tap and you hung up when you become a boring fighter and it's an issue. You know those guys. There's a couple of guys that I can think of. One in particular that if you get the better of him and by and large is better than me, but all of a sudden you realize is in trouble just before I'm about to tap. And he goes, oh, stop that. Once I go. If you just moved a little bit to the instruction, those guys, that's their alibi to get out them losing face, so what phase is it they're losing is the crutch that they actually think that being a Jujitsu player has an identity in itself and it doesn't.

Speaker 2:          00:42:57       You cannot use it as a crutch and that's the essence of all martial arts. Martial arts was about find yourself within that framework and be honest about it and you meet the opponent and his condo will tell you you're finding it's about you fighting you in the ring. What your other part of the mind to the other bottom on that we were talking about once I say it's about your reputation in the gym and what people think of it. Again, you're trying to find an identity from outside of yourself by not tapping and you know that feeling and by the way I suffered myself because I didn't like to tap either, but it. It makes my game. It inhibits my game and it stops me. Being creative.

Speaker 3:          00:43:38       Marcella Garcia has always been very adamant about that, that you have to open up your game in the gym and it's the only way to really truly progress and don't worry about being tapped and don't have that ego and there's a great video of him and Damien Maia Rolling and they're rolling. They have like they're putting almost no like kinetic strength, no explosive energy, nothing, no, nothing athletic. They're just going through the movements and exchanging positions and they're tapping each other left and right and left and right with no ego. It's really interesting to watch because you see like Marcello Catch Damien and they brought to a position and Damien taps and then they go through another position and Marcello does it and it's just. It's really fascinating because when they're doing they're truly flowing. There's no like real, oh here we go right there. You can see them do it, but like when these guys would do it, like as they're doing it, they're obviously using strength and they're countering with skill, but everything is very smooth

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       and controlled and you're looking at two of the very best black belts to ever do it. You're looking at Damien Maia, who right now is arguably the top contender in the UFC welterweight division. He's going to be fighting Jorge Mas Vidar next weekend actually, which is a really intense fight because monster killer and then Marcello Garcia, who's probably one of the all time great strangulation experts has ever walked the face of the planet. I mean, he's really revolutionized a lot of aspects of the good team, the rear naked choke and I was in Brazil, in Sao Paulo in 2003 when he burst onto the scene when he choked out. Chao Lin. And uh, to see these two guys rolling together is really, really interesting because this is really kind of how you have to do it. You just do it. You know, there's, there's no one is saying, I can't tap, I can't.

Speaker 1:          00:45:22       No, I can't put myself in a bad position there. They're exchanging positions to like right there. When Damian gets under hooks and these goes for the deep half, Marcel was just rolling with it. They're just flowing. Yeah, but you need two to tango. You can't have one with an ego and who's not going to play the game and bunkers down and screws himself down. It makes the whole thing very hard to do. It's got to be. You both got to be complicit. Yup. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, it's very, it's very interesting watching like to really, really high level guys like this role or like you know, hydro Gracie and Braulio a steamer or something like that. England's got a great scene and there's so much top level Jujitsu over in England right now. It's go some good players. Yeah. He used to be a time just a couple of decades ago where if you wanted to train, it was very difficult to find really proficient instruction and groups training part 20 years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:46:12       It wasn't possible. I remember because I was first into it when we made snatch, which is 18 years ago, and that's when, how'd you first came to town? And before then it was just you to just in the Waza yeah. Well, I mean you can certainly get something out of that, but um, it seems like the level of A. I mean there's some people that have just one rock solid attack, like Rhonda Rousey at that rock solid attack with the arm bar and she comes from that judo background. That's a Jambo. Oh, it's nasty. Her arm bar to this day I believe is one of the best arm bars I've ever seen in mma. Not just because, uh, she's successful with it. But when you watch her transitions, you watch how she's able to adjust and change. And like the cat Zingano fight is a perfect example of that.

Speaker 1:          00:46:55       Cat Zingano just charges out or like a fucking bat out of hell. And they have this mad scramble and Rhonda realizes a position that she's, she doesn't even utilize, but she's, she understands armbar so well. She knows what. I could just throw my hip over this way and kick back here and I'll catch that arm bar. This is just overall understanding of the position is so high level. Yeah. When someone has a movement, but I used to find a bit with a Hickson and Hixon use that thing where he ties his hands behind his back and you try and do something to it and you can't do anything to

Speaker 2:          00:47:31       the level of sophistication when it's like that. He's so. He, so technical hixon that it was. Well, what I understand about Jujitsu is really rather primitive. Um, but I'm aware I'm primitive and I'm aware that my understanding of Jujitsu is really quite primitive. And then when you see something like that arm bar come sneaking out of nowhere always said that. It's a magnificent thing to behold, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. The when and what you're saying is kind of interesting because that was listening to this and go, how has a black belt primitive? What do you not primitive? You're an expert, but I understand totally because I'm also primitive. I know, I know what I know. Like I understand like there's what, what Hickson's languages is a series of words that you've never heard before, spoken perfectly in the right order with no pauses or ums or no filler and the way he flows with it, it's just, he's got a level of proficiency that very few other than Marcello and Damien Maia can really appreciate the, the true beauty of it all because they just don't like, I won't, I won't see things coming. It will be there. They're too complex as it's completely different language. Yeah. Yeah. But you know enough. I'm already good lines on my, the other day that someone had enough brains to know that they didn't have any brains. Um, so you know enough to know that you're in treacherous in deep waters here. Yeah. Otherwise, your average gazes styles, styles running around with one of these good guys. Bad guys, jovial guy. There'll be the same. They got the same color belt on it. Let's have a go with that. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:49:16       Yeah. You just get manhandled now. Um, you said you had your knee fixed, you a blue. Would you blow out an acl acl? Done it twice. Yeah. Did you get um, cadaver replacement or no? Hamstring. And then Patella hamstrings, patella second to task stream blew out, right? Yeah. Those things blow out a lot. Uh, yeah. Eventually gave in. I had the first one that was about 21. Okay. And then the second one down was about 31 and it was held together, but they own needs a bit knackered. Do you know about stem? So yeah. How are you feeling about the great. I was that close to shoulder surgery and I had some placental stem cells shot into my shoulder and it's amazing. And where did you have that done? Vegas. Really? Yeah. There's a guy named Dr Rodney Mcgee was at the tip of the spear when it comes to the technology that's involved today, what was the issue? And to show the punch of tears, just stuff, just years and years of abuse at my cartilage is gone on the shoulder now. My college has gone on the knee and I didn't really know anything about stem cell about two weeks ago. And now that's what I'm hearing about. Oh, well I have a podcast. I'll send you and it was me and Dr Rhonda Magee that we did about a month ago. Fabulous. He's amazing and again he's. He's well up to date with the latest technology and he's also very conservative in his approach to it,

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       but what he's saying is that they are able to regenerate cartilage and meniscus tissue and this is the first time anything has ever come along that actually regenerates these tissue. They've been able to trim it and do things to it to mitigate pain, but now they can literally regenerate tissue there. Even injecting it into people's discs. Now the discs in the spine and they're showing that they can regrow disc tissue yet, but you've just nailed my three issues. This issue and cartilage. Yeah, that's the only issue is of course meniscus and cartilage and disk and what have you got going on with your back is the traditional issue with those three c, whatever the ankles at the bottom of the bag. I'm going to show you something else that you're gonna need and you're going to get after we have this conversation. I have a machine out back called the reverse hyper and it was created by this mad genius named Louie Simmons and what the reverse hypers and machine that decompresses your back and also strengthens at the same time.

Speaker 1:          00:51:25       It decompresses it on the downswing and then on the upswing it, it strengthens all those muscles around it, but it literally pulls the back apart and the compressed discs, which is bad posture, load a generation. You can look up at the screen. This is, this guy's fucking crazy. He's one of the craziest people I've ever interviewed who was hilarious, but he's a old time power lifter has been doing it forever. I mean he's got fake shoulders, fake knees. Everything's blown out. He has no biceps. Biceps are completely severed off of his arm. He. What was he saying like He. He was, he had his friends were making a Max out bench like five days after his shoulder replacement. He's a fucking maniac, but they were trying to fuse his discs and so he came up with this machine and you see as it swings down, when she's swinging down, it's pulling her back apart, like go to the.

Speaker 1:          00:52:15       Here you go. When it's going down, it's pulling the back, an active decompression and as she's swinging up, she's strengthening all those muscles in the spine in a real weird way where you really can't get at them. And was it. This is the efficient because you can do the suit might superficially I'm struggling there, but the coal underneath the superficial muscles to had the MRI. You could see all the fat in the surrounding muscle, a muscle around the discs and you could see the fat in it and then as soon as you hit the superficial, you went, oh, that's fun. There's nothing wrong with the superficial, so it's a need away. A lot this year. Just buy one of those men were you have to beast through. You'll superficial muscles to get to your colon muscles. Well, it's just it. It forces that area of the body to work like you're sustaining a load and you can you lift it up and you hold it in that position and then as you let it go, it's, it's decompressing and in the decompressed cycle you, you, you're feeling your muscles relaxed and you can actually feel it pulling like you feel in the lower back in a weird way.

Speaker 1:          00:53:21       You feel it kind of polling and separating and then a couple of seconds later you're and again, and then you pull the and separated and you're strengthened again, and then I have another thing out back that I bend over from the waist on and it allows my lower back to just completely relax and my upper body pulls down on my lower body and it separates and decompresses the lower spine. I mean, it's been tremendous. A huge, huge asset, but there's a bunch of things they can do. Now. If you heard a Regena cane, do you know what that is? No. Regena. Kina is something that was developed in Germany that a lot of professional athletes like coby Brian Mann and they went over there and it's a blood spinning procedures similar to platelet rich plasma, but they take the blood and as they're spinning it, they heated it up and when they heat it up, the blood has a reaction to the extreme heat like it thinks you have a fever, so it produces is very intense anti inflammatory response.

Speaker 1:          00:54:15       Obviously if you're a scientist or a doctor, I'm butchering this, but then they take this yellow serum which is this an anti inflammatory response and they can inject it into all these areas that you have massive inflammation like bulging discs and it has incredible effect. Had incredible effect for Peyton Manning, allowed them to get back to football again. I had a bulging disc that was making my hands go numb. Totally went away through decompression and through this kind of stuff. Yeah, I heard this added 10 years to Kobe's career. Am I thinking? Yeah, that's what he thinks. Yeah, she didn't. I didn't up until I'm 48, [inaudible] 49, almost 50. Oh, so I didn't think about any of these things until this year, so I accepted a acl, has bit of a nuisance

Speaker 2:          00:54:57       except the garb of a creaky bank. But in the last month I went to my, something happened to my knee and I went to the doctor a little a x ray and he went, well, it cut up right for the 10th time I've had an operation on that knee, but you better off now waiting of waiting for what to like if you knew what a canal. So he's talking about a replacement. So you're talking about replacement now he's saying just hold on. Right? So you're saying in 15 years from now or whatever it is. But it all changed. And then a month after I went and had the shoulder, um, x, right. And he looked at it and went, well, it could operate under, knew where we would go in here. You better apply until I give you a new one. Um, now that Giza were

Speaker 1:          00:55:47       talking about fixing, told you about giving me new ones right now I hadn't. So you know, Ivan out there knows exactly what you're talking about. To me the word, he wasn't a vessel to receive this information. Now in the last month I'm ready to receive this information. So in the next three months I will know of what you talk about immediately. I'm going to connect you with Dr Rodney Mcgee. As soon as we get off the phone or off the podcast here, I'm going to connect you with them and he'll, he'll be able to keep you abreast of all the stuff. And it changes constantly. Like when I first went, I first got a shot in July of last year

Speaker 3:          00:56:25       and I was that close to surgery. I was trying to figure, okay, I was planning my time. I was saying, okay, if I get the surgery I essentially can't use this arm for at least a few weeks and it's going to be pretty weak for at least three months. And I was really accepting that and he said, well let's just give this a shot. And within a couple of weeks of getting the shot, I was like, God damn, this thing feels better than it's ever felt before. And so through a series of exercises, like a lot of rotator cuff strengthening exercises and I'm a bottoms up kettle bells like where you. You have to stabilize the kettlebells ones. Those are those. Those are fantastic for stabilization muscles. And then it also made me realize that if you're going to do something along the lines of Jujitsu, something, it's very physically demanding. You have to strengthen your machine. I can't. You can't just keep going to Jujitsu, which is what I was doing for years. Me Too. That was my exercise. I don't think that's adequate. I think you have to strengthen the machine and I think yoga is also a really big and important part of strengthening that machine because it's lengthening, decompressing the spine and it's making you strong in these static positions, which is very similar to the load that's going to be pushed on those joints. And on your back when you're doing job

Speaker 2:          00:57:36       to a traunch, you go for a year. I tried every day because usually I can get into anything at some point or another. You've got to keep throwing enough hours at it. The one thing I couldn't get into couldn't do it. Maybe my approach was wrong. I was doing the [inaudible], my ex wife, and it was incredibly painful, incredibly challenging, but while on come out and fight is competitive element of it, there's my enemy. I can have a role around. With Miami, there's a tap, there's winners and losers, and for some reason that keeps me motivated. The idea, I mean in essence, I imagine it's the what I was talking about in the end, it's, it's self again, self. With Yoga, I just haven't made it that far to access that struggle and enjoy it. I feel like I'm always running on fumes and yoga.

Speaker 3:          00:58:23       Yeah, well you got to run on fumes, but it's. It's building a house, one layer of paint at a time. I mean it's. It's not a, it's not an easy thing to do and I think that competitive element that you're talking about is an internal struggle and that internal struggle is you and your breath. Keeping your breath and calm and check and focusing entirely on your breath while managing the positions and then slowly but surely developing more proficiency in those positions. More range of motion, more dexterity, keep going over and over again and then one day you get to a point. For me it was like maybe a year and a half into doing it pretty regularly while I'm like, okay, now I can finally hold this position for 30 seconds. Whereas before I would literally count to 10 and just try to get to 10 and then I'd fall down and then I get back up and try again.

Speaker 3:          00:59:13       Try to get to 10 and try to get my feet would buckle, my knee wouldn't be locked out and then I'd try again. Once you develop a certain of proficiency, then you can concentrate entirely on the breath and that's where the real struggle is. And then keeping the mind on track. Not Thinking about other bullshit. Now thinking about the just just the struggle of life and all the different variables that you have to deal with on a daily basis. Thinking only of the breath, the posture and the breath, very difficult to keep on track so that invariant, that's the competitive struggle. It's in your home.

Speaker 2:          00:59:46       See a consistency with the theme though. That theme is this, that that's all there is, is the outside world of the noise and what comes with that and there's the internal self, but everything is. Everything is subject to these rules and yoga in this sense is no difference. Jujitsu's no different narrative is no different. It's being aware of what the dynamic is. It's being aware of what's actually going on. That I think is fundamental. Yes, yes. I'm pattern recognition. Recognizing that it's the same for yoga is for the essence of a narrative. Absolutely.

Speaker 3:          01:00:22       Yeah, and those things become a vehicle for developing your human potential, whether it's yoga or whether it's Jujitsu and I think pattern recognition. It's they take place in bold things in yoga. You Go, okay, I've been here before, I know where this is, I know I know what to do, and you go right back into that thing of concentrating on controlling the breath. These big long, deep breaths and these big long exhales and then the focus is entirely on the breath and those patterns, they come up in Jujitsu as well that that ability to maintain breath. I mean, I'm sure you've recognized that in a person who just starts, like one of the things you see about someone who's just starting, even if they're athletic, they don't know what they're doing. They started hyperventilating. They don't know what to do. They start breathing weird and they. The breath is like the first thing that you lose control over and Hickson from the movie choke. I mean that was the big thing that separated Hickson from all the other Jujitsu players is yoga.

Speaker 2:          01:01:12       Yeah. His Yoga. He made yoga sexy.

Speaker 3:          01:01:15       Yeah. Yeah. He, well, he was the first guy to make it appealing at all to martial artists. I mean, that was with your wife did. That's what your mom does. It's what the housewives do. It's not something that a man does, especially not the top Jujitsu killer ever.

Speaker 2:          01:01:30       It was a seminal. It was a seminal documentary that changed a lot of people's lives and it sort of turned hixon into a rockstar.

Speaker 3:          01:01:37       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I've had him in here. He's an. He's an amazing guy to talk to. I've had him. I've talked to him several times, but having him in here and sitting down with him and talking to him about Jujitsu, it's like, it's like the. It's like sitting down with Michelangelo and talking about art. I mean you're talking about there's masters and then there's the master of the masters and if you talk to any Jujitsu master, they all just go. Hixon is the number one thing. There's no dispute, which is amazing. There's very few, like there's soccer players that are just elite and there's basketball players that are elite, but when it comes to like who's the best in Jujitsu, there was always this one and while

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       he was competitive and especially while he was young, it was always Hixon, which is to me amazing that he was able to maintain. And I think one of the things about him was his physicality and his mind and I think those two things in many ways were enhanced by yoga. I think he's got some disc issues now that it doesn't. It has quite a few. He has quite a few. Yeah, I think he has eight bulging discs, which is horrific. Maybe you should send him to your mind. Oh, I'm going to 100 percent. I mean, I've talked to him about a bunch of things. Hixon those are a bit reluctant for certain kinds of treatment, you know, I mean, he's a, he's just gonna eat mangoes and fucking meditate and Shit. I Dunno, I dunno what he's, uh, what is, uh, what he's tried or what he's willing to try.

Speaker 1:          01:03:04       But I would love to see him. I mean, I would love to see him rolling again. I mean, that would be amazing if they could regenerate this tissue to the point where he would be healthy. I mean, that's the fear. The fear for the first time for me is that I've never felt any version of age on the mat. But when people are starting to tell me, oh, we're not going to fix it, we're gonna wait until we give you a new one. Okay. What side of the this night and when they're saying that about your knee, what is the issue? Is that a meniscus issue? Um, it is a meniscus issue, but I've lost 75 percent of the meniscus of the cartilage. I get confused between the difference cartilage or meniscus. What is the different cartilage is what covers the outside of the bone? Meniscus has the padding essentially that's in between the two bones that keeps them from touching each other.

Speaker 1:          01:03:49       Right. Okay. So they have both. So it goes bone, meniscus, cartilage, cartilage, meniscus, the Meniscus, you can cut some of it out. But when you didn't have had that done, um, my left knee, they, they did, uh, you know, they go in arthroscopically and they trim some of the torn meniscus. Yeah, it's, it's, it works. But if it's less stable, there's less tissue in there. It's more subject to inflammation and swelling. It doesn't handle the load as well. But I got stem cell shot into there and I've never had a problem since. It's amazing. I had a problem with it for. I mean I tore it for the first time a more than 20 years ago and had an operation I think in [inaudible] 95, somewhere around there and then I had another operation on it in 2001, 2002 and it was. It's always been an issue since then.

Speaker 1:          01:04:41       It's just one of those things that he gets sore. I just deal with it. Whether it's kickboxing or whether it's lifting weights or whether it's Jujitsu, it gets sore. I just deal with it. I take glucosamine and Chondroitin and a lot of fish oil and antiinflammatories and changing. My Diet helped quite a bit, but there was always that thing until they shot the stem cells in there and then literally within a few months it's nonexistent. Like I don't think I have this need that acts up anymore. Now I have a knee that never acts up. It just doesn't bother me anymore. This is very exciting stuff. It's very exciting stuff. And Tell me how thin I'm on the wedge in terms of

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       this being new. Well, they've been doing it and experimenting with it for a couple of decades apparently according to Dr Mcgee, but the understanding of the potential and the possibilities and then the practical application as over the last 10 years has really come to the forefront. It's really become something very, very viable. It's not just theoretical anymore. Now they're actually seeing people regenerating tissue. They're seeing people where you have a tear in your shoulder or something like that and then go out and you're probably going to have to get surgery. No. Then they shoot it in there and then next thing you know it a couple months later, I mean I still got some floating tissue that like pops and crunches and stuff and my shoulder. But when it comes to like the actual strength in my shoulder, I don't worry about it at all. Like it doesn't bother me.

Speaker 3:          01:06:01       I mean there's, there's occasionally some light soreness, but as far as like the functional strength of the shoulder, it's like 100 percent. It's crazy. So is this the thin end of the wage then? So is this gonna, is this gonna turn into one of those exponential? It is. Oh, for sure. For sure. They're already generating. They. They built this woman. This is very exciting. It's tough. It's as exciting as it gets. The regenerating tissue, they're real regenerate body parts. They built this woman a bladder. She had a. They took skin cells, stem cells from the skin and they with a p in a petri dish. They started this off and then built her a boy. She had bladder cancer and they built her a bladder and then put it in her body and it's functional. It's amazing. I mean this is all state of the art now and when we're looking at like 10, 20, 30 years from now, I mean you're looking at potentially regenerating all sorts of things, regenerating bone from people who have bone cancer, regenerating lungs and liver and spleen and heart.

Speaker 3:          01:07:01       I mean, they're going to be able to make body parts. They've created an artificial heart that beats like with stem cells. They've actually constructed a human heart. This is a subject, you know, selling, you're bound to, fascinated by it, fascinated by it, because what they're able to do now is just a, you know, you're just looking into the future. You get a window into this and it seems like it's exponentially exploding. I mean all over the world. There's people experimenting with this stuff and trying to figure out new ways to improve things, which is the fact that I'm having that conversation and this isn't the first conversation I've had in the last month about this. Yeah, it's pot. There's aunt gus. No. Oh, it is now. People are understanding it and people know people that have had issues with it. Um, you can't get it in America, but in Mexico, I know people that go over there and get it done intravenously and uh, you know, boss route and you know, boss boss route and the way he described on this big character, he's like. And it was like I had energy coming off my fingertips. I had some pretty significant problems. He's got fused disks in his neck and he had major atrophy in his arm because his disc was compressed and they. It was pushing on the nerves so the nerves

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       weren't getting. They weren't firing correctly, so his right arm, he calls baby arm because his right arm has kind of shrunk and so he's experimented with a lot of these things. He's kind of been ahead of the curve with this stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:08:28       You should get Jason Statham and I would love to you,

Speaker 1:          01:08:33       right? Yeah. It's very similar. These go a couple of tweaks here and there. I met him. He's a nice guy. He had a bunch of stuff going on with his body too. I'm sure he's a martial artist.

Speaker 2:          01:08:44       Better condition now. He used to be an Olympic diver. You should die for England. You know one of those, right? I'm fabulous athlete and he takes care of himself. I believe it. A good name, but you know he's got tweaks, got their own knee. That just never quite goes away. Little thing that he does his much and by the way, get him on diet and he's off to the races. You can't shut him up. He's got, you know, leave him there for three hours, come back kind of cutlet. We still banging on about it. It's something that he cares profoundly, but I can tell you now we're sitting in now there'll be a battle about you couldn't. Who was good to say what to whom because you'd talk over one another. Um, you should get him in, in a way he relate to best, you know, I'm sure.

Speaker 2:          01:09:34       Do you watch your diet? Are you a healthy eater? Not as healthy as I'd like to be. I'd go up and down. I play. I also liked with 30 pounds of extra nonsense. It's on. Yeah. Um, now I'm weighing 190. Now I should get one 92 actually today. And I should be creeping around a good fight and weigh about one slash 78. So what is it? Is it a booze Buddhist thing? It's not the booze. The booze isn't the issue in terms of the canneries itself. The booze is the window to the calories itself. The pizza, the pizza pizza man. But I do love a pub or a pub or they love a pump and a, a pack of crisps. You don't really have packet kitty corn chips over here. Not Quite the same thing. They're not, they don't know an English, an English crisp is a heavyweight chip.

Speaker 2:          01:10:22       Um, and they worked particularly well in pop. So it's two pints of Guinness and a couple of packs of crisps. And you've it in a thousand calories is complete nonsense in all about 22 minutes. I'm the salt to is very appealing where you're drinking a cold thing, just work chances each other, but it didn't take long before. There's a heavy price tag that comes with that. I train the law, recognized train weights three times a week and finding bread on the three times a week. I love training Kebab and it's trying to somehow reconcile that. And every now and then I'll behave myself a stay at the pub style off the booze for three months and I couldn't get myself down to one 78. However, it's been five, six years since I've been there. Now I dropped eight pounds the other day. Strictly I was strict with myself off the booze because I'm off the booze. I don't look at food in the same way. The thing that the whole purpose of boozers to relax trouble is as well. Also reluctance to the rules. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:11:28       Right. Now, when you're dealing with all these injuries, how are you able to train through all the stuff you've got to shoulder they think in one day might need to be replaced and needs that might need to be gone.

Speaker 2:          01:11:39       Crack on. Yeah. I found that and I'm sure you've had the same through Jujitsu. Whenever I get an injury, a font, if you stop messing around with it and paying too much attention to it, it kind of don't go on for longer. Nine or 10 million injuries are just try and through and there's almost a bluffing game that you have with the injury who was in charge had mailed the injury and once the injury knows that you mean it. It tends to move, walk out the door, but there are more fundamental ones like the shoulder and then the next, and I shouldn't say that actually has been giving me a bit of aggro recently. Um, so there were a few things that you need to take it serious. Now I can see you're onto this job. I can see you're focused on this. Yeah. Yeah. I know a lot about this stuff. Yeah. But you're invested. Yes. Right. And you need to be invested. If you mean it is, it's ownership again, your investment is ownership.

Speaker 3:          01:12:30       Well, my good friend Eddie Bravo just at his disc replaced. He had to replace with a titanium articulating lower back disc. So he had some pretty significant disc decompression or compression issues, uh, in deterioration. And it got to the point where his lower back was just constantly inflamed. You know, Eddie's worldclass blackpoll. Yeah. He just couldn't come anymore. Why didn't you send them to you? Oh Man. Well it was before they were actually shooting it into the desk. He had it done about a year ago, about a year ago, eight, nine months ago, something like that. So this might be one that whether you just hang on. Yeah, I would say with stem cells, with a lot of things, hang on, what some things you can hang on like a acl tears once the tear, once the ligament is removed you. There's nothing you can do. You have to ever replace a terrible thing.

Speaker 3:          01:13:15       Yeah. The acl and it's such a common injury, but you know what's interesting is once you get it replaced. Like for me, I had a Patella tendon graft on the left knee and then a cadaver graft on the right knee and had all sorts of things done. They. I've done it all, but neither one of them bother me at all anymore. And they're stronger. Like the, the. When they do a cadaver graft, they use the Achilles tendon, which is a 150 plus percent stronger than your original acl. So it actually makes it a stronger joint,

Speaker 2:          01:13:46       right? Melinda's. No.

Speaker 3:          01:13:48       Yeah. Well, the Patella tendon graft is still stronger than when they use a Patella tendon graft that is still strong in your patella tendon is a very huge tendon and you can, you can operate with a third of it missing, which is essentially what they cut out when they

Speaker 2:          01:14:02       my right leg, which has had the two acl, so I've noticed is atrophied and there's very little I can do to beef up that quad. That's probably because you're favoring

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       your left side. Yeah. But then you know, isolated and I'm beast the thing, but I just can't engage it. I can't get it flat leg like a can on my left leg, get it completely flat. Standard it. So it bends. Yes. Age or your courts does some stem cells in that bad boy. It's very exciting. Sorry. So yeah, it's, it's the real deal. I mean it's something special. Who's the years I've been living with it? Yeah. They can fix you up, take a fixture up. But diet is huge. One of the things about diet is inflammation and I never really wrapped that in my head and to see about three or four years ago I had a pretty significant back injury and then just say in my hands were numb and it was because I was ignoring it because I would pinch it in Jujitsu and then I'd go, oh, it's still going to roll light.

Speaker 1:          01:14:56       I'll just go in there and roll light and then after awhile it was getting bad to the point in my back was locking up and my hand started going numb and I give this pretty significant elbow pain, so I started really researching all the options and what's really going on in one of the big ones that I've found was diet. That when you have too many inflammation causing foods in your diet and reading too much sugar and bread and booze and all these different things that affects it. It affects like how your body carries fat, but it also affects where your body holds onto inflammation and joints in particular. All the injuries, spots were waste sore when I had a shitty diet. So give me, give me the evils. Um, as Laird Hamilton calls them the three white devils. Sugar bread.

Speaker 1:          01:15:44       What's the other one? Yeah, what is the other one? Booze. The kind of white foam on bears. White. What is it? You should know what? The three white flour. Pasta, sugar. I don't know. What is either one. Dairy. I guess. Mary. There you go. Yeah. I like cheese though. So do you don't drink alcohol? Yeah, I do. Yeah, we try not to drink too much. I mean it's like all things in moderation, including moderation. Yeah. I mean, I'm not a big drinker. I don't like. I'm not drinking every night, but if I go out, you know, and I have a drink or have a glass of wine with dinner or a couple of glasses, I'm, I'm cool. I think it's just a matter of just controlling yourself. That's really the thing. So, uh, the three white devils, you do subscribe to three white devils. I occasionally will allow myself to dance with the devil, but the little three of them.

Speaker 1:          01:16:38       Yeah. Well, a little bit of sugar, a little bit like last night I had some linguine with clams. I don't. I go on an 80 slash 20, which means 80 percent of my diet is very clean and then 20 percent off fuck off, like whether it's Saturday or Friday or whatever. Had you feel about rural milk on posturized love. I Love Rob Melton. I'm opening. I'm opening a little raw milk dairy. Are you really? I am. I'm having, I'm very interested in this health thing. I'm more from a culinary point of view that I am from a nutritional point of view. However, I suspect,

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       I suspect that there's a sweet spot here. I'm opening a brewery. I love a beer. You're opening a brewery to brewery? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:17:18       Which, how much do you know about making beer? Yeah, quite a lot actually. Have you been doing it on your own?

Speaker 2:          01:17:24       Done all that sort of asking around underneath the stairs routine for years. Um, which is great fun. I like any sort of form of caveman chemistry, Francis Mammon. Mammon is, it's big fan of that sort of thing. I'm a bit of a caveman when it comes to anything to do with food, so I do like a nice steak outside. I'll take my uncle if I say so myself. I'm on good on a barbecue and I'd been. I'd been doing that barbecuing for 20 years. Good. On a slow cook. Take that quite seriously. Um, but. So yeah, only brewery beer. And then when I'm on it I'm, I'm putting a butcher, a baker, the candlestick makers to. It's gotten a small hotel place in, uh, in England. Fifteen hundred acres farm. Got All that sort of nonsense going on.

Speaker 1:          01:18:12       So you're going to do farm to table the whole deal. I'll make your beer. Yeah. Raise your own animals. Serve them. Yeah. The whole thing just got to get into. So yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:18:22       Yeah. I mean jeans traditionally in English drink, but I wasn't really into it until I came to America and I've found since I've been here in the last, over the last week,

Speaker 1:          01:18:31       it's been quite a few gin and tonics going on. Yeah. And, and apparent is the easiest of the spirits to mix all my little swing on that too. I'm good friends with maynard keen in lead singer of tool and he went essentially for for years, just went and developed his own vineyard at. Where is he? Arizona. Yeah, and not in a place in Arizona that's known for growing wine, so he had to manipulate the soil and a baby's having a lovely time. He loves it. Yeah. He's probably quite an expensive, lovely time though, isn't it? I'm sure he's making money with it now, but he's. He's like a legitimate genius and he's one of those guys that he cannot be stagnant. It's not even an option. I mean his mind works a thousand miles an hour and when you're talking to him you just kind of kind of jumped on the train and hang on there with them as long as you can jump off and go, Ooh.

Speaker 1:          01:19:20       But he's just a very, very, very intense guy. And his, his particular brand of intellectual curiosity led him to start experimenting with one. His wine is absolutely fantastic and these are legitimate wine expert like you sit here and talk to them the same way you and I can talk about boot Chechnya or Hadzic, racier, Henzel. He can talk to you about why and he's also a purple belt in Jujitsu to so he can talk to him. He's an intense guy. I liked the sound of this. The one business I do find interesting. There's something happen.

Speaker 2:          01:19:52       Learning with the whole craft movement general, that's very exciting that we are going back to local stuff and people to a degree it's ownership again. Yes. It's take ownership of your food, take ownership of everything to do with the important components of your life and it'll got robbed from us. Yeah. You know, what happened in the seventies in the UK is all these breweries bought up all the pumps and they brought up all these small breweries and used to have all these breweries with their own little crafty beer going on and then they have merchandised it and then he sold it back to us and they gave it back to us with that character and we just bought it because we were stupid. Right? Yeah. And then what's happening is we realized that character is important and local character is important and ownership is important. So there's this movement, um, and to a degree things like instagram may have a dark side, but it was as a light side is given a voice to the craft movement on like a man that makes his own knives.

Speaker 1:          01:20:55       Yeah. And followed any of that stuff. What are handmade knives? All the time. That's what I use to like cut my food. Like they feel good. I like it. It's a completely different experience. I have exactly the same thing.

Speaker 2:          01:21:07       We order a lot of army knives and when you're cutting your food with a handmade knife, it's not what it used to be. You realize a knife should be a thing thing

Speaker 1:          01:21:16       and it got robbed from us. Do you know Steve Kramer is a number of days a guy who makes knives with media rights? Yes, I do know I've seen him. I said there's a little thing with Anthony Bourdain. Say now I'm sitting there thinking the people dynamic he takes a chunk of it came from space. It's fabulous. Yeah, it's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. I actually, I got a feeling that might have been the genesis of my interest in knowledge with antibody thing. There's a guy, a mousy fire arts, find that on Instagram, but he just made me this Damascus steel cutting knife and uh, on a hunting knife to go with it. And it's just. I mean, I cut with it, but it's this. I stare at it for minutes before I cut with it. I look at the blade and the handle's made out a thousand year old bog would like wood that was preserved from a Bhag, Bhag.

Speaker 1:          01:22:04       Maple. It's amazing, this is amazing, but why is it so interesting? But the faculty, this is interesting. Look at the pattern in the. In the steel Damascus steel, if you go to his instagram, there's a picture of my knife in there. You could see it. He, this guy is. I mean that's it right there at the far right. Far those two. Those are the two knives that he made for me. That's a sexy bit of kit. Those ancient bog oak. That's what it is. What is it? What's the bulk from? Is that an American bug? I don't know. I'd have to ask him. I just took his word for it, but look at that thing. That's lovely. That's what I used to cut up. Garlic all sold excalibur. We've made that Domestica scale man. Really? I'm into a band. Damascus stuff. Did you have a blade?

Speaker 1:          01:22:49       Smith fashioned for your moving? Uh, yeah. Wow. So you had it specifically made for the movie? Yeah. Poor old Charlie Hunnam who plays King off there is. It'd be waiting to receive this sword. How much does it weigh? I mean, this motherfucker had to get in shape for that thing, right? Yeah, always in good. Nick. You're like, you ever do those? Um, uh, like a shield cast with a steel club. You realize how difficult it is to manipulate even a 15 pound club. Yeah. Bit of hard work. Very hard work. If those guys like sword fighters must have had intense shoulder strength and core strength.

Speaker 2:          01:23:24       Yeah. But they think these guys are in the UK. They every now and then they stumbled across a body that's a thousand 500 years old and they realized the deformity in the shoulders, the right, whatever you call that. When you pull a biobank. Yeah. Um, and they used to be in English law that every Englishman had to practice for eight hours a week to pull back above. So you've go these skeletons that are deformed from the enormous strength of the soldiers to these on the shelf

Speaker 1:          01:23:53       deformed. How so, like what, what is the issue with it?

Speaker 2:          01:23:55       It was the sheer Yolanda Joe, you know, a lot more about this than me, but the, they had become deformed through the development of the muscle, which in some way then changed the bone structure. Bone structure. Yeah. Wow. These massive, great, right arms. Those, I don't know if, you know, in the UK, you know, in this country you do this, the finger is, is the single finger in the UK. It's two fingers,

Speaker 1:          01:24:23       right? But why is that? It's for bows and arrows, right.

Speaker 2:          01:24:25       Comes from the English wars and the French was um, and the Englishman we're famous for that long bows and the famous battle of agincourt where there was a couple hundred of us and it was 10,000 of them and they're liberal. They, uh, they had crossbows back then and we had this long boat along the way was the machine. Yeah. In the a bow and Arrow world. And because the Brits, that's what they did, they were a, as a week, every Englishman have to do that, that they were pretty lethal with these things. Anyway, they annihilated the entire French army. There was a famous battle of the French have conveniently forgotten. Um, so what the French did thereafter, if they have recorded Englishman, was they chopped off two of his fingers, pull back the bow. So whenever a, as, as history, then I'm made eloquent, is that whenever you saw a freshmen used to waive the two fingers up at him and then since then it's now just become ubiquitous fuck off sign.

Speaker 1:          01:25:31       Have you seen the way the Mongols did it? The Mongols, they had these incredibly powerful recurve bows and would take 160 pounds to pull back and they use their thumb. They would have a, a thumb ring made out of bone. Have you seen that? No. I have a bungalow. They therapy. There's a fantastic audio documentary on the history of the Mongols, the wrath of the con with Dan Carlin and I listen to that. Yeah, it's amazing. Yeah. I'll even out there. There's a bit of a fan of yours that he keeps me up to date on the different things that you're in because he's

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       interested in the same things. I didn't know about the knives and there's a couple of other things I didn't know that you knew about, but he's a big fan. He got me onto this. See those things. We might, I think he got onto this because you've got them onto I'm sure, but once you hear Dan Carlin, I mean, it is absolutely addictive, but this is the ring that they would put on their thumb and they would pull back like that and then they would wrap their index finger over the thing where the, uh, the thumb nail is and then pull it back that way. And then release. That's how they would release their arrows. Well, it didn't get very far, did it? Well, it did for a long time until gang is Kahn died. I mean, they killed 10 percent of the population they killed. I mean, I was kidding.

Speaker 3:          01:26:45       Joking around. They killed so many people that change the carbon footprint of earth. There was a New York Times article about how many people died during gingiss Khan's reign. That it was so significant. You could see it in the carbon data. You're kidding. No, no, I'm not kidding. See if he could pull that article that he killed between 50 and 70 million people during his lifetime were directly attributed to his army and his decisions. Fifty to 70 million people died. The conservative estimate is somewhere around 30 to liberal estimate is somewhere around 70. Nobody really knows what they think. It's between that Mongol invasion in 1200 altered carbon dioxide levels. It killed so many fucking people at this time. Earth where there was probably only a million people kicking around on it. I don't know how many people there were. I thought there was a lot more than a million because they killed a million people in China.

Speaker 3:          01:27:38       They killed. They killed people in numbers that we can. Even in Jen, I think it was Jen China, they showed up and this was part of the Dan Carlin series, the, um, the show, the corpsmen and shaw sent a, like an envoy, like a party to go search this, a city in China. And as they pulled up, they thought what they saw in the distance was a snow covered mountain. As they got closer, they realized it was a stack of bones and the roads were so deteriorated from human bodies, just rotting human bodies. They had abandoned the roads because they couldn't get their cars through there. Their wheels rather through because their wheels were getting bogged down. Their horses were getting bogged down in the muck of deteriorating bodies as so many people. The Mongols killed. What the Fuck I was at? Just the design for empire. It's a real good question. First of all, is the dehumanization of the enemy. I mean, his idea was that everybody who doesn't live in a tent and anybody who doesn't live the way they do these fools that live in cities, they weren't even human. There were sheep like. There was a certain disconnect between them and the other, which is imperative. It's the most important thing in war. You have to decide that that person's not you. Right? You have decided that there the other, whether it's the Vietnamese or the Germans,

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       the Nazis, the Japanese like whatever it is, you have to decide that they are less than you and they had this thing about people that did not live like they did, that they were pussies, these, these weak people that lived in these cities with their walls and so they would just find, find these cities. They'd stroll up and they would just figure out a way to start attacking them and they would light bodies on fire and launched them with catapults onto the roofs of these buildings. But what was the. What was the motivation? It was just conquering. Just conquering. I mean, they just wanted to expand their empire and take over. I mean, it's not. There's no noble pursuit and there is no religious pursuit either. I mean, it's a expansion. Yeah. Will. They just wanted to own it all. They, they felt like everyone they encountered was subject to their rule and they had to.

Speaker 1:          01:29:49       They had to establish that sip very, very intense series. Now remember, I remember I caught into about five years ago. I don't remember the bone thing with the bone thing in off, but I've got mountains of bone. Oh, nice. Now. But uh, I do remember some of that food. How things drift. You'd appreciate this. This is a legitimate Samurai sword from the 15 hundreds. Really? Yeah. That's a real one. Well, that's quite sexy time. Was this shock skin going on up here? I don't know. I mean, I think that the, uh, the case is probably a, a modern case, but that blade itself, that is a, that is a blade from somewhere around 1511. They think. How'd you get your hands on this? It was a gift from my business associate. Aubrey Marcus, a good buddy of mine. And um, we're in business at onnit together and he gave me this.

Speaker 1:          01:30:39       That's quite a thing. Yeah, it's quite a thing. That's a real thing. It's not one of these blades that once you take out, you go to draw blood, is it? No, no, no. Anything. We go this a military unit in the UK called the workers that come from the poll. That's been a tradition for a couple of hundred years and they have these funded little knives hooks on. Yeah, they're weird. Nice. We ate the lives and once they draw them, once they're at the sheath that they're not allowed to put them back into this. Got Blood on him so they have to cut themselves and the Catholic. Anybody, anybody Christ. I was like a weird excuse to cut yourself. Yeah, I mean doesn't that. That's like a pretty rigid requirement. Don't draw unless you're going to draw blood. What can I tell you? I mean, being a soldier, tufts stuff, it is as tough as it gets. Yeah. Now that says something about your film I'm sure is you're dealing with a a different time and that life back then, although always precious. The finite aspect of life is more solidified. It's more obvious. It's more. It's something that you're dealing with on a daily basis as opposed to the way we live. Yeah. I think there's all sorts of advantages to that. If you're looking down the barrel of a gun, nothing so busy looking down the barrel of a gun and we've managed to distract ourselves by be comfortable

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       liberal lives that we lead and that the price for that is that we don't really accept the full accountancy of life, so we do give ourselves crutches where you look down the barrel of a gun or your crutches and taken away. So I suppose in different periods of time you didn't have to. You didn't have the indulgence of being able to worry about what people thought of you because there were more important things to worry about.

Speaker 1:          01:32:28       Yeah, yeah. There were more important things to worry about than social media. You have to worry about arrows. Swords, death. Yeah. Constant.

Speaker 2:          01:32:37       The thing is that even come back to the Mongols, so what was his desire for gain? His desire for gain with the more people appreciate and respect me. Then the more I'll be, is there anything else that kills people other than that motivation?

Speaker 2:          01:32:54       Not like that. Well, not even like that. I'm just doing about murder, right? The whole genesis of murder is based on the principle that someone has more power than me, so I have to take that power away, or my comparative sense of self feels augmented if I can take that life away. Hmm. No. Comes back to the same thing. You're really asking someone to tell you who you are and if you have paradoxically and ironically if you killed them, that makes you more powerful than them. Although they can no longer bear witness or they did bear witness for a second, but what does bear witness is the story in your mind that somehow you are now more powerful

Speaker 1:          01:33:34       or just fucking hate them. You don't want them around anymore, but why did you hate them? Because they're threatening. Yes. Threatening to some way a threatening in some way that somehow they can diminish your idea of who you are or you find them repugnant, their actions, repugnant dangers to their society, something then that's not murder, then it's just eliminating an enemy. Right? Or eliminating a threat. Yeah. If you could go back, I mean I've often thought about this as technology evolves, like will there be come a point in time where you can have a window to a certain era, like we'll, we'll time machines ever be a thing where there's a time where you could actually go back and view the past. Is there a period? Yeah, zero period that you wanted to quite a lot

Speaker 2:          01:34:22       because of google earth on one of those. I like a good porn on google earth, so where I live in wheelchair, the guard house in English, countryside next door to stonehenge. If you go on Google plus where they plowed the fields, you can see where there had been burial sites for thousands of years. Alright, good. Stonehenge is about five and a half thousand years old, but all around that area, in these plow fields you can see they've still got married, old bounds and a burial mounds and whatnot and the whole earth is littered with prehistorical earthworks and burial sites and there were burial sites that we have this thing called Ordinance survey which registers. I mean, but you will have the same thing. He was registered is everything on the earth, right, so everything of any historical value, there's a map and they tell you what the foot paths are and the roads are and everything's been highly detailed, how high the mountains are and the roads and whatnot, and I'm a bit of an Anorak for that.

Speaker 2:          01:35:24       You know the expression and right now it's like a geek. Okay. You know those guys at trains and planes and they usually wear those jackets go down. Anorexia is where the Christian counseling, so I'm a bit of an Anorak for typography. The history of typography, so you go and Google Earth. This was a bit of a wet dream as far as I was concerned because I could spend hours and hours pouring over landscape and around my house. You can find these, all these burial sites that no one knows existed and is only as good as google earth. It's just an arm confident that still I'm the only person that knows these burial. These burial sites exist. So how do you know their barriers sites? Like what are you seeing? Because you can build up a, an understanding of pattern recognition. Again, you can see an established burial site which is seen as a prehistorical parasite bronze age or whatever it is, and then you get step a mile to the right and then you can find one under a plowed field where they've got rid of the mounds, but you can still see the depressions, which isn't exactly the same shape as the depression's a mile to the right.

Speaker 2:          01:36:32       And then you can build up a whole pattern. So this is the area where you get crop circles. Yeah. So. And then you can build up a whole picture which is a much bigger picture. And then you can start to predict where one burial site is going to be and it's a bit like finding treasure and you go to 100 yards that direction, $200 and it should be about a bang. There it is. You can see half of these depressions and then it runs into a word or whatever it is. But this staff that exists and you wouldn't have known before Google Earth came along. How much work has been done on like trying to study those things? Well, the thing is on Joel quite a lot, but the thing is, is prehistorical, so they're really the only thing that is there is arrowheads, right? And burial mounts and every now and then they dig one up and then they find a boat buried with a lot of gold and that happens every now and then.

Speaker 2:          01:37:24       Um, but there isn't much evidence that was left behind. So, you know, most of these things are just amount of earth with few bones it. But it's kind of crazy because that's an area where people have been living for thousands of years. It's not like people went away and then came back and now you're trying to, like, people have consistently lived in that area. Like, and then the, you see things like that horse, that stone horse in the, in the countryside. Yeah. The course was a big man with a big willie to who's made that chalk chalk. You can look him up. He is a man with the big white willie. Um, anyone in that area that you have these different emblems of what represented tribes or whatever. So we now live in the UK, which is the United Kingdom, but there is a legacy that, I mean you'll have the same here.

Speaker 2:          01:38:17       There is a legacy there that you can, you can trace back step by step for thousands of years and we get, you know, get my not around the Romans. That was a couple of thousand years ago and the Romans been kicking around the UK a couple of thousand years and then they went and then in came the saxons. Um, and then after the saxons than the French came in. And then the French basically took over the UK in 10, 66. And then you have the culture that we have now, but you can see, you somehow you forget that it go that your culture goes on for thousands of years and you accept really what we see as history is the last 6,000 years old, 5,000 years. But when you can have a connection to it and it goes back further than that, it's hard to get. You're not around the Romans, nevermind the bronze age.

Speaker 2:          01:39:10       Yeah, and almost what is that? There's the guy with the big willie. Holy Shit. What an odd. How old is that? Then I say I'm old. It is. There's lots of that that goes on around the guy running that you fully erect with a giant club. How strange and there's a bunch of these and they do. They understand the origins of these things and they know where they came from. I have no is the answer to that. These are later. They look quite primitive. I think these are later. How strange, but that whole area is littered in this sort of paraphernalia if you will. Yeah, and they don't necessarily know who did it or why now, but what's exciting to someone like me is that you aren't going through any other conduit and I suppose it's what it is. It's the mystery. It's the mythology of all of this, but it's your road into it as an individual.

Speaker 2:          01:40:10       You're not cancer. Any history books, you're seeing it and it's like discovering treasure. You can access it on your own, on Google Earth, and you're thinking, is anyone else doing this? Why would they be doing it? I started doing it because I wanted to see. I can't remember some aspects on some poem Atlanta before. No. Oh look, there's a burial site. I'll have a little look. And then before, you know, breadcrumbs lead to bakeries and you find yourself filling your boots with all the pastries in the world. Um, and it's something very exciting about that. So in reference to what it was that you said earlier, if I could go back to any time, a lot of cut back for a minute, I'm not sure I'd go back for for long. I see that the period that we're living in is the most exciting period to live on this planet.

Speaker 2:          01:41:00       And not not least. So because of what we've been talking about stem cells, is that going to be the thing that allows you and I to age more gracefully and without so much pain? We have enough wealth that we can live a comfortable life. If you decide, if you choose to live a comfortable life. We have medicine that we'd never had before this period in history. It is. We are still complaining was still complaining, but if we could just remember what we are comparatively, where the position we are in history comparatively. It's an end to all complaints.

Speaker 3:          01:41:44       Yeah, comparatively for sure. It's interesting too when you're talking about this, the use of technology and how what you can do now with stem cells in comparison, the pesticide, because it's really exciting, emerging time but similar like the use of google earth to discover these mounds and things and we see what's going on in the Amazon now they're. They're discovering evidence of civilizations that were just rumors and myths like the gold city, the ancient gold city that there's that. What is that movie that there is a lost city of Z. Yes. They're finding these established irrigation paths and city grids in the Amazon jungle. Thousands and thousands of years old and they don't know the origins. They don't know who was there. They don't know why they're constructed, what the culture was like, but this was all at one point in time, just mythological and now they're realizing like, no, no, no, this is history and this is.

Speaker 3:          01:42:38       They've been told and passed down and these fables and now we understand there's an actual. There's a concrete physical grid rather that you can go and you could see like, no, these are real cities that did exist and the jungle is sort of engulfed them. It's taken over them. It's amazing, eh? It's a thing bulaff oh, it's incredible. I mean it's allowing, and this is only step one. I think Google Earth is going to give way to some sort of a magnetic resonance type thing where they're going to be able to look deep into the ground. I think what we're seeing now is you're, you're going to be able to. You're right. Now we're exploring the surface of the earth and we're finding all these characteristics that, oh, this is a body or this is a a burial area. This is a pathway that was probably irrigation, but I think they're going to be able to come up with technology that allows you to do the same thing but look deep into the ground and then I think you're gonna be able to find all kinds of crazy shit the same way they can understand like the complete topography of the bottom of the ocean now and if you look at some of those maps that show the ocean and literally shows the depths at every stage you, I think you're going to be able to do that deep into the surface of the ground.

Speaker 3:          01:43:42       They're going to be able to discover all kinds of crazy stuff. Someone keeps opening that door. What are you saying? We got to get going. This is why I don't allow people to come ruined into a perfect God damn conversation. That's

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       all I've. I know I haven't. It's great because you biggest fan. I'm a big fan of him. You got some other commitments? I guess so. I do. Yes. I'm selling a film and I'll show you. Go ahead and say it. You're like, fuck yeah. I'm going to go see it. I love all your movies, man. I'm a big fan. I was really excited to have you in here. So, uh, when is it out this weekend? Not this weekend. Next weekend. So that is Ivan. Do you want to stick your head back in and Ivan's. He's scared now. You scared him off? I, even if it's not this weekend, it's next weekend. Is that may the twelfth? It's the weekend after guardians of the galaxy is. I believe that is may the twelfth. Right. Excited about it. Yeah. I love the film. I like it was a tough out there that brother.

Speaker 1:          01:44:34       I bet it is tough. You've got a crazy business when you decide. And I'll just leave you with this. When you decide like to commit to an idea, I'm sure you have a gang of ideas bouncing around your head. Like what makes you just go, all right, this is the one. Let's run with it. Telling how changing and it changes by the year. My next movie is Aladdin. Oh really? Yeah, like the magic lamp. That's the one really? Yeah. And in no small part, because you know, you get a weekend a right, so that plays a little bit of a factor in your motivation, but it has to, you don't spend three years on a movie and no one hear about it. Right a lot. And they'll buy you would be very fascinating. I'll find it. You know, I liked the idea of taking the genres that I don't know anything about retail.

Speaker 1:          01:45:22       Is it kind of excited you like doing this King Arthur thing and in this fantasy genre, and this is sort of a changed your expectations for possibly considering other. I sort of did English gangster films from that. And then Sherlock Holmes don't stop doing those though. Gangster films has to be TV. It could be TV. Were lots of that now because that's where it's gone. That's sort of interesting. Netflix, hbo type stuff, that sort of stuff. Um, and then man from uncle, which is like a spy thing, and then he jumped to the spine genre. So let me go. Oh right, okay. I can go from this to that genre and that's exciting. And I've got five kids and he got five, five kids. Wow. Which means I'm familiar with Disney, right? Of course. So yeah, all that. What? That world looks very attractive and challenging. Awesome guy, reggie or bad motherfucker. Thank you joe. I Love Avenue in here. Thank you. It's been a great pleasure. I enjoyed it enormously. I was. Do it again next time. Your sound. Something. Come on in, baby. Thank you. All right folks. That's it for the week. We'll see you soon. Bye. Much love. Thank you.
