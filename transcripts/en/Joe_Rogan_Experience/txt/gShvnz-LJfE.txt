Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Five, four, three, two, one. And we're live a welcome aboard. Jessica Rosenworcel. Did I do it? You did. I was so nervous about that. And Eddie won, of course, has been on the podcast many times. Number one podcast in the world. Oh, thank you. You are. What's up brother? How are you? I'm chilling man. I'm good. I just, you know, I wanted to introduce you to the Homie, the commissioner from the FCC, Jessica Rosenworcel because things, things where things are bad for the Internet right now. Well you are very concerned and a lot of people are about net neutrality and uh, we all have some questions about it and we're excited to talk to you about it. So maybe we could eliminate some of the issues and, and give us a, an understanding or try to help us understand what's at stake here and why are people so concerned?

Speaker 2:          00:00:54       Well, I think people are concerned because the future of the Internet. So the future of everything. I mean, every aspect of our lives is now touched by that connectivity and it's a funny thing, but the agency where I work in Washington, the Federal Communications Commission has enormous power and control over our internet experience and for decades we've had these policies that have been all about Internet openness and what that means is you can go where you want, do what you want online and your broadband provider can't get in the way or prevent you from looking at some websites are looking at some videos or setting up some businesses, but that changed last month in Washington when the FCC over my objections voted to end net neutrality and as a result, all of our broadband providers now have the legal right to block websites, to throttle content, and to set up sweetheart paid for prioritization deals and over the long haul. That could really change the Internet and the web as we know it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:03       Now. What are the arguments? Pro Net neutrality? I'm one of the arguments for people that were excited about this being signed when they were saying that net neutrality was really only over the last couple of years and before the last couple of years, net neutrality as we know it the last couple of years, everything was fine and that it'll continue to be fine and that people are just panicked and there was that really bizarre video that that one dude made where he was sharing that these are all the things you're going to be able to do. You work with that cat. I do a pie. Yeah. He seems like an odd fellow. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:02:40       Yeah. Well, uh, he's a, he's a smart guy. He's a seasoned lawyer. I think it's fair to say he and I see the world a little bit

Speaker 1:          00:02:46       differently. Yeah. So he doesn't, he sees this through the eyes of big business, right? He thinks that this is a free market, let the market decide and um, and that's what the argument. I mean, I've even heard mark Cuban was

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       arguing against it, so I was like, wow, this is stunning. Yeah. Noodle. For me, the net neutrality thing is huge because when I was in law school, I read this one book called fighting for air and it documented like the telecommunications act in [inaudible] 97. It's like boring stuff, right? Don't go read the Telecommunications Act in [inaudible] 97, but like radio mattered to me. Remember like growing up with the radio, like I remember they would actually break records on the radio back in the day, like funk flux still does it on hot 97 and he'll break records. He broke my boy old drew's record the other day, but like recently it's like clear channel Iheartradio. They own all the radio stations and it really sterilized content and they play the same songs every hour in every city almost around the world. And I. When I read that book and I went to law school, I realized I was like, Yo, it was because of the deregulation of radio that allowed for all these local independent radio stations in every city that we're wrapping local culture and state culture. That kind of eroded that means of communication. And I was like, this happens to every single industry we have, whether it's radio, television, but now it's coming for the Internet and by deregulating it you're gonna gut it again. And you know, like when, when technology started popping in, podcast came around. I mean that's what enabled jre and that's why my first place to goes like I'm a come see jail because you were one of the innovators with this new technology.

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       Well

Speaker 3:          00:04:33       thanks. But I think what people are super concerned about is things getting blocked, right? That's like one of the first ones. Is that something that we legitimately have to worry, I worry about?

Speaker 2:          00:04:45       Is it? Good question. Here's what I know right now. Your broadband provider has the technical ability to block content and websites. It's got the business incentive to block or slow access to some websites if they don't have a special commercial relationship with them. So now the FCC just gave them the legal green. Right? Just go ahead. And so I feel over time this is something we need to be concerned about. And so this open platform that was full of independent, independent voices, now you've got this new gatekeeper, your broadband provider, they've got a lot more power than what they used to. How close was the vote? It was three. Two. And what's the argument for this? Well, that's, that's fair. Um, I think there's an argument that you want government out of the way deregulation is going to lead to more competition and we'll have a flourishing of new ideas and content if we just moved government out of the way.

Speaker 2:          00:05:48       And even if you're sympathetic to that argument, here's where I think it breaks down according to the FCC, his own data, half of the households this country don't have a choice of broadband provider. I am familiar with this. I'm one of them, only have one provider that serves my house. So the thing is, if you're a broadband provider started blocking your content or throttling your access to some video in a competitive market, you'd pick up, you take your business somewhere else. But about half of our households don't even have that opportunity. So to me, the idea that the competitive market will prevent this behavior just doesn't fly.

Speaker 1:          00:06:26       Yeah. That doesn't seem to make sense. And that that's an issue in my neighborhood as well. And a lot of other people I know as well. I mean, I think they make deals where only one company, whether it's verizon or whatever, has an area.

Speaker 3:          00:06:37       Yeah. They monopolize the areas. They limit the opportunities and choices and when they say deregulation, it just anytime they deregulate things and say, hey, we're going to leave it to the market and have competition, I think it's impossible to have that when you have a country with such an inequality, income inequality gap. Right. That's the problem is that all right, let's all go compete Joe. You're not going to start a verizon. I'm not going to start a verizon. You know what I mean? Like we can't compete with these dudes and even comcast can't even compete with verizon. Like you know, these dudes were all getting smashed. So there is not actual competition. I think deregulation works when you have multiple players and options and that the market actually can come into play. But with the economy, so top heavy right now, I don't think there is a possibility of company.

Speaker 2:          00:07:23       Yeah, I mean listen, competition is the best regulator we know, right? We want there to be these markets where consumers have lots and lots of choices. But if competition is an existing, you need a little oversight to make sure that every consumer gets a fair shot.

Speaker 1:          00:07:37       Well, it seems like that's where the real argument lies, that if there are monopolies and there seemed to be in certain areas with in regards to what kind of Internet access you can get, that if you don't have regulation, then then what is going to protect the consumer and what is going to protect free speech. What's going to protect it? Say if you are on verizon and your system is on verizon, what have you decided to make a podcast that criticizes verizon and everybody says, you know, hey, Eddie [inaudible] got a podcast criticizing us. I want to shut that down. And they can just.

Speaker 3:          00:08:07       I would have been shut down a long time ago.

Speaker 2:          00:08:09       Yeah. Yeah. We're not saying that they would do that, but they could. Yeah. And that's what's scary, that's not good, you know, so much of our speech these days, it doesn't take place in public places. It takes place on these private platforms. So they have a lot of power and we have to think about that as a, as a country in a democracy, how much openness do we want? And then how do we create a framework in Washington that supports that openness. And that's really to me what net neutrality is.

Speaker 3:          00:08:38       The other question I have is right, let's say I'm the, you know, versus let's say a service provider Buys Hulu, right? Or, or they buy or they create their own streaming platform called Zulu, right? So they start Zulu, they could start to charge netflix more money for using their service. They could charge more money, they could charge, you know, beats more money, whatever, so that they have an advantage for their own streaming services in, in that, that way they can culturally control content. And you know, you're so right.

Speaker 2:          00:09:15       And what happens is you as a consumer, you just get online and you might not even notice, right? You might not even notice they're taking you to the video content that they have a special pay for relationship with. I think though the biggest harm is to entrepreneurship. Yeah, that's right. Now, look, you have a good idea. You got a business, a service. You can go online and you can almost instantly have global reach. That's amazing, but now you're going to have to figure out is your broadband provider instead going to shuffle off all your traffic to someone else who's paying them on the side? Are you going to have a fair shot to show your wares and your ideas to the world?

Speaker 3:          00:09:55       It's harder because I start thinking like a bad one percenter, dude, and I'm like, all right, if there's no net neutrality and I'm the only person that can service Calabasas, California, Woodland Hills, California, well I'm going to charge all the other streaming providers more money to use this and I'm going to create a competitor and every single one of these sectors so you can have an advantage. If you have your show with me and if you're on the other one, I'm going to disadvantage you. I'm going to tax you basically.

Speaker 1:          00:10:25       So right now these are concerns and there's nothing that's actually happening yet. Is this. This ruling was just passed. That's right. Are there any plans in place for things that we should be concerned with and is there anything that we can do about this current ruling?

Speaker 2:          00:10:44       Yes, there's loads because I'm not giving up and the fight for net neutrality and I don't want you to either. We got a few different pathways ahead. First in Congress right now, they are trying to get rid of what just happened at the FCC. They're trying to use this law called the Congressional Review Act that an effect just undid everything that the FCC just did. So it's a way to wipe out what just happened and while the odds are long, there's more than 40 United States senators who have sponsored that law and in the house side there's more than 80 members of the House of Representatives. So there's momentum growing in Congress to take a look at this issue and maybe fixed what the FCC did, and if you're sitting out there and thinking they're not listening to you, we should do something totally old fashioned. You should pick up the phone, call your members of Congress and your representatives and let them know you care about this issue because that still today is one of the most powerful ways of conveying your opinion to those who represent you.

Speaker 2:          00:11:47       When is the vote happening on that? It is not yet scheduled. I think it's going to happen first in the United States Senate and later in the house. I also think we are going to have litigation. We've already got a few states attorneys general who want a sued to overturn this. We've got some big companies and public interest groups, so I think it's fair to say we're going to court and then we're also seeing activity in state houses and that we've seen net neutrality legislation introduced in Nebraska, Nevada, Washington state, Massachusetts, California. Lots of places, and I'm not sure how that all comes together legally, but what you see as this momentum growing, that people are not happy with what Washington just did.

Speaker 3:          00:12:32       The thing that I'm worried about with the state's laws. Right, so just to lay it out for the listeners, right. There's people will, will, the government will pass the federal law, but then states have their own rights to regulate certain things. Let's say we use marijuana laws as an example because recently a lot of states past legal marijuana laws, right? But then trump gave people the power to enforce federal laws about marijuana more stringently. Right? He was telling the federal government, Hey, enforce our federal marijuana laws. What's really jeff sessions, right? Chefs, yeah, his goon is doing that, but so how would federalism work if states started to pass their own net neutrality laws versus the the, the FCC Commissioner Orleans,

Speaker 2:          00:13:19       yeah. Those are hard questions. I mean, they'd go right to the constitution. What's interstate? What's within the state's authority, but I'm just standing back and seeing really just a lot of energy on this issue. There's nothing else that I've worked on in Washington where this immediately statehouses decided to put pen to paper and introduce legislation and I think that that momentum is what's really exciting here.

Speaker 1:          00:13:42       Well, I think everyone understands the insane power of the Internet and what, what a cultural shift that we've experienced over the last 20 years. I mean it's unprecedented in human history. There's never been anything like it in terms of access to information, in terms of the rate of change, the way people look at things, the way the issues get discussed, the cycle of news, which is like, what, 10 hours now? Stories come in and out. I mean Hawaii just had a fake missile attack and everybody already forgot it already onto the next like what's the next thing we posted? Check my phone because I think we have to fix that. We should certainly happened in Hawaii. Someone went crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:14:23       Still learning. It looks like it was a state level issue, but you can't have things like that happen. We got to figure out a way in this digital world that we get accurate information to people faster and we we got to come up with better systems than the one we just saw.

Speaker 1:          00:14:37       You need somebody pressed a button and send out a text that said that there's an incoming ballistic missile. It's a possibility of threat of an incoming ballistic missile and this is not a drill. And then I have friends in Hawaii and everyone went crazy. People were crying in the streets, no one knew what to do. And of course this is a state that was attacked, you know, less than 100 years ago during World War Two. So this is not an unusual thing for them.

Speaker 4:          00:15:01       Yeah. I had the privilege of working for senator in a way from Hawaii years ago and I think Hawaiians are, you know, they're graceful. They're resilient, but they live with the knowledge that they are susceptible to some attack. So this gave them 40 minutes, 40 minutes of their life. And the amazing thing to me is it took like 10 minutes or so for this to be corrected on twitter. Took, took off another half hour for our official systems to update and say, in fact this was a mistake. Yeah. Once we found out, figure that out, let that happen. Yeah. But then once I figured out it was a mistake, I was like, Whoa, maybe I should ask Jessica if we could send like a national message on my birthday. 12 am, March first, and be like, you up just a nationwide booty call.

Speaker 4:          00:15:49       The FCC will not be helping in that regard. I had to ask. That's a big question, but what Joe was saying about the Internet and how it opened things up like personally for me, like today's Martin Luther King Jr Day. Right. And uh, I remember reading letter from Birmingham jail as a kid, Johnathan swift, modest proposal as a kid and Tupac a me against world. Those were like the three works that made me want to write. And I started writing since I was 15 years old. Never gave up, but no one would buy my writing. Right. The only place that would by my writing was roto wire and I would write fantasy sports updates for them. I covered the magic and I covered the knicks, but all the way until I was like 28 years old, no one wanted to buy my writing. It was blog spot that it allowed me to write in my own voice and find my own audience and then people started to see, whoa, there are like weird children on the Internet that like Eddie's writing, like he's creating a lane and I talked to my publisher at Random House and they were like, yeah, you created a lane selling books to people who don't buy books, non traditional readers, and so without the Internet, without blogspot, without that ability to just project my voice and hope someone connects like I never would have happened.

Speaker 4:          00:17:02       I know we're living through it in real time, but it is totally radical as a matter of human history that you can reach out, reach around the world and build community with total disregard for geography and find people who like fantasy sports or something like that and and build community around it. That's an extraordinary thing and it has no precedent in human culture

Speaker 1:          00:17:27       and with translation software. Now language is no longer even a barrier. I mean it's changing and shifting as as we speak, new technologies are being developed. I mean Samsung has a phone now that that note eight where you could just highlight something and instantly translated. I mean they have earbuds where you could put that on the pixel where if you talk to me in Spanish, I'll hear it in English and this is crazy stuff and this is all changed.

Speaker 2:          00:17:52       That does for commerce or diplomacy or your ability to talk to me across the table without having a translator in some clunky way. Try to describe what I just said. These things are amazing and you want all of our collective genius to drive them and not have big Cape gatekeepers like our broadband providers in the way.

Speaker 1:          00:18:12       Yeah. It seems to be a real issue and I think that we should look at the internet as something different than almost all other services because it is our ability. It directly affects our ability to evolve as a culture, our ability to exchange information. It's, it's so critical and it's, it's so unprecedented and this is a very powerful thing and you know, people would love to have it go back to the old way and have you get your news on ABC and NBC and CBS and that's it. People would love that because they control you. Sure. I mean, it would be way easier to keep the world, you know, informed in the way that they would like. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:18:53       it will be easier for regulators in Washington too. I mean, there's just disorderly chaos on the internet, but it, it, um, it create it. Listen, it has challenges, but it's unearthed communities and created economic possibility for people like nothing in our history.

Speaker 1:          00:19:10       Yeah. I think it just, it's changing who humans are, you know, I think there's more of an understanding of each other. There's more, there's more compassion. I mean, there's also a lot of hate and there's a lot of anger and there's a lot of. But I think with the bad there's more good yet undoubtedly there's much more good. And to me it feels like a freedom of speech issue, you know, like it's if, if this internet kind of super highways controlled and there's toll booths everywhere and it gets privatized. Like, I mean, I lived in Florida, we didn't have money for roads. I saw when things got privatized, it's you just pay more, you don't have the same service. It's, it's one of those things like it has to be regulated, it has to be protected and it has to be guaranteed as a thing for all human beings. Not even just Americans. Well, it's just, it's stunning to me how many people are against the idea of having an open internet. It's just,

Speaker 2:          00:20:05       well, you know, most of the polling, I think polls are always, you got to be careful, right? Because they can ask a question one way and get an answer. But the best one done was right before our boat by the University of Maryland. 80 three percent of the public supported net neutrality opposed what we were doing.

Speaker 1:          00:20:21       But who are those 17 percent dummies? That's what I want to know. I think anything you can get the American public to agree to at 83 percent is a pretty high. I think it's wonderful, but I'm stunned to meet the 17 percent seriously, but isn't there a bunch of people? I feel like there's some, and I. I wrote about this on twitter recently without judgment. I said that net neutrality seems to me to be one of those ideological issues where if you're on the right, you support it or if you're on the left, rather you support it where you're on the right, you would like to go away. It's almost like totally

Speaker 2:          00:20:57       okay. Can you give you are a Democrat or Republican? You benefit from net neutrality and internet openness. If you're conservative or liberal, if you're a big business or a small business, you benefit from Internet openness and the history of net neutrality is something that doesn't get discussed enough, which is that it began the first time the FCC put net neutrality policy on paper. It was 2005 and I'm old enough to remember that that was when President George W dot Bush was in the White House. In other words, this country's first net neutrality policies were put on paper. One of republican was running the FCC. It is only in recent days. We have characterized this as a left right issue and I think that's a fundamentally a mistake. How did it happen? Like when when object Pi proposed this legislation and passed it, it baffled me. I thought net neutrality was a thing we had all agreed on.

Speaker 2:          00:21:55       It was like, we're never touching this. How did this happen? Well, you know, through a whole bunch of boring Washington procedures whereby they circulate our proposed rulemaking. How did, how did he get the power and leverage to pass this? I think that he was supported by people in Washington, including some broadband providers and was led to believe that with deregulation we would all be better off. And then what? What? What I find interesting is Google, Amazon, facebook, these, these big power players used to be very vocal net neutrality, keep the internet free, things like that. They're not as loud as they used to be. They seem to just be quiet on it. What do you think is going on there? Well, first I want to point out that those big companies through their association are gonna be intervening in the lawsuits in favor of net neutrality.

Speaker 2:          00:22:49       Yeah, so that's true. Yeah. But to me net neutrality has never really been about big companies. It's about who's going to be the next digital platform, who's going to be the next startup and the next player. I'm the big companies can always find ways to build relationships and manage this kind of lack of neutrality online with their leverage that come from size. It's. It's a question of who's going to start something up that you and I may not see because they didn't pay off their broadband provider. It's the entrepreneurship that has me most concerned likes new small business.

Speaker 1:          00:23:22       Yeah, so when I was saying that there's a. seems like an ideological rift. There's certain people that are not very well versed in this issue, that automatically side one way or another. This is a thing that we do in this country culturally, right? Left thing. You see it a lot with global warming. Will you have a conversation with people? They say that global warming's, so natural process, natural cycle of the earth goes through it and he talked to them about how much research they've done on it. It's almost none if they fall into these ideological groups and those pull yourself up by your bootstraps, right wing, you know, there's this sort of conservative way of thinking that the let the market decide and this is that, that conversation. I don't think that's an honest conversation if you're dealing with monopolies in, in regards to Internet access, which I think a lot of and I am and you are, a lot of people are. It's a giant part of living in America.

Speaker 2:          00:24:14       Yeah. And that tribalism that you're describing right now, it's really deteriorating the quality of our dialogue in Washington. We've got to find a way to fix it because, um, we're not going to move ahead without actually having some back and forth on these things.

Speaker 3:          00:24:30       This is like the one issue where I'm like, it actually brings people together. 80 three percent of people support it. Percent. Yeah. It's undeniable. But it. That's what's scary about this country now, is that even when so many of us agree about something, when one very powerful group, a lobby, the broadband companies get behind somebody with some control, like they can push the needle. You know, it's funny if you am I

Speaker 2:          00:24:52       email inbox, which was an explosive thing leading up to this vote was full of people writing and telling me their stories, but a whole bunch of that more like, you know, I'm a registered Republican but I want you to know, or I supported the president, but I believe net neutrality is really important. It was striking to me like once you get out of the talking head types. Yeah, she found is that there was really broad based support for net neutrality.

Speaker 1:          00:25:24       Well, what's stunning about this administration is how trump's administration is just going ham for business. They are going ham for offshore drilling. They're going ham for diminishing state parks and starting to tap into resources, whether it's mining or fracking or keynotes. The world's gonna end in 25 years or something and he's like, just go. Just take it all. Here's the thing. He doesn't have 25 years. Yeah, and so the world is gonna end in 25 years. I mean, if you're a 72 year old guy, how much time do you have left? If you have 25 years, those last 25 years, you're, you know, you're barely there.

Speaker 3:          00:26:01       Yeah, it's insane. There's nothing going to be left after this administration.

Speaker 1:          00:26:05       Well, it's real weird. It's because it lets you know, like people used to think, wow, the president is that much power. Look at what's happening. Yeah. There's, there's a, a giant shift in environmental policies. Environmental Protection Agency has been gutted is that's the scary stuff. The scary stuff is how much emphasis is placed on business and how little on the world in which we live. I mean, we have to balance that out. It's also

Speaker 2:          00:26:28       how we got to focus on the future, right? Yes. It is not a given that we're going to succeed in everything. If we don't start planning and when I think about the world my kids are going to inherit, it's going to be digital. They're going to be consequences.

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       Why don't we start doing something about that right now? There's not a lot of urgency. It's one of the weirdest parts of being a person as people look so short term and they always feel like someone's gonna fix it. You know? I mean, isn't that the, the attitudes som was going to fix bulger right now. The economy's booming. Java's test is at all time low and they'll just start throwing all the good stuff your way. But yeah. Well, when you just start raping the environment and the business has go, hey, as a lot of process, a profit to be made here, let's, uh, let's get going. Let's start hiring some people. Yeah. It's like all the money goes to defense and Department of Education is good at department of Energy has gutted department of Environment's all these things are gutted. Everything that has to do with art, even present and future, it's good at the, the only thing that's going on in his business and defense.

Speaker 5:          00:27:32       And what's the argument for that? The argument for that is that as business booms, as the economy will be trickled down and they'll be more opportunities for businesses to clean up the environment and profit off of it and yeah, but it's never work. Commissioner, can you like trickle down? Economics has never worked in the history of the history. I have my doubts about it. Yeah. Yeah. I've heard every pro and con for it. It's it, it. I think at the very least the trump administration and I'm trying to look at it through rose colored glasses is a fascinating experiment and in so many different ways, but it's also I think made us all more conscious of our role as citizens. Yes. People have to talk back to Washington. They have to speak up. We need our representatives to hear what people think and I think we got a little comfortable there.

Speaker 5:          00:28:25       Believe in the system just runs by itself, but it does better when people participate and I think that there's a lot more demanded of us now as citizens no matter where you fall on the political spectrum. I think it woke us all up to that fact. Besides just calling state reps, senators, what else can people do? Um, uh, participate in letter writing campaigns, get things in your editorial page, you know, I don't mean a big papers. I wrote something for the La Times about this awhile ago, but um, I mean in your, your local papers, tell them why it's important. Tell them how you built a business using online activities and how maybe going forward that's going to be a little harder. I think I'm making efforts to make sure that people understand this at a local level is really powerful. What's very disturbing to people that 320 million people can view how many we have 3:20, somewhere in there that, that can be affected by five people. It's crazy, right? It's insane. Five unelected bureaucrats because look, that's who we are. Have this extraordinary power over what we can watch. So he hear and learn.

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       I think that um, there's something in that that strikes me is not right. And the idea that in the end, just three of them voted to roll back this open.

Speaker 1:          00:29:52       So three people changed it for $320 million people. That's crazy. That doesn't seem like the end three people by the way, who were not voted in. So they're unelected, which was bananas. I mean, there's no question about it. That's a terrible idea. Like if you gave people the option, he said, hey, do you think that five people should be able to decide whether or not the 320 million plus plus the rest of the world really? Because if you're a super podcast gets cut off, you know, you're not gonna be able to reach the Canada either. Who Do you think that they should be able to stop access to? Information people define slide

Speaker 4:          00:30:29       83 percent of the American public to it's. It's insane and that's the type of shit that makes me feel trapped in this country sometimes because we did an elect these people, you know? Yeah. I think. I think you gotta make a choice which is you got to choose to be optimistic because it's the only force multiplier we have, which is you're going to decide that if something's not right, you're going to call, you're going to write letters, you're going to write editorials that you're to build campaigns around things because in the end that's the only way to change things and if all of us felt a little of that spirit, Gosh, today, if not every day, I think that that would make extraordinary difference and we're already seeing its impact in Washington. There are more people showing up in the capital city for votes for marches.

Speaker 4:          00:31:18       There are more people reaching out to their members of Congress than ever before and I just think we're going to have to sustain that energy if we want to create some real change. I think it's about more people who have an opinion of values that are trustworthy in the community running. I think more people need to run because for awhile we've. I've actually looked at government as something like I may be, could never be part of. This is a totally different thing, like I just, I, I researched the candidates and I go vote and that's, that's my interaction with it, but I'm starting to realize that even if you don't want to run or even if you want to run it, it's a possibility and you number one, you can encourage your other friends to go run and you can look at who is trying to start campaigns.

Speaker 4:          00:32:01       Like I'm 35 now and, and Dara friends from law school. Then they're like, hey, I'm thinking about running, you know, like I want to throw a fundraiser, who should I speak to? And then you know, there's a guy that I played basketball within a basketball league. He was like, I'm going to try to run for governor of California. I'm like, good luck, but like I'm going to follow what you're doing and I think more people need to run. But if you're not running, hold the people that are running responsible, ask the difficult questions like be a part of the kind of vetting of that candidate and be hands on in the process of that person's candidacy. Are you running for president with Oprah? No, no, no. I'm not running mind. Thing is, is that,

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       you know, I think we all need to have a stake in the cats that are running in and ask the questions that need to be asked because you know, I've been one of the people that just shows up maybe two weeks before the election, two weeks before the deadline of like the, the absentee ballot and I go research for two weeks and I go check out all the pros and cons of each candidate and after two weeks I decide, but you know, I should be involved more than that. I said as it announce your congressional run right here. Right now. I'm too busy. I'm too busy. This is not the problem though. The people that we would want to run for president or whatever, elected official oftentimes are too busy. I mean, I think if you ran. I mean I'm not really clean up. You could really do it.

Speaker 5:          00:33:22       I'm not running. You got a bigger platform than I do. I'm interested in. I just, I don't see important though. You find a way to participate in public life and give back whether you run or support someone or encourage your friends and they don't have to be the person who was the student council president in high school. Muslim people out there. My thing with candidates say, great, so joe, we've had disagreements on the show. We disagree about certain things. We just screwed up. Well, it was a. It was the minimum. A university changed my mind based. By the way I changed. There was a knee jerk reaction to you. We've talked about this. I was talking about universal basic income and net neutrality was sorta nerdy, nerdy about ubi. I think you automatically, knee jerk goes, ah, don't do that. It's bad for human nature.

Speaker 5:          00:34:10       You give people money, they get lazy, but then I thought about. I said, no, you're just giving them food and shelter. You give people food and shelter. You're still leaving open ambition and you're also freeing them up for the possibility of perhaps exploring things that they would really truly love to do where they have, and I think when we, when we started dealing with automated vehicles, automated trucks and trucking and shipping and driving is a giant business. It's a huge part of what people have to like. There's some extraordinary percentage of men who drive for a living and if you eliminate that, you're going to have a lot of people out of work. You have. We have automation that's coming to factories and all these different places. It's going to eliminate the need for humans cut out all the human error or what are we going to do with all those people and what are we gonna do with all those jobs and how do you give these people this newfound possibility, this, this, this avenue for exploring new potential career paths.

Speaker 5:          00:35:08       What will the best way is have their money taken care of in terms of like food and shelter, like have given them the freedom to explore ideas? Yeah, because it's a benefit a lot of people have and then they do work and you take that stress off their plate, but I talked about the conversation because we had it. We had a good discussion about it and then it went on for weeks on twitter. We kept talking and then we both kind of came around on on things and I was like, Yo, this is great and when I think about candidates, I think about I would vote for somebody who they're

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       going to stick to their guns and they're gonna do what they said they would and their values aren't going to change once they go to DC. That's all you can ask for from a person. Be honest about who you are and be who you are when you go to DC,

Speaker 1:          00:35:51       future of civilization, right? Like where are we now and where this insane change that we've experienced over the last 20 years because of the Internet. What is, what is it going to be like in 20 years from now? And what happens to the average person, the average human being. We have this idea that you're supposed to show up nine to five for a job and that's what you do and then you work until you're retired, but that's all something that people invented. I mean there's all of. This is a new thing in terms of human history. This is not the only way human beings can live and the idea that this is the only way to use our tax money or resources is the way we're doing it currently. That doesn't seem to be that logical and I would like people to have more opportunity to innovate and create and more freedom where they don't feel shackled down. Like there's a lot of people out there that just feel shackled down by just the need to feed themselves and survive.

Speaker 3:          00:36:48       Yeah. And also just even school, like I started reading and listening to these podcasts about sleep. Right. And it's a. it's a scientific thing. Some people are not morning people. She's laughing, but like reading or listening to podcasts about sleep, you will. You could get information at Somnia listening to pat. No, but I listened to this dude and he was talking about like it's a scientific thing. Some people are on a different body rhythm, they just don't do well in the morning and he looked at schools in the school schedule and the school schedule is based on mom and dad's. They have a nine to five based on traffic and let's try to get these kids into school for high school. The earliest. Then middle school later than elementary school after that and some people because they're morning people did just suck at such a disadvantage and highschool, college.

Speaker 3:          00:37:36       This is like kind of an educational industrial complex. If you don't fit in, if you're not cookie cutter and the way your body and your mind works, you're not going to be successful. And and speaking of what Joe's talking about is I think I genuinely believe like even some of the silliest people I've met, everybody has some sort of genius it. We're just not like fostering the unearthing of that and like, look, there's some. There's some hilarious stuff that happens at Bauhaus at the restaurant, but I tell myself every time I'm like, all right, like this guy totally messed up making this bow. This guy totally messed up. Butchering this chicken blake. Find a place where he can succeed, like put him in a position to win and that's a lot of responsibility. It's a lot of responsibility. It doesn't always work out, but. But usually it does. Usually you find out like, you know what? That guy's really good at making the sauce, you know, like put them on the sauce. Like you have to find a place where people to be successful, but our society have to find their own funding.

Speaker 1:          00:38:33       Yeah. The problem is if you do have a nine to five job and you're trying to feed yourself and get along, you're going to have less chances to innovate. You're going to left, left chances to take risky decisions and just try things out.

Speaker 2:          00:38:46       That is why Internet openness is so important though, because this was a platform and a space for you to go experiment, build community, find communities, figure out what your genius might involve, which may not be what you're doing at work every day. And I think the idea that Washington is mucking around with that is just crazy. Well, I definitely don't think they liked the fact that people have this ability. I definitely think if you could, if the people who created the Internet knew what they were doing when they release this on the general public, they probably wouldn't have liked to give people the kind of access to information and the ability to change things. What we've seen through Arab spring, we've seen through so many different cultures that are using this to change the way they interact with each other. You know, it was interesting during our net neutrality proceeding, Tim Berners Lee, who um, uh, invented the web and vint cerf who invented the Internet along with some real icons from early days like Mitchell Baker from Mozilla all wrote us and said, do not change these rules. And it seems like when you've got that incredible genius of these people who created this connected world for you and told you that this agency in Washington, it's going to really mess around with it. It strikes me that, um, we should have listened.

Speaker 1:          00:40:08       Well, we definitely should have listened, but we also shouldn't have this place where five people get to make this decision. It's insane.

Speaker 3:          00:40:14       Yeah. Going in what you just said, Joe, it's like even even like, let's say my role at, at, just to explain it from my role as the owner or manager at the restaurant is not necessarily always my job to create a role for somebody in find a way for them to be successful in my restaurant. I'm hiring a cook, I'm hiring a manager. Like this is the job description. Hopefully if you're coming for this job, you can do this. Right? And I think what you said really opened some in my mind, which is the government should not be always prescriptive about like, all right, we're all going to go to school at 7:00. You're going to study hard and you're going to get these grades. You're going to go to college, like that's not a path to success for everybody, but what it should do is enable people to be creative and find out what works for them. We need to give people the freedom to contribute to society.

Speaker 1:          00:41:01       Well, I think we're trying to manage the masses without looking at the needs and the ideas of the individual and everybody has their own likes and dislikes and creative kinks and things that mean how many people could have lived a life of misery but got lucky somewhere along the line and found something that they love and, and pursued that. And I think that there's not a whole lot of guidance in that regard, but what there is on the Internet is examples of other people have done this and you can connect with those people and you can. There's so many communities when it comes to. I mean to. I'm not, I'm don't. I'm weird about stuff. I, uh, I liked knifemaking make knives. It's kind of ominous, but. No, no, no, no. The craft of it. I love the idea of forging things. I just think I find that fascinating and I follow like dozens of these guys on instagram that make knives and hatchets and metal work and tools and furniture and shit. I'm not making furniture. I have no desire to make furniture. I'm not even thinking about it, but I like watching this and I like watching these people communicate with each other and explain the methods and the techniques they use and this is a, you know, an avenue where a young kid could see something like that and go, I want to make furniture. Like that seems like a cool thing. Like look at this amazing

Speaker 2:          00:42:33       that is too, like when you were growing up, you wanted to do that. You're going to go to some library and go to that close to it and look things up. You would never see the video content that the number of people doing that at all. It's so casually and quickly legitimizes it for you as something to think about two or pursue. That's amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:42:56       Yeah. I had A. I had a knife made out of meteor. It's made out of media. How? How hard is media steel? It's metal, it's iron. Oh Wow. They make it with the iron that came out of a media. The mousy fire arts made it for me. How did you cop media? I've contacted them. I contacted him and I, I, well I knew there's a guy named Steve Kramer that makes somebody made one for Anthony Bourdain and uh, and I want what he got out. One of those. He's got a fucking meteor knife. How do I get to meet your knife? So my kitchen knife is made from a media. Damn. Yeah. Cleopatras and was made by that time. Got a step by my knife. Game up because I just, I still just use the cleaver man. I'm so like ancient Chinese with my chopping. Just to cleaver.

Speaker 1:          00:43:44       Well it's not the wrong with a cleveland. This is, it just looks cool because I know it came from bad. I could, yeah. No, I could expand the arsenal. Adam, media chef's knife to tell everyone that came from a meteor when they come into your kitchen. So you just sort of impressive. He showed it to a couple of people. I just got it recently, but it's a, I just, I think that this new world of, uh, of the Internet in terms of like is the ability to explore these communities and like you said, video, like see the video of someone like this clock, this a russell bill made this clock for us, that the grandfather clock. I mean, that dude made that all of the metal. He welded it all, put it all together. I mean this, this kind of stuff to me is so fascinating and I don't just like it because I'm interested in the craft of it all. I like it because I see it as an opportunity for people to get out of the grind. Like you can make things if you can make things and sell things. If you have an Internet connection and you have an instagram account which is free and you have an iphone, you take your phone, you film something, you

Speaker 4:          00:44:47       next thing you know you're selling things. I mean, we, it's an incredible time for like opportunity to escape. The biggest lie people fall for is that they're, they're bad at something or they're not valuable. It's like you may be bad in this structural definition of a human being that goes to school and gets a nine to five job. I was terrible. I was terrible at it. Yeah. I got fired from a Boston market. I got fired from the waterworks like I couldn't work anywhere. I got fired as a landscaper. People's lawns. I couldn't do anything, but then it's like when you become in control of your own shit and you go do what you're passionate about, it's like, well then I became successful and I try to tell people all the time, like, if this doesn't work for you, the straight and narrow, it doesn't work for you.

Speaker 4:          00:45:31       Like think of a way to think about what you think your strengths are and play to that. Don't let anyone tell you you're a failure. You're unsuccessful because you don't fit. The stereotype I think is really important though for successful people like yourself to tell their failure stories. We don't do that enough. Well, I mean I lost a restaurant because I sold all. You can drink four Loko like that was like I went out in flames. You can drink for local sounds like a liability when you're good at telling stories, but I think that that's true. Generally, I feel like I wish I could ask every member of Congress to tell a failure story. They would never do that. Those people are trying to pretend they're something different. Well, I was a terrible law student. Anything more explosive like before you ever sell for local at a lemonade stand? I can tell you I absolutely never did that and probably never will. Any other failures? Uh, yeah. I got some parenting failures that I'm going to save my children from announcing in public

Speaker 1:          00:46:30       call. Good call. Yeah. I feel like it's important for people to relate, right? They have to be able to say, oh, Eddie wasn't always a successful guy. Like he was a 19 year old kid wants to. That was also struggling. That's very important. It's very, it's. I think it's one of the most important things that people can understand that failure is an opportunity to learn and that horrible feeling of failure is really your friend. Does that horrible feeling motivates you to change?

Speaker 4:          00:47:02       I mean I feel all the time I played basketball yesterday. We had a double header. I was, I was cooking on a grill. I was making lamb skewers for four hours in the morning when straight from the kitchen to this basketball game and San Gabriel valley playing with. It's like an Asian basketball league. So I'm actually like kind of toll like um, like a small forward and there's like little younger dudes at 25 running around me. I did not have played well the first game I was washed the second game and these kids probably like 23, four years

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       old running past me, elbowing me and I got so mad and I act it out. I started like yelling at them. I started like beefing and I got home and I told my fiance about it and she's like, Yo, why are you beefing with these kids? They're 25, like, like your old. Of course they're gonna run by you, you playing a double header and you came out of the kitchen. And it was funny because I was like not willing to let it go. But then I was like, I got to work on myself like every single day, like I fail at something and I failed at being like the elder statesmen in the basketball. We're being composed, being composed. I lost my composure and I started making fun of these kids for no reason. And I was like, that's not me. You know, like basketball sometimes brings out the worst in me, but I was like, all right, today I'm going to be a better person. We'll go back to that week, next week I'm gonna be like a nice dude. And if some kid washes me in west me in the face, it gets fine. Well

Speaker 1:          00:48:20       Times you just need to experience it so that you know, okay, I just have to be more composed when that comes up and when you didn't expect to experience it. And then someone hits you with that elbow, you're like, what? Fuck you man. And the next thing you know, it's intense

Speaker 3:          00:48:32       boxing, basketball, it's the most like sports system. Most humbling thing for me. I'm not built for it. I kind of built to fail at sport, but you try anyway. I try because I try because it's the thing I'm the worst at,

Speaker 1:          00:48:46       so I always wanted. Well, it's great for the mind. The thing about sports is you're forcing your body to do things that are uncomfortable and in doing that you're not just exercising your body. You're also exercising your mind and that's one of the things that I always try to relate to people that are negative about physical exercise and exertion because they think that it's some sort of a frivolous venture that's just vanity. Just want to look good or use your body, but there's a mental aspect to having the ability to push through discomfort that is extremely valuable and if you don't have that switch where you can be comfortable being uncomfortable because you've done it a million times. If you don't, then you're. You're gonna be panicky. You're going to be weirded out by it, and that is a mental weakness. So in that ability to push through discomfort helps you not just in physical exercise and exertion, but it also helps you in work. I'll give you have to push through certain work things instead of getting up and getting another cup of coffee, figuring out what the fuck you're doing, figure out what, what's this problem you're working on? Concentrate like focus you get out, get after it. Be comfortable being uncomfortable.

Speaker 3:          00:49:53       I don't believe in trickle down economics, but I believe in trickle down mental strength, you know what I mean? I start in the gym every morning and like whatever happens in the gym, it humbles me. It gives me like, you know, some kind of like energy and I bring that throughout the day. Like what got you hooked in Jujitsu?

Speaker 1:          00:50:11       Well, I've done martial arts since I was a little kid, but I think there's something that is inescapable in my life at least, and that is that there is no disconnect between the mind, the body, that they're all one thing and that you can work them individually but not really because when you working your body, you need the mind to do that. The intensity of my workouts is one of the most important aspects of it and that's fuel 100 percent by my mind. It's not by my body

Speaker 4:          00:50:36       and Plato said that since fifth century, he always wrote about like how training the body is just as important as training

Speaker 1:          00:50:42       the rest of your martial arts. I mean it's just, it's everything because your high level problem solving with bad physical consequences, you're, you're trying to avoid injury and humiliation and all these various things that are a part of martial arts and in the meantime you're trying to maintain composure under pressure and you're tired and you have to understand the ability to push and push through discomfort and push through exhaustion, but it also fuels the mind. It's very important.

Speaker 4:          00:51:14       Yeah. Fighting that three round fight. I was like my first three round fight. I got so scared. I was shaking the whole time, but I just told myself, dude, there's no backing out in the ring. You have to go forward. Keep going forward. And like just out of fear. I'm a pressure fighter. Do you mean like just out of fear, like I have to be a pressure fighter because I don't think in my first fight I knew I did not have like the in me to counter or or do what like the game plan was. I was like, I just have to pressure like I have these hands and move these feet. But then I got through. I got lumped up a few times. I won the fight, but I was like, whoa. I feel like I could do anything now. And so now I keep sparring and I keep fighting because I, if I can be composed in the ring with someone trying to kill me, then like I, I can be composed on a podcast or in a meeting or negotiation. It's, it's the best. Martial arts

Speaker 1:          00:52:04       is a vehicle for developing your human potential. Then that those things are all connected and it's a, it's a critical lesson for, for young people and if you can push through hard workouts, you could push through whatever career path you want. You're trying

Speaker 4:          00:52:19       breaches me respect too because it's like you can get bodied anytime you can get dropped at any time, like be grateful for when you have both arms and legs and you're standing on your two feet because you could be dropped at any second. So. But I mean, do, do you do physical activities? Sports? Yeah, I know she'd been waiting to jump in this conversation. Well, I grew up in new England in cold country. Where? In Connecticut? Connecticut. Outside of Hartford. Okay. You're one of those people, is that. It's like a westport and I think my girls from the westport in New York City. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. She from West Florida. So I grew up skiing all the time and uh, I still love skiing. I still, I need the thrill of flying off of something that makes me uncomfortable in order to relax in a perverse way. So when I have vacations, that's what I do. I take my kids who right now live in DC with me and it's pretty flat there. So you got to go take them to see some mountains and you got to go make sure that they go down something that's a little bit too steep every single time because I. You build some

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       resilience when you get down something like that and you turn around and say, well I did that. I can do some other things. I think there's some resilience in living in Connecticut too cold, weird and plus it's not really a state. Connecticut's like a highway between New York and Boston now I would. Connecticut, Connecticut, Rhode Island, California. People if you're not crossing. Oh, I married someone and grew up in Boston. Boston, Boston have ideas. I never would have thought you were from Boston where I was born in New Jersey, but I grew up in Boston, got rid of it, hurt myself on tv when I was 19 and I was like, fuck that accent.

Speaker 5:          00:54:16       So embarrassed. Listen to my own accent. Go home and I hear people with New England accent and it feels like sweet and comforting. It's great putting drunk there was drunk. It seems like it's normal. Can you do. Can you do a little bit of one right now? Uh, I could see. I thought you like listening to the Utah. I thought you were from the south for a second. No, no, because you don't have a new England accent. No, no, no, but I've been living in Washington for a little while. Plus she's a politician. You got to get rid of the shit. You have the ill politician like the meter talking.

Speaker 5:          00:54:53       It's on like a metronome smooth. It's good. It's good. It's a good thing. Do you ever. Do you ever do this thing with your hands? Like Clinton used to do the thing where you hold your phone like that do this thing what we need to do in this country. I never understood that. People would always tell me when I do voiceover, like slow down, slow down and like I can't slow down. My voice totally changes. If I slow down, I just got to come, like shot out of the case. True. If you go back to Washington, you decide with your congressional campaign, it's all going to happen. You are going to slow down when you speak. Yeah. Like you can hear your periods and commas. I just run through sentences with trump as president. I think all bets are off. I think you do whatever you want.

Speaker 5:          00:55:36       No, I don't think there's any rules can call into other countries. Shitholes. You can get crazy. Joel. I'm telling you. I really think you should run. You can bring mad people together. What does that mean? I'd use you bring people together and also like I think number one. Number one, like I think you're one of the few dudes who can get the like really wild white people to like think about things like consider them. Be Like have some perspective and empathy. Like the wildlings internet walk. Yeah. I, I really believe it. Joe, as the guy that's like, alright, the crazies trust him and then like he, he, he can get them to think about things from a different perspective. I don't know if that's good. No, it's a good thing dude. Like you appeal to you appeal to like all people but like,

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       like I meet a lot of people, they run up on me like, Yo, you're on Jerry. You're pretty left. You're a little, you're a little crazy, but I enjoyed talking to you and I'm like, Yo, thank you man. Like I, I mean I come on the show so I can speak to a different audience than just like, you know, hip hop, Asian dudes in my dms dudes that like Migos and soy sauce, like it's not that big niche. There's a weird thing about the listeners of this podcast. If they don't, they're not left or right. No, it was like a weird mixture of people, but that's good. That's so much more of that country right now. I mean we're, we're not gonna, we're not gonna do things if we don't start listening to each other. Like I don't usually identify as left his people call me that. But it's like your content on the show galvanizes cats from like all around around the

Speaker 1:          00:57:12       world. Well, I, I don't identify as left either, but I do when it comes to so many issues when it comes to gay rights, when it comes to civil rights, when it comes to just across the board things that you would automatically consider liberal, but also the freedom to express yourself. Like that's, that to me is the marketplace of free ideas is one of the most important aspects of developing a civilization. It's one of the most important ways that we understand about each other and you got to have an open mind. It's like I was saying like you bring up that universal basic income and I was like, get the fuck out of here with that. And then I thought about it afterwards and I was like, maybe there's some, maybe I, I always liked to explore my reactions to things and if I had a reaction to something and I automatically dismiss it, I go, okay, was that valid or did I just dismiss it?

Speaker 1:          00:58:05       Because it's easier than to have a nuanced perspective that's formed over time and a lot of critical thinking. And so I stopped and thought about it all and I think at the very least it's something that merits consideration and maybe it could be a of some sort of a project. Let's go. Let's see. Let's see if that works. Yeah, we have some countries doing that right now though. They're different than us culturally. And I think culturally as part of it, that is a problem. Well, America is just so based on competition. Competition is so powerful over here and I think that's good. And I also think that's bad because ultimately it's like if you could grab trump and and, and get him on mushrooms and lead, explain just somehow or another let the universe explained to him, this is a temporary experience. You're trying to gather up all this money and gather up all these resources and gather up all this influence when this is all fleeting. It's sand, it's slips between your fingers. There's no way you can grasp it for real. The real experience is the shared moments that we have with each other and the more we can enhance that for the people around us, the more you can use your power to enhance people's perspective,

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       change people's way of interfacing with this world that we live in and we recognize that we're all just living together. We're all just a part of this community, this competition thing. Most of the competition is with yourself, most of it, the vast majority of it, and those other people that you're competing with, you should cherish them because their fuel, all those people, instead of looking at them as the enemy, those people are your friends. Although your most bitter rivals are the greatest motivators you're ever going to experience. Those are the people that are going to push you, but don't be toxic about it. Yeah, you can be. You can be. You can be peaceful about it. Yet Joe, I love competition because it's number one. It's amazing to watch like, you know, low, uh, Klitschko Anthony, Joshua, I think greatest fighter like the last 20 years, like hazing, boxing, match for that boxing match, Loma Chenko, Reagan's.

Speaker 5:          01:00:20       That's not competition, you know, like that. That was, that's an experienced though. That's, that's an experience. Total diss snatching. Have a soul. Well, he's a different animal. Loma Cenk goes a different thing. The Matrix. Do you know the story about his dad? Would his dad made him do know, made him stop boxing and do a Ukrainian dance for four years. That's why he's got that ridiculous footwork because footwork is everything. And I know he does a number association too, which is crazy. But what I was saying about competition is like, you know, Pete piloting and was we need competition. We need competition. Like, but who is competing with service providers? There is no competition. It's just beating up on a bomb. You know, it's like we all live to watch great competition, but you have to foster competitors. You need actual competitors for there to be competent.

Speaker 5:          01:01:08       Imagine if what we're experiencing with Internet was also with food. Imagine if like only certain people could bring you your food. Yeah. You know like, Oh, you live in Charleston. Yeah, you gotta get your food from Mike. Yet it's basically like growing up eating food in Orlando. There's like one in a category of food for your mind. Yeah. Food for your mind is real. I mean the fuel that you get them, the information that you get from the Internet, that is fuel for your mind and whether you get it in the form of actual food or whether you get it in the form of information. These are both very critical things that you need a wide variety of different sources for, but you bring up a good point. Even just, let's say food delivery, right? It started off, you would call the restaurants and it was difficult.

Speaker 5:          01:01:53       You had to save the menu from every restaurant. Then seamless comes around and they're like, all right, we're putting all the menus on here and we're just helping facilitate. You get things from the restaurant, but it wasn't like for restaurants we didn't necessarily like seamless because then you had to have your own delivery workforce. They took a big cut of what you were making and in a lot of restaurants they didn't even break even using seamless, so then like places like caviar came around and postmates came around and they supply the service, the delivery people, the consumer pays more for the delivery and the restaurant makes their money and it's like, whoa. Now that actually created competition between delivery services. Now you have an evolution and now you know everybody gets what they want. You get service all happened over the Internet. It was all kind of little little folded menu, the kitchen drawer, right?

Speaker 5:          01:02:44       Like that's how we used to do it and if you lived in New York you get home and it's just like 20 Sushi, making empire, putting something under my door, a lot of slip and fall in your own apartment cases from those wickets. What happened and what's happened through the Internet in terms of people not drinking and driving because of Uber. That's changed the way people get around. If I went to high school with Uber, I would have been good. When. When? When were you in front of the comedy store? Lift is blocking the Goddamn driveway to the comedy store. Nine out of 10 times when you're allowed to leave. There's a car pulled up there which is, look, it's, it's an inconvenience, but man, it's so nice to see drunk people just getting driven around. They need to be. They may be jumping around. It's interesting.

Speaker 5:          01:03:32       We don't talk a lot about the safety element of that, but it's so amazing. It's also young people are not buying cars like they used to. Used to be that getting a car entailed your freedom. Right. And one more device centric where you go and what you do with virtual physical car anymore. You were segregated because I went to a school where people were bused in from different parts so you could be friends with someone at school, but if they don't have a car or they live 45 minutes, you can't be friends, but now you can all meet each other up. You can, they, you know, they may not be able to rent the car or have a car, but they can take uber and meet you up. Yeah. And that really is another aspect of the Internet that a lot of times we don't take into consideration is cellular, mobile apps, apps are the Internet.

Speaker 5:          01:04:17       I mean it is everything through the Internet, but it's in this little device that you keep in your pocket and twitter, facebook and instagram and all these different live in a mobile first world. Anyone who's building a website now, it should be built for that device because that's the first place most people experience that online. And the only concern that I have about that though is that, you know, ultimately we want people to not just be digital consumers but to be digital creators. And some people think more of us should be. I don't, I don't think people building things should be, you know, a bunch of guys in hoodies in their twenties. I think that, no, I agree with the digital world should look as diverse as all of us. Yeah, sure. I hope on a going forward basis, we're going to fix this internet situation with net neutrality.

Speaker 5:          01:05:10       And we're also going to diversify the universe of people who build things for our online more. Well, we really see that in the podcast world. The podcast world is extremely diverse. There's so many different Po. I mean whatever you're into, you can find a category and a whole shitload of people that are making podcasts about it and it's really sad. Five podcasts on sleeping. You probably haven't done a ton on food, right? Food food is actually, when I was working on this net neutrality should I have worked with the today show and they wanted to find someone who built a business online and they spent time with this woman, I think it was Laura's kitchen and she had basically started just putting videos on Youtube, showing herself and how she was cooking and then you know, that morphed over time into a book and a big empire and she built something from it and it's amazing.

Speaker 5:          01:06:01       If you look at how much cooking has evolved from just hobby online to actual business, it's extraordinary. It's undeniable. I mean for, for younger people listening, they're, oh, they're probably just like guys, we know like the, like everything. It's, it's undoubted. Everything happens on the Internet and so for it to become this thing that's not regulated is insane. It's like it's like getting our roads taken away. You don't want like regulation, which you want is just a little bit of oversight to make sure that it's fair. I think that's a good way to put it because I don't. I think when we break in a regulation or deregulation, we lose the point. The point is you just want a little oversight to make sure it's fair and open to all equal playing ground in that everybody's allowed to come to this and recognize it as an important resource that it is.

Speaker 5:          01:06:47       The ability to distribute information is critical to changing the culture, the way we interface with each other, the way we talk, the experiences that we share, the way we have access to all these new ideas and information. It's just shifting things that this radical warp speed, warp speed, warp speed, it's just. It's the weirdest time ever and so for this to be a monkey wrench thrown into the gears of this by five people, three shoes, three, sorry, present company. Yes. It's just, it's, it's hard to imagine that that's going to stick, but with this administration, it's not stunning because it seems like net neutrality being dissolved favors these big businesses that would like to maximize their profits. And Net neutrality is the ultimate populist issue, right? Because it empowers all of us online. So. Yeah. So. So write letters, make calls, be annoying. You have to be annoying. Run, run, run for president in 2020 Eddie and Oprah. Eddie, Joe, Joe, and Joe's a good ticket, bro. I'm not doing it, but good luck. Good luck. You and Oprah. I think you're going to be living your best life. What's that mean? What does oprah appraisal? Oh my bad boy. Oprah. Is that part of the secret? You're going to have to work with your running mate on that.

Speaker 1:          01:08:17       So, um, this

Speaker 2:          01:08:20       w,

Speaker 1:          01:08:20       the situation that we're in right now, do you, are you confident that there is real potential for it to be reversed?

Speaker 2:          01:08:28       I am optimistic that the American public are awoke and they're paying attention now and they're making a Ruckus. I mean, we had millions of people write us at the FCC when I got appointed to the FCC, I didn't think millions of people knew what the FCC was. I think that's extraordinary and I'm not ready to give up.

Speaker 1:          01:08:48       Well, the last time the FCC was in the mainstream news is when you guys were finding Howard Stern. That predates my tough course. Does that was also during the George Bush administration. How'd you get to the FCC?

Speaker 2:          01:09:01       So before I was appointed, I served as counsel to the Senate Commerce Committee and um, I worked there for Senator Rockefeller for a long time and first senator in a way before that. And um, so I, I got like a front row seat at a whole bunch of digital issues with how we deal with our wireless spectrum, how we change our television technology. So, you know, I'm a real kind of nerdy Washington thing, but also a new way to see how everything is changing in our economy because of digitization. What's your thoughts on cryptocurrencies? I'm, you know, so I have no special authority on this except that have microphones in front of me. Um, that being said, yeah, right. Uh, I'm less interested in cryptocurrencies than I am in Blockchain, which is the ledger that they use to re to record exchanges in cryptocurrency. It's anonymous and it can be used by anyone.

Speaker 2:          01:10:07       It's extremely low cost and I think they're open questions about how you can make government and a lot of business services more efficient using blockchain that I think are really interesting and I have yet to be explored. That's what I'm excited about. What's one way a business could use blockchain? Um, I'll just make this up. Say there's some kind of a, you export fruit. Someone puts a bag of that fruit on the table and they say, well, we know that there are certain fields that fruit comes from, you know, there might be a disease in it. How can you figure out how that fruit got here from the field? You know, you can go back through your supply chain and call everyone and get them to tell you how long it sat over here and who held it and put it in the truck. The question is, if you can come up with a digital way where everyone as a collective just contributes to that along the way, can that be low cost? More efficient and more effective? I think it will change supply chain economics in a really big way and we don't fully understand the consequences for our economy yet, but I think it's coming. Oh, that, that makes sense. Kind of like a wikipedia

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       for each thing. Yeah. Did it with food for you? So. No, no, no, no, no. That makes sense. That makes a lot of sense. No dogs. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:11:22       Um, I, you look at, here's, here's high, high level nerd, but our airwaves around us, right? Our wireless airwaves, that power, all of our phones, we have to divide them up. You don't see it, but it's like if there's a zone so that your phone works, the television works, all of these things, you know, but we also have a whole bunch of airwaves that are only used sometimes, but what if we could create like secondary and tertiary rights to use them so that our phones were more powerful. And what if the best way to do that was to use something like blockchain. I mean there's, there's so many ways I think the recording ledger for cryptocurrencies could make our economy more efficient and more powerful. And so that's what I'm interested in and that's probably because I don't own any bitcoin. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:12:04       I know people also in journalism have been talking about keeping articles on blockchain so they, like Internet articles don't go anywhere, you know, because people can just erase a website, like a website, uh, goes out of business. Then all of the articles on that website are gone. So some people are putting websites on Jean,

Speaker 2:          01:12:22       figuring out how we maintain our history in this digital world is actually, it's a real thing.

Speaker 1:          01:12:28       Yeah. Yeah. Especially a lot about that. It's like cultural preservation, right? If we have some sort of a solar flare and it kills the grid and we lose hard drives and we there, that's real. That actually could be a real thing. Yeah, and blockchain. It's kind of an answer from keeping information. My hope is that we're going to eventually shift to voting online.

Speaker 2:          01:12:52       Does it do that, do that? I think the state of Oregon that makes experiments with that, we should study that. We should make voting easier.

Speaker 1:          01:13:02       Yes. That's what it comes down to and make it more convenient for people, but then the thought is, well, if they're so stupid, lazy, they can't make their way to a voting booth. Do we really want their opinion to be expressed? I think the busiest politician we talked about politics, just let us know you have a job.

Speaker 2:          01:13:25       If you've got kids you're trying to work there for now and then you find out your polling place is open from nine to five. Right. That's a good point. It's insulting. I mean, I know that when I voted in the election, the last election, presidential election, I think you can guess the last election in Washington, I had to wait 35 minutes before I got in, in the middle of my day also. So that's, that's, that's a commitment. It's a commitment I'm willing to make. It's a commitment. I'm privileged enough to take that time and make it. We got to make it easier.

Speaker 1:          01:13:54       I'm absolutely joking around and I really do think that we should make it much easier to vote and I think you should be registered to vote the same way you're registered to drive. I mean if you have a driver's license, I think you should be registered to vote. I think it should be just that easy and I think you should be able to do it online and I think if you have a social security number, you should be able to vote. I think it should be

Speaker 5:          01:14:11       really using and I think that's not outside the realm of possibility. I think we're, we're operating on these antiquated systems and we've accepted them as fact and this is the way things are and I just think that it's nonsense. It's not a good system. Totally. Yeah. I mean like if you live in Florida. I remember when I was trying to vote in Florida, like the polling stations were in churches and I'd go and it was, it was an uncomfortable thing to go to a church where I'm pretty much the only Chinese guy voting, you know, a lot of people say really wild things to you in mind. Like when you're waiting to vote. And I'm like, I would have to vote online. Like when they say, well you probably go on for the carry, Huh? You know what I mean? Because it's like the John Kerry year for carry and it's not your business bro, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:14:56       But also I'm like, why do I have to go vote at a church? Like I don't go to this church. Peanut gets so intense when it comes to voting comes struggle as are super intense and you know, they, they, you know, people just say things to you in a voting line and I'm like, this discourages a lot of people that may have a minority opinion in the neighborhood. I think you should have some sort of an understanding about what you're voting for. Two, I mean I, I would like voting to be much easier, but I would also like there to be some accountability. Like you should know what you're actually voting. Maybe there should be like some sort of a quick online poll or some sort of a quick online candidates. I think that violates the constitution. So I'm just going to say that does it.

Speaker 5:          01:15:38       The constitution has nothing to do with the Internet. No, nothing back then. The constitutional meaning like old ass shit. I don't know. I don't want to test for voting. I think we're just expressing the frustration where like a lot of people just get ushered in like sheep to go vote for people. I think you're expressing that. You want there to be accountability. Yes. And you want people to be aware, I would like people to know what they're voting about. Participation. You could answer what your vote if you understand it, you know, like maybe there's a, some sort of, uh, an amendment that's being passed or something's being passed where you don't understand exactly what you're getting into and maybe there should be a way that we find out if you understand it, I know that you have the good intentions for it. But I read these cases that once you have a test for people to vote, I mean the powers that be.

Speaker 5:          01:16:30       I mean look at Gerrymandering, you know, like it's, anytime you introduce that it, it always sets like the populace back. But I do, I do really connect with joe sentiment, which is like a lot of people voting aren't, aren't actually participating consciously in the process. Yeah. I mean, listen, I think being a citizens of job, you actually spend some time and think about what's your authorizing for the world, what the future's going to look like and how you're going to participate in shaping it merely by voting I think. I think it's a real job and I think more people are aware of that now than they used to be. It's also, there's so much to pay attention to. It is every time lasting, right is when the elections come around and you just realize all the different things that are up and you just go over all the different issues and all the different possibilities and you're like, Oh God, yeah, I know what I did in California last time.

Speaker 5:          01:17:24       Like all the propositions are like, whoa, this is interesting. I actually an interesting, but the local stuff is really important. We spent so much time talking about national elections, people who around you who really have power to change your life, your most local representatives and sometimes I worry that we pay the least amount of tension to those races. Oh yeah. We dropped down the street and you see some guys got a sign on his lawn for some dude running for some shit you didn't even know was up. It was like, is he a politician or a realtor? How many people do they even need to win one of those elections? Yeah. That's where you start, Eddie. That's where you start your empire. San Gabriel Valley. Yeah. Before you run, you're the vice president with Oprah. That's what you gotta do. I can't do it, man. I can't do get a car.

Speaker 5:          01:18:12       Everyone gets a basic income. Everyone is 60 g's 60. That's what the universal. If you can't get 30, 30, 30, 32. What we settled on was 30 last time. Thirty. Thirty. Seems like you could get by. Yeah. Yeah. You're not going to get rich. You're going to get by. Which is good. Thirty five. I think 30 is a good place to start trying it out in some place with 12 once a month to 50 a week. Thirty is good with some like alright. If you do get a job and you make some money, were you really paying some taxes? You know? Interesting. There was a way that automation is not going to hit the economy at the same time or all sectors of the economy at the same time in the same way. So I think it's coming faster than we think. Not that I'm wishing for this.

Speaker 5:          01:18:59       I just think it it, it is because my stocks and robotics keep going up that. That's my evidence. Well, Elon Musk is fairly convinced that universal basic incomes, the way to go, he thinks that in the future that's just going to be inevitable because there's going to be so many things that are automated. Just can be so many people that are out of work. Yeah. Although I think it will change our conception of work, what we do to be productive individuals. People work too much. That's for sure. I agree. I think people would work way too much. You know what I mean? You're live and then you're dead and you have a heart attack when you're 60. Is that really what we're doing? I mean, isn't there a better way? Well, how about working three days a week, you know, or four days a week for three off.

Speaker 5:          01:19:42       Four on. That seems reasonable. I work seven, but it's love so I don't feel like it's work, but none of my stuff actually. I mean, how many days would you do the podcast? I do it a lot, but I have other jobs. Yeah. You stand up and do the UFC commentary. I do, but none of them are jobs. Same. This is barely. I love it. You know, but also you're your own boss, which is, which makes work way different. Makes it different things very different than it is for most people. Yes. Yeah. That's what I want most people to escape. I want them to escape the grind of having to be somewhere because someone tells you have to have to do something because someone tells you you have to do it. Yeah. Getting a small amount of money. Why other people make more? I just think that the economy

Speaker 2:          01:20:26       always changing. I mean, it used to be that you were, um, there was an employer with many employees. I think increasingly we're all gonna be, um, the employee with many employers in that we're going to have a web of contracts and activities that we use to sustain ourselves economically over time. I think you saw that developing the Internet and the new platforms that are coming on board. Um, there's consequences of that for healthcare and other issues that I don't think we fully tackled. But I think that there is change coming that lifetime employment and preparing for it with a single degree out of high school is I think something that is going to look like a historical moment

Speaker 5:          01:21:09       in the future. You know, there's a johnny naysayers out there that I always get frustrated by it. They were like, yeah man, not everybody can do that. Not everybody can work for themselves. Not. Guess what? We're not talking to everybody. If you're not capable, that's okay. But there's a lot of people out there that are capable. They just aren't doing it. Yeah, they're scared. Yeah. And they don't have to be. Because we were all scared. Everybody was scared and it seemed like comfort and, and, and having some sort of security, it's a real, a real need that a lot of people have that confidence, security and knowing that your bill is going to be paid and everything's going to be taken care of. That's, that's a, that's hard for people to shake off. Yeah. Comfort is also a huge weakness. I think at times, like a lot of times, you know, if you're too comfortable, you become complacent, like challenges, failures, like that's where I really start to examine myself and I'm like, it might be better tomorrow. Growth in comfort. Don't go together. Yeah, yeah. Um, for anybody. Yeah. But then people get families and then when you get families you don't want to take any risks. That's, that's a problem as well. People have mortgages and children and they, they don't want to do anything that might put them in the unemployment line.

Speaker 2:          01:22:23       To be clear. That can be a really smart and responsible choice at some point when you have a lot of people relying on you, that's the most rational thing do.

Speaker 5:          01:22:32       Yeah. That's a real problem. Like a Black Jack Dealer told me last week, scared money, don't make money. You say I go try and double down, double down, double down. I'm showing a four. How did that bag? He pulled a seven. I got screwed because that's why you go to Vegas. I told them, I was like, this is why come to vegas to lose money. Well, yeah. Well, yeah. And you lose money and I had to tell everyone at the table's, I'm like professional gambling, that's what we're here for. Like if you, if you hit on 17 then always hit on 70. If you hit on 16 then or if you stay on 16 stout 16. Bromley plus practice professional gambling professional gambling's not on 17 though. Right? That's if they're showing, they're showing like if they're showing a face card, some people hit. I mean, no, not 70.

Speaker 5:          01:23:19       What I was saying. 16. I'm at 16. I said the wrong thing. Like I always stay on 16. Even if they're showing a face card, I'm like I just stay on 16. Really? Yeah. I'm conservative but then I'll double down. Double down. You have the, the hit on 17. That's those wild white people you were talking to are the people we need you to turn there listening. Cowboys. People listen. They're listening. Yeah. Uh. All right. I guess we probably should wrap this up. Jessica, tell everybody what your um, your twitter handle is [inaudible]. It's J. Rosenworcel. Spell my last name. Uh, so that's at j. r o s e n w o r c e l and m. So your advice is people should do the old fashioned thing. Make those phone calls. My advice is make a Ruckus make rocking without a little noise. This is one of those times and I think being a citizen requires us all to speak up right now.

Speaker 5:          01:24:22       Make a Ruckus online as well. Let people know. And your social media, your facebook, twitter, all that jazz. And getting the pornhub comments. Hashtag that neutrality. Yeah, that's not what she says. What I said, I can't believe you leave comments. I can't believe I know somebody leaves comments. So, um, uh, Mr. Eddie Wong on twitter and instagram as well. Same thing. Same thing man. Thank you brother. Thanks for putting this together. I really appreciate it. It's very important when people talk about this stuff. Thank you Jessica for being here. Appreciate it. And thank you everybody for listening. All right, thanks Joe.
