Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. Right. And then you can't trust if you're are 80 80 year old billionaire, you can't trust a girl who's willing to fuck you with tapes, exact test. So then it's like a lot of like, it's like three people fucking up.

Speaker 2:          00:15          You know what I thought was the most bizarre about all of it? Um, apparently I was correct and that what she is as far as the most recent story is that she was supposed to record his saying his conversations because he would say things and then forgot he sat him. Right. So He's, he's got, he's dementia 81 years old, these old as fuck. So he would say crazy things and then she would record them and you know, and let him know like what he said. Right. Well in this case, somehow or another, it got leaked how it got leaked to speculation, but he knew he was being recorded. Right. That is true.

Speaker 1:          00:53          So you can't, it's against the law, the record, anyone like what if they don't say anything and it's just bathroom noises and stuff. It's against the law still. Even if they don't talk in it. Absolutely. In California, they don't know about it. It's against the law. You're not allowed to record. The essence can be like if you just put a tape recorder down behind the toilet, they don't say a word. They just, you know, and then they leave. That's still against a law even though they don't say it. It said they're just their spirit being in the room.

Speaker 2:          01:17          The noises of them, um, being recorded are actual physical presence being marked by the sound of their feet. I think that's probably illegal.

Speaker 3:          01:25          Really? Yeah. That's why they used to tape crank and criminal. So I said he guilty as fuck. He's like, if you take a tape and put it in behind the toilets in Bourbon, whatever, whatever, and the girl might happen to be a stripper, whatever, whatever. That combination is never gonna happen. But if it did, it's just they know that you were recording her pooping. It's interesting because I guess so the recording like no, no, Brian, that's an interesting fucking spaces. Interesting. When we talk about that you clam up when you're like, oh, you can't require people pooping.

Speaker 2:          02:02          The real issue with putting all of your eggs in one basket and that basket being athletics and especially athletics, especially combat athletics, the idea that you're going to have some sort of a long and successful fruitful career by throwing your bones and another person trying to separate themselves from their consciousness. That's quite ridiculous because just the very act of doing it in preparing for that very active to the amount of damage that your body and your brain even endures is. But we have this idea in our heads that you know, a guy has to be an undefeated champion and you know, my son's going to be a champion someday. Like, man, if you're really lucky, your son won't be a champion. If you're really lucky, your son will learn the valuable lessons of martial arts as far as like character development and the as far as your ability to overcome what seemed to be unsurmountable obstacle, but to become a champion, you have to be a crazy person. Yeah. You have to be crazy person who's obsessed with nothing but that and that will take over your life.

Speaker 4:          03:06          Yeah. And I feel like having worked Avi obviously with people like that, you know, shadowed them and recognizing that mindset. Um, uh, I, you know, and I find too, like there's just some point at which like there's some gifts that are just bestowed by genetics or something and it didn't matter how hard you work, you're not going to quite get to that. Maybe that level that separates the real and you won't know that until you hit it. You know what I mean? You're not going to know that wall until you run into it. And I feel like for some people, like I was talking to one guy, just a guy at the gym and, and uh, he said something more or less like the best that he, he ever felt in a fight was when he was up against someone he knew was better than him.

Speaker 4:          03:49          And he knew he was going to lose. And if they fought a hundred times, he'd lose a hundred times. But he packed guy, he made that guy see something about himself. He got that close to him that the other guys sorta recognize. I'm a frail. I made out of the same crumbling stuff that he's made out of. And so, you know, sort of pierce that teflon armor that, that I think some fighters carry around with themselves and he's like, that's, that's all I could do. That for me is the victory. I still lost. But I made that guide, discover something about himself that he hadn't discovered up until that point because he'd never been tested to the point that I got to. I was not able to test them. And I thought that's another part about just being, recognizing what you're able to do, you know, and it may not be beating them, but it's you, you find some other measure of success

Speaker 5:          04:33          you

Speaker 2:          04:34          eat. First of all, you being a veteran and you, you being unabashed in your love for soldiers and your respect for your, your, your fellow military members. When you got on top of that cage and after, you know, they were all cheering and you were yelling out to all those people that you loved them. I mean this is all off camera man. We had cut to commercial and you're on top of the cage and you're just yelling and all those people let them know that you love them. That's some intense intense shit.

Speaker 5:          05:03          Yeah. Overwhelming emotional near shutdown. Yeah. I'm walking out to the cage and I see this dude, he flies for the one 60th, which is like the special forces wing of aviation. The last time I saw that dude was us handing him my shot buddy. You know, I'm like, it's a big thing in special forces community. We're real tight. You know, like I'm handing him my brother that has bullet holes in him and, and um, and I'm like, I don't want to let him go. And he's like, Hey, I got this. This is what I do. You go do what you're supposed to do and get back to work. That was the last time I saw this dude was handing him my buddy on a medivac. Then I'm walking out of the cage. I was like, Holy Shit, there is that dude from the one 60th that I handed my shot buddy to. Totally overwhelming. I have to go in there and fight and then uh, you know, Nice Fifth Special Forces group is co located there. So I saw a bunch of dudes from like the Green Baret regiment. Yeah. It was entirely

Speaker 2:          05:58          too much emotion. I just want to be like curl up and cry. Yeah. It's a completely different kind of, there's you on top of the cage up there in that, that photo. That's just an intense, intense picture. That picture should be framed and on your wall somewhere because that is one of the greatest pictures of every scene. And you could cut me out and just have the dude. No, no, no, no, no. You need to be in there for reference. Yeah, I mean, but that's your attitude. What you just said, cut me out and leave the dude's that there really is your attitude. You, you really don't want that. You, you were saying while you were up there that my job is, is in here is easy. What you guys do, you guys are my heroes. Yup. You know, memory. Yeah. I remember everything. It's disturbing. Scary. Don't get a fight with Joe Rogan verbally.

Speaker 6:          06:42          Okay.
