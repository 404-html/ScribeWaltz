Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Donta.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:00:05       and we're back. What's up buddy tan really and joined the southern California weather, sir, my biggest problem everyday is to decide which beach between La and San Diego to hit. Would you bragging, bragging about your lacks problems? My privileged life, you're brown privilege, like Brown privilege. It's like a bronze. It's a very bronze shine. In a few days it'll settle in and that's when the true glory of God comes up. Ah, I bet your, your vitamin D levels are at an all time high. I need to take them in for the Montreal winters. Right. Do you supplement and when you were in the winter in Montreal, you don't died a hundred percent vitamin D's. It's a critical factor or I'd just come back to do your show in the winter and then that's how I got myself. I don't think that's enough. I need that vitamin D, that's a big thing with the, apparently with people that live in Seattle in the winter is taking vitamin D and even sun tanning beds.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       People don't realize it's sun tanning beds, although it's kind of counterintuitive. You think they're really bad for you? It's actually not that bad for you. As long as you don't burn yourself. It's actually good. I did a study a while, a paper, I wrote it. This was a theoretical paper with a dermatologist a few years ago where we looked at some evolutionary explanations for the epidemiology of suntanning. So if I were to ask her, not without you knowing anything about it or not much about evolutionary theory, who do you, what's the typical demographic of the sort of obsessive Santana [inaudible] what? Well women, young, bright, single. And they usually tend to discount the future consequences for the immediate benefits. Right? Right. So the smoking cigarettes, they probably smoke. Exactly. So it doesn't matter whether I'll get my window when I'm 73 I'm going tonight to the Party and Tony might be there and I'd like to, and so we, so, so with this, this dermatologist friend of mine had written to me, he was doing his fellowship and he said, look, I've got, as part of my research requirements, I'd have to write a paper, can I, you know, you're the big researcher.

Speaker 1:          00:02:04       Can I do a paper with you? I said, but you're a dermatologist. What can we talk about? And then I thought, well, let's do the evolutionary roots of suntanning and there. And that's how that paper came to be is how was that evolutionary though? What's evolutionary about white girls that don't think about the future? Well, no, it's, it's, are there particular ways that we can predict the demographics of people who do certain behaviors? So for example, pathological gambling. Who Do you think is likely to succumb to that affliction? Pathological gambling. I would say, uh, men are with men, adult men in their thirties. Low status, low status on average. Okay. And the reason is because it's, it's, it's one of a multitude of strategies to acquire resources, right? It's the same reason that men, rob banks, not women. And so you could, okay, let's do another one.

Speaker 1:          00:02:54       Eating disorders. Who Do you think it's, it comes to eating disorders? More anorexia Nervosa in particular. Okay. Women limit. Now typically the social science explanation is old, just due to exposure to media images, right at that turns out to be a laughably false premise. Why is it laughable? So here we go. Here's the evolutionary angle. Okay. Hippocrates, founder of modern medicine 2000 plus years ago had documented the exact same epidemiology of eating disorder disorders in women. So it certainly can't be because of media, right? So there, there must be something biological that explains the sex specificity of these different, uh, you know, dark side consumption. And so the evolutionary perspective is to then look at to the extent that these human universals manifest themselves in exactly the same way across time and place. What might be some of these biological drivers, compulsive buying almost exclusively women, 90% women, uh, pornographic addictions, almost exclusively male.

Speaker 1:          00:03:57       And let's just stick with this one. Let's just stick with this one. The anorexia Nervosa. First of all, when you're talking about hippocrates, you're talking about one lone individual, so completely anecdotal piece of evidence and he said that women were throwing up at a status symbol back then for women to be overweight. So it actually, it's, it's a good question. Uh, eating disorders are much more likely to occur in cultures of plenty, right? Precisely. Because the argument is that you can shut off your reproductive window today because when, what happens when you, so here's the evolutionary angle. When you, when you suffer from eating disorder, the first thing that happens physiologically is you get what's called [inaudible] Arabia. Primary Laminaria is where you haven't had your mentees yet and now they don't come out. They don't, there's no onsite and recycle. Yeah. Did you say menzies? Your mentees?

Speaker 1:          00:04:45       Yeah. Is that, is that like the technical term for it? It's the, it's the fancy term for it. Yeah. MNCS, everyone said it sounds like something a little kid would call it mommy, I didn't get my mentees. Well, uh, now secondary amenorrhea is where you already had your menstrual cycle and then it's shut off once you become, once you have anorexia Nervosa. Okay. Well what happens when you have an erection when you have avenue area is that you, you know, your, your reproductive potential shut off. Right? And so what evolutionary scientists have found is that it turns out that when women suffer from Anorexia Nervosa, there is some environmental trigger that they're being exposed to Co. Rightly so or wrongly so that they think they should shut off their mentees. They reproductive potential for a better future. You can see what I'm saying. Whoa. So, and, and let me, let me give you the background to this.

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       There's a model called the reproductive suppression model, found an other mammalian species that's say a cow. Okay. So if you take a cow, what would be the biggest environmental threat that it faces other than predators? What would you think about tainted water or food or just how much food she can have? Right. Cause she had access to enough calories to sustain her gestational period. Right. Well it turns out that in in Mammalian species, a wide range of movie alien species. Somehow there was a mechanism in evolutionary mechanism that either causes the females of the species to either shut off they reproductive window or if they're already pregnant. And then there's an environmental input that says, Hey, this is not looking good. What do you think happens to their body? What did they do with the video board? The fetus, they abort the fetus. And now postnatally you have infanticide.

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       So in this case you have the child, but you realize for whatever environmental reason that it's not going to be fruitful to raise that child and you buy where you fall. You see it in human cultures where typically the one who was killed as the last born as you would expect because the other children now you've invested quite a bit in them. And so if you're going to get rid of some of your genetic package, you get rid of the one that you've invested Leeson. So all of these mechanisms that are part of something called the reproductive suppression model, the idea is that eating disorders is a special instanciation of that because what the eating disorder is doing, it's shutting off your reproductive potential because you're getting amenorrhea, right? But is that absolutely connected to why women get anorexic? Because it could easily be just a side effect of them wanting to be ridiculously skinny like it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:09       Like I would understand with a cow, with something that's living in a very wild life, a wild world, you know, this animal out there just eating grass and when resources are depleted, like nature kicks in. But, but there's no conscious decision making process when a woman is deciding to be anorexic. At least there's some form of decision making process that wants her to lean towards a slimmer physique. So that speaks to a very interesting distinction. And so bear with me as I set it up. Okay. There's something in evolutionary theory known as proximate versus ultimate explanations, proximity. And actually that speaks to the article that I had sent you. That's one of the points that I discussed in that article. Proximate explanations and science. Explain the how and the what of something much of science operates at the approximate level. If you want to explain what diabetes is exactly, physiologically speaking, you'll explain it at the approximate level.

Speaker 1:          00:08:03       The ultimate explanation is the Darwinian why, why would something have evolved to be of that form? So let's discuss it in relation to something related to eating disorders. Pregnancies taken us, right? So pregnancy sickness is a phenomenon that women experience around the world. That's a universal phenomenon found in all cultures. Uh, approximate explanation might be, or approximately exploration might be, how do shifts in a woman's, uh, estrogen levels affect the severity of her symptoms? That's approximate question. The ultimate question is why have women evolved that physiological response before I give the answer? Can you guess what that might be? Why do they develop that ultimate response? So why is it that women experience Prek? The, I call it pregnancy sickness, but I mean the typical colloquial term is morning sickness, but some women don't experience it in the morning. I have no idea why. Tell me why you ready.

Speaker 1:          00:08:59       Yeah. So pregnancy sickness happens during the first trimester of gestation during a period called organogenesis. This is when the fetus is developing its main organs during that particular period. It's particularly important that the women not be exposed to food pathogens teratogens that might harm the developmental pathway of the fetus is organs. Therefore, all of the mechanisms that she experiences attraction to certain foods, pickles, up, repulsion from other foods. Uh, the feeling of feeling, uh, you know, being nauseous, the throwing up, all of those built in mechanisms are evolved mechanisms that are meant to protect possibly the fetus from being exposed to teratogens and it's perfectly timed so that once organogenesis ends, that's when the pregnancy sips symptoms. And so the difference between proximate and ultimate, it's not that one is a better explanation than the other is that you need both levels of explanations to perfectly understand something.

Speaker 1:          00:10:05       Well that makes total sense, but it doesn't necessarily apply to why women become anorexic because the desire to be slim, to look very thin in public is very strong because of social media or media rather. Uh, the depictions of women, they're always almost impossibly slam. And then on top of that, they also had photoshop to it. Right. So in the, in the, the evolutionary explanation to the eating disorder story is there is something in the environment that the woman in question is thinking is a threat to her. Could you think the same thing as the cow felt for the lack of calories? Can you think in the human context? What might be such a threat? Do you see what I'm saying? So what? I don't know. What would be such a salt, for example, if you feel rightly or wrongly, right? It doesn't. It doesn't matter whether they objectively it's true or not.

Speaker 1:          00:10:55       Whatever she feels is what the reality is, right? If she feels that there isn't going to be sufficient either can support, extended, can support when she raises the child or the most likely thing is partner support. If she feels that there isn't likely to be a good partner who's going to support her since we are by parental species, then she engages at and shutting down her reproductive window. Hence what you said is true at the proximate level, right? Her thinking can become this disordered so that she actually looks at herself in the mirror even though she's only 70 pounds and she still thinks that she's fat, but that's approximate explanation. But the explanation that I've given you is the ultimate Darwinian white. Together they make a full, complete explanation of the phenomenon. So it doesn't occur in people that have very healthy relationships with a spouse or it occurs much more rarely.

Speaker 1:          00:11:51       Much more rare. Exactly. So the research shows, the evolutionary research shows that the environmental threats equivalent to lacking of grazing area for the cow is lack of extended, can support or made support to the woman. Does that makes sense? That makes sense. Because it is primarily single women, right? That they'd have anorexia and that's why, by the way, you see it in cultures of plenti rather than an Ethiopia because you would expect that the woman who shuts off her reproductive potential today, it's because she's hoping that in some future state things will be better for her to get back on the reproductive train. When you're in Ethiopia. I don't have a chance to shut off my reproductive potential. I need to get the food tomorrow, I'm going to die. Right. Wow. Interesting. But that still doesn't cover is hippocrates. Hippocrates is just one guy who, right.

Speaker 1:          00:12:45       Who had a sufficient database at the time to, uh, describe the findings in very similar farms to the current ones. What I'm saying basically is that if it's were that it's due to media images then well he didn't have media and it just at that time. Right. I mean so how would it be that an ancient Greece, it is also the case that is only women who experienced an erection or votes. What did he describe? What was he talking about? I mean the specifics, I don't know. So I haven't read the, the original, it's kind of managing, I don't know. I mean cause I'm just aren't like ancient depictions of women. Like it's desirable for them to be overweight. Right. It depends on the culture. I mean the usual universal that we typically talk of in terms of body types is that it'd be an hourglass figure, which actually is going to speak to the second point.

Speaker 1:          00:13:33       That other paper that I send you, so an evolutionary theory. What we do typically is we build what are called neurological networks of cumulative evidence. In other words, when you're trying to make an evolutionary argument, it's you don't just come up with a post hoc story as some people who don't understand evolutionary theory like to say that, oh, we just concoct these post hoc speculative evolutionary stories. As a matter of fact, the evidentiary threshold that evolutionists typically seek to achieve is actually very high. So let's take the hourglass figure for example. Okay, so what is some data that would convince people that men have evolved the pension for the hourglass figure? So let's go through some of these. You Ready? Okay. What is some data? Yeah. So in other words, if I wanted to convince you unequivocally of the adaptive argument, the evolutionary argument as to why men might prefer the hourglass figure so that they should have bigger hips, it would make it easier for her to breed larger fat deposits in the breasts in the ass.

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       It makes it healthier. She has fat storing for she's, she'll have healthy offspring. Okay, so let me jump in. So if you had medical and reproductive data that shows that women who have that particular body type are more likely to conceive, then that would be one check and we have it. Yeah. Then we might look for human universals of that preference. In other words, we don't simply use data from Ucla undergrads to tell us what types of body types would prefer. We go to the animal, more tribe in the Amazon and ask them what type of body types they prefer and so on. So if you then demonstrate the universality of that preference, that's another check. Now we could look at art data. You, you pointed to some of the depictions so we can ask Ruben. We can look at data from ancient Greece, from ancient Egypt, the pharaohs and so on from Africa, from India, and we could take the statues from those cultures spanning several thousand years and do a content analysis of the statues and show that they, they come very close to that hourglass figure we could take, if that's not enough data, this one's going to clinch it for you.

Speaker 1:          00:15:34       But there's many others that I could give you. You could take congenitally blind men, these are men who have never had the gift of sight. And you could show haptically through touch that they prefer women that have the hourglass figure, which, which immediately negates the possibility that it's due to the fact that they were taught those preferences through the media. And so you systematically collect data from multiple converging lines of evidence where that that data becomes overwhelming, it becomes unassailable. And that's how you built an adaptive argument. So contrary to all the guys who say, oh, evolution has just come up with these cute post-hoc stories, we're actually profoundly more meticulous and a situation. And the data that we collect well is that really been established that so many men prefer soft, mushy, hourglass type figures is deposed too hard bodied women? How many women are you letting these blind guys grope?

Speaker 1:          00:16:35       It's like, are they getting a real study sample to choose from or like how's that? I like it. Good. We got it. Well, the p the, the particular data with the congenital blind men, I think they only had maybe two or three mannequins. Mannequins. Wait a minute. Okay. So you're letting them feel up mannequins. So all the day that I gave you is not enough. Now you're going to attack me mannequin style. He got it. Okay. How about, can't you bring up strippers? I mean, how do you, why do you have to have a mannequin? Well, because probably it might be difficult to have the, uh, ethics approval board of universities have young, a young blind men or maybe they're not young feel off a bunch of women. Yes. The ethics board doesn't like science because you can't just judge what a guy likes and women by you letting them touch a doll, that's ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:17:22       But let's shit science. Okay, well isn't that look every, every study has some methodological constraints, right? That one's easy to fix by having real women being fest. I'm sure a lot of women would sign up for that. Okay, well maybe. Maybe. Why didn't they try that? That seems so that you can tell by the way that I'm not misspeaking. I hope that they did use mannequins and let's find out what's the name of the study at Jimmy. We'll look at the 2010 he just do congenital blind men and waist to hip ratios and it'll come up. It'll come up on the Jamie Board of truth, the Jamie Bode of truth, Aka the Internet, by the way. You could, you could take Fmr, righ, right? Brain imaging studies of men that are exposed to women of different waist to hip ratios and their pleasure centers in their brain light up more when exposed to women that have that hourglass figure.

Speaker 1:          00:18:13       So again, the data is unassailable because it comes from multitude of countries, multitude of time periods using different methods. I'm not denying that men enjoy that. What I'm saying is that that Saturday was study. Yeah. By using hourglass figures on the mannequins. So let me, let me build on that. I, I in one of my papers, I looked at sex dolls, right? Sex Doll, convenient money. I have to look at sex dolls for a paper, right? Uh, so anyways, in that paper I just went to, I can't remember the company's name. It's, it's a real dog. Probably one of those, was it a like a realistic one? I mean, I didn't get them at home and measured them. They don't mean one that looks like that person looks like a person and they advertise their measurements. Okay. And as you would expect, the average waist to hip, their hair color changes in their skin color changes. But the average waist to hip ratio was close to that 0.7. And so here what you're demonstrating is that marketers, right, these guys that are producing these products are producing products that are aligned with our evolve preferences. If they didn't do that, if they produced a sex dolls that look like east German female slash male swimmers, it's not going to work. Well. It's not going to say, how dare you. Those are women, I think. How are we going to get into the intersex debate from the Olympics? Is that what we're doing?

Speaker 3:          00:19:33       Um, well the Olympics is a fascinating place to jump off with that, but no. Um, so I think, okay. The atomy anatomy of desire, uh, the two mannequins stood side by side, blah, blah, blah. Cargo van mobile vans. Yeah. Okay. Mannequins. Yeah, it's just two mannequins. It's a shit study. They could have easily gotten strippers published in one of the top science journals, but okay, well I'm still still publish it all day. It's, I'm fucking mannequin. Why would they, you can get real women. All right. I'll speak to them. The only the way that it would be rude. Well, even the woman who was like not chosen, well you don't know. I mean, some, some guys might be like in petite, slim, slender model type. Well, that's what's interesting to me is that men aren't really attracted to that model shape. No. Yeah. It's weird cause women oftentimes think that men are, because they see these models in these magazines and I think that does lean towards the desire for some women to get into that anorexic state because he's sort of get this body dysmorphia thing going on by looking at these, uh, almost a completely unrealistic to pictures.

Speaker 3:          00:20:39       I mean, I know people were actually built like that, but they're extremely rare. Right? It's like knowing someone who's built like a professional basketball player, they absolutely exist.

Speaker 1:          00:20:47       But boy, good luck finding one on a random day, finding some seven foot tall super athlete. Right? Yeah. No, I agree. Uh, there's all sorts of differences between what images that you see sometimes and what people truly prefer. I think it's really strange how women always say want to paint it as women being victimized by these unrealistic body images. But you never hear the same from men when it comes to body builders, right? When men see a guy who's just giant muscles that had big six pack and just looks like a stud. Men never feel like they're being victimized by these unrealistic body on, right? I mean most of the guys that you see as leading men on average tend to be taller than the norm. Right? So I'm being victimized cause I'm a shorter guy as if you don't, if you forgive me for saying as you are, right.

Speaker 1:          00:21:36       So how come we don't complain about, you know, short guys and he'd love as well? Or how about social status? Right? Typically you see the six, the depiction say in romance novels. I've given this example on previous occasions. I'm not sure if I did on your show, but if you, if you studied the archetype of masculinity in a romance novel, they'll look, fabio, it's long hair. It's exact same guy, right? He's tall, he's account and he's a neurosurgeon. He's rough. He's reckless in terms of his risk taking. He can only be tamed by the love of this one woman. He wrestles alligators on his chest, uh, on a six pack, right? He's usually not a pear shape. How many of these books you've read and Man, I'm reading them every single day. I just read one before I came here. It looks so deep. But the reality is that that you know the product works because there is a commonality to what women fantasize about, right? And whether she's Romanian or Nigerian or Japanese, she likely prefers a high status tall alpha male to a nasal pear shaped a wimp. And, and so that's how you describe yourself. How rude I am. I am the walking Alpha male side.

Speaker 1:          00:22:42       I could call you son cause you're a bit younger than me. We slightly plus I've got gray hair so maybe I can get away with that appellation. But no look up products that work well are typically those that are congruent with our human nature. Right? And those that are not will typically fail. I've always wondered why women claim victim status when they're, they're being compared to unrealistic body images, but men don't because I think that just kind of relates to social justice warriors. I've proposed the theory of Munchhausen Syndrome. Have you heard me talk about this? I don't know what it is. Yeah, so Munchhausen's syndrome for those, for the viewers who don't know is this, you know, you get sympathy and attention by being victim and so you feign an illness to get attention. Munchhausen Syndrome by proxy is when you hurt someone else was in your care, typically an elderly person or a pet or typically your biological child because that will garn you garner you empathy points at well, so then to answer your question, why do women do that?

Speaker 1:          00:23:39       Because some women ultimately I trapped and they sort of big Munchhausen a love fest where I need to constantly get reaffirmation and empathy by being the victim. To the extent that Western women, you know, have been liberated from all of the typical problems that we see in other parts of the world. I've got to look for a new victim narrative and boom, that's a good one. Well, isn't it also though that it is an unrealistic body shape and that they do feel it completely. It's like a completely impossible task for a lot of women who were built like normal people. Have you seen the body shapes of a male superheroes and toys? Yeah, like Mason, they let me shoot. That's right. They look at you. So what about the rest of us that don't look like you? How come we don't go into a fetal position?

Speaker 1:          00:24:23       I'm asking why did, why is Munchhausen Syndrome more apparent in women than it is in men? Incidentally in the true form of much housing, in terms of harming a child, it's usually always the biological mother. So you're exactly right. So it's just a manifestation of that phenomenon in a new context. So you're exactly right. That's interesting. But I wouldn't have phrased it that way. I would phrase it more of a term of frustration then some sort of a psychological disorder. I would think that women are just frustrated with this seat. One of the differences being that if a woman is large boned or la, you know, she has a wide waist or something like that, there's very little she can do to try to achieve that model shape. Whereas if a man, uh, is slight, he can lift weights and you know, eat a lot of food and go get a personal trainer and do a lot of squats and dead lifts and build his body up, right?

Speaker 1:          00:25:12       Like a man can make his body look more masculine. It's very difficult outside of surgery for a woman to change the shape of her body. She can get in shape and if she's overweight she can diminish that. She can lose some fat. She can, you know, put some meat on her butt and her legs and, but she can't like grow breasts, you know, she can't, she can't do anything that would make her appear more outwardly feminine. You know what I'm saying? By the way, that exactly speaks to some of the antipathy that people feel towards evolutionary psychology. I mean, you hit the, the nail the nail on the head yet because there is wrongly saw, there's this idea that evolutionary theories sort of biological determinism, right? If people prefer facially symmetric faces, and if my face is not facially symmetric, then I'm doomed to a life of twiddling my thumbs and the life of celibacy.

Speaker 1:          00:26:04       Right. And that's why there's this narrative that became famous with Naomi Wolf. I don't know what, do you know who that is? He, she wrote a book that sold, I don't know how many millions of copies called the beauty myth, which I actually critique. And my first book I talked about the myth about the beauty myth and the beauty myth. Basically she, she provides it this liberatory argument against these beauty standards. And here's her argument, which I will sort of summarize very quickly. She basically says, look, women are now winning in every facet of life. And the only place that men can still cause harm to women that they could still dominate women. And this is going to speak to one of the points that you raised is by creating this false

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       narrative about the types of women that men prefer. And by pushing this narrative, it makes women feel insecure about themselves. Whoa, hold on. That's so her proposal is that the only reason that this exists is because men are trying to harm women. It's a conspiratorial theory. That's hilarious. She must be a lot of fun to hang out with. She's not, she's still alive. She's alive. Yeah. Yeah. She's, yeah. She's reasonably young and still very productive. Uh, but you know, again, it's, it's a, it's a message that sells because if I am a unattractive, if genetically speaking, uh, I don't score well on some of these universal metrics of beauty, I would much rather hear a story that basically says, oh, it's all due to arbitrary construction of beauty standards. It's not, there's nothing innate about these. Right. I think there's a lot of women that are very intelligent that run into asshole men so many times that they developed this distorted perception of what a man is.

Speaker 4:          00:27:41       And so they can formulate this theory and feel justified in doing so. Is it just ran into so many weak bitches out there that they start thinking that all men are trying to harm them. Right. And all men are trying to hurt their feelings. Right. And that this, this theory is valid in her eyes because it's based on the anecdotal evidence that she's acquired through her whole life of running it. I mean, obviously she's very intelligent. She's writing books. She's probably far more intelligent than most of the men she's coming in contact with. And so she's formulated this theory based on her own personal evidence, protect her own ego or you're saying, yeah, but there's direct, there's a direct connection. Like as a man, there is a huge difference in how you, uh, you react how your body feels when you're around a classically attractive woman.

Speaker 4:          00:28:25       Like let's classkick attractive like Sofia wren in her prime, like when you're around it, you'd just go, Jesus, like your hands would get sweaty, your heart would start beating it start freaking out. It is 100% natural and there's, there's no like, uh, oh I want to enforce this because it will make other women feel like shit like that. That is not it. There is a real genetic propensity and it doesn't it seem as though that should be so trivially the now to accept, right? I mean it's, but it's not for someone who's an empowered woman who doesn't see any way of achieving the right. So if you don't, it's like a man could do steroids and live weights and become a giant body builder type dude if that's what he was really into. And you could achieve that through time and effort, but it can be done.

Speaker 4:          00:29:12       But for a woman to look like one of those women, it's impossible. If you are not built like that, you are not built like that. And that's how it goes. So I'll tell you a quick story that I discussed in one of my other books. It was a documentary that I had watched on speed dating. I think it was where there was a, you know, profoundly overweight woman, I don't know, 500 pounds. It was basically arguing that, you know, it's unfair that all these men at this speed dating event are not paying closer attention to her. Okay, that's fair. It's unfair because they're, they've been taught, they've to internalize all these arbitrary sexist standards of beauty. So she was really sorry. Yeah, yeah. Now, but listen to this. So on the one hand if you're unattracted to an overly overtly overweight woman, then you are a fattest.

Speaker 4:          00:30:02       But on the other hand doesn't, this is the other side of the coin. If you prefer very overweight women, then there's the narrative that you are fetishizing our, you know, access meat. So if you prefer an overweight woman, you're a bad guy. And if you this slight overweight women, you're a fat that. So there's no state of the world where someone won't accuse you of being an asshole. That's, that's the world we live in. Well isn't that just the world of just so many different people with varied opinions that are trying to justify their own physical condition? Sure. We, and that's really what it means. Have Fragile Egos. Well there's a new study that they put out recently about the, the myth of healthy obesity because I've ever seen that read many times. Or I've read that rather many times where people are trying to justify their own obesity by saying that there's this distorted perception of whether or not people are healthy because they are thin.

Speaker 4:          00:30:59       And then in fact there are some diseases. And this is kind of true. It's some sort of a weird contradiction. There's some sort of diseases where people actually do better if they recover because they're overweight. But the reason for that is not because being overweight is healthy. The reason for that is there's a lot of diseases where you don't take in any nutrients while you're sick and so your body goes into a state of ketosis where it starts burning fat and you're better off using that fat for fuel if you are overweight than if you are a very lean person was no fat to burn. Then your body starts burning off a tissue muscle tissue, which is much less healthy for you and much more dangerous. Incidentally, what you said, uh, there's I think now a movement to start fattest studies at universities. You know how you have women's studies and peace studies.

Speaker 4:          00:31:45       So fat to studies in the heart of is exactly what you led off with, which is the idea that there's this kind of medical conspiracy that's pushing a false narrative that basically says being overweight as a bad thing, when in reality there is no such evidence. You know, there's evidence of, no, sorry folks, pull up that study. It's a, it's, it's really kind of interesting because it's so black and white. There's just really no arguing about it. Fuck it. It's not good to overeat. It's just not, it's not good to tax your body, you know, having a little bit of fat. It's not that bad. Studies suggest healthy obesity might just be a meth. Um, suggested vigorous health interventions may be necessary for all obese individuals. Yeah, that's a fact. There you go. But everybody knows that. You know, that that's why you see that fat woman and people get repulsed.

Speaker 4:          00:32:32       It's not because they're mean. It's because it's not because they're taught to think that that's not an objective standard of beauty. It's just you see someone fat and you go, Oh, this is a mess. It's a mess. This is someone who's must be emotionally fragile because they're there. They're throwing food down their face. They clearly have an addiction to sugar or too simple carbs. I mean, they're, they're, they're definitely trying to make up for something. You know, there's this, this idea that people are just naturally more fat. Well, that's not true because if you look at their diet, it's almost always in support of maintaining a giant body. I mean, that's this idea that some people can, well, there are people that have hummingbird type metabolisms and they can eat ding dongs all day and still weigh 90 pounds. Yeah, that's a freak there. There's a rare, you know, my sister was like that.

Speaker 4:          00:33:21       My sister's tiny. Her nickname's peewee, that's what I call her. But when we were kids, she was always, uh, she always weighed like a hundred pounds. She could fuck it, eat anything. She could trank she could have a steak, she could eat ice cream, 90 pounds. I mean, that's just what she weighed. Or, you know, maybe I'm exaggerating, she might weigh 105, but you know what I'm saying? Like she just had that crazy metabolism. It's just the way it is now. But that's super unusual, right? For most people. And you overeat. I've posted a few photos on social media of yourself, myself at 1985. Actually, that was the first time that I've come to California to visit my brother. And your soccer players Subtler, uh, four or 5% body fat. And of course I said you really get it checked. I did get a check. Yeah. But Calipers, right?

Speaker 4:          00:34:03       Pri Calipers and the electric conductivity tests. Yeah, the electric thing sucks. I've done that electric thing before. It was an in real ways submerging, submerging the electric thing. Apparently if you're dehydrated it can be off. There's a lot of like very fat cause it's, it, a lot of it is, I might be using a bad one, but the one of them using was a one in a doctor's office, but he was even explaining to me that it can easily be off if you, uh, have, um, if you're dehydrated and there's very various factors, whatever the number was, was very low. And this was 85, so this is almost 30, well more than 30 years ago. And until up til about my early twenties, 22, 23, 24, I was always grossly underweight. The day that I stopped being a serious athlete, it just snuck up on me.

Speaker 4:          00:34:49       Every single, it's a coincidence. That's all that is. You think so? No. Okay. Of course, I didn't pick up on the sarcasm. You know, it's, it's very insane. This is society's standards that they're enforcing. I knew God, exactly. Venture of these assholes. What it is, is a bench of men who want you to feel bad. Right? Right. Yeah. So they, uh, they let you eat. There you go. Yeah, man. Just fucking run every day. You'll lose a ton of weight. Well, not, that's not enough because I actually, believe it or not, I trained a lot. The only way I lose weight as if I'm very, very careful about what I eat. Well, she thought that I never lose weight. But you're a smart guy. Why do you allow yourself to get overweight? Oh boy. We're going to get into this now. I mean, this is a subject, right? Yeah. Okay. Uh, I mean,

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       I don't think it's related to your intelligence because, well, it must be, right. Well, let me give you an issue. No, no. We'll, we'll just so quick to dismiss, but it is an issue, right? You walked into a physician's office when I had severe bronchitis. He's, he was I think a pulmonologist. He was chain smoking in his office. Now is that because he was an idiot who didn't understand the yes. Yeah. He's an idiot if he's changed, but it's an idea. It's not correlated to his Iq. Right. It's just, it's correlated to his objective assessment of what is intelligent to do with your meat vehicle. This guy is stupid. If he smoked cigarettes, that is a stupid thing to do. It doesn't mean that he can't be intelligent in other areas of his life, but he's most certainly shutting down or ignoring some really clear information that we have been given for the past, you know, 50 plus years.

Speaker 1:          00:36:26       Well, I think actually what you're, what are you talking about speaks to a point that I reason some of my writings, the idea of whether we make choices simply because we don't have the right information to make better choices. That's usually the typical argument that public policy makers use. So that basically say, Oh, if you're, if you're engaging in, uh, on, you know, uh, risky sexual behavior, or if you're engaging in a sedentary lifestyle, it's because you don't know any better. So let's set up public service announcements that teach you a better, and then hopefully people will act better and that doesn't actually work so on. So the issue is not so much that people, you know, it's not as though I don't know that being overweight is a bad thing. And now that you've taught me better, I will now change my behavior. The problem stems from the fact that there are these Darwinian pools that make it difficult for us to extricate ourselves quite.

Speaker 1:          00:37:16       Whether it be, whether you're addicted to drugs because it tickles your pleasure center in your brain, or whether it be because you addicted to sex, or whether you're addicted to a bit more food than you should be eating. Those are the Darwinian pools, uh, Poles that make it difficult for us to do the optimal decision. It's not because we're too dumb to know better or we don't have the right information. But you, William, you're, you're, you're talking about food now, not the cigarettes that this doctor was smoking, that you were using it as an example. That's not the best one because there's no Darwinian pool towards smoking satellites. Forget, forget the, the nicotine example of what I just said. In general, when we make poor decisions that lead to deleterious health outcomes, it's not because we don't know any better. So let's go back to this suntanning example.

Speaker 1:          00:38:00       Women know more about the deleterious effects of sun exposure than men do yet they do with more. If it were only a question of, you know, it's because I don't know any better than, we wouldn't expect women to be doing it more. So it's not a question of not having the right information. It's whether ultimately you have the control to not succumb to these polls. I mean, we've got the seven deadly sins since, you know, since for thousands of years precisely because very smart people understood that these are some traps that we all succumb to, whether it be greed or lust or gluttony. And my case, I've never smoked. I've never drank. But very, I mean, an elite.

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       My problem is I guess gluttony. I'm a gluttonous. Right? But when you say have the control, like what, but what steps have you ever taken to acquire the control? I mean, do you practice mindfulness? Do you meditate? Do you write down your goals? Do you write down like what you eat and what your cow, you, have you ever gone to a doctor and found out what your calorie consumption should be? Have you ever tried to alter your diet and maybe go on a fat burning diet instead of on a carbohydrate burning diet? Not the mindfulness, but all the other stuff that you've done in a fat burning diet instead of carbohydrates. Absolutely. So what have you done for them? And when I do it [inaudible] you'll see me in three months, I'll be 35 pounds lighter and you won't believe in what have you done? Like what pro?

Speaker 3:          00:39:19       So I just do a heavy protein dive, minimal carbs with a lot of vegetables, so upbeat, you know, six ounce steak, you know, with Broccoli and whatever, something like that with the tomato juice. Uh, and that I'll, I'll loose kind of like the, uh, well not the Atkins in the sense that you'd eat as much fat as you want, but it's really a lot of protein and a lot of vegetables. Well, honestly the Atkins is when you're saying eat as much fat as you want there. That is actually the trend. The trend is towards a, a ketogenic diet when he talking about getting your body to burn fat, a lot of athletes are getting involved in getting on fat burning diets. And I actually switched my own diet to that where, I mean, it didn't really have a problem being overweight, but I was definitely heavier and I had more body fat than I have now.

Speaker 3:          00:40:05       And what I did was I switched over to this. Uh, this is a guy named Mark Sisson who was on my podcast before. Um, and he wrote this book called the primal blueprint. And, uh, it's the idea behind it is that you're, when you're eating a lot of simple carbs and a lot of pastas and breads, you're getting insulin spikes, your body's processing all that sugar and your body stores it and your body starts burning sugar. Whereas if you can get your body to a ketogenic state, meaning your body burns fats and uses that for fuel rather than carbohydrates, you don't really want high protein. You want, um, uh, minimal protein. You want what you're supposed to have, which is like, you know, six ounce steak is fine, but what you really want is a bunch of healthy fats like coconut oil, Avocados. I eat a lot of Avocados.

Speaker 3:          00:40:49       Salmon is excellent, excellent. But also because excellent because it supplies you with Omega six isn't threes the essential fatty acids, which are really important for brain function. But people this, this idea, this is also a big fucking problem that people have. We've been lied to about fats, about the danger of saturated fats and the danger of cholesterol. Dietary cholesterol barely moves the needle on blood lipids. It's not dietary cholesterol. It's a problem. It's sedentary lifestyle. It's overeating. It's a consumption of excess carbs is a bunch of factors that cause people to be fat and it's not necessarily saturated fats or or um, or cholesterol. In fact, saturated fats and cholesterol, that's the substrate for building testosterone. Like when, when I went on this diet of, uh, having my body burn fat and not just me, but a ton of my friends, my friend Denny, um, uh, who was a, a an elite athlete is a Brazilian Jujitsu world champion.

Speaker 3:          00:41:47       Um, my friend John Rollo who's a MMA fighter, Brazilian Jujitsu, black belt, these guys have all reported jai and me included gigantic spikes in their testosterone production. And it's because that is the building blocks for testosterone. So when you're eating these low fat diets and these, uh, these like minimalistic diets to try to get your body to be more healthy, you're dropping your body sex hormone production. Well, we'll have to ask my wife if she has any complaints of that department. But, uh, Oh God, fuck. Honestly, uh, the only problem I have is when I walk, when I walk away from those types of dyes, that is where the problem arises. Of course. Yeah. But I bet that if you walked away from what had, whenever you're on that diet, when you get off it, the things this integrate very quickly. If you don't descend it, well, I'm, but I guess for me they do.

Speaker 3:          00:42:42       I mean, I could, I could put on seven pounds in two weeks by simply eating. Normally once I'm away from that side is normal. Then if you're putting that much weight, seven pounds in two weeks is 14 pounds in a month. I mean, that means 28 pounds in two months. Some liberty, that's not normal. Okay. That's a crazy amount of weight to put on. If I saw you two months later and you put it on 28 pounds, I'm like, what the fuck are you doing? No, I'd have to grab you by the hand and sit down with you and go, come on, man. I don't want you to die. I, I'm already thinking about all the comments that are going to be at the blind. Oh boy. Well I'm, I mean I'm just saying this cause I'm your friend. I want to get your copy of this book.

Speaker 3:          00:43:16       Okay. That I would love you to try to do it, but it's not hard to just eat til you're satisfied and not eat until you're full. That's a big factor. That alone is probably 20% of everyone's meal. A lot of people eat and then they keep going. I love to do that. That's fucking awesome. I love to eat a giant bowl of pasta and eat a big steak, but I also work out like a terrorist. I do that. I work out almost every day. I kind of work out hard, so I keep my body fat down because of that. So even if my diet has shit, I still keep my body fat down because of tremendous working out. But then when I adjust my diet as well, I saw a big difference in my energy levels and my cognitive function and a, and a big difference in just overall wellness. Right. You know, I just don't, I mean I'm an extremist when it comes to physical performance because obviously I've been around it my whole life and I'm in the martial arts world and I'm, I'm trying to get my body to do certain things that are very unusual. But I just think that people are not designed to eat big plates of Pasta or bread or all these sugars that everybody downs in the form of corn syrup drinks. It's just not good for you. Have you seen the uh, documentary sugar

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       or something? I can't remember what the sugar, that sugar movie. Yeah, it was crazy. Festival is a watch with my kids and then we went to the supermarket was hilarious cause they're, they're grabbing things, going sugar in this, they were like grabbing things off the shelf, finding how many grams of sugar per serving or, and everything. So let us, maybe I'll say this, you know, if you say something publicly, then you have to kind of add to it. Say it. So let, here's, here's what should I look at the camera here? Uh, next time I'm on your show, I should hopefully be visibly thinner. Yeah. Which you're going to do is you're going to wait until two weeks before the show and then you're going to stop your period and you're going to do, I'm going to go anorexia, Anorexia and stop your reproductive system.

Speaker 4:          00:45:11       Very nice. Yeah. I mean it's just people should be more healthy and the body is designed, I mean this is this whole trend for like Paleo Diet, Paleo diets and Paleolithic Diet. That's not an accurate term. It's a, it's an, it's an, it's a good way to eat, but it's not an accurate evolutionary term because in the Para Paleolithic era, people ate a lot of grains. They whatever the fuck they could, they bugs. They were hungry, you know, and they worked hard to acquire it off. Yes, exactly. That's a big point. When they needed those calories in grains, like, look, if you're out hiking every day, you talk to people that are like mountain climbers and hikers, like they're eating massive amounts of calories. I have friends that go on these gigantic mountain trips and they literally cannot consume enough because they pack all their food. Um, and my friend Jason just got back from this a big trip that he was taking to the Yukon and he's going up and doing all this mountain climbing.

Speaker 4:          00:46:05       They climbed a, they went a hundred miles in eight days up in the mountains, like at 10,000 feet altitude. So it's, it's this incredibly grueling experience because there's very little air and you're constantly doing squats cause you're constantly lifting your body up. You're going up hill and they were eating two pounds of food a day. That's all you could take. So you have to eat the most calorie dense two pounds of food that you could carry because you know, for this trip, you know, you're only carrying a certain amount of food cause you have to have your sleeping bag on your back, your tent, all that jazz. And he'd come out of there, you're 15 pounds lighter right here. And you know, you just had this incredible, I mean it's like, it's, it's like running a marathon every day almost. Are you familiar with the field of evolutionary medicine?

Speaker 4:          00:46:49       Does that ring a bell? What way? So evolutionary medicine is basically, actually I had one of the pioneers of the field on my show. His name is Randy Nessa. He's a physician by training. So evolutionary medicine is basically trying to infuse within medicine evolutionary ideas. Uh, typically most physicians are trained in the proximate world, right? We were talking about proximate and ultimate about how to deal with the how and what other disease without ever asking the ultimate wide Darwinian why. So as relating to something that we talking about now, if you look at the top killers around the world, you know, colon cancer and diabetes and heart disease and high blood pressure, they're all related. As evolutionary folks argue to that, what's called the mismatch hypothesis. The idea being that those things that were adaptive to us in an environment of scarcity become grossly maladaptive and an environment of plenty like we have today.

Speaker 4:          00:47:45       That makes sense. And so basically what you're having, I mean, my gustatory preferences don't change. So my desire to eat the fatty foods remains. But what has changed is the fact that I used, I had to do 20,000 calories of expenditure to punt it down then and now I could go to the grocery store and get it. There is no caloric uncertainty in local a scarcity. And so if you look at hunter gatherer societies that most closely mimic, you know, our evolutionary past, they don't have all those diseases. So once they clear the early childhood mortality threats than they actually live quite long lifespans precisely because they don't suffer from, I think they're the nine top killers. So that's a way of taking some of this stuff that you're very interested in and infusing it with a bit more of an evolutionary twist. So that totally makes sense that people would have to expand massive amount of cowers to track down food.

Speaker 4:          00:48:35       Because that was at one point in time what we did all day with our day, whether it's hunting or gathering or or farming. We were constantly working to try to acquire food. That was it. Now that food is so easy, we still have the same genes. Right? Exactly. Right. Yeah. So look natural selection, right? That the mechanism of how species evolve, traits that they have. I mean it all, when I teaching my students, I start off by colloquially saying, look, most animals, including humans throughout their history had faced, you know, either you don't want to become somebody else's dinner and you want to get enough for dinner for yourself. Those are the sort of the two big that the problems. And then you just add to that sexual selection, which is it's not enough to simply survive. Then you have to mate. And so then you had want to get the right mannequin that I tear you go.

Speaker 4:          00:49:23       So that's basically natural and sexual selection and in one sentence, right, don't become somebody dinner, get enough dinner and then get a mate. And there's your evolutionary is how much, if at all, do you pay attention to your gut health? Do you, do you eat probiotics? Ooh, see that's crazy. Is that right? Oh my God. Probiotics are one of the most important aspects of healthy bodies like your gut health can infect or can affect rather your mood. It can affect cognitive function, can affect your personality. There's all these studies being done now on probiotics and of gut health and bacteria content and Gut Candida. If you have a high level of candy to which a lot of people do eat a lot of sugar and simple carbs, it be, it developed. You developed this intense craving and hunger for sugar and simple carbs. When you adjust your gut bacteria, when you start taking in healthy probiotics in the form of Keifer. Um, I like Kombucha. I like Kimchi. I like fermented cabbage and sauerkrauts and natural sauerkrauts and things along those lines. Um, I, I drank a of different kinds

Speaker 3:          00:50:27       of them and take a bunch of different kinds of them every day along with this thing called the, on it total gut health, which is a packet that I take with every meal. It's a massive factor because what's in your gut, like your gut flora is incredibly important for your overall health and for supporting your immune system. So has that become sort of part of the daily, not daily, the yearly, a health checkup that people do? It depends on what doctor you're talking to. You see, because most doctors spend very little time studying nutrition, right? When you go to medical school and you get a degree, you, I mean the amount of hours that you spend studying nutrition are so small end by the time you're out there practicing. This is a field that's constantly evolving and changing and growing and this, this 10 toward this, I'm leaning towards probiotics as a a health supplement.

Speaker 3:          00:51:18       It's fairly recent in terms of like mainstream exposure, but incredibly important. It makes a big fee. First of all, I hardly ever get sick and it's a big factor cause I, I travel constantly. You're shaking hands, shaking, hands, icons. I'm constantly flying on planes and I hardly ever get sick and if I do I can point to some pretty obvious factors. Like I didn't get any sleep. My kids are going to school again. They were around other people that are sick. They're sitting in my lap, Kop it in my face. It's normal stuff. And even then I bounced back very quickly and I attribute that to probiotics. I think it's really important to take in healthy cultures. Have you, are you feeling, here's another example from evolutionary medicine that relates to children's since you mentioned children. Uh, you probably have heard of the studies that show that if you grow up in an environment that doesn't have any natural, uh, allergens, you at an increased risk of developing respiratory illnesses like asthma.

Speaker 3:          00:52:11       That makes sense sic because it doesn't trigger your immune system to have the types of responses that you typically would have encountered. So if you have a mother or a father or both parents who are incredibly lcd about having a perfectly sterile and spotless home, prepare for the onset of asthma, that's another example of it's asthma, but not necessarily allergies. My, my, one of my daughters is allergic to cats. We've had cats her whole life. We've also had dogs her whole life. She's been around in these animals her whole life, but she's allergic to them. What, what are the manifestations of, she starts sneezing or eyes get puffy. The cat can't sleep in the bed with her. If the cat does, she'll, she starts sneezing and she can't help. But it's soon. It's because my wife's allergic. It's just genetics. Okay. Yeah. She's also solar g to horses that we were in Italy and we were riding on one of those horse carriages and she wasn't even on the horse or touching the horse just but being behind the horse on a horse carriage, she starts sneezing and coughing and we had to get off the, uh, off the carriage.

Speaker 3:          00:53:08       You know, it fits the saliva, the horse or the standard. The dander. Yeah. I'm sure she's allergic to saliva too, but I'm just not swapping spit with a horse and grow. Settle down. Gotcha. All right. What's next on the docket? Now that you've convinced me that I eat to lose weight as well. I'm not saying that you need to lose weight, but I'm saying you're a healthy, you're a smart guy. You think about it very good life. You're very handsome, you bronze, you're shiny. You're thinking in these terms of like looking at the big picture, but yet there you've got this blind spot and his blind spot is because you have this indulgence for food and you look forward to it. It becomes your reward at the end of the day and you sit down, did you indulge? And then you, you say, Hey, I've worked hard for this and I can enjoy it and now I'm married, I've got kids I don't need to look beautiful.

Speaker 3:          00:53:52       And you want to hear something that says we're getting personal in California, when we lived in California, I actually naturally lost a lot of weight without having to worry about anything. I was a lot more active. I ate less. And what about you? We've talked about a reward when you're in the dark cold winters of Montreal and the only reward delivery system is for us to be foodies, then that's the problem. Right. And we often talk about that. My wife and I because we eat at Joe beef and Montreal, uh, that he's your friend, right? Yeah. If you eat in there, I have not. Good Lord. You are in the same town as the greatest restaurant on the planet earth. We're supposed to go there together. I think when can go back, something happened. Yeah, we will. Next time. Next time I'm there. I'll take you.

Speaker 3:          00:54:37       Hopefully I'll be in California. Going to have to, yeah, hopefully. But if you are there, you're going to have to indulge. Yeah. That's one of those places we've got to get off the ducks. Yeah. Well it's, it's okay to have a cheat day. Yeah, you're right. But you know, um, I think a lot of people have those blind spots and even intelligent. Pete, what's yours? Ooh, booze. Yesterday we got fucked up. Me and Hannibal burress to the podcast. We've got a little too hammered. That's one of those things where I enjoy it while it's happening, but like I worked out today and my head was kind of throbbing. I was like, this is so stupid. And then I don't do it every day, but I do it maybe once a week or once every two weeks or something like that. It's just, I know objectively that it's not healthy so that you enjoy the taste or the effects after your drinks.

Speaker 3:          00:55:22       Enjoy having drinks with friends and getting stupid laughing, you know? Um, that, I just know it's not healthy. It's just, there's nothing healthy about booze. Right. There's nothing wrong. And actually there is some, some studies that suggest that, uh, it's a actually pretty healthy to have a glass of wine or two with a meal and you know, you're getting Rivera trawl. And also there's some studies that uh, or, or some, uh, some indications at 0.2 people developed for a long time drinking wine because they couldn't drink still water because they would get traveler's disease where if they found water would have pathogens in it and they would wind up getting sick. So they drank wine for that purpose because he can carry it around with you and it's not going to go bad. But um, but getting drunk like we were drinking whiskey, drink jamison or something like that, I'm out on the rocks. It felt great, were hammered and laughing. But God damn it, it's so bad for your body. So if there's, if there's an indulgence that I take part in that's not good. It's the occasional getting fucked up. Gotcha.

Speaker 4:          00:56:23       Yeah, it's not good, but I don't have a lot of those. I mean, I'm pretty good at not having a lot of those, those things in my life, but it's easy to do that. It's easy to trip yourself up because there's a natural tendency towards distraction. You know, the pressure of a attempting to be successful at something. The pressure of whether it's competition or whether it's uh, just this yearning for achievement. We look for a release, you know, from that pressure. And that's what a lot of people do. They go to cigarettes, so they go to booze or they go to food or whatever it is. Yeah. I've never smoked a single cigarette in my entire life. Good one puff good. I did when I was like 15. I smoked a cigarette with my sister. She kept going. I quit. I was like, fuck, this is so stupid.

Speaker 4:          00:57:05       Is that, I think that if you hit 19 and you haven't started, you almost have zero chance of starting. Oh, I know. People have started in their thirties due to start study was fucking 40 years old. He started smoking cigarettes, smoking. What are you doing man? So weird. But again, I think it's a sabotage thing where people just go, fuck it. We don't care. And by doing that, it's almost like they can, um, by saying, fuck it, I don't care about my health. They could say, fuck it. I don't care about my student loans. Fuck it. I don't care about my wife leaving me. Fuck it. I don't care about my mortgage. Fuck it. I don't care about losing my job. It's like this, this sort of like denial of reality by indulging in something that's not healthy. It reminded me of a irrational position that one of my former students took to justify him smoking.

Speaker 4:          00:57:53       And so if you, I don't know if you'd do this in the United States, but in Canada, Health Canada, uh, has this program where they put very vivid images on cigarette packets. You have the same thing here, right? They used to, well, not that they don't have images, but they have the sayings. Okay. But in Canada with these images, I should even say they used to, they still do. There's still like, so you know what he would do, what to show you how irrational human beings are. So he would, let's say ask for whatever the brand was marble roll. Now he would receive one and look at it. If the warning message was one that would be relevant to him, he'd ask for another one until he received got low birth weight. He got low or you don't, don't drink while pregnant. It doesn't apply to me.

Speaker 4:          00:58:39       And since I looked at, I said he was serious. But you obviously know Bill Hicks bit, by the way. What does that, what does Bill Hicks, who's one of the greatest comics hour? There was a bit that he had on exactly that point. Said just, just pick one that doesn't apply. Low birth weight. Good. Oh, there you go. Maybe he got it from him. But it shows you how, even though we often have our fully cognizant objectively about some truth, uh, our ability to engage in self deception is limitless. Right? Well, it is for some folks. And I think, uh, again, that goes back to mindfulness. It goes back to meditation. It goes back to reflection. Most people live their lives in a constant state of momentum. The momentum of the past constantly propelling themselves forward, and they're always adjusting and trying to make up for all the mistakes that their past is made.

Speaker 4:          00:59:26       They don't live their life in a state of, in the now they lived their life in a state of, fuck. Why did I do that? Now I gotta do this. You know what I, you know what I used to come to and I think, let me let me know if you feel it too, because you have young children. I'm obsessed about first, for example, this is the first time that my daughter did this and they'll never be another first. I'm always panicking about them growing up. Really? Yeah. I want to sort of weird, just it, there's a purity, you know, look, we live in a world where we're exposed because we're in the public eye. We're exposed to a lot of negativity. Even though we're exposed to a 100 fold more positivity, you know, it's a, it's a rough ride out there. And then my solace is coming home to the purity and innocence of my children.

Speaker 4:          01:00:12       And then the reality is that you can't bottle up that innocence and that purity forever. And so I, so speaking of the here and now, rather than oftentimes just enjoying the moment, I'm always worried that, you know, in five years she, she's going to be a prepubescent girl and then there's going to be a bunch of, take this young boys that are gonna come around. So that's something that truly bothers me. Does it doesn't affect you? I mean, I, I don't dwell on it honestly. I mean, I just try to enjoy every moment I can with them and try and enjoy all the different stage of their life. Right. But, uh, you know, I, I remember what they were like when they were babies, when they could barely talk. And I, it was, I was thinking I could never love something. It's a lot, much as I love them, but now I think when I talked to them, I love them even more because now I get to have little conversations with people.

Speaker 4:          01:01:01       You know, when you have like a deep conversation with an eight year old, it's pretty intense and it's one of your child and your daughter. It's pretty intense, isn't it? Humbling when they ask you things that clearly demonstrates out, you know, little about so many things because they often will ask you the questions that are profound and deep. Why is lightning in that particular form? And you try to concoct some story while being truthful and then oftentimes they stump you. Right? Uh, all right. Just go to Google man. Well it's got a heart to go to Google while you're driving and having a conversation about some, some observation of that just made, but it just shows you again the, the, the purity of the child and sort of looking at the world and hitting you with questions that you frankly can't answer. Well I always like to say that I can't answer it.

Speaker 4:          01:01:46       I think it's important to let kids know that you don't know everything. Right. You know, cause I think children automatically look towards adults as being some sort of superior form of a child. You know, like the, well, I don't know anything, but I'm a little kid, but my dad will know. And then you know, if you let them know like, Hey, there's just way too much information for everyone to know. But what's important is you're honest about what you do now. Yes. And we were very fortunate that we have this thing called the Internet so we can find out what it is that we're trying to give them the answer for. And incidentally, I do that with my one. They ask a question and let's see. I don't know the answer. I'm very open. I said, you know what? I think you've gone with this one.

Speaker 4:          01:02:25       Yeah, good for you. Why don't you send me an email, remind me. And I'll look into it. And, and I do it just naturally, but oftentimes they'll write back to me and say, you know why that was so refreshing? But you know, you are humble enough to not pretend that you know everything about every single thing. You know, I, yeah, I love that. And it's so frustrating when you're talking to someone who was really smart, who don't, doesn't want to admit that they don't know something or wants to deny something's true when they haven't researched it. It's very frustrating. I have a friend who's a brilliant guy who does that. He just, you'll bring something up and he's like, that's not true. And you're like, oh Jesus fucking Christ. We just google it. Right? And I've done it with him over and over and over again.

Speaker 4:          01:03:00       I had to have a conversation with them. I said, listen man, if I tell you something, it's true. It's, I'm not making it up. And if I'm wrong, it's a, it's an honest mistake. But if you just google it, then you'll know. But you're, you're saying it's not true and you've never even looked at it. But here we are in 2016 give a fucking, you have a device in your pocket. We can get the answer to virtually anything at anytime. Oh, shit is out the window. So what's the psychological trait? Ego. Ego. He's a very smart guy and he wants to be the smartest guy in the room all the time. And so it just gets really frustrating, especially if we're somewhere with, there's no Internet service. You're like, we're going to get to Internet service motherfucker, and then you're gonna apologize. It's, it's, it's this thing that people do where they, uh, when you're having a conversation with someone, they're not just talking to you.

Speaker 4:          01:03:45       They're engaged in a contest. Yes. Oh yeah. Men Do that. All that. I have several of those in my own, uh, and not nuclear family, but my family of procreation, so might brutal and say who but brutal. Right? And, and here's another thing that you'd never admit that you're wrong, right, because admitting that you're wrong makes you lose face. And that's such a detrimental dynamic to have. Right? I mean, you know, I might come home at night and, um, I've had a tough day and I might respond curtly to my dog. I actually, we'll go back and then hug my dog because I have enough self awareness to realize that I didn't give her enough attention. Right. So I have enough humility to nevermind, you know, another human. My dog is just as important to me and if I responded curtly I will sort of apologize to her yet I haven't got family members.

Speaker 4:          01:04:34       Uh, again, this is not my family of my wife or kids, but the family that I was born into that have never apologized about anything because they come from a cultural landscape where to apologize to your child, to somebody younger is to lose face at parent is always right. And I mean that might work when you're too, but when you're both now adults, I think you sort of have to get out of that and realize that we all make mistakes and we all have to own up to them. We all have to apologize, honesty when we make a mistake. And yet some people it's super unhealthy and it's unhealthy for the person who doesn't admit they make the mistake too because then it puts you in this position of being in denial of what you know to be the truth, right? You're going to run around pretending that you were right all when you know in

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       your head that you were wrong. So it diminishes your own personal opinions about yourself, right? You're not sorry. Ready on this exact point. Okay. So I'm having a chat with a family member, an older family member of mine for my family as the problem person. This is, this is one of the key problem for people in with my family. And we, uh, he says something to the effect of, Oh, you know, those ancient Greeks, uh, those Christians were really, uh, antisemetic where I come up with these details. I said, oh, well, you know, I'm, I'm sorry, I don't mean to correct you, but, uh, those ancient Greeks were not Christian. As a matter of fact, the way we mark that eras, we say bce before common era or BC before Christ. So by definition, those guys were marked as not being Christian. So when he's now faced with sort of historical evidence that suggested he was wrong, what do you think he does?

Speaker 1:          01:06:10       It's, it's so grotesque that I'm not even sure you can guess what he did. I don't want to guess. So he basically says no, that's right. That's what I said. I said that they weren't Christian and you said that they were Christian, so he looks at you in the face. That's, that's called, if I, if you don't mind me saying on air, that's mind fucking right. He looks at you in the face. He knows that, you know, but he has enough in Arabic. You say what? Ha it's the, it's this kind of pathological pride. Right. Fuck you. Right. I'm going to look at you. Right. So rather than saying, Oh gee, I didn't know that. Thanks for correcting me. He flips what our original points of disagreement was there. You can talk to that dude. You've got to cut that guy loose. Well, maybe I have, oh, maybe have molly can I said that.

Speaker 1:          01:06:56       Yeah, that's a, that's an unfortunate characteristic in men. Uh, I guess it probably exists in women too, but I see it more in men, uh, that they will, they'll always want to be right, right. You know, but it doesn't make you better to have information that someone doesn't have. Like I like when someone can tell me something that I don't know. Sure. It's interesting. I suspect that one of the reasons why your podcast is so successful is because you exhibit that generosity. If you came to the, to every discussion thinking that there is nothing that the other person could bring to the table, you're not going to have a show that's going to last long though. Well that's also, it's impossible says we're not talking about like the 1950s when people at this narrow view of the world, it was defined by their own environment, right?

Speaker 1:          01:07:38       We're talking about this broad place now where you can just access all sorts of data. And one of the beautiful things about the podcast is by sitting down with people like you or all the other awesome guests I get to sit down with, I get to experience the wisdom and the information of someone who's lived a completely different life than me. And I just find that really fascinating. And I just think that that arrogance that someone would display by doing what that guy did to you and switching around your, your points. And just that's just a child that's like a developmental dead end that this person went down still. So unhealthy. I hear you. But so common, right? So common. Yeah. What's next? What do want to talk about? I want to talk about your paper that you brought up. Oh yeah, sure. So this is a paper that uh, I was invited to write and one of the leading journals in the field general marketing research, uh, where I was asked to talk about the methods of evolutionary psychology, how evolutionary psychologists conduct research.

Speaker 1:          01:08:41       And it was specifically to address some of the common canards that we hear from the tractors of evolution psychology. Oh, it's all a bunch of post hoc storytelling and so on. And so the paper basically looks at three points, two of which we've already sort of covered. One is the distinction between proximate and ultimate explanations. And again, that's a very important point to make because it basically argues that you'll never have a full explanation of any phenomenon involving biological agents if you don't study the phenomenon at both the proximate and ultimate level, approximately how, what ultimate is the Darwinian wise. That's one we've already covered that one. The second method of evolution psychology is the building of these networks of cumulative evidence. Like the one I gave you with the waist to hip ratio. Uh, maybe I'll give you another one as an example of this mechanism.

Speaker 1:          01:09:31       So for example, if I want to argue that toy preferences have sex specificity, that is innate, right? So it's not that cause typically in the social sciences we, we hear that what makes little boys, little boys and little girls, little girls, little girls, is that boys are taught to play rough with the GI. Joe Girls are taught to play gentle with the pink thought. But that's dismissed. I mean, you, you, you hear that, but it's a very fringe in the social sciences. It isn't, it, it's, it's still up there. Well, it's only because of liberal colleges. It's not because of a, it's, it's not people that are objectively intelligent that are recognizing us, but certainly in terms of the university landscape that is the dominant, uh, navigate. What are they uses evidence to point that men are taught to that because they've proven that children absolutely gravitate just based on gender gravitate towards certain types of tasks and toys.

Speaker 1:          01:10:25       So that's what I'm going to do next is I'm going to demonstrate how evolutionary psychologists build these numb logical networks of keen wealth of evidence. So if I want it to prove that that premise that you argued is dismissed is truly laughable, how would I go about them? And so that's one of the things that I did in the paper. So we could look at children who are in the pre socialization stage of their cognitive development, meaning that by definition they're too young to have been socialized and we could do studies on them to see what is it that the, that that they, you know, approach first or what is it that they gaze at longer. And we see that there is a sex specificity in such young children. So already it demonstrates that it's probably not due to socialization. So that's evidence line number one. We could take other species vervet monkeys and rhesus monkeys. And now there's some research

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       with chimps showing that they exhibit the same sex specificity. Would these types of toys as human infants do? They done number two, we could take data from a clinical population. So there's a this order known as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which is an endocrinological problem that masculinized as little girls that masculinized his little girls, both in their morphology but also in their behaviors. So if you take little girls who suffer from this disorder, what do you think happens in their toy preferences? They become more like those of little boys. We could take a depictions on funerary monuments, uh, you know, these big mausoleums of that people, uh, from ancient Greece. And you look at depictions of little boys and little girls and you'll see that the little boys are depicted with the typical toys, you know, with a ball, with a, something with a wheel thing.

Speaker 5:          01:12:04       Little girls are depicted with dolls. You could do the studies across a wide range of cultures that are very different from western cultures. The phenomenon manifests itself again. And so what you do, again in evolutionary theory is you build this normal, normal logical network of cumulative evidence coming from completely different data sets that then makes it unassailable to argue against it. So that's the second method of evolution psychology. The third one I argue is a evolutionary psychology operates on what are, what are called consilience trees of knowledge. Consilience is a term that had sort of lost its way. It basically refers to unity of knowledge. So if you say for example, physics is more conciliatory than sociology, it's because physics has these organize knowledge trees that sociology doesn't, okay, so what is a typical tree of knowledge and evolutionary theory? So you could start with something like sexual selection.

Speaker 5:          01:12:58       Sexual selection is basically the idea that how do, how does a peacock evolve? It's a big tail. So, so how do animals evolve their traits to give them reproductive advantage? That's been established from the time of Darwin through a million different species. So now that leads to down the tree to another theory. It's called the mid level theory called parental investment theory. Parental investment theory basically says that if you want to know about sex differences within a species, look at the minimal, I would look at Dory parental investment that each sex has to have in that species. So in most species it's the female that has more parental investment. So typically they're smaller. It's the males who fight for access to females. Females are more careful about the May choices they make. But you also have sex role reversal species where it's as the males who have greater parental investment.

Speaker 5:          01:13:47       What do you think happens to the sex differences there? Exactly reversed, right? So that has been also established. So now we go down. Parental investment theory leads to another theory that basically says that in the human context females will make more judicious may choices than men. In other words, women are more careful and the types of make choices that they must make precisely because they have greater costs if they make a wrong may think choice, which leads to a study that I did. Looking at how much information the men and women look at before they either reject mates or choose mates. And what do you think the results shows when it comes to rejecting mates? Women need less convincing. In other words, they, they acquire less information before they decide all these mates are losers. On the other hand, when it comes to choosing a mate, women look at more information prior to choosing.

Speaker 5:          01:14:39       So what I've shown you here is how you start with a general principle and work down a tree to a specific hypothesis. That's called a tree of knowledge of evolutionary theory. That's what the method of evolutionary psychology is. So contrary to what typical the tractors, there'll be some buffoon, some customer data on your, uh, at the bottom of your comments section that says, but evolutionary sciences, that's not a real solid mckinnis toronto. Right? Okay. So that's hilarious. Yeah, you liked that, huh? That's the turn out of that is good. Uh, singers and other balls chopped off. I usually call him the Castrati brigade and of course in the singular form, that's gus throttle, right? So it's a guy who walks around without testes, but a very inflated ego who then tells you, you know, despite the fact that you've spent 20 plus years studying something, he knows more than you. All of you evolutionary scientists are full in order.

Speaker 3:          01:15:30       Well, it's, it's interesting to me that there would be people that would be involved in universities that would debate this sort of very objective research. Right? Right. I mean, especially when it comes to gender and obviously there's variables, but when it comes to the, the gravitating towards certain types of toys and tasks and, and then it also pertains to career choices as well. Like there's this big push to get women involved in stem and women involved in technology and other th there's discrimination. Women in tech, well, no, w women don't gravitate towards those particular jobs. They don't want to do them. Some do. And the ones that do, they cry sexism because there's so few of them. Well, there's just no, it's just not something that they naturally gravitate towards. Overwhelming.

Speaker 5:          01:16:17       Well, that's what, I don't know if you remember the, the whole debacle with Larry Summers, who was the president of Harvard University who then became, I don't know if he was in the Obama administration, but here's this guy who was president of Harvard University. He was giving a speech, probably Jamie can pull it up if he has time. Uh, and he was basically giving a talk where he hinted to exactly what you said. He said that he didn't say, Oh, you know, women don't have the capacity to get into these fields. Right. I think he hinted to exactly what your sensitive then they might not like it as much. Despite these very aggressive programs that we've instituted to try to attract women, maybe they're not drunk, just hinting at that led him to eventually stepping down as president of Harvard.

Speaker 3:          01:17:01       It's a real problem in colleges and universities today with that, with this denial of reality to her to help other people's feelings, where to make other, but to placate other people's feelings. And it's also this repeating that even Obama has been involved in repeating this myth that women working the same job make 77 cents for every dollar that a man makes. That's not true. I don't know if you've ever researched that or gone into that. So I know, I know from two sources, the only two sources that I've sort of paid attention to that have addressed this. I think as Milo Yiannopoulos, who's sort of been one of the big champions to try to dismantle that narrative. Well it's just, it's been dismantled by sociologists, has been dismantled. Dena hoff summers. Yeah. Did it so, so, yeah. Yeah, I think you're exactly right. Well, the, the data is wrong.

Speaker 3:          01:17:43       I mean it's, it's totally misinterpreted. The real data is when you look at the overall wealth, like what men make versus what women make. Men make more money, but they also work more hours. They also choose different jobs. They also are at a higher risk to die on the job. There's all of these different factors. The misconception is that a man and a woman working side by side doing the same job that the woman is making 77 cents to the man's dollar. That is not true. Exactly right. And that's the problem with this thing. And even fucking Obama, he, he parroted that and Sarah Silverman did it recently, one of those, Hillary Clinton's speech is talking about how women make less than men. It's not true. Right? But it's one of those things that if you tell people they don't believe you, like you have to, you have to send them studies and then they read it and you're like, we have this myth has been perpetrated so pervasively.

Speaker 3:          01:18:33       It's so common that people parrot it and no one questions it. The fucking president parrots it on television like intellectually that is so incredibly dishonest for him to do that. If he is aware of the actual stats and he says that just because he knows that's what people want to hear. Like, oh, Obama does care. He is, he's caring and sympathetic and he's not a pig. I mean, similar narrative has been proposed and you could probably could fill in the details regarding the, I don't know what the number is. You know, one in five women on university campuses will experience a sexual assault. That is a ridiculous stat that is, I don't know that that's not the ice did define sexual assault. If it's a guy making an an an unwanted grope, you know that a guy moves in for a kiss when he doesn't, I mean, I think you're dealing with a lot of awkward kids.

Speaker 3:          01:19:28       They're drunk and they do stupid shit and some of it easily could be sexual assault or sexual, you know, in propriety. I, I don't, I don't necessarily think that that number's off so that I think rape is much more, much more complicated. I mean that then I think you're talking about something way, way more. I'm way less common, but way more disturbing. And uh, I think the, the real re the real statistics about how many women get raped or I'm way different than what is being proposed. The problem is you start talking about things like an unwanted grope or someone slapping someone in the ass that that all gets factored in.

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       Then they start factoring in things like having sex while intoxicated and that becomes sexual assault. But conveniently only for the man to be the one who's the sexual assault or like if a woman is sober in the man is drunk, no one has ever accusing the woman of being a rapist by having sex with a drunk man. Right. Have we talked, uh, speaking of very private, I'm not sure if we've discussed it on the show, that'd be discussed, the rape by fraud story of this show. Yes, we have. Well there's also the new laws that are being passed rate by fraud, which is a fascinating, like if a guy says he's a prince and you know, I'm going to take you to my council, you will live in luxury forever. Right. But he's really not a prince. That guy can get charged with rape. What are your thoughts on that?

Speaker 4:          01:20:53       Well, the guy's a piece of shit. So Amal be arrested as a rapist? Well, no, but he is definitely a liar. It's, it's, it's really tricky. It's like what is he doing exactly? Uh, he's being a liar. He's telling a story that's not true. And because of that, of girls having sex with him, he's immortal. He's unethical. It's reprehensible behavior. He's not criminal. Criminal. Because if that were criminal, as I think I might've mentioned on your show before, 95% of people who are engaged in online dating are rapists. Well, yeah, that's, that's true. And also a lot of guys will lie to themselves, the raping themselves, you know, pretending they really loved that one. When I tell it now, musterbation is raping yourself even mean masturbation. I mean, having sex with someone, you don't really, you're not really attracted. You just horny as fuck and you convince yourself this is the right girl.

Speaker 4:          01:21:40       And then as soon as your orgasm, you're like, I gotta get the Fuck Outta here. I just wrote myself. Um, I think, um, there's something immoral about it. There's something unethical about it, but it, it becomes very tricky when you try to decide whether or not that's a crime. Right? Or you want to prosecute someone for rape, for doing something like that. Also, it's weird because presumably the woman had sex with that man, uh, voluntarily and enjoyed it and then decided she didn't enjoy it when she realized that guy was crazy or a liar. Isn't that just like a lesson? Like isn't that just a life lesson and now you're going to go and be way more picky with who you decide to have sex with? Well, I mean, think of it this way. I mean, again, let's link it back to evolutionary theory, not just in the human context, but across the animal kingdom.

Speaker 4:          01:22:26       There's endless manifestations of the set of signaling, right? Sure. Animals including engage in deceptive signaling, right? I mean, he's an example that doesn't relate to me thing. Uh, apple somatic colorings, which is basically warning colors, right? So you have a species of say, Amazonian frog that has very vivid colors. Why? Why would it be vivid? Well, because it is advertising to everybody. Hey, don't approach me. I'm very venomous. Right? Well then there'll be another species of frog that piggybacks on that coloring. That actually itself is not at all venomous but yet because it is a Serp, this signal now nobody will attack it, right? Oh boy. What a, what

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       a fraud. What it right. So, so the idea, and again I don't want to receive comments now that I support lying and so it is reprehensible. It is unethical, it is immoral. I don't do the behavior of course, but it's part of life. People lie to one another. People lie to themselves. I think I might've mentioned on this show before and even if I have, it's, it's worth repeating. Uh, there's a gentleman, a very famous biologist by the name of Robert trevors. We've talked about the evolutionary roots of self deception, right? Why is it that we deceive ourselves? And then the argument there is that the reason why I have to first believe in the lie before selling it to you is because when I lie, I actually have these micro expressions that serve as tale tale signs of my line. If I could suppress these so that when you're trying to look at my face to see if there are any signatures of deception on my face, you won't read them because I've already lied to myself.

Speaker 1:          01:23:59       And so they are even clear evolutionary adaptive reasons for why we lie to ourselves, nevermind lying to others. So lying and deception is part of the large repertoire of human behaviors. And to call somebody a rapist for engaging in that represents that we'd behavior it does nobody any good. Hmm. That's interesting. Now deception also has to be defined like lying and rape by deception. Like at what level are we still calling it rape by deception? Like if a guy has a fake rolex on, right? Like, and he's advertising that he's wealthy when in fact he's not, I mean, when a guy pretends he's making $100,000 a year, but it really makes 45 let's make it less fun. Let's make it more fuzzy. Okay. How about if I am actually a very, uh, apathetic guy who can't get out of bed till 11 o'clock in the morning, but yet I convince whomever I'm going out with that I have this infinite bottled up ambition.

Speaker 1:          01:24:56       So not even faking the Rolex watch, this is not a tangible thing. I'm just sending her cues that I'm going places that all great ideas. I've got a lot of entrepreneurial spunk and my workout every day. I worked with drink wheat grass. I'm super healthy or meditate and soda my rapist. Yeah, that's a good question. Like who are you? You know, I always tell guys, you should aspire to be the man you pretend to be when you're trying to get laid. Like if you could just do they just be that guy all the time. Like you don't really, it's the best way to go. Right? Uh, but yeah, that is a, that's interesting. Like that is deceptive, right? If he's pretending to have all this really, uh, admirable behavior, one on one fakes orgasm and makes you think that you're a great lover and you have sex with her, she's alive. She raped me. So then I had sex with her. It was under the misconception that I was a great love of the first time when she faked an orgasm. So she's raping me that second time. Now when you were talking about evolutionary psychology, receiving a lot of criticism, what, what is it? What is this? You and you, you sort of glossed over it real quickly to make your point. Like where's the, where's the vast majority of this coming from? Yeah, that's a great question. So it comes from

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       different camps for different reasons, right? So you, so let's start, let's kind of break them up. Okay. So we can go to the religious folks, right? I mean that's obvious though, isn't it obvious that they would be the track? Obviously they're not going to look at things realistically because they have this, that blind spot. Let's talk about like professors, right? So then the professors typically will be one of, against several types. They'll be the social constructivists. Those are the guys who believe that everything's due to social construction. That what makes us human is that we transcend our biology, right? It's an argument for that though, isn't it? Well, we don't transcend our bile. We were not strictly biological animals would biological and cultural, but we certainly can't negate our biology, right? What they're basically arguing is that what differentiates us from all other life forms is that we transcend our biology, right?

Speaker 5:          01:26:55       So, so they're perfectly fine if you use an evolutionary explanation to explain the behavior of the mating behavior of the salamander, but don't apply that exact same phenomenon. What are the flies to humans, right? Because somehow we have, uh, you know, consciousness and we have higher order thinking and we're called church culture. And that's what makes us human, right? Uh, there are guys who, for example, professors who believed that evolution stops at the neck, so, so they're perfectly happy with a, you offering an evolutionary explanation for why we fingernails where we evolve opposable thumbs. That's fine. Why we've evolved the particular, uh, pancreas that we have, but don't apply it to anything above the neck, not dumbo. How behavior patterns or cultural personhood, who you are as a human being. Right? Right. Uh, there are some guys who, uh, don't have any ideological reasons for hating evolution psychology, but because they don't know much about evolution psychology, they typically will argue, oh, evolution has come up with all these fanciful post hoc stories.

Speaker 5:          01:27:59       And in a sense, the article that I wrote that I discussed on your show today seeks to address that. Then contrary to what people think, the, the standard of evidence that evolutionary scientists typically seek to meet prior to accepting an explanation is actually much, much higher than other sciences by the very nature of the epistemology of the field, by the very nature of how knowledge is created and generated an evolutionary theory. So for all sorts of reasons, reasons, none of which is valid, there's a long queue of frankly buffoons who despise evolutionary theory. Now the reality is that they're going to lose this battle, right? There will be a day when it will become by now to argue that humans are driven by evolutionary imperatives. And I already see it from my own scientific career. If I look at the antipathy that I felt that I faced 15 years ago versus today, it's very, very different.

Speaker 5:          01:28:57       Right? The antipathy that I felt from sometimes the same person, I could still have emails from somebody who wrote me 10 years ago thinking that my work was full of Shit, who's now inviting me to his university with all sorts of deference. And so that's the nature of science, right? It's auto corrective. And the reality is the cat's out of the bag. We, everything's evolutionary, right? I mean, we, by the way, we could talk about the range of fields where evolution has made its way in fields where you wouldn't typically think. So is that something that interests you that we can talk about that, but I want to keep going down this road for a little bit. Sure. I find it very fascinating when people oppose things that seem pretty obvious, right? And not only that, or unwilling to take into account that it might not be a case of either or, but it might be a case of there's a, uh, a bunch of combining factors and that evolution must certainly continue to play.

Speaker 5:          01:29:48       It's the idea that we've completely transcended evolution with culture and thinking and logic and language. It's insane. It doesn't make any sense. I don't know, forgive me if I've mentioned this on the show before, but again, it's, if I have it's worth repeating. Uh, I always talk about the interaction test framework. Interaction basically means everything's interaction. Most things aren't traction between our genes and our environment. Right? Right. As a matter of fact, genes get turned on or off as a function of environmental input, which is fascinating. Exactly. Evolution happens within an environment. So by its very nature, evolution itself recognizes the importance of the environment, right? So any, any, anybody who is, uh, who exhibits hatred or rejection of biology using those types of arguments, it's simply advertising and they know very little about biology. The reality is it's an interaction. And the example I like to give, the metaphor I give is the cake metaphor.

Speaker 5:          01:30:43       If you take the separate ingredients of a cake, here's the sugar, here's the exit as the baking soda, whatever, whatever the parts are, the butter, they're separate at first. Now you bake the cake. If I then ask you when you have the final kick in front of you, point to the sugar or point to the eggs, you can't. It's an inextricable mix. Them both. And that's a very good point. That's what we are. We are in an inextricable mix of our genes and our unique environments and our unique talents and our unique personhoods. The problem with much of the social sciences has been, and they're losing now by the day, has been that they've completely rejected biology as an any way relevant and explaining anything, mating criminality, a political choice. For example, there's a field called evolutionary politics or bio politics, which tries to infuse evolutionary theory within political science.

Speaker 5:          01:31:35       Well, no kidding. I mean what? What happens when we were making political choices? Suddenly our biology, she's just a matter. So evolutionary theory is relevant anywhere that you're studying biological agents. So what is the argument against this and what and why? How has someone got into a university level teaching this kind of bullshit? Right? So it comes from several sources. Uh, so maybe we could sort of point to a few of you ever debated anyone about this. Uh, and I mean I have in various forms, not necessarily in a public one on one like this, but I would like to see that, hook it up, make it happen. I would like to find somebody who opposes, you have read their stuff online and it's infuriating. It's unopposed. Like someone who writes a ridiculous blog and you know, you, you know right away what the motivation is.

Speaker 5:          01:32:23       Someone who is distorting reality to fit their own ridiculous view of the world. I mean, I've debated them and typically one of two ways, either through the review process where usually they're anonymous and oftentimes I'm in on this. So what, in a double blind review process, I don't know who they are, they don't know who I am, and then we're engaging in the debate, right? And oftentimes the paper gets rejected because they're the reviewer, they're the editor, and then they have the final say. So in that context of the Beta, or I've debated publicly, typically when I go after somebody on twitter who is espousing these kinds of stupidities, but I've never done it publicly in this way. Have you had a paper, a rejected that was logical and objective and made a lot of sense? Tons of times really. And what like give me an example one.

Speaker 5:          01:33:06       So the paper when I was talking to you about the, the tree of knowledge going down the tree sexual selection plan. So that, so I had a paper where I had looked at how much information do men and women look at before they either reject a mate or choose a mate, which I mentioned earlier, right? That paper originally I had sent it to a top journal and consumer psychology and to kind of just summarize the, the thing, the, the, the position, it was, well this is all biology. What does this have to do with psychology? So these very esteemed psychologist somehow thought that biology existed in a separate realm to psychology in a vacuum. You're brain exists in this other parallel. His influence, the body has no influence in the brain at all. Exactly. The other thing that they were upset about, cause they were talking about, well why is this person who was an otherwise be very patronizing was an otherwise clearly a bright behavioral scientists talking about sex differences when we should be looking at things that make us similar to one another.

Speaker 5:          01:34:09       Well, when you're talking about sex differences in mating behavior, your study sex differences, right? I mean it's a fundamental defining quality of humans that they are sexually dimorphic. They are innate differences between men and women. So he are people who did not want to accept that they were sex differences between men and women. And they didn't want to accept that biology has something important to say about psychology. Right now. If I speak to neuroscientists, if I speak to bio psychologists, they would listen to my stuff and say, well yeah, no kidding. So, so in a sense I've existed in a fractured life in my academic life. If I am navigating amongst my natural science colleagues, then they're all like, Oh yeah, I love your stuff. You know, I love you. If I navigate amongst my social science friends, while they're

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       less loving and less receptive, but they're coming around. So I think the problem stems from the empty slate premise, the idea that we are born with empty minds that are only subsequently failed by a wide range by a cascading number of, that's a nonsensical isn't it? It is. But it also, I have a problem with someone saying, why are you looking at this instead of looking at that? Right. Well looking at this, it just because you're looking at something, it doesn't make it so that you can't understand why we were all similar in many ways, but the denial of these preferences of these genetic preferences of these evolutionary tendencies, that's not scientific at all like that. That is, that's really preposterous. And the fact that that's being taught to kids and that they go leave these institutions with these thoughts in their head that are based on a bunch of people that have never even existed in the outside world.

Speaker 1:          01:35:53       That's what's fucked up about schools and a lot of ways chair is there going from learning by these people to becoming one of these people teaching in these schools and never existing, uh, John gigantic percentage never existing outside of academia. Absolutely. So to speak, to your point about if I ever faced this type of antipathy and so on, I gave two talks. One of my first book came out at a university in the psychology department and in the business school they were back to back to on two separate days. So this was a talk on my book. How do you Darwin eyes, the field of consumer behavior. I gave it in the psychology department first, which is made up of a lot of people who have background in neurosciences, in biology and they all listened and said, yeah, beautiful. No kidding. I mean, of course, to study our consumer Tory nature, we have to understand the biological impulses that drive us.

Speaker 1:          01:36:42       Great. Exact same talk the next day in the business school. This is one of the top universities in the world. I couldn't get through a single sentence. Why? Because of the amount of hostility that I faced in the business school, the business school. Why Business? So I think so. This is a very interesting question. So I think business practitioners, in other words, business people, not business academics actually loved by work or historically he loved my work because they're not vested in a particular paradigm. All they care ideology, they care about results. What works right or earns the money. Exactly. You're going to tell me what are the evolutionary triggers for me to develop a more effective advertising campaign. I'm in, I'm in talk to me professor side. I don't give a shit about your paradigmatic fights in academia, but yes, by the act, but the academics who've been vested in social constructivism or an cultural relativism, every culture is relative. There are no human universals. There is no shared human nature. There is no shared biological heritage. Then I come in on my biology train and I'm dangerous. We've got to shut this guy down. Now the reality is if you're sufficiently confident about what you're doing, you ride out that storm. And Luckily

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       for me, you know, now 20 years into the game, uh, more people are coming to seeing things in the way that I'm saying him. But it's taken a lot of dog fighting to convince people, uh, of, of the veracity of what I'm saying. So when you were giving these speeches and you're being interrupted, yeah. Like what are they saying? No example. Okay, I'll get the first one. How do you explain homosexuality? Right? Because their first instinct, no pun intended, instincts as an evolutionary term, uh, they, they want to show that if everything is evolutionary, if everything is adaptive, then how could you explain something like homosexuality, which by definition is Darwinian, could the socket that end? Right? Well, then I say, well, there are some evolutionary theories that try to explain homosexuality, but that's not really the focus of my talk tonight. Can I just go on?

Speaker 5:          01:38:46       And he explained suicide. Here's the other. Now, if we are these adaptive creatures that, that have this survival instinct, how do you explain the fact that there is an epidemiology of suicide? Why would somebody to take their own life? So, uh, if I started, it's pretty easy to describe. I don't think I'd have a problem with no, but then imagine if this goes on for every syllable that I authored, right? So these are students that are interrupting all these up, but he's a professor professors, as a matter of fact. That's so rude. Yeah. So two points I'll make the, the more senior, the person in the room, the more hostile they were really. So the doctoral students who took me out to lunch after, we're all like, Oh man, I love your stuff. Professors up. Now why? Again, anecdotally we can understand why because the more senior professors are vested in their paradigms, therefore their brains are closed to any ideas that might challenge the status quo.

Speaker 5:          01:39:44       The doctoral student who still surfing, who's surfing at the buffet of ideas is open to the idea. Oh yeah. Biology seems to make sense. The second thing that I'll point when you said it's very rude. I actually got upset and I'll just try to stay with the Corum and politeness, but as we were leaving, I took a couple of those senior folks and I said, you know, what is the point of inviting me here and wasting your money and our respective time by not giving me a chance to get through my talk? Would it make more sense to give me the forum? And then at the end of the day, if you decide that it's not worthwhile, you throw it in the garbage, but at least you've given, you've given me the opportunity to share my ideas with you. Oh No, no professor side you mis mistook are interruptions is because we were so engaged.

Speaker 5:          01:40:26       I said, well, it can't be really engaged when you're not allowing me to finish the syllable. Well, not only that, it's really simple to take notes and then at the end of it ask me questions. Right. I mean, why did they feel like they have the right to interrupt your speech? That's a great question. I usually ask people to hold off their questions till the q and a period, but I don't know why, but especially in business schools and it's certainly in some of the top business schools, there's this culture of very sort of Alpha maleness where you hammer at the person you, you because you, you're trying to one up them up and it's very, there's a great story on Richard. Do you know who Richard Feinman is? Yes. The Great Nobel Prize winning physicists. I think I read it in his book. Uh, surely. You must be joking, Mister Feynman.

Speaker 5:          01:41:10       Uh, so I hope I don't watch the story, but the story goes something like this. He's giving his sort of pre final dissertation talk is sort of departmental talk. He's still a doctoral student at Princeton and fun of the WHO's who of leading physicists throughout. I mean, Einstein is there and everybody's there and as he's giving his talk as a young doctoral student, there is this one professor who's interrupting him and the way that those folks were interrupting me at that school and from the corner somewhere, apparently Albert Einstein says, don't you think we owe the young men the respect to let him finish speaking? And then I'm sure at the end of his talk you'll have plenty of opportunities to answer us. And then after that nobody said anything. So I think it's part of that baboons sort of gorilla thing. I'm going to show you that I'm the smartest guy in the room.

Speaker 5:          01:41:57       So you're typically see it from not the truly elite, the truly elite don't have to do this, but the guys just below want to show that they're the toughest guys in the prison yard and therefore they interrupt you, they harass you, they heckle, you know, it's so on the same type of people that would go after you with like a hate blog. Exactly. Professors that are just fringe intellectuals that just really aren't that really that smart, but they've achieved this notoriety. And a a status because of the fact they're teaching at some school. Can I mention one such got, sure. A grand buffoon, peas, Ed Meyers. Do you know that? Yeah, I know that is one of the most execrable creatures that has ever walked academia. I don't know him personally well, but he's the exact type of guy who exhibits those types of behaviors. He has an incredibly successful science blog hat off hat tip to him for having that forum, but all he does all day is attack fellow scientists an extra ordinarily, you know, poisonous manners.

Speaker 5:          01:43:04       It's never respectful. Certainly evolutionary psychologists, we're all lobotomized idiots who are faking science. He's the real scientists. All of us are just idiots who couldn't, you know, are borderline illiterates. And the reality is the last time that he ever published something was probably around the period of the renaissance and yet he feels perfectly comfortable criticizing folks who are infinitely more productive than him. And I only call him out, not, I don't know him, but I just despise this type of bullying. This is kind of arrogance when they are incredibly honest, hardworking scientists that in their best way are trying to understand the world. But here's this guy who's got a huge soapbox. I mean, I think over a hundred million views and visitors on his side. So he's got a big platform.

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       He's just denigrating everybody. There's a lot of, um, there's the slot out action in that. Like there's, there's a lot of eyes. If you, if you're one of those people that writes a hate blog, you can get a lot of attention doing that. And some people become very addicted to attention and if you notice, they start repeating those patterns and blogging constantly over and over again. And then also what he also does is anybody who opposes him, he deletes them from the comments, even if they're, even if they're respectful, if you, you're an idiot, you don't know what you're talking about and gets rid of any, I became aware of him because that whole Michael Shermer debacle. Yes. The rape thing, right? Yeah. Well, he accused Michael Shermer of rape because he had sex with a woman a consensually while they were both intoxicated at a conference.

Speaker 3:          01:44:38       I think. Yeah, see, oh, that's how you got to know him. Like, yeah, well that's how I heard of them. Right. You know, and just, and it was the way it was done was so reckless and so uninformed. Like you don't know what happened unless he were there. And also there's photos of Michael Shermer and the girl's smiling weeks after this incident. It was all, it's all very sorted and its ugliness, right? It's just to understand what he gets out of this sort of frivolous, diabolical ugliness. It's a tension. It's a tension maybe. Yeah. It gets attention. And you know, he is the Grand Poobah of the retarded social justice warriors. Very true. That's a, there's a lot of people like that out there. And there's, again, there's a lot of attention in doing something like that. Um, you know, and if, unfortunately it negates some really good points that they might have, might have about a bunch of different issues because you have to look at it through the lens of this really poisoned his person.

Speaker 5:          01:45:35       Exactly right. You know, I, the first I had heard of him, uh, was there was an incident that happened on psychology today with a gentleman by the name of Satoshi Kanazawa. Are you familiar with him? No. So [inaudible] is a professor, an evolutionary psychologist at the London School of Economics. It's a very, very prestigious school in London, England, uh, who was a very popular blogger at cycle at psychology today. But he had a very sort of bombastic style of writing that sort of drew a lot of attention because of the way he phrased things. And, but, but I guess he thought that he was so popular that he was sort of untouchable. And at one point he wrote a blog article summarizing somebody else's work, looking at racial differences in attractiveness. So for example, who's most attractive white women or black women, white men or black men? And one of the results from that Dataset, this wasn't his own study, he was summarizing somebody else's water, was that black women had been rated as less attractive than white women.

Speaker 5:          01:46:35       And he gave some, I guess, speculative reasons as to why that might be. So that caused a huge, you know, fewer. Uh, he's a racist, but he's Japanese by the way. Uh, he's a racist. He hates blacks. He hates this. He was, he, they tried to get him out of a psychologist today. They eventually kicked him out. They tried to revoke, they started a petition to try to revoke his tenure at London School of Economics. But I'll mention two points. Number one, uh, bees at meyers takes this example and says, look, here's what evolution psychology is. Here's this racist who happens to be an evolution psychologist. All evolution psychologists are racist. Well, I mean, that's what racism usually is, right? Give me a generalization. I know a friend who is Jewish and who was caught cheating on his taxes, that that shows you Jews cheat when it comes to money because they're always looking to make the most money.

Speaker 5:          01:47:27       That's what happens with those jobs, right? So he doesn't see the irony of that. So then I wrote an article, which I frankly, if you don't want me to say, it took a lot of courage where I, and you could probably pull it up while you could pull it up if you wanted, where I basically argued that to purge a blogger would set a very dangerous precedent, right? If you disagree with whatever Satoshi Kanazawa saying, let his words come back to haunt him, right? His words will be there. If the are truly racist, if he is espousing racial theories that are pure quackery, that will be the biggest punishment he could suffer. But to remove him from the discourse, the public arena of ideas sets a very dangerous precedent precedent. Now, guess what happened? A lot of my academic colleagues wrote to me privately said, my God, thank you for having the courage to write that article. That's exactly what I thought. But I didn't want to write the article because then people might think that I'm supporting Satoshi. So it shows you that why would this of people, to me it seemed very natural to write that article. I don't give a shit. I mean I know what's right and I'm going to support that principle, which is you don't ban people based on ideas that they write. Let their ideas come back to haunt them if they are bad ideas. Not only that, right.

Speaker 3:          01:48:41       Why is it okay to say that it, there's a, there's an evolutionary desire for women to breed with an Alpha male, like one of these romance novel guys. Right. Why is it okay to say that women are more inclined to favor taller men with broader shoulders and longer or whatever the fuck it is or why is it okay to say that women are less attractive to obese short men? Why is it okay to say that women or or that men would be less attractive to obese women, which is a fact, but as soon as you involve race, that's it. Then you're not allowed to look at the actual statistics. You're not allowed to look at the real numbers. Have you noticed by the way, that the a hundred meters was very racist this year wasn't racist. How so? Black people, one,

Speaker 5:          01:49:30       there were no Lebanese Jews who are overweight that we're in the final, ah, there was no proper representation of the rich tapestry of humanity. Why were they all black? That was, that was clearly racist. We're talking about an athletic event. We're not talking about sex, right? It's, it's, it's all sorted

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       in many ways. Um, you could make the argument that there are women that are far more beautiful than any of that are black, that are far more beautiful than any white woman that, you know, I mean, there's a broad range of attractiveness and all sorts of different, um, uh, different races and creeds and different parts of the world and is also be different. People have different things that they're attracted to. Sure. Like some people are attracted to short Asian women. Some people are attracted to tall women from Norway. You know, there's a lot of variety in what people, personal preference. Sure. But when you're just looking at sheer numbers and which is, I'm sure he wasn't saying black women are completely unattractive. Absolutely not. That's in fact, I think in the same study, if I'm not mistaken, he pointed to the fact that black men had been at scored as more attractive.

Speaker 1:          01:50:37       So the result that demonstrates a finding that is racially acceptable is gleaned over the one that is unacceptable then makes him a Kkk Nazi. He supposed to do what he's supposed to ignore the statistics. Exactly. Incidentally, the, the, the, the, the king on this issue as a gentleman by the name of Phillip Rushton, who's now passed away a few years ago, who was a Canadian psychologist who spent his career studying racial differences specifically, he studied, uh, differences in Iq. And I actually had a personal anecdote with him because early on in my career, uh, I think two years into my original professorship, I think it was [inaudible] 96 I was giving a talk at a conference and this hall had maybe 50 a hundred people. And I hadn't looked at who were the other speakers in my session, but I noticed that people were very, seemed there's a lot of poison in the air and it turned out I should have maybe checked before going into the hall, that the gentleman who was speaking immediately before me was this gentleman Phillip Rushton and he's going to talk about, um, a cranial capacity postmortal carrying capacity of black men, black women, white men, white women.

Speaker 1:          01:51:49       And then he would show some racial differences. We forget everybody riled up. And this was probably the only time ever where I was about to give a talk where I was genuinely terrified because I thought that I would just get lynched by proxy because I'm, I'm the next guy in line and they just going to kill me just because I was next on the same stage as him. The good news for me is that after he finished his stock, so the room, let's say I had 1500 people, he finishes a stock. I'm getting ready to go up about 425 out of the 1500 leave to follow him. And his new yelled at him to yell at him to kill her. And there's maybe like 75 people in the, in a room of, and I was actually very happy that there were so few. So few people that had stayed at my talk undeniable physical differences in human beings to, to somehow or another say that bringing those up is racist, is really strange.

Speaker 1:          01:52:36       Like there's just some undeniable physical differences in bone structure, bone density. There's just some thing, like for instance, uh, African American women, uh, tend to have a higher bone density and similar bone density to a Caucasian men, which is very rare. Like in women, it's not the same like African American women have denser bones, uh, per capita. You know, normally rather you've got on average, just in general, just in general, you know, who and who knows what the origin of that. I mean, you could go into that from an evolutionary standpoint and try to figure out what part of the world they come from, what you know, what their ancestors did, what would have been the selection pressures that would have resulted in this indication that they're fascinating conversation. Exactly what Phillip Rushton, you still have new, he used to argue, look, I'm not a racist, I don't have an agenda.

Speaker 1:          01:53:25       I follow an interesting line of questions. Yes. And here's the data. Now I've asked people who were friends with him privately, so, so what is the deal on the gentleman? Is he racist? Is he not? And I've never been told by anybody that he was a racist. But here's where I'm confused. If you're showing actual skulls and you're actually measuring cranial capacity, are you not allowed to do that? Are you not allowed to look at the differences between Asian people and the Norwegian people? Or are people from Antarctica versus how you not allowed to do that? Because it seems kind of crazy if you're not allowed to. So that's part of, there's a great paper that was published I think in 2005 or 2006 either in science or nature. I love the title of the paper. I think it's forbidden knowledge and it's specifically sort of breaks down the types of research questions that if you want to have a viable career as a scientist, you should stay away from.

Speaker 1:          01:54:24       And I think pretty much on top of that list is studying racial differences, especially racial differences that might eventually point to a finding that is politically incorrect. Right? That's an excellent way for you to become the pariah of academia, if not more generally the public. And so, yeah, it's growth. I actually did a sad truth clip on my youtube channel where I talked about, you know, facts are not racist, right? I mean w [inaudible] and boolean logic and mathematical logic. You'd take a statement and it's either true or false, it has a binary value one or zero, right? I mean, that's how we create circuitry, architectural circuitry of a computer, right? It has a truth value. Yes. No. Right? So the idea that a statement is racist scientifically, no, it's either false or not false or provisionally true. Uh, but apparently the argument from the other camp is the mere fact that you asked these questions suggest that there must be a reason that is nefarious for you to ask these questions. What is the value in asking that question? So they sort of infer a nefarious motive to you going down that alley. Yeah, but you can't do that. And because it's an appeal to ignorance, you, you're, you're saying that let's all, let's all feign

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       ignorance and not look at the actual facts of just the physical bodies of human beings and that they vary based on climate based on, you know, what, what area of the world, what, what the people were up to that were living there for generation after generation that led to the genetics expressing themselves and the way they do in 2016 it's, it's crazy, but it's weird. It's weird. And it's, it's almost like in response to what they believe to be illogical criticism. That's inevitable. It's like this illogical criticism is inevitable. So hedge your bets early and say there's no difference between the sexes. There's no difference between the races. I don't want to get in any arguments. I want tenure. I want just to want to keep promoting ignorance at an institution of learning Zap, which is bananas.

Speaker 5:          01:56:32       Is it that the, that's how you remember already were asking me. So who are some of these, the tractors of evolutionary psychology? So what you just mentioned kind of can bring us back to that point. Some of the early proponents of sort of this anti evolutionary position came from anthropologists who saw the potential for biology being misused or Darwinian theory to be misused, right? So the Nazis can, can, can refer to, you know, Darwinian theory. There's a, there's a struggle between the races and we are the areas the Jews lost. So what's wrong with getting rid of them? That's Darwinian. Of course, it has nothing to do with Darwinian theory, but I the assert the theory for my nefarious pursuits. A British class elitists said, hey, there's a struggle between the uh, classes. We are the upper class. Who cares if the lower class are eliminated?

Speaker 5:          01:57:23       If we don't fund them, if we don't give them healthcare, if we don't educate them, that's natural selection. You Genesis said the same thing. You know what's wrong if we sterilize, uh, people who are dull, you know, mentally deficient people who are maybe a bit too dark, people who are homosexual, hey that's cleaning out the gene pool. Hey that's Darwinian, right? So some anthropologists thought, well, you know, there is going to be misuse of biology. So let's now create a new world view built on bullshit. So the edifice is built on bullshit after bullshit, but at least there won't be an opportunity for people to otherwise misuse biology. And so how do they express that? They created a narrative that basically says that cultural relativism is what? The fines, humanity. Every culture is unique. Every culture is different. There is no such thing as human universals.

Speaker 5:          01:58:13       Cause that would necessitate biological commonalities which we don't accept. And so therefore for a hundred years, anthropology departments have been built on an edifice of pure bullshit, at least the cultural anthropologists. The Bio anthropologists recognize biology. But the cultural anthropologists are driven by a premise of cultural relativism, which incidentally on our common friend Sam Harris, it tells a great story about moral relativism. And I hope I don't watch the story, but apparently he was at a conference somewhere where he had a chance to speak to the bioethicist who is sitting on the president's commission on bioethics. And she apparently is a sort of moral relativist stipe. And he asks her, are you sure that there are no universal moral truths? I mean, are you not able to pronounce a position on whether if there were a culture where people were told that every fourth child has to have his eyes gouged so that he can walk towards the light without eyes, would you support?

Speaker 5:          01:59:11       Well, who am I to judge? So this bio ethicists was unable to pass a moral judgment as to whether if you had a religious narrative that says that every fourth child should have his eyes gouged out, she couldn't pronounce the position. And the reason why she couldn't, she because she is shackled, she's intellectually shackled by the narrative of cultural relativism. Who are we to judge other culture. It's the lack of criticism for things like female genital mutilation in the Islam and that's why the ca strata and chief Justin true though. That's why when he was not before he was prime minister, when he was a minister in parliament, he got very upset when somebody referred to child bride honor, killing, genital mutilation, throwing acid in their faces when they refuse marriage, whatever. Uh, somebody referred to these practices as barbaric and there is no place for the Mccain society.

Speaker 5:          02:00:05       He didn't get upset by those practices. He got upset by the other politician referring to them as barbera. Is that true? That is true. Look it up. Then he later came out and you know, hedged and so on. Of course after criticism of course, but he's responding to that standard social justice warrior sort of creed. He is the king and we've talked about this I think last time on the show briefly. He is the king of the social justice warriors. He is taking down Canada to meet where Sweden and the rest of the European hell holes are not becoming as fast as he can. Well, what is his motivation? I think he's, I don't, I don't think it's because he's an evil guy who you know has nefarious ulterior motives. I think he is simply profoundly misguided because of all the bullshit that you and I have talked about through the years.

Speaker 5:          02:00:53       He comes from a environment of social justice warriors. His Dad was the architect. Pure true though was the architect of multiculturalism and Canada. Now, multiculturalism, as we may or may not have discussed on the show before, has two different meanings. We could talk about multiculturalism. As you know, there are many cultures in Orange County that's multicultural but multiculturalism as a political philosophy, as the idea that when people come to your land you don't ask them to assimilate. You rejoice in the fact that everybody has their unique, distinct cultures where they can express themselves in any way that they can. Well, of course in some cases that's fine. When it comes to cuisine, it's not fine when it comes to let's cut off some cliteracy his right, I don't where

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       it's not fine when it comes to genocidal hatred of the Jews honor killings and on it. But from his perspective, he is simply shackled by his inability to have a clear moral compass that says this is right, this is wrong. Because all he sees as the parasites in his brain that says, who am I to judge? Well judge Asshole, they are thumb some things that are right and some things that are wrong. And when we're talking about things like people, uh, objecting to the analysis of cranial capacity of different people, I could see why some people would be uncomfortable with that because I could see how some people would perceive that as being some sort of a justification for racism. And so there was stand, but as a person who is not racist, I'm not racist. I don't think you are either. We, when we're discussing this, it becomes a matter of just being a very curious biological trait, right?

Speaker 3:          02:02:35       And it doesn't make someone superior or inferior. It makes someone different. And it's fascinating to me because I'm looking at the human evolution of the species as being this massive complex algorithm that's been going on since the beginning of single celled organisms branching off into multicell organism. So there's has been this process of change and what has made this process so that people that live in Iceland are so big. You know, you look at those men that when those strong man competitions, how many of them are from fucking Iceland? It's crazy. Like what is that? What it was it viking genetics. Okay, well what, tell me what happened. Why are their bones so big? Why they're so tall? Like what is it? What is it about certain people in Africa? Marathon runners are always from east Africa. Yeah. Was it West Africa? No, east Africa. Which ones is West Africa?

Speaker 3:          02:03:25       Africa as the sprinters. That's funny, isn't it? Their muscles structures are very different. Right? Slow twitch versus the longer, so the east African soul, Ethiopians and Eritreans and so on, Kenyans have these elevated bodies that are just built for a long distance. The other guys are packed muscles. Right? Uh, that's why you get those differences that is not viewed as racist because ultimately you're talking about success. Success, right? On the other hand, if you talk about race a as somehow less good at something than race be and where race a scores high on the victimology Olympics, forgive the pun and you're screwed, you, that there was a fantastic radiolab podcast that dealt with, uh, people from one particular part of the world that were amazing at running. And uh, they were talking about their ability to endure pain because of the rituals that they were.

Speaker 3:          02:04:16       Uh, they had to endure the rites of passage as Madison there, their circumcision done with like sharp sticks and having to crawl naked through thorn bushes and, and like really dark, dark shit that they had to do. And it was interesting because one guy who had gone through that and became this unbelievably successful runner and just had this unbelievable ability to shut off the pain signal, like to ignore it, but he was also talking about who we wouldn't want his son to go through that same process and that he believes that the benefits are not worth it. And that remember what culture that was. Um, I do not, uh, Jamie could probably pull that up. He's probably looking it up right now, but it was a, an unfortunately, he's like, I listen to like five podcasts a day, so probably a fucking million podcasts ago.

Speaker 3:          02:04:58       What is it going Kenyan runners? There's a Kenyan, but it's a particular part of Kenya is a very small population of people by the way, that engage in this like really brutal ritual of manhood, a rite of passage. It's really, um, it's, it's, it's, it is fascinating how the, is this it right here? Okay. Yes. Yes. Collagen, Collagen people pursue, pursue, produced an astonishing number of great long distance runners. Subpopulation of Kenyans. Yeah. Those, that practice, those rites of passage. Yeah. Yeah. So it's not just biology with them, but it's also this unbelievable ability to, to die. And it's called the, the actual episodes called cut and run because it's about circumcision, about what they're forced to do while they have a stick poking through their dick. It's really hardcore. And that this ability to shut off pain and ability to endure is a, a, a key factor in their ability to succeed in running that it's a mental toughness thing as well.

Speaker 3:          02:06:00       Like they've maybe perhaps turned on this aspect of their brain and he's like, yeah. And have you, have you heard of this other rite of passage? I, I talk about this one of my books that with the bull ants? Yes. Yes. Yeah. I know a guy who's been bitten by one. My friend Steve, my friend Steve was in Bolivia. He was there filming his show called meat eater and he went down there and uh, he got a bullet ant bite in his foot and he said it was so unbelievably scores the high. So there's a paint quotient, whatever. I don't know the exact metric, but apparently the bullet ant scores the highest on that. Yeah. And so this particular peoples in their rite of passage, uh, you could probably pull, they take a glove, they take gloves, they said date the, the ants. When the ants wake up, they start stinging the hands that are in those gloves.

Speaker 3:          02:06:52       So they are multiple of these bites, dozens all over the globe, all over the glove. And they have to do that ritual I think if I'm not mistaken 20 times before they are accepted as man or someone who could take a fucking been there you go there you, Jesus Christ, the amount of pain that you would endure it by doing that. It's just the, there was a guy from Australia that did it for a, some sort of a television special and one of going to the hospital. But uh, you, you, you see the pain in his face while he's doing it credible. They say it's like getting your hand slammed in a car door 24 hours a day. Incredible. Yeah. And it lasts a long time. It lasts for hours. What was interesting is my friend Steve, he got stung

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       by this bullet and he says, unbelievably painful for about an hour or two hours. Like where you just like, you can't believe how much pain you're in during. And then he said after that he could remember which ankle got stung. No, just goes away. It goes away. And then he's just walking through the woods with these people. The, um, I'm trying to remember the name of the people in Amazon via, yes. We'll try to remember the name of these people that he was. Um, I don't remember. Anyways, speaking of bullets, can I tell you another story short on this vacation? So I have a FBI special agent friend here in southern California, and so I know Fred, Fred. Oh, you've met him. That's true. That's right. That's right. So, uh, so his last name now I won't, I won't. Actually, we'd met Fred and I met another gentleman who is a CIA operative and we went out that conversation should young.

Speaker 1:          02:08:31       Oh boy. Uh, maybe I'll give a little few hence later. But anyways, he took me out to a, cause we've talked about bullets. I asked him if we could go to a shooting range and he said, sure, let's do it. So he brought his whole arsenal of FBI stuff and he had another friend with him who was a security type guy. And so I went shooting for the first time ever. Even though I've never shot a gun before. No. Even though I've grown up in the Lebanese civil war and I had held the, I think it was a question Kalashnikov. Uh, I'd never fired a gun. Wow. It was something that's interesting. Yeah. I guess you shoot your hunt, correct? Yeah. But you hunt with a bow and Arrow, correct. Hunt with a rifle you've had. Okay. Yeah. All these animals you see around your shot with a rifle, the rifle, that one, that one, the one outside with the shot that with a rifle too.

Speaker 1:          02:09:19       Right. So I've shot things with both bone marrow and rifle. So when was the first time that you ever shot? Four years ago. Well, no, not just guns. Yeah, long time ago. A long time ago. Yeah. It was unbelievable. It was really, I mean it's a lot more, he told me actually, he said, look, I'll, I'll book the range for two hours and either you'll be the type of guy who go there and we'll use the two hours or you'll shoot once and you'll say, this is not for me. I don't like it and we'll leave. Cause I was asking him what should my wife gets come back to pick me up at? Well I turned out that I stayed for the full two hours, but I can understand sort of the, the response that people might have where, because the, it's a lot more powerful than you think.

Speaker 1:          02:10:02       Right? I mean, you could speak to this probably better than I can. Uh, I shot also the submachine gun, the FBI something. I found that a lot easier because it's kind of recoil recoil, but the guns and I think that would have different calibers. 2145. I don't remember the exact numbers. Uh, wow. There, that's why I have some really powerful rifles that were even different. I'm sure that anything you shot, I have some hunting rifles, like a 300 win mag that is like getting punched in the shoulder. Every time you, you, you, you shoot it because it's designed to shoot Moose and elk and big giant animals. It's a heavy

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       fee, really strong, powerful round and a, yeah, the vulnerability that you feel when that trigger goes off and you hear that boom. And I'm sure you're wearing your head gear, your guards, which you really have to, it's so important. There's so many people out there that hunt and shoot without ear protection and they wind up having tendonitis or tinnitus and yeah, all sorts of issues with their hearing. It's so bad for you. Well, what he, what was interesting is when before we went and he gave me maybe a 10 15 minute safety mini lecture, the main one that he gave, I mean this is of course live, this is not, these are live bullets. I mean are lethal. And he said, the number one thing you do is when you, the gun, the gun barrel always points to, because what happens is he said, you know, people pick it up and start doing yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:11:21       Gesture with it. And so and so to sort of make sure that I wouldn't commit such an error. I said, here's what we're going to institute as I do every action. I am verbally going to describe it. Ah, that's smart. And that really sort of soften us. Why should that the fear? Because then he's listening. Okay, I'm not cut. For example, he told me after you shoot, take your finger out of the trigger. It's a trigger discipline. Exactly. So then I would speak it and by speaking it, it sort of gave me the discipline to never make an error. But anyways, it was a very smart, they should actually teach people to think. So yeah, I think that your method is probably something that people should adopt as very intelligent. You know where it comes from, actually it comes from some of my research. There's, there's a, there's a methodology called verbal protocols.

Speaker 4:          02:12:08       So what when you're doing research, you could either ask people to fill out something. So that's where you're only interested in the output, right? Please watch this stimulus and tell me on a scale what you think, right? Or sometimes I'm interested in the process that you're going through as you're doing something. So in that case, I will have a recorder and I will ask for your verbal protocols. Verbalize what you're doing as you're doing it. What that does is it basically yields very rich data, but that, that is a real bitch to analyze because you're not analyzing numbers on a scale of one to seven, you're not agonizing, uh, spikes of testosterone. You actually have to go through these huge transcripts of verbalizations. You know what it also does, it forces you to exist in the conscious mind versus the reactive mind. You are consciously engaging in a process. So like there's a, there's a thing called target panic that many, uh, archer's a face and a, it's a huge issue because of nerves, especially people that aren't used to um, performing under nerves. They go into this really almost like a tunnel vision sort of estate and they start panicking and they just want to shoot the shot as quick as possible. And so they make a lot of errors that make a lot of, cause. There's a lot of things involved in shooting a bow and Arrow correctly, bowen arrows.

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       It's so, it takes so much more disciplined than it does to shoot a rifle because of the rifle. Essentially what you have to do is have your face in the proper position, put your finger on the trigger and squeeze. So the shot goes off almost as a surprise. And if as long as you're looking through the, um, the scope correctly, you have your, your rifle centered in or you have a, your rifle, um, cited incorrectly, it should hit where you want to aim it. If the rifle was accurate with a bow and Arrow, there's so many different anchor points. The, you have to have the string touching the tip of your nose. You have to have your hand the exact same place every time. You have to have practice countless times. You have to make sure that you're holding your shoulder, your front shoulder, and the right position in your hand has to be holding the bone, a very specific position where you're not talking the bowl left and right.

Speaker 3:          02:14:16       And so when you go through your shot process, you go through these, this checkpoint in your mind, very like I tell when I do it by myself, I say it, I say, okay, and the right position, front shoulder position, and say it in your mind. Say it out loud. Okay. I say it out loud. And then when I go through it in a, in a hunting scenario where obviously you have to keep your mouth shut, I go through that same checklist in my mind and that sort of in many ways prevents a lot of the panic because um, that sort of panic exists in the conscious mind. You Start Thinking, oh my God, here we go. Oh my God, I can't believe it's happening. Don't fuck this up. Don't fuck this up. Ah, you fuck it up. And it's because of this reaction to the overwhelming, unusual stimulation of the event, of the panic sets in. And you succumb to that unusual pressure.

Speaker 5:          02:15:09       Yeah. So the portal causes, I'm talking about the income of two varieties is what's called concurrent protocols or retro spective protocols. Concurrent protocols is where you verbalize as you're doing the task, the, the, the benefit of that is that it's, it's live, it's, it's top of mind, right? The downside is that sometimes by asking a participant to verbalize, it actually changes their cognitive process. Sure. So then you might go to retrospective protocol, which is now tell me in details how you did the thing. And now the benefit there is that you don't have that, uh, that, uh, interference. But the downside of course, is that you have memory loss. You don't remember the specifics. Or you also have people who fill in stuff. That's bullshit, right? Oh, now the guy wants me to justify how I went and did it. Now let me just fill in stuff. But that's not really what I did. So as is true in most of these methodological choices, when you're making these scientific decisions, there is no absolute optimal strategy. There's always pros and cons to any methodology you use.

Speaker 3:          02:16:20       Yeah, and I think there's also something that happens to people when they do something so many times where it becomes a subconscious action. Right? And then when you ask him to verbalize what the steps are, oftentimes they don't know because they've programmed it into their mind like electricity. If I asked you to describe in exact detail what is the process that you tie your shoes with? Right? Like which hand goes first, which finger goes under, where you'd be like, um, how do I do it? Okay, I take the, but when you tie your shoes, you just go, Bro, whoops. Caught it. Right. You know, you just go through this storm standard process. If that happens with martial artists a lot, there's a lot of martial artists that have certain techniques that they've gotten down to a science. But then when you ask them to teach it, you say, okay, what are you doing first?

Speaker 3:          02:17:05       Are you doing this first shot? And they go, Huh, um, I'm not sure. And they literally don't know. I've, I've talked to that with certain archers to certain artists. I've asked them, are you looking at the, the site first or are you looking at the target first? We know when you released the Arrow, are you looking at the target or the site? They don't know. You don't know where it falls into this sort of subconscious state where they've made repetition. So they've, they've repeated the process so many times they've made this repetition cemented in their subconscious where they could just just sort of go into this Zombie state.

Speaker 5:          02:17:39       You know, it's funny, I, I felt that recently trying to play pickup soccer. Ah, it's going to speak to that authenticity and exactly how you're saying. So when I was a young guy, young player who can, you know, accelerate past players as if it's nothing, it's a natural thing. I don't think about it. My Body reacts and if you asked me to tell you how I shifted left and right, I couldn't tell you now is a much older and much heavier. Those moves that I tried to do, I no longer had the automatic ability. So actually my brain was trying to think, oh, I better turn right, but be careful because my knee is a bit weak. And so I actually felt the difference and the automaticity response, Ah, if only by virtue of being much older and much heavier. Right? So there you go. 20 years ago I could have probably not been able to tell you how I did this today. I could tell you how I did it because it was a slow as a turtle. Ah, that's funny.

Speaker 3:          02:18:39       Well, that exists in a, in fighting for sure. You drill these moments over and over into your mind so that when you're fighting, they actually just come out subconsciously or they come out without conscious thought because you don't really have the time to say, okay, I'm going to slip this right hand and throw the left to the body. The, the, the right high kick. It has to sort of be an automatic response, right? So you have to be able to go into this zen state, which is fine in these big movements. He's explosive movements like a martial arts thing. But in terms of like an archery thing, you don't want fast, big twitching, explosive movements to come out automatically. What you want is a very controlled process. Will you maintain very strict form and you stay calm. And so when that sort of a process going over this conscious shot making process is probably better for you.

Speaker 3:          02:19:30       Right. Cool. Are you still fighting? No. No. That's really not good for, you know what I mean? Even as a spotter, Jujitsu only, you know, that's, and I haven't done that in over a year. Okay. But it's just because of a back injury that I've been dealing with, but it's pretty much gone now. But sparring as far as like kickboxing, sparring, I gave that up many, many years ago. It's just even sparring for fun. Even just a, even you have to like really be sure of the person you're doing it with because every single time you get tagged, if you looked at your body or your brain rather as um, uh, a punch card, like say you have a hundred holes to punch and once you punch through those hundred holes, you're fucked. Right. And you might get away with a couple of holes. You might get away with three or four or five or 10 or 20.

Speaker 3:          02:20:15       This is the whole nfl. Yeah, it had been 100%, 100% and, but it pertains to a lot of things. And even soccer players would the head, the heading, which is insane, you would never meet. Imagine like for years, for decades, rather, we had no idea that heading a ball could have detrimental effects. But now we're finding out that certain soccer players who consistently headed the ball over a long career develop all sorts of cognitive issues with memory, impulsiveness, all the same sort of symptoms that I find from fighters. Incredible. It's amazing because it's not a concussion thing. It's a sub concussive trauma thing where you're constantly engaging that connective tissue inside your brain to try to stabilize the brain. Is it swashes around inside your skull and it starts failing and then the, the damage of your brain moving around inside of there starts accumulating.

Speaker 3:          02:21:02       Speaking of soccer and your mma stuff, I'm triggered by, and you're going to be interest Konan Konan Mcgregor, connor, connor, connor, connor. What happened? I'm going to get a thousand. He, I was trying to be impressive. Wait for the [inaudible] being nice to me. They're not going to be made, but it's going to be all whatever colon man, conor, conor Mcgregor, conor Mcgregor, I'm triggered by him. Triggered because, oh, he's a friend of the nemesis of my top man. He's a friend of Ronaldo. Oh, the soccer players channel. Rinaldo apparently is their buddy buddy, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi had been trust that you now know who he is. I also know that he's a tax cheat. Motherfuckers going to jail isn't, ain't no, he's not going to jail. No. I think Jamie says he's going to, the pokey says is going to get banked. So Dude's going to bang them. There is. Wow. By the way, I will gentleman's in great shape. I will ask you to look at it. Can you put it up again? I'm going to show you in 1985 pictures of me with more defined. I will show you photos. Egos, so showcase. How dare you. Godfather. It doesn't matter. By the way, you live in the present right now. You've got a one pass. Gloria, you had a barrel. Let it go. The six pack is gone. You we get it back

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       though. That's what we should do. The Dad sad six pack project. Yeah, and you sort of fill me as I go through the transformation. I'm not going to do it. You're going to do it on your own. I'm busy, Bro. How dare you. I'm reaching out. Infection. This is how you treat me. I'm going to get you a copy of the book. I'm gonna get you a copy of the primal blueprint. Yeah, I can't. I can't hold your hand, man. If you're a grown man, you're older than me. He called me son. Remember you're, you're not 50 yet. Oh yeah. No, 49 just turned. Oh yeah, that's right. Happy Birthday. The slide is real. I'm 51 so I'm already, I'm on the downside. So when it makes it even more difficult to lose weight, you're more set in your ways. Your hormone system starts Sulu and does your metabolism slowing down?

Speaker 4:          02:23:08       We've got to ramp it up, buddy. I do. You got to start off your day with exercise too. So are you, are you currently at the same weight as you would have been 20 years ago or no, I'm heavier but more muscle because I've been lifting weights with the last, when I got into Jujitsu like really heavily, which was about 2000 right around the year 2000 I started training in 96 but I got really into it around 2000 so over the last 16 plus years I've been lifting way more weights, like are really good in the lifting weights because I realized how significant it is a factor and also to protect your joints. That's a big factor too. Just the, the ability to uh, defend yourself better. You know, I, I do a lot of long endurance, you know, an hour cardio, but I've always been terrible a lot of ways.

Speaker 4:          02:23:56       How often do you do self tape? I've been here for a month in California, so 30 days. I probably did have 24 days. Wow. Yeah. That's amazing. Yeah. What do you do afterwards? Just so I'll usually do, uh, an hour, either treadmill or bike or a combination, sometimes elliptical. So these three are usually, what time do you do it? Do you do in the morning and going, oh, that's good. In the morning, but not very early. Maybe say. And you do an hour. I do an hour. That's a lot, man. That's really good. It's cause I was coming on your show. Uh, but uh, I usually do about an hour and now here in California I've tried to incorporate weight training usually back home. I don't as I understand that I need to do it more so. Well I would say that weight training definitely makes your body burn more calories, that's for sure.

Speaker 4:          02:24:39       And two for two reasons. One, because when you put on more muscle, your body has more requirements for for calories, so it's easier for your body to burn more fuel if you have more muscle. The act of lifting weights is very strenuous, burns a lot of calories and a it also, it's just, it's just really good for your endocrine system when you start lifting weights, especially if you do things like deadlifts or squats. I can't do any of that stuff cause I have three herniated disks in my back. You do, so I'll try with your back. What's going not actually about 2005 we were moving from one house to another. I've got a huge library books and I'm going to say this will become evident in a second. As you know, book boxes are deceptive and that they look like

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       they're small volume but they are extremely heavy. I went to pick one up and I did the wrong emotion. I felt my back and then after that it would just flare up maybe once a year and about four years ago I went down to bend down and then I was basically immobilized for what part of your back? It's the left side through your lower back. Back there. Three herniated this. So I went to see a physiatrist and here's his advice. Never bend again. Well those people are dipshits. There's so many doctors. It'll tell you don't do this and don't do that. I went to a doctor in 2002 because I had a torn meniscus, just a torn meniscus, really simple injury for someone as a martial artist and uh, they told me to stop doing martial arts. They literally told me, you're going to be a cripple if you start.

Speaker 3:          02:26:08       You don't stop doing martial arts. I'm like, yeah, okay. What the fuck? Kind of stupid advices that I'm like, just scope this God damn thing and let me get outta here. Right. I got back on [inaudible] and glucosamine. I ate a lot of fish oil and I've had no problem with that knee since then. Like they scoped out a chunk of Meniscus, which is really common with people that have extreme athletic pursuits, whether it's soccer, soccer, La guys are cheering, you know, martial arts. It's a big, it's, it's normal thing that they do. But to have this asshole tell me to stop doing martial arts, I'm going to be cripple. I've just, I just wanted to just say, look, you're a fucking asshole. Like you really have no, no qualifications to be saying this. Like this is foolish. You're fixed injuries. You can't tell me that if I don't listen to your stupid lazy advice.

Speaker 3:          02:26:56       It's just such a dumb thing to say to people be, especially when you're talking about a meniscus injury, you're not talking about a severe spinal injury where someone could become paralyzed if they continue the same thing that they're doing. Now you're talking about a meniscus tear, right? It's really simple. Not only that, they have artificial meniscus now, now they do stem cells that actually regenerate meniscus. By the way, stem cell research is another one that those forbidden knowledge, uh, topics because of, well it was way more now because they found so many different methods of acquiring stem cells. But yeah, but during the Bush administration, I was hugely problematic and that's one of the reasons why Europe got so far ahead of America. It's true. And there's a lot of, uh, people that go to get certain treatments. They got, they, they had to go to other countries.

Speaker 3:          02:27:39       Fortunately now there's a lot of stem cell doctors and specialists that are in United States that are having incredible success with injuries. And a lot of mixed martial artists do it right. Um, Demetrius mighty mouse Johnson is the best pound for pound fighter in the world. Just had some stem cells shot into his knee. Um, so it's, this is a really common thing that you're, you, you deal with some doctors who aren't athletes, don't work with athletes and then they tell you things like, don't ever lift something again. That is crazy. That is a crazy piece of conceivable. 100%. Yes. I'm going to show you a machine. When we get off today, we'll, I'll show you in a couple of minutes because we're gonna end soon where there's a machine that I have in the back called the reverse hyper and it was created by this guy. I've talked about this so many times, people like not again, but it's created by this guy named Louie Simmons.

Speaker 3:          02:28:24       And Louie Simmons is this guy who runs this very famous powerlifting gym called Westside Barbell. And he had a bulging disc himself and his doctors are telling them they're going to have to fuse your disc and you know you're going to have to have an operation. He was like, what? And he couldn't, as a person who is an expert in physiology and a person who is an expert in a, in exercise and, and teaching people how to get strong, he couldn't understand why if an injury, a compression of the disc, cause the disc to herniate, why couldn't a decompression of the disk cause it to reset or to heal? So he developed this machine that does exactly that. It's called the reverse hyper. And I have one of these in the back. So you see when he's lifting the weights up, it's strengthening the back. When the weights go down, it's actually pulling the back apart.

Speaker 3:          02:29:11       It's slowly decompressing the back in an active form. But has there been, have there been any studies that show that if you use this, your herniated disc he himself has done, I mean no peer reviewed studies, but athletes have used this time and time again along with decompression. Spinal decompression is also really important. Spinal decompression meaning like hanging from your ankles, hanging from your waist. I have a couple of different devices in the back that I can show you that allow you to relax your back and yoga is also critical. Yoga is huge because there's a bunch of positions in yoga where you are actively decompressing your back. There's one where you reach back, you grab yourself behind the heels, you straighten your legs out and you literally are pulling with your arms and you feel your back all like pop, pop, pop. You're releasing tension and pressure and you're actively stretching your back.

Speaker 3:          02:30:03       So I'm walking out of here invigorated by our chat and filled with hope and optimism about diet, exercise size. You know, me, nothing my friend. But I, it's, it's really important for people to work on their core and their spine and there's so many people that don't. I have a friend of mine was just big, strong, powerful guy and uh, you know, he played football and he's done a bunch of different things but he's never done any like real significant core work. And I started showing him some different exercises like windmills and things along those lines and he was stunned at how weak his lower back is because so many people don't work those muscles. And those muscles are critical for athletic performance, for your ability to move and to protect your spine from injury. There's a lot of injuries that you can avoid by just being strong in your core and your column, your spinal column and d developing strength around the, you know, that whole really super sensitive and delicate area of your back.

Speaker 3:          02:30:57       But decompression is real. Um, there's a bunch of machines that doctors have, and when I hurt my neck, uh, one of the things that I did is went to this doctor that would, they would have this machine. It kind of straps you in. It just gives you this gentle poles and it's sort of like, what about the upside down world? I have the one of those two. Yeah, those are good. Those are good. Those are good. But you have to learn how to really relax your back. A lot of people, when they hang by their angles, they tend to up and it sort of defeats the purpose, right? You have to learn it, you have to learn it. And it feels weird. Like you could feel yourself pulling apart, right? But you have to relax that. You have to allow that to happen and you have to do it really consistently.

Speaker 3:          02:31:32       It has to be something you do all the time. It can't be something you do like once every now and again, like, oh, I'm stretching my back out because it's going to go right back. And also posture is significant. It's a really important part of [inaudible]. Good. Yeah. I mean, that's why these chairs that we're sitting in, we're sitting in these, um, Ergo depot chairs and these chairs are designed to make you sit at a good posture. So if you sit like this, you'll sit with your spine in a, in a good position, normal chairs. A lot of times you're back gets rounded and you sit into them and he'd sink and then you developed this pain like right around your mid back or maybe perhaps your lower back depending on the, you know, whatever ailments you've got these chairs, I sit in these fucking things for hours.

Speaker 3:          02:32:13       I don't have any problem. And I think they're actually in some way beneficial because they force a good posture that actually, it's actually like a static exercise. They think about the standing a working desk. It's better than sitting sometimes, you know? Right. But I think, um, these things are great. Like, because these things force your spinal column to be in this correct position. But I think the standing ones, a lot of people have a lot of success with that. They also, a lot of people have success with those exercise balls. You ever sit on one of those exercise balls, they force you to kind of exercise. Like as you're sitting there, you, you have to kind of be adjust in a posture. Yeah. There's also a lot of those standing desks, they develop these a standing surfaces that are, there are a surface that's very varied.

Speaker 3:          02:32:54       So instead of standing on this absolute flat static, um, sort of a floor while you're in the same position all the time, instead, it's this dynamic surface where it has all these humps to it and you move around on it lot like, so you'll, you'll like lean on the left leg, you'll lean on the right leg if you're seeing those things. See if you can find one of those. Those, uh, surface is standing surfaces, uh, for a standing chairs. It's really interesting. I had a complete rupture, my achilles tendon when I was a soccer player. And one of the things that I had to do in 14 months of Rehab is to stand on one of those boards with a ball. And you had to because just to relearn how to move in and to adjust. It's not, you have to have a repaired surgically.

Speaker 3:          02:33:36       That's a big one. Right. That was, that was finished after that. I have one of those, um, in my knee, I have a, an Achilles tendon from a cadaver in my knee. Yeah. I want to, when you get acl surgery, instead of replacing your acl with a cadaver acl, which is significantly weaker, they take this, the acl tendon or, and replace it with Achilles, which is way bigger and way stronger and it makes your Achilles' tent where it makes your acl rather 150% stronger than a, a regular one. She goes, I don't know if you're aware of how it works with cadavers, but when they replace a ligament, what it does is essentially a acts as a scaffolding and your body [inaudible] this cadaver ligament around your own cells.

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       So instead of it being normal size, it becomes this fat cord that really keeps your, cause. I've had both my knees blowout to acl reconstructions. One in each knee. No, that's not it. There's other ones. That's just the chair. This guy's on. It's a standing desk surface, uh, standing surface, pull up, standing surface for, uh, for standing desk or surface for standing desk. Standing desk surface for standing on. Hmm. I don't know. Uh, I bet ergo depot has it. Well, there's a bunch of those, um, different kinds of standing desks, but moving surface for standing desk. I don't know. Just don't show me this way. You're going to go fucking crazy. But um, I don't know. I don't even know if it's good. I just saw that someone developed. So when I had my, a ruptured Achilles tendon, I'm the trip. Have you ever heard somebody describe what happens?

Speaker 4:          02:35:13       You actually feel as if somebody hits you with a sledgehammer on your Achilles tendon. When it pops, it feels like you were hit and you, I mean, you drop, like somebody shot you after the fact. So I had the surgery. This was, I was a student, a graduate student at the time at Cornell. I went back to Montreal to have the surgery. When I, when I went back to Cornell, I asked my fellow soccer players what happened, who was the guy who tackled me, uh, that had hit me. And then somebody, nobody hits you. You just dropped by herself. And then I had done, you know, I found out that that's what everybody feels like an explosion. It's an explosion. But the way your body feels it, it's as if there was an impact. Someone just clobbered the back of my leg. Nobody was around.

Speaker 4:          02:35:58       I just dropped. That totally makes sense. It's amazing how fragile we are. It's incredible. People are so, it was like the human body that's similar. That's one of them. That's a, that's a standing board. This one is a surface is a surface you stand on and it's just an uneven surface that has many different layers to it and many different, um, so now it's Sunday at either whatever, there's a bunch of them I'm sure. But you know, there's all these different solutions that people try to come up with for the real problem, which is not sitting in the proper posture at a, at a chair. And I sit in this desk doing these podcasts for like yesterday I did nine hours. Wow. Yeah. And when I'm doing that, I'm just sitting like this and my back doesn't hurt it. She didn't feel that your mental acuity is as strong going into podcast number three as it was in number one or yeah, it's only nine hours.

Speaker 4:          02:36:47       It's not that big a deal as long as you're eating food. And I asked this is because, you know, earlier in my teaching career, I could do back to back lectures, each one being three hours and it was no problem. Now I can't do it, not because of mental acuity problems, but because when I send me back back starts hurting by about hour for, I can't do it. Well let's wrap this up and I'm gonna, I'm gonna show you all this stuff, equipment, because you should really invest in this stuff. So it'll make a big difference in your, your, the health of your back. Because it's one thing we really didn't, they just don't, they don't look into enough. And the only time they look into it is when they're already injured. Right. And, uh, I really wish people would pay way more attention. And I wish I had known this before I got injured.

Speaker 4:          02:37:29       I got injured from martial arts because just the nature of Jujitsu and wrestling. There's a lot of people that I get in. I know a lot of guys that have had disc replacements and all sorts of fusions and stuff and it's just the brutal nature of, of the sport. But, um, the, I think some of that at least can be prevented with proper maintenance and proper spine health. Okay. Decompression stretching. I look forward to do yoga at all. I don't, you should do it. I, you know, I do stretching, but I do it in exactly the way that you said I shouldn't, which is very sporadic and yeah, don't do that. He got, it's kind of a daily thing, man. It's gotta be one of those things like brushing your teeth, right? You write down, you do it, you get it out of the way.

Speaker 4:          02:38:09       Just force yourself. To me, there's certain things that I just can't go through a week without doing, you know? And I don't allow myself because I know that there's just, it's easy to just fuck off and not do it right. It's easy to just be lazy, but when you do that, you, you do your body a disservice. You quick final anecdote before we end, I know we have to end just to point to your incredible reach. So I'm, you know, I'm recognized on the street reasonably off. We usually, it's because of the visual. Beautiful. Beautiful, right? This is what happened about two weeks ago. I think I might've even tattooed you on twitter about it, but you're probably going to read it. I'm being served by a waiter slash bus boy at a place in, uh, Venice beach. And the gentleman comes up to me and says, excuse me, are you?

Speaker 4:          02:38:56       I said, yes. He goes, Oh, I recognized you by your voice because I listened to Joe Rogan's podcast. So this is the first time that I was recognized auditorily, not visually. That's a pretty astute listener. That's a guy who really listens to Joe Rogan. But I mean, I, I say that story simply to point to apparently how infinite you'll reaches. That's pretty crazy. Or I have a very unique, very sexy, and they definitely have that. You definitely have that. But I also think that guy is probably pretty exceptional in his ability to pick up voice has amazing. Yeah. Because your voice is, it's, uh, it's distinctive, but not so much. Right. Exactly. Yeah. Well, listen, man, it's always a pleasure having you and somewhat have an open invitation. Of course. Anytime you're in town, and I really do hope you wind up moving here. Thank you buddy. Fuck those winters up there, buddy. Love you, man. I love you too, brother. Thank you. All right folks. We'll be back at five o'clock and about 40 minutes with Josh apps. See? Yeah,

Speaker 6:          02:39:59       yeah.
