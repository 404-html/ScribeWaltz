Speaker 1:          00:00:00       In a centrifuge or they spin it in a centrifuge and extract the medium chain triglyceride oil. Pete Holmes, that's what we're talking about. Mct oils. This is what's funny. Everybody's been asking me why we've never done one another's podcasts because we have an absurd amount of things in common. I'll give you an example. I was watching some starlet like in the writer's room the other day, starlit I started. I don't remember her. Never have used that word. I'm from the 30th. I don't know that I was just flipping a nickel under a streetlamp before the kid may have a toothpick in your mouth, but we were watching some startling on letterman and he was just one of those great letterman clips, so it was really just being a dick. That stuff you don't really see anymore and I loved it, but he was making fun of the star lit because she ate clay and all I was doing was googling edible cla.

Speaker 1:          00:00:44       Like I'm that guy. I'm a believer. You know what I mean? Like I'm one of those guys that fucks up medical studies, you know what I mean? Like they give me the pussy and I'm like, that works. That was amazing. My vision was sharp for four hours. You know, what is eating clay do for you? You know? See, that's the thing is if she had letterman was giving her all this shit and she couldn't do it, but I could defend it. I was like, if you ate poison and you went to a regular western medical doctor that give you charcoal activated charcoal is the same idea. These earthy type of things draw out heavy metals and poisons from your body. That's not to say that I'm going to go and eat a clay, but every morning in my smoothie there's a shit ton of, uh, w we can swear, right?

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       Yeah. Shit. Ton of Alaris wondered if we could switch a professional comedian and youtube too much television fellow. God Damn the man, the television man. Well fuck balls go a shit ton. I'm swearing about how much Cilantro I put in my smoothies because Elantra Parsley, these do the same type of thing. Doesn't garlic, didn't know Rhonda Patrick? Talk about that. But regardless, having some sort of an effect of pulling heavy metals or attaches itself to heavy metals, was it her might have been so many believers. So you're putting activate or whatever it is. Well, all is is healthy fats. Totally. This is super simple. Good for your brain. It's a medium chain triglyceride oil, so it's the healthiest aspects of coconut oil. It's good. Just get some healthy fats in. Yeah. Are you. Do you do coconut oil as well? Yeah, I'm a big fan of coconut oil and those forks over knives guys.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       Have you seen them lately knowing that they're off oil, they look like they're about to blow away. They're dying in front of our faces. They're so hardcore now. I liked that movie, but those guys didn't see that one. I don't think it's about the China study. The China study has been debunked. Did you know that thing? Who tried to scientists getting the entire Breitbart news staff know the China Study Alternative facts? Unfortunately they didn't. They. They used some studies. They use confirmation bias. These some studies that correlate all the time. One hundred percent legit scientists. Even vegans, scientists who have debunked it. Oh really? Yeah. I've looked at it and said, well, here's the issue. They didn't bring up this. They didn't bring up. That couldn't have been perfect. It was just a bunch of Chinese, Jamie and pull something up on it because there's. There's been some pretty good scientific analysis of it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       Analysis. CCS does that word hypothesis's that sounds like a wrong word. Analysis is. It's like the plural of thesis theses, which sounds too much like feces. It's one of those things you never say no. Can we go rest in peace? China study. Chris Kresser did. I don't know who that is. He's brilliant because. Yeah, you spent on my podcast for two and he was a macrobiotic. I make fun of Chris Kessler and you know, I'm just doing a general but he gets fucked with online, but one of the reasons why he gets fucked with his, because he was a hardcore Vegan and he was having some pretty significant health issues and then slowly but surely switched over. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. He. Well, it's one of those things like some people can eat that Vegan Diet and love great and be fine and healthy. It makes me feel I'm a.

Speaker 1:          00:03:58       I'm a flagging. What's that? Fish occasionally eat fish. Fish is great. I occasionally get drunk and eat roscoe's chicken and waffles. The thing is I don't want to be militant or stringent about anything. It's just like kind of another thing that we have in common is consciousness and all that sort of stuff and I don't like being rigid about meditating. I don't like being rigid about any sort of practice, including veganism. So like I tweeted a or I instagrammed a photo of me at shake shack. I made a meme that said two drinks, not Vegan and I look so happy. I'm like, I look like this. I look like a meal and the feet of like a double shack burger. It was unbelievable. Double murder. I, you know, it's really funny because I mocked vegans all the time. I had this whole bit about vegans in my act, but you will catch me at a Vegan restaurant at least four days a week.

Speaker 1:          00:04:47       But you know what you're doing. I don't know if Aaron Rodgers is a, not a friend of mine, but a pal of mine, all those nfl guys, you know this. I'm not going to tell you anything you don't know about athletes. They're all eating plant based and meat, like they eat clean protein and they plan. I just do the plants. I don't like the murder and I don't like the way it makes me feel. Frankly. I like putting things in my body that are readily absorbed and I said this on my podcast. I wonder what you think about this. I say you can eat a steak for protein. I'm very curious what you're gonna say about that because I bet you're going to school me. I say you can't eat a steak for protein. It's kind of like drinking coke for water. It's in there, but you have to do a lot of digesting and grinding and extracting to get it as opposed to something that you might blend and get into your cells more readily.

Speaker 1:          00:05:30       Well, when you blend food for sure, it gets in your cells more readily so you could blend the steak. Yeah, you can see that, but I mean if you blend like vegetables, it's much easier for your body to process like a smoothie. Like God damn, I drank these Kale smoothies and they go through me like rocket. And you mean it gives you the shits or. Well, not really. The shits. It's not. The shits doesn't get me die unless you drink too much mct oil. That's something I should bring up because it has come up. If you take too much mct is it

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       ultra lubes you up inside? And your body's like, well that a huge cargo loads they've been holding onto just your childhood. Like one of those, uh, logging boats tips over very fast river. Well that's what I see. I liked that you brought that up is I eat Vegan to get high. That's what I'm doing to get high. Like if you eat three live, like blue, green algae, that's going to ask you about that. That's really, really important. If you do have vegan food and that's something that Chris Kresser brings up, 12. Super important, you know, it's just, it's very difficult to get with strict superintendent for, to be in the dirt on the dirt. It used to. We'd get it that way and now I take it gets you high. You can you take that? There's this product. I should have brought you something called the High Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:06:43       Like, like, just feel good. Just like clean, like just like a river. Like you're moving. Do you think that has to do with like your placebo effect idea to that? Like I'm doing good. I'm eating healthy. Okay. That I could not shake shack burger but I've done it the other way. I was not a Vegan for 35, 36 years. So I have the data both ways. Well it sounds like you're doing it smart. If you're using e three live and every once in awhile you'll be like, Jesus Christ, I need some fucking Sushi. I eat Sushi, mi or would you be willing to eat eggs from a chicken that you knew lived in? Like a yard? Like something that's like healthy where you know there's no suffering. I can dig that and I just want to beefs I have with Peta is that they have this campaign against eggs with Peter Peter with not.

Speaker 2:          00:07:28       Well I do and I don't. I like Peter has actually retweeted my stuff a bunch of times because I'm really, really against dolphin captivity and really against Orca captivity and I say I think it's slavery that we tolerate in 2017. I really do. I don't think it's anything other than that. I think those things are arguably as intelligent as people. They just can't communicate the way we can and they don't have hands that committed pilate objects and create art. We have a hand. I have a bit about this. Why do we. It's not about dolphins, but it's like, why do we eat pigs, but we don't eat dogs and I'm like hooves. The evil feet. That's true. Dog with hooves. Now picture everyone applauding because I dropped kicked that monster onto a lit grill demon. A cloven hooves. That doesn't need its own chewing cud. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:08:16       What if you saw a pig with pause point and if you saw a dolphin with hands or checking the Khatak no fucking way. Well, chickens are dinosaurs. Chickens are fucking ruthless little monster. So say that. Oh yeah. I fed my chickens mice before. I have 23 chickens. You do not? Yes, I do. I love it. I get all my. I ate five eggs this morning from my chickens. Shit. Yeah, they're like pets though. Like I go out in the yard. They're like pets to give me food. Any attachment to them. Do you like your chicken? Yeah, my chickens died and my favorite one got killed by a coyote. That was awful. Coyote running ran over the phone. I saw it jump over that chicken chicken. It's mouth. Joe Rogan is after God, man. Then I found that the coyote was a mother coyote that had babies nearby and I felt bad.

Speaker 2:          00:08:58       I was going to kill her. Oh, I was going to set it up. I was going to leave some food behind and sniper from the roof though. Well, I just felt like she's just doing what she's going to do. I'll tell you something funny, I met with one of the women that like founded cafe gratitude, obviously Vegan restaurant, the Vegan restaurant that's deeply under fire. You know the whole story behind them, right? I don't. Oh my God. What's that? They. They started eating meat again. Who did cafe gratitude. The people own it really on a ranch and they started eating meat again and they started talking about it and they received death threats and people were protesting and boycotting the restaurant. Yeah. And they were terrified that they were terrified. See, this is why you got to be a fleeting as long as you don't stand anywhere to pescatarian.

Speaker 2:          00:09:44       Segun. Segun? Yeah. Because pescatarian means you eat dairy because I don't fuck with daring. Pescatarian means dairy. Yeah. Pescatarian. I thought pescatarian. Just fish. It's vegetarian. Vegetarian. That means that she's Vegan. So fish, seagate and seagate. None of these are catchy. You have to just say league and which means you can't touch me, but she told me when I met with her as a nutritionalist, and again I, I might be wrong. Nutritional list is not a worldly isn't word nutritionist. Yes. Nutritionalist, I don't think. Let's make it up. All kinds of words. Last night. I need some help. Can you help me out? Give me some over smoking dope. Brandon goes from right here. I actually, I'm on for right now. Jesus. Four. I love four before take the liquid or do you do the adults? Here you go fill out a box. Gives you a box.

Speaker 2:          00:10:32       Will. I'll take. I'll take what it did. Oh, thank you so much. I'm awesome. Cynthia, the box was sent to you. Oh really? Yeah, it's awesome. Please. I swear it tastes good too. I'm sorry. So go ahead Kathy. But gratitude, she was like, look, if you're not gonna do it if you're a Vegan. But she was like the perfect thing to do as an e three in the morning and one egg. She was like, you should eat one egg every day and this was good for you. Clearly there's stuff going on. Amino acid wise and cholesterol. Cholesterol is important. People you. Did you see the study that came out? Um, that was, uh, in the New York Times. It was not a study rather. But because I want to make fun of, no, it wasn't expos in the New York Times about how the sugar industry paid off scientists in 19 fifties to demonize saturated fats and take the blame off of sugar and for like a really absurdly low amount of money, like $50,000. We were saying, not even, I'll kill you money. Yeah, exactly. For $50,000, these guys essentially changed the way with this bogus study changed the way people think about sugar. Which sugar sugar should be goddamn terrifying. I know it's horrible for you. Did you watch a food choices is a good one. Then there's fat up. There's that sugar film, that sugar film. There's a of really good dance where you're just like, oh shit. I had Gary Tobbs in two weeks ago. He's the author of the case against sugar. Kevin Tubbs. No different guy.

Speaker 2:          00:12:03       He's a. If I think of a joke, I'm going to science journalist and he wrote a great book called the case against sugar, but apparently he's controversial too. It's a bunch of people are mad at him, mad at everybody. These are big lobbyists. This is going after like cocaine. It's not that it was. Other scientists disagree with him. Other nutritionalist nutritionists. You make them nice to you. I'm sorry you put words in my brain and smoked dope. Of course I did. Why wouldn't I? It's Sunday or something. I'm not sure what there was. No, actually yesterday or the day off. I didn't. Um, but. Well I should have got high. Watch the super bowl. Yeah. I walked away from the superbowl before the end. I'm like, this thing's done. Patriots won in the most record over time. Whenever. What do you mean? Four to 28. It was down.

Speaker 2:          00:12:53       They were down 28 to three in the third quarter. Holy Shit. Yeah. Tom Brady, they say he's the goat the greatest of all time. Oh, okay. I didn't know that. You don't know that? I didn't know. Not a sports fan. I met Tom Brady. Did you give a shit? I'm friends with Aaron Rodgers. You didn't feel weird and random. My Dad has always texting me a painter towel, trying to get insider info. How's Aron feeling today? I got five grand on. I fucking give a shit that I had an HBO special or have a show coming out is just like, how's your day? Tell me what happened is the wants to wait a little cash. So let's go back to cafe gratitude. So this cafe gratitude people. They decided somewhere along the line what was really weird because they connected it to Jesus. It was, um, they, they had this statement that they made their jesusy they don't do cheeses, but they'll do Jesus while they're older.

Speaker 2:          00:13:46       You know, I feel in Anita left for that. You know, they don't do cheeses, but they'll do Jesus. I'm not going to give you a laugh. I don't understand that. It's A. Oh, he must've not heard. That's a Tony Hinchcliffe style on human beings. Don't like jokes that computers would get it. Granted, no, I liked them. I just. That was, I don't know. It didn't get me. I understand. You're like, man, it is what it is. I might have laughed. I like that you're honest there. Jesus was going to say is I think this happens to a lot of people to get older. They start thinking that it benefits them to have some sort of potential deity in the future. You know what I mean? Yeah. I think they think of the future and they think of heaven and they think of Jesus and God and all these, get the numbers on that.

Speaker 2:          00:14:30       Like the conversion of people that become like serious Catholics when they're 70 might not even be Catholic. They might go to an alternative sort of church or you know, like just some sort of a worship place. Cc the door and you'd like a friend on the other side. Right. Well, I, I think gratitude is incredibly important and I think like a appreciation is incredibly important and one of the things that helps people feel gratitude and appreciation is a sense that there's something out there bigger than you and you sort of submit to that. And I think when people get older and their health starts slowly deteriorating and it's inevitable, you know, I mean as much as I'm 49 and as much as I exercise and try to take care of myself, I definitely feel like it's harder. It's harder to maintain a certain level of fitness and health.

Speaker 2:          00:15:16       It isn't as you get older. Yeah, and it can have an excuse. I'm just soft to you. Can you have an excuse? You're Vegan. Tough. It's tougher. Oh, come on. You've had some of those super fit. Vegans. Rich Roll. Yeah. You had them on. Yeah, for sure. That it fit his very fit. Different kind of fitness, just running for long periods of time. It's not really no explosion. No one's trying to kick your ass. Yeah, there's a lot millions, but my point is that I think that folks as they get older and they feel their their health slipping and they feel there's a lot of people that they really upped their workload as they get older. Like I talked to Bobcat goldthwait about that and Henry rollins is the same way. He's like, he feels like death at the door and he feels like he's got to be more productive.

Speaker 2:          00:16:01       We've got to get things done before he goes. That's funny. It could go the other way for sure. You could go more of a Buddhist threatened be like death is coming. Why was I so lost in this game? Yes. The toasted. Every time I drink a green juice, I've said this on my own podcast. I like to toast it and go, it won't save. You know what I mean? But it was something beautiful. And a lot of people, when they're nearing death, a Rom Dass has a great quote where he's like, most people do the most profound spiritual work of their lives in the last five minutes they're on earth because they get it. You're surrounded by everybody stuck and lost in the drama of this is important. And Joe Rogan, he called me an asshole on twitter or whatever it is and where there were suffocating, you know, and then they're free.

Speaker 2:          00:16:41       People that just go, like, it was just a game. It was a dance, it was a play. It's a dance. It's an experience. That doesn't mean we can't play it. I think like creative people for some reason feel towards the end that maybe they haven't done their best work yet. Um, and it's funny that this book is just sitting here randomly, but this book, the war of art is a title. Have you ever read it? No. Please take it. I've got a bunch of. I'm going to leave here to the runner up on double dare. Steven Pressfield's book. Good. Jamie, take the. That signed. One of them is signed, signed. Leave it. I got one for sign. Okay. Leave that one. Yeah, I'll get you one step of art. Um, I bought stacks of them and I give them to people and press go on the podcast. That's where this one is signed, but it's all about resistance and about how it's very difficult for people sometimes to just get things done because they put things off and they procrastinate and they. There's this weird thing that artists do wear a lot of times they half ass stuff and it's almost like the, the, the pressure of creating something, of expressing yourself, of doing something that you really feel proud of really good. It just, it's overwhelming to a lot of people and

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       I think for creative folks as they get older, sometimes they, they feel like there's no time left. Yeah, it's time to get going. Liz Gilbert, in her book, big magic talks about how it's almost like there's a collective unconscious getting the tank gentle and there's the ideas and we're almost like fishermen for ideas and something that I find motivating. Like I'm trying to write a book, I'm trying to do all these things and I'm like, I got to reel in that fish before someone else that's quieter. More tuned into that. Unconscious is gonna is gonna get to it first. You know what I'm saying? There's like an urgency. That's interesting because in an idea and then like five years later someone else has something very similar and I an idea or a concept similar kind of missed out. Honestly, that's not something I dwell on that much, but I do see it.

Speaker 3:          00:18:37       The other thing you made me think of is Tarantino before he wrote pulp fiction was like, I can't die. He's like, I just. I had a fearlessness where he's like, he was on like a bumpy plane and he was like, I'm not going to die. I haven't finished pulp fiction, and then he joked when he finished both fiction, it was like shit. Now he became very, very nervous that he had kind of like fulfilled his destiny. Wow. That's, that's ego mania. Gun. Why don't you think there is something. Do you ever get in manic states when you're writing or creating where you're just kind of like burning clean white energy? You're just like, oh my God, this is just kind of coming through me? Yeah. Well at the moment I start realizing it at the moment it goes away. Isn't that a lesson? You know what I was gonna say to you that I bet you would like.

Speaker 3:          00:19:24       I remember being very little and just being so much more interested than my other little friends. At what happens when you close your eyes and when you're. When you're laying down at night. I feel like a lot of people aren't doing a lot of people that I asked about it aren't doing the kind of work of like, what are you seeing? What does it look like? Mckenna Terence Mckenna talks about our dreams are probably far more interesting than we ever even realize you're remembered and if you're closing your eyes as you're falling asleep and you're paying attention, if you see something amazing. Like I remember one time I was feeling like I was on the bottom of a rocket and I just saw the exhausted, this amazing rocket taking me to outer space and it was perfect. It was pristine and as soon as I tried to hold onto it, it goes away just like that.

Speaker 3:          00:20:06       Yeah. That happens to a lot of people when they experienced lucid dreams. Yeah. Yeah. When you experience lucid dreams, like you're, you're awake, awake in the dream and then you realize it, but apparently it's amazing that I haven't done anything to try to cultivate this, but apparently it can be cultivated and there's a lot of people out there who do experience lucid dreams and can manage that dream. Yoga, I'm a big lucid dreamers. Are you? In fact, it's one of the reasons I saw a video where you talked about Alpha brand helping with lucid dream ticket late at night. I always have these fucking trippy dreams. Like last night I took Alpha brain before worked out. Um, so it was a few hours before I went to sleep, but I still, I still had some really bizarre dreams as it's making its way through my. It's wasted time. I think there is a parallel to be drawn.

Speaker 3:          00:20:50       We were talking about the drama of life. When you have a lucid dream, I think there's something very in the Ballpark of enlightenment going on. It's almost like a play version of enlightenment. Enlightenment. Why enlightened? Because I'll have a dream that I'm back in high school. The classic dream and there's the test and it's a, it's a nightmare. Scared, right? I'm scared and it's always like some history of math class and I'm going around this very realistic. I'm in my high school. The, the geography is correct. The people are correct and it's so realistic that I'm not just panicking. I'm actually, the dream is long enough that I'm asking people to borrow their notes so I can cram and then there's a lot of techniques you can do to cultivate lucid dreaming. One of them I do all the time as I look at my hands.

Speaker 3:          00:21:32       Anytime in waking life, if something surreal happens, you look at your hands because if you look at your hands in a dream, they always look wrong. It's a, it's a giveaway that you're dreaming. So I'll do something probably look in your dream. They look inflated. They look like those sports fingers. You know what Mickey Mouse hands. It's ridiculous. For some reason your subconscious can create a beautiful, you know, NASA rocket taking off, but your hands it can't do really turns out. You don't know the back of your hand that. Well. And then this thing right here is actually kind of trippy because this is what clocks look like in dreams because it's left brain, right? We're talking about this, uh, who makes out again, what does team one made it to the next youtube clock? What is the name of the studio? I just thought it was wrong clock.

Speaker 3:          00:22:13       No, no. This guy is amazing. He does it all by hands and he by his hands, he does it all by hand. Everything including the walnut case, tg tgt studio, tgt studios. You order them. He does a car, cuts the walnut, and he uses those things inside of them. Come from Russia. They're very difficult to get. What are they called? Nick's. Nick's youtube. What is the next to you right there? If you had the whole answer. Um, but, but when you're in the tubes, any clock will look like that. Oh really? Because it's the wrong side of your brain. What do you mean? Any clock will look like. That guy looks amazing. I might mix these up. It'll look wrong. It'll be like, it'll be 17:00, it'll be 17, the symbol for infinity. And then ideally. So the clocks will be fucked up too because the left side of your brain, I might get these left, right?

Speaker 3:          00:23:02       Confused. But the left side of your brain is what streaming. And the right side of your brain is what controls language and writing are so. So another clue is if you pick up a newspaper and notes and it just looks like Jibberish, that's a that you're dreaming. So whichever technique it is, I'm having that horrible, very real, very important. High school nightmare. And then you remember that you're dreaming and you're still there, but you're liberated, liberated, silly. There's no test. That's, that's a little taste of enlightenment I think as you go, oh my God, I was lost. I was in that dream so hard. And then you went, there is no test. And then you fly to Milan and you have sex with Kate Upton. You know what I mean? Like you realize upton, she's beautiful model. I don't remember her. Oh, she's the one

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       with the really big breasts. Got kind of heavy. You got to kind of heavy and people were mad. It's just took a strange left turn for Kate Upton. Right? She was also, um, yeah, that's her. Yeah. You know what's funny, like whenever I'm in my podcast form on my website, whenever people would be bored with the subject, they will start putting up pictures of Kate Upton. It became a meme or a theme. She came to a show. I did a show with jed and. And you met Leslie Mann. Nervous. Look right at her and go, oh my God. Yeah. I just heard the door. Yeah. So birds are amazing that through no nothing. She did just just random genetic luck. She has become like, I don't know what your voice sounds like. I don't know a damn thing about her, but she's pretty much perfect. Yeah, she's very pretty.

Speaker 2:          00:24:38       Some people think she's fat. Why Do, if she gained weight, I probably would just like her more. Really? Because you feel like she's human. Soft, soft. I like to like the world to be safe. Speaking of Tarantino, there's a great line in pulp fiction where it goes. It's a shame that the things that are pleasing to the touch aren't pleasing to the eye. Like you're a hard man. I bet it's more fun to hug me. No offense. Please don't. Don't let. It just depends on what you're into. Yeah, but you look way better than I do, so that's. Thank you for how you look. You should feel like me. It should be like I'm a tempurpedic mattress. I don't like. Those are not hard to sleep on a slab. Harder bed. I understand. Yeah. I sleep on a pretty dense bed. That's so funny. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:25:21       You're. Your sleep number is. Well, when I sleep because I don't know what it is, man, but whenever I sleep on a really soft bed, get like a crick in my neck or my back. Felt like a sink in too much or something. I understand. I'm, I don't have a tempurpedic. I am the tempurpedic. Well, you can get tempurpedic beds that are more dense I think. I think they did come and various density. They do. There's a from one. So anyway. Anyway, she's a tempurpedic bed like beanbag. I call them thicker, thicker milkshakes. I like thicker, thicker milkshakes too. But women. Oh, I understand. My milkshake brings all the boys. Are you attracted to women that are as fit as you? Um, I like women to take care of their body because I think that they have more of a body awareness. I think they're sexier.

Speaker 2:          00:26:08       That's interesting. Oh, so you draw an intellectual comparison. You Go, you have abs, therefore you know the science. They have abs. I think people who move their body a lot, like people who do yoga, people do gymnastics or martial arts or something like that. I think they're more aware of their body because they're communicating with in an intense way. You really. Yoga. Yeah. If you do yoga like all the time, you're communicating with your body in a super intense way on a regular basis and I think you'll just be less awkward, more confident or more sensual. I. I completely agree. Yeah, and it helps. Yoga helps you breathe. I remember when I did a lot of yoga, the guy was like, you'll notice that yogis always brief. They stay calmer because they know what it's like. It's another staffer. It's another death thing. It's like meditation.

Speaker 2:          00:26:54       You're asked to supposed to hurt when you're meditating because you're trying to extricate your consciousness from your body. You're supposed to hurt. Like when you're sitting down. What I'm saying is pain as part of it, of yoga or meditating and of Yoga. Yoga, you could say their pain. There's pain and yoga and I'm over here. That's the only reason why I disagree with you. My best meditation by far is in a sensory deprivation tank, which not only another thing. We haven't gotten no pain. It feels amazing. Yeah, I wouldn't call that. Do you meditate? Do you?

Speaker 2:          00:27:28       Yeah. Well I breathe. My meditation is all concentrating on the breath deep in through the nose and out through the mouth. I take these really long breaths where I'll breathe in for like almost a minute. Then I breathe out for almost a minute. So you're very difficult to do oxygenating your blood. Well, I don't know if it's that or if I'm. I'm controlling myself. I'm exercising my personal control because you want to just bring. You don't want to do it. Like when you take, try to take a long breath. Like I'm one minute breath in. It takes a lot of effort. Yeah, I'll for sure. And to hold it and then breathe out slowly. Well that's kind of my point is monks in the mountains or you in the tank or whatever it is. People doing yoga. There's something bad ass about it is because you're doing something that looks like.

Speaker 2:          00:28:17       When I was a kid, I just thought monks were relaxing. Oh, they just. They couldn't take the world. There are too many TV channels they went up into. Those dudes are tripping out and they're denying the pain of their body. Just exactly what you do when you push through a workout. I had a friend of mine, he became a monk. Really? Yeah. It was a regular dude. Dunkin. No different guy. I don't. I haven't communicated with them in a long time. I'm sure he's not a, I don't know. I mean he might be just completely off the grid now because he dove in hardcore. I was probably like 17, 18 years old and he was a guy that he used to train with and my taekwondo school, his name was Joe. Joe Smith, last name. Don't make us trying to remember his last name. Anyway, he's a nice guy, but an interesting guy, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:29:02       He was just like cool black dude. And he started meditating because he would get real nervous before sparring. Oh Wow. Inspiring me. And I'm real nervous, so he started to figure out a way to maximize his physical ability and potential and he figured controlling his mind would be the best way. So he got involved in meditation and then he sought out lessons at this Buddhist temple and he started meditating there and he got super serious and then he quit his fucking job and moved out of his apartment and lived in the temple and just cleaned up for his food and he became a vegetarian, very strict vegetarian. He would eat just vegetables and rice, that's all lost a shit ton of weight and essentially stopped training

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       altogether. Stop fighting and competing and doing anything like that and just would meditate and giving up your life to gain it. That's like a Jesus thing and you know, like a Zen Koan, like the sound of one hand clapping, like you meditate on that because there's no answer to that. And he had a really weird one. It was a really weird one. Something about a dog barking is how do you know your Buddha nature through the sound of a cricket and and you're just supposed to be like, ah, I've, well the crackhead is may and I'm the cricket and they're just like taken stare in the corner. Let's see. That's pain too. There's all this like we know in our life that suffering leads to growth and it leads to like a cleansing. Sure. I had all these things and I think these turned on guys figure out that they can manufacture a type of suffering instead of waiting for it from the world, which is going to come.

Speaker 1:          00:30:29       Inevitably. You can go and sit on a hard ass floor or you can restrict your diet or you can breathe in for a fucking minute. You're causing suffering because you know on the other side of it, that's where blesses. That's where wisdom is. All these good things. It's also the understanding that a lot of your desperate need to breathe. It's just your brain fucking with you and you're gonna be fine. If you take this denial of the body, like when I've been free diving and there's a beautiful thing when you're low and you're like, shit, you panic, and my friend who was teaching me, he was like, he calls it second breath where if you relax, you realize it's your brain fucking with you. It's your brain is like a woody allen character and he's just like, well, we better get up right now. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:31:13       I need you to go shut up woodrow and you realize you had way more oxygen and you relaxed and that that's. I feel like it gets this reputation as being kind of like a soft or maybe even like a feminine kind of meditation. Yoga not so much now, but it certainly. My father doesn't think it's cool. It has definitely a feminine reputation or weak reputation, which is insane because it's one of the most difficult things I do. I lift weights, I do martial arts and do all these different things and I swear to God, Yoga is as difficult if not more difficult than all of them. Yeah, for sure. And I'll say you'd probably wait, I mean you look like you're way a good amount. Yeah, around 200 pounds. Somewhere on there. I wouldn't want to throw you. So if you're using 200 pounds and you're, that's your resistance, it's going to be difficult.

Speaker 1:          00:31:58       Throw me. What do you mean? I, you know, I think I would hurt my back if I were trying to try to heat the martial arts stuff is the ball pit or something. I'm seeing like a friendly scenario where you go please keep me like a dwarf. Oh, do you want to throw me how you got from Yoga? Throwing people away enough that I wouldn't want to throw. You look at someone and go, I like to troll you. You feel like have a small fella. This is what folks do is we look around and go, who in in an order from one to 10. Who in this room would I tossed first? Who could I throw the furthest? I would throw Jamie first, but for me like there's, there's moments in yoga class where I swear I'm tested as much as anything ever in my

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       life right now where you're holding a pose and it's, you know, you can keep holding it, but you know, you want to stop and you're, you're whole body is shaking and you literally see the sweat pouring off your face and falling off your body. Especially hot yoga. Yeah. Yoga hot yoga class. Oh. Literally mean if I do cool yoga, I'm still the guy with the. I got to put out the special towels and stuff. Yeah, it looks like a dog, but I've seen people do yoga on like hardwood, shiny floors and you know, like in or start sweating. They're slipping all over the place. That just doesn't seem smart. No, that's dumb. That's very, very dumb. Yeah. It doesn't get, it doesn't get the respect it deserves, but I think that, uh, you know, it's also, there's so many douchebags involved in it. That's part of the problem.

Speaker 2:          00:33:28       Let's go. Guys ruined everything. They do body sprays. I'd like to wear a Bluetooth earpiece. It sometimes I gave up on them, I gave up on them when I saw how gross it looks from people. It's interesting because you could be having a meeting on a phone rather a conversation as long as there's a cord that goes into your ear. Yeah. I would be like, oh, he's just having a conversation on the phone. That's cool. But if you're standing there talking and you're moving your hands around, you got an earpiece and I'm like, Douche bag. Yeah. Yeah. And if you leave it on blinking during dinner, you are a Douche. Do they still? Uh, I, some of them, these two blue blue, right. Which bluetooths the guy. He's got the airpods your buds buds that are wireless. They checked out Gary Vee. He was here the other day.

Speaker 2:          00:34:16       Gary Vaynerchuk just keep a. He loves him. I wonder if when the cordless phone came out, anybody who was like, hey, that's douchey. Oh, for sure. What do you need? You don't need a court bro. You fucking cool. Oh, somebody has a bit of that. I wish I could remember where it's like the first person that used none Barela. They were like, oh, you're too good to go with. So I got an umbrella. Like the latest technology was an umbrella. I'm sure. I wish people, people are always looking to be upset at cars that don't make any noise. Oh, you're going to look at your car and you focus. You're going to hit a cat. Oh, what are you using the solar power instead of dead dinosaurs. The dinosaurs aren't good enough for you. Although fossil fuel wasn't really dead dinosaurs, just FYI. It isn't mostly plants really plant based Diet.

Speaker 2:          00:34:58       Well, it's um, things rotten, you know, but there's a, there was a book called black gold stranglehold that I read. It was so confusing because I was like, I want to say like at least 15 years ago. But the books, the premise of the book was that what we've been hoodwinked and that the idea that oil is a finite resource, it's not true, but it's actually a natural process of the earth itself. Like, it'll keep making it a repeating process in that wells that have been dry have rebounded when left alone. Really? I don't know if it's true though. That would never looked into it again. Maybe I live. We looked at, maybe we talked about it once during the show, but we were probably high

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       scatterbrained. I had a great experience in a float tank the other day. I've done it maybe four. Have you ever been your. You have one, don't you? Basement. That's awesome. That's pretty cool. I went to a place called just float and the first one, the one in Pasadena. Yeah. That's huge. It's the biggest place in the world. The Best Company for him. The biggest. They have more float tanks I think than anyone in the world. Well, it's amazing because they're doing the first one that I was like, oh, this is like a spa. Like I've been to the one in Venice at some guy in flip flops, like my boy crash. No Way. Yeah, he's kind of built my tank. He's the best. Yeah. Well the float lab. I couldn't get over the fact that he was gonna come get me. Oh, he's the best night to worry about.

Speaker 1:          00:36:12       Crashing in the tank was like, how long have I been in here? Whose name is a sound effect is going to knock on the door and it's gonna scare the shit out of me. It totally ruined it at just float. Maybe crash does this now. It plays music at Lowe's. You out of it. A lot of guys like to do that. It's a good move and it's like a pizza oven. It's like a door in the wall and you crawl in and I had a pretty. I was trying to go like leave my body and he ever talk about astral projection. Well no, but I know what you mean. I was spending most of it being like it would be so trippy if I just went and visited my girlfriend right now I remember. I'm not saying I did it, but I definitely didn't do it, but I remember having this very clear thought where I was like, I've always wanted to try a sensory deprivation tank and I was in it.

Speaker 1:          00:36:59       So it was somewhere else completely unaware that I was in it and then I like jolted back into let's just say my awareness. I was lost in my mind so deep that I forgot where I was. I forgot who I was. Very relaxing. Yeah, it's amazing. And it's also something that the New England patriots use on a regular basis. How about that? I really believe the falcons want used it too. They put the goat in there. They use it for all their players. They use it for visualization. They usually for recovery, it's really great source of magnesium too. Because the EPSOM salts, it absorbs through your skin. Yeah. Do they change the water? Yes, they do. They do. And they also filter it out like the float lab as a really intense filtration system which uses ozone. They use these gigantic spa filters and ozone and like to the point where it killed everything that might be in that water except step to you except come except coming for sure beats off in the water.

Speaker 1:          00:37:51       So a friend that went in one and he was like, I had to pay. I just let it go when you want to spend an hour in your own piss and then as a whole, what does that, the gratuity. That's an asshole. That is a real asshole move. That's the thing that people are fucking terrified of those things. Hot tubs and swimming pools, but they're ruining the communal. It's like when I was in high school, we used to have this vat of Coleslaw that was free and I was such a hungry boy that I would love the Coleslaw. Then you find out that jocks are spitting in it like that. That's whole ruin everything. They ruin yoga. Yup. Yeah. Earpieces, Bluetooth, veganism. See that's why I don't want to

Speaker 2:          00:38:35       be a two associated with it. So, um, pull up the article and that, that restaurant in La, what was it called again? Cafe gratitude. Gratitude at the article came out in May of last year, so six, seven months ago they found out it came from a blog post that they had posted in 2015. So it had gone unnoticed for almost a year. Then they were getting a bunch of shit. Yeah. They made a blog post about what was their ranching and farming and that they started eating meat again. They felt healthier, the animals raising responsibly, but you know, to vegans the hardcore, at least it's still murder. You know, you're still killing these animals. You know, I'm a. are you a Joseph Campbell Felon? Yes. Love. I'm here to return to meet by cafe gratitude owners, spark Vegan uproar, uproar, you know, really, really scary shit because they were getting death threats, which is really.

Speaker 2:          00:39:27       Yeah, I mean, just doesn't seem. It doesn't seem right away, but you get a lot of that man. You get a lot of people like, look what's going on. Like, you know that UC Berkeley, I'm uh, the Milo Yiannopoulos protest that was going on a few days ago. I saw this guy, there was a girl out there. It was a trump supporter and she was uh, trying to, uh, I don't know if they were filming her or what, but you know, there's a lot of people out there that they show up to these things and they, like, they want to argue, they want to make videos and argue with people. Some guy hit her over the head with a wooden handle of a sign and she swung at the guy and another guy got in front of her amazed or in the face and there's a video of this and you're like, Whoa, you guys, you guys are the kind people that don't want this man.

Speaker 2:          00:40:20       Who you think is, you know, they keep calling him a Nazi. It's hilarious because he's a gay Jew. Milo Yiannopoulos was Jewish. Her doing it. Okay. So she's wearing a make America great again hat and some guy comes across. This is not the video that I saw. I saw it from a different angle, but they take her, she gets pepper sprayed. Are they showing it? They're not. They might. Oh, okay. That looks right there. She just gets pepper sprayed, like cc it towards the end. It's crazy. Somebody just pepper sprayed her just just because she's wearing that hat, which is what it is. Look, that's a fucking man. Just walks up to her and pepper sprays or in the face. It's crazy. The idea that you think you could do that just because you don't agree with that person. Thoughts. You can choose violence because you don't agree with that person's thoughts. Instead of having a civil debate, she's not. She's not as threatening. She was not physical. She's not doing anything violent. We're missing a mythic hero. You know? A lot of people want Bernie Sanders to be that guy, but we don't have a Martin Luther King that's telling us, listen, only love can drive out hate. Only light can draw darkness. So you ended up with a

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       lot of people that don't have a narrative or a story or a or something in common, and then you just have people kind of running it however they see fit and some people are stupid and they're going to pepper spray paint. Well, there's also this. Is this her getting, this is another angle of it, paid for it. So she's got this hat on in a free country. I mean it's fucking insane, man. That someone could just walk right up to her and pepper. Spray her in the face just because she's wearing a hat that supports Donald Trump. You know, if you want to talk to someone, you talk to them if you don't agree with them, have a conversation with them. But there's this narrative that's going around and it's punch Nazis, right? People keep saying that so. Well, who the fuck is a Nazi? Who Do you determine as a Nazi?

Speaker 4:          00:42:18       You decide they're a Nazi and then you punch them, right? Do you have evidence of this person's a Nazi? Do you. I mean, do you, do you see them? Do they have a Nazi flag on them? Are they saying Sieg Heil? Do they have a copy of mine comp? No, you just decide wearing the halloween costume. So here's how it goes. Here's the thought process is if you want it to fall like on a flow chart, it's like decide someone's a Nazi, then you can punch them, punch Nazis, find someone. Are they a Nazi? I say yes. Punch them, and so there's this. There's a bunch of people like respectable, intelligent people that are just plain upset that trump is the president. Just plain upset that in their eyes, and I think rightly so. There's a lot of assholes that support trump and there's a lot of assholes that are now gloating and they didn't know.

Speaker 4:          00:42:59       They're like, grow up, you lost. We won. There's all this going on, and their response to it is now those people are Nazis. Go Punch Nazis and these really impressionable people are out there. Punch them. Do you see jake shields, the former UFC fighters in mma fighter is a good friend of mine. He had to save some kid who was getting beaten up by a whole group of people just because he was a trump supporter. He didn't do anything. He was just there at this thing and there's a few people that were, you know, trump supporters or Milo yiannopoulos supporters and the rest of them were people that were mad that Milo was playing there. It's, it's so controversial and so fucked up and so wrong because the left is now becoming the right. Like you're becoming a fascist by saying it's like a one stop fast.

Speaker 4:          00:43:46       It's like a weird twists in the movie. Yeah, I, I love the. There's a kabir quote where he says, do what you have to do with another person but never put them out of your heart. And I think that's a great way to remember. I was with rammed us with Duncan in Hawaii and he said, I hate Donald Trump here, not here. He pointed to his head and it's not as hard. And then the thing that I love, and this has been a mantra for me for ever since I've heard it, so it's been about a year, but it's very applicable now, I think is that hate is a lack of imagination. So when you see somebody wearing a hat and then you make all these assumptions, but you're not taking the time to consider. Maybe this person was raised different from me. Maybe this person is scared of this, this or this. Maybe they had medical issues. You know what I'm saying? Is this great David Foster Wallace thing? Were you in that great

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       graduation speech he gave called? What is water? Have you heard that? No, it's amazing. But he talks about when you see an suv on the highway and you just assume that there's some like piece of shit changing lanes, fucking burning gas, taken up the world like a real kind of like a shorts and a grid out guy that's, that's a dick and taking more than he deserves it. He's like, that's a lack of imagination. If you consider that, maybe that's a mother who was in a terrible car accident that was all but prescribed to drive a big vehicle so she would feel safe. Again. That's what I'm talking about when you see someone wearing a hat and you just go, well that's a Nazi. I'm going to punch it. You're not taking the time to not just have empathy, but actually compassion and realize that we're all in this together.

Speaker 1:          00:45:14       I remember after after trump won in the green room of a comedy show that we. I did a show the next day and somebody was having like a full blown panic and rage and talking about how the terrorists, we're going to test him, like the terrorists are going to test them. They're going to, they're going to do this and this and really panicking and it really kind of gave me a little bit of perspective on it. I was like, if Hillary had won, we not us, but other people who are just like us would be somewhere else in some other comedy club and some other greenroom complaining about how the terrorists are going to test hillary. She's weak. She's a woman. They're going to test her and it just made me realize, shit, we're all in this together. That's what I mean. Beyond empathy into compassion. When I see someone in a red hat, I go, there's my brother and my sister, a different life, a different path, playing a different part, but we're, we're all part of one body and pepper.

Speaker 1:          00:46:03       Spraying that body. You're just spraying yourself. I understand rage and and protests. You know what I'm saying? I don't agree with trump. Here's the thing, but violence. We're hurting ourselves. I think you're right about a lack of creativity or a lack of imagination and being able to look at that person and say, well, how did that person get to that point and what went wrong in their life and why are they here? Where the, you know, are, uh, you know, whatever it is, whether a pepper spraying somebody or protesting against something or you, whenever you have a cause and you have two sides, people are going to jump on one side or the other. It's just natural. People want to be in a tribe. They want to be on a team. And when you set up the narrative and it really dangerous narrative that people on the other side of fools, people in there to sutter evil people in the other side of the you, you set up these two camps and these two completely different sides and it becomes a black white issue, but it becomes a red state blue state issue. And this is what you're seeing here. You're seeing fights. These are tribal because it is us. As soon as we come and ask, they become with them what or had isn't even a trump hat. It says may make bitcoin great again. It's a big one hat. Oh Jesus Christ. What if I was suddenly so that guy pepper sprayed her and he thought it was a make America great again hat Jesus fucking Christ. Oh my God. It's just assholes. You know? And not only that, most of them are wearing face masks and they're covered in. There's

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       a mob mentality that is a very real. It's whatever condition, whatever it causes it in the human psyche. But something happens where there's this diffusion of responsibility when people act in large groups that allows people to do really heinous things and it's been studied, you know, there's been psychological studies drawn on it or done on it and it's really confusing. But you know that poll, everybody if you ever been in a riot type situation or in a group situation where there's a lot of people and something goes wrong. It's really weird. There's a weird feeling that happens when a large group of people. I was on the subway going downtown to the women's March and it was getting so packed that people were starting to panic. A kid threw up and stuff and I was going to shit. I forgot what it feels like to be with a lot of us when we start getting scared.

Speaker 4:          00:48:21       But that's the beginning of imagination. That's the beginning of coming up with some sort of game plan for compassion when we can sit down and have a discussion. I'm not saying don't make signs and don't raise your voice, but I am definitely saying, don't pepper spray somebody that's in this world with you. That's like trying to figure it out the best they can. You know? I mean, this don't make sense. Don't raise your voice. It's always a good thing to discuss things. Right? But what's wrong with these discussions with the Milo Yiannopoulos thing is they're trying to stop him from speaking. If you want to get your point across schedule, debate, he'd be more than happy to debate you and do it in a respectful manner where you can try to pick apart his points. I've had milo on my podcast, I've picked apart his points, I've had him on and we've gone back and forth on the important shit like religion and circumcision and this.

Speaker 4:          00:49:15       You can have a conversation with the guy and what he's doing is he is getting a fuck ton of attention through the streisand effect. When you try to silence him by pulling him out of these, these things just for speaking and he's not doing anything wrong. He's just speaking. The university has allowed him to be there and then people are going crazy to do $100,000 worth of damage to the, to the university, and then the fucking mayor of San Francisco congratulates people for speaking their mind. He congratulates people for expressing themselves like, no, that was a fucking riot man. Like do you understand what happened? 100,000 dollars worth of damage and people getting beat up and a girl getting pepper sprayed for wearing a bitcoin hat. That's not good man. I know you want to be progressive and I know you want to be liberal and I know you want to be the mayor of the most progressive place, but this is all the wrong message. The correct message is calm dialogue. People discussing things will keep calm and remain calm and carry on. So this guy, Milo, when you're fucking screaming and yelling, he wins. When you stop him from doing that, I think he sells more books. You're also making a bigger point, I think, which is when we become us and we let them become them and we lose of the fact

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       that we are all part of one body. I mean when we shine it superorganism yeah. Talk about wanting to belong to a clan. We do. We belong to a very special group. It's a trip that you're here, that you are here at the same time. I'm here and we're here talking. That's beautiful. That's what I like. Hippie. I thought you've taken lsd one time. Sticking together. I'm already on it. I wish I were. I'd be. I'd be going off even deeper, but I'm just saying when you take psychedelics, you do get that glimpse into your like, you know when you give. So if I give you a gift, if you give me this book, it's really just the right hand giving something to the lefthand. It's all one thing so it doesn't work to fight against ourselves and it's not good to call somebody them and to be divided.

Speaker 4:          00:51:17       Well, it's also, there's no communication going on when you're screaming and lighting things on fire and breaking windows at starbucks that's not communicating. You know, you're expressing your anger that this guy who says that feminism is cancer, talk to them. Try to figure out why he's saying that we have a debate with them. If you disagree with them, find out what he's saying that's not valid and have a counterpoint to it and that's how people get to share ideas, express themselves, and then the people watching get to look at it and go, well, he had a point, but then his points better and then you figure it out and that's the marketplace of ideas and that's how human beings communicate. And as soon as you stop that, as soon as you stop free speech, you fuck the whole God damn thing up because now you have decided that you're a fascist and you're saying that your ideas are more important than other people's.

Speaker 3:          00:52:02       Don't you do a good devil's advocate person, but don't you worry that some of the people that are making more base kind of dismissive generalizations like feminism is bad and Muslims are bad, right? Aren't necessarily listening to an intelligent dialogue, so therefore isn't there sort of like a cause and effect of like, this is some crazy shit. We're going to do some crazy shit. Some

Speaker 4:          00:52:26       of them listen to Doris writing pepper spray and some of them aren't listening, but I think you always have to appeal to the higher side of human consciousness and you always have to express yourself in the most articulate way that you are capable of, so you should try your best to get your thoughts across and it's not always easy. It's oftentimes very difficult, especially when emotions are involved, especially when you think this causes very important, but I think it's critical because you're doing something in a very public way, right? Because this is something that people are going to talk about for months and months. There'll be talking about the UC Berkeley riots for a long time. It's very critical. I think whenever you're dealing with something that is going to get massive exposure like that to do your very best to communicate your thoughts without all this extra bullshit attached to them and anger and screaming and yelling, don't get lost and don't get lost in it and and figure out a way to vocalize, to articulate the the, the reason why you feel a certain way and what you have thought about it.

Speaker 4:          00:53:27       Not, not, not some knee jerk bullshit that's easy to dismiss. You know, Muslims are bad, this is bad and that's bad and feminism is for full composed w not that way. Now to express why you think Milo's wrong. Express why you think he's right and that's the marketplace of ideas and you might disagree with that person that you're talking to, but you've got to let them talk. You got to let them talk and then you got to figure out a way to counter what they're saying. I, again, not a good devil's advocate. I think people worry when we let these people talk and I went to it. When you say these people though, Milo is not something to worry about, he's not a guy who advocates violence. He's a really interesting guy to talk to. He's kind of a troll. I mean what he's doing is fucking with people and it's really accurate and it's really what he's doing is being very effective and he's.

Speaker 4:          00:54:13       He's getting people to buy his books. He's getting people to come to his lectures is getting people. When he got banned from twitter, that was probably the best thing that could've ever happened to him. He did like a hundred interviews afterwards. It was on CNN. Even cnn they're doing like CNN supposed to be news, right? So He. They have a photo of him. Ridiculous photos were in a fur coat with sunglasses on because it's so silly and it says Milo Yiannopoulos is trying to go to colleges to convince them that hate speech is cool. Like how the fuck is that an article on CNN. How is CNN saying that? Because that's not what he's saying. He's not saying that hate speech is cool. Look at that right there. Miley Annapolis is trying to convince colleges that hate speech is cool. How the fuck is that? The News?

Speaker 4:          00:54:56       It's not the news that is heavily editorialized that it. That's a ridiculous. You're taking a stance on his opinion that he would rabidly disagree with and it's not right and this is. This is left versus right. It's like CNN is the new Fox News. CNN is the sky's falling and the world is shared and we're fucked, and Fox News is now all of a sudden the grass is green and everything's rosy and we're making America great again with bizarre. It's interesting because you're trying to zoom out and I think that's one of the things that's very integral to kind of getting through a time like this is zooming out and going, yeah, look, looking at what's happening in a big way. We're becoming what we don't want to become. We're becoming militant. We're becoming violent, we're becoming fearful, and I would. I wish there were more opportunities to have, I guess these, these dialogues that could be done peaceably well.

Speaker 4:          00:55:48       I think there's an issue also in that people do not feel like Donald Trump represents what they think of as a leader in their mind and a lot of people's mind and in my mind, Barack Obama was an amazing leader and people will get mad and pissed at you, especially conservatives. We will. What are you prone to? Listen, that guy was smart. He was articulate. He was calm and measured. Any always seemed like he wanted what was best for the country. Whether you agree or disagree with this policy. He and my mind was very statesmen like I agree the way he would say when you're

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       in, when you're playing a part, the president. I'm not saying the president is a puppet, but I'm saying part of it is the mythological role. I am the president and that's why people talk about acting presidential because how much of it is that? How much of it is the way you handle yourself and the way that you treat other people and the way that you tweet or the way that the apprentice sucking? Yeah, sad period. It's. It's a strange. It just. Even the vocabulary, I see a lot of the trolls using some of the same. Yeah. They're saying don't do that too. They say sad at the end of the surgery on Joe Rogan's podcast, sewing up behind president. You know, funny. Anyway, said Cook, how did this. What's it like to be a cook? Well, it happened because that's what one. That is the response. We tried one way we didn't like it and now we're trying the other way.

Speaker 1:          00:57:10       It is. It's a classic example of what human beings do. Yeah, we don't. Well, that's zoomed out. I like that. Well, I don't think that the idea of a president is the smartest idea to run a group of 350 million people that are trying to integrate and communicate with the other 7 billion people in the world. Democracy isn't the best form of government. It's just the safest. It's good to quote, safest. We have A. Patriarchy would be far more. This is what they were like. If you had a benevolent ruler, like a really big good one, that would be more effective, but it's too risky to do that. Way Too risky. It's just contrary to human nature and absolute power corrupts absolutely. That's a wavy gravy is easy. Great. He was as kind as he is. I think he's still alive. This like weird hippie guy that kind of like the comedian of the time we did all the psychedelic koolaid acid trip bus thing.

Speaker 1:          00:58:03       He had a funny joke where he was like, he wanted to nominate nobody for president. It was like we should vote for nobody because nobody can do it, but it had all these funny slogans were it was like nobody can solve our economic prowess problems. Nobody cares about you. Like all these funny thing. It was like, and more people vote for nobody than any other candidate combined. We got to get nobody in the office. Do you see what Neil degrasse Tyson posted? He said there should be an option for none of the above. Then if none of the above winds, we start the process all over again. Why? Why? I think a lot of people would have done that. I think that's a great idea because to make this artificial limitation like, okay, these are the people. It isn't able to grasp, so I shouldn't be surprised how many people would have lined up and gotten all around every way.

Speaker 1:          00:58:45       They wouldn't have been live. Tried to vote to have been like, I'm voting that we need to go. We need to go back to one for, for president. All the other things. You get to vote for it and then for president vote none of the above. I bet it would have been like 70 percent of the country. I would have been. It would have been. Would it have been something crazy? You would have done it just for the novelty of it been like I was the first one to vote. None of the above. Everybody wouldn't. You wouldn't been the first would know what? I think it would have been most of the country because I think that even if you were opposed to trump, there's very few people who thought that Hillary was the ideal candidate for. She was incredibly flawed. She had deep, deep ties to financial institutions. She wouldn't release the transcripts from and people get so mad

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       when you talk about these things. You're the reason why trump won, bro. You're a big part of it, man. You kept harping all the problems that Hillary has said. You're not supposed to ignore what's real and true and obvious about a person. If the other person has flaws as well, that's not how it works. That's just, that's how you box yourself in and put blinders on. That's not lifting up and looking at it objectively right above there. The reality is it's an insane job to put one person in power of all these people. I think there should be a large group of people. It should probably be chosen by a large group of people. I think that voting should be far easier than it is. I think registering to vote should be far easier than it is. It should be something as simple as you have a social security number, punching your social security number.

Speaker 4:          01:00:04       Oh, it shows here you're over 18. Yes, you can vote. It should be that simple. Are you not a felon? You're not a felon. Okay, great. You can vote to vote online. Have a light buzz on. Shouldn't there be like maybe some sort of a, just a, just a very light test to determine what your understanding is of these bills, what your understanding is about the impact of these things, what your understanding is about what this entails. I always think it's the immigrants that understand that stuff because they had to go through a very rigorous process and then you asked me what the bill of rights is and I'm like, oh, Bob care. When I was a kid I used to deliver newspapers. When I say a kid, I was driving, you know when I was 16 and 18 and when I was delivering newspapers, there was this guy named a non, a non and a n a n d, this Indian gentleman who used to work, he was a pharmaceutical expert in his country, but when he came to America, he, his degree didn't translate over here and so he's becoming an American citizen, so he would always.

Speaker 4:          01:01:13       He was. He was a hilarious little dude. He used to swear all the time. I weighed about 100 pounds and he'd be like, I could easily throw them. Yeah, you could throw him like a beach ball. He's like, you don't know shit. Nobody knows fucking shit. Nobody knows shit in this fucking country. What'd you do in this fucking country? Who come here and then you'll go home and go to sleep. You don't fucking know shit about your fucking laws because he was trying to read all this stuff because he had to become a citizen so you to take all these tasks and so he was a. He would ask me questions, do you know you know what the 13th amendment is? Do you know what the 14th amendment? It was like, and I believe I don't know any of these things, and he'd laugh and get the fuck out of here.

Speaker 4:          01:01:48       Go do your route. Which is a real friendly kids. Children. Exactly. You know what I mean? We don't know the value. We don't have to. We don't have to and people tend to do what they have to do. I think the way you become an immigrant in this country, we have to go through a comprehensive test and you have to understand the history of the United States. That test should probably be what you have to go through to vote. It's funny because I'm agreeing with you, but we're. What I'm agreeing with is we should simultaneously make it very, very easy social security number and very, very difficult. Very easy to be registered to vote, so it's not something go up. You missed the deadline. Fuck

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       you. Your vote doesn't count. How quiet would the line be to vote? Would all be studying like popped one random question and it was like Frederick Douglass, 20 minutes you'd have to do it online and if you did it online you'd be able to cheat. But even if you were ever to achieve, even if you were to what's more American than that, but mean be looking it up on Google. Right. But even then at least some of that data is going to get into your fucking head. Yeah, right. I mean that's gotta be better than the understanding that most people have. Whether it's historical or whether it's just a comprehensive understanding of how our electoral process. Because googling it doesn't stick. That was tom's. It does. I don't remember shit like I have to listen to things about three, four times before I finally, but don't you think it's because they don't have like an emotional connection to you?

Speaker 1:          01:03:06       Look, if I read it's really important. Yeah. Well I had a bit about. Well where I was like the time between not knowing and knowing is so brief. There's no feeling associated with knowing like you don't get adrenaline and adrenaline is linked. Linked to memory, like adrenaline is linked to memory. Oh yeah. This is right up your alley. If you're ever trying to memorize something. College kids listening, get to studying for a test, dip your arm and ice water every 30 minutes or whatever. It will become a traumatic experience. It will help you memorize. This is why we have a hard time for getting trauma, so it's a very light trauma. Oh, that's interesting. Or a trauma by just ice water, which is not that traumatic at all. Big Old tank and dunk here. They, they've done controlled studies and memorize. What a great idea.

Speaker 1:          01:03:48       Well, that seems to be like you could memorize things really good in a cryo tank if you did like crow genic. I've never done that. Have you? I do it all the time, dude. You fucking feel it. That's 250 degrees below zero. Is that unbearable? Yes. You do it for three minutes for some reason. Okay. Three minutes. For some reason I was like, they figured it out a way to make you cold, but you don't expect it. You know? You experienced the fucker. What about infrared Saunas? I did one this morning. Great. I don't fuck around with that. Joe Rogan is good for you. I spent messaging for a mixed blessing for memory, stress in the brain, brain connection. The limbic system includes the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, and these only one Jamie. He just throws it up on the board and the Amigdala and other important brain structures that govern emotional responses, behavior and longterm memory.

Speaker 1:          01:04:38       The release of adrenaline increases levels of activity of these areas of the brain has been associated with improved memory. Isn't it funny like the words that he googled our bold this we were living in the future. So amazing. But the bit I had was that Google's making A. I think it's one of the reasons I got to do a talk show after Conan and I did these two Conan's sets and I think I picked good material and the first one was about how google is like a calculator that helps you cheat at everything that's funny. So you don't know anything. And the example I give is there was a time like I've been in bed and I'm just like, where's Tom Petty from mean? I just look it

Speaker 3:          01:05:17       up. Running.

Speaker 5:          01:05:21       That was a real example,

Speaker 3:          01:05:22       but back in the day, if you didn't know where Tom Petty was strumming, you just go around and ask people lie jail bro. He was born in Asia.

Speaker 5:          01:05:30       Ah,

Speaker 3:          01:05:33       and they'd be like, holy his long hair. He looks like California, maybe California. Then one day you'd meet a girl and the heartbreakers tee shirt and she'd tell you Florida and endorphins and adrenaline and all this things would light up in your brain and you remember that moment for the rest of your life and that's how you met your wife. He's one of the few awesome things from Florida. There's like Leonard Skinner, Tom Petty, Billy Corbin, who was doing cocaine, cowboys, Disney world, but in la, what's better? Disney world is supposed to be bigger, right? I like Epcot because I'm 37 years over there and they eat babies. Remember that kid got snatched up. Fuck alligators. There's no at Disney land. I know there's cougars though. Chicks.

Speaker 5:          01:06:11       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:06:13       Lip Jobs. I will. I buy into Disney. I'm embarrassed. I want to be like, fuck this shit. This is. You have children know when you have children. Disneyland becomes a magical place. It already is, but it really is. If you have children, some children in the big golf ball in the big golf ball. What's up, bro? Oh, hap. But I was really young. I haven't been to Disney world. I went to, I did a corporate show at Disney world and it ended at like 10:00 and they'll keep one park open till midnight or something, maybe it's 11 and uh, I went up but you couldn't buy tickets until they stopped selling tickets at eight. So I went up to the gate and I'm talking to the girl that I'm trying to get into epcot and you know, they're, they're so trained to be good at customer service, so they're just like, I'm so sorry sir, you need a ticket and you can see the town.

Speaker 3:          01:07:00       They're from like, come on daisy. I know they'd raised you better in grand rapids. She's like, I'm so sorry. And people are walking by going like, Hey, great show. I'm like, and she was like, I'm so sorry. And I, and then they opened the gate for a woman with a stroller and you stuck it in and I just went like, I just put my hands up and I was like, daisy, I'm so sorry if, if anyone asks, I'm going to say that you tried to stop me, but I'm going in what she do. She was just like, please don't please. I was Kinda, I was kinda being a dick, but she was just like, please don't please don't. And I walked and you go over this bridge when you get in, and as soon as I got over the bridge I felt like a refugee.

Speaker 3:          01:07:39       Going back to Tom Petty, Holy Shit. One of the best nights of my life, my heart closed. We had some Saki. I was with this young lady that was organizing the event. We had soccer, soccer, soccer. I play soccer. I don't know if I've never heard anybody say soccer, but I think you're right. But we drank it and everything in epcot is unlocked so the park is closed. It's dark and we're waiting to get kicked out and we're opening every door going into rides that have been shut down. It was one of the more hands in the gears.

Speaker 5:          01:08:10       What makes this thing work? My finger was there, could turn it off. It was going that way. It cut my hand off right here.

Speaker 3:          01:08:17       Then I jumped fences and swam and every pool. I-Pass. No, you did. And it was one of the best nights of my life. You jumped fences. Once you broke one law, you're like, fuck it, I'm a rebel. You get a little sack and you. And then you get the feeling of entitlement that Disney provides. They make you feel so important. It's one of my theories, but I think rich people are assholes, is because have you ever stayed at like a four seasons or something? Then if you say at the four seasons and they love you and, and they're, hello, Mr Rogen, we noticed your room isn't quite ready. Here's a Mai Tai. You know what I mean? They just kiss your ass so hard. Then you go, I had this happen. I stayed at the four seasons in Hawaii and then the next week I was on the road and Portland and I was staying at a best western.

Speaker 3:          01:08:55       I was just like, this is why rich people are dicks. Because I was like, sorry, your room's not ready. And I was just like, could you call me? When they looked at me like I was insane. They were like, no, I'm not going to call you when it's ready to go get a fucking hundred grand bar and sit down. Nobody cares. Sandbar John Molina is the best bit he did snl. I tell the story like it's my own. I don't even give a shit. He was writing for Mick Jagger on snl and it really helped me understand why rich people and celebrities can be rude because he's watching mcjagger go like diet coke. You know what I mean? Not being an asshole, but also not being like, hey, how's it going? Joe? Could I please get a. can I get a diet coke please? That'll be so great.

Speaker 3:          01:09:34       I'm trying to write a new song. He just goes diet coke and Malania was like, I get it. You're not polite to Siri and when you're that famous, everyone is Siri checks. Mix, shuffle the rolling. So you know what I'm saying? Do you know what Siri is? Just because this is the way you know that you're talking to somebody. You know they're not Siri, but they become Siri. If you have five decades of everyone kissing, you need to do acid. If that's where you're at, you need to do mushrooms, you need to do something, you eat a cookie. I said many times my fantasy people have like weird fantasies about getting trump out of there. My fantasy is, is turning them on. Oh yeah. Get them on some dmt and let them bring them to the center of my universe. Texted me a fake photo.

Speaker 3:          01:10:19       It's trump with a beard and it's on Fox News and it says lsd saved my life. I was like, this is just a guy. I just want want them to take mushrooms. Spray. Oh Shit. Yeah. To Stop. I got it wrong. Actually recorded. I have it on my phone if you want to play it. I recorded this thing. I was listening to around us in the car. Do you want me to play a short clip of rammed us from? Do you want to hook it into. Well you could. Can you do it? Okay. It will be better that way because I recorded it just now in my car because I was like, no. I got one of them old iphones with as an auxiliary jack. I liked the Auxiliary Jack Cole annoyed. Why would they do that to Lightening Jack? Now you're assuming I can upgrade my car, my phone. There's an adapter that allows you to use an ox jack and the lightning and there's an adapter to make steve jobs rollover more efficiently in his grave

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       because of the whole idea is no adapters sticking out of your fucking phone like a second Dick. If you didn't have it, people wouldn't buy it. I like the option for an adapter. In fact, this phone started sucking ass. It's like crashing and shit and I was like, if I bought a new one, they are fucking. Yeah, they throw things in the mix. I believe that's a true conspiracy for sure. I think whenever you get a new iphone, when the new brother, a new iphones released magically, my old iphone starts hiccuping soon as that God damn I'm operating system gets updated. It's true. And they force you into it. Yes. You have to sync my phone to the computer and it was like, you got to update your software. I had been resisting you fucking bitch. I was like, fuck your ass. So anyway, I was listening around us and this was recorded in the eighties, maybe early nineties, and he talks about Donald trump and it's, it's pretty fun. It's only a minute long lit

Speaker 6:          01:12:03       hero figure within that mythic structure. It starts here that caught your attention to Donald Trump, for example. Now you may snicker and not want him as a mythic hero figure, but he is, he is a hero figure in this culture. And when I look at that, it's a little like, um, you know, in those tribes where they take a maiden and they honor for a year and then they boil her or throw her off a cliff or something like that. I mean, I'm not the Donald Trump myth, not Donald Trump. He's just a porsche slump that's caught in the. He's been selected to play out the myth and he gets the feeling of, wow, I'm Donald Trump. Enjoy baby. You can have it. I mean, Donald Trump, this is an obscenity because how much the person close their heart to keep so single minded on that while all around them are the have nots. And the people that are falling by the wayside just because of the way he is living.

Speaker 2:          01:13:08       That's kind of it. That's a weird argument just because of the way he is living because he is living in an opulent life. But if he wasn't living in an opulent life, the resources required to make him live an opulent life would only help a certain amount of people. There'd be a great number of people that would still be left in absolute poverty. This, I don't like that argument because I don't. I don't think that that's what's going on. I think there's a game going on. I think he is completely invested in the game and that game is acquiring money, acquiring wealth and fame, and he's really good at that. And that's his game. I mean, he doesn't really produce anything else, especially now that he's not the host of the apprentice anymore. Right. I mean, he's the executive producer. I mean without him doing that, arguably he's producing.

Speaker 2:          01:13:55       And I use this very loosely art because that's what it is. You're watching the program. What I like about what he's saying is he's just kind of stuck in the Donald Trump that somebody has to play that part, the villain. Right. But I don't think he's doing anything that's fucking anybody else. Like I can't really. I mean maybe he is. Maybe is business wise maybe is how many cars do you need? You know what I mean? Like when a holy man, when you find out a holy man has 15 Mercedes Benz, the guy who owns a bikram yoga, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. He owns like all these hate what happened with him. But we see these other guys playing these other roles going. Like of course he has five helicopters. He is, he's a billionaire. He do, you know, that guy's deal. It's really funny. He was being tried for tax evasion apparently.

Speaker 2:          01:14:39       And they, uh, they found all these. He had all these Ferrari's and bentleys and shit and he, his claim was that he was starting a school for children and how to repair automobiles. So that's why he got these cars. That's a good alternative facts right there. That's, that's almost beautiful. Such a unique case, that beacon guy, because they did an hbo real sports about him. I want to say it. Oh my God. You have to see that fucking insane. He's insane. I'm going to write that down. He was talking about these women that beat from Hud Noi, Noi. He changed his name to hot yoga, Bikram Yoga, last name, right. Um, he, um, he was addressing these allegations of sexual assault and he said, you know, that women will give $1,000,000 for one drop of my sperm. Oh yeah, that's what he was saying. They were like, no.

Speaker 2:          01:15:37       The woman who was interviewing me was like, what? Yeah. One drop of my sperm. $1,000,000. And that's like that. Like oil. We think maybe that does replenish. He could really make a lot of money. Imagine just a line of Petri dishes and him just grabbing his cock, like a bent garden hose and just dripping out little drops. One million, 1 million, 1 million pip, pip. About a billion dollars off my stomach. Really? How dare you. This is the guy that's responsible for this. It's really so it's so interesting because it's so. It kind of embodies what's bizarre about human beings because this guy's responsible for so many people's personal growth and enlightenment by him bringing yoga and hot yoga to the United States and making it so popular of being this force because perhaps because of his ego, because of his desire to achieve fame and fortune and all these different things that he has gotten, he's also spread this thing that's been amazingly beneficial to people, which has in turn fueled his self righteous indignation.

Speaker 2:          01:16:40       It's actually kind of goes back to the rioting. Aride is a bad thing. This guy being an asshole is a bad thing, but it's a bad thing. Almost hoping to do a good thing or maybe a bad thing that also does. Have you ever met somebody that's a real piece of shit, but they also do a lot of charity work and the charity work sort of masks the fact they're a piece of shit. Like that was one of the things about Sandusky. Send Dusky was this. One of the things about him is that he was molesting all boys that he was helping, so he ran this charity for boys and then he was fucking horrible, but it's something that people do. They run, they'll do something where they're doing something very charitable sorta to mask how shitty their our or to justify who they are and there is someone in this kind of fucked up scenario that did just benefit.

Speaker 2:          01:17:30       You know what I'm saying? There's someone who just benefited from that and no one evil. Yeah, underlined. It's one of the strange paradoxes of life. One of the weird things that we have to deal with, human beings are capable of so many weird rationalizations and this is going back to the diffusion of responsibility thing that happens in mob mentalities. You know, with all I've, I've, I've, I've felt it. I've seen it before where people are running around hitting people. And when I was a kid, I worked as a, um, a security guard at this place called great woods. You're a Massachusetts guy. Remember Matt Mansfield, mass, Great Woods Center for the. Yeah. I used to work with Bob Seger. Would put Bon Jovi I had been to, but I've been to great words. I think we see it. So, uh, Dan Fogelberg I saw, I saw Rodney dangerfield there. Sam kinison there.

Speaker 2:          01:18:18       I saw bill cosby there. I saw Bon Jovi. Big of a venue. Can you play before people start to go like Rodney, you, you do get a lot of respect. Like we all paid hundreds of dollars here. Clearly make respect. No respect at all. This was in the grill, barrel of cash behind my favorite Rodney days because Rodney used to go on stage naked with a bathrobe on. Wow. That's what he did towards the end he did. He decided that he was going to perform with a bathrobe on until he. And he has like a fuck you, you can't make just what I'm doing it. That's what he felt like doing. Liked it. Like that feeling I like and he's naked. He was naked. Was it? Could you see as Peccadillo you can be guys who were working backstage saws hog because he's like his bathrobe. So he didn't give me all the time.

Speaker 2:          01:19:04       You have no respect place. He's like, Hey, I put it on the sea of people who respect me. No, I just think he literally didn't give any fucks. Zero fucks left. He was deep into his sixties and he would go onstage with a bathroom. That's my dad. I've seen my dad's Dick more now than when I was a kid because he doesn't give a shit how my dad isn't deaf. He just doesn't listen. Like he literally don't care because he doesn't want to listen to him. I told my dad to get a hearing aid and he goes, what could you be saying? And then resumed watching jeopardy on 100. Isn't that what could you be saying in a row? But I'm sure he was in a row but it happened. But anyway, um, I was there and a riot brought out, broke out. I was working and I was in the um, yeah, great. Great Woods has a lawn for people don't know. It's an outside area. So part of it is under like a roof. And then there's this back lawn area and Neil young was playing and uh, you know, fucking stoners and burnouts were there for Neil young

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       and they started fires. They started like little these little campfires lighting papers on fire and we had to break it up. And uh, I had a Hoodie that I brought with me because I always knew I'd seen a lot of fights and I, there was a lot of altercations and I saw one of the security guards beat the shit out of this guy because he stole one of the golf course and they hit him over the head with a radio was like craziness. I saw craziness at that place and I was always like, this is not worth $10 an hour. Like it's a good job. Like to have when you're 19, 10 bucks an hour. I was like, wow, I got some good money. It was good, but it was legitimately physically dangerous. And I was working with a bunch of other black belts. It was all like martial arts guys that were working there as a security people.

Speaker 4:          01:20:51       And I was a at the back area where the fires were and we were told to go put the fires out and we're like, you know, there's radios were going off like when people are fires, we're going to break out. And they, they, they canceled the show, they stopped the show in the middle of the concert because of the fires. And then fights started breaking out and I put the Hoodie up, a zipped it, put it over my security outfit and walk right out the door. Fuck this, good for you. Because it had gotten to that weird place where like, um, I saw my friend Larry, who's like one of the most peaceful, friendly guys in the world, told this guy to put down, put down, put down a fire, you know, get the fuck away from here. And the guy goes, fuck you. And he punches the guy and punched him in the stomach and dropped them.

Speaker 4:          01:21:32       And as soon as the Larry Punch somebody so nice because I am gone. I'm so out of here. I just walked right the fuck out and quit. See in life we need a larry. Yeah, you need a canary in the coal mine that you go. If Larry's throwing blows, well, he was like the sweetest guy in the world. Get the fuck. I mean he was a trained killer, but he was like a super sweet guy. So if him, if he got to the point where he was so on edge that he punched this guy, I was like, there's no way I'm fucking. The guy might've called him a nigger or something like that. I think it was, there was so much chaos going on because he was black and the guy was white, but he, he blast this guy and I'm like, if Larry's Hinton people, this fucking show's over.

Speaker 4:          01:22:10       And then uh, you know, we heard something over the loud speaker, but the show stopping and people were going crazy. We can no longer rock in the free world. But there was this feeling. It was this feeling in the air of like terrible things can happen for sure. There was this feeling like, don't get trampled where people are screaming. No, not people anymore. It's not you and one person. So if it's like me and this other person, they'd be like, hey man, relax. So we don't have to start this fire. I'm going to get out of here. Joe. Have a good night. That day when I got home I ordered like two months worth of earthquake food and I was like, I don't like what we become when shit goes sideways. Well, we kind of. One of the things that studies have shown is that in natural disasters, people come together, they come together and support each other and help each other.

Speaker 4:          01:22:55       It's common, it's really true. But that the blackouts in New York, yes. It helps people help each other. It's really like some of the best aspects of human beings do come out. What scares me is not that what scares me is these unique moments where violence breaks out and there's groups of people. That's because I feel like there's a genetic memory that we have that's from war one on one hand to hand combat warfare because our ancestors for thousands of years fought like that. They fought in these chaotic battles where you didn't know who the enemy was. You're swinging an ax, right? That is so ingrained in our genetic memory that I think when these riot type situations break out, like when that guy sprayed that girl in the face or hit, they feel like that's the enemy. There's this instinct to just start swinging at people that are on another side.

Speaker 4:          01:23:42       It's in our bones. Yeah. I think it's a terrible thing to cultivate. It's a fairy and so in order like when when you, when you're establishing us versus them narratives, I think you. You set an incredibly dangerous precedent because I think you tap in ancient genetic memory. That's why I'm trying to say it's not us and them. I know it just sounds like hippie nonsense, but you're right. I put it is send us in the stake of the sixties was when the hippies were like, it's us and it's them. We need to get them when it. When really we always need to be remembering. It's all of us, which is why it's a real problem when you just want to. When you simply put a label on something, boom, he's in knots. I. Right. Well, these definitely not a Nazi Punch Nazis. Okay. What the fuck? First of all, he's not a Nazi.

Speaker 4:          01:24:25       You're wrong. And second of all, if he was a Nazi, how the fuck does someone become a Nazi? How does someone become now like we should probably figure out what makes a person like that? The idea that you just going to fix them by punching them. No, you're going to start a goddamn war. I'm trying to get. His name is Christian. I think I'm trying to get an x white supremacists to come on just for what you're saying. I think podcasting can be powerful and we need to have people that can offer perspectives that you know aren't great. Now I'd like to talk to somebody that's reformed in that way. Well, long form conversations do reveal certain aspects of people and you were starving for it. It's very difficult to tap into, you know, if you're doing seven minutes on a late night show like Conan or something like that and you see sometimes people do.

Speaker 4:          01:25:09       They sort of breach these controversial issues and he like, man, boy, you can't really do that service. That's right in the next 45 seconds. I also love it because sometimes the joke has a two hour setup. Yeah, those episodes, right? Holy Shit. It was like three tornadoes converging at the end and we didn't know you and I as stand ups or from a world where you have to get a laugh. They have 30, 40 seconds or whatever. I've had some of the funniest things ever happen. Two hours into a podcast and it wasn't even funny up until the end. Until the end. Yeah. Oh definitely, definitely. And also when you're two hours into it with another person, like you know, you and I haven't had long conversations before. So when we're having this long conversation, I get to sort of explore how you think about things and you look at things and you get to see how I do and we compare notes, we compare ideas and then, you know, my idea is get enriched your ideas, getting enriched. Exactly. Sort of come together and this, each other. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       for sure. And there again, it kinda goes back to my google thing. It's like boredom is good. How I had so many. I mapped out the whole worlds and ideas and moving ideas. He has a kid because I was bored as shit when I see the screens in the back of the head rest. So the SUV is now. I get it. I, I don't have kids and maybe that is something. You just have to be like shut the fuck up and watch. We there yet. Are we there yet? Are we there? What do you want to watch? Frozen but frozen on everybody. Cheers. It was calm. What is lost? There is something, some people do well with boredom. I went to a summer camp where there was nothing and that's when I started doing improv. Well one thing for those kinds of things you could put on educational programs for kids and they actually do enjoy looking for.

Speaker 1:          01:26:48       I put on nature shows for my kids all the time. They enjoy it, but you know, I think you have to engineer like when you say boredom engineer's certain amount of time in your life when you're free from all that stuff, put your phone away. Well, there's a jacket, what is the Japanese word for it? I'm forgetting, but it's a value that they have. The word means emptiness. Like time. It's not meditating, it's not contemplating. It's just all right. For this hour I'm just going to be open and see what happens. I think that's essential. We don't have that. It's we're jammed up, man. We're jammed up and even more oil, even more so jammed up when you have more obligations and you have a family and you have a job and you have careers and you know, you have a podcast and you're also stand up and you're also doing a television show with a fan because I just got engaged and we're thinking about having kids and stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:27:38       That's one of the reasons I want to be married. And uh, how do you find it managing because your business is you and your life and your thoughts and your ideas. I manage it, you know? Um, but it requires thought and work and effort and it takes away from some of the things that I would want to do more often. And you have to shorter, you know, Louis Ck. I had a great quote about being dad once I thought was really cool because I read it after I'd already sort of absorbed it and then he and I read him saying, I was like, oh, he's so right. Said, let it change you. Interesting. That's beautiful. It's a great way. Great way to describe it and not to resist. I think that because I know guys that do resist and they wind up getting divorced, they want to be in Shitty dads and they wind up being, you know, dad's divorce don't resist because my wife left me. That's what my hbo show is about. What your first wife left you for? Jumping right back in. Look at you. It was. That was 10 years too soon. Too soon. How old are you? I'm 37. I got married when I was 22. Oh yeah. Well that would work. I would.

Speaker 1:          01:28:40       I went to a Christian college, like a proper youth ministry. Major. Chris. Well, that's what the show is about, is about a religious guy whose wife leaves and then this is kind of what happened in my real life. I got kicked into the deep end of the comedy scene. So people like Tj Miller and Nick Kroll, John Malaney like rescued me when I didn't have anywhere to go. So on the show it's fictionalized version

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       of that. Every episode I'm crashing on the couch of a different comedian. Wow. So you were 22. You're hardcore Christian. You meet this Gal. She's hardcore Christian to. Oh shoot. How long were you married? I was married for six years. We dated for about a year and a half. This is a true story. I knew we were going to get married when she went down on me because I could because I was like, you don't do that with someone you're not going to marry. And it was I wrong with you. It was our engagement blow job. Wow. On bended knee. Hey, you were married and then what happened? How did it go? So that's what's interesting is, is talking about letting it change you. I remember before I had experienced any sort of suffering, I had a pretty charmed life and then I experienced some pretty severe pain and uh, and that's when I started to figure out who I was, what I cared about and what I actually thought was funny.

Speaker 3:          01:29:55       So it turned out this is very unlikely thing made me into a much better comedian. Plus I had way more free time. Oh, well for sure. It's gonna make you a better comedian if you could survive it. Like anything that's rough emotionally makes you a better comic if you survive. That's what already already laying is in the pilot and he's in a couple of the other episodes as well. He's amazing and he's like, it's good. You're, you're, my wife left me funny now. Used to just be like, kind of cute observational stuff. He's like, you're a man now. Shit happened. And he's like, true. I'm, I stabbed myself in the heart. Funny. It's like a different thing. Did he hit his heart? He's trying. He stabbed himself in the chest. I'm going to be at the heart. Seems to be doing better. I mean already.

Speaker 3:          01:30:35       Yeah, he's been on the podcast. He's amazing. Yeah, he's a good dude. I was like, call his next book, consummate professional because he showed up early. Nailed his lines, improvised, killed it. He's a huge part of why the show got so funny. Dude was very funny and he's a good guy. Like he's a good guy. He has this crazy moments and all that jazz. But. So anyway, he's got a good heart. Speaking of Sabic really does have a good. He does. He's a sweetie. So, um, so she leaves you. Yeah. And how she leave you will. She was fucking another Christian of her. Who's the other dude? Another teacher that she worked with found Rocco. This is all names. Rocco sounds like a bad play. She fucked a boxer named rocky and I actually, he wasn't, he wasn't a bad guy who used to like each, like we'd get along and stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:31:25       And then how long was he banging her for before you found out? Well, that's actually because we moved upstate. I was, there's a lot of elements to the story, but we moved upstate because she was a country mouse and I'm a city boy and then we were like, oh, let's just live in this episode of green acres. Let's just live in sleepy hollow, right behind the cemetery. It was so terrifying and I just felt this distance between us, but I thought it was because she'd get home at like 4:00 and I'd leave at like five, 6:00 to get into the city and time to do like five minutes at some shitty open. Mike. So how far away did you live in the city square and seeing each other? Sleepy hollow is only about 45 minutes maybe if you're trying to lived in sleepy hollow. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:32:05       Yeah. Is it the sleepy hollow where the story came from? Yeah, I believe that does a lot of sleepy hollow's right? That uh, that author I forget, is it or I forget who wrote it. I don't remember who, but I'm a dummy and I lived there. I believe he was buried behind my house and I lived on Gory Brook road chain was all these things that are happening that made it seem like a dream. I literally would lay on the bed because she's not there for me. She's having an affair. I don't know because I was just like, it was the last thing on my mind. Uh, and I thought I was dead. I thought I had died and gone to some sort of weird purgatory because you're in this new place and your small town and she's distant from you and you're by yourself up the steepest hill to come home from a fucking metro north.

Speaker 3:          01:32:53       It took an hour and a half round trip to do five minutes at UCB and I'd come home and she's asleep and I just like get drunk. I was so sad. I thought I thought I was dying. I thought, oh, I guess I'll tell you a story. One time when she was having the affair, I called her and she answered the phone. She was acting really, really weird and like looking back, the dude was clearly there. Who knows what they might've been mid boning, I don't know, and I was like, you're acting weird. And then we had a security question like you, you, like in Jason Bourne, you ask a question that they know the answer to and if they answer it wrong, you know, so I go up all the questions I go in, what city did we get married? So now not only is she whipped, the other guy, she's answering Trivia about our love boy, she answered it correctly and I hung up years, you know, when we broke up, she was like, I just don't know why I answered the phone that day, but I, I thought she was being burgled.

Speaker 3:          01:33:51       Oh right, right. I guess a burglary before. And that's how naive I was. Well, I mean you just consider it kind. I tried to maintain because on the show crashing, February 19th, hbo I on the shot and playing that guy. I'm trying and it's kind of Nice. I like going back to that time when I was, I like to think I'm still a sweet person, but people used to think I was on ecstasy. You're definitely a sweet person. Why would you think you're not? I don't know how you're a grownup now. I've lost my temper, but you got an edge now. I wouldn't even say I have an edge, but I mean I don't fuck around with some things. Like sometimes like I'll get into a fight with my mother because mom. Did you ever say that? I've never said fuck. You mean that would be.

Speaker 3:          01:34:33       Have never said fuck him. I'm learning. The only thing I've raised my voice or my mom, I haven't raised my voice, but I get angry in a way that I never would have because you become a grownup at a certain point and it's a bit of a bummer, but you're like, Shit. Yeah. Like my mom always asks about my dog. I have a dog and she, we never had a dog. So I honestly think my mom thinks I don't know how to raise a dog, so I'll tell her on the phone. I'll just be like, mom, we're going to go. She's like, what are you up to you? I'm just like, oh, you know, a val and I are going to go get some lunch or whatever, and she's like, is brody coming? What are you going to do with the dog? And all I'm hearing is like, you can't handle a dog.

Speaker 3:          01:35:10       Like it just feels like this attack and I'll just be like, mom, I've told you a thousand times, so I try to make jokes. I'm like, well, I'm going to keep brody into an active volcano and I'm going to cut off his head so he doesn't have to suffer, you know, while we're gone and she doesn't like that. So we butt heads in a way that we never did. That's interesting to know. Your mom was at her idea to raise you super religious? Yeah, there's, there's definitely some latent resentment there too. And I got married because my mom was like, you should get married. That's just true. We went to Chili's in Burlington. Maybe you've been there. Children, Tim Vermont, Burlington, mass. Right by the mall. I know Burlington coat factory. They're more than great coats. We went and I had the Nacho Burger. It's Nacho ordinary burger. And my mom was like, you should get married.

Speaker 3:          01:35:55       And I was like, okay, that's how much of a mama's boy I went. Wow. Because I was 22, I was moving to Chicago to do Improv because I heard the story of Chris Farley, he moves from Madison to Chicago. He gets us an out and that's what I wanted to do. So I was like, I'm going to move to Chicago. I'm not going to break up with my wife or my girlfriend at the time. And I didn't know if I, if we could live in sin, you know what I mean? Like I didn't know if I can make that move. So she was like, just get married. It's fine. And I, you know, I, I get where she was coming from, but I do think there's some latent like, hey, maybe it'd be like, just live in sin for a while. See how that goes. It's hard for some people.

Speaker 3:          01:36:34       It's not an option. You know? Some people that are really religious in the last thing she would want to do is tell her friends, well that's what the church, it's the, it's the expectation of like, you can't have a son who's living with this girl. Like I was the golden boy. I don't know how you were in your family, but I was like her, like it was so clear that she loved me the most. Like she's like obsessed with me and we're still close, but she, she kinda guided me in that way. But that's kind what crashing is about. It's like these things that you would never ask for taking you to the place you were afraid to go. So she leaves, you know, how'd you find out? She told me. Well, she took me to dinner hollow. She got me linguine with clams, which was my favorite dishes.

Speaker 3:          01:37:17       Is it really good? A lovey and I still eat. Hardly ever do, but when I do, yeah, I know what you mean. Treat. I know he been trying not to eat the pasta, but when I do, yeah, it's almost worth it. It's worth it. So we got that. And then it's, it's a sad story. She also took me to a liquor store to buy alcohol for that night. I don't know what's going on. I'm like, the puppy that's getting driven to the vet to be put down. And then we went home and she had a left, she had a script and she goes, uh, I love you. I want what's best for you. And I'm like, Oh hey, thanks. And she was like, uh, you deserve to be with someone who really loves you. And I'm like, I agree. Yeah, I'm glad to just not getting Jesus Christ.

Speaker 3:          01:37:59       Number three was, I don't want to be a cheating wife. And I go, so don't be. That was my response. And then she was dead silent and then I was like, is there someone else? I said it as a joke, like I felt like I was in a TV show and I was like, is there someone else like, as if that could be a thing. Her silence was deafening. And then I swear to God, Joe, my next question was, is it a comedian? And she goes, no, and I go, this is later in the conversation. I go, you're leaving me for us civilian.

Speaker 2:          01:38:30       Oh God.

Speaker 7:          01:38:32       See, I love comedians. How could you date a comedian and hang out with my comedian friends and we'd go to shows. And it's, I love show business. I love comedy. How could you leave the best thing, the best people?

Speaker 2:          01:38:47       Wow. So what? I thought. That's ridiculous. Oh, you don't agree with me. You think that's stupid? Well, that comedians are fun. Well, I'm sure they're fun for some people. The idea that the only, I mean obviously I'm sure I probably would've thought at the time too, if you talked to me when I was 22 it 20, or when I was 28. I think when you're really deep in love with something, it becomes the only world that you can imagine.

Speaker 3:          01:39:13       Well, that now with my current fiance, French for wife, I don't know if it's a comedy bit. Oh, it's a comedy joke for bits. Um, I just laugh at that one too. I will lend Jay, you will kill me, but I will lend you to you. I'll get one good line, jen. I feel like any comedian, uh, is in a threeway there's something where there's this other thing and it really helps if Valerie likes to fuck comedy as well, and she does well. That's interesting. She likes traveling, she likes the, she likes my friends. She likes it. If she can get me a bed or try out something together,

Speaker 2:          01:39:50       that's cool. She actually can come up with some shit too. That's really fun to watch you do it. That's got to be really fun.

Speaker 3:          01:39:56       Nothing better than doing the show. And you know, at Largo, I have a monthly show at Largo and she's sitting on the stage, but behind the curtain and hearing her laugh and I'm riffing and she'll, she'll, I never asked her to. But God, it really made me, made our love that much deeper. She just started writing down. If I set a new line, she just emailed him. Wow, that's cool to me. And I was like, Oh, let's get married.

Speaker 2:          01:40:20       That's cool. We should be married. You know, there's a weird thing that happens to a lot of comedians when they get involved in a relationship like a first. The girl thinks it's cool, like I'm dating this guy. He's just. He's a comedian. He's wild. He's so funny. He says funny things and then it becomes you have to work every night. That's funny. You have to work tonight. Why don't you just stay home, stay home with me. I have the night off. I've

Speaker 3:          01:40:43       been in relationships like that. I have to, and this isn't. I'm glad this isn't one of them, but I've also calmed down. I wonder if you have at a certain point, I'm happy to report to our species comedians that I think there is a level that you reach where you relax a little bit. You've, you've gone in the fancy green room and you've eaten the apple pie and you just go like, okay, I've. I've seen the strings at the puppet show. We can keep playing the game, but I'm not as desperate or afraid as I used to be. I'm like, it's a marathon. There's ups, there's downs and there's a lot of other shit to life than comedy. I don't do sets every night anyway. That's kind of like A. I'm like a three times a week ago. I think three times a week is fine.

Speaker 3:          01:41:25       I don't do it every night either. Um, but I think the discipline, when you are confident in your discipline, it can mitigate some of the negative aspects of obsession because like, you know, you're doing the work, you're putting in the work. Like you don't feel bad taking a night off. That's right. We got, you know what somebody said that really changed the game for me was live a life worth commenting on. That's good. You can't just go out and next thing you know, you're just doing bits about motels, hotels, holiday inns and fucking airplanes. I get that. But if I just go to a concert or just go camping or just go on a trip and have not. And not even thinking like, could I get a bed out of this? I can go to a sensory deprivation tank and not go, what's the bit here?

Speaker 3:          01:42:10       Oh, salt on my asshole. I'm not thinking that, I'm just like, this is life and that's, that's. I think that's the way we should be. We can't. There is this three way thing going on, but I'm not as starved anymore. Do you remember some balance? It's definitely a balance, but when you started, that's kind of one of the other things that show is about is that fervor that you have when you're starting, where you're like, it actually got cut, but there was a scene we wrote where it was like if you're holding your girlfriend in one hand and comedy and the other which will and lauren lap guests who plays my wife did this really funny ref because she's like, if you're holding me and you're holding comedy over a cliff, which one you pull up like the good son and I had to think about it and while I'm thinking about it, she just knows she's bawling and she's right.

Speaker 3:          01:42:56       That there's something. I hope that people when they watch the show, I understand that. I understand why my wife left me in real life and also why the character, the kind of pretend wife on the show. Also left. I think that's the same with rock and roll. I think it's probably the same with art. I think it's probably the same with everything that you become obsessed with sometimes when people were involved in a relationship, especially when they're young. It seems like your whole world to a person who doesn't have this other obsession, like comedy, like say if you have just a regular job, you're working at an insurance company or something like that and your boyfriend's a comedian, your girlfriend's a comedian and you just want to get home and have dinner and sit down with them and they have to rush off to the city to do some fucking sat and he won't be home until 2:00 in the morning.

Speaker 3:          01:43:40       Not Great. It's not good. It's not what you want it. Yeah. It has it in real life. My wife said I don't want to be Pete Holmes is why I kinda get it. I get it. Like even at the time I was like the sex, but I kinda get it. Makes Sense. That makes sense. And then someone might want to be though. That's the thing. It's like, yeah, no matter what there is about your life, it's about finding someone who can appreciate whatever that is about your life and help you. Yeah, I know it's typically something people say about kids, but like seeing the world through their eyes. Like we go talk about the four seasons. Okay. You do a corporate gig and they put you up at the four seasons and you and I have done that before you bring the new person, the excited person.

Speaker 3:          01:44:19       It's so fun to surprise Valerie with that. It's so fun to go to the show together. I just did a corporate and it was brutal. I got the back sweat, dry mouth. It just, you know, they're never great. Right. Those things. And she was there and we laugh about. It's like we should share the adventure. She has her own thing. She works for a charity called real girl, which is a female empowerment program. Uh, I know feminism is a cancer. I'm just kidding. But that's what she does. But it's flexible enough that we can, we can go to New York and filmed the show and come to La and do shows in Hawaii or whatever it might be. That's awesome, man. You, you found some. I think I've always made this analogy that people are kind of like the fingers of two hands and if they fall together like that where it's a perfect fit.

Speaker 3:          01:45:00       You're, you're in, you're in. But a lot of times people get this thing going on where you get those bottom two fingers with the top two fingers. On the other hand is a lot of wildland fire. Missed high five. It's. Yeah, exactly. You know, it's funny, the last person that did that for me, again, the crashing is about these stories of when you're starting and when it sucks. I really think that's kind of the most interesting thing. A lot of shows that I love about comedians are about comedians when they're successful and that's fine. That's great. This is a show about these times and when I was opening for Bill Burr, and this is 10 years ago, I was in Peoria. I actually made a youtube video of it called Pete Holmes bombing where I kind of do commentary on it when I got off stage, he was like, you want it to be like this, but you were like this like the whole time just describing it to people you want it to be like the hands intersect perfectly, but the fingertips are smashing into each other and he was absolutely right.

Speaker 3:          01:45:51       You know when you're bombing and it just feels like the words are just getting sucked into a vacuum. There's no connection. Well, you have no connection with it so the audience is never going to have a connection with it and it's impossible for you to have a connection with because you know you're bombing and you're pretending to have a good time. And here's the rub is my comedy typically comes from a positive place. Like, um, I like to lean into my sweetness and my enthusiasm and wonder. So if I, like, this happened I was at in Irvine and I was onstage and I had this bid about a Lululemon. This hoodie that I'm actually wearing is a Lulu lemon. I just like Lulu Lemon, who fucking cares. So I have a bit about it though. Like any comedian. So it's my opener. Sometimes I go, this is a Lulu Lemon, I just don't want you wondering. The whole show. And then the setup of the next joke is I think I think people like ladies, like a guy in a Lulu, it says something about them and then this girl, this isn't the first 30 seconds of my first, first row girl big table because you're gay, you're gay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       And I just kind of wiped it out and was like, it's 2016. How you're fucking ignorant. Like just kinda like what it. People were laughing but I was just leaned into her and then I had to try to merge back into my silly, silly, fun boy comedy routine. I literally have a light in my act back then where I go, I don't know how to be angry. It's. And that's usually like a big laugh. They'd already seen me be very angry. You got mad when she said you're gay because of a Lululemon lawn. When you just assume that that's seems like that's what someone would say it maybe if I last for 35 seconds, but you left the gap, right? Are you siding with this crazy woman? It's a heckle, obviously. Never side with a heckler in the first 30 seconds and I'm doing the setup and you go, you're gay or was there someone on before you?

Speaker 1:          01:47:38       Yeah, the two opening. So they were drinking, so this lady probably lit up. You get on, she's been hearing people say, shit, that's marginally funny because they're not as funny as you because of the openers. And she's like, I think I can find. I'm fine. He says, you're gay. Hate is. I think it says something about me. Right. That's so obvious. Yeah, you're gay. Everybody would say that. And 90 nine point nine percent of the time people have the decency to go. It's probably going somewhere guard against the guard. Against that one. 10th of one percent. Yeah. Come up with a better name. You know what I can counter argue. Don't do that for sure. Remain vulnerable. One hundred percent. Get heckled. Yeah. Get some scars. That's okay because I don't like bulletproof comedians. Well, you're not. You're never bulletproof. First of all, and second of all prepare for someone saying you're gay because it's coming again.

Speaker 1:          01:48:29       That Joe 100 percent. I. So do you have a. Did you have a backup line? Like when she said you're gay? If I had been in a better mood, maybe I would have had mode, but I don't know homophobia, like I hate the word, but it's that homophobic to say that it says you're gay. There's nothing wrong with being gay, so there's nothing wrong with being gay and gay people are very fashionable and someone says something about you. Let's unpack that a little bit. I do take offense at the idea that people into gentler or more flowy yoga meditation, things are therefore weaker and being weak is like being gay and being gay is like being Frou Frou or like a ferry or whatever you want to say. If you make an offensive to a group of people, that makes sense, but you're making a giant leap by saying that someone is into Lulu Lemon, which is really nice. Clothes that make really good fitness clothes, sure, and that that somehow or another is weak. I don't think it's weak at all, but it's called Lulu Lemon Joe Lulu lemon shirt, but the point is that women assume that men who are really fashionable or into fashion and understand and appreciate fashion yet, but then times 10, can we talk about black people love fried chicken and watermelon fried chicken is delicious because everybody loves fried

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       chicken and large groups of people that aren't gay like looking fashionable. Right? So what's going to be allowed to make? Then I discouraged that. I agree with you. I agree with him also saying I defend my right to discourage. I agree with you, but I think that if you are a standup comedian working in a unit that sells alcohol, I feel like the student being taught by the message. That is true, right? I should've been like, you got to say you left it open like I would if I was your friend spur of a second. Too Long in the $30 to come see me and you're like, I'm going to fuck this guy shit up. Well, it's just natural. It's a natural, wise ass thing to say by someone who has like one person at the office to do better. I want us to to do.

Speaker 3:          01:50:38       I expect my audiences to be better. I want the clubs to be better. I want us to elevate our game. The people always like to say do better. You know what's another thing that people like to say that's really disturbing? The worst is the worst. The worst is being eaten. Asshole first by hyenas. Okay. That's the worst. Anything other than that? We really stopped calling it the worst. People love to say that. Oh, Pete Holmes. The worst that guys. The worst. He had a joke about homophobia. He's the worst. It's such an overused term. It's so stupid. He cut her term that people are using today where they just throw it in. Oh, you're the worst. I'm going to join. You know, I think people have arrested development. Literally. They stopped for sure developing. So in fifth grade you realize that you could win friends by keeping your shoe's untied.

Speaker 3:          01:51:27       You're a bad boy. And also being like, you didn't have the cool kid with the untied shoes. No Man. Never. Alright then let's just untie your confusing as shit. I mean Jamie, you with them on this January kid who doesn't give a shit as easy as you can. Even just when it comes to shoes tied shoe thing, for sure. The kid who doesn't give a fuck. I'm older than you. Maybe. Maybe I missed that. That's true. The kid who didn't tie his horse to the stable and that was the guy that, you know, he's a rebel bro. His horse just wanders around. The navy calls it with a whistle like red dead. I love it, but forget the shoe tying into a stretch. But these guys that learned how to win friends by going, oh, ms dot Johnson sucks. Right? Right, right. And then they just learn like sarcasm can be so funny.

Speaker 3:          01:52:14       But I think so many people that just misappropriating sarcasm by saying whatever it is, sex, if I'm eating a Burrito in the bottom falls out. They go though it looks like a good, like that's not funny. You're just being a dick. But in their twitter bio UC, like sarcasm is just one of the many services I offer. You're just an asshole. That's not funny. Chandler are better with sarcasm. Right? But they probably are trying and failing just like we try and fail with jokes. Like Lulu Lemon joke isn't that. But you know what I'm saying? I mean all try and fail. Gearhart bad you, you hate as a lack of imagination and you are stepping into other people's shoes. She was probably lit. She's probably trying to be funny. She doesn't know it. Tape. We're trying to be concerted effort of someone trying to fuck things up for me to actually experienced hate towards them.

Speaker 3:          01:53:03       It was because of the, you know, you could get, look, I could go on stage in a bad mood. It can happen. Older women with wine. And it was like I don't feel like you're a friendly crowd. It can happen. It can happen. And my opener, who is gay, Brian Sullivan Kinda didn't do very well and it was just kinda like you guys are giving me the wrong vibe. And I thought maybe it was a teachable moment, but sometimes it's like you didn't establish the moment properly, you know, sometimes like I'll look back at some lines that I used to like, but they, they just didn't do that well. And I'm like, did I just get attached to this line? Did I stop it? Did I have a development in my standup? Yeah, yeah, because I sort of got attached to saying something this way because I had been doing it like that for six months or whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:53:48       And then you realize like, oh, that's not a good way to set it up. I need to just, I'll actually tell my babies, you know, that expression I've heard kill your darlings that kill you. Kill your babies in terms of creatively, creatively, you have to kill some of the ideas, but you're attached to them because they're yours. You painful. Yeah. That's a lot of what writing is for. Yes. I'll go. One word is shit on my own experience. Uh, when you craft an act for fans and I know you know this feeling, then you go to a club where you know, Irvine, I don't think the crowd was necessarily there to see me. Remember, you're like, oh shit. Yes. Stand up is more like boxing. Then I remember. Oh yeah, because if you like, if you watch my special, it's all fans. You get a standing ovation when you're coming out.

Speaker 3:          01:54:30       And I love that. I'm going to quote Sinbad said that he goes, I love, I love this quote. He goes, certainly is a very nice guy. He was great. He did my podcast. Tony Hinchcliffe says he's awesome. Talk about leaving your body. Astral projection. Same bad. Does it? He asked truly projects, astral project, how's he do that? He stopped doing well. There's all these techniques, there's books and stuff about it. The long and the short is you get into a trance and you imagine a rope above you. Then pull yourself down or what he did actually remember, he was like, I put something just out of my reach. And then you're trying, as you're laying there with your eyes closed, meditating, you're trying to reach the thing. And then he said he felt his hand wrapped around it and that's how he knew he had left his body and he did it for months and months and months and months.

Speaker 3:          01:55:13       And then one day he said he was like in this weird place he was in the cave. Something like shadow creature came up and hit him in the chest. I know this is sinbad, remember Eddie goes. And it felt like someone had cracked me in the chest with a sledge hammer and he was like, I never did it again. Whoa. And I was like, really? You got to go back? Try and find like booby island or something. He's right though. Maybe he's ready to be snatched up by the demons and stranger things. It is next dimension demon that lives in the wall. It is scary. If you read a journey's out of the body are far. Journey is a Robert Monroe in

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       the fifties. It's like you read this book and he still calls black people negros and stuff like you can tell it's an old old book, but he's telling that's how old this stuff is. It's goes way back. He would tell stories about like seeing something fly by and being very concerned that that thing was trying to get into his body before you needed. So it's kind of a scary thing. But anyway, but don't you think that dreams and you know, moods like states of mind, like the state of mind that you had when you went on stage that time, the state of mind that you have when you have a fucked up dream, it's like the ability to do that, your mind has to change stances and positions and that these stances and positions really greatly affect how you react to a situation. So you're coming into something with so much baggage and so much good or bad.

Speaker 4:          01:56:29       Like sometimes you come into something and you'd be in the best mood ever. And like I got rear ended by this undocumented worker and uh, he's a, a guy was illegal in the country. He was from Mexico, he didn't have insurance and I had, it was my favorite car. I have a porsche nine slash 11, gt three. It's a race car to car to drive. I've had it for years. I love it. It's just like really light car that sound in this guy fucking plowed into them and the engine's in the back. Yeah. And I was like, oh no, I was thinking my car's fucked. But luckily he don't like when he hit the brakes he was texting of course. And when he, uh, and traffic was stopped and he looked up and I saw him look up. I saw him in the rear view mirror and I saw his face.

Speaker 4:          01:57:13       I saw him slam on the brakes. I'm like, this guy's going to hit me for sure. And he had a Honda civic and his car went under my car because, you know, when you break dive, you know, your car dips down. Wow. So his car literally like, ran into my car but kind of lifted it up and sent me a flying. Yes, he sent me fine and crushed his car. Um, but it was luckily that he had a light car and it damaged my car, but they will, they fixed it pretty quickly, but at that moment I got out of the car and I was in the best state of mind that day. I had been doing a lot of yoga and it just, everything was going good. I was feeling positive and generous and friendly and I, I talked to him and I was like, I go, do you have a license?

Speaker 4:          01:57:54       He's like, no, I go, boy, driving, you don't have a license. And he was honest. He goes, I gotta work, man. I grew up and uh, I called, uh, I don't remember what I called a tow truck or if I called the police. I don't remember what I did because we pulled out, his car was fucked. My car drove to the comedy store. I drove that night but I was going to get his information and everything and I was going to stick around for the cops and tell the cops that, you know, this guy doesn't have a license and this and that. And I'm like, fuck this. I'm like, alright man, have a good night. I just drove away. I just drove away. I got so nervous that you were about to tell me a story where you're like, and then the cops came. So I signed autographs while they arrested this guy.

Speaker 4:          01:58:35       I bolted. I didn't want to tell on him. I'm like, she's like, it's 25 year old kid from Mexico is trying to make it, trying to, you know, try and make some money. You trying to do better demonstrated grace. Well, I also, I was in a good state of mind like I could've been in a terrible state of mind. I could have been ramped up, I could have gotten in some altercation, some dickhead at yet because of this will fuck that guy and this guy hit me, man, what the fuck, you know, you, you come into it already ramped up. That's right. But that moment made me realize like you can go into a moment, like if you could be at a, in the best state of mind you can do regardless of the circumstance. That's right. Well, you know, it's funny that you said that because I had that kind of are.

Speaker 4:          01:59:15       This is actually just had an argument with my mother and then we went to dinner and I was in the best mood before that I was, I meditated and I just felt amazing and then I called my mom because I was feeling good. I was like, I can, I can handle a call home, got in a bad mood. Immediately. Val and I were going to dinner and then we're at dinner and I'm just kind of complaining about it and then she's like, what if, what if we changed your frequency a little bit? She, I don't even know if she used that word, but she was like, what are we grateful for? And that's Kinda like where you were. You had just been doing yoga and stuff. We just started making a list. It wasn't like it wasn't huge big things. It was just like, I'm grateful that we have.

Speaker 4:          01:59:50       We have a car before we can come to this restaurant, that we have the money right now to eat this meal. I'm grateful for this body. I'm grateful for the help and you were talking about earlier, gratitude, man. That's how to get yourself into that place so important and to exercise gratitude consciously all the time, just to be happy and thankful and generosity. Generosity is another thing that's really. That'll change your frequency for sure. I think those, those things, and gratitude also shifts your perspective and gets you to understand that, boy, I could be in Africa right now living in the Congo and malaria. You know, I could be fucked. I could be in some worn torn part of the world where I'm trying to escape. That's right. You know this. I think that's also one of the things that people find so disturbing about this trump ban on immigrants.

Speaker 4:          02:00:36       You know, now they're telling you they're not calling it a band anymore, but seth meyers is the hilarious thing where they were saying that it's not a band that he showed all these clips of pence and trump and all these different people calling it a band, a band, the band, the band, the band, the band, and um, it, it hurts people when you know that this is a country that was founded on immigrants and this is a country that everyone in this country was originally an immigrant that was our native Americans. Native Americans, by the way, we're fucking immigrants too because 10,000 years ago, this entire country was covered by two miles of ice. Okay? I mean, this, this, everyone came here from somewhere else. I mean is in terms of recent humans we recent being the last 20,000 years, everyone came from somewhere else. When they do these genetic examinations of native Americans, one of the things they find is they, they, they share common ancestors in Siberia means they came across the bering strait when it was connected.

Speaker 4:          02:01:36       And this is just, this is the price where people come. That's our idea. Yeah, so when you're blocking these people that are in one of the worst places in the world, Syria, you know, and then there was like this list of all these Muslim countries where people are allowed to come into America problems and there's so many fucking people and so many different countries that are Muslim. I mean it's whether it's Pakistan or Indonesia, but then there's politics involved in that. I think somebody pointed out that a lot of like Saudi Arabia or wherever, these are places where there are trump hotels. I don't know. I don't know if that's true either, but the real issue is Syria is the hot topic and I don't necessarily think this guy has the time, nor does he have the inclination to deeply look into things with a, a greater perspective than what he currently has.

Speaker 4:          02:02:21       Right. You would think that, you know, Howard stern had a very interesting thing that he said about Donald Trump and I would defer to him because I think he knows Donald Trump personally and he said that he doesn't think that this is good for Donald. Like his mental health, which I thought it was interesting because Howard was coming at it like as a friend and he said essentially the donald wants to be loved, and he said that that's what he wants. All these people that love him and he's like, I don't think this is a good job for him. For his mind. I know it's fucking crazy. That is crazy. I remember when Chappelle hosted snl and he was like, I'm going to give him a shot. That's what we were putting ourselves. Right. Those of us that weren't on board with him, we were there. We only have this one thing that's right now the disturbing thing, right?

Speaker 4:          02:03:03       There's not really a lot of other stuff. There's this one that the ban on immigrants is really. It's an issue because there's families that are coming over here and they have children and you see them and they're sad and desperate. It's scary. You know you're leaving your home, your, your seeking refuge in America. You have a travel visa and you can't get in. That scares the fuck out of people because you think that could be me. That could be my mom, that could be my sister. Right? That was my mom. My mom fled world war two from Lithuania. There you go. So I mean, come on. That's insane. That is fucking insane. I mean it scares the shit out of us when we think that we could be. So Zena phobic that we could just put this like this blanket statement, but let's wait. You said earlier it becomes them, but on the other side you don't want what's happening in Germany.

Speaker 4:          02:03:46       You don't want what's happening in France. You don't want. We have these people that aren't integrating with the culture and they're creating these significant problems and you have like what Merkel is dealing with right now in Germany, this culture clash and you're having a lot of problems between people and these radical Muslim elements and they're, they're isolating and creating their own neighborhoods and you know, and people don't want to integrate. They want to bring a piece of their country here and they have extremely different values mean whether you want to be critical of these people that live in the Middle East or not the reality. And we all know this, when you look at the rights that women in Saudi Arabia or are denied the right to drive, they have to wear certain clothing. They have to have to look away when men are looking at them. I mean there's a lot of shit that these women have to deal with that is a cultural standard in their part of the world that doesn't fly.

Speaker 4:          02:04:41       And if they bring that over to Germany, then you see these men that are from that part of the world that are in their thirties or whatever. There are grown adults know whatever the age and that is their standard of behavior and now they're seeing white women in Germany, these German women that are not behaving then not acting in that standard and they feel like these women are harlots. They feel like these women are sluts and they can just do whatever they want with them. And you're finding. I mean there's not how many of them, how many incidents are there? I don't know, but there's enough where it's a significant issue. There's enough that this is something that needs to be discussed. Like you have these, this new element that you brought in and how do you mitigate that without being racist, without being seen in public?

Speaker 4:          02:05:20       How do you, how do you, how do you somehow or another encourage these people to evolve their culture? Because that's a real issue. It is very interesting. It, it did make me think of the word both from Boston and the Irish, you know, segregated kept to themselves and they were Irish neighborhoods. It gets tricky when something is so culturally different for us. They do have a right to have their neighborhood be however, they weren't sure, but for some reason it could be racism. It could be just a. it's not normal to us. The way that they behave with women or the way that they want women to behave that well, that's not racism. That's a, it's a huge issue. I understand. I don't want women to be sublimated and what's interesting is that you would think that that would be totally in opposition of liberal values, but the liberals are the ones that are like really concerned with these people, with people not being Islamophobic, which is also a good thing to think, but there has to be some rational and reasonable consideration for the cultural differences that are vast and real and scary and also they're incredibly restrictive on women.

Speaker 4:          02:06:31       Incredibly restrictive and on homosexuals. I mean what you're seeing with isis thrown gay people off rooftops and in Iraq and some horrible, horrible shit that is the standard in that part of the world and when you're dealing with a culture that is just perot programmed, programmed for so long to be oppressive towards homosexuals, to be oppressive towards women, like violently oppressive. You know, where they think you're allowed to beat women. I watched one of the most horrible videos and I should have never watched it, but it was a a man and his daughter and the daughter had been accused of adultery and so he was going to be the guy there was stoning his daughter to death and he was the first guy to throw the stone and his daughter was begging for mercy and reaching out to touch his hand and he wouldn't touch her hand and he hit her with the Rock and then they all through the rock center and I was like, fuck, this is just a religion.

Speaker 4:          02:07:28       Just an ideology that forces people into this and if you take these people that are so deep in that ideology and so deep that brainwashing and then you bring them over to a free country to a democratic country that has an open policy on religion and freedom of expression. Do whatever you want. You're gonna. Have A. You're gonna have a problem. There's going to be some sort of a gap that needs to be crossed and I don't know how to do it. How do you. How do you make those people evolve? Their ideas? I just don't know.

Speaker 4:          02:08:00       Scary. I don't even. It's crazy. So when you think about people coming into this country hand, we were new at this and there's gonna be mistakes and there's going to be things like that seem unsolvable problems. There is the human life element of it. We know that there's a basis of like people are dying and they need help. Yes, and then we go, well, people that we may not agree with her dying and need help, but you still go, we don't need to take lsd to go, well, you still need to help people that you don't agree with. You're right, it's, that's not the issue and the vast majority, let's be really clear, are never going to cause any problems. The vast majority are going to integrate fine. They're going to have friends that are Christians and baptists, Mormons and whatever, and then there's going to be no issues.

Speaker 4:          02:08:43       The vast majority, but there is going to be. There's going to be a few issues and when those issues pop up, then it always becomes highlighted. Oh, it's their religion. It's their ideology, you know, it could be mental health issues. They just overturn something here in America though that it was like, it's no longer a federal or I don't know. I don't know the legal speak, but it's no longer as serious of an offense as it used to be to beat your wife. So no, that was actually in Egypt. No, where was it was just. It was just a law that was just. Hold on a second. There was just a law that was just past. Where the fuck was that?

Speaker 4:          02:09:19       God Damn it. I tweeted about it. Oh, Russia was in Russia. Russia. Russia. Yeah. Crazy. Like domestic violence is decriminalized in Russia if it doesn't cause severe injury. We also, what I'm saying is we also have people here that are very backwards about women and gays, that we have plenty of them and they're also here. I'm just trying to advocate the Saudis and a lot of the Middle Eastern countries take that shit to a whole new level. I human aren't even allowed to drive. Right. I mean they have to have a male companion when they go out at night. I mean, there's, there's some unbelievably regressive ideas that are just accepted because we don't want to appear to be homophobic or excuse me, Islamophobia. And then there's Bob, uh, I think, is it Bob Jones? There's a Christian university where there's blue sidewalls for boys and pink for girls.

Speaker 4:          02:10:08       So everybody's fucked what I'm saying. Right. But they're not stoning people. They're not having a fighter. Just, I mean, you just scarred me emotionally. Honor, killing. Honor killing is a real thing. Yeah. I mean this is not, this is not like an imaginary idea that's never enforced. It's a real thing. So it's female genital mutilation. He talked to Ian Hirsi Ali about it and she gets labeled in Islamophobia because she talks openly about the problems with the ideology and she's a woman who experienced female genital mutilation. I mean she was, that she had to flee her country and now she's here writing books and giving lectures. And the hardcore left the far left. Crazies are attacking her as being Islamophobic. But

Speaker 3:          02:10:52       you know what's interesting about these very, very complicated, and you've just illuminated me in many ways, a issues is when things get really, really complicated, we do take comfort in what I call like the slingblade mentality. Remember slingblade? Yeah. So there's dad. Alright. Some people call it a kaiser blade. I call it a sling blade. So that movie is like strangely pleasant in this weird way because the boy has the abusive father and the mother and they're being held captive by this drunk asshole. Spoiler alert. It's from the nineties. You should have seen that by now, right? Incomes. A simple man who is a graceful character, a compassionate character, and he kills the dad. He hits him in the head with a sling blade. That's why the movie's called Sling Blade and he kills the guy. So it is this complicated thing. The drunk dad is a person.

Speaker 3:          02:11:44       We could zoom out on him and be like, okay, why is he drinking? What's going on? How can we help them? How can we rehabilitate this guy? But there's something about being a human that occasionally John Wick style, you just want a guy to go in and shoot a bunch of a bunch of people. Just clean the problem up in a simple way. What I'm saying? Punch Nazis. That's what I'm saying. There you go. So complicated issues somehow attract overly simple response, especially because people are lazy. That's what. That's where racism comes in. You Go. I'm afraid that some people are dangerous. Well, these guys say black people are dangerous. Ah, I feel a little bit more comfortable because I look around the store and there's. None of them would really. There's a white guy that'll fuck you up just as bad as anybody in that same store.

Speaker 3:          02:12:28       But we're looking for these click moments where we just go, John Wick shot the guy, go to bed. And that's what I think. And I'm actually trying to understand trump supporters. I think there's a slingblade thing going on with trump where he's like, look, what are we going to do? These people want to come in. Nobody likes people dying. But these people may be. There's this threat of this changing the culture, changing women being bad this way, violent this way. Oh, let's just not let them in. It's like a panic answer, you know what I mean? And it appeals. That was one of the things that I find not too many people like me, I don't agree with trump, but when I would watch the debates, I would catch something in my brain going, oh, this guy's driving the car. You know what I mean? Like he was such a blow hard and he had solutions that if I was quiet enough, I could recognize the part in my own psyche that went. Data will protect us. Yeah. There's the appeal of the strong man, a strong confident man who stands in front of all us and tells us he got it. But if we can admit that, and I'm trying to admit that as much as I, then

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       we don't see my sister getting pepper sprayed by my brother. You know what I mean? Like we're all in it together. That's what I talk about. Good discourse. We need to go like Jon Stewart was like, these guys aren't afraid of Muslims. They're afraid of their health insurance premiums. That was such a great quote. He was like, this plan was fucking them. They couldn't afford their insulin, so trump comes in and he's like, don't worry about it. I'm going to get you jobs. I'm going to get you this. I'm going to get you that and some other stuff. Some hateful stuff is coming along with it, but they didn't have the luxury of of being like, well, I got to go with Hillary. They couldn't I guess. Well, simplistic speak and when you're in it's coming from someone that holds the highest of high offices in our country is very dangerous because if you simplify things and say them in sort of a a just a kind of a block headed way.

Speaker 1:          02:14:21       Yeah. It appeals to blockheads football game. We can't go out there and when they don't have to think now because you're not thinking you're the leaders thinking like a blockhead. That's what I can think like a blockhead to when Obama became president and I loved Obama, I didn't follow too closely, so I'm kind of a doofus in that way, but I loved the man that he was and he seemed to do a good job, but he definitely inspired a lot of young black people to be like, oh, I could. This could happen for me. I could be the president. Look at that example, and now I do think there is a risk of being like, well, look at this guy who calls, uh, what's her name of fat ass and a pig? And he became president, right? Who are you to tell me not to bully this kid in my class?

Speaker 1:          02:15:03       I could be the president. I called him a homo. I can be the leader of the free world. It's dangerous. That becomes dangerous when you have someone who's the spokesperson who speaks in like, again, these simplistic terms, right? But when you look at what Obama really did, there was a bunch of issues where he didn't buck the system where he did have the most drone strikes. Have any president ever where he did crack down on whistle blowers, right where he did the opposite of what he said and his hope and change website where we wound up pulling that down because he had this whole segment in there about whistleblowers and protecting whistleblowers who are showing that there's some sort of illegal activity going on. Well that's not the case at all because everything that Edward Snowden did was show illegal activity. I mean, he's kind of exonerated Chelsea Manning, you know, so this is going to have that kind of interesting.

Speaker 1:          02:15:53       That's why I can't pick it up or lay it down. You just have to look at it and allow that. There's some bullshit right away because when I see Obama, some great vine of him meeting a basketball player and they do this whole shake and play some of them and he's the coolest guy. He's articulate as he said, and he's intelligent and he and he looks cool and all that stuff. Yeah. That guy also that morning had a meeting where they decided how many drones to roll up shit. Well, not only that, the Dakota access pipeline, all that shit went down when he was the president when they were making those, those will. They're cutting through private property in arresting

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       ranchers because these ranchers did not want this fucking pipe going through their water system. That was all in his watch and he could've stopped that. He could've. He could've stepped in.

Speaker 3:          02:16:40       That's Kinda. It gets overwhelming and then we go, Geez, everyone is corrupt. Everyone's bought and paid for and that's where you get people not voting and that's when you get people going, let's let's light a Molotov cocktail and get somebody like trump in there. That's what he seemed like in the voting booth. It was like status quo or brick through the window and people were. It gets overwhelming and there's nothing more simple than a brick through the window.

Speaker 4:          02:17:04       Well, here's the thing, another thing that you were talking about earlier when you were saying about arrested development, and I do agree that I think we are in a sense in as a culture and human beings, it's. There's a great propensity, propensity to exhibit signs of arrested development. I think one of the reasons for that is that we have to work, I think working like doing a job that you just don't want to do, that you have to do because you have to feed yourself is one of the most soul sucking and mind numbing activities that a person could be trapped into doing and when you look at how many kids in this country are graduating in great debt, in massive debt because of student loans, and then they get into credit card debt that sort bounce out their student loans and you know they're deep into their thirties and they're fucked. They're in prison, they're in prison, and they're working all day doing something they don't want to do and they have to behave in a way that's not natural because it's the only way to keep this fucking stupid job. They never get to express themselves in a really honest and true way and

Speaker 3:          02:18:01       no mistake. It's not a hippy idea. We're all here to create. That's what the world is. The world is creation and we're here to take our insides and bring it.

Speaker 4:          02:18:09       Well, it's certainly. I don't know if we're here for that, but it certainly feels better to do that. I mean if you wanted to look at the greater picture of organic life on this planet and like, why are we here? Well, I don't. I don't know why. I don't know. I mean I don't think anybody knows. I think you could come up with all sorts of rationalizations for why we're here and what we're doing and what our purpose is, but is that purpose really. I mean we have a finite existence and will give birth to other things with the finite existences and during the time they're alive, the entire organism, a super organism of human beings is going to innovate and constantly continue to innovate at this exponential rate where we're going to be unrecognizable and a thousand years. We don't even know what the fuck the human race is going to look like a thousand years from now. So I don't know if that's what we're here for, but I certainly know that if you want to have a happy, it feels fulfilling life. Yeah. Being a creative person or by creative, it doesn't mean you have to be a musician, you have to be an architect.

Speaker 3:          02:19:02       The way that your appearance that can be creative, it's just finding a way to bring something.

Speaker 4:          02:19:07       Could be a bay under the executive love making cookies. You can like making tables or clocks like that. A cool clock say to the guy probably feels fulfilled as fuck. He could be a knife maker. It feels really good to be a part of creation. Does into an end or a carpenter or anything where you're doing something feels. There's lots of

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       things. I'm very interested in the idea of giving us everything that we think we want. We want food, we want entertainment, and then you have people staying in their houses that become like prisons. I'm sure you. I'm sure you've heard that idea. It's like, okay, let's say it doesn't have to be the Illuminati, but let's say this world certainly runs better when we can keep the cattle like occupied and. Okay, so we try to put as many people in prison as we can. If you see like documentaries like the 13th and stuff, that's one way to keep this. This last year, well how do we get these meds? Oh, well let's infect them with the idea of consumerism, so it's never enough. Your happiness is always the next thing. It's the next tv, it's the next phone, it's the next computer, it's the next meal, whatever it might be.

Speaker 1:          02:20:10       The next movie that you're gonna. See whatever it could be. So you're always in a state of lack going to keep you buying more money. You need more money, you need these things. Back in the day, you know, you read the newspaper and drink a glass of old team. Now you have to have a netflix subscription and you got to have Amazon prime and all the shit. So you're in debt, you're chasing it and you're never gonna get it and then at night you deserve it after your shit job to sit on the couch and zone out and that's how you keep us in line as well. Yeah, but I don't think that anyone. I'm one of those people in engineering that thing. I think that thing is a natural human inclination and I think it's also forced along by people that are trying to sell you the new lexus or I do want you to buy these clothes, or do you think wants can be encouraged.

Speaker 1:          02:20:55       I think we see that in other cultures where it's not as consumeristic as consumers stick is outward as ours is like we're certainly surrounded by advertising and all that. A capitalist culture, you know when you have capitalism and you have people that want to sell you the new apple laptop or the new android phone, they're going to advertise that phone. They're going to make it appealing because they wanted to sell well and if you have a really good advertising strategy, you can sell more stuff and so your. Your company becomes more successful but you're not outwardly thinking or even inwardly thinking you're going to make more slaves. They're going to make people that are forced into this consumeristic society and forced into this weird world weird world where you're living every day just to buy new stuff and just to get new stuff. It is sort of a symptom of the wrong way of thinking and these traps it's society set up for us, but I don't think it's necessarily engineered in a whole.

Speaker 1:          02:21:48       So this is a, this is a thing that people gravitate towards. This idea that there's this cabal of super geniuses that are running the world. I want to keep a stupid cheap. I don't think that's true. I think. I think it's a self fulfilling thing. I think we create these walls and we create this prison. We put up these bars and then we put ourselves inside and we lock them. But this is what's interesting about mushrooms was something that's free and something that has. There's no mushroom three point, oh, you don't have to get the new machine, but it is illegal. It is illegal because good citizens don't take psychedelics. Obedient citizens don't know. Was Jeff sessions was talking marijuana. Good people don't use marijuana. The same guy. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And, but you take that and you get a glimpse of real life. I know it's very, uh, kind of exaggerated and bizarre, but you get a sense that what we are and who we are fundamentally can be very, very interesting and worth exploring.

Speaker 1:          02:22:44       So to kind of also to your point, the people that make the laptop and make the ad campaign for the laptop, I don't think are trying to control the world, but I do think they like us. We're also indoctrinated into a world where you can justify the idea that I'm just giving them what they want because they too are, are stuck on that hedonic treadmill of like, I need the next thing. I need this job where I advertise this thing so I can go out and buy these things. Well that's the case with television. You know, I had a conversation with a friend of mine. He was like a super hippie. He was trying to tell me, you know what man? Fuck in the United States, man, their programming people with these shows, they're hypnotizing you to watch these bullshit programs and you get locked into it and it's all by design.

Speaker 1:          02:23:22       I go, here's why you're wrong. Fuck face. I work on those Goddamn show, so I'm going to tell you the funny once you start writing for TV or like there's no scale, there's no. There's no cabal of geniuses running and by the way, the people that are running these shows are hooked on other shows there in the shows. I'm like, I've seen game of thrones. I'm hooked, and they'll start telling you about all these fucking shows. That day was as much as I love a good conspiracy like Matt gradings and the and the masons, and they're these clues about nine slash 11 and the simpsons and stuff, and that can be fun and storytelling as such. Once I started writing for TV shows, I was like, oh, this is just a bunch of. Not Dummies, but regular folks like strange marriage. Funny. If a homeowner comes in and he's got blue pants, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          02:24:04       Like right. It's a strange marriage of art and commerce. You know, that's what it is. So you're creating something and you're trying to sell it and as you're trying to sell it then to make ads and they make as stupid as what they're doing. They're not. They're not trying to sell like, do you think coke coke is trying to make a stupid? No, they're trying to get. You'd think that fucking polar bales, your buddy. I'm like Santa Claus drinks. They're probably just trying to sell more shits. They can make more money to go golfing or whatever the fuck they want to do and they don't realize while they're doing it. I do. I think we want to enjoy this experience as much as we can. I think that's what we want to do that at our best, right at our best. We're toasting, we're clinking glasses were hugging each other at our best.

Speaker 1:          02:24:43       We're laughing with friends at our best. We're. We're just having a good time together. That's my favorite moments are me and my buddies just laughing about something, which is why comedians are so fun to hang out with and that's why I can't believe she left me for a guy named Rocco. We probably had a giant hog. I bet he did have a dream to have a big Dick. Like, yeah, it's like a lot longer. Well, this is it. When it's flat stock stock, a couple of them. This is him called pools and here comes my cold pool. Ruined or is there anything better than gaining perspective? I think there's a vonnegut quote where he goes, the best way to get in, get over a woman

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       is to turn her into fiction and there was something really Cathartic. The sort of crashing is fiction. My wife's character is completely different from my wife that situations are different, but it was still really fun. There's an episode with my parents and I'm writing them saying the annoying shit and my parents say it's not listening. My Mom's in love with me, all these things and I was like, this talk about zooming out. You have like this weird dominion over it. They call cut and you just, you know, that was just pretend that you're in it. Then it's pretend it was like 10 years of therapy wrapped into a couple of months. That's amazing. Do you still contact her? No, it's not out of hate or anything. I tend to move on, just move on. I don't, I don't talk to accept. My Ex's is a very dear friend of mine.

Speaker 3:          02:26:10       Um, but the rest of them you're just kind of like, it's hard because you're intimate with somebody and you know you have sex and you kiss and you hug and you want to. It takes a level of maturity but to have lunch with someone whose breasts you've seen and just be like, are you getting the soup? Yeah, it's hard. You know, and then you know, they tell you they're in love or they tell you they're getting married or having a kid, you're like, oh yeah, that's why I'm so glad my ex got married. She's coming to my wedding and, and my, and my girlfriend is very, very close with her. So I love it when it works out. I never thought I'd be one of those people. Oh. But it's amazing when it works out, it works out. It's great. And the idea that it can't work out as all silly too.

Speaker 3:          02:26:54       Of course it can. You know, I have friends that uh, like one of my buddies dated this girl and then he broke up with her and my other buddy one I'm marrying her. No, their friends. It's great. It does happen. It can happen. It totally can happen. Yeah. It's just everybody's not right for everybody else. Yeah. There's certain people that will drive you fucking crazy. But to someone out there, it's the perfect person. Well that's a funny tee shirt. It's like, no matter how much you love her, someone somewhere is sick of her shit. Have you seen those? That's an old old statement, right? It's true. Yeah. Valid. I have lived together for two years now and it's just, it's just been the best. That's awesome man. Because you found that thing right with the finger slide into the grooves and it works and it's like the idea that it's like if it doesn't do it, it's because someone's a bad person.

Speaker 3:          02:27:42       It just. No, man. I can't say that. That's something I try and stay on. You made it weird as much as possible as you don't have to hate someone to break up with them. It's good point. I think you had to be throwing plates and screaming at each other and someone's an alcoholic and someone cheats on somebody. It's okay to say, I do love you. I may regret this. Like just concede and be like, but I'd like to go and that's okay. I just like to be free. I'll tell you this story. I was dating this girl who for me seemed very crazy. I know that gets thrown around a lot, but I was like, I think this person's a borderline personality, all these different things. I had this list in my phone, in the notes file reasons to break up and it was 35, 45 things.

Speaker 3:          02:28:28       It was insane and any one of them would have been enough and I kept adding it to it and go to my therapist. Dr Gary Penn, whose book is available now. It's a joke I make on my podcast. He's like, Pete, you don't need a list. You don't need a list. And that same week I had talked to a psychic. I'm not huge into that stuff. I know I told you I'm a believer and the psychic is like someone is looking out for you in this regard in particular, like they're rooting for you. Whether or not that's true. I held onto that and I'm driving from therapy where my therapist is like, you don't need a list of reasons to break up with her, and I'm like, you're right, you're right. But I get in the car and I think of another one. I'm in the highway and I take out my phone and I start writing down the 47th reason to break up with this person. Phone crashes, restarts, opens up, everything's the same. That's. That note was deleted. Isn't that crazy? And whether or not that's actually mystical. It just meant something to me. It was like fucking a. If that's a coincidence, who cares? But it gave me the courage to be like, I don't need a reason. I want to bounce, I'm going to bounce, but I love you. I love you too. I don't like this.

Speaker 2:          02:29:36       Yeah. I want to be attached and connected to you. I'm sorry we had a good run. Maybe we'll let me the fuck outta here. I know you should be able to like people that you don't want to have sex with anymore. You don't want to be intimately attached with. And that's the other thing about people like intimate attachments. When you have intimate attachments with someone, like you have sex with them. Yeah. You share carnal pleasure. Boy, there's some fucking weird things that happened where people get angrier. You know they get fucking like the best thing you can do. If you want to really have a fun relationship with someone, and I've never done this, hold off on the sex as long as you can. Oh Wow. I get to know the. See if you really like each other, see if you really like each other.

Speaker 2:          02:30:21       See if it's not just a thing where you'd like should have been a Christian here. Feels good inside their body. That's what we do, but he would court. It's not the worst move. The problem is we have this fucking desire for sex. It's overwhelming. You know, it's like this, this ticking time bomb inside your body. Then we'll convince yourself like, judy is great to have these great. Sure. Convince Yourself. Let's just fuck. I got married to it in a bit. We had sex before we got married, but then he stopped again. I know. Don't tell him I stopped for awhile. Then we stopped because you want it to be good Christians kind of and then we knew we were getting married and then we're going to make the wedding night special. Held off for a bit. I was mostly for guilt and fear. Probably couple of months. Six months as Christ. Did you guys have cuddle or anything? I think so. I don't hand jobs. Nothing. I don't know. I definitely gave myself plenty of.

Speaker 3:          02:31:11       I know that I got married. I remember even my father who wasn't very religious saying to me it's good to get married. Sex doesn't like you're getting away

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       with something. So there's this latent guilt, like getting away with Shit. That's part of the problem. It's so funny. I'd like you liked one of the things about married sex as opposed to single sex is like if you're just dating someone you don't know whether or not you're going to hook up like you don't know. You don't know. Are you going to come back to my place like, yeah, those are the moments I remember. By the way, am I single time and I remember the sex, but I also remember the moment where you put it out there and you were like, you want to get out of here? Or like some sort of the early days, let's go, you know, my is great. Let's go get room service or whatever it is. And then. Or when a girl says that to you out of here, I'm horny.

Speaker 2:          02:32:05       I, I remember one time I was in Montreal at the festival so I must've just gotten off stage because I just so confident and felt great and there was this girl, beautiful girl. I wanted to hook up with it and she was like, you want to get a drink? And I was like, yeah, let's go. Let's get into the room. Just immediately get crazy. Totally work, no drinks, drinks, it's some people do and some people like sex with some people. Right. But there's other people that you would have said that too and they've been like, oh, for sure. And you know, there's some people that would. Afterwards we laughed about like, who were you as like, I don't even know anymore, but as soon as I came I was like, I don't know who that guy was that got you to try on these sweatpants.

Speaker 2:          02:32:50       Yeah. Isn't that funny, man? The difference in the way the mind works when the cloud of confusion is lifted. Well that's why I'm interested in like werewolves and stuff. The stories are so compelling. I'm like, Oh yeah, because sex makes so much sense when it makes sense. Then there's other times every comedian writes the sexist, stupid bit. Like every, every comedian that I watched coming up at some point we'll have the like, what's that all about? You put your Dick in the EU because it is stupid, but something like a transformation of a werewolf happens and for some reason you can't even eat. You're just like, I have to fuck. It's a very, it's almost violating something takes over and you're like, I gotta fuck, I got to see tents now. Well, it's clearly DNA. It's clearly the need to procreate, right? It's a biological trick.

Speaker 2:          02:33:37       What a betrayal. The urgency of trying to create, trying to read a book and it's like ass, but it's also enjoyable. So it's like you got to revel in the enjoyable aspects of it. I mean, if, if procreation was just simply this like weird sort of pragmatic choice that you made. Well we're running out of people. We definitely have to procreate. All right, let's plan accordingly and set up a nursery. Okay. And then what are we going to do? It's wonderful. It's a fun game to be stuck in the game. I remember that when I, when I was single and I would hit on people or whatever, I would sometimes have to remind myself like, you love sex, like I would have to [inaudible] you're going out and you're like, I didn't want to go out and talk to the. And you'd be like, like I could hear my being like, trust

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       me, I'm doing this for us. To really be happy once when it's actually happening and then I'd be in the bathroom like he was right? Yeah. Son of a bitch. Yeah. But which is the saddest thing when relationships deteriorate to that sort of maintenance sex place where they're just like that. That's a lot. Like a buddy of mine just got divorced and uh, I was talking about, he goes, just, we got to this point where it's just like maintenance x date night, I guess we should do it now. And it was just interested because there is, I've heard people that swear by that sort of thing, even though it's completely dispassionate and it's not romantic at all, but they're like, you have to keep fucking. Even if it does seem routine because it keeps you connected. Like spirituality, get it out of the way when you're fucking.

Speaker 1:          02:35:04       Like, I knew a guy who was about to get divorced and he was like, please, we just need to have sex. Like I know we don't really like each other right now, but just let, let, let's do it to see if it. Because you have sex with somebody. I would have sex with somebody that I had just met and after you have sex you just, you just kinda like, oh, woke to the potential of how great they might be. You know, you're just like, oh my God, I feel so close. Well, there's definitely some strange and it was a communication through sensuality, right? This is like touching and kissing and licking and fun and just all that stuff like con contributes to the, your appreciation of the person you're bonding and some strange way, which is why people get so angry when you break up because it's like you're taking away like a piece of them, like they've invested in you and they like their, their, their roots of like connected to you.

Speaker 1:          02:35:55       Have you seen vanilla sky? Remember that movie? I don't remember it though. Some time ago is driving a car and she's breaking. Tom Cruise is breaking up with her, so real nightmare. She starts driving really, really fast. They ended up crashing into off a bridge and that's why I asked to wear that mask, the whole moving. Anyway, so she's mad at him for breaking up with her and she goes, it's such as the perfect horror movie moment. She goes, I swallowed. You come. And it's just film version of exactly what you're talking about. Like there's a bond. Even if it's casual, there's something going on where it's Kinda like, hey, fuck you man. In that magical place together, you're going to act like that was nothing. I don't think sex is nothing. I've had casual sex. I've enjoyed casual sex. I think people should have casual sex, but their Qa, I believe people when they're like, hey, that meant more to me than it did to you male or female.

Speaker 1:          02:36:45       Well, there's also this thing where people were rejected where it hurts, it hurts really bad. Like being rejected her. It's like one of the things that, um, I remember I had this friend and uh, I was stopped being friends with him because he would get real upset when women would turn them down and he, it was, it was, it was hurting him because he wasn't an attractive guy and he was kind of awkward and he would try to hit on girls and it wasn't working and when it wasn't working he would get angry and I saw him deteriorate psychologically over the years because like he didn't have a girl,

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       he had one girlfriend, she fucked around, Ahm. And then he just didn't. He just dated for awhile and then he became more and more bitter. And what was going on was this, he was associating women with rejection and with that bad feeling of just being turned down and despised like you that like, oh, that devastating feelings to him was his connection with women. I think this is why we see a lot of degradation and straight up aggression in pornography for sure. Mad At holding women. It's kind of the grownup version of your mother's tit going dry. I'm not even trying to be frank, I know what you're saying. Colicky baby. When I was single, I remember very vividly because it scared the hell out of me to be honest. And this is kind of vulnerable, but you gotta have good audience. Uh, I remember I was, I was actually, it was weird.

Speaker 3:          02:38:08       I was with two girls and I was trying to make that happen and it didn't. And I got in the elevator and I felt like a colicky baby, like a teething baby. I didn't do anything right. But if I had, if I didn't have the self restraint, I would've, I would've been like, wow. I just felt like, how can you not pick me up? Right, right. Put all this. You feel like it's owed you. You're like getting all those drinks. And I was so charming. And you feel like a kid that got yanked from love. Well, there's also the thing that we were talking about, like when the Werewolf kicks in and you want to fuck so bad and you know, that it could possibly happen. So there's this moment where you're like, just to where we'll get to come out as you get to come out and they're like, you know, and also will you love the like I need you.

Speaker 3:          02:38:55       That's another thing that's happening in sex, right? Is someone saying, I see your animal side and I celebrate it. That's the opposite of a nun slapping you with how bad boyfriend they want you to feel pleasure. They want you to come out and be yourself. That's how at the moon together, like you said, carnal, carnal, and it's beautiful and you're there and if you have added three way and the more the merrier. There's witnesses, there's like a notary fucking and there's someone else kind like this is amazing. You know what I'm saying? That's healing. Talk about the other thing, like I remember pornography. I think guys and maybe women to have a certain shame associated with just the functionality or like why do we love Dick Jokes? We love them. They kill. We don't talk about it so weird that our whole species runs off of these fucking little tubes that fill with blood and common jet out from your body, like a diving board for a mouse and look and when you're watching porn, girls are just like so excited.

Speaker 3:          02:39:59       So into it. It's all an act, I, I'm assuming, but that's why it's like I read this book called pornified and they were like, men have ejaculation. Shame because anytime anything comes out of your body, it's kind of gross. You're just like shit or snide and your Dick Sneezes. This. Where does this theory come from? Ejaculation. Shame. I don't know. I'm sure it was in the footnotes, but I just remember that she mentioned it and I was calling like, that seems to make sense to me and that's why you have girls. I'm not even trying to be funny. Guzzling come drinking, come face comes. Oh, come on. My faith. I think it's solving takeaway. Even if it's just ejaculations, it's something going, I know you're a wild animal and I accept you. You know what I'm saying? Well, I'm the opposite of grossed out. I'm turned on by it by what?

Speaker 3:          02:40:44       But you know what I'm saying, like woman. Yeah. I wonder if it's the same if you don't know. I can't think of a female equivalent, but like if you have, if you don't care that your girls under her period or whatever and you love them, not in spite of that, you love them through that. I think that's also kind of in the ballpark of like, dude, I get it. We're stuck in these things, these weird space suits that have these shit comes out of here and he blood comes out of here. Okay, all alright, let's dance. But at the end of it, there's something going on somewhere, whether it's between your eyes or somewhere where consciousness resides and that consciousness is also trapped in these, these desires and these, these biological needs. Yeah. That's, that's, that's where Rhonda is really helps me. Where it was like, you just try and watch it unfolding you.

Speaker 3:          02:41:32       You're, you're the witness. You know what it's like to step into the witness and your tanks or however it is and you're like, when I go, I'm horny. It's really the witness going, Oh shit, we're getting the horny signal. Yeah. I always thought that was my brain, but I'm like, there's something watching the brain and interpreting it and the more I can be in that kind of the yogis call it like the unflattering candle. Like you keep your consciousness still even in the middle of a heated argument or in the middle of some serious fucking. You're still kind of in the back watching it like television, like Holy Shit. Like Ram Dass says, great thing. I think this is helpful. It helps me. If you're anxious or depressed, you go like, who's noticing the depression? And you try and sit in there and you go, there's depression. Holy Shit. I wonder if I'm going to make it through this.

Speaker 3:          02:42:19       This is some fucking heavy shit. But if you're there, like, did you read, uh, the power now? It was a totally, totally. Um, I listen to it on tape. Yeah, it's better on days. He has that great point where he's depressed. He's, he's thinking about killing himself and he has this thought where he goes, I can't live with myself. And he's like, who is the, I can't live with myself. Who's the eye watching the myself? And then he slipped into that dude becomes like, I don't know if he's enlightened or what, but he's got some dope ass shit. They say he does. So do you beat home? I didn't mean to go on a tear. That was great, man. That's a good way to end this thing, man. We just did three hours. We did not. Yeah, it's 2:00. You can read this clock. That clock right there. I've double up on clocks are clocks everywhere in this place. Back there. I got to say I'm so honored. I'm a fan obviously too, was just fine. It meant a lot. I really appreciate it. I really enjoyed our conversation.

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       It was really cool. We kept other. I also want to get it. This is the hemp oil, but is it maybe I told you about. It's called Charlotte's web. Oh cool. It's like it's cbd without thc. Oh Great. So it's not psychoactive. Oh Man. You know. Uh, I know a lot of people that live off this stuff body. I take it. Here's the great thing, you can read on it, you can do sets on it, write on it. It's completely functional, but there's just a whisper of like, I'm good. Like you're a little bit. You have a glow. You're a little bit quicker to laugh. Well, the anti inflammation properties of it, the anti inflammatory properties of it, I'm sure that affects just overall wellness. Yeah. Well they made it for a girl named Charlotte who was having seizures and the only thing that would help is this.

Speaker 1:          02:43:54       That's why it's called Charlotte's web. You don't want this creepy d, d, e a. we're dealing with this. I know the tyrannical organization.
