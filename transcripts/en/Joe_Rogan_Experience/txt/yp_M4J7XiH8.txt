Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello Freak bitches, and I was like, well, what is this whole fitness connection to hunting? Like why do they need to be in shape? I'm like, I'm in pretty good shape. Like what's the big deal? Well, I went with Rinella and when I went with one of the things I realized that point, I got pretty winded going up these fucking hills, hiking, hiking, tires, you out, especially high altitude and then I see your videos online and I was like, what the fuck is this guy into? And then as I go deeper and deeper into it, I realized, oh, this is like an extreme pursuit. This is not just something just go out and do. This is something that's really hard to do. And a lot of people there, I've, I've, I've read this one article, but there's one guy who was unsuccessful 12 years in a row, elk hunting for it.

Speaker 1:          00:44          Finally shot an elk like 12 years. Like how many times did this guy go out? How many days did he camped in the forest? How many days did he try to stock and get winded or snap on a twig? At the last minute or you know, the, the elk season and bolts it. Most people are unsuccessful. Yeah. I mean nine out of 10 every year. Unsuccessful. I think it's more than that for elk hunting. With archery it, it's about, it's about 10 percent. Is it 10 percent? Yeah. So nine out of 10 are unsuccessful. So people who don't hunt who see dead stuff all the time, they think, oh, you just go out and kill an Adam, right? No, right. Most 90 percent don't. It is really hard and it's just like until you're out there, you got the bone in your hand and you're trying to close in on that animal and you're trying to do everything right from a to z with.

Speaker 1:          01:35          And there's so many variables during that whole path is just like, it seems impossible sometimes, you know, even even for me after 30 years. So in a sense, psychologically when you talk about postmodernists and their rejection of these classic male structures are, what they doing is realizing that they're not going to compete in the classic as stated male hierarchy. So they're creating their own version of it. Sure. That's the creative element. Sure. While we, he, we asked earlier, what's the motivation of these pathological guys who are out there like bolstering up the feminists? Yeah. Well, you know, they don't compete any other way. They don't compete. They figured out how to compete. They compete as allies. Let's say. [inaudible] very sneaky. Yeah. Yeah. And that's how everybody always describes them to when you. I mean it's almost like a, we, I avoid doing it because it just almost feels gross to label them like that, but that's, that is the way you think of male feminists. You think of them as sneaky and it's creepy and discriminated discriminatory towards classic male behavior. Well, it, no wonder they haven't got a hope of competing in that hierarchy. Wow, that's deep. That is deep. This is going to be hurtful to a lot of people. So a lot of people listening to this right now, very upset.

Speaker 2:          03:00          You asked earlier why, why the postmodernists don't like blunt speech. That's why man, you know, it's like the truth is something that Burns, it burns off deadwood and people don't like having their dead wood burn it off often because they're like 95 percent deadwood and I'm not being an. Believe me, I'm not being snide about that. It's no joke. When you start to realize how much of what you've constructed of yourself is based on deception and lies, that is a horrifying realization and it can easily be 95 percent of you. Your things. You say things you act out, you know it's well, you see that in Pinocchio, which I often you discuss, you know Pinocchio, when he gets corrupt, as he, as he matures, he first learns to lie and then he becomes a brain jackass on pleasure island. It's like, and he's threatened by the underground authoritarians, right?

Speaker 2:          03:52          They're going to sell them to the salt mines. It's like, yeah, that's for sure. It's exactly right man. So then you figure out your uh, brain jackass and you're lying all the time. That's a terrible realization. And then all that needs to be burned away and no, people don't like that. It ties into lake a misconception, is that a natural, like a funny thing, like when I worked in the video game industry, there's a platform games, you jim from little platforms and seven times the EPA light platforms that move around and Mario type things in some video games, when you jump up on a moving platform and then jump down and fall down, you will fall down because platform moves out from underneath you. Sometimes you jump up and you move with the platform and you land on. It depends on what the program did right now a friend of mine was doing a video game and one of the programs that said, Oh, if you jump up and then jump down, the platform should have moved out from underneath you.

Speaker 2:          04:46          So you should be able to like a, you should be able to, uh, you know, this is the way we should program the physics. And then my friend Matt said, no, that's wrong. And he couldn't convince this other guy. So eventually what happened? He says, right. What we're gonna do is we're going to go out onto the road with my pickup, my pickup truck, I'm going to get in the back and you're going to drive along at 30 miles an hour and I'm going to jump straight up in the air and we'll get to see whether I land in the truck or a land on the road. So they did this experiment and the guy, the other guy who was driving the truck was totally expecting him to late jump up in that full out of the back of the truck because the truck went moved dog because he's moving the same speed as the trucks may jumps up and then he lands back in the truck and this that.

Speaker 2:          05:27          This is illustrating the video game program. I had the exact same misconception that the flat earth is due because they say, well, what if the earth is moving so fast? Why can't you just go up in a helicopter, hover a bit, wait for the Earth to move underneath you? Then go back down again. It's just, you know, it's completely backwards physics because you already moving, so you'd have to slow down to zero a which is the same as speeding up and relatively speaking. So the point is that anyone can make misconceptions about physics like that. Yeah. And it's easy to get sucked into that and it's actually quite hard to break them even flow. This is reasonable guy who was like, you know, video game program, but who presumably knew something about physics. He was convinced that Matt was going to fall out to the back of the truck and quite possibly die, but they still let him do the experiment.
