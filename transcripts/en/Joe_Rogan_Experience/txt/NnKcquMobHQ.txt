Speaker 1:          00:00:00       All Right Ladies and gentlemen, we are here and I'm here with Jocko willink of extreme ownership, how us navy seals lead and win. I'm really excited to read this because I really enjoyed your podcast with Tim Ferriss and I've seen you around the UFC a bunch of times, but uh, I didn't know much about you, but you're one of those dudes, you know where I look at this guy. I'm like, that guy probably knows some shit. This is, this says something about you, like when I see you, you know, you're hanging around with lister. I saw you a few times at the UFC in line. Like I probably know some shit or he's seen some shit and then I saw or listened to the Tim Ferriss podcast. I go, oh, okay, well that makes a lot of sense. Now if you haven't heard that podcast, it is excellent and you're the one of the first guy ever to come with your own notepad in your own pen too.

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       I just want to point that out. Just trying to be prepared. Well, that's your whole thing, man. I'm a big fan of your social media posts too because, uh, I like feeling like a lazy fuck whenever I look at your social media posts and you have a picture of your watch for 45 in the mornings. Dudes out there working out. I like it. Yeah. It's interesting because, uh, you know, obviously they had zero social media presence like three months ago or whatever the case may be. And Tim Ferriss was, you know, basically said, hey, you need to get on this social media stuff. And I said, okay, can you kind of show me what to do? And he says, yeah, sign up. So then I signed up and then he dropped that podcast that gets listened to by a bunch of people and all of a sudden I was engulfed in the social media world and I found twitter to be the one that, uh, was the easiest to use and you don't have to write a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       So, you know, I don't like people that talk a whole bunch without saying anything. So I figured that one's pretty cool. Yeah, that was the thing that I was thinking when he was encouraging you to use social media was like a guy like you, you're not a peacock, you know, and there's something about social media as a person who's an avid social media user, there's some peacocking to it, you know, and I try to do it with humor and I try to, because it's, it's an important aspect of promoting comedy shows and podcasts and things along those lines. But, um, you were much more of a, keep it to yourself. One of the things that I loved about the Ferris podcast you were talking about, um, how you would have a commanders would come to a various leaders and ask them, what do you need, what do you need a and guys would have all these requests and all these things.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       We need Wifi and we need this. And you were like, we're good sir. We're good sir. And the idea behind that is when you did need something, if you really did need something, someone would come to you, you would get it quickly. Absolutely. When I, when I needed something and I spoke up and said, hey, hey boss, this is what I need and this is why I need it. They would instantly give it to me because they knew that I was telling the truth that it wasn't some, you know, halfassed requests that wasn't real. It was something that we legit needed and they'd give it to me. Well, this is the value

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       of someone who keeps their words short and means what they say and says what they mean and doesn't have a lot of bullshit involved in their vocabulary. Or, and this is coming from a professional bullshitter. I mean, this is what I do. I bullshit. I talk, you know, fill a lot of hours of just shooting the shit about nonsense. And I mean I have to look in the mirror at myself. I mean, I just wrote with my partner Leif Babin, who I served with, you know, we just wrote a 300 page book about us, you know, for all practical purposes. Now of course it's about our team and it's about what we learned, what we experienced. But there's no doubt that there's some level of, you know, self promotion when you're writing a book that's got your name on the cover of it, and now I'm sitting here talking to you and I guess that puts me in the same league, maybe not the same league, but at least I'm playing the same sport. Yeah, we're definitely playing the same sport but that.

Speaker 1:          00:03:52       But there's benefit to that because I think what you have to say and especially what you had to say in the Tim Ferriss podcast is, is very important. It's, um, it's not just important. It's unique. And because your perspective is of one who was involved in the most intense activity, a human being can participate in today's world. You were involved in combat in Iraq during the worst time of the war and you came through it with some pretty intense lessons and you can. I think anybody listening to that podcast can get a lot out of it. There's inspiration to be gotten from that podcast for sure. But there's also an understanding that can only be. I don't think anybody else can relay what you experienced, but you, you know, you can have all these guys that write these movies and they could write screenplays and television shows about it or guys can write books about it. Embedded journalists can write about it. It's not the same. It's not the same. I got a sense from just you talking about it on Tim Ferriss' podcast. Literally a shift in my perspective of what it's like to be there.

Speaker 2:          00:05:10       Yeah, it is. For me, it was my, and I know this might sound weird, but it was my lifelong dream to be in combat and to be in a leadership position in combat. Ever since I could remember wanting to do anything of any substance with my life, I wanted to be some kind of a commando and so I really felt and the battle of Ramadi was, you know, like you said it was 2006. There was Ramadi, Iraq. It was the worst place in the world at the time and I knew that and I felt like my whole life had sort of been preparing me to be there in that position. Taking care of those guys to the best of my ability and going out and sending them out to go and kill the enemy and supporting the conventional forces that were there that were unbelievably brave and humble and just miraculously patriotic and we formed a brotherhood that, you know, to this day I don't think it'll ever be replaced and you can see why, you know, these stories of war stand the test of time and when we talk about the Peloponnesian wars, we talk about war for all time because there's, there's something there and I think it's what you began with because it is the ultimate human test.

Speaker 2:          00:06:34       You know, it's the ultimate. It is other people are trying to kill you and you're trying to kill them and that's just the ultimate test and not that it's a great test or a test that everyone should want to have happen because it's awful and horrible and wretched in many ways, but at the same time it's there and it's present and there is no avoiding it. There is no avoiding it. War is part of the world. It's part of human nature. I know Dana White says fighting's in our DNA, well you don't have to go, but one or two degrees further from fist fighting to where you know, tribes of human beings are trying to kill each other. Yeah. It's one of the subjects that have talked about with my friend Duncan. We were, we were going over this and we, we essentially came to the conclusion that the history of the human race is a history of military warfare.

Speaker 2:          00:07:30       I mean, when are you talking about the human ways race? You talk about the civil war, he talk about World War One, world war two, Korea, Vietnam. You talk about wars and in between those wars, people preparing for more war or trying to avoid war, the cold war in between wars, you know, you talk about the various conflicts throughout history, whether it's [inaudible] or whether it's Napoleon, whether you're talking about war. I mean almost all of our history has been trying to keep people from fucking with us and trying to take things that we think will help our people. That's essentially the history of the human race. Yeah, and I think what really strikes people and why there's a an almost sick fascination with it in some ways is because there it's, you know, we say that a combat is like life but amplified and intensified. So it's similar to regular life except for the consequences are obviously everything you know, you, you can die, that can be the end of you and so when you're in that moment and when you read about that and when people read these books or watch these movies, they get some sense of what that must be like.

Speaker 2:          00:08:44       And I think that's why there's, like I said, some attraction to it. I mean that's why there's hundreds and hundreds of war movies and hundreds and hundreds of war books because people try and understand what that

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       emotional content really means.

Speaker 1:          00:08:58       Well, there's no higher stakes, so anytime you're, you're involved in an activity that literally there are no higher stakes other than the loss of your loved ones and the grief that you would suffer because of that. The loss of your own life is about the highest state possible. And when I talked to people like you or many of the other guys that have talked to that have served and been involved in combat, one of the craziest aspects of it is many want to be back there. Many experience that life tuned up to 11 and they recall it like it's the best time of their life.

Speaker 3:          00:09:33       There's no doubt about it. Best time of my life, crazy, no doubt about it. Feeling that pressure, um, knowing what was at stake. And again, for me in a leadership position, you know, everyone feels a little bit different from me in a leadership position. You're not worried about yourself getting hurt or killed. You're worried about your guys getting hurt or killed. And that's the most important thing. And the thing that's keeping you awake at night and the thing that's driving you. And so there's an intensity there, but having so much pressure and so much at stake when it goes away, it's definitely leaves a hollow, empty space inside. There's no doubt about it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       Well, you see it with fighters, with boxers, MMA fighters when they retire, they have a real hard time finding regular life to be fulfilling and I can only imagine it would be way more intense because of war, because the thing about fighting is it's such a solitary sport. You know you have your team behind you, you have coaches, you have guys that you prepare with that you train with, but once you're locked up inside that cage or you step inside that ring, it's really all just about you. The experience is yours. When you're a war, you're experience is protecting all those around you as well as staying alive and losing friends and thinking that you could have done something differently and maybe someone would still be here. That's, that's a completely different kind of thing. To leave and to come back to regular civilization and then to watch all the shit that you did in Iraq go to pieces now. You watched just fucking chaos over there. Now everyday in the news that the. Whether it's the civil war between the Sunni and the Shia or whether it's what's going on with Isis and it just seems like whatever gains that you guys made there are slowly being eroded everyday. Does that also like pull at you? Oh yeah. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:11:46       absolutely. So we don't, like I said, we fought and when I say we, I'm talking about a giant group of five or 6,000 Americans with the one. One had just a huge group of awesome guys, soldiers and marines and we were a part of them and so they, they, we all fought very hard for the city of Ramadi. I mean this is, it's a city, it's a city like a city in America. It's a, you know, it's got roads and it's got houses and Scott building and it's got a government center. It's got a soccer stadium. It's a city like what we have in America. And we went in there and fought to take the city back from these savages that owned it at the time. And why do I call them savages? It's because they

Speaker 3:          00:12:31       tortured people. They skinned people alive. They beheaded people. They raped little girls and little boys. That was just disgusting and so we went in there and fought against them and beat them and what we did in doing that is the people that actually lived there. Again, this is a city with human beings in it and I always have to tell this story or at least relate to people that you'd be running down the street. There'll be and firing around you, kick open the door to a compound to somebody's house and you'd get in there and there'd be, you know, a guy, a dad working on a car and there'd be two kids kicking a soccer ball and there'll be a mom cooking lunch. And so there's people there and those people wanted us to be there and wanted us to defeat the insurgents that were terrorizing them.

Speaker 3:          00:13:23       And we did. And they were joyous about that. And so when you talk about what do I think now when I see isis, the black flag of Isis, I mean, is there any other more dramatic image? Then I can tell you then that the black flag of Isis now flies at the government center Amati. It's, it's, it's horrible and it's sickening. And they went around and anybody that had anything to do with the coalition there, they went around with a list of names and they murdered all of them and all their families and you know, we, we as a country, we kind of left them hanging and it's, it's horrible to see that

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       we left them hanging and we instigated a lot of crazy shit when we took Saddam Hussein out of power, which was probably ultimately a good thing to get rid of that guy. And it was no question that he was a psychopath and his sons were evil fucks. But in creating that vacuum, like when the leadership has gone, you, you kind of have a responsibility to manage that area. Now. As crazy as that sounds like people want to say, we're not in the building. We're not in the business of nation building. We're not, we're not in the building process or the, the, uh, the business of organizing or structuring a nation, building a democracy out of one, which did not have

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       one ever, but you kind of have to, we'll look what we did in Germany and Japan. Yeah, we're still in both those countries. We stayed there. And guess what? The two, you know, what are the two economic superpowers behind America? You know, I know those two are both in the top five. Germany is definitely the head of Europe, you know, besides China, but Japan, those are economic superpowers. They're very successful countries and we formulated their new structure. Now there's a lot of resistance in this country. There always was a lot of resistance to going to Iraq in the first place because people didn't understand the connection between nine slash 11 and Iraq and it seemed like it was manufactured. It seemed like two people on this side that, you know, we're looking at it and we're looking at Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and all these chicken hawks that wanted us to go over there and why.

Speaker 2:          00:15:41       But once you're there, you kind of have to have a different approach, don't. Yeah. Well, there's no doubt. You have to have a different approach. You have to believe in what you're doing. And again, when you're number one and, and every, every soldier or marine or service member will tell you that when they're in combat, they're not thinking about, you know, the strategic mission of the United States of America. They're thinking about the guy that's next to them and what they're going to do to keep that, keep their buddies alive. And that's, that's all there is to. And that's true in anyone will tell you that. But that being said, when you come back from that operation and you have time to think about what you're doing there, then you've got to believe in what you're doing. And if you don't believe in what you're doing, then you're going to have some serious issues.

Speaker 2:          00:16:21       And so for me, you know, it was pretty obvious that what we were doing was, was absolutely the right thing. I mean, you've got insurgents there that were foreign fighters that want to kill everyone in America. They hate us, they want to destroy us, they want to do nine slash 11 over and over again in this country. They want to kill us all and so for us to be there fighting them, I am totally on board and was on board and remain that way today. Now these insurgents that came in to these places like Ramadi and we're taking over the city and killing all these people and torturing all these people. Why were they doing that? To them it's the same. It's the same thing that isis did when they went back. I mean they want to have a chunk of land. At the time they.

Speaker 2:          00:17:09       They'd said that Ramadi was going to be the seat of their caliphate. It's going to be the capital city of their caliphate, that that's what they were trying to do. So in a sense like once war started over there, it became a holy war. Yes, and it's a holy war. But it's interesting because the people of Iraq, there's people in Iraq, most people in Iraq, when you talk to them, they're normal people that want to have a job, you know, build a new addition on their house, fixed the roof, uh, get some good food for dinner that night, raised their kids so that they can take over the family business or that's what they want. They're not a bunch of people running around doing what Isis is doing. But who is the powerful force in Iraq right now? Now everyone's scared of Isis. And, and one thing about this is there, you know, because Iraq is, they don't have this kind of patriotic feeling that we have in America, which I know, I know it may be dying in many cases, but there's a lot of Americans still believe America's the greatest country on earth and that.

Speaker 2:          00:18:20       And even if you don't believe it's greatest country on earth, and even if you see it for all its faults that it's has. You appreciate the fact that in this country you have freedom. And so you can kind of fight for that no matter what you're thinking about, you're, you're fighting for freedom, you're fighting to protect your family. Well, in Iraq, they're like, okay, um, I'll, I'll fight for whoever, I'll, I'll fight for whoever or support whoever is just gonna allow me to live the. They don't have the same attitude. That's why when Isis came into Ramadi and the, the Iraqi troops kind of ran away. They're like, well, we don't know what's going to happen. We don't really don't have that core belief that they're fighting for. And so I think that's where some of the challenges come in and as they grow that they will, they will perform better.

Speaker 2:          00:19:03       But it's definitely gonna take quite a bit of time. Well, I think patriotism in America was at its all time high around September 11th. Right? Right after that happened, you never saw more flags. I mean, I remember driving down the street and every car had a flag hanging from it. No doubt about it. I mean, it was a buddy of mine, Jay London sold flags. That's what he used to do, sell car flags, flags that you put on cars. Man, I had a good business going on for awhile, but like a lot of things, people got accustomed to it. They got it settled in and everything got back down to its normal level, so so was this big buzz of patriotism will. There's a big buzz of patriotism when you feel threatened and we never feel threatened. In America. Everyone is driving around in a nice big suv that gets eight miles to the gallon with big air conditioning blasting.

Speaker 2:          00:19:56       They're looking at their iphone, texting people socially interacting through the, through the Wifi, and they're not concerned about their safety. And so when you're not concerned about your safety, what is there left to be patriotic? When you don't understand what it means to live in fear. So yeah, September 11th comes and you get attacked and you feel that fear. Guess what? You rally around this, this thing America that's protected you and your family, but you didn't even think about it before, but now you're thinking about it and you go, you know what? I'm going to put a flag up on my up on my vehicle. This vehicle that I drive around in complete luxury, which is what America is like, America is unbelievably luxurious compared to the rest of the world. There's also unquestionable evil involved in flying planes into buildings and killing civilians just randomly, haphazardly suicide bombing essentially with a plane right into a building or a goal that was so evil that everybody just.

Speaker 2:          00:20:49       There was no. There's no gray area in that. It was pretty clear. It was about as clear as any event ever in human history. Agree. Now when you found out, I mean you already involved in the military when all this was going on you, you signed up like long before they like you. If there's anybody that I've ever met that I've ever heard, talk about it. That was. Doesn't mean this is how you feel. You're born for this. This is. This is your, your, your goal, your post in life? Yes. What put. What pulled you into them? You grew up in New England? I did what? Part of Connecticut and Maine. Okay, so it was just sticks on a dirt road, you know, just kind of a general American, general American. What was it, the true you to it? Like where did you develop this sense of patriotism?

Speaker 2:          00:21:43       Well, I would say prior to the, the feeling of patriotism, you know, I, I, like I said, I always wanted to be some kind of a commando and I would say that you, when you joined the military, I'd say people that are somewhat patriotic join the military, but when you travel around the world and you're in the military, that kind of confirms your patriotism more than anything else because you see what the rest of the world is like and how unbelievably amazing America is. And again, how does America have faults? Yeah, America's got all kinds of faults. There's all kinds of things that we could do better and there's things that we've done in the past that we shouldn't have done and there's things that we'll do in the future that we shouldn't have done, but when you compare that with the rest of the world and how the rest of the world lives and what it means to be in an oppressed society, you know, you, you're extremely thankful to be in America. This is once you've already been in the military and already started trout. So this is just, you just had this draw towards it almost like your destiny to be in the military. Yes, that's a, it's strange that it just came out of nowhere. Like there was no like event in your life. It just seemed like this was just something that it was always, you were always attracted to. I mean, running around the woods as a little kid with bb guns, shooting each other. And that seemed like a good job.

Speaker 2:          00:23:03       And it's funny. You don't seal teams, you don't, you don't grow up, you know, you don't, you continue with your childhood. Uh, you know, play time for your whole adult life and it's awesome, you know, that's the best thing about the seal teams is you, you get to do what you always wanted to do and they pay you money and you get unlimited ammunition, unbelievably types of weapons, bombs, explosives, no grenades, and they just give it all to you. And they say, well, they get excited when they find a guy like you. We've got here, we got a smart guy who was born to do this, who's really looking forward to it. It's perfect, I guess. So I'm sure the recruiter was pretty fired up when he met. I would be,

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       if I was recruited out of the way, let me sign the paper, got one check, check the boxes. And um, but it's, it's Kinda, it's even more intense because it's not just you get to play, but only the strong get to play. The week Oregon we weeded out. And what's left is people have similar character. That's what I've found most fascinating. I think that's one of the things that's so romantic in the public's eye about the idea of the seals or green berets are rangers people that it's very difficult to get in there and only a select few have the intestinal fortitude, the willpower and the ability to lock onto a task and a goal and get through it. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:24:29       and then when you're in the seal teams, none of that means anything and like all the training and all that selection process is just doesn't mean anything because you all. That's just a baseline of where everyone's at. And so when people talk about this intense training, when you're in the seal teams, you don't talk about that training that you go through to get an it. That's just the baseline for everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:24:49       So it's just to make sure that you're not a pussy just exactly. Exactly. And here you are, 44 years old. You're still getting up at 4:00 in the morning doing dead lifts. It never left you. It did not leave me. It's not going to. His aid is not going. So you get through. Once you get through the, the intensity of buds and you get through, you know, all the people that are going to quit and you get through all the training, what is life like from there on out, like how structured is like training and physical activity and things like that from there on out, you know, again, being in the seal teams is, is awesome. It's such a, such a

Speaker 3:          00:25:31       fun job that I literally didn't consider it a job except for maybe 13 months out of my career, 13 months I worked for, uh, the directly for the animal that was in charge of all the seals and it, he's a great guy and I learned a ton from him and from having that job, but it wasn't a fun job. And even he would tell you it's not a fun job. You know, you've got to uh, you know, you're wearing a uniform every day and in the regular seal teams you're, you're wearing a pair of shorts and you're barely wearing a shirt because you're out there in the field or you know, getting ready to go in the field. So it's a, it's a great life and you're constantly training, you're hanging out with a bunch of guys that are pretty much have the same attitude as you for the most part.

Speaker 3:          00:26:13       There's a couple guys that don't cut it and there's some guys that are super studs and you're, you're doing your best to emulate them, but you're hanging out with a bunch of great guys. And you know, when I was a young seal, well we'd get to Friday and we'd, you know, go out, have a beer, we'd get done Saturday, we'd still go to work Sunday, we'd still go to work, we go work out, we'd hang out, we'd work on our gear, we'd get ready and there was even not even a war going on. We were just into it, you know, we were just fired up for the seal teams and that was so it's, it's a great life. And then once the war

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       started, the intensity definitely picked up because you know, everybody knew that we were going into combat and everyone pushed that much harder. That being said, back in the nineties, we used to train really, really hard because it was an unknown element, you know, there was an unknown element where you didn't know what was really going to. You didn't know what combat was really like. So you trained as hard as you possibly could. Figure out how to train. We trained and then once combat started and we were like, okay, well we kind of know what we're dealing with now. It'd be like a fight or go into a camp if he's never fought in the UFC before, he's going to train super hard to make his debut. Well, maybe after he wins really easily as first couple of fights, maybe he backs off on that train and capital.

Speaker 2:          00:27:25       Not that we did that, but it definitely mentally was there, uh, to, to push hard even before combat. So you just essentially saying that even before you were going to war, you were gonna be ready. You, you were, you were going to make sure that you had all your boxes checked, you get all your ducks in a row, 100 percent. How much physical training is there? Once you're actually deployed it, it depends on where you are and what you're doing, you know, it depends on what type of missions you're going on, but you know, being in the seal teams is a very physical job and again, you know what it is, it's a baseline. Everyone expects it. You're gonna be able to put on your rucksack and your gear and go out and move and shoot and communicate. That's the baseline. Everyone's expected to do it and whatever you have to do to make that happen is, is kind of on you.

Speaker 2:          00:28:11       Although we do do, you know team, what we call pt, physical training, but we do team pet, but a lot of it is on you as an individual or your smaller element, you know, group of guys and that's how you, you to, you got to stay in shape. You do not want to be the guy that can't carry as can't carry his weight. That's just, you'll, you'll get, you'll get kicked out. So it's. But it's not structured. It's not organized like say if you're deployed in Iraq. What I was getting at was I always wondered, like I would imagine that the type of workouts that you do, they're exhausting, right? You know, you're dead lifting, you doing cleans and presses and all this crazy shit and chin ups and running up hills. If you had to go to war, right after a hard workout like that, it's going to take something out of you.

Speaker 2:          00:28:52       Yeah. You've gotta use you gotta use common sense. Right? So how do you know like when to stay in shape or what to do? Yeah, you're, you're, you're not going to do like a massive squat workout while you're on deployment. That's going to put you in there for three or four days. It's just not smart. You know, you're gonna. It's like a pavel, you know the pavel. Absolutely. Yeah. You know, he kind of. I heard that from him years and years ago, you know, because he was trained in some swat guys up in La and I talked to some of those guys and they said, you know, well, don't, you don't need to go to exhaustion to get stronger. Says, okay cool. Let's try that. And so, you know, you've got to be ready to operate, that's your primary mission. You got to be ready to go out on the battlefield and get after it so you're not going to crush yourself so hard that you're incapacitated.

Speaker 2:          00:29:39       Yeah. He's not a guy that believes in to failure. Right. He's got some interesting. He doesn't ideas and I'm not like some, uh, some follower from just one of those things I heard along the way. Yeah. I mean, look, there's a lot of different philosophies when it comes to training. Um, but when you, so when you're deployed, it's essentially all entirely on you other than the group organized pt trainings just about. Yeah, just about. So do you guys get together and say, hey, we're going to go running or we're going to live today, or we're gonna go do some pull ups. What about martial arts training? How much martial arts training is involved? Again, that depends on what the situation is and who you're working with. You know, if, if you were a junior officer that was working for me, then you are going to be trained Jujitsu all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:30:25       If they're working for you. So it depends on who they're working for. Yeah. Uh, you know, I needed training partners and so I got them. So when you did that, would you take guys and teach them some basic stuff and then just choked the shit out of him? Is that the move? Pretty much. Pretty much. Do you talk them through it while you're doing it? Like defend, get your arm here. But, you know, I actually, I would actually improve, you know, I'd go on deployment and come back and you know, some guy that maybe I was having good battles with before I left to come back and be better because all of a sudden you go and work on really good offense against a bunch of strong, you know, psycho seals that don't want to tap and you've got to make it work. So, you know, I'd come back and, and be better.

Speaker 2:          00:31:07       I wouldn't, I wouldn't get worse on deployment. That's for sure. Was that Sadie Bravo's theory? He believed that the real way to get better is not to train with people better than you, but to train with people that aren't as good as you and just constantly drill finishes over and over and over again, sharpen them up like a Samurai sword, and then when you do spar with people that are your level or better, you'll be much better just because you're constantly used to finishing. Yeah, and I think there's a combination of both. You've got to train with people that are better than you and you got to train with people that are worse than you and you know, we do that in seal training to where because the seal training that I ran before I got out was not like the seal training where you see with the guys with the the logs carrying those around or boats on the head that like I said, that's the basic training in and no one really cares too much about that.

Speaker 2:          00:31:52       Once you get in the seal teams because it's just over, it's just a smash you in the beginning smash. You make sure, like you said, make sure that you. You're not opposed to exactly have the intestinal fortitude to bring it, but once you get in the seal teams, then you go through something called a workup and that's when you've got seal platoons that are trying to work together and we do crazy simulated combat on these guys. That is awesome. I mean, it's, it's devastating. And we have a paint ball. Again, this is like little kid stuff, right? You get, you get awesome. Paintball, guns, unlimited paintball rounds. We had this, this, uh, like the best laser tag system that anyone could ever imagine. This crazy expensive laser tag system where you could go out and fight each other with laser tag and when you were getting at, if the

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       rounds weren't theoretically hitting you, then there was a little speaker on your shoulder that would make noises as if rounds. We're going over your head so that you would know to get down and there'd be explosions going off on these little speakers. And then when you get back from these training operations, the, all the, they have little embedded gpss in them. So you'd put it out on Google earth and you could watch the whole battle unfold and watch what people did right and wrong. And my point in this is that sometimes many times, especially in the beginning when the seals weren't quite up to speed yet and they didn't know how to work together that well, three or four or five opposing for seal. So these are guys that are pretending to be bad guys. They would kill them all. They would just go out there and murder them all.

Speaker 3:          00:33:21       And as these guys got better and started to work together and the leadership started to step up and take command and, and do a better job of leading, then all of a sudden they, the seals would start to beat the opposing force and annihilate them. What an incredible tool to learn how to organize and to, to stay together and work together as a team. What did they used to do in the past? Well that's, that's a very interesting topic because it's very similar to, you know, what the UFC did to martial arts because you know, as you know, in 1991, you know, you and I could sit here and talk it, you could be a Kung Fu guy and I could be an Aikido guy and we could be like, no, my martial arts better and you can be saying the same thing and we could theoretically debated all day long but we'd never actually do it.

Speaker 3:          00:34:06       And it's different. So in combat, obviously you can't, you know, we can't say, okay, let's find out which one's better and we're on the same team, we're just going to kill each other to find out you can't do that. So the first thing that happened was simunition and that's, you know, they basically started paintball but it's high speed paintball that fits in your real gun fits in a real, a real gun. So you take your, you put a new barrel on your, your standard, you know, issue weapon and now you're shooting paint balls out of your real gun. You have 30 rounds. He changed magazines like very, very similar to real combat and all of a sudden just like a punching bag, you know, when people say, oh, the punching bag doesn't punch back what? When you go into a, into a house and you shoot a bunch of paper targets, they don't move, they don't shoot back.

Speaker 3:          00:34:46       So it's, you know, guess what, you win every single time and you can get pretty confident with your tactics. Your tactics aren't getting tested. And so when, when these great technologies come came out, ammunition, paint ball and these laser type systems, it was a, it was a complete change and we definitely changed our tactics. Our tactics evolved, just like fight tactics evolved with the, with the advent of the UFC. And people said, oh, this doesn't work the way we thought it did. And you know, this idea of, oh, we're just going to go running into a room and no one's going to stop no matter what. No, actually if there's a machine gun just lay in paint into you as you go in, you're stupid if you go running into that room. So we made these simple adjustments but it was an interesting progression and it definitely imprinted the fact that you have to make your training as realistic as possible.

Speaker 3:          00:35:29       And it also, it also shows you how people, humans have a tendency to believe in what they're doing just because it's kind of what they believe in. And you know, again, I think those, those traditional martial arts that were so popular back in the day, people truly believed that like, no, I will actually stop you with, you know, with my ci, my Ci will stop you. And they, they really thought that I had one of my Jujitsu buddies was, you know, had some ci guy in 1995, like, you cannot take me down. And he said, well, what do you mean? And he said, no, I, once I settle my ci, you cannot take me down. And he said, well, okay, settle your, do you want to try it? And the guy's like, sure, you can try all you want. So the guy you know, stands there and settles, is she out? And my buddy goes, are you ready? And he says, yeah. And he just like double legs and slammed him on the ground, but the guy believed it. That's what's crazy. And that's what, that's what people get get lured into, you know, the, our egos listen into a lot of stuff that we need to watch out for. Well

Speaker 1:          00:36:30       the belief is based on being taught by people who also believe it too. And it's so confusing because no one's experienced it in, in real life, which was why the initial question was when they used to prepare like back in Vietnam or you know, during the, uh, the, well, when was this stuff invented? Like we did, they had it during the first Gulf War.

Speaker 3:          00:36:54       Barely, barely. Very small groups had it, you know, not, not as many as should they have the laser setup and everything. No, we didn't get the good. No, they had that. They had a worse laser system. You know, they've been trying to do it for years, but what did they used to do like during the Vietnam era, go off of the experience of guys that had been in world war two and Korea to try and pass that on. And Luckily, and honestly, you know, being in combat, the basic principles of combat are not the super crazy complex things, you know, the most basic principle that we talk about is cover and move, which is if you and I are going to go assault a building over there, I'm going to, I'm going to take cover. I'm going to engage that building so that the enemy can't put their heads up and while I'm shooting at the building, shooting where we think the enemy are, you're going to get up and maneuver into a better position.

Speaker 3:          00:37:45       Once you get into a better position and you get some cover, you're going to start shooting at the enemy and that's going to allow me to move. Once I get to a better position, I'll start shooting again and we'll continue to do that. Supporting each other as we move to retarget. And then once we get there, we'll kill the bad guys and there'll be, it'll be done. That's the most basic principle. But there's times where before, you know, in between Vietnam, which is where we had major combat and people learned that cover moving guys that were in Vietnam were the people that taught me covering move in between that time and the time when we started using this ammunition and the and the lasers, the better products. We actually forgot some of those lessons. As crazy as that might seem. We actually forgot some of these very simple basic lessons of, of gun fighting. And so it was great to have it back and it was when we were, when we went to combat finally, we were more prepared for

Speaker 1:          00:38:35       it. Yeah, I would imagine that kind of simulation you, you're calling it simunition. That's a, that's an actual name brand. And it's a name brand it, that's the paint. Yep. So send me an issue is the paint and the laser. What is the name brand of that stuff?

Speaker 3:          00:38:50       One that we used was called debts and it was made by sob and I don't know, I don't, I don't even know if they still make it or if that contracts don't go in, but it was awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:38:59       Yeah, I like your analogy to martial arts, like testing it in, in the, in the actual competition because it would seem that that would be the only way that anybody would ever actually learn what mistakes not to make and how they could easily be replicated in combat and then the repeated actions of doing those over and over again and ingraining them in your mind is probably the only thing that could really, you could draw upon when you're in those intense situations of an actual firefighter.

Speaker 3:          00:39:29       Yeah, and there's another good comparison. I don't know if you've ever heard somebody say this, but you know, they'll say like, let's say I train some Kung Fu stuff where I'm and I attacker and I rip your throat out and all that stuff and you train, you know, Jujitsu, Muay Thai, wrestling and boxing. Right? So people will say that you're not ready for the fact that I'm going to poke your eyes out or you're not ready for the fact that I'm going to try and grab your throat or whatever and therefore I have an advantage and a and that you have some kind of a training scar because you aren't used to doing that. You see what I'm saying? So if like I said, if all I do is train to grab your eyes and poke your throat or whatever pressure point type attack, then that means that I'm better prepared for a street conflict.

Speaker 3:          00:40:19       And as you and I both know, like a guy that does that versus a guy that trains in mixed martial arts, boxing, wrestling, Moitai, Jujitsu, that guy's going to destroy this other person in the street fight and the guy will grab for Xyz and then he's gonna get his arm broken off and is going to get punched in at 47 times. But my point in telling them that that is that this. We had the same type of people in inside the seal teams that said, Oh, if you get used to training with paint ball, then you're going to develop training scars from it so you're not going to be used to your regular weapon. You're not going to be used to the recoil of a real gun and you're going to have more courage because it's only going against paint and wall. That while there's some small piece of truth to that, just like there's some small piece of the truth to the fact that if, if you never think about what it's like to be punched while you're doing Jujitsu, well then it's going to be a surprise for you.

Speaker 3:          00:41:15       The first time you you are in guard with someone and they crack you in the face. There. Some small truth who, but it's not a reason to throw out, you know, that type of training. It just doesn't make sense. And the other thing that's good about it is, you know, in Jujitsu and boxing and wrestling, you're going live against another human being that's a maneuvering on you and trying to defeat you. And when you have paint ball or laser, you're going against another human being that's trying to maneuver on you and defeat you. So therefore it's very effective in teaching and what real combat is going to be like. What was it like the first time you were deployed and when was that? The first time I was deployed in 2003 and deployed to Baghdad, Iraq. And it was great.

Speaker 3:          00:41:59       That's not what most people would think of. It wouldn't never think of that word. It's very it. What was interesting about my first deployment to Iraq was that again, I was so happy to be in a position where I was a platoon commander and we were doing real missions and I was excited and happy about that. And you know, that doesn't mean I was running around smile on my face and we had a legit job and we had to get it done. It was also a time where the, the insurgents, there wasn't an insurgency yet. We hadn't even really heard that word in 2003. And so the operations that we did were relatively simple and our tactical advantage over the enemy was good enough that we just annihilated them, you know, it was like, it was like an unfair fight, which is how you want it to be.

Speaker 3:          00:42:55       You want to have an unfair fight in combat. And so we would go in, you know, 2:00 in the morning, we'd find out what a bad guy was in some house or some officer, some building, and we'd load up our vehicles and go in the middle of the night, blast their door open with big explosive breaching charge, clear their house in about 30 seconds, grab them, grab their buddies, bring them all back, interrogate them, find out where their friends are and go out and do it again. And it was awesome and it was awesome. And it was like a rockstar deployment. We'd come home at 3:00 in the morning and be done and debrief the operation and get ready to do it the next day. We probably were in four or five firefights during that whole deployment. Couple ambushes and I had one guy get, get wounded, not very bad. So it was, it was, it was funny, it was good and we were ready for it. Um, and the contrast comes when you go to my next deployment, the next deployment to Ramadi, which was completely different. So and on that deployment, everything bad that can happen too.

Speaker 3:          00:44:15       A guy in a leadership position or an element happened to us, everything bad that could happen, happened. And so it was, it was radically different than my first deployment. So your first deployment was a in a sense a like what people

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       expected the war to go, like after we had experienced Desert Storm, Desert Storm, which was just an overwhelming success. Just the only casualties were when that one Scud missile had hid a barracks and it was just, that was what America thought war was like, well this is how good we are at it right now. We just go over there and we kill everybody and we lose a couple people. And real sad about that. But

Speaker 3:          00:44:59       we wrapped it up tight. So your second deployment,

Speaker 1:          00:45:05       what was that like and how did it begin?

Speaker 3:          00:45:10       Well, it began with our deployment orders changing, so we were literally two weeks from going on deployment. So now my first deployment to Iraq, I was what's called a platoon commander. I had 15 or 20 guys underneath me depending on what time during the deployment it was. And we were an assault force. We were like, we jokingly called ourselves Baghdad Swat because that's what we did. I just kind of describe what those missions were like. My second deployment now I was what's called a task unit commander and I had two of those seal platoons with 15 to 20 guys that were underneath me and then we had another 70, 60 or 70 support personnel. So these are people that do Intel people, that man the radios, people that clean and repair our weapons and people that keep the camera running and all that. So it's, it's, it's about 100 guys, but there's only 35 or 40 seals. And we found out about two weeks before we went on deployment, our deployment changed instead of going to Baghdad. And really doing more bag that swat operations we went, we were told we were going to Ramadi and I was again,

Speaker 3:          00:46:26       and people always say, you know, I can't believe you fought that and I can't believe how twisted you are and all, I can't believe what a sick individual you are and et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. But yes, I was extremely happy and motivated that we're going to Ramadi because it was the worst place in Iraq and that is exactly where I wanted to be my whole life. So yes, I was fired up to go there. Just so

Speaker 1:          00:46:45       crazy. I mean, it's so counterintuitive to the way most people think.

Speaker 3:          00:46:51       I guess so. And I hung around with a bunch of guys that thought the same damn thing is me. Let's go get these guys. Let's get after it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:59       Well, that's why you are who you are. I mean, that's, that's why it's important to have people like you in the world like this. Like there's a spectrum of human beings. There is a spectrum of human being and you're, you're on the extreme edge of exactly what you want. When you have an army, have you put together a military force? You want a guy like you that has that attitude. You don't want a guy who's going to the worst place in the world saying, Oh, why me? What the fuck? Why didn't I become a Baker like

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       my dad? I could be making cupcakes right now. Instead I'm shooting people. Yeah, yeah. No, you, uh, and, and, and the seal teams and the Rangers and the special forces does a very good job of attracting the type of people that you're talking about, the type of people that are fired up to do that job and not encouraging it and growing it like you did. It seems like the amount of camaraderie and the intensity of the friendships and the bond, that brotherhood that you developed with those people just intensifies it all. Yeah. It's a big gang. It's a big, it's a big awesome gang that you're a part of that's bad ass. And you're part of this fraternity is brotherhood. So yeah, they definitely fuel the fire and, and I should say, I shouldn't say they fuel the fire, we fueled the fire. We're, we are the fire, you know, the guys that are there, the guys that I worked with, they're fired up guys that are completely ready to do this job.

Speaker 2:          00:48:33       So you get over there, you're in Ramadi, totally different situation than banked at totally different situation in Baghdad. And he immediately realizes immediately, immediately we were going. I mean I think, I think we went to the first memorial service for an American within, you know, 24 hours of being on the ground there. We, my, my, my camp got attacked the, I dunno, maybe the third or fourth night that we were there, every guy was on the roof of our building, shooting back at bad guys that were shooting at us. It was. And then, and then we started conducting operations almost immediately. And the operations were just, just radically different. I mean the enemy owned the downtown area from Audi. They, they were the dominant force down there. So whereas before you'd be going through kind of semi permissive environment in Baghdad, meaning that, you know, it's a, it's a bunch of civilians and they just wanted to get out of your way and then you'd go and find this bad guy, well in Ramadi, the bad guys, we're going to find you. And it was different and they were everywhere. They were who had trained them.

Speaker 2:          00:49:49       Some of them were former regime elements, so some of them were. Ramadi was a, was an Iraqi military city as well. So there's some of them leftover, actually a bunch of them leftover. And then you had Syrians coming in, foreign fighters, uh, people coming in from all over Saudi Arabia, Jordan, I mean, they'd come in from all over the place to come and engage and get their Jihad on. And with a motivated because America was now occupying Iraq because that, what was, was driving them, I think more than the fact that that America was occupying Iraq, is that they wanted to take that land. I mean, America was no longer occupying Iraq when they went in and took Ramadi this time. We were going, we'd been gone for four years, so the occupation of Iraq was not the driving force behind this. So once you get there, once you realize right away, it's different.

Speaker 2:          00:50:39       You're experiencing casualties at a level that was unheard of in Baghdad and you are engaging with an enemy that's very prepared and overwhelming. They're everywhere. And they did. They were similar to us, meaning they did like a first world country type stuff. They had met a medical evacuation. Plans are one of their guys would get wounded. You'd see them get evacuated, you know, you could watch on, on the screens, you could watch what was happening. A vehicle would come in and gathered them up and take one of the guys away. They'd bring in reinforcements. They had communications, they did fire maneuver. They did the same basic tactics that I was talking about. They did those tactics as well. And so it was a real well trained and well coordinated and determined enemy. Was this expected? Well, we knew what Ramadi was like. Um, but I would say it was expected, but it's hard to mentally picture what that's going to be like when you, when you're going to go up against guys that are that prepared.

Speaker 2:          00:51:46       So this was tactically and as far as like the strategy that was involved to try to take a city like that. This was a fairly new experience for the United States military, right? We, we'd never had what other being other what Somalia, like what other urban war had a, the United States engaged in like this where you're in a city. Well, I mean obviously World War Two had all kinds of conflict and in Vietnam there was portions, you know, the battle of waste, waste city was a huge urban conflict. Somalia was definitely urban combat, but you're right in the fact that we weren't going in there to try and stay. And that was one of the biggest differences or changes in strategies that the US military had that turned the war around. And that was as the, as the insurgence grew and it's 2004, 2005, the insurgency started getting more and more unified and better and more well trained and more organized and America. What we did was kind of go back to our strong basis. So there's basis. You got to understand this in Iraq, 2005, 2006, if you went to a base in let's say Baghdad International Airport, there was a huge US military base. There was a subway, the sandwich shop, subway, starbucks. These places have become little little outcroppings of America. And so what we did when the insurgency got worse and worse and worse, and also the public opinion of the war went down and down and, and all of a sudden we're sitting here going,

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       wow, we're not going to want to minimize casualties as much as possible. So what does that mean? You do? You go back to your base. And we, we did that as a country. We kind of said, okay, we're not going to take huge risks anymore. We're going to pull back to our basis. We're going to try and support the Iraqis as much as we can and let them go out and try and accomplish missions and we still did do missions, but we definitely had strong and move back to these big basis.

Speaker 3:          00:53:55       There was a guy a there. There were several people and one of them was general Patraeus. He wrote this, you know the counterinsurgency manual now. Now. Now what you had was you went from this idea of we're fighting kind of terrorists and all of a sudden you're fighting an organized insurgency, and that was a huge strategy, strategic shift, and so now instead of going out and grabbing a bad guy and then coming back the the, the new strategy, and it was implemented in Ramadi by a guy named Colonel Sean Mcfarland was c's clear hold and build, which means you're going to go into these enemy controlled neighborhoods. You're going to take buildings, you're going to hold those buildings. You're going to build them into your own fortes and you're going to have American and Iraqi soldiers live in those enemy controlled territory's until the enemy was gone.

Speaker 3:          00:54:39       Had that ever been implemented before? It had been implemented in [inaudible] in northern Iraq by a guy named h Dot h Dot r dot mcmaster was another kind of legendary, a military army colonel at the time. All these guys are generals now because they're awesome guys. He'd implemented up there. He actually turned that plan over. Two Gentlemen, Farlane and gentlemen. Foreman came down to Ramadi and implemented the plan there, but what was, what was hard to understand is no one really knew about this. No one understood it all. They all they said was, oh my God, wait a second. You're saying we're going to go into these enemy controlled neighborhoods where were there haven't been American or coalition forces for a year, year and a half, two years. You're saying we're going to go in there. Right before we arrived in Ramadi, there was a road that the marine corps tried to penetrate down.

Speaker 3:          00:55:29       They hit 13 ids and 500 meters, so 1330 $500. So essentially what is 500 meters is like, it's every 50 meters or so, a little less than 50 meters. What does that football fields, how much I foot five football fields. Yeah, that's insane. That is. Wow. So, so this new strategy to go in there and pushing there was considered to be by many people was considered to be too risky, too dangerous and, and really in some cases crazy. Like this is a crazy strategy. We haven't been able to get down there and now you're saying we're gonna go down there and live there. So it was a, it was a very dynamic change. So this is a gigantic, gritty boots on the ground approach to taking over a city, like one step at a time, but one building at a time. That's it. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:56:25       That had to be insane. Yeah. Yeah. Is there any documentary footage of this? Were there any embedded journalists embedded journalists? You know, you can go on youtube and just Google Ramadi, 2006 and you'll, you'll see some good stuff. There is a documentary that came out, I think it was on the history channel. It's called a chance in hell, the battle for Ramadi and that. What's good about that one is it interviews. A lot of guys that we worked with while we were there and what I was just trying to convey to you about the fact that a lot of people were saying this was a suicidal operation. You can hear these guys that were officers in charge of battalions and companies. They're saying the same thing there. They were getting told by their peers like, this is a crazy idea and you guys are all going to die if you go in there.

Speaker 2:          00:57:11       Wow. Now what is morale like when something like that gets brought down, when these are the orders and this is what you have to do and everyone's telling you it's a suicide mission. Well that's, that's where leadership comes in because you know, one of the, one of the toughest things that I ever had to convey to my guys was this fact that we were going to be working alongside Iraqi soldiers, conventional Iraqi soldier. So you picture this. We have that first appointment I talked about. We were, we were only working with seals, seals. The guy to your left was a sealed. The guy to your right was the CEO. The guy behind you as a seal, the guy who you can trust and who you can trust them, you knew them. They were, they were your brothers. So now we get to Ramadi, and the mission changed coming down from the special operations forces that were in charge of, of all special operations in Iraq, and the new, the new mission was to the new mission.

Speaker 2:          00:58:11       I'm trying to think of the exact, uh, was to train and fight company and platoon sized elements of Iraqi soldiers. Train and fight company, platoon size elements of Iraqi soldiers. And when they say fight, that means like that's a verb saying we're going to fight with them. So all of a sudden I'm telling my guys, hey, you know how you're used to working with a bunch of seals. You're going to. Now when you go out, the majority of the guys, you're going to be with our Iraqi soldiers. That's the majority of guys now Iraqi soldiers are, they're, they're, they're, they're barely even military. I mean people. They're just unmotivated, poorly trained. In fact, in many cases their loyalty is questionable. I mean, these are guys that would shoot Americans in the back. So now I'm telling my guys, okay, you're gonna, go out there and do this. And obviously the first reaction I got was a, this is, this is crap, this garbage. Why would we ever do that? This is the worst battlefield seals have fought on since Vietnam. And you want us to go out there with a bunch of a bunch of Iraqi soldiers watching our back. That's crazy. And, and when I heard it, I thought it was crazy too.

Speaker 2:          00:59:26       So what do you do? Then what? What do you do? Then you're going to send your guys into harm's way in a much more vulnerable way and you got to get them to do it. So first of all, I had to understand what we're doing on, in my own mind. I had to understand why. I understand, why would somebody be telling us to do this? Because it seems freaking crazy to me. So as I sat there and thought about it, I realized, you know, okay, why is, why is the president making us do this? Why is the general the, why is the Pentagon making us do this? Why are the generals and colonels on the battlefield here in Iraq? Why in God's name would they be making us go out with Iraqi soldiers? It's crazy, and then I thought to myself, well, okay, why? Let's answer that question.

Speaker 2:          01:00:12       Oh, news flash, if we don't do it, if we don't get the Iraqi soldiers trained up and ready to maintain the security in their own country than who's going to do it, who's going to do it? Who's going to train them? And furthermore, who's gonna hold the security and our country? And the answer was nobody in the answer was us. The answer was we would be here forever because these Iraqis need to be able to get up and stand on their own two feet. And so when I explained that to my guys like, Hey, I know you don't want to work with Iraqi soldiers. I understand. I understand there's more risk. Here's why we're doing it. We're doing it because if we don't do it, if we don't get these guys up to speed, if we don't teach them how to defend themselves and how to defeat this enemy, they're never going to be able to do it and we'll be mired in this conflict forever.

Speaker 2:          01:00:58       And once, once they understood that strategic picture, they were able to get their head around it and then slowly accepted what we were doing. How common were there complications from dealing with the Iraqi soldiers and did you guys have to take steps in order to, to watch over them to make sure when you're talking about guys shooting guys in the back shooting Americans in the back, did you have plans in place to make sure that someone was watching them at all times? Yeah. Yeah. So you didn't, you couldn't treat them like, did some, did they speak English? Uh, no. We had interpreters and oh yeah, it's a nightmare. Um, and, and, and we would have some of the Iraqi soldiers, some of them, some of the leadership of the Iraqi soldiers would be very good. Some of the grunts would be very good. And someone will just disastrous. And did we have to change? Yeah, they didn't. We had to change our tactics so that we didn't use the terms left and right because they didn't understand left and right or no numbers. A lot of them couldn't count. I mean, it was. They couldn't count. Yeah. Yeah. So they're totally on educated, totally uneducated. Wow. Can't count. Holy Shit. Go four doors down. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:02:12       something you can tell a five year old. Yes. Whoa. Yeah. So, so that was, that was definitely challenging. I think allowed to call them savages when they can't count. Is that, is that the rule? If you don't count the four I reserve, I reserve the term savage for somebody that carb commits, you know, atrocities against human beings. You know, somebody that rapes an eight year old girl, like they're doing wholesale doing that. And Isis is doing that right now. That's part of their gig. Uh, yeah. I, I, I reserve the term savages for them. So what steps did you guys have to take to ensure that the seals and the other American soldiers were protected in working with these people? I mean, you just have to keep your eye on him. I mean, and honestly at this point, the, you saw this, this, uh, happen a lot more than Afghanistan, which was the, what do they call it, the color,

Speaker 2:          01:03:08       I forget what they, they have a term for it, but when the, when the friendly allegedly friendly Afghan soldier turns in, shoots everyone in the back that happened more later in Afghanistan and when we were in Iraq it was pretty seldom that it happened, but we just had to be aware of it and we had to, you know, you always had a guy that was standing off the firing line and making sure that no one was, you know, pulling their weapon out and aiming at Americans. So that was a job. Yeah. I would just, you gotta keep an eye on these guys. You absolutely crazy added element and the other, I mean it just again, because there's dichotomy and everything at the same time, you'd have some guy that was, you know, some Iraqi soldier that was willing to take a bullet for your buddy.

Speaker 2:          01:03:47       And so it's, that's what makes war so complex. And confusing is it's not cut and dry and it never is. So how did it start panning out once you started this cs? Clear hold and build. It was a tough fight. Basically with every one of these combat outposts, that's what we ended up. Uh, what they ended up calling these combat outposts. Every one of them was a pretty, a pretty tough fight to the revit. Their buildings, they're calling them combat APA, combat outposts. What kind of the 10 stories, like how many stories are these buildings? Most of them were two or three stories, two or three stories. And so you set up a perimeter around the building. Key people stationed in them, guns at the windows, looking out constantly. And it would be it. We take the building down and then they would do a massive construction project in the middle of a combat zone.

Speaker 2:          01:04:36       So these army engineers, God bless them all would roll down there with their bulldozers and there they put these big concrete barriers up and they put sand bags and all the windows and they build machine gun nests on top. And again, they're doing this in the middle of like mayhem. Wow. And then you'd have this secure combat outpost and while they were doing that, this is sort of was our, our addition to this type of operation was while they were doing this big construction progress project, obviously the situation was very vulnerable for the American forces and so what we would do is I would push our seals out into perimeter buildings that were maybe 200 or 300 yards. And so when the enemy would come to attack, we'd kill them. What a crazy scene that must've been to be taking these buildings and then reinforcing them and turning them into military bases. And then one after another. You doing this to. Yeah. Yeah, it was, it was an awesome effort. And I think a good number. We put in one combat outposts and there was the, the uh, army engineers put in 30,000 sandbags in one combat outpost, like three buildings. Just all good things. A lot of sand out there. Yeah. No, no doubt about it. Wow. And so how many buildings did you guys wind up taking overall? Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:05:55       probably probably a total of like 10 combat outposts, each one having to three or four buildings. And again, let me clarify when I say we, I'm talking about this massive effort of the one one aed, which is the First Brigade, First Armored Division and all the battalions that were underneath them, including one Marine Corps Battalion. And the reason I'm pointing that out, Joe, is a, those guys were just unbelievable years. They really were. They were awesome. You choked up. Yeah, these guys were, these guys were awesome. They really were. Yeah. I can only imagine the emotional attachment that you have to that.

Speaker 2:          01:06:43       Yeah. And you know, they, you know, you can look, you can google navy seals and find, you know, $20, million new stories about them. Um, and that's great. But these guys, you know, to, to have seen them, uh, kids, you know, because, you know, you're talking about earlier how the seals, you know, guys like me, this is what we want to do. Well, these guys didn't all necessarily have that attitude. And as a matter of fact, the guys that were in Ramadi with us when we first got there, they were reserve unit out of Pennsylvania, the two to eight iron soldiers. They were reservists. These guys were teachers that like, like what you see when they talk about these reserves. These guys were teachers and professors and you know, bakers and they had real jobs and real world and wanting to get home to their family. And yet they were there grinding it out against a hardened enemy. And so, uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's a, it's a, it's a crazy thing to see and it's, it's very humbling to be around people like that. It really is. How long did this battle go on the battle for Ramada?

Speaker 2:          01:07:59       Well, we got there, you know, the, like I said, the two to eight had been there for 14 months. Fourteen months on the ground. Last around 100 guys, I think 94. Um, and then the [inaudible] came in in May and implemented c's clear hold and build in by the time, uh, when I left October 20, first 2006. And by the, by January of 2007, the battle was for most, for the most part over and these enemy attacks that had been, uh, when we were there, 30 to 50 a day, went down to like one a day and then one week and then one a month and, and, and you know, I have pictures of probably about six to nine months after we left, we got pictures that guy sent back to us. So they were running road races down the worst. What were the worst areas? Ramadi, they were playing soccer games.

Speaker 2:          01:09:00       There was people out in the streets, there was guys, seals or not seals, but soldiers with no body armor on, just walking around meeting people. It was a, it was a miraculous turnaround and the people of Ramadi that we had fought to support and help or were joyous and we're had a stable city to live in and we're ready to carry on with their lives. See, I think stories like this get left out of the mainstream narrative. Of course they do. The most people, me included, just don't know about it, aren't aware of it. Have a very insulated idea of what this war was about, what happened over there and what are the pros and cons of this war and what are the pros and cons of taking a city like this and turning it into a relatively safe place. Relatively. It was definitely a safe place.

Speaker 2:          01:09:53       There was less murders there. The nerves and Detroit. Wow. I mean it was, it was a complete turnaround and again, you do, you can do that because the people there wanted to be stable. They wanted that. They wanted peace and they wanted freedom and they wanted the insurgents out. They absolutely wanted the insurgents out. Do you think that most people in America have a distorted perception of, of the military in general and of the Iraq war in particular? I think it's hard for me to give a perspective of what civilians think, you know, it's, it's very difficult because, you know, it's really easy to slip into like just a straight John j Rambo, you know, there are no friendly civilians. It's really easy to get there. Uh, but definitely when I hear various people talking and you go, this person has no idea, this person has no idea the, it's weird because they'll clump the people of Iraq, they'll clump those people together as a group and it's the wrong.

Speaker 2:          01:10:54       They have the wrong impression of what those people are like, you know, and, and guys that have been to Iraq and have gone into houses and talk to the local populace there and broke bread with them and drank their tea. You're like, oh that these people, these people definitely wanted us there. Like when I hear this thing about, you know, that they didn't want us there and we were occupying. It's like, oh no, they, there was, there was times where the weed kill an insurgent and they would cheer. They would cheer. Like thank you, thank you for killing that person. He was a terrorist and he was, you know, trying to, trying to rape my daughter. They were happy we were there.

Speaker 2:          01:11:29       What is Ramadi like now? It's been overrun by Isis. There. They keep saying now that there's going to be an effort by the Iraqi military to take it back and God blessed them and good luck. They would have to do the exact same thing. They're going to have to do the exact same thing. It's gonna be it's gonna be tough. It's going to be really tough and without the United States military force backing them up and leading something like that, do you think that's even possible? It's going to be difficult. It is possible, but is absolutely going to be difficult. It's gonna be very difficult. That's one of the things that again, you know and leadership and leadership is such an important thing. It's such an important thing because it really does change. It changes every variable in a situation and so when you have good leaders, you you can win and I don't know who in particular is in charge of this Iraqi force that's going in there. The Iraqis have some very strong leadership and if they've got the right person in position, they will be able to take it back. Now America has absolutely has incredible military leaders, some incredible military leaders, and when you, when you have to step up and lead of an assault like that on a city, I mean American leadership would be, would absolutely make a change and would be extremely positive for the situation on the ground. Do you think that America should go back into Iraq?

Speaker 2:          01:13:13       Well, first of all, we're already back in Iraq were on the ground. We got 3,500 troops there. This is a, and I hate to answer your question with a philosophical answer, but war is very difficult and very tragic and very evil in its own right, and so you should be very, very cautious about pulling that trigger and initiating a war because horrible things are going to happen. Horrible things are gonna happen. Enemy are going to be killed, friendly are going to be killed. Americans are gonna be killed. Civilians are going to be killed. This idea that we're going to go into a, a worn urban environment and we're not going to kill any civilians. No civilians are going to die and you have to understand that. And I, I talk about this when people ask me this question, there is two types of will that you have to have if you're going to go to war to types of will, one is the will to kill people and like I said, it's going to be enemy and you're going to focus as much as you can on killing the enemy in some civilians are going to die there. That is what is going to happen. And you have to understand that that is part of what you are getting into. So you have to have, you have to have the will to kill and

Speaker 2:          01:14:59       you also have to have the will to die because Americans are going to die and young men are going to come home in coffins and that's a horrible thing. And so if you're going to go to war, you should be going to war

Speaker 2:          01:15:29       with a clear vision to win, to win. And I think if we have the will and we have a plan on, on winning, then we should. We should execute that plan. But if we're hesitant and if we don't have the will, then we should stand by until we develop that will and we can sit outside and we can shape and we can. We can try and shape events which we should. We should have a leadership role in the world. We should be looking out for American interests. I know that sounds like taboo language in this day and age, but we're America and we should look out for American interests around the world. That's what we should be doing. And there's nothing wrong with that. That's what other countries are doing. They're looking out for their interests and when, when we're all looking out for our own interests, there's a balance and things can move forward. So do you think right now with the limited amount of troops that are in Iraq, it's a, you said 3,500 now at one. What was it at the height? I don't know. Over $100,000. I mean at the hightest, probably even close to 200,000. What would it take to develop that will that you talk of? Do you think that the United States needs to see some other Paris like event? I mean we already had September 11th, they killed 3000 of our

Speaker 1:          01:17:09       people on our home soil. Um, but that was 14 years ago and for a lot of people that might as well be another world. True, true. Um, I, I, I got to ask the other day about the warning signs, you know, to do. Are we paying enough attention to the warning signs or are there enough warning signs in it? I just, I kind of shake my head. I mean, what more warning signs do you need? Then go watch youtube videos and they're like, we are coming to kill you. We are going to destroy you all that. What? That's the warning right there. The warning has been issued. Standby for people like me that are completely on the outside of the military. It seems like isis came out of nowhere. It seems like once Arab spring started happening, we started pulling out of Iraq. All of a sudden you started hearing about the isl or Isi or isis varies.

Speaker 1:          01:18:10       They use the term Isi, which was, which was ice Islamic state Iraq. They use that and I think 2007 was the first time they use that as they started to take a area over in Syria. They threw the l on the end of it, which is Lavonne, which is the historical name for that, that region and the other one is Syria. The SS is so it's the same people. It's the same people that were there and will continue to be there until we route them out. What the. What I was getting at was that it wasn't something that anybody here had heard about as an organized thing. We had heard about insurgents in Iraq, but we had never heard of it in in a like with a name like like Isis. Now that it's a name, it's like an identifiable enemy and when you're in a war against terrorism, one of the things that I think kind of freaks Americans out, especially those that don't have a connection with the military, is this idea of a war against terrorism is, is this open ended proposition?

Speaker 1:          01:19:12       There is no enemy, you know, like the Er, there's no, there's no definitive end to this. Like when Japan surrendered, World War II was over, people were kissing in the streets, that iconic image of the sailor kissing his girlfriend in the street that we didn't, none of that happened for us in this country. There was no definitive ending and when we've pulled out of Iraq and we're planning on pulling out of Afghanistan and then we see isis build up and get bigger and stronger and scarier and we see what happened in Paris and we see what happened in Lebanon and in Nigeria and we see these terrorist attacks and we're like, well wait, when is this? Is there ever going to be a point where we have a soldier and his girlfriend kissing in the street is they're going to be an end. Is there going to be a confetti billowing in the main street? And a parade doesn't

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       seem like it. I would say that that's an accurate assessment that it doesn't seem like it.

Speaker 4:          01:20:13       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:20:15       We got a long fight, you know, and, and you asked where did isis, how do we start hearing about them? Well, the same thing we were talking about earlier. Social media. Yeah. They've got social media. They're aiming it at, you know, a disenchanted people all around the world that can cling onto something that will give them some sort of a identity. Yeah. That's one of the most bizarre things about this. When you see people like these young girls from the UK joining Isis and you know, they're escaping their country and going over there and joining isis. Like what, what is happening here? Like how disenchanted do you have to be where that looks attractive to you? The two girls, I'm sure you saw this in the two poster girls for Isis, uh, one of them died three to six months ago and they just got the latest report on the other one that was trying to escape Isis and they beat her to death.

Speaker 4:          01:21:13       Yeah. Did me

Speaker 2:          01:21:18       unquestionably. It seems to be a growing force in a more dangerous force. Every day I got, again, I think it was on twitter, someone hit me the other day on twitter, um, you know, this is an idea and you can't bomb ideas was the, was the statement to me and you know, I try and avoid getting into these massive sort of political debates or whatever, um, especially with 140 characters. And that being said, um,

Speaker 2:          01:21:52       Nazi-ism was an idea that was defeated through military force. Slavery in America was an idea that was defeated by military force. Imperial Japan was an idea and to religion that was defeated by military force and none of those ideas would have stopped without military force. And this is an idea that can be defeated with bombs. And this is also an idea that unfortunately in this country gets connected to all Muslims. The idea behind what these people are do or doing gets connected to all Muslims. When in reality, most of the Muslims in the world, they don't want something like isis to be in control. They don't want to be in a perpetual state of war. They don't want to have to worry about these quote unquote savages. And what they're doing, yeah, I mean the isis has killed hundreds of thousands of. Well, I dunno, I dunno what the number is, but we know that isis has killed thousands and thousands and thousands of Muslims, you know, they went into Ramadi and killed hundreds and hundreds of Muslims that had worked in some way with the coalition forces that they could have a peaceful city. They murdered them all. So let's say Donald Trump becomes president and uh, he listens to your podcast with Tim Ferriss and he read your book and he goes, Jocko, I'm coming to you for advice. What do I do? I don't know why I said Donald Trump for president. I'm hoping that that's our own isis.

Speaker 2:          01:23:25       Let's whatever. Fill in the blank. New President person becomes a known size head person. I didn't even go with woman or man. Uh, what, what would you do if you were, if you were in a leadership position, if you were in a position to make a decision or to, uh, to start a process, what would you do? We would destroy them. You would just go right back in. We would destroy them and you think that that's what America should do right now? Yes. Yes. It is a cancer that is growing. It is malignant and it needs to be destroyed. So what steps would you take? Like what? What would you do if you were in a position of power right now? You know, it's interesting. People get this idea that this is some crazy complex situation and it's going to be all hard and all this.

Speaker 2:          01:24:19       I could pull together like two first lieutenants from the Marine Corps, which is like the junior officer in the marine corps and say come up with a plan to defeat isis. You got two hours and they do it and it'd be a good plan. This is not a complex situation. How many people you're dealing with when you talking about Isis? I don't know. Twenty thousand, 10,000? 4,000. 100,000 stuff to tell it. Yeah. It's tough to tell. It doesn't matter. You assess it, you make you, you bring what you need to the table and you defeat them. So what do you think is holding back from us doing something like, I have no idea. Is it frustrating to you? Yes. Because if you got kids and you see the, again, a malignant cancer on humanity that is growing unchecked when we have, we're, we're like the master surgeons that have the ability to go in and eradicate this disease and instead of doing that we're just, we're just not doing anything.

Speaker 2:          01:25:21       So do you blame this, the current administration? Do you blame the, the climate of the American public right now? The political climate where people just don't want to be involved in another war or enter into another prolonged interaction? I think people are always looking for the easiest way out and going in as a hard decision to make. It's a very hard decision to make and it's be very unpopular decision and it would be the short term pain that everyone's afraid of. That's what one of the things that's so disconcerting to me about drones because it seems to me that what drones are is a way

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       that we can avoid American casualties so people don't complain about it as much. So we send this robot in there to fly in and then launch missiles and the good thing is it doesn't create American casualties, but the bad thing is it doesn't seem to be nearly as effective. It's sort of a wishy washy attempt in some ways at war it seems almost like it would be something that would, you would use in a supplement as, as well as a military attack. Like they would be a part of it instead of being the only thing that you used to try to combat these people. Does that make sense? I don't know if we have enough drones to get the job done and they're effective, but I mean a drone is going to take out. I Dunno. Twenty, 20 bad guys. So that'd be a lot of drones in action.

Speaker 1:          01:26:51       I don't know if we have that kind of capability yet, but we will someday. You know, someday we'll have a robot army and we'll be dealing with some terminator type situation, right? Yes. But right now it's almost like a, we need to get smacked. Like something needs to happen before we hit back and I can't, I cannot in good conscience agree with you because I don't even want to say those words. Yeah. You know, it's just a horrible thing. You don't want to put it out. It's a horrible thought. Yeah. It's a horrible thought. Especially when you start talking about a dirty bomb, you know, and like, Oh, here's a sector of America that no one can live in anymore because it's been contaminated. It's radioactive now mean. That's real. And again, for some reason the warning signs which can be seen, you know, anywhere you look, we're ignoring them.

Speaker 1:          01:27:45       I think people mean speaking for myself and speaking for the people that I come in contact with, I think people are becoming more and more concerned about isis on a pretty much daily basis. I think one thing that Paris did do is it woke a lot of people up as two possibilities that something like this can happen and that this isn't the end and this is, this is ramping up and if they have the kind of resources to pull off something like the Paris attacks, who knows where this is going. Totally agree with you. It is a very scary time. What do you think is going to happen if you had to guess, what do I think is going to happen in terms of the terrorist attack in America? No, no. In terms of our approach to dealing with something like Isis. Yeah. I think it's very difficult to predict the future, but not not to be just a big cop out over here. I'm not trying to do that to you, but there's so many different ways that this could go and you know, now you've thrown Russia into the mix because they took down the Russian airline. You've got a guy like Putin who is a gangster. You know, and I say that in both contexts of have negative and positive. I mean, the guy

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       in a negative way, he's a gangster that's, that's like scary with his thought process and at the same time like props, the guy's a gangster and he's going to smash them people you've got now, Turkey in the mix. I mean, it's just a very, it's a complex situation that's getting more complex all the time. And the scariest part about it is that America is not in a leadership position. We are not influencing the world the way we once did. We are not. People are not looking to us as the, as the leaders there were in the backseat. And that's scary. We should be in a leadership position. There's nothing wrong with that. Is Not bad to have a benevolent country and, and I know people are going to go crazy. But uh, uh, generally benevolent country that's sitting here, you know, given billions of dollars of aid around the world, never taken any soil and kept it.

Speaker 2:          01:30:03       I mean, we've, you know, I guess in modern times we've never taken any soil and kept it. We've given Germany back to Jeremy. We gave Japan back to Japan. You know, we've, we've, we're, we're a fairly benevolent country. Again, I know we've got faults, I know we've done things wrong in the past. I'm sure we'll do things wrong in the future, but to have us not in a leadership position is a very disturbing time. And when you say that we're not in a leadership position, what do you think the shift is and where do you think had happened? I think it's been happening and I think, you know, I think the current administration is definitely not, um, as experienced as you would hope and I think there's a lot of, a lot of naive attitudes about what the rest of the world is like. So this administration you think was the beginning of the shift away from America being in a leadership position? Yes. What do you, what kind of a president do you think would change that? Somebody that has a better understanding of the nature of the world, like a John McCain type guy? Yeah. Maybe like a, like, like, you know, again, I'm not going to sit here and try and think of who the best presidential candidate would be. I mean, we have a hard time figuring that out in America as a whole, but again, you look at a guy like, you look at a guy like Putin and you look at a guy like Obama. Putin's

Speaker 2:          01:31:34       whole existence has been geared towards this, you know what I mean? A KGB guy. I mean, he's been a player on the world stage and a part of it for his whole life and he's got an acute understanding of it and he's a black belt, you know, he's a legit black belt and you just see these other, um, uh, you see the, the naivete of, of this administration.

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       And it's, it's, it's really hard to. It's hard to understand. It was one thing that Obama said it was yesterday or today that just drove me crazy. He was talking about the attack on planned parenthood in Colorado Springs and he said things like, this don't happen in other countries. It's like, how the fuck do you say that? Just days after what happened in Paris, I was reading that just today before we started the podcast. I was reading it. I was like, that is one of the craziest things that someone could say after hundreds of people were killed in Paris because he's talking about it in terms of gun violence from a religious perspective that what the fuck happened in Paris? What it. Because it's not about babies. It's different. Like. Yeah, and he, I mean, he said something the other day too was I'm not interested in some notion of America leading and winning. What does that mean exactly? That's. Yeah, it's very, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:32:59       it's just,

Speaker 1:          01:33:00       it's an, it's, it's very disturbing. What does that mean? What did anybody ask him to qualify that or knows one of bands kind of speaking?

Speaker 4:          01:33:11       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:33:14       that's a weird statement for the guy who's the commander and chief of the greatest army the world has ever known, interested in staying, number one. I think the, the, the concept of a benevolent leader, the of a benevolent nation, you know, if you, if you do concede that the world, we're always being chaos and there will always be at least in terms of like foreseeable future, you know, the next one, hundred years or whatever we're, we're in until something crazy happens. I mean it would have to be something monumental life changing that, that stops conflict all around the world. You'd have to, if you were rational, pragmatic person and you're looking at the future, you'd have to say, well, we're going to have conflict. Especially if you look at places like the Congo or parts of the Middle East where people don't count and there's places where like you would have to educate them to the point where the future would look radically different than the present.

Speaker 1:          01:34:11       Right? So if that's the case, if, if conflict will be something that we're going to have to mitigate, no matter what, wouldn't you want to be the one that gets to decide? Wouldn't you want to be the person in a position of power? Yes. You would be. It's like the is a much smaller scale, but this is what I've always tried to tell people when they say, why would you want to learn martial arts? And what I always say is you don't want to learn martial arts because you want to go beat somebody up. You want to learn martial arts for two things, one, because you want to learn how to overcome incredibly difficult things, and in martial arts you're going to encountered times where you want to quit. You're gonna get your ass kicked. It's going to be difficult and it's extremely difficult to get good at it too. If you do get into a situation, you want to be the one who gets to choose whether or not someone gets hurt. You don't want to be helpless because being helpless is a terrible place to be, but it doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to go out and fuck people up and that's sort of the same idea on a macro scale that you would look at the concept of America being a benevolent entity or benevolent superpower. Absolutely. One hundred percent, right? You know, I mean,

Speaker 3:          01:35:30       you know, it's, it goes with everything that we do and when I say we, I'm talking about you, you know, you train, you work out, you try to be strong, you know, you keep yourself aware of what's happening. It's not because you want to go around kicking people's asses, it's because you don't want to have to kick everyone's ass. You know, people are not looking at Joe Rogan be like, Oh, I'm going to beat him up right now. Now they're going out of that guy. I know he trains all the time and if someone gets in your face, they're going to know that immediately. You know that when you can tell, you can tell by the way someone carries themselves what, you know, what they have and what they know, what they understand. Uh, you know, I got asked the other day, if you were president, you know, you asked me if I was got advice. They said if you were president, what would you do with Isis? And I said if I was president, Isis would not exist. President Jocko happen. They would not exist because

Speaker 1:          01:36:21       we would have a presence in the world that would prevent the growth of this kind of ideology, but what kind of a reaction do you think you would have from the American public? From the insulated American public? I mean, we're with, this is probably one of the most sensitive times ever in terms of they throw around the term Islamophobia. If you even criticize anyone that just happens to be Muslim. I mean we're. We're in a strange time when it comes to incredibly sensitive, maybe hypersensitive people that maybe don't have a good grip on reality. Well, what would you do? Take them over there and buses. Yeah, that'd be one thing. That'd be the way. It's interesting because I've already talked about this

Speaker 3:          01:37:09       Islamophobia. I mean I fought alongside these Muslims.

Speaker 1:          01:37:16       I fought alongside them to help them. My friends did and America did. We fought alongside these people to try and help them and we did. So how that gets twisted in some world to where you know, we're, we're not, we're, we're evil is completely beyond me. Well, I think because there is legit Islamophobia out there in the world, just like there's a. there's a legit hatred of Christians. There's legit hatred of Mormons. I mean, you're going to find groups of people that are hated and there's also people that aren't willing to look deeper, deeper into some some global issue. If you have a global issue that there's these people that call themselves isis or al or whatever they call themselves and you know, they call themselves the Islamic state. You Owe Islam. Oh, Islams bad. Muslims are bad. Muslims are evil. I was watching some thing.

Speaker 1:          01:38:12       There was A. Sam Harris had posted up on twitter. There was this guy who is, I believe it was in Virginia. He was a at a like county, one of those meetings where you're talking about building something in the town and he was. He was talking about putting up a mosque and these people were screaming at him that Muslims are evil and you're evil. Cult is not going to come into our town and you're trying to invade our town and get out of here with your evil called. I'm like, okay. That's Islamophobia. That's right there. I mean, you're talking about a peaceful guy who just wants to be able to worship his, you know, his ideas, his religion in peace in this place. He wants to build a mosque and people want to, you know, they're furious at this guy. That's real Islamophobia. Right. But there's a big difference between something like that and what's going on in other parts of the world with Isis. A giant, giant difference. And I think that when people want to throw around that term Islamophobia, I think a lot of times what they're doing is they're just trying to be correct. They're trying to be politically correct socially correct, that trying to be sensitive and they're trying to let everybody know that they're not racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic or whatever, that they're open minded and progressive. So they're throwing around these terms and it kind of clouds the water.

Speaker 2:          01:39:38       Okay. I mean these are the, these people are running around calling, you know, Islamophobia. I don't know. No one's ever called me that. Not yet. I'm sure they will get already today on twitter. Yeah. I don't see them happening right now. I don't, I don't see how he could, I don't see how they could do that. You know, again, we, we fought alongside Muslim people, we ate with them, we put our lives in their hands and they put their hand, their lives in our hands and you know, America and my friends were killed trying to help them. So how I'm a person that could be called an Islamophobia is, is kind of a stretch I think.

Speaker 1:          01:40:26       Yeah. Well it rationally, but you're talking about people that aren't necessarily rational.

Speaker 2:          01:40:31       Well, you know, people paint their own layers onto things and make them into what they're not.

Speaker 1:          01:40:38       Well, I think it's symptomatic of what's going on with, with our culture too, is that this, these hypersensitive oversimplistic ideas and, and people that that would say these things like this don't have a real grip like you have of what it's like over there and I don't think anybody does other than people like you that have been over there and had been in combat. I don't think it's possible. I think that's one of the problems that we have. We're behaving like children and a lot of ways because we really have never had to live on our own. Yeah. And it's, it's, it's actually very similar to what we were talking about earlier with the traditional martial arts where you can sit there in your fantasy world and think that your ci is going to protect you and that as long as you spread love, you're going to be protected because your ci is strong and until you've been in a fistfight, you're gonna believe that.

Speaker 1:          01:41:38       And so that, that's Kinda like what you're saying. Do we need to get spanked or do we need to get into a fistfight before America realizes like, oh no, there's real problems in the world that need to be handled. This is one of the weirdest times everybody have been in my act about, um, this is the first time ever where someone broke into the White House or if you know that in 2014 was the first time anybody had gained access and there was a woman guardian, front door was unarmed woman caught in the front door and a woman who's in charge of secret service because diversity and one of my favorite parts was, there was an article written about when the guy knocked the chick over, ran inside and they said it was reviewed and gender wasn't an issue. Well, we're okay. Yeah, that makes lot of sense.

Speaker 1:          01:42:19       Like Brock Lesnar was guarding the door. The same thing would've happened. The guy would've knocked him over and he would have. No one would have ever caught the guy you just want to ran by and that's fucking ridiculous. But it's that same kind of crazy thinking politically correct, asinine thinking. You should have a fucking team if you're going to make the president sleep in a house that's in the park, should probably have a team of fucking assassins surrounding that building at all times and you should keep a lookout for dudes that are sprinting across the lawn, knocking over chicks that are guardian the front door. There's no doubt about it, but it's the same thing. It's like we're so soft and we're so used to being in this insulated world that we have here, this nice sweet bubble where we drive our eight mile per hour or eight mile per gallon suv.

Speaker 1:          01:43:06       I don't know how you would ever really illuminates all these problems that you're bringing up. I don't know how you get get these. I mean to the hand of the average citizen, like in World War II that you and me, if we were 13 years old, we weren't old enough to serve. We still knew that there was a war going on because we couldn't eat steak. We couldn't use any metal. We were gardening at night. We were shutting off the lights like we were impacted. All of America was impacted at the height of the battle of Ramadi, the height of it, at the height of the war of Iraq at the height of the war of Afghanistan, America, Americans at the mall. We're not impacted at all at all, at all. Not only that, they weren't even allowed to show photographs of coffins,

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       so the first time ever in the history of the United States, a history of the United States taking pictures during war time where they made it illegal to show photos of coffins, which is just absolutely insane. Like, how, how are you going to let people understand what's happening if you don't even allow journalists to show photographs of coffins? It's the, it's the bubble. You're talking about the same situation. What made you decide to leave the military? Well, a bunch of things. I mean, it wasn't like one day I woke up and said, all right, I'm done. Uh, you know, obviously if, if you haven't caught this up to this point, I loved. I loved the seal teams. Yeah. I loved being in the military. I'm at the 20 year mark. I had a bunch of different things that kind of weighed in, you know, I had a family that I hadn't seen or didn't know pretty much. So you start thinking, well, you know, maybe I should pay attention to them a little bit. I had completed sort of my last real job operational job in the seal teams and it was going to be a long time before I was in command again, have a seal team or have something that was important and from a war fighting perspective. So that was kind of kind of another thing that I looked at that was tough. And, and yeah, I just, I guess I, that's it. That's it really.

Speaker 2:          01:45:31       So what was your transition? How long ago did you begin to get out? I got out in 2010. Wow. So this is five years ago. Five years. Yep. And what was your transition was? We uh, started this company where we go and work with civilian companies doing leadership and management and you know, my, my buddy life that I was talking about earlier, who was one of the platoon commanders that was with me and Ramadi and you know, he, he had run into a company I had run into a company and they asked us to do some stuff and the next thing you know, you know, I gave one, one kind of leadership training to accompany and then they said, come back and train all of our divisions. And then the parent company of that company watched me and said, hey, can you come to our CEO Summit?

Speaker 2:          01:46:17       And then went to the CEO Summit and then a bunch of those ceos said, Hey, can you come? And then the next thing you know, I'm doing this. So what is the, what is the process like when you're, when you're doing these, uh, these speeches are, you're setting things up, how do you organize them and what you, you obviously your lifetime was in the military, right? So what was it about you and about what you brought to the table that was so attractive to them? I think it's because the principles of leadership and that's where we, that's what we talk about and that's what we teach is leadership. The principals leadership do change

Speaker 3:          01:46:49       whether you're, whether your mission is to capture kill bad guys or whether your mission is to manufacture something or sell something or produce something. You're trying to. You got a group of people, group of individuals and they're going to be diverse. They're going to be different. They're going to have different intelligence levels. They're gonna, have different personalities, they're gonna, have different goals, are gonna have different motivations and you got to take all those people and unify them and try and get them to accomplish a mission in the most effective and efficient manner. And that's leadership and it does it. Like I said, that those principles that we used in combat don't change regardless of what the mission is and what, what's good. You know, and I said this earlier, life is like combat but amplified and intensified or combat is combat is like life. But amplified and intensified and, and that means when we tell a story, like a leadership story about combat, it, it, it's so obvious what the, what the principal was.

Speaker 3:          01:47:54       Whereas in the business world, they might take six months or a year or maybe you barely even notice what the failure was, you know? And when we sit, when we, when we make those stark examples from combat, people go, oh, oh, I see how we're failing in this too. And that's, that's why I think people really took hold of, of what we did and how we put it across. So this was something that you were approached to do. This wasn't an idea that you had had and you thought about this will be my new thing. Yeah. And I mean, regardless of all this garbage that I talk in my life and I've always telling people to like plan and be prepared. Yeah. I, I almost completely fell into this with the fact that, you know, someone said, hey, can you come and talk to my people about leadership?

Speaker 3:          01:48:35       And I said, well, yeah, I've been talking about leadership for last several years in the seal teams and I've been in leadership position in some pretty tough situations and you know, that's just, that's just happened. Now, do you teach a course or is this a, is this like a one time seminar type of a thing? We do both. Well, so sometimes we go in, you know, and we'll do like a keynote speech and those are good. Those are good. Those are great, you know, we get a lot of positive feedback about those, but then sometimes we'll go in with company and we've done like two year contracts with companies where we've trained everybody that they have and we get all their leadership aligned on the same page and, and we'll, we'll go in for maybe a couple of an assessment, we'll look and see what, learn about what business they're in, will learn about what they're doing, how they're doing it, we'll see what areas they can improve on. We'll formulate a plan around that and it will come back and we'll train leadership. That's fascinating. So you have to kind of construct a course. Yes, yes. I mean the, the basic, like I said, the basic principles are always the same, but some organizations have different problems than other organizations. They all, they all have the same, you know, five, seven problems, you know, whatever that number is. Some of them were

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       really bad at this are really good at this or they're failing here, but they're winning here. So we got to go in and check them out, see what, see what the issue is, and then we get it turned around. Is this for warding for you d, do you enjoy doing this? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I, I, well, number one, I can talk about combat all day long and I can talk about. And even more than that, I can talk about leadership all day long because it's, it's, it's the, it's the most challenging thing. The most challenging thing about being in combat in a leadership position is not, you know, trying to figure out what the enemy's going to do and trying to, trying to organize a good plan. The most challenging thing is dealing with all these human beings that that's the challenging thing is getting these guys and girls to do what they need to do, what you need them to do, to get them to believe in it.

Speaker 2:          01:50:36       That's what's challenging. And we definitely learned lessons positive and negative. You know, that's one thing about our book that people have gotten a lot of feedback is this book isn't like, Hey, look what we did. Look how awesome we are. No, this book is. A lot of those chapters in that book are, Hey, this is what we screwed up. Here's the failure that happened. This was a horrible situation and it was my fault. That's where we learn the lessons. And I think that's what's made people relate to it more because we're not just saying, hey, we're the greatest thing in the world. No, we were, uh, we were humbled by combat. We were, we were humbled by the enemy. We were humbled by our own guys that did amazing things when we were around. So I think that's a little bit different as well. And again, I think that's one of the things that makes peep that appeals to the people is they look at this and they go, oh, I can relate to that.

Speaker 2:          01:51:30       I can understand it. I've failed to. I made a mistake. Oh, how did they handle it? Oh, they did this. Okay, got it. When you're talking about combat, you're talking about people organizing and staying together and figuring out how to lead. You're talking about these extreme consequences, the most extreme ever. And when you have these extreme consequences, obviously when there's a lot on the line, people are going to focus and some people are going to fall apart and some people are going to pull together, but you're gonna, you're gonna. Get people that understand the gravity of the situation. It would seem to me that it would be much harder to impart that into people in the business world. Amplified and intensified. So in combat lives are at stake. Absolutely. In business world, have you ever had to fire anyone before? No. It sucks. Have you ever had people lose their job and couldn't pay their mortgage and feed their kids because you screwed up as a boss?

Speaker 2:          01:52:26       No. That's pressure. That is mass. Have you ever lost hundreds of millions of dollars worth of capital because you made a bad decision? No, but you know why? It's because I'm not a leader. See, so there's good things and not being a leader is the, the benefits of non-leadership. So, so you know, we, we, when people asked me that question is to ask that question all the time. I'm like, Hey, it's not about, it's not about lives, but it's about livelihoods, right? You've got people that are relying on you to succeed and win and again, sure you get killed in combat. That's obviously the worst thing that can happen, but if you lose your job or you know your, your people lose their jobs. Many people killed themselves all the time. When they make bad business decisions, it's that much pressure. It's that much pressure for sure. And so that's why it does translate because business people relate to that amount of pressure and they understand how it feels to, to have that bearing down on them.

Speaker 2:          01:53:17       It just seems to me for a guy like you that maybe you will be even more attracted to going into business then you would be to teaching people how to lead their businesses better. Yeah. And I'm in, it is a business where you a business and it is definitely what we're doing. Um, and that being said, for me to now go into business, I'd have to learn some new business. Well, why not just take the skills that I do have, which is, you know, we know about leadership. So let's just help other people. And that is rewarding. It's very rewarding to talk to someone and have them go, I did what you told me to do and this is the result. This is the outcome that's very rewarding. And, and another piece of it is, you know, everything always ties to me back to America.

Speaker 2:          01:54:05       The, the, the businesses in this country are the economic power of this nation. And our economic power is the backbone of our authority in the world. And so to help businesses grow and achieve is, is very rewarding because I know that it's a, it's a very patriotic thing to do. Capitalism is, is, is a very patriotic piece of America. That's an interesting perspective. That's an interesting way to look at the big picture. And I agree with you. I'm going to say something that people hate me saying, but I'm gonna say it because I need to say it to you. You should have a podcast. People always get mad at me because I say this all the time to interesting guests, but this is not something that's difficult to do and you'd be fucking great at it. And I think that your perspective on the military and your perspective on our, our, our situation overseas I think would be very unusual, very unusual and very educated.

Speaker 2:          01:54:56       And I just think there's, there's no one out there that's doing it like, like you could do it. Well we definitely, I've, I've, you're not. The first person said that to me. As a matter of fact, when Tim Ferriss, like we got done with the podcast and he pressed stop on the thing and he just looked up at me and said, you need to do your own podcast for him. I've talked to. I've talked to. I've talked to some of my, some of my, some of my buddies about it. And uh, we're, we're working. You have to do man. Get a fucking phone. Yeah. Phone. Yeah. Press record, you know, sit down with people. It's not hard to do. It's easy. Trust me. No, it's, uh, it's interesting too, and I'm getting over the fact of, uh, like I told you earlier, I'm like, I, like I said on the Tim Ferriss program, you know, people that just talk for no reason and it's hard for me to get used to like the fact that somebody wants to hear

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       what I have to say that's not, you know, a seal or you know, a direct businessperson. But, uh, I'm definitely, you know what, I'll probably end up doing something with it.

Speaker 1:          01:55:54       Well, I think you know, great military leaders, whether it's Zau, it's sung sue, the art of war, whether it's me, a motive Musashi from the book of five rings, Great Warriors from the past have written books that civilians have gotten a lot out of and I think that someone like you instead of writing a book and your book, I'm sure it's great and I'm sure there's a lot of lessons in that, but on a daily basis to be able to do something like this. Anytime you want, just fire up your podcast anytime. Something like Paris, like the Paris attack happens. You could give your perspective instantaneously uploaded onto the Internet and it's just never been a time like that. It's wonderful that we could sit down and read what [inaudible] Musashi wrote hundreds of years ago. I mean, it's. It's amazing. It's interesting you should say, to try to peer into the mind of one of the greatest swordsman that ever lived and see his philosophies on life, but I think that today with the advent of the Internet and with the ability to broadcast yourself virtually instantaneously, I think you could.

Speaker 1:          01:57:04       You could make a gigantic impact in sharing that perspective and taking those experiences that you have so deserved and so earned and, and giving people this insight that there's just, they're just not going to get it. You know, I'm getting it from you. Like I said, I got it from you from that Tim Ferriss episode and I'm getting it even more from you now. It's a perspective. You're just not going to get from someone who wasn't there. You're just not going to get it. You're going to get these fuzzy, but it's like two people sit. You ever heard two people talk about martial arts? Don't know shit about martial arts, you know, that's what it's like to hear someone like me talk about the military. Really?

Speaker 3:          01:57:44       Yeah. And it's, it's again, it's another thing that, that is a, I'm

Speaker 3:          01:57:50       sorting out in my own head, which is this idea of broadcasting myself. Uh, it's just, it's just weird. I mean, you grew up, you were into this, you know, I think you, you've been a comedian for your pretty much your whole adult life for 26 years, so 26 years you were getting on stage. That's what you wanted to do. And honestly, when I first joined the seal teams, that was the most frowned upon thing was to be broadcasting yourself that you were a seal, that you were at what you did and it. And it took me a long time. I mean, right. Writing this book was a, was a,

Speaker 3:          01:58:25       it's, it's a really hard thing to do because you sit there and you, you know, you, you're, you're supposed to be humble, right? You're a warrior. You're supposed to be humble. Okay, well I'm going to write a big book about myself. I mean that just did, that just doesn't work. And so it was really hard and, and Lafe and I, that was one of the biggest things that we did as we edited it and edited it and edited it. We went through it just to just to make sure that we were coming across and saying things in a manner that really reflected that humility, which again, it's very hard to do because it's a dichotomy. It's a dichotomy because you're saying, hey, you got to be humble as a leader, but I'm gonna read a big book about myself. You know what I mean? It's just crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:59:08       And so when you're sitting here like, oh, you should have a podcast and I'm thinking, you know, you should broadcast yourself. And again, with the way I was raised because you spent your whole adult life in comedy, I spent my whole adult life in the seal teams and I was raised by these old Vietnam guys that were bad asses and they were like, oh, you don't talk about this. Right? And so I'm kind of going against this the way I was raised and, and so again I'm, I'm getting over it, I'm trying to get over it, but at the same time I don't want to get completely over it because that's part of, you know, that's part of the way I was raised and what I believe in. Even

Speaker 1:          01:59:44       I see their point of view. I, I totally understand why they would say you don't talk about it, but what I think the benefit of talking about it today as opposed to their time is through the Internet. You can broadcast in a way that would be like, look, no one's going to take a navy seal back in the day and give them a gigantic television show where they could say whatever the fuck they wanted, broadcast anytime they wanted. But if you have a successful podcast, you can reach hundreds of thousands of people with each episode, which is just like a successful television show. And because of that, you have the ability to educate people and give people this perspective that I said that I got from you that are just not getting. I'm not getting from anybody else unless they've been there, but I get it from you.

Speaker 1:          02:00:28       I get it from Tim Kennedy. I get it from Brian Stann. I get it from Andy. Stop. I get it from people that have been there and you. You get a different perspective than you're ever going to get from someone who's just pontificating or guessing waxing poetically on the nature of man and war. It's all bullshit. Until you talk to someone who's actually been there, you don't really understand what they're saying. I think that I think it would be gigantic. I really think you should do it. I really. I really think it would help a lot of people. I think it would help a lot of people understand from the perspective of someone who actually knows what they're talking about and there's not a lot of that in the world. I think this is also what you're talking about when you're talking about the leadership in this country. It's. I don't. I don't know if you should be someone who has served in the military in order to qualify for being the president, but I don't think it's a bad idea to throw it out there to to say that at the very least you should spend some time living in these environments where we're involved in massive conflict. At the very least you should visit them, spend a lot of time with the people who have lived and served and fought in these countries. So you understand

Speaker 2:          02:01:41       clearly with no fuzziness at all. What the fuck is going on in the world? Well, there's no doubt that I think military service. I mean

Speaker 2:          02:01:54       it was so good for me. It was so good for me. And would it be good for everybody would have been about Jamie over there? Look at him. I don't know either. So you just said, I don't know. I'm not 100 percent sure. I guarantee Jamie would get it all out of. I'm sure he wouldn't get it. I guarantee you. But he might wind up like that dude and full metal jacket with a rifle in the bathroom. Private Kyle. Yet. So, uh, yeah, um, I, I did, you know, in the military, did the military was great for me and, and, but again, you, you were born for this. I mean this is like something you were drawn to, like a magnet to metal filings. Yeah, no, I was, I was drawn to it, but

Speaker 2:          02:02:40       I was still like, when I joined my dad, my dad said to me, uh, you're going to hate it because you hate authority. That's what my dad said to me. I was like, okay, uh, and, you know, that gives you an indication as to what kind of kid I was. I was completely out of control and didn't listen to anybody and I was probably similar to what you were like, I'm guessing, um, you know, I was just now to control kid that just did whatever. And so joining the military it put it, put the structure around me and all of a sudden I could take all this energy that I had. And, and what's really nice about is you get this clean slate where they're like, okay, if you do this, you'll be successful. Here's what you do. Check these boxes and I was like, okay, I'm ready to do those things, and you just do them and you develop the discipline.

Speaker 2:          02:03:24       The discipline, and I talk about that all the time. You know, the, the fact that discipline equals freedom and the more discipline you have as a human, the more freedom you're going to have, which is completely counterintuitive. You know, people think, oh, you're living this discipline lifestyle, so that means you, you, you don't have any freedom. And it's actually the exact opposite. I have freedom because I have discipline, I have, I have, you know, financial freedom because I have financial discipline, I have more time, I have more time because I have the discipline to get up in the morning before most normal people get up. Those are the kinds of disciplines that you put in place. And those definitely get instilled through the military. Well, I think the one thing that disciplined definitely does help you with is it helps you get things done and when you get things done, when you, you actually do things, you, you, you, you have more success. If you have more success and sometimes a big part of success is just not being fucking lazy and just doing it, just get. That's like 90 percent of it is just showing up, get there and start working like you're not going to feel perfect every day. If I felt, if I only worked out when I felt good, I'd be a fat fuck because there's a lot of days I don't want to do it. I've been pretty much the same with everybody that that actually gets good at something that you get.

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       There's got to be those days you pushed through and they're probably going to be more numerous than the days you don't. And so the benefit of discipline in my eyes has always been that through discipline I get things done. I always tell them, I always say that I'm like the most lazy disciplined person I know because I don't want to do it, but I always do.

Speaker 3:          02:04:59       And I'd be interesting to get your perspective on this, this statement. So I also think that discipline is, is a pathway to creativity. And I'll tell you when I talk about creativity is another misconception about the military when you're on the battlefield is an absolute exercise in creativity. Okay? I already talked about how you're going to lead these people. What are you going to do? How you're going to influence them, how you going to talk to them? How are you going to say the right things? That's creativity. Now you throw on top of that, what am I going to do? The enemy, how are we going to attack them? How are we going to disorganize them? How are we going to get in their heads? That's all just massive creativity. And when I look at people that are artists like yourself, because you're a standup comedian, you are, I would imagine that the more disciplined you are the, you know, you got to get up and write, you gotta write stuff down. You got to read and find out about what's going on in the world so you have more things that you can jab baton and make fun of. You got to increase your vocabulary. So that you are quicker and sharper so that when people are saying things that you have more words to battle back at them, all those things, all that freedom that you get on stage, it comes from the discipline that you study. You learn, you read, you write, you talk, you go through things. Is that an accurate state?

Speaker 1:          02:06:19       Absolutely accurate. There's a great book on it. Steven Pressfield wrote a book called the war of art and press field was essentially like a ne'er do well until he was 40 years old. He was kind of a fuck up and then figured it out. Somewhere along the line I figured it out. I used to keep a stack of them in my old studio, not hand them out to guests if I thought they needed it. Take this because trust me, read this, because a lot of artists in comics, I bet musicians as well, but writers for sure. One of the big problems is sitting down and doing the work and you, you gotta and Pressfield talks about that in the most concise and beautiful way and he labels it like an enemy. He calls it resistance, you know, and that you have to sit down and you have to overcome resistance and that the pro goes to work and he doesn't matter if you're sick.

Speaker 1:          02:07:06       It doesn't matter if you have kids. It doesn't matter what you, you're a pro and you go to work and that just it puts it in your head that this is what I do and this is what. And you have pride in that. And then when you are in front of that keyboard and you look down the count, it says I fucking thousand words today, I put a thousand more than you, you, you, you're doing the work and out of that work, gems, blossom, little things. But you might have a day where you just write nothing but dog shit. So show up again tomorrow and tomorrow out of that dark shit, a flower emerge you never know. And that's the only way to develop. Real, like to, to really develop your potential. One hundred percent in anything. Whether it's as an author or even as a martial artist.

Speaker 1:          02:07:50       There's a lot of creativity in martial arts to be a great striker. You have to be creative because you have to. You have to develop patterns or execute patterns that are aren't going to be perceived like if a guy has a real simple one, two, one, two, you're going to time that shit and you were talking before the podcast about Holly Holmes victory over Rhonda Rousey and one of the things that we were talking about was that Rhonda had this very linear, straightforward attack. You knew she was coming and holly is a master at at countering, so all she had to do was wait and move and Rhonda was coming in one direction. There was no. There was. There was no variation. There was no creativity. It was a mad bull dog rush that had worked on everybody else before, but she found one person who was a virtuoso at movement and she needed creativity and it wasn't there and she needed that experience.

Speaker 1:          02:08:48       That came with having faced someone who knew that position and new new had a deep understanding of that movement and she didn't have that in their repertoire. And so that's the result that we saw. Like a striker, like Anderson Silva, he's extremely creative. If you watch, he's got a fight versus Tony Frequent in cage warriors, cage warriors. What the fuck was it called? In England, small organization in England where he practiced this step in upper cut elbow, like a sideways elbow and his coach was going, you're fucking crazy. Stop practicing that, and he would make his wife hold a pillow because it's his coach didn't want him to practice anymore because he thought he was wasting his time, so he practiced stepping. His wife would hold a pillow for him and he'd step in and throw this uppercut elbow. That's when he knocked out Franklin with and obviously the Franklin was outclassed in that fight, but he wanted to make a point and like the front kick that he landed the face of Vito Belfort.

Speaker 1:          02:09:47       Vito, I never saw that check coming because nobody had done that to him before because nobody had done that in the history of the UFC. Nobody had ever knocked anybody out. With the first kick you learn in martial arts, but the creativity to try something like that, he would throw punches to your thigh from standing. He would throw a jab to your thigh. He would throw a crescent kick, an inside crescent kick to your face, like what the fuck it was. It was part of what made him such an effective stryker is that he through these things that you just didn't expect him to do. There's a lot of creativity in Jujitsu. You know that? Yeah. Well, I got, you know, Dean lister and Jeff Glover, or my guys. Jeff Glover is one of the most creative guys in Jujitsu today. He's one of my favorite. He does this thing for folks who don't understand Jujitsu, don't know what we're talking about. He does this thing called

Speaker 2:          02:10:33       a donkey guard. He's so fucking crazy. This guy, he gets on literally, he faces you with his butt to you and he launches himself backwards like a donkey kicking and wraps you up and it looks so preposterous while he's doing it that so many guys, especially when he first started executing, it just had no idea what the fuck to do it. There is right there. Got Crazy. He is, he's out of his mind. He so uh, he so comfortable in every, like, you know, he trains everyday. We're the same gym and he trains everyday with whoever and he puts himself in the most ridiculously horrible positions. I'm talking like, okay, he'll let people get a rear naked choke on him. I mean he all watching them, like what in God's name, how was he going? And he will escape. He just put himself in horrible positions all the time just to organize, just to work on his defense and just to be in a bad way.

Speaker 2:          02:11:29       How does he avoid getting hurt? Because he's not a big guy. He's super, super, super flexible. I'm like crazy flexible and you know, he gets dinged up, but he just is very flexible and he knows where to put his body, you know, he's just a, he's kind of a freak because I knew that he had trained with you. I was gonna ask you like the idea of you and him training together for folks listening to this was the majority of our podcast is audio probably 90 percent year. About what to 40 or something like that to 35. Yeah. And Jeff's like, well, 1:50. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What the fuck? That's a big. I don't want to try. I weigh 200 pounds. I don't want to trade with anybody who's to 10. The fact that he's 150 pounds and he's training with gorillas, know how the fuck he does it.

Speaker 2:          02:12:16       He does it. He's just super relaxed and he just moves and moves really well. It's amazing. It's amazing. And you know, back problems. He's, he's all right. No neck problems. He is 100 percent at all times. Yeah. That's amazing. Yeah. Dean's getting little more dinged up. Do you know Dean looks like he ate a dean. I saw him the other day. I'm like, what are you, a 300 fucking pounds and I don't mean it in a fat way either. He's huge. He looks gigantic. He's, he's pretty big. Yeah, because he'd just been power lifting or something. Like what is he doing? Uh, I think he just eats a lot, but it's definitely lifting too because like food doesn't go right to your neck, his neck. He's a genetic, a genetic mutant. Another using genetic mutant and yeah, he's both, those guys are, are mutants, their actual grappling mutants where if you and I were to like concoct some weird, you know, like potion and create beings, you know, you'd make like a Jeff Glover because he's weird. Flexible, wirey and you'd be really good. And then you'd make a dean lister who's just a big mutant. Who you, you when you, when you catch dean you have to like do everything perfect. Because he's, his defense is really good and he just doesn't. It's

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       really hard to tap him with stuff, you know, like he, like he'll just give people, you know, his foot and be like, yeah, go for it. And it takes me like three days. I'll have to soften his foot up with like nine foot locks, then just crank it, granted grandkids and then, you know, on the third day I'll get a deep one and it'll already be like hurt. So. So, you know, so you have to soften them up overseas. Tenderizing meat. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:13:56       Well that was why it was so shocking when Josh Barnett tapped him because Josh Barnett tapped him and like old school side like headlock joke, which is a very rare. It's very rare that you see like a high level guy that executes that choke. Like the way Josh did. Josh has got that old school catch wrestling knowledge too, which is just such a different approach and you get used to a certain approaches and Josh has a very different approach and he's a very physically strong guys.

Speaker 3:          02:14:25       Well yeah, and I mean Dean is just a dean is a mutant and he is a gifted, incredibly gifted grappler. But his, you know, his training methodology and lifestyle is not really conducive to a competing like that, you know, unfortunately, that's a nice way of saying he's kind of lazy. Let's just make those noises. Hey, he, he, he could definitely train harder and uh, you know, I've, I've trained with all kinds of guys in the world, a world class, guys all over the place and dean is absolutely, you know, one of those guys that is up there with like, you know, a Hickson who have trained with Marcello, but he's like that crazy

Speaker 1:          02:15:15       good. Really? Wow. Well, I know he was one of the first real leg lock masters. Really understood like, and, and um, uh, who brought him in to. I'm into where someone brought him into adcc pride. No, I know he a fuck. Why am I blanking? Alan Belcher belcher brought him in when he fought a WHO's smart, who's the best leg locker in mma. And in that fight Alan just stopped everything Paul Harris threw at him and literally meet every single movement that I saw. I was like, oh, that, that's, that's, that's, that's, you know, like I knew exactly what dean had showed him and exactly what those movements were. That's amazing. What does Dean doing these days? Is he going to still compete or he's, you know, he's teaching Jujitsu

Speaker 3:          02:16:06       and, you know, hanging out. I'm getting after it, you know. Uh, I would love to see him just like get completely refocused and make a, make a run at when an atcc or whatever. Uh, one more time before he, before he hangs it up. But when you say is dinged up, like what kind of Shit? Just normal old, you know, Jujitsu Guy, you know, he's, his neck will be sore shoulder, will be heard, uh, just that kind of stuff, you know. But, but, you know, he is a mutant. He is a mutant that could, you know, if I think, uh, he, he in adcc his last, I think it was in China, his match against Buccella when we churches just a complete beast and you know, they went at it and that was a very close match. And again, if you watch training videos of [inaudible] getting ready for ADCC, he's training like a complete savage.

Speaker 3:          02:16:59       I mean, he's bringing wrestlers in, he's clean and jerk, he's flipping tires, he's doing everything that one does to prepare for a situation like that. And, and dean does not do those types of things, you know, okay, we'll come in and train a little bit and go on his natural ability as a mutant human being to get it done. It's always frustrating when you see a guy who is so naturally gifted who kind of like lays back. But that's, it seems to be, that's a lot of what happens is the people that are naturally gifted don't have to work as hard so they don't work as hard. It's also part of, you know, when I talk about Jeff and dean, both those guys, they're both and you know, you could throw Eddie and then you can throw all kinds of people into this category who are, who are, uh, kind of game changers.

Speaker 3:          02:17:45       You know what I mean? Well, you know, I don't know Eddie that well have hung out a couple of times, but I definitely know Jeff and dean and there they got some, they got some, some weird stuff about them, right? I mean they got some weird personality stuff and from my perspective that is, you know, know if you didn't have that weird personality thing than how are you going to be, you know, a 15 year old Jeff Glover and be like, Oh, you know what I'm going to do all day. I'm just going to train Jujitsu all day. Every day. I'm going to sit there. I'm gonna watch the youtube videos. I'm just going to get good at this. I'm going to train everyday. I'm going to compete all over the country. I'm just, that's what I'm going to do. That's, you know, if you're not some. If you don't have some, if you're normal, you're not going to do that on normal person's like, oh cool, I'm going to get a job at Walmart and then I'm going to do it.

Speaker 3:          02:18:30       You know, I'll train it. I'll train for an hour and half night. These guys were like, oh no, no, I'm just going to train all day everyday and I'm going to live in, you know, on the mat and dean, same way. Like if he didn't have that weird like spark that made him, that makes him. I mean, he's got some weird like knowledge. What's weird about him is if you ask Eddie Bravo about, you know, the rubber guard, he knows all this details about it, but if you ask them about a full lock or what, something that he doesn't know that well, he'd be like, Oh yeah, a little bit. You'll ask Dean about something that he knows nothing like you've never seen him do before. And he'll know all these detailed of the moves and I don't know if he, I seriously don't know if he goes and watches it on youtube or if he like studies or write it down, but he's got this weird little almost rain man. I'm, you know, idiot savant type. Weird thing in his head. He was one of those guys that had a really hard time transitioning into mma. Absolutely. His striking just never seemed

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       fluid. Like, and he, I know he worked hard at it. He just, for whatever his body is designed for trap things. Yeah. And you see that with everybody because everyone's got strengths and weaknesses and everyone's going to be good at something and bad at something else. Uh, you know, you and I know all of these examples of people that are like this. Every fighter, you know, he's got some weak area and then you get occasionally get a guy that liked gsp that's just like, well rounded. Um, but you know, everyone, even even things, physical things, physical attributes, you know, some people are just super mutant strong and some people are just super crazy flexible and some people have unbelievable natural cardio and some people don't. And so it's the people. Then there's some people that are really good at grappling. There's some people are really good at striking.

Speaker 2:          02:20:15       There are some people that are good at putting all those things together, which I always thought fader was very natural at combining his striking with his grappling and kind of making it all fit together better than most people could. Um, yeah, I agree with you on that. I think that was one of the things that really stood out about him was that he didn't fall into that trap that a lot of people do where if you're a really good wrestler but you have knockout power, you just knock everybody out fade or he would be. You'd be stunned and he would see your arm and he would dive into Kimora, you know, he would. He would always take the opportunity that presented itself, whether it was a grappling situation where there was a striking situation and his well-roundedness was one of the things that made him special on top of his knockout power and his aggression, his.

Speaker 2:          02:20:59       He was so well rounded who was his ability to flow with whatever was happening and he also had that Hump Humility and he had that calm like you, like you saw holly had the other day and I actually, I actually, again talking about social media. I posted, I haven't posted much on facebook the facebook before, but there's a video of holly talking about. She got beat by Sophia Mathias in kickboxing. It was a vicious fight. Watch it, laser kickboxing and boxing, kickboxing. It's, it's, it's, it's insane. I mean, she gets destroyed. Holly gets completely destroyed hanging on the ropes, getting punched in the head. It's awful. Then you watch the post fight interview with her and it, it. It's unbelievable because everything she says she takes complete ownership of the loss. She's like, I had a great training camp. I, my coaches were telling me to do the right things, but I wasn't doing what I was supposed to do. I wasn't fighting the way I was supposed to fight. The reason I last night is my fault. I did this and I will have to change things if I'm going to beat her and hearing someone. And the other part that was cool about it was she was getting emotional, like you could see like she wanted to cry. I mean she was crushed, but she, she kept control of her emotions and was another one. I saw that video. I'm like, man, this girl is, is

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       going to do going to do well in this fight. I mean, I, I, I had a pretty good feeling about it. Well, she's, she is incredibly solid, that's for sure. And that is so admirable when someone does take ownership of their mistakes. So important, so important. That's like we wrote the book, the book is called extreme ownership, that that's literally the time ladies and gentlemen right there. But, but that's, that is like the key though. The reason it's called that is because when we made mistakes, we owned up to him and furthermore when both Lafe and I ended up in positions where we were teaching leadership, lead life was teaching the junior officers that were coming out of the seal training, putting them through the junior officer training course and I was teaching, like I said, the advanced guys and so you'd get to seal officers and like I said, we put these guys through horrible training scenarios where everyone was getting killed and blown up and they'd be bought buddy carrying people through the desert and just, it's just awful.

Speaker 3:          02:23:21       And you come back from these situations and you talked to one of the, let's say one of the good leaders and you'd say, Hey, what went wrong? And the guides say, well, number one, I didn't give a clear enough plan. No one really understood what my vision was. They didn't execute because I obviously didn't give them a good enough briefing and you'd be like, okay, fair enough, and that guy would go and fix that problem. Then you get a guy that was would not take ownership of stuff that would come in and say, a user say, well, what went wrong? That training that was, you guys did a terrible job. What happened? He said, well, you know, my, my assault force commander didn't wait for my command before he left and he screwed up and my platoon chief wasn't heads up about where our casualties were being taken and my Lpo and they'd make all these excuses.

Speaker 3:          02:24:12       And it really was the difference between like who would be successful and who wouldn't be. Because the guy that takes ownership of the problems, what do you think the rest of his team does? Just just, if, if that person takes ownership of the problems, everybody on that team does the same thing. They don't say, yeah, you're right boss. It is your fault. No, they go, hey boss, you know what, I actually could have done a better job and and that spreads through everybody. Whereas when someone says it wasn't my fault, it was joe's fault, what does Joe do? Joe Goes, no, that wasn't mine because I'm not getting no blame each other, and guess what? The problem never gets lost. Exactly. So to hear holly talking about that after the fight and taking complete ownership of a loss was very impressive to me and then she went on to beat her like six months later. Unbelief. Yeah. Yeah. It's one of the most important things in getting good at anything is recognizing when you're not good. Recognizing when you make mistakes. It seems so simple. Right? But you know why? Because Ego. No, he goes, everybody's ego. It's like even even me, because I sit here, in fact I teach people about, you know, you've got to keep your ego and there's a chapter in there like you've got to keep your ego in check. When, when, when somebody, I'll ask somebody,

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       I'll be like, hey, is there anything I could have done better in that, in that speech or in that class? And they'll be like, well, you know, one thing that you could do, and I'm like, immediately I'm like for wrestling, wrestling, like my ego. I'm like, God, I'm such a loser. I'm sitting here telling them about their ego in check. And so everybody does that. Everybody does it all the time. No one can take criticism and you know, part of that biggest step of moving forward is a is, is learning how to take ownership of stuff and when it goes sideways and it definitely will. Well you need some form, some amount of pride and some amount of ego to get good at things in the first place because it's such a cow counterintuitive notion because you have to have a belief in yourself. You have to be able, like when you, when you first, when you start out at Jujitsu, your white belt.

Speaker 1:          02:26:10       I remember being a white belt and being like, oh my God, I am fucking never going to get good at this. I'm going to suck forever, but to to to look at people who are better than you and no, they had to have sucked at one point in time. Okay. There's gotta be somewhere along the end of this tunnel. There's got to be a light. I just gotTa keep going and Tigo Ego was going to say, I mean, ego drives you to be successful me to be successful. Egos. What's driving you? The problem is when you let ego go too far and you know everything, you know, everything takes balance. This is a dichotomy and everything, every part of you has a dichotomy. You know, you can get so into the physical aspects of things that you end up like doing a bunch of steroids and going crazy and ruining your health.

Speaker 1:          02:26:55       That's not good. The other end of the spectrum, you know, you can sit around and play video games and turned into A. Yeah, yeah. Well, there, there's, yeah. Bodybuilding is the best example of that, right? Because yeah, that's kind of dying out though, isn't it? Kind of bonded. Building out their stuff to you and I. It is, but I think there's a giant culture of people out there that want to look like huge mutant still. It's, I think, I mean I'm not in that world, but when. I mean a bodybuilding is a great example of that because when you start lifting weights like, God, I'd like to be stronger and you start getting a little bit bigger. You're like, oh look at that. I got a muscle, Ooh, this is cool, and then you keep going and then you keep going. But some guys get so fucking crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:27:40       They won't stop until they have 22 inch arms and they want to have thighs that are so big. They have to walk like they're, they've got a barrel in between their legs and you know, and they, they just can't help but they just take it to some completely unhealthy place. Yeah, that's a, that's rough. Yeah. Well, it's just the nature of trying to get good at something. You've got to recognize what's good and what is just fucking insane. Yeah. And it happens in training camps with fighters all the time to retrain. So bad, big part of the problem with a mixed martial arts, so obvious too, when you're overtraining somebody because all of the sudden like one night they'll just fall apart and they just won't be able to do anything. Right. And I'm always like, all right, go eat two steaks and take two off because they will get to a point.

Speaker 1:          02:28:23       You just feel them. You'll just feel and fall apart. Yeah, but you have to monitor your heart rate. That's a big thing that a lot of fighters don't do. Monitor your resting heart rate in the morning and if it goes up more than five beats in a day or two, most likely year overtrained or you're sick or you're struggling with something that would make. Steve Maxwell taught me that trick. He's like, every fighter should do that. And none of them do. They should monitor their heart rate and every morning his heart rate is like seven. Steve Maxwell can fucking. He can deal with anything. He's just one of those dudes, but he's just. He's another guy I want to talk about. A guy who's got a lifetime of wisdom comes to strength and conditioning and what he calls physical culture and the culture of taking care of your body.

Speaker 1:          02:29:05       Guys. Sixty two or 63 years old, fit as a fiddle, travels all around the world, training people. That's all he does. It doesn't have a house, doesn't. He has a. A bag that he brings with him when he travels around. All of this stuff's in that bag. I ran into her in San Diego because he's been downsizing and when I. The first time I ran into him in San Diego, he was down to living in an rv. That's when I first met him. I hear him on a podcast, whatever, you know, a year later or two years later and he's not have all my worldly possessions in a backpack. Yeah. He sold his rv and he's like, fuck it. I don't even know if he has a bank account. I mean, just. He's a strange cat man. He really is a strange cat, but a very at peace guy for sure.

Speaker 1:          02:29:52       Yeah. I mean, it's very interesting. I wouldn't want to live like that. I don't like living like that, but he's also been the guy that's lived the other way. He's had the house and needs that. The family and his son Zack is a very successful Jujitsu competitor and you know, got divorced and gave up the gym. He had the, all the, all the trappings. He had everything. He was like, Ooh, I like it better. Like this backpack. Maybe the key word there was trapping. Maybe he somehow built all these things around them that felt. Ended up making them feel trapped. Yeah. For him it's just he would. He figured out what he enjoys. He enjoys training, still doing Jujitsu to this day and he teaches a course, a Jujitsu for lifetime and it's all about maintaining your health while you train and you know, he's written articles on training, smart to avoid injuries as you get older and you know how to pick the right training partners and make sure you know, you know, nobody's trying to hurt you, but you could keep a, an active martial arts lifestyle deep into your sixties like he is.

Speaker 1:          02:30:49       Yeah. You got to be thankful that you started Jujitsu a little bit younger because you got to get in. Even today, if you start. Jujitsu is an older thing. We have all kinds of older guys come into the gym and it's that first like year where they just don't know where to put their body yet and they don't notice. They don't know to say no to that 21 year old juiced up marine that's like in there to get after it. Like they smack hands to roll in. This guy's gonna tear them apart and that's, that's how guys get hurt. If they're, if they're older and you know they need to ease into it a little bit. Pick training partners carefully. Got To pick your training partners carefully and there's always gonna be the guy that hurts people. There was just this giant German dude that used to roll it.

Speaker 1:          02:31:34       Our gym is to always get everybody in leg locks and blow their knees out and he's just never rolled with that guy. I'm like, I've, I've been leg locked by dean on. You know, how many times, like, I mean, we might be talking thousands of times a heel hook, knee locked, but you know, I've never been hurt, you know, and I've, I've gotten him, you know, not thousand signs with plenty of times and we've never heard each other, you know, because we, we know what we're doing. Yeah, I'd way rather roll with a black belt for sure. Then some fucking psycho blue belt. It's just too dangerous. Sometimes they just, they spazz out and they head, but you accidentally and weird shit happens. It's, um, I'm. One of the things that I think is amazing is a, that Anthony Bourdain has gotten crazy into Jujitsu over the last, I think two years now.

Speaker 1:          02:32:27       He just earned his blue belt. He's 59. Yeah. That's awesome. What's, it's amazing. He, he lifetime of smoking cigarettes, doing heroin, like never, never was fit, never exercise at all when I first met him. Uh, like he would laugh about fitness. He just wanted to drink beer and you know, he, the first time we did my podcast, we got so high, I don't even know how we talk. And then, uh, I just did a TV show like a couple of weeks ago. We're in Montana. All he wanted to talk about Jujitsu. He's obsessed. I'm showing them some techniques. We're talking about different guys that liked to do different things at different approaches and gay versus no gay. And John Donner, her and you know, Gary Tone in an Eddy Commons and all these different. I'm like, this is amazing. I can't believe what a transformation. This guy's overtaken Jujitsu.

Speaker 1:          02:33:16       Definitely. I mean, people can get into all kinds of weird stuff, right? People get into surfing, people get into skiing, people get into rock climbing. There's definitely something. I'm more in Jujitsu that gets into people's heads. And it definitely happened to me. I mean, I was completely and I still am. I mean I still cannot stop a youtube video of a cool move. I mean I just, I just have to watch it. Yeah. And I think it's because there's such a cerebral part of it, there's something about it. And I see this, we know we teach kids and you'll see the, the, the knucklehead kids that kind of knuckle dragging kids are kind of big. They don't really get it. But then you get this kid, some smart kid, you can tell they're smart and those are the kids that get really into Jujitsu because they realize like, Oh, if I learned this, I can beat that big kid.

Speaker 1:          02:34:06       Yeah. And that's where it starts. But yeah, Jujitsu can definitely be addictive. Well, Jujitsu's the only martial art where it really works, like in the Bruce Lee movie where the little guy really can beat the big guy because the reality is like if you watch the old k one days where Bob Sapp was fighting when Bob Sapp was 375 pounds with ABS. Oh, you've never seen anything like it. He was he on steroids. He was steroids. There was nothing human left. And he beat or Nesto hoost twice who is arguably one of the top two or three greatest kickboxers ever. And Bob Sapp just bum rushed him and donkey Kong dumb. Just beat them down with clubbing punches because he was so much bigger than him. He was more than 150 pounds bigger than him probably. I think he used it at his biggest. It's probably like 2:30. Maybe to your point, I was in Japan.

Speaker 1:          02:35:05       I was with dean. As a matter of fact, when Nogueira submitted sap, that was insane. That was insane. That was insane. That was a perfect example. For example, a boy, it had to be Nogueira though because sap, sap dropped him on his head. Pile drived him on his head. I saw him the next day. No Gira, like after the fight and he was hurt. I mean he was up bad. Oh my God. It looks. I'm a big neck. Was fucked up apparently forever. After that I, he hit his neck essentially. Never recovered after that fight, you know, that was one of the fights that fate or passed on fader wouldn't fight Bob's out. It was like, Eh, you can take your fucking clown show, take your circus act and no heroes. Okay. Fader was like, no thanks on the freak show. But then again, he went and fought troy who's a giant guy too, but giant actually gigantism giant, not giant like juice to the gills giant.

Speaker 1:          02:36:00       But look, Bob Sat, I mean all power to them. They didn't have a law against it and he went in there and they were paying them and that's how he made a ton of money doing that. But the point is that in Jujitsu, like maybe an MMA, it's a little bit different because you know, obviously Bob Sapp Drop Nogueira on his head and most people would have been done then, but Nogueira was legendarily tough, but a small man can tap out a much larger, stronger man on a regular basis. I watched Rigo Rodriguez in Abu Dhabi go against Marcello Garcia. I was there and were either in La and when Rico threw them on his bed, when Marcel took Rico's back, so rico through himself backwards and slammed on top of Martin, like Marcel was like a backpack on Rico's back. Rico's like 2:40 something maybe even heavier through himself backwards and landed all his weight on Marcello ourselves. Shook it off and leg lock them. They're incredible, incredible. I mean Marcella was like 160 pounds, maybe one 70 maybe, but just so skilled and so dangerous with his Jujitsu that he was the favorite in that, which is incredible. And that's, that's where I think that addiction comes in because I think it's just a cerebral thing where people realize that it's like you said, it's this real force. We're now one

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       of my, uh, my, my kid asked me, you know, that movie the incredibles. Yes, there's kid. These people have superpowers. And My, uh, my son asked me a data, is there really such a thing as superpowers? And I'm like, Jujitsu is definitely a super power. You know, if you remember the days before anybody knew it, if you need a little tiny bit, you were just get viewed. No one can stop you. It was awesome.

Speaker 1:          02:37:41       What's also amazing to see the progression of Jujitsu in comparison in 1993 because the Jujitsu of 1993 was so primitive in comparison to what you have today. Like the guys who are winning with Jujitsu. God though the setups were so obvious, you could see the arm bars a mile away. There was nothing crazy or weird about it. And you look at that in comparison to today, like Jacques Array, like when Jocko array gets armbars, it's like a work of art. I mean, you, you watch his setups, you look good, Lord. Like he tapped Chris Kamozi with an arm bar and I've watched the transition, the way he controlled them on the ground and the scrambled to arm bar. I probably watched it 40 times in a row. I just played it back and forth and went, fuck one more time. Fuck. I needed perfect placement of the Shin, the knee that pressure, the hips, everything's in place. The control of the arm. And it was a, it was a done deal from the moment he started his movements. Now that to me is like, that's just as beautiful as any painting than anybody's ever made. There's no doubt. One hundred percent is an art to that. No doubt about it. What year did you start?

Speaker 2:          02:38:49       Uh, [inaudible]? Ninety two or 93. Damn. You got an early, got an early. Luckily I had a pre UFC. Yep. We, we knew when we launched that first UFC, we all knew while there were stairs, three or four of us that knew that hoists, that release Gracie was going to rise. That's amazing. We have this old seal master chief old Vietnam era, seal master chief named Steve Bailey. And he was, he was like a high level white belt and he had trained with flooring, gracie up in the garage, open torrents. And so he knew he knew Jujitsu garage, the infamous garage, like the epicenter. No kid in America. But this Guy Steve Bailey had trained there and you know, one day we were over on deployment over in Guam and he said, hey, who here wants to learn how to fight? And I'm like, Hey, I want to learn how to fight.

Speaker 2:          02:39:39       And he just took us all and just choked us all out, you know, I mean like, okay, you, you attack me and just chokes on. I'm like, okay, I'll listen to whatever this guy is saying. So. So he taught us, you know, the basic, you know, like the rear naked choke and the arm lock and like the American or something like, you know, we're talking like four or five different moves and with those moves, like I never, I, I every scrap I'd get into, you know, I just force someone into the rear naked choke or force them, but they had no idea what was happening. So it was actually amazing. But, uh, but again, I thought at that time that, that,

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       that was Jujitsu like was this finite thing a lot of people did. Yeah. And then you realize, you know, that it's completely unending and it changes every day. John John Machado had a guy that moved to black belt and uh, he was a very good martial artist. He was very physically strong. This guy, he was a big bulky dude, like a naturally big bone, strong guy that gave people a lot of problems and then decided like, didn't just decide this, but set it publicly. I've learned all I could learn about Jujitsu and now I'm going to learn all I can learn about Moitai. And everybody just went, oh dude, we're done with you. Oh, it was like, it was so ridiculed in the community and in the people in school that everybody. Like I was like a blue belt at the time and I was like, what the fuck is this guy on?

Speaker 1:          02:41:05       Like you learned everything. How can you learn every. There's no end. Jujitsu doesn't end. It goes on forever. Like you can't get. You can always get better. It's not, it's not something until you achieve the speed of light. And that's another, another great thing about Jujitsu is because it like combat, it reflects life. End of the day. You start saying that you're good to go. Like in a leadership position or whatever task you're working on the day you say, I've learned everything there is to learn about. This is the day you start to lose. And I know that humility is something that you have to keep yourself in check. Because again, I got asked the other day, you know, when were you, when was your high point of leadership? And I'm like, no, I never had high point of leadership. I was always trying to learn, I was always trying to figure out what I was doing wrong and what mistakes I was making because if you don't do that, that's.

Speaker 1:          02:42:00       That's something I learned from Jujitsu or you know, if you don't do that then that you're going to get passed by and other people are going to figure something new way of doing it and you're going to be left in the dark. Yeah. Is much as I like to use, like the term that was perfect. There really is nothing perfect in human beings. There's always room for improvement. There's always a shorter path is always a quicker victory. There's always, there's always new things to learn and as soon as you start thinking that you've mastered something to the point of, of, of an end, like if you kinda missed out what it's all about in the first place, it's all. You're constantly uncomfortable. You're supposed to be constantly uncomfortable, and then in these little victories that you get, the good thing about when people tap, you get, oh, I get a little nice feeling right here. Then they're like, let's go again, and then I'm like, oh fuck. Back to being uncomfortable and there's no getting around and then he taps you and you're like, oh shit should have quit while I was ahead. No, no, because you're missing the point. The point is that it's a, it's a long path, a long arduous path and I think anything that's worth doing is probably like that. There's no doubt about it. And, and that's another, another piece again, another place where Jujitsu is like

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       is eat. You think at some point you think you know, like you think you're good, you think you're doing pretty good and then you just get smacked or you get smacked with something. And like now like when you were 25, you were like, I'm pretty, I'm pretty good to go, you know, I'm pretty, I pretty much know what's up. And then when you're 30 you're like, I didn't know anything. I was idiot. And it's true like even. And so I think one of the, one of the things that provide some small portion of like maturity as a human being and as a man is when you get to the point where you actually realize that you don't know everything and you're like looking at yourself like I'm 44, and I'm like, yeah, I'm going to learn so much in the next three years, five years, I'm going to look at myself at 44 and go, you have to see how stupid you were then. And when you come to that realization, I think that's a pretty positive thing because it takes a while to figure out that hey, you don't have everything figured out. You're, you're pretty stupid right now even though you don't think. So.

Speaker 1:          02:44:12       Another thing that things like Jujitsu teach you, and I say Jujitsu, but it's really an all martial arts thing. The problem with the other martial arts other than Jujitsu is at a certain point in time, you can't really practice them 100 percent. Yeah, like striking. You really can't practice striking 100 percent for very long or your brain starts to give out just the fact and Jujitsu, you can Jujitsu, you can do it deep, deep into your fifties. I mean there's like a. we're Anthony Bourdain, he's pushing 60, still doing it and you know it's not that he's going to be a world beater, but he can get the most out of it the most that he can get out of it. It's that stays the same like what you get out of it stays the same regardless of your were regardless of the success, like what you're getting out of it.

Speaker 1:          02:44:59       Even if you're getting tapped, what you're getting out of is doing your best and overcoming and improving upon what your best is every day and doing so in a situation where there is extreme consequences, you're going to get strangled. You know you're going to get your arm broken. If you don't tap, you're going to get your leg fucked up. If you don't tap, there's. It's not as extreme as combat obviously, but it is extreme. You can get in a sport that you're participating in an activity that you're participating in voluntarily in America at 5:30 on a Tuesday, where are you going to get 30 people that are going to show up, slap hands together and then hug it out after it's over and go, you're gonna be here tomorrow. Yeah, RLC man. And then you know, back again tomorrow. Same thing. That's

Speaker 3:          02:45:45       another kind of primal piece that makes Jujitsu so intense is if you and me role like and I get you or you get me and I tap in my heart. I know that if you and I were fighting for survival, I just lost and you woulda killed me and I see this with little kids. When kids compete, you tell them, listen, just go out there. Have Fun. It's going to be fun. You know? Just go out there and do your best. I don't care if you win or lose, just go out and have a good time. You tell them that. You tell them that, tell them that if they get tapped date, they start crying.

Speaker 1:          02:46:27       It's so emotional. And why is that? Because a part of them inside their head that they don't even know exists, knows that that person had they been in a mortal struggle. They got beat. They got their ass kicked. Yeah. It's not like someone. This is what I always say like somebody dunks a basketball on you. It sucks, but it doesn't mean anything unless you decide it means something. What does basketball escalate into? We'll do all sports. All sports escalate into finance. So if you, let's get rid of the bat. Whatever else. Let's just fight. Let's just, that's why it's, you know, that's why the, I think that UFC has been so highly successful because it is, it's what it's, it's the ultimate, you know, in combat sport again, you know, barring combat itself. Well it's also why the dorks and pencil next hate it so much because they think it's a regression.

Speaker 1:          02:47:13       Back to the primal days of caveman combat. Like what are we supporting some fat fuck wrote an article for the New Yorker or New York Post or something like that, about the Ronda Rousey loss, about how barbaric and disgusting it was and what, uh, what, what bullshit that we were fed and that, you know, were made out that she was this unconquerable in to watch her beaten unconscious was disgusting. And you don't get it man. Like you don't get it like what you're doing with your fat face, like shoving cheeseburgers down your mug is way worse than anything that she did inside that octagon. It's interesting because that

Speaker 3:          02:47:48       kind of attitude can, can cross borders into other things. And you know, I, I, I end up talking to people you know, through, through our company, people that are smart. You mean every like I'll be in a room with everyone's, went to an Ivy League college, had been super successful in their worth millions and millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars. And I was given one of these talks the other day and we do, you know, of course they ended up asking me about Isis and all that. And as I'm sitting there looking and I'm thinking to myself like, these people are all looking at me and thinking I'm just a savage, right? I'm just like, Hey, I'm a knuckle dragger. We just need to go kill everyone. And so I tried to explain to them, I'm like, listen, I almost, I almost feel ashamed to say this to everyone here because everyone here is an intellectual and is very, very smart. But there are some problems in the world that there is not an academic solution to. And sometimes violence is the solution. And again, there can be a million arguments against that. But the reality of it is in the world, it's like you were talking about earlier in the world,

Speaker 2:          02:49:08       there are evil people that do evil things and the only way to stop them is to confront them and destroy them. And unfortunately we, we are so disconnected from that, that it makes people look at UFC and go, oh my God, how could that happen? And it makes people look at, you know, a military attack and say, oh my God, how could that happen? It can happen because we're human beings and we're imperfect and there are. There are evil people in the world. Well, the people that think there's no ever. There's no excuse for a violence solution. Take those people, bring them to Ramadi right now, right? Yeah. I mean, how do you deal with evil

Speaker 1:          02:49:54       when it exists? How do you deal with it? Do you, do you hug them? Do you knock on their door with flowers? What do you do? I mean, what is the solution? They don't have an answer. They have an aunt. The only reason why they even have that attitude is because they live here in this sheltered environment, in our beautiful bubble we call the United States of America

Speaker 2:          02:50:12       that many brave men and women have provided and will continue to provide regardless of what is said about them. And uh, God bless those folks out there on the wire.
