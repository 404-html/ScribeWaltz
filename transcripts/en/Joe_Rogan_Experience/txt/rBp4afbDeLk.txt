Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Keep this about a fist away and we're live. Douglas, first of all, thanks for joining me. Appreciate it. Great presence to be with you.

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       Looking forward to talking to you like you've become an example to me or your conversation with Sam Harris. Become an example to me of how squirly things have gotten lately with the way people interpret conversations about ideas because of this. Jamie, pull that thing up. This is a tweet that someone sent out and he got a strike, a community guideline strike just for listening just for putting you on his playlist, a conversation between Sam Harris and you. And uh, he. This man, um, or I don't know if it's a man. I'm, I'm, I just assumed I'm, I'm a problem. I'm part of the problem. Part of the Patriarchy pet are Kaye cee, cee x on twitter. That is his screen name or his or her or Azura screen name on twitter and got a community guideline strike for just putting this. Now I brought this up too. I was having dinner with some friends. One of them who used to work at Google and someone who's there was a highly ranked person. Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:01:17       Youtube. I brought this up and the exact quote was, uh, that was because it's hate speech. And I said, you said that so flippantly. I go, please tell me the contents of the conversation. Do you know what they talked about? I go, how did you say that she was white? I'm sure if someone marked it as a community guideline, strike a community strike. What is it called? The community guidelines that they must be hate speech. I'm like, do you understand? This is Douglas Murray and Sam Harris. I, I bet. I bet that's not what the conversation was about. I bet it wasn't too. I'm trying to think of what we did. Talk about it now. It's making me nervous. I mean, but I know that. I know. It definitely wasn't hate speech by any saying definition of those words that you, this sort of thing is very disturbing.

Speaker 1:          00:02:09       Very disturbing. You and you noticed that happening with other people and that's disturbing enough is more disturbing. Of course it happens to you, but it's real. I mean, I know Sam Harris a bit, not a hateful person, my most sorta yoga calm, blissed out west coast of America friend, and I'm pretty amazed that anyone at Google or anyone else would think that anything that could come out of his mouth with hate speech, hate speech, unless you decided that hate speech is just anything you'd personally don't like or the words don't matter anymore. Well, that's what I'm concerned about. I'm concerned that

Speaker 2:          00:02:50       there is an agenda that people who work in these. We don't even have to name the organizations, but in certain organizations are

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       left leaning and I mean it's probably better than being extremely right-leaning, so it really is. It's probably better than them being white supremacists, white nationalists hate groups probably far better that they're radical lefties, but it becomes a problem when you're doing things like that because things like that limit free speech and they limit the free discussion of ideas. I don't. I didn't listen to your conversation. I think I listened to a little bit of it, but I didn't listen to enough of it to know whether or not you guys started screaming at the end word halfway in. I'm sure I'd remember. I'm sure. I'm sure you would have this moment. I had another thing that I talked about with this same person. I brought up Jordan Peterson and you know that there's. There's issues with every time he's on podcast, the podcast get flagged for demonetization and the exact words were, he's a troublemaker and I'm like, what in the fuck are you talking about? Like are you listening to his conversations? He is very articulate and he's extremely careful going over these ideas that I think we should all be discussing, so to call this hate speech or to call someone a troublemaker. It to me, it's simple. Simplify or symbolizes what we're. What we're dealing with today. This is a very strange time when it comes to communication and the people that regulate and distributed communication.

Speaker 1:          00:04:28       It is whenever I've had a chance to speak with people in that kind of world and that sort of role. The question I always want to ask him on other things is, do you know where this is going to lead? Do you know what it's going to do if you keep breaking down definitions and terms and words, do you know what happens? For instance, down the road, if, if you keep on saying that Sam Harris and Doris Martin having a conversation about something is hate speech. Do you know what relief that's going to give other people down the road about what they're going to be able to get away with? This is what's being created all the time. In the moment. It seems to me there's this idea that you, you police the discussion along incredibly narrow lines that happened to surround your own comfort zone and call everything outside.

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       It's not just stuff I don't agree with or things that I would argue with or debate with hate speech. Uh, it's just, I think very, very dangerous down the road you can see exactly the trail that bit of gunpowder goes to. I can. Where do you think it goes? I think it goes to the point where people become cynical about any, any claims made about anyone and the likelihood is that if 99 times you've seen Sam Harris started with Mary Joe Rogan, Jordan Peterson, whoever called hate speech, then the hundredth time that somebody uses the term hate speech might be on somebody who is engaging in hate speech and all your defenses are going to be down. You've got nothing. You're very likely to become a very unlikely. Sorry to become skeptical. Um, and think I'm really gonna dig that. Most of us don't have time. We didn't have time to find out every single thought and words someone has uttered or thought. And so it seems very likely to me that down the road very, very bad people were able to get through the gates because we kept on making erroneous claims frivolously for our own short term gain and fro in short term comfort. And we'll end up basically bringing the gates down completely.

Speaker 2:          00:06:33       I agree with you and I, I think there's been a lot of discussion lately as well that I agree with where when you make these ridiculous claims about conversations, you, you empower, you actually empower radical people posed left wing ideology. Yeah. They get more extreme. You empower the extremists because they know that you're incorrect. They have evidence of it. They see your ridiculous behavior and the other really disturbing aspect of it as these are the people that are distributing speech, right? I mean think about how many discussions are viewed daily on Youtube. It's stunning

Speaker 1:          00:07:13       the, there, um, there's so much. I mean, we're at the beginning of this. I don't wait because I mean there's a long way for this to run a long way for the censorship to run the long. You can't help thinking among other things that the people trying to make the rules at the moment have no idea of the fact that these debates have happened before. Well, have not bothered to look into them and seem to think that history started with them. And I just wish that among other things with social media, people realized w we have been through this several times before at least, and the lessons are pretty clear, are not that you can limit speech in order to obtain political nirvana, for instance, a. nor are they, that you can simply use, I say, for short term gain accusations, you know, to be wrong. Right? In order to further a short term political goal, uh, we know all this. We've been through a printing press. We went through with John Stuart Mill. We went through it with Milton. I just wish these people had any idea of the fact that history started before the parents can see them.

Speaker 2:          00:08:22       Well, it's such that the whole culture of tech today is such a progressive thought bubble. It's, it's an echo chamber and it's very, very hard. I, like I said, it's better that they're really progressive and open minded and left Wayne and radical right wing. I think it's better.

Speaker 1:          00:08:41       Yeah. No, I agree. I mean, if by radical right wing you mean. Yeah, of course. Although these people have all, as I say, all the ability to create those people, right? Um, which is power it empower them, which is something you don't want actual racists and Nazis to have legitimate grievance claims and you don't want them to be able to disguise themselves as something they're not. So I say I had a friend who, um, a lot of friends involved in the Northern Ireland conflict in many years ago in the UK and all that many years ago, one writer had a beautiful phrase about w w where you've got the stage wherever I was killing everyone. He said you also got to the stage where truth was whatever you were having yourself. And um, we're not far away from that. That place where I say what you call is hate speech. You see what I say is hate speech. Let's call the whole thing off. We're not very far away from that actually.

Speaker 2:          00:09:45       Yeah. It's, uh, it's very strange that this, uh, this echo chamber is being so reinforced and that very few people are stepping out and saying, well, wait, let's take a look at this. Subjectively know the people that do do that are signaled out as being racist or sexist or homophobic or transphobic or what, you know, fill in the blank. Whatever is convenient.

Speaker 1:          00:10:06       Yeah. And it, but it's not surprising that more people don't want to stick their heads up. That's perfect because I mean, if you had a normal job, uh, you worked in a normal office or sharp or something, you, you really don't want this coming towards you, right? Um, I, I mean this, this can tear apart and tear down people who spend a lifetime demonstrating they are not the thing that they're being accused of. So if nobody knows anything about you, you have no particular persona out there, you have no particular back record. You don't want this and coming to tell your life down, right? Because recovering from that accusation is almost impossible and will take you wherever it is basically impossible. And all that you do along the way is to keep reminding people of the charge. And if you were to ever win on a technicality, like everyone would have forgotten the, Oh yeah, that's the, uh, that's the racist. That's the rapist. I mean he was pro rape, isn't remember him. Yeah, it's so simple, but it's.

Speaker 2:          00:11:05       I feel like we're in some strange adolescent stage of communication and there's been a bunch of talk lately. There's. There were some something that I tweeted earlier today, some new technology that they believe were ai is going to allow people to literally see other people's thoughts. Right and I am forever optimistic but also terrified and my feeling is that our transition from language, here it is, new ai system can see what you are thinking, which is just what the hell does that mean? I'm I'm concern, but also optimistic. I feel like we're in this transitionary period from regular communication to written communication, to written communication on line

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       two, speech online, video online where there's this instant access to all this and these ideas are being debated and tossed around like beach balls in real time and ideas are being distorted. People's positions are being distorted for for other people's gains and that there is this willful misuse of the truth and that something is going to come along that's going to combat that, but at what price? I mean the. I can't see what would come along to do it other than people rebelling against it. Their own free will as it was. It doesn't seem like that's happening though. It seems like there's a few people that are rec like yourself and there's many others that are recognizing the problem with this. There's people talking about the problem of it online, but for the most part the mass of people are engaged in this and it's also it's idea sport.

Speaker 3:          00:12:48       There's idea sport going on where their side, they want their side to score. Sure, sure. Well, that's always old politics and your country at any rate at the moment is how can we make sure that the other side trips up on this, and I've felt this, I've written this all through the me, an era that in your country and their mind, people are basically are willing to go for somebody who is a political opponent who does something very minimal and they're willing to defend somebody on the inside who does something bigger and you can see it all the time. It just. There are different standards that apply to your own side then apply to the other and people don't seem to be hiding it very much anymore. Not at all and they really don't have the ability to hide it. No. We had a case recently in the UK where somebody who was a great heritage of the left full sorts of complicated reasons was accused of some fairly.

Speaker 3:          00:13:43       I'm very serious, groping accusations about how this and exactly the left wing MPs who had been claiming that somebody who had sent out a tweet about a woman's breasts in 2009 should never hold any role in public, said that this person who just happened to be a friend and an icon of theirs was a changed man and we have to recognize this. Eighteen months ago now, and my favorite video on this was a. There was a guy who is a some rigid religious Christian man on television and he was talking about trump and he was talking about who trump was before he became president. He goes, but I don't know about you, but I've found Jesus and I did not have a past put praise Jesus and he's saying this and everyone's cheering. He, whoever he was before he found Jesus side as if trump got into office. It was like, you know what? I'm a new man. I found Jesus. I got the Jesus passed all that stuff that I did the last 70 years. Well, some people, some people do treat that as a journalist. Malcolm muggeridge very distinguished figure in the media, um, some years ago, but

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       who it was often noted that his, he converted to Catholicism and he, uh, a mutual friend once said that it was noticeable. Malcolm muggeridge always attacked advice immediately after he had become incapable of it himself when it was clear the mortgage didn't have as much sex as he did fairly often in his youth. Sex was a big problem.

Speaker 3:          00:15:15       It's a giant problem. He needs to let everybody know. Yeah, virtue signaling to the highest degree. Let everybody know this is awful. All that pleasure and flesh stop it. I wouldn't have it. I had a lot of it, but I won't have it anymore. Not In my bedroom. It's just, I don't know, man. I'm just, I'm hopeful. I'm hopeful that we're gonna work through this. But um, I'm also disturbed because no one's at the wheel. There's, there's no particular logical human being that's out at the wheel that has a real rational sort of a solution for all of these issues. It's just chaos. And in funding, the

Speaker 1:          00:15:56       problem is, again, it comes back to thinking about the truth being whatever you're having yourself. We don't have any one that we might mutually agree on some kind of empire. I mean, that's, that's becoming, that's becoming part of the problem. Who, who, who. I mean, I'd be very suspicious of any empire put forward, but, but where would you roughly look for one? I'm a, I like to think that truth is still massive, but you know, when you discover that a lot of people don't seem to particularly care for it or willing to sacrifice it, as I say for some other purpose, including winning a goal. Um, it's hard to see how you could adjudicate in this era, but just one of the photos in it, which is a lot of this has to do with whether or not the online world can forgive. This seems to me to be a really central thing. One of the, one of the things that came up the case I said recently about this 2009 cases, somebody in Britain who tweeted about a woman's breasts, among other things was he mistook twitter for a conversation with friends.

Speaker 1:          00:17:01       And how did he do that? You know, I mean, he's in public office and a journalist and a, but was, was going to get a public office anyhow, but the point is, is that, uh, you know, we don't really know what the rules are that are. I mean like what if you were a bit of a Dick 10 years ago like that on a medium that people were still finding their way on and now you are genuinely, you moved on kids and, and yet the, the breast tweet is always with you. I mean, it's a sort of dystopian nightmare that you'd always be stuck with your worst joke. You'd be stuck with your lowest sort of crisis moment recently with Bill Maher, right? Bill Maher,

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       there was something that he wrote, I think in 1989. Right? Which is insane. I mean, 29 years ago he wrote something and uh, people used it recently against him in 29. I don't know how old billy is, I don't think bill is even 60, so we're talking about something that he wrote when he was in his twenties and he was a struggling standup comedian.

Speaker 1:          00:18:13       The, uh, the, the, the, the is very good for this, isn't it? Because you can, you can, you can dig up everyone. Everyone's made. Everyone is. Everyone's screwed up from you, you know, apart from yourself. It's a w. We had somebody recently in Burton who, who ever wanted to go for suddenly and they found an article he had written about saying he didn't agree with Holocaust denial laws. Okay. He said, he said, he said he just thought it was a bad idea for free speech, you know, uh, when the, when the Internet was a second story to find out other stuff about it and they found an article which said, I'm a Holocaust denier, so, you know, prosecute me sorta thing, which he isn't a Holocaust denier. It's just nobody bothered to read beneath the headline and say suddenly in the middle of the thing, wherever I was telling about his life, they also said Andy's a Holocaust denier, and that was, that was that. And unlike something he wrote 15 years ago and it wasn't even an event, it's a headline or something. Uh, and yeah, and everyone. And again, nobody cares. Get onto the next victim. Uh, everyone's a Nazi.

Speaker 2:          00:19:19       It's almost like people, I mean, it's obviously the case of living glasshouses and throwing tons of rocks, but it's almost like everyone is just trying to throw as many rocks as they can before rock start coming their way because they know it's inevitable.

Speaker 1:          00:19:31       Well, I thought I felt until February the object of life in the modern era was to prove everyone else was a racist Nazi, misogynistic, transphobic. And then you win is somehow coronation or something. Everyone would say, oh, you're the person who's good, but now, yes. It seems everyone is aware that it's, it's, it's a Mexican gunfight.

Speaker 2:          00:19:57       Yeah. I have a friend of mine who had been on this podcast before, back when he was a radical lefties, name's Jamie Kilstein, and he's a stand up comedian and he was a real radical social justice warrior, male feminists, lefty, and they turned on him radical. What did they do horribly at? Well, they found out he was trying to have sex with girls. That can be another one and it was all. It was just having sex. That was it. He, he, he, he didn't rape anybody who didn't grow up. Anybody. He just, he threw some passes and less passes are 100 percent successful? Yes. Yeah. Oh yeah. The same exact paths could be your future wife. Right. And this one just felt 15 yards short. There's no room for error, but he, he took long time off of social media in a long time off of performing and these.

Speaker 2:          00:20:51       He came on and was really brave about it and he talked about who we used to be and he said he was in this frantic state where he was just constantly attacking people, just attacking people and then checking his twitter or see who responded to that attack and where people are on his side, you know, are people agreeing with him as he getting those social justice points that he wanted and he was really honest about the feeling that he got the Ang anxiety that I think a lot of people engage in on a daily basis. A lot of. If you go to people, there's quite a few people that I follow that seem to just always be in conflict and I just go to watch. I'll just go to their page almost like I'm watching a fistfight in the backyard and they're just. It seems like there's this. They're addicted to this constant seesaw of emotions and this interaction.

Speaker 1:          00:21:37       It is. It releases the necessarily chemical in the brain. They get, they get upset when they step away from it for a bit. I don't engage in any of that, that bit of it because I've seen suddenly a lot of the most mediocre minds of my generation brought low by this. I mean there are some people who I admired until I followed them on social media and, and now I just think, you know, your, the shouty angry person who's, who's, who's like a drunk at closing time, desperate, flailing around with your fists are looking for somebody to fight with them. And, and to what end, you know, the other, another experience I had, I've had in recent years that led me to not want to engage in this is walking around in various events in sort of breakout things. You people who, you know, really people I've admired in the past all saying things like, you see that, you see I flame decks on twitter.

Speaker 1:          00:22:35       I do see what I tweeted about that person. I think these used to be serious people in these used to be serious. People engaged in serious things and here they are engaged in these for flailing fistfights and often, often let's face it on things. Which if you didn't do it like that, seeking out the fight or the sort of thing that would allow for normal human interaction. I mean, how many disagreements do we have with people in our personal lives all the time? If we wanted to write, you didn't vote this way, that way. I mean some people would mind about that, but you know, I know you've, you think slightly differently for me on this particular issue, you don't say let's have that out now once and for all you, um, you, you find ways to live with people's differences and different opinions and you're not going to get everyone exactly in line. I mean, we all knew that before the age of social media and now it seems to be the only aim. What do you think that is?

Speaker 2:          00:23:34       I mean, think it's what we were discussing earlier, that it's idea of sport and then you just get caught up in like someone volleyed your way and so you have to smash that tennis ball back their way.

Speaker 1:          00:23:42       It is something like that. I mean, I, I can't say I haven't felt the vicarious pleasure of some of that myself. You know, that old Chinese proverb about I'm sitting by the river watching the bodies of your enemies float by. I had a big sense of that the other day when somebody I deeply disliked came across her on social media at the same time as somebody else I deeply disliked was being held by the French police on serious charges. And I thought that was, I felt like the Chinese proverb. That's all right. And so I can, I can see why people feel it. Sure. And of course people who they could never normally get to who they've got to. I mean, I think that's, I think that's the big, uh, the big thing of, you know, look, I poked that. You know what? I never engaged on social media for precisely that reason, that reason among others that you would never, I would never want somebody to know that they could get to me.

Speaker 1:          00:24:39       Even if they, even if you just block them, there's many people who take pride. Even in their heading. They say, I am blocked on twitter by all these people and, and actually I do sometimes read what people say is sending to me. Um, and I've never blocked anyone because I sort of thing you should mind that if you put your ideas out there, you might as well be as open as possible to receiving them back some time ago when I got into a car with the, with the Turkish president about, uh, about something, uh, I got all these Turkish, uh, uh, sort of accounts sending me stuff. There's one guy, he just repeatedly sent me a pornography of animals having sex with. So I didn't know it is, it's very, it was very hardcore. And um, and so I used to go down the feet.

Speaker 1:          00:25:20       Now that gun I didn't even block in actually because I sort of thought, well, somewhere in Turkey, he's a really angry man, desperately finding horse pornography send to me. And in a way I felt so sorry for him that that was how his life had come up with the end. His life had come to at this stage that I, I couldn't even block him. And also he'd be like, I'm the donkey porn guy who got blocked by dark. He'd get a certain thing. What was his motivation for sending you this stuff? He, I, um, it was because, well, the short story is a couple of years ago with the Turkey's president tried to get the German chancellor to imprison a German comic for a very rude poem he'd read on air on German television that was insulting about the Turkish president. And the German authorities actually started a case against the comedian for insulting the Turkish president, Edwin.

Speaker 1:          00:26:20       And uh, I, uh, decided to launch a, a, a, an offensive poetry competition to offend the Turkish president. And there was a thousand pounds cash prize and it sort of took off. And in the end, the now foreign secretary entered in one. Yes. That's great. Yes, it was really good because at the same time that the Germans were looking at imprisoning a comedian, uh, the, the now foreign secretary, the UK was guilty of precisely the same alleged crime. I eman, it wasn't a crime, it couldn't be a crime. A couple other people did. Wonderful Dutch comedian friend, Hans Johnson, or sort of a similar thing that time he decided to do an interview live on Dutch television, explaining how much he hated him because he still owed him money from the blowjob. He'd given Edwin in a sauna and the Dutch authorities were looking at. Actually we're looking at.

Speaker 1:          00:27:18       They were asked if they would prosecute him, but anyhow, but this was, this was, I had a great time with this of course, and I wrote a limerick explaining how I'm abusive. I wanted people to be about Edwin, that it wasn't necessary to be highly defamatory and you wouldn't get away with it if you just called him a banker or something. So I wrote the opening verse and invited the world to contribute, which they did and it became, among other things, the highest paid poetry competition in the world. If, if like me, you read a Limerick, just five lines, 200 pounds a light. And I mean, no, no. A poetry, a magazine could pave for such a, uh, such such work. So anyhow, on the basis of that, I became very, very unpopular in Turkey. And there were many, many pieces talking about how this gay atheist, terrible Edwin Hater in Britain was exactly what we're up against. So him and his poems.

Speaker 1:          00:28:13       Oh my God. Wow. Yeah. So the German government was actually considering. Yes. Prosecuting this guy. How far did they take it? Uh, he was taken in for questioning. I know he had to retain lawyers. I'm fairly sure they did only drop it in the end because of the international attention that was paid to it. There was this easy, there was this law on the books. It's still set. It was less imagine stay Lord about defending foreign rulers. And he had, he had done it for such an important reason as well, which was to say, you know, we in Germany should have the right to be rude about Edward, particularly Edwin, who you know, was promoted for Matt to Prime Minister. Now the president wants to be so tired, you know, I mean, it is a very bad man. Locked up more journalists per capita, I think, than any other country in the world other than China, which I don't think we can get the stats on a very, very evil.

Speaker 1:          00:29:07       I think man who, who has led his country backwards in the last 20 years and this is in the process of trying to destroy a wonderful country and if you can't be rude about him, if you can't pretend that he sleeps with animals, um, which is what the German comedian started with, then somewhere down the line you might be able to say anything about the imprisoned journalists either and so on. And, um, since also by the way, people don't seem to spend my time worrying about the Turkish journalist Edwin in prisons. I'm the least. They paid attention when I said that. Uh, he and Angela Merkel got up to really filthy filthy acts in the zoo.

Speaker 2:          00:29:51       Well, obviously the worst case of retaliation for humor. It's probably Charlie Updo, right? I mean, which is a terrible. And unfortunately many people weren't defending the murder, but we're talking the murderers. I mean, I think how many. I think it was 11 people were murdered and ended up placing a police officer, um, they, but they were saying that instead of concentrating on the murder, which was done completely out of this, reinforcing their rules of their ideology and in retaliation for any mocking of that ideology, instead of that, they were talking about how racist Charlie Hebdo was. There was a lot of that. In fact, my friend Jamie Kilstein was a part of that. He was on television back in his super social justice warrior days. Talking about that you wish you might have other things that people said, no, I'm not talking about something if they don't know about it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:30:51       In my guess was that until, until the murders, I mean an infinitely small number of people knew about Shaadi Abdo outside of France. I found myself in the wake of that in studios with people who I know how to just googled Charlene's up there the day before. I know that they just gone to wikipedia and read an English version of a claim about what that magazine was about. Goes back to my point about the journalist in the Holocaust denial thing that you just root around a bunch of people being killed. This doesn't seem to vindicate my sides ideology. Therefore, let me find what I can do to defame them and. Oh good. Somebody. Charlene Abdo once did this cartoon that was off color and I can't understand what the words are beneath it, but I'll, I'll claim it's racist to me. People were actually doing that. They're actually, there were, there was a, um, there was one cartoon that was used against Charlie Hebdo after the massacre.

Speaker 1:          00:31:48       Uh, that was a joke against the front nasional and the claims they were making about the black woman in Sarcozi government. But because the joke and the rich, if you didn't speak French, it wasn't clear. It apparently, but it. And if you knew nothing about recent French history, you knew nothing about the social, the Sarcozi administration and, and the, and the ministry in question. These people just went to it and said racist cartoon. Not Noticing that the cartoon was actually a joke about racists, but they didn't. They didn't bother to find that out. And I thought that I thought that whole thing among many, many other things was deeply worrying from that point of view because it means that in the immediate aftermath of something that should be so damn clear, a bunch of people can just try to reframe the narrative. Yeah. And really change the history of a publication. Yeah. Um, claim it is just something different. And, and for a lot of people, of course that was very, um, that was very convenient because after all, if Charlie, his staff actually were these racists, then you know, you didn't need to worry too much about them or why you'd been silent on the issues they've spoken up about.

Speaker 2:          00:33:05       Yeah. The narrative then been that these people had been mocking this disenfranchised marginalized group in society and that they had it coming in some very strange way. And it's part of me struggled with that because I was like, is this, some people just have contrarion instincts. Everybody's going left. They just go, I don't like it. And they want to go the other way. There's so many people that have that instinct. And then there's, as you said before, this headline mentality, they read the headline and don't look any further into it. Even if it's a headline about a headline, it's theirs. That's all they need. They're armed with enough facts. They slam their laptop down and start debating.

Speaker 1:          00:33:46       Yeah. And in that case, as in many others, totally lose sight of the only thing that matters. The only thing that matters in that case being, is it ever right to make apologies for people walking into an office and gunning down people for an opinion. You don't like the honest, which has to be, of course no. Has to be, has to be now. And yet in these moments. So we had 1:20 years before with the rush, dfs, the satanic verses. If in these moments you discover that you don't have the allies on your side, you thought you did in the wake of the rush, tfl and 89, it was people from the right and the left in Britain who started making excuses for the ayatollah in, uh, uh, we had, uh, the, the chief rabbi of the UK Djokovics to his, to his shame, said both Mr Rusty and vio taller has offended people's feelings as if someone had in, in, you know, called on all novelists to go to Tehran, assassinate the ayatollah if they had a chance.

Speaker 1:          00:34:56       You had a, um, somebody like a right wing conservative minister, uh, Jeffery Howe who said that said that overall she had done, had really offended Britain. He'd been rude about Britain as if that had anything to do with anything. Um, there was uh, one, um, there was one famous case of a, of a conservative peer who said about Rushdie that he wouldn't bother him if a group of young Muslims took Mr Roche into an alleyway and taught him some manners. And so, and you had that from the left as well. Bernie, granted, Labour MP famously said at that point the burning books wasn't a problem for him. Um, and uh, that was when they were burning the satanic verses in Bradford, so, so you get these weird coalitions of people who suddenly turned out not to get the point, not to get the point, not want to defend, and then of course you get the cowards to say things like, well, it wasn't my sort of novel, you know, I, I didn't think novel was all that good. I midnight's children, I could cope with static versus he lost me with a plot as if that means that then you can call for the death of the author rather than just give it a bad review.

Speaker 2:          00:36:02       How is he now? Salman Rushdie still in hiding. I know he does a lot of interviews now and it seems to be more relaxed.

Speaker 1:          00:36:09       Yes. He seems to be, I don't know the specifics. He, um, there was an assurance, I think given some years ago in the labor year Labor government, the width Tehran, that they would not actively, uh, um, uh, encourage the murder of rushed anymore. Um, how nice. Nice icer them, that's a freezing and unfreezing relations, uh, but, but the point I wanted to make was it, that's again, we've all, we've been through these things. We know how it plays out with the Charlie Hebdo, uh, events, the murder of the staff and contributors to that magazine. We knew in the immediate aftermath what was going on and that, that there were people who just wanted to make excuses and you still hear that everywhere. I mean, I, I've heard it on every single free speech debate in my adult life. Um, I remember growing up and I remember in every one of the things in recent years from the Danish cartoons to the Julia Medina scandal, a publisher London's firebombed for publishing a novel.

Speaker 1:          00:37:21       It was actually amazingly phoning about Mohammed, uh, to charlene abdomen since you, you just get these, this strange group of people from brightened left some believers and nonbelievers who always just come up with these bullshit bullshit arguments and say things like, well, I didn't find the cartoon very funny. Or, or I never, I never took that magazine seriously awhile. I didn't think it was right when they did this and it just, they just don't, for some reason have the fortitude to just say the only thing that matters in the wake of that, which is no.

Speaker 2:          00:37:57       Do you think that's because Islam is unique in their approach to anything that goes outside the lines of what they feel is. Oh, absolutely acceptable in terms of like they will murder you if you draw Muhammad. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:38:12       This is, this is, this is what's been described as the internalization of the fat. Um, if, if, uh, I'm sure you've had this experience, but it's actually worse now, the presumption is worse than the actual reality. I have quite often people say to me now, I'd like to write this piece about Hex, but I don't know if I can because you know, it might get a death sentence. And actually I always say, what are you talking about? Right. It fortunately, so far I haven't given that advice in the person's him being in any way under any actual danger lambien killed. Right? But, and I think I might feel differently if that was the case. Um, but, uh, but that, but there is this, an overcompensation occurring at the moment and it goes far, far within the, within the boundaries of what actually could plausibly get you into any trouble whether or not the trouble is, you know, legitimate to get into or not.

Speaker 1:          00:39:10       Um, so that now, yeah, I've had many journalists in recent years, particularly since shiny objects will sidle up to me and say, well, I'd quite like to do this for, I don't, I don't dare. And, and you know, I mean I'm talking about for like very basic reporting and things that they're not people saying, hey, I decided to draw a great big cartoon of Mohammed with a great big dick. And uh, you know, uh, having sex with the pope or something. You know, it's not that, it's never that. It's never people saying, I'm really just so keen to draw Mohammed today. Douglas, what did I do? It never is that. It's always something way, way, way down. I'm thinking of even like saying something critical if sense and regimes. So, so the internalization of the fat ones since 1989, which has been exacerbated now by the killings, the Charlie Hebdo and as well the attacks on the unit as Boston in Denmark means that we are in this period where, where people are really hyper hypersensitive and they really shouldn't be because it really isn't that bad.

Speaker 1:          00:40:12       It's not as bad as they think. But this is, you know, you can do so much work if you, if you say to people, I've got Kalashnikovs on my side, I mean the extent and people in free societies. I got really, really loathe to admit this, but it's the classic is a classic sort of a mob trek, you know, knocking on someone's door. I'm very disappointed in you, but my friend, my huge friend, uh, is a, is a really angry and I'm just holding him back. You can do an amazing amount of work if you're willing to pull that trick. And if you can persuade people and it's actually the case that there are people you're holding back, that you can make enormous inroads like that. Well,

Speaker 3:          00:41:00       especially when there's actual evidence that people have been murdered and happened. Absolutely. One of the more fascinating things about Charlie Hebdo to me was the refusal of any of the mainstream media to show any of the cartoons. Yes. You had to go online and I felt like this was a. They gave up the reins of information to the Internet when it was, was a real transitionary moment in our culture. Yes. Everyone went online to see what. Yeah, the only place to go pump from your parents, you know, they were still under the impression that these must be incredibly pornographic cartoons that were really viciously attacking

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       somebody. But no, most anyone young can. I could find this out for themselves. And you're right, they, they, they gave up the, uh, the space to the net and they all, they all had, again, these sort of rubbishy I arguments that their own about it. I tried in Britain to, uh, get the press to do it at one go and a couple of days after the massacre and, um, got pretty close, uh, that if everyone's there. So I am spartacus tactic. If everyone did it at once, then it'll be okay, but it would make it easier and the argument you always get about that is, and is a very persuasive argument, is that the editor of the magazine or newspaper might get protection. So, but you know, a girl from the typing pool sort of thing and the, which is what happened actually in some of the satanic verses, killings, stabbings and things like the Norwegian translate with Japanese translator, you know, it's people who under no security protocol could possibly end up or getting protected. Uh, and, and on the basis of fearing that the boss who almost always says no,

Speaker 3:          00:42:47       one of the more uniquely American responses to the Charlie Hebdo attack was they had a drama Mohammed contest in Texas. Yes, I followed that. Yeah. That was fascinating. And some guy showed up and started shooting at the building and they were killed almost immediately. Yes. Which is because they're in Texas and that's just not the place to fuck around.

Speaker 1:          00:43:09       Although, I mean, it's worth mentioning with, I mean the, the, the editor at Charlie Hebdo had police protection in Paris and they just, I mean, I suppose they were not worth dwelling or better than the, they, uh, the, the, the battle trained people who were sent from Yemen to carry out that operation. We just were better prepared than the French authorities realized. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:43:34       very few people are really ready to militarize cartoonist offices. And that's really almost what you would have to do. You would have to have navy seals of bulletproof vests. Yes. And then packed and loaded.

Speaker 1:          00:43:47       And then let's face it, I mean, the whole thing. Then you do start to question, you know, like, well, is this cartoon that funny? So. Yeah. And that's what they actually have done it. You have, they have, they did a little while ago, say, look, we're not gonna keep doing this. Well, didn't they have

Speaker 3:          00:44:02       Mohammed making out with someone like, almost

Speaker 1:          00:44:05       immediately after. That's right. Yeah. But after about a year or so, they, the, they stopped. They said they didn't want to do Mohammed again. And, uh, and uh, and you can't blame them. I mean, this is the thing, isn't that a, I'm sure you have this experience in these sorts of time. I, I always get people on the, apart from the Turkish donkey porn guy, other people on twitter send me things like, you know, well, why don't you draw Mohammed sort of stuff. Sure. And first of all, I mean I'm, I'm, I'm not a cartoonist, but secondly, the way in which this is always presented is amazing because it's always fun. Like Xena, Warrior, Princess Twelve, 93, you don't have the guts to draw Mohammed Mary and you know, like, well you don't even know the guts of your own name on twitter mate. So, uh, uh, but, but there's, there's a bit of, of egging along. What happens in those cases?

Speaker 2:          00:44:59       I don't want to draw Mohammed, I don't want to Piss people off by drawing the cartoon. But what I do want to point out is that you, if you, if you don't defend people's rights to draw things without getting murdered. Yes. And you're living in an insane society. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:15       And, and the, there's another thing we said, we all know what comes next. I mean, my point about this has always been think of something smaller than a cartoon to do, right? I mean, I still reserve the right to be amazed. We call something a cartoon crisis and keep a straight face. You know, we're going to have to militarize in Garland, Texas because there's a cartoon crisis. Well known

Speaker 2:          00:45:37       natural progression could easily be your. You're not allowed to draw the cartoon. Then from there you're not allowed to speak of drawing. And then from there you have to show that you have a very certain idea in your head of what is good and one is bad. So you have to show that by verbalizing something. So you're forced to forced to verbalize something.

Speaker 1:          00:45:59       And let's face it, it's not as if it's just the cartoon. That's the problem is it? I mean, it's a novel, it's short, so on and so forth. Sandy phone. And that's one of my big beefs about this is that a, I don't want to not say what I think is true and even if that does offend, you know, one point three or 4 billion people, it is often said and tones that are not entirely unthreatening. Uh, if, if, uh, Charlie Hebdo or somebody else can't draw a cartoon of Muhammad and then I know that exactly in tandem with that is somebody saying, and you douglas or you, Joe, you, anyone else can say what you find in the texts or what you think about this religion and you can join the rest of, uh, of the society and being brave and going to the book of Mormon on a Friday night for a laugh is a laugh. But don't you dare think of applying to Islam the same kind of speech you would apply to mormonism. And that, that I, that I won't do, I just, I just weren't joining in on that. And um, despite there being a price to pay for that, but I just wouldn't not say what I think is true in these matters.

Speaker 2:          00:47:16       Are you aware of what they did with South Park? With South Park South Park? It got very crazy were they not only could not draw Muhammad, they couldn't draw Muhammad in a bear suit, so then they have Mohammed in a bear suit in an armored car, so you couldn't even see him, but it was implied that Muhammad was inside the armored car in a bear suit and it's still.

Speaker 1:          00:47:43       But they did my homies voice, didn't they? Yeah, they. They gave him a screwy voice. Great Voice. So that was a kid. As long as you joke about the voice of Muhammad, you okay, but don't you dare show him. It's fucking insane. It's really weird as well because again, they all make presumptions. It's just not true. It's not true that nobody ever drew Mohammed. It's not true. There are illustrations in books that are still on sale of very old illustrations Mohammed through throughout Islamic history. That's before they knew better, bro. Didn't know better, but got a new note from Mohammed. Mohammed is like, look, I don't like these fucking drawings. Me and not about killing people. They don't show my best side, and this is, this is, this is a very strange position to be in because South Park ends up holding the line. Then south park, it's like fat tire against South Bucket.

Speaker 1:          00:48:35       What? I didn't see that headline coming. Um, and again, everyone internalizes it and everyone thinks, well, you know, I, I, I admire them in the Mormon work, but I wouldn't follow them. And then Mohammed works. So, and then the whole culture tilts it. Um, and that's, that's I think where we are at the moment on this. And I, uh, I just, you know, the cartoon will never be funny enough. The joke will never be funny enough. A novel will never be good enough and so on. And, and then in the end the speech will never be worth speaking enough. I, I, a little while ago had a very clear experience of this. I read about it on the radio in Britain where I was in discussion with a Muslim cleric who was sort of reformist figuring meyer in some ways who in a discussion about something said, well, you know, also Muhammad Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.

Speaker 1:          00:49:27       Was, was he took criticism in his and he took criticism very, very well. He never mind that. People criticizing him. I was like, that's absolute crap. That is real crap. I mean, whatever else you can say. He Mohammed not really good on this, on the criticism of himself bit. And I gave an example of a female protests who he had killed because she criticized him and this guy went absolutely ape shit and refused to continue and so on. And because you gave an actual historical example from his own religious texts and uh, and in the end it was a prerecorded CNN, the BBC, I can this, can you find another way of trying to make the same point and you know,

Speaker 2:          00:50:15       and, and that was what we had to do. Another way of making the same point rather than pointing out the historical pxe that showed that Mohammed did have a female poet killed. Yes. You just one other

Speaker 1:          00:50:27       way. Would there be to make that point? That is hard, but that's the ultimate way to make that point. Exactly. Which is by pointing to the texts and the facts. But you know, I can think of no other situation in which somebody has veto rights like that. Yeah. In a normal discussion. And it's because they are terrified of the retaliation. So, I mean, I knew everyone in the production box was like, oh no, what's Douglas Dunn? So how can we stop it affecting us? What was this clerics response to that he. Yeah, he, he, he, uh, went. Yeah, there's a bit nuts and wouldn't continue unless I wouldn't say that. And so what did he deny that it was? Oh yeah. I said I was making it up and I was a liar.

Speaker 1:          00:51:13       I'm used to that, but that, that's a crazy thing for him to say when someone could just read the text. Yeah. But they were banking on nobody doing that. Well, not this day and age. Don't bank on that. Yeah, I. This is. This is one of the releasing things, isn't it? Because although it's true, you can suppress a lot of this. You know, we do live in an age when basically anyone can google and find texts and they can just find a time that a billion people have read. I'm not sure they've read it, but yeah. Well possess it. How many people you think read it? How many people you think read the Bible? Like if you had like, guess there are a number of Christians in this country. All those tests aren't that they'd sometimes to the humanists sudden did a few years ago asking very basic questions of self professed Christians about their knowledge of the texts and very few. My favorite is self professed Christians with religious tattoos. Like, hey man, you got to read the whole book. Like you are literally showing on your skin that you didn't read the whole book. It didn't pay attention to don't do that.

Speaker 1:          00:52:21       This is Leviticus, leviticus. It says that it's got the implications against the writing. I say if you read limited, there's a heck of a lot you can't do. If you. If, if you go down Leviticus, I can't wear two pieces of different cloth. Yes, exactly. Yeah. Leviticus is a wonderful book. It's going to be. It's very good for them because what? The Vegas wasn't the one which was the book where the guy. I'm called upon the sheet bear to kill the children who were mocking his baldness. Do you know about that one? My favorite special bald guy. This guy was getting mocked by children fucking kids and God called upon a. She bear to come down and tear apart these children who were making fun of his bald head here. Oh, oh shit. And the to bear to kings. Yeah. Look at that. Wow. Went up to pat. If you are going to intervene in human affairs for anything, this would be the time when God's got to step in this kind of stuff. Going young kids,

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       young kids came out from the city and mocked him and said to him, go up you bald head. Go up you bald head, which is very mild, and when he looked behind him and saw them, he cursed them in the name of the Lord, all caps than two female bears came out of the woods and tore up 42 lads have their number and he went from there to Mount Carmel. It's like no big deal. It's over. Got It done. And that's, that's.

Speaker 1:          00:53:53       Yeah, that's my favorite reading from scripture was about the end of one of the books that come in. Which one? It was over the course when I was young and I always made me laugh if there was a destruction of the city of Nineveh. It finished, I think not any finish this chapter of the book, he says, you know, and, and low in that, in that city where

Speaker 3:          00:54:13       40,000 human souls that were destroyed and had also some cattle cattle just by association, some cattle, bad cows. There are bad cows. God had a fuck up those cows too. But no, the um, the bald headed one. That's, that's, that's uh, yeah, that's a heck of a time to, to tread into him to, in an insult, you know, had your bald head is just an accurate description. I mean that is not an insult. If you like, you ugly, sloppy, baldheaded loser. Okay. Then maybe God needs to step in and send some wolves to attack yet. And why do they specify that they're female? Yeah. Why is it female 30 to have that number? Yeah. Forty two kids. Two bears head. Those are some bitch ass kids need to learn how to run. That doesn't even make sense. How the fuck those bears even catch all 42 of those kids. What kind of kids they raised over there in Bethel. Alright. Shouldn't get the fuck out of there. Well, they're all sitting around waiting their turn mean trying out curse words to causes the best to come down you shaggy bear. That didn't work. You Shaggy. Mangy. Dirty, stinky, bare bulb. Yeah. There's so many of those stories that are so strange.

Speaker 1:          00:55:37       I bet. I bet that most, if we, if we were to go to the, the people who say that that question is in the polls and ask them about, we don't even need to go to the bolthead bad. They don't accept that. Most people don't even bother reading that because it's just, it's almost too crazy. Yeah. But, uh, but, uh, but I'm very, very little knowledge even about very basic things. Um, uh, you know, even commandments and so on. So that's the case with the religion that in America and Britain is known best with Christianity. So there's no reason to assume that that's not the case with Islam as well. Isn't

Speaker 3:          00:56:11       that just the case with people? I mean, it seems to be the same thing that we're talking about with headlines. Someone reads a headlines, they don't bother reading into it and then they accuse someone of something. It's almost like with religion, I'm a Christian and I'm a Christian man. Oh really? Please me about the Bible,

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       right?

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       Uh Huh.

Speaker 1:          00:56:27       Yeah. That's something I've often thought. This is one of the reasons why it's possible to get a sudden fanaticism going within Muslim communities on some issues to do with best for me is I think is to do with, uh, a realization of this. You said that this was the case about our prophet. I didn't know that. I know he did what I had all my adult life with, with, uh, arguing with Muslims about things the, they very rarely know for the problems in their own tradition. And when you bring them up, they're like, what the, what he did, what a, like the Christians with the bold bets. And this causes a really serious problem for them because they are told from the cradle that the, that they are following a religion founded by the most perfect man imaginable. And if you discover that, if you know there's no description of Helen, of troy in ancient text, why does nobody described handled? Why doesn't it reset the unit? She was so you had this beautiful blonde ringlets order is because it actually catches on as a, as a theme because everyone makes Helen of troy, their most beautiful woman. If you start describing, you'd be like, I'm not into red heads.

Speaker 1:          00:57:49       Everyone would write hello toy becomes a person upon whom you put all of those things and in the same way Mohammed becomes, if you say, is the perfect human being, people will just throw their lives, put the kinds of things they think are perfect onto Mohammed. You must have been very kind, very generous, very caregiving, and so on, so that if you then say, well, what about when he vented this? I think it just causes an extra hurt. This is something we'll have to get over, of course, because we can't go away and not identify these, these issues. Um, but it causes in the short term and enormous, enormous pain. I have an example I gave recently in a book of, um, somebody I spent some time with a couple years ago to extraordinary man called morten storm. Um, he was a Danish biker, a big in a biker gang in Denmark.

Speaker 1:          00:58:41       I went to prison and in prison about $2,000. So he converted to Islam. He converted to Al Qaeda. Basically. He's not a, not a common person in any way, and uh, he ended up being the main go to person for some of our luck. He was the head of al Qaeda in Yemen and in fact was asked to give him a, get a wife our lucky to supplement his wife collection and a modesto among other things, ended up falling out with our kid and ended up working for the CIA and Danish intelligence and ended up helping lead them to our lucky who was then droned by Obama in 2011 or so. Anyhow, I said to motor storm, what was the moment that made you get out of Al Qaeda? And he has such a fascinating on. So he, he, he came out of al Qaeda and Islam the same moment.

Speaker 1:          00:59:32       He says what was happening was he was sitting in his, he was waiting for a package when kind of drop off to get them from him to our lucky and the, the, the person carrying the package was late and then really late and he was sitting in his apartment somewhere in Germany I think at that point. And he was so pissed off about this and he had a laptop that was there on the table and he thought basically, how can I express my pissed off with my al Qaeda colleagues for wasting my time like this so much. And he went to Google and typed in contradictions in Islam and began to read.

Speaker 1:          01:00:13       Wow. That was how he got out. Wow. That's what did him in. Someone's being late. He just started reading again. They told me this, they never told me that. I never knew that. And that was. So. As I say, he's a very, very uncommon. But, but I think that might be happening quite a lot more than we know people. Just googling things, finding stuff out for themselves. It's the most dangerous route. Religion to leave because they kill apostates. I do. Yeah. So how is he dealing with that? Well, he, he lives in hidings. I mean. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:52       Yeah. We didn't see me. He wrote a book called agents dorm about it two years ago. One of the weirdest conversation that I ever saw anybody have with someone who is a believer was Dawkins. I think it was was having a conversation with someone and he asked him point blank whether or not he believed that Mohammed split the moon. Oh yes. I think I know this was with Vaco is enemy of mine called Media Hassan who worked for Al Jazeera and who Richard Dawkins did an interview with and I think he, that's why he fluffed something earlier on a dog is that he didn't take it on. Then he took him on this. That's right. And I think that Sun City, yes, yes, yes. And then it lead to this terrible problem which is really interesting and distinct problem of our era, which is then dog. He said, I can't believe that somebody or said afterwards, I can't believe that somebody can be a working journalist and believe that, you know, Mohammed slipped and half human horse. Right. Um, and of course, I mean that's an interesting point there, but of course we do quite rightly allow people to believe

Speaker 1:          01:02:01       bizarre and insane thing that Christianity was bizarre. Exactly. And if we started saying you can't have public office or work in journalism, if you profess to be of this particular then, but we wouldn't get anyway. We wouldn't have anyone left. And how does the story go? Mohammed flew to the moon on a half human horse and split the moon with a. is that what he did? I can't remember. He could have then been attacked by female beds, but I can't remember. No, I can't. Yes, he gets the night journey, which is a central. Has the moon get glued back together again? Is it glued back together? It looks like it is. I haven't looked close. Maybe I need to pay more attention to the fact that a, I, I believe this was a few years ago, let's just say it was 2010 that this interview or the debate took place around them eight years ago that someone would be comfortable saying, oh, that they believe that, oh, let me see.

Speaker 1:          01:02:56       I got into a little bit of trouble. Richard Dawkins got a bit annoyed about me, uh, because I took the mickey out of him for dodging the one earlier in that it was the earlier one. He, I'm a great admirer of Richard, uh, is everyone is sure. But, um, he, he knows exactly where the cliff edge is. And in that interview he, uh, he was asked on allergies era by this interview. He see read out the bit from the God delusion about, uh, as a great bit of rhetoric about the most, the swipes God is something like the most appalling, narcissistic, murderous, blah, blah, blah. Character in all of fiction is a terrific piece of writing. And the interviewer says to you, you, uh, you, you stand by. That was the description of the Christian. God says, yes. He says, use it as a description of the Jewish.

Speaker 1:          01:03:48       God says yes. Then he says, and what do you say? The same thing about the Muslim God. And I just knew exactly what's happening. And Richard Dawkins says about the Muslim God, I didn't know so much, which he, as I say, he, he, he, he, he thinks I shouldn't rip him on this. And the thing was, what I noticed was just, I just, I completely felt it's been very brave and brilliant writer and thinker on these matters and nobody's done more in some ways, but he, I knew exactly what was happening. He was staring right over the cliff edge and somebody was behind him, nudging and that if he had said, as it were, live on Al Jazeera, Oh yes, Allah, you know, the total bastard, then I, you know, you didn't know, maybe that's maybe your then in real trouble, you know. And so he stepped back from the brink and I rather cruelly perhaps taking the mickey out of him afterward.

Speaker 1:          01:04:45       I said that it was just the, Richard Dawkins was demonstrating the survival instinct of his species. But I feel bad about it, but it is true. It is true. But we've all been there to some extent. And what was his response to that though? To my junior criticism? He, um, well he basically, he, I think he did take it on board in a way, um, complex reasons, but I know, I know, I know he was also annoyed that I was where he, I think he felt that I was doing that to him. Then you do it right. Right, right. Um, and that is very common in that I've had that a lot in my life in this particular area of people trying to egg me over. Why don't you say that course and uh, and you know that they're the people who'll be a million miles behind you with their ears plugged.

Speaker 1:          01:05:41       Yeah. I behind a wall. I always have. I always have a very, very visual aid of era. Somebody who actually is, is a terrific reformer in Islam that now under another cleric who wants to describe me. He went to fight for the Mujahideen in Afghanistan and a study years ago now. And describe to me that he's not a very fittingly like person, but described how he did that to sort of rile them up to sort of run over and get at the Soviets. And he was like, you know, we're all agreed. Yes, yes. And I go and he worked 20 odd guys. Yeah. Isn't everyone else stayed in the trench? And I've always thought this is exactly the, uh, the experience of anyone. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:06:21       This area is that there's an inherent danger in this criticism. Even this discussion right now, I'm sure there's people right now firing up their webcams and writing blogs and tweeting and getting upset about it. It's awesome. Any rational discussion of that particular subject, you could kind of get away. I mean, I get criticism from Christians, but it's not scary,

Speaker 1:          01:06:46       right? Yes. That is, that, that is a big difference at the time doing isn't it? This is this just something that's so important to a nuance that almost never gets added in. But of course we all just assume it so we don't think it's worth saying, but we are aware that any religion or for like this could be this dangerous at different phases. Yes. Might've wanted to be in Spain in certain points in the last millennium. Sure. Um, we might not have, wanted to be a Catholic center at certain points or Protestant descend to others, and so on and so forth. We all know that, yes, it's just that at the moment that's pretty crescent and uh, and quiet. And of course it's less quiet here than it is in my country on condo. Imagine the Anglican church becoming militant about anything at any point soon. A, you do have some angry or types of Christian here than we have in my country. And so it's easy for me to think they're slightly less, uh, uh, risky at some point in the future than the new might. But, but it's just that we do recognize this could happen elsewhere as well. It just, at the moment it's, it's, it's not the quakers that they really don't send me a death threat from one year to the next rather nice people.

Speaker 2:          01:08:02       There is an inherent danger of a retaliation from people who are more radical Christian, that if this continues and if you see more and more of more and more attacks from people of Muslim faith, you could possibly see a retaliation from people. Especially in this country, like after nine slash 11, there was an extreme amount of, of hate for Muslims and irrational hate done. Nothing wrong to the Sikhs as I remember. Yes. Well, there was a lot of that out of ignorance. They just didn't. They didn't. I mean that was the most disturbing because Sikhs are pretty interesting people and the fact that they just instantaneously with no information at all, no understanding out of complete ignorance attack them.

Speaker 1:          01:08:51       Uh, I, I have a second to no one in my gloominess about some of the things that we're going to go through in Britain and Europe in the coming years. But I recently had a reason to even more gloomy about one aspect of it relating to this, which is this. We had a three big bad terrorist attacks last year in, uh, in the UK, including the Manchester Arena bomb. Twenty two young people were blown up on a Monday night for going to hear Ariana Grande Day. Um, and uh, after the third of those attacks, which was on London Bridge, when a three people who are actually known to authorities as they generally are a slash people's throats on the street and ran to borough market is people were drinking and stabbed. People are shouting. This is for Allah. After the third of those attacks, it was felt like, Oh God, is this really just got to keep happening?

Speaker 1:          01:09:47       What are we going to do about it and what can we do? And after the Manchester one in particular, there was this kind of thing of everyone saying, apart from John Lennon's imagine there was the oasis hit, don't look, don't look back in anger and these themes that we weren't meant to think anything other than that we weren't meant to be angry and went. And uh, then then just a terrible thing happened from another direction, uh, outside Finsbury Park mosque, which the muscular, very troubled and bad history in London. I'm a guy from Wales in a van, drives into the crowds as the milling around outside the mosque, kills one man and enjoys a number of others. Uh, that guy, by the way, just show how complex all this can get. His, uh, he was tried, found guilty last month in the courts in the UK. Uh, he, uh, he had been, he loves you very mentally deranged and had a history of mental illness and all that sort of thing is very often people do in these situations.

Speaker 1:          01:10:51       But he, uh, he had watched the BBC drama called three girls, which is a first time that the BBC had really addressed the issue of the rather than Rochdale rape gangs. That happened in the last decade in the UK, which is still a sore that's going on. We're about 1500 girls in one town alone. We're basically a abused by gangs, most of them, mainly Pakistani men, and it's a very, very ugly business partly because it was so awful that nobody that nobody at the state and the police level and he wanted to look into it. They are now the government inquiries that they didn't look into it so worried about being called racist and Islamophobia console. The press did a lot of not being interested in this as well. Eventually after all these years of BBC makes a documentary called three girls, about three of the girls who have suffered from these rape gangs and then a man in Wales sees it and get so enraged people say at the local pub he was railing against the bloody Muslims and all this sort of thing, and then he hires a van and drives into a crowd of people outside a mosque and you have this awful feeling that the BBC didn't want to deal with the issue that the program was about for years because it was so awful and ugly and sounded like something made up by some kind of nativist, racist, you know, it's, uh, it's had everything.

Speaker 1:          01:12:14       Um, and then they do. And then it turns out the member of the public sees it and drove the van into a crowd. I mean, you know, this, this sort of couldn't get more complex. And so I thought after that, okay, maybe, maybe the, maybe the BBC were right. Maybe they shouldn't. Maybe they should cover up the gangway per 1500 girls. Maybe the public can't cope with it. Maybe they will get into vans now as it happens. I know the British public, I think fairly well and I think that that guy in Wales a very, very unusual figure. I don't think it's very common. I don't think everyone's going to do that. I don't think we're all like that wicked mad, but I don't know. I mean, I don't know for sure everywhere. I don't know what the. I don't know what happened in this country. Have various other countries. If there were three attacks like that in quick succession, I don't know, but this is. This is really. It's just going to get complex is already complex

Speaker 2:          01:13:10       and the response to it, it's complex too. How do you, how do you, if you, if you are a journalist, if you are a television channel, how do you report on this? Do you think about the responsibility of alerting someone to these actual real atrocities? It's going to force them to react on innocent people that did nothing in front of this mosque and the fact that these people in this mosque or somehow or another connected to these people that did these horrible crimes just by virtue of the fact they're in the same religion. That's insane to. Yeah, it's all insane

Speaker 1:          01:13:43       to me. The only way through it is to say, first I read it, I can press all the time and I think that it's worse than the British press in, in, in that self appointed role of believing it's task is to stand between the public and the facts, you know, and sort of negotiate between the two, uh, see what they think the public can cope with or should know, and then feed them that I'm the American press teams to be rife with that. That temptation as ours is. But it seems to be the only way around this is to not, not given to that and to try just to publish the fact when they happen because it's just obviously seems to be much worse. We will know in political scandal what's worse, the cover up. It's always the cover up and that that may be the case with all of this. Maybe, maybe the, the argument for just the papers explaining stuff that's happened is maybe that's maybe that's all they can do and that it won't be just say to them it'd be a lot worse if you bottled this up because otherwise people will get the idea that there is some conspiracy to cover over certain stories and they'll be onto something.

Speaker 2:          01:14:53       In fact, if you think about the millions of people that must have seen that the story on the grape of 1500, the fact that only one person responded that way is pretty extraordinary in and of itself.

Speaker 1:          01:15:05       Yes, yes. I, I would've, I would've thought on some of this. I mean, you know, I don't know. Again, I mean there are, there are lots of examples aren't good use, but when something bad happens, like the Manchester Arena attack, uh, I'm, I'm amazed in a way that people are so decent. I mean, I'm so pleased they are, but they, we really, we don't go out looking for people to attack, you know, the, the, the public. Certainly in Britain I can happily send, I think it's the same in America public, but we were not really lynch mobs waiting to be got going again, but the expectation that we are, is there any possibility of creating us in such a way? Um, it's only by treating us as if we can't deal with ugly things that go on the, you could see the situations where he began to see the situation in which that all goes wrong in that different way.

Speaker 2:          01:16:01       Yeah. I mean I don't envy their position, especially trying to pick up the ball from here. Yes. With all the history and all the terrible things, especially in England with so many attacks over such a relatively short period of time where there was a very small history of that before. It seemed like this immediate eruption of all these issues.

Speaker 1:          01:16:22       Yes, the country in some ways I wrote about in my lates, but most is France where the book comes out in translation there and a couple of months time we're very interested to see what happens because France even, I mean we mentioned Charlie Hebdo, but that 18 months or so it had was just, I mean again, we'd all sort of disappeared now everyday he's got bad news of some kind, but you know, to have a um, a major western capital city with 130 people killed in an evening with multiple suicide bombings and people being gunned down from mopeds as they're sitting outside a bar and you know, another group of people going into a rock concert and you know, going through the disabled section, shooting everyone one by one in the disabled, actually catch them in the lavatories and shooting them. And I mean the, that happened in one night alone in Paris.

Speaker 1:          01:17:16       The Parisians didn't become, you know, they didn't become wicked terrible people or anything, but they have. I think these, I think that the, a lot of these terrible events that happening, they actually, what happens is they sink down to a lower level of our consciousness so that we, what actually happens is we, we, we get over the immediate thing quite fast, but something at the foundational level changes. I had a case nobody really wants to linger on, but there was one in November in the UK on Oxford Street wear because of course everyone does. After these attacks, they always say, you know, we will not be changed. Everyone tries to sort of channel the spirit of Churchill and all that sort of thing. Um, in church you'll hear me roar. And, and so and uh, and actually the, the facts are otherwise. In November on Oxford Street, there was, all we know is that there were two men who may have had some disagreement on the platform of a tube.

Speaker 1:          01:18:14       The tube platform, whatever happened, it was misunderstood by crowds and it developed into a stampede out of the tube station and all the way down Oxford street people were locked and barricaded into the big department stores. A, a pop singer called polymers, uh, tweeted out his million followers, you know, there are shots are being fired. I'm in the back room of the store, h and m and this sort of thing. And uh, other people claim that the truck had gone down. Oxford mowing people down, they've seen bodies. The police said it was a major terrorist event. They were on top of it. And the press were all, you know, running stories turned out nothing happened. Nothing happened. The next day, two men handled themselves into a local police station saying, I thought they might have been responsible for it, but they will let off without any charge. What I'm saying is

Speaker 2:          01:19:02       they thought they might be responsible for it because they had been in an,

Speaker 1:          01:19:05       they'd had an argument, maybe they, they weren't saying we're responsible, healthy, but like do they ask asking for information and they will let go. But the point is, is that is that we, we, we can simultaneously say we will not be cowed and also actually be at the stage where if you just hear a bang, everyone goes running

Speaker 2:          01:19:25       you, you don't want to be the last person to figure out what's going on.

Speaker 1:          01:19:30       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          01:19:30       So as soon as something you think is happening, people in this day and age when there's just this recent history of horrible things happening over and over again in Orlando here, I mean there's just so many of them that people just instantaneously want to react and then liking the vegas shooting. One of the things that was very confusing about the vegas shooting is people would go into casinos, they would flee from the concert into casinos and then talk about a shooter, and then people would say there's an active shooter at the Tropicana. There's an active choice.

Speaker 1:          01:20:03       That's why I never believed that immediate aftermath. There's a claim of other other shooters. There's always a claim or something that turns out not okay.

Speaker 2:          01:20:09       Everywhere there were, there were claiming your shooters all over the city, but there was no actual shooting in these other casinos who just reports of active shooter.

Speaker 1:          01:20:18       Yeah, and by the way, if you're interested, there's a fascinating thing about why this happens and I read a book some years ago about bloody Sunday, terrible event in Northern Ireland in 1972 and one of the things I went through all the tests that we have, everyone who has seen one of the most interesting things was the number of people whose memories, which is totally different from what we know actually happened and one of the conclusions I came to is that there's a book by Harvard professor, but the called the seven sins of memory about this. But one of the things that clearly happened is after one very traumatic event or have a terrible event where people are effectively in the situation of a war zone, when they were just shopping. The constantly moment before is that our memories immediately become even more suggestible than they are already.

Speaker 1:          01:21:07       And the most obvious thing of suggestibility in these situations is that the situation was, was worse around you and you came off better than you did. And that's almost always the case. Um, the, the, the shots that were quite, uh, quite a bit away, we're very close. Um, uh, you, you, you have your memory without knowing it, I will do it. Our memory tells us we behave better than we did and the threat was worse because this is our, one of our ways of coping I think. Um, but, but it's a terrible thing. And obviously with, I mean with these school shootings and things that are going on here at the moment. I mean, this is obviously one of the things I watched your podcast the other day where you were discussing it. So the latest one with the Florida and uh, and I think sort of in a way bafflement going on in this society about this is understandable.

Speaker 2:          01:22:04       Yeah. The, I mean, it's the unimaginable horror of being involved in that situation. Your mind is just not prepared to cope with that. I mean, maybe if you're a soldier and if you experienced combat and you know how to stay calm and a firefight because you've been in a bunch of them, but for the average person, I mean it's one of the reasons why I witness testimonies. One of the worst pieces of evidence you could ever get, including I mean, about it, about basically everything about fist fights, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:22:32       Oh yeah, no, I. We all have examples in our lives. I've seen friends who've been through the same thing. We know that they burned through the same thing and yet they have two totally different directions. Of course, you know what happened. I mean that's, that's a real problem, but now you have this thing here where, I mean in some ways even worse than we do have of the search to notch it up for your own political science or against the enemy. It's the same thing with a twitter, the twitter point, but the. I mean this, this obscene glee that goes on after any terrorist attack in Europe, but I think also here's what the attempt is to immediately call it for the other side or for your site or whatever and to to try to use terrible events as a way to justify whatever your team is. Yes, I have I find is amazing with the gun debate here and I would find it amazing coming from a different society on it, but the wages are not set up for one side or the other in it and it's. You've got a real

Speaker 2:          01:23:32       problem on this. I've been watching a lot of it from the perspective of the gun owners, NRA members and the people that want to defend the idea of having guns even of arming teachers and you're looking at their perspective on it and their perspective on it is all about their rights. All about the constitution, all about the bill of rights, all about protecting the second amendment, all about gun ownership being taken away, gun ownership, under attack, the NRA under attack. They're coming after our guns and this is this constant battle of ideas. It's on twitter, not addressing the actual issue.

Speaker 1:          01:24:10       Sorry. No, it's okay. It's to. I'm watching this thing. Arming teachers.

Speaker 2:          01:24:16       Yeah. That's insane. I mean, this is Samuel Jackson had a great quote about it, but you know, he uh, he put it on twitter. Like someone tell a motherfucker was never been in a gunfight. The problems of arming a bunch of teachers, right? Somebody that someone who's been in a gunfight, please tell.

Speaker 1:          01:24:33       Yeah. Motherfuckers, somebody. Somebody said, anyone who thinks is a good idea. Giving teachers guns as quitting. Never seen one. Try to use an overhead projector.

Speaker 2:          01:24:41       Yeah, there is. There Samuel Jackson. Look at that 306,000 likes. So, you know, it was an effective tweet. They, the world we're living in and he just checked the number. It wasn't like, yeah, you got three tweets. It can't be true. Nobody likes. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:24:55       I, I, I felt that was a very pertinent one a few years ago in New York on fifth when somebody shot their colleague and I'm outside the office, came back with a disgruntled worker, the Carnegie and uh, locally there were some policemen around the corner and they came out and started firing at the guy who'd done it, ended up wounding around 11 pedestrian like, well, you would, wouldn't you? Of course, I mean, I'm not saying by the way, but we have, we have our own problems, but I mean this is a big problem for America and what I can have more guns and we have people. I mean, I completely understand why the amendment exists and I think it's a very good idea for the time and I think it's a very understandable. I did hold onto it now, but, um, but why can't people say for instance, I mean, we all have abstract ideas we have to hold onto, but we were all in our countries have like weird things that other people don't understand. I mean, you might think it's odd to have a hereditary constitutional monarch for instance. And, uh, it, it is weird, it's a great way to put it. It didn't seem strange and uh, if you were starting from now, you might not do that. Um, uh, but, but clearly with the ownership thing, it is, we are willing to take bad things happening quite often because we want to hold onto

Speaker 2:          01:26:15       the second amendment. Well, the second amendment has been around forever. The bad things happening quite often is really from columbine on. I mean, there was a few of them before the, there was the Austin, Texas, uh, but, uh, tower shootings.

Speaker 1:          01:26:27       But it seems like, I mean, again, I mean just, it's such an obvious point. I don't want to sound like it was high. It's not a Brit who's saying something about America that's not at all welcomed, but it seems obvious that you just, you could do a lot more damage with a semiautomatic rifle than you can with a knife. And most people, we see this in the terrorism as well where there are really committed terrorists who don't commit acts of violence unless they can get hold of, uh, of, uh, the means to do it because we often think, well, why don't you just like go out with a knife? Some people do, but most people actually want to go out in that way and what they see as being a blaze of glory. Right? So they like stopping them. Having the means of getting that very easily.

Speaker 1:          01:27:13       Seems to me very obvious. But that isn't to say that. I mean, of course I think you made a point the other day and it's like saying if you say everyone who has a gun is part of promise and obviously not because it's like saying everyone who's got a truck is about the problem. But there is, there are obviously two things. One is the psychological and whatever the social issues are that caused this to keep happening and that, that is obviously very, very important to try to get to the root of. But you can get to the root of that or try to get through to that and also recognize that people having access to some of the weapons they have access to in this country must be a part of the problem problem

Speaker 2:          01:27:52       it has to be. And they're also the idea that you should just be able to go out and buy a gun without really understanding how a gun works at all. Yeah. And which is exactly how you do it. I got my first handgun license in 1994. That's when I bought my first hand gun and I just went and bought a handgun. But I did a background check on me. That's it. I mean I went to the range. They showed me what the safety is, pointed this, put the earphones on, make sure you don't blow yours out, Bang, Bang, Bang. And then you leave the gun. I mean, once your background checks clear, they find out you're not a criminal. There's not much to it. There's A. There's a giant problem with that. If you want to drive an automobile, you have to show that you understand the laws.

Speaker 2:          01:28:35       You have to understand, you have to sit with an expert was to sit there and driving instructor to have to go through it with you. They have to watch your movements. They have to watch you make turns. They wouldn't, wouldn't you imagine that it would be a good idea to have some sort of a clinical evaluation of a person that's gonna going to buy a gun, and here's another thing. There was an article recently that was saying contrary to popular belief, most school shootings not committed by people who are mentally ill will. That's a fucking stupid thing to say. You know why? Because if you're screaming, you're committing a school shooting, you're mentally ill. Okay, period. Then on top of that, what they're ignoring conveniently, and this is another headline thing, psychiatric medications, these people are almost entirely on some form of psychiatric medication, whether it is anti anxiety pills, whether it's antidepressants with there they are all. I'm not saying that correlation equals causation. I'm not saying that, but to say that they're not. This is just a bullshit, this is click bait headlines. They're mentally ill, 100 percent, 100 percent of them are mentally ill

Speaker 1:          01:29:43       as a conservative commentator in the UK called Peter Hitchens, who always makes a point after Islamist terrorist attacks in Europe that there's a large number of them as well as other types of attack who seemed to be on some kind of medication and my point is always I'm very, very happy to have that conversation. I think we need to have that conversation and we also have to have the other parts of it as well. Yes, so it's the same here. I can't see why we can't have all of this.

Speaker 2:          01:30:10       It's the same thing that we were talking about earlier. It's this idea of sports. These wars people don't want to give up their idea. They don't want to give up any ground whatsoever on their second amendment rights. Whether it's owning a 50 caliber fucking tank gun or whether it's having a gun for home safety or for hunting. They don't want to give up anything and they feel like it's a slippery slope. The people that I follow online that are tweeting about this on a regular basis and you can go to a lot of them like they're making videos about it. Dana Lash and Collin is actually, his name is collins, Cole Lion, colion noir and. Oh, I are. He's very, very vocal about it. I'm, I'm reading all this stuff. It's like all anyone's taking into account is that this idea that they're coming after your rights and and emphasizing the idea of a good person with a gun that can protect people in these terrible situations which can happen as well, but what we have to address it. That's not what we're talking about. We have to address how the fuck do these crazy people get guns? Why? Why are so many people on mental health medication?

Speaker 1:          01:31:20       Well, that's a huge, a huge fund and we always have one thing to have the conversation about it, but there's very little done on it. That's one thing. I'm very struck by this. We have in all our countries, I slipped into a very weird attitude towards this type of medical.

Speaker 2:          01:31:35       Okay. Yes. Very weird. Very just very accepting of something that radically alters the way your mind works

Speaker 1:          01:31:43       and maybe it's maybe it's not an incentive. Drug companies obviously don't have an incentive quite the opposite and to look into it, but it's another example of the set of set of things we should be thinking about at the moment, looking at which we just don't. Why don't we, because it's sort of shut down because we shut it down ourselves. I, uh, I think it's just a such a range of issues. This is the case with and it's always the same thing. It's always that if you address the question difficult as it might be, you are attacking an individual who might suffer from it, who might be upset by US addressing the question. I mean, I have a lot of suspicions about all sorts of things. I'm a very skeptical person. Is it worried about things that I'm told. So I'd like to look into things.

Speaker 1:          01:32:33       I'm amazed at the number of things in, in our societies that we just don't discuss net all the things that we ought to be discussing. Um, issues like mental health issues, uh, issues that have to do with a social presumptions that are going on left, right and center at the moment where you're not meant to discuss things that have popped into me. I was very, very interesting and very important. Um, and I just see it everywhere. Um, this might, by the way, so this is a slightly strange segue to make, but there was a fascinating one in in Britain a couple of days ago, a slightly lighter subject, but there was not that much. But, um, there's a dive in the UK called Tom Daley who married a screenwriter from Hollywood called Dustin Lance black. And it was announced a couple of weeks ago on Valentine's Day that they were having a baby and there was a photograph of them holding a scan.

Speaker 1:          01:33:28       They sent out on their twitter. The two men who are married who have ultrasound scan and all of the papers and the BBC and evidence report is saying Dustin and Tom are having a baby. And I mean, I'm gay and I'm, I don't think I'm homophobic, but I looked at this as how, how like someone else involved. I mean, in a joke, gays, uh, you can't have children. Doesn't mean we can't keep trying, but I just loaded, it has nothing in the articles about this tells me anything I would like to know, like I know that they didn't just have a role around and woke up in the morning and one of them was [inaudible]. I know that. And I know that there has to be a woman involved at some point we know this, but we are meant to just adapt. Okay, great. Cool. And it's almost as if it's set up so that somebody says, wait a isn't, isn't, isn't a woman, isn't a uterus, so that they're no longer is a big word, right?

Speaker 1:          01:34:35       Racist, sexist, xenophobic. Yeah. Everything we've got. Uh, and, and of course somebody did really well. Somebody from the Daily Mail wrote a column saying, come on to dads isn't a new normal sort of thing. And of course then everyone piled in on that. And although he always advertises, withdrew their advertising. But this was just on, this was like literally literally until the day before yesterday. It was possible to say I didn't think two guys can just like, have sex and make a tiled. Literally that was okay until the day before yesterday. And it's not okay today. So what will not be okay tomorrow? And I just think, I think, and I wrote about it, uh, and uh, and uh, maybe a couple other people ended up doing it too. But I think that's really interesting. Like a lot of these answers. I think it's really interesting about this, that you are the things that seem very obvious to us are all the things you're not meant to write about. Almost as if they're like booby traps where you need to go off and, and I just think, oh, why don't more people pile on in because we could have a heck of a time and we might solve.

Speaker 2:          01:35:45       Well, people don't want to pile in on anything revolving involving gender or sexuality. It's just too scary. It's landmine field. They can walk in, especially as you said earlier, people with regular jobs, if you get called out for being a racist or a homophobe or anything along those lines, you're doomed.

Speaker 1:          01:36:04       Sure. It's, um, it. But in that case, anyone who does have a voice as a writer, a speaker, whatever, broadcaster, I think has a disproportionate duty to do so. To do that. I mean, there's no point in just repeating those same new lies, uh, the disproportion of duty to try to break them down. I remember one of my favorite quotes that went from her mencken who says, you know, that history was always progressed by jolly fellows, heaving dead cats into sanctuaries and going roy string down the highways of the world. And, um, uh, I just, I, I, I wish that there were more dead cat lovers because he's such a bad job. You can make a living sometimes and um, and it's, it's, it's one of the only things worth doing if, if we're all going to be told lies and we expect you to go along with them, whether it's about terrorism or, or gay parenting or mental health or anything else, whole set of them. It's a really target rich environment.

Speaker 2:          01:37:11       It is, and I think there's more people doing that now than ever before, but it's more people like you and I who can kind of get away with it. Yeah, I know. What, why do you think you'd get away with it? By the way? Me? Because he can't take me seriously. I'm a cage fighting commentator and a dirty comedian. Right? Nobody's listening to me and take me seriously in that regard. Book sort of. It's A. I just. First of all, I'm a kind person. I think that helps. Like I'm not a mean person, but what I'm saying, these things I'm saying these things from I'm going, what, what the fuck is this? Like, here's one that I thought was really fascinating and this is one of the great example of how strange we get on subjects. Uh, Caitlyn Jenner, when, when Caitlyn Jenner transitioned, that was the primary thing that people were talking about. Oh my God, she's a woman now and it was right after she had been spacing out behind the wheel, slammed into a woman and pushed her into traffic and a head on collision and the woman died. And that was almost just completely forgot. Completely forgot. Not only that, she doesn't believe in gay marriage. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:38:27       Like what? You're, you have the wrong spokesperson. I mean, you could not have a more wrong spokesperson. Yeah. But yet espn and Glamor woman of the year and all these different things and athlete of the year is wearing dresses and fabulous and Glam and let's get your chin shaved down because that's who you really are. We really are. Is not this person there. No. You gotTa, you gotTa Shave your.

Speaker 1:          01:38:53       It's, it's, it's, it's back to that thing about the. Almost as if you're being dead. Yes. You're there to discuss it. Because I said this to Sam Harris, I got him into trouble just on his podcast by saying this and he didn't attack me. Apparently he got a whole load of transphobia accusations because of me saying something. But I said to him, I thought what was happening was that we were being asked not only to agree that Caitlin Bruce Jenner became Caitlyn Jenner. The caitlyn Jenner was a woman, but that, but you have to find out. Yes, you have to say she's beautiful Shag and Jenna, you were just like. And, and I find those, those ones are just, there was one of the other way. It's a bit like the gave her anything. So it's like I dare you, you just, you just tried pretending, pretending that tolman dusting can't have a baby.

Speaker 1:          01:39:40       Um, and, and it was the same with a little while ago, there was a boy in Britain who was iconic, whether he wanted to turn up school and address. He's like nine years old. And there was a route, I can't remember. The school said yes or no, but it was a big thing. And then it became like a weigh in on the behalf of the nine year old Trans Kid. I got lots of questions to ask that. And then it became a, the, the nine year old kid was, was, was uh, became a model for a fashion shoot. And then it's like, find the nine year old boy who says he's a girl. Attractive and say it's beautiful. How much more do you want to push people? Like, no, they were awarding. They like, like, isn't she lovely? Right? What are you doing to us? What are you trying to make us agree to?

Speaker 5:          01:40:37       Right.

Speaker 2:          01:40:37       Well, what's, what's the cause of all this? Have you. I mean, you must've been talking about this, like what? This is this bizarre, illogical conversation that falls into these very convenient, well cut grooves that you're really not allowed to slide ideas out

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       of what's causing this. I think it's a so many things I want is one is that it's possible. This is what happens when the economics goes wrong. I've got a feeling. The economics, I mean is that if people's, if people aren't seeing it increases in their living. I mean, my generation, I'm 38, uh, by just above this generation, but the generations ever so slightly below me, um, is becoming aware that weren't, get on the property ladder at all. Maybe a property ladder, meaning owning a home, owning a home, the things that their parents generation got not easily by any means, but it wasn't, uh, it wasn't easy for boomers, but, uh, that, that somehow they're going to have it harder than their parents' generation. Well, might not enjoy the living standards of the parents' generation. Enjoyed, might be certainly in western Europe coming home. It might be occurring to them.

Speaker 1:          01:41:52       What do you do in those such situations? Um, you've got to have other things to, to get worth from. If for instance, you're not going to own a home until you're 40 and that point, if you're a woman at your career, you need to have children, but you can't afford to take the time off work and you might not be able to start a family and then you're trying to start a family in your forties and it's harder, uh, very hard and a whole set of other things like that that are definitely delayed for new generation. And I think that it's possible. I'm not saying certainly it's possible. It seems to me that that generation might discover new gods. I might want to enforce the new rules just as avidly as the old gods. And there is an element of that girl. I can't understand why.

Speaker 1:          01:42:42       Otherwise, every time I talk about the things we taught her say they would just continuously be this very angry. We actually not. It's interesting. You know, I never thought that. I think probably like, you know, I mean, it's quite hard to shock me or to upset me. Uh, you know, and I can. Oh, that's interesting. Or why do you think that? Uh, so why do I always get this? Like we've got to stop him? Uh, other than that, these are new commandments were breaking and, and why so, and I mean they're all sort of connected, aren't they? These things they're all attempts to, but they're all attempts to something like purity, which disturbs me. What sort of, if we could just get everything in a row, you know, you even hear that thing get in your lane. I hate the people who say that that's all in your lane or do you think you are a, what's my lane?

Speaker 1:          01:43:42       I think I've said it a few times, you know, but I mean, sorry, but the only people that needed to stay in their lane. I'm different. New York Times. Yes. I was reading on the plane over. Okay, now I'm reading your time on the planet and uh, and there's a, there's a question as a, uh, you know, w we call it, what do you go south? Hell, whatever advice column this woman says she was on the, on the train covered days ago and there was a man who came in with his girlfriend. He was being really abusive to her and it just kept happening and he was really. It was kind of nasty ball and violence situation. She doesn't know what to do. Other people in the case, they will move away and of course you can see what's coming. The combination of it is she says she gets off the train.

Speaker 1:          01:44:22       She wonders whether she should have said something, but she says conscious of her white privilege and that these people were people of color, and I'm reading this. I'm thinking, what you you now now if you saw a man of different skin pigmentation from you abusing a woman, have different skin pigmentation from you. The right thing is not to defend the woman. That seems like just a real justification for being a coward. Yes, but, but, but I found the advice was yeah, now you did the right thing. Maybe you should've spoken to an official suddenly, but there was no kind of. So all this stuff, all this weird get in your lane. No, no, no. You're a privileged way of your privilege. I mean, that's a good way to make society have a nervous breakdown. Is Way up your privilege, you know, privilege scorecards. I mean my God, I am, but, but all of these things seem to.

Speaker 1:          01:45:17       It's almost as if people think if we get the, the, the lanes correct, everything will be sorted and here's the problem is first of all the means of doing this. It just hideous. I mean hideous. They accentuate racial difference. They accentuates sexual and gender differences and accentuate everything else and the destination is horrible, is not the nirvana they think that they're creating. So this is a really good moment to, to try to look at some of this and to talk about it and to think about as widely and as freely as we can and yet, and yet the effort is to do the opposite. I think you're onto something with the idea that this radical progressive, very restrictive line of communication ideology that we're experiencing, we're talking about is coming from a lot of people that don't have a religion. Yes, there are atheists or they're at the very least agnostics, modern progressives.

Speaker 1:          01:46:21       Very rarely religious. Yes, and this must be for somebody who's a nonbeliever like myself. This is a painful thing to look at, but again, you have to think about it, but that's. Isn't that an interesting thing as well because you think of yourself as being on a team with these other atheists or agnostics, etc. I don't, but you don't, but I'm saying as an atheist yourself, you have to look at it that way. You've already lumped yourself In with them. Yes. I, I speaking to campus in with us for a while ago and I spoke to a, a guy who's really, really clever, skewed into as a free thinker and he said, he said to the officers, you were talking. He said, you know, he'd have some hideous experience at a local free thinkers society, you know, everyone was like, get in your lane. And he was like, I thought that being among free thinkers, like the rest of it will be good. I was like, no, no, no, no. They, uh, the free thinkers turn out to be just as able to be blindfolded if you, you know, on certain things down

Speaker 2:          01:47:17       when you imagine this, of course self proclaimed free thinkers would be even more inclined to adopt a rigid ideology. There are proclaiming themselves to be a free

Speaker 1:          01:47:27       thinker. And it's possible that this comes from that, you know, the, the, uh, the old joke about sentences, you know, the, the, the sensor knows everythIng that the people who are really into. And uh, I spoke once to man who was on the british board of film classification or you said all day watching really hardcore pornography, deciding what can be legalized. And the last thing, you must have a dark view of humanity.

Speaker 2:          01:47:51       Well, that's what justice wasn't justice scalia's, uh, interpretation of pornography. I don't know how to describe it, but I'll know it when I see it exactly. Like why are you a fucking judge?

Speaker 1:          01:48:02       And it may be, but it may be that these people that a lot of conservatives have this thing, that one becomes rigid about something because you've seen into the abyss because you don't know. You might behave in a certain very terrible way and so you, you, you want to pull back from that chaos. You want to pull other people back as well. Seems to me that a lot of circled free thinker, self designated free thing is may well have these glimpses and may well think, I don't know what's holding this together and therefore might precisely for that reason be disproportionately rigid on almost any new ideology that came along. Getting lane. Yeah. Yeah. I like it.

Speaker 2:          01:48:51       This idea that this is almost like a substitution for religion. It's almost like there's an inherent need that we have because human beings have operated under these patterns for so long.

Speaker 1:          01:49:03       We clearly have this need. It'd be upset. Did pretend we didn't, you know? Yeah. It's,

Speaker 2:          01:49:10       it's interesting because the more you, like, we found ways to market and one of the ways to market and I think that that's important and that mockery, although it seems trivial, what it does do is let people know how ridiculous other people feel those ideas are and then it makes them reexamined themselves because they don't like being mocked the term social justice warriors. Wonderful for that because it just makes you look like such a fucking fool. I'm a social justice warrior.

Speaker 1:          01:49:39       It was a site that I was a colleague of mine, a spectator in london called the rod little road a few years ago. Any any man who says he's a feminist? Clearly just as seeking a shag. Oh, for sure. For sure. It's amazing.

Speaker 3:          01:49:53       One thing to want quality, but to proudly state that you're a feminist is it's almost. I have joked around about it like, I see what you're doing. You don't run fast. You can't pick things up. That was like the fuck somebody said it's about a, the end

Speaker 1:          01:50:08       written. Uh, they said, uh, they described themselves as an anti racist party and as a comedian who said it actually makes, makes you think they might be racist. It'd be like saying your, an ntp to affiliate children's agents.

Speaker 3:          01:50:22       See you think, who is the community that said that doesn't exist. That's hilarious. That's so true. It's so true. And so it's virtue signaling to the highest degree. It's like you're, you're putting up your flag of, of moral superiority standing on your high ground.

Speaker 1:          01:50:40       But it is, it is, it, it obviouslY means a great deal to talk to these people, but yeah, but then the question is just how to, how to invite them not to think like that.

Speaker 3:          01:50:47       I think mockery mockeries one of the best ways because it just lets them know that other people think it's preposterous, so it's not achieving the desired result. The desired result is, oh, look at this amazing person is incredible progressive ways of thinking. Not like, oh, look at this transparent fuck who's just trying to get laid. you know, that's, that's how a lot of us see it, but they don't see that. We see it that way in some of the, I mean, it's a lot of ways. A lot of our behavior is a, it's experimental, you know, I mean, people are experimenting with various different ways of gaining a social preference points.

Speaker 1:          01:51:27       Well, this is, this is why I always say even if even if people aren't believers, there were things that they can learn from religion and from tradition. And I've always thought that the, um, I've always thought there's one central insight of the judeo christian tradition, which I wish that the social justice warriors bore in mind. And that is, that's the garden of eden. And, and, and the, the, the what we call the crooked timber of humanitY. Just just to recognize the central truth, which is in that tradition and in others that we were not born in this situation of research and a, a perfection, uh, or goodness, uh, quite, quite otherwise. We are. We are thIs very, very, a contorted beIng, a which is, which is capable of incredible greatness and beauty and kindness and forgiveness and also capable of they're opposites. And that's, and that it's not, it's not that you are one and other people are the other, but the, all of us, all of us, uh, uh, both, all the time and so there never is a victory and there never is a win other than trying to deal with and restrain your own worst impulses in the life that you have

Speaker 2:          01:52:51       and honestly express all the issues that arrive while you're trying to do,

Speaker 1:          01:52:55       do that. Absolutely. And, and, and trying to tell the truth where you see it and, and giving voice to it and trying to. I mean, you know, this is just, it just seems so clear to me that, that if people, if people could realize this is a central problem of the thing that you and I and others, all faith is the desire to claim that, that somebody who disagrees on issue isn't just have a disagreeing mind but evil and that in any way we have in britain, we are ranked at the moment still by 18 months after a single vote on a single matter of governance. We are still wracked by really unpleasant polItics from brexit. Yeah. And I suspect it's not an, I hate the overlap of the two, but it's probably something like the trump events here, but again and again, you come back to the same thing, which is just instead of thinking one side is entirely right and the other entirely, it didn't say you give up on objective factor anything else, but just consider that your opponent might be approaching us with an honest motive and might have honest reasons for disagreeing with you.

Speaker 1:          01:54:04       And in the absence of that and with media just endlessly feeding us whatever it is we know our own side happens to think I'm in the absence of that. I just see our trenches in both our countries just being dug deeper and deeper until, until there's just no hope of being able to even shout over the top and be heard. And one can get to that stage if, if, as I say, you recognize that it's, it's, it's not a constant fight against nazis. And you know, I mean it, it, it's. By the way, I'd also never to forget that the nazis didn't seem like the nazi's were a lot of people when the nazis were being nazis. Um, uh, but it's just, it's just not as easy as that. No, it's not in a, but it's, it's an easy way to demonize the other side. Yeah, it's an easy way to prop up your side. It's a, it's a cheap trick. It is. But going back to where we started, what if the cheap trick ends up having some terrible consequence, um, of making all of our defenses go down. Um, you know, if, uh, if, uh, if I'm not

Speaker 2:          01:55:19       well, the both of you, I mean, when we started the conversation off with that community guideline strike like, good lord, this is, this really is a very, very strange time.
