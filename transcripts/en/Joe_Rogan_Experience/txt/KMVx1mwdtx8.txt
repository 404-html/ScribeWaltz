Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Boom, and we're live. Hello Charles or chuck? Which one? So Chuck is my, uh, Internet named Charles is like my real person name. Oh, you're one of those, do you got a dual personality thing? Goal at? Somebody took some at some dude in like Michigan took at Charles C. Johnson, so I was like, all right chuck. It is then. Does anybody actually call you chuck? Yeah. Um, like my grandma and like a few people from Boston, but not that many folks. Chuck, what, what part of Boston you from? Um, from a, so it was [inaudible] seven hills stopped like on the red line. I'm like, did that be like the Dorchester south line? So I'm from there. Then we moved to Milton when I uh, went to, went to school and uh, Dorchester's a rough neighborhood. It was more rough back in the day. Now it's become kind of a Vietnamese kind of, you know, there are lots of games that have moved in.

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       It's kind of moved a little upscale. Interesting. The gays are very good at making things upscale. It's a gentrification. You're allowed to say the gay still, but you can't say the blacks if you noticed that. Yeah, I have noticed that. My rule is that if it's one syllable, if it's like fewer syllables, you should be allowed to say it though. You know like, but like you know like African American, it's really like a long word. Like blacks. It's just simple. It's like quick, you can tweet it faster, right? Caucasians too much. It should be white. The whites. Now you could say the whites because a there, you know the preferred, what is it? Oh, how would you say the privileged class, and you're allowed to say the whites, but if you say the blacks, it sounds like derogatory. It is. It depends on the tone too.

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       Like I think juice is one of those words too. Or if you say the wrong tone, that's true. Bad. Yeah. If you say the Jews have one more Nobel prizes than any other people that, and then you're all right. You know European Jews, which is true. They have one more Nobel prizes for science and I think than any other racial or gender or religion. It's not really a race though. Did you choose your very confusing, was it, cause it's you would call it a race but it's not necessarily, it's based on a religion, you know, you like guys, you know, so it's like kind of its own thing and then you just look at like how wealthy they are and how successful they are and it's kind of interesting. It's a grind to get into. Like if you want to become a Jew, my uncle Salvador Digerlando became a Jew, married a Jewish woman and I had to go through the whole grind.

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       But that mother fucker had a work like you got to learn a bunch of Shit, you've got to go to Hebrew school. It's, it's not easy. It's pretty legit. Like so legit. It's not like, you know, I became a Catholic and it was kind of kind of easy. You got to show up for a few things, you know? Yeah. Like you could be a born again Christian tomorrow. You could walk into any church and say, I want to be a Christian. Like come on in son. The Lord touched you or you just have to say what is in the Shahada for Muslims, right? Like is that what you have to do? You just have to say that and you're good. Like that's all it is. That's all it is. Not the Jews. You got to jump through hoops. Gotta work. They gotta they gotta look at you side betting.

Speaker 1:          00:02:50       You, I don't know about this motherfucker. When did they start using the term you this for blacks because that's a great question. That is a, they never say youths stealing and rioting when they're dealing with white people. They will say white teenagers causing violence. You know what? They don't say youths. Will you remember like two years ago there was like this Huntington beach, you know, riot or like stealing bicycles and stuff. I was there like with my wife and I, we were just like chilling on the beach. You know, like we start seeing like all these cops show up and we're like, what the hell's going on? Like is it martial law? Like what's happening? You know, cause you know, like in the movies, you know, like some stuff starts to happen and then like all the cops show up and it's like by essence since like we were just kind of confused or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:03:34       And the whole like riot took a place in like an hour and people like turned over a few Porta potties. And so everyone's been like tweeting out pictures of that as like white people riot too. And I'm like, no, no. Like this is not, this is not comparable. Like I was there for that and I didn't even know what was going on. Well the only way you could compare it as are there pockets of white people that experienced such absolute poverty, like pockets of black people. And until you have that, it's really difficult to, to make that sort of a comparison. Like there's no giant ghettos of white people the way there are giant ghettos. But I, I don't know what that would even look like. I, you know, I'm sure like the depression, like back in the old days, yeah. Trailer Park, Irish and Italians back in the day.

Speaker 1:          00:04:18       But yeah, back in the early 19 hundreds so I'm sure there were places like that. We also used to be a bike, a much more violent, like white people used to be much more violent. I think too, like if you just think about like the index of like bar room fights and all that stuff. It's all been like plummeting. And I don't know if that's because we're becoming pussies are like what that's about. But like if you just think about it like when was the last time you heard of like a legit bar fight? Recently like Canada, they still fucking throw down in Canada. Yeah, they're Canadians kind of like a different thing. There are different kinds of white people. They're more polite too, which is odd, but they will fuck you up in a bar like Jacqueline Hyde, the, the booze flows, it comes out well, it's also, they have a long tradition of hockey fights.

Speaker 1:          00:05:01       So they have like this sport that you could use as like an analogy to society and in that sport occasionally shit goes wrong and they just start duking it out. But you know, like I was talking together mechanics and they like, they like don't have black people there. It's like the strangest thing. What do you mean in Canada? Yeah, but not, I mean they have them, but they're like not on our, it's like scale. Like they don't have like urban ghettos like we, that is true. Yeah. And you know, like, um, there is sort of no Baltimore equivalent in Canada. Well, they didn't have the level of slavery. I'm sure there was some slavery in Canada, but the level of slavery in comparison to the United States, I mean, we, we will conveniently, people always want to go, oh, that was so long ago. Not really. No, no. I mean, 150 years, right. Shit. I mean, Ben Affleck's ancestors on slaves. Right. Isn't it funny that he was trying to cover that up? How would that, I want to know what that conversation was like. Like a skip, skip gates like comes in and he's like, Yo, there's something you should know. Like, I want to know what that was like. Right. How

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       would you break that to somebody? Um, I guess you would call them. Well, I don't understand why anybody would want to cover up the fact that someone in their life, I guess because he's benefited from that. Well, he's called for reparations in the past. He has. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. So I wish, I wonder if he's like, should I pay up now? Like how does that, how does that work? That ain't going to fucking fix shit. It's like, reparations is like giving people the lottery money, like lottery winners. They all go broke. You could just give people reparation money that's not going to make them feel better. The only way reparations are really going to work. Because if you look at, if you look at it, okay, say you got 18, 65 was women's slavery was abolished, right? Yeah. In this country. Yeah. Look at, um, the areas where people had slaves.

Speaker 2:          00:06:45       Look at the ghettos. Look at these entire, almost entirely black communities that are ridiculously impoverished. And then look at this cycle and say, all right, there's gotta be a way this can be fixed. This has gotta be a way, this can be mitigated. There's gotta be a way you can, I mean a lot of people say that that sounds like socialism. That's all well and good, but until someone steps in and does something with these incredibly impoverished areas, you're going to have this repeating cycle over and over again of people who were born in poverty and crime ridden streets that have children that were born in poverty and crime in the streets. And occasionally an athlete breaks through and occasionally a comedian breaks through or a rapper or musician or someone escapes this, this cycle. But most people do not. And that is a symptomatic problem with these areas.

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       I mean it is, you have a, a symptom that needs to be addressed. You have a shoes issue that needs to be addressed. And that's if you wanted to say that there should be reparations for slavery, that should be the reparations, not like individuals getting a check that's not going to fix shit. You've got to go in and figuring out how to make these areas safer, how to make communities safer, how to make like community centers and then give people counseling and, and, and better education. You think that would actually work? Like so like there's this thing called Dick to Shaker heights effect, right? Where they found that like even like wealthy black suburbs like, you know, like in Shaker Heights, Ohio, like still don't really do all that well. Like the Asian kids still do better, you know, academically, you know like, I dunno, I mean I used to be like one of these guys that thinks that like we could just like solve the problems of the ghetto and like move everyone out and everything would work out.

Speaker 2:          00:08:26       But I think there's something to be said that some people like, like living there, you know, like there's kind of like an undercurrent of our society that they like digs the poverty stuff that like digs the gangster style. I think a lot of the people that do it's because it's familiar, it's how they grew up. I mean, I think if you took that same child from birth and you know trans, I mean if you, if you could obviously couldn't do it, but if you could live two completely separate lives, if you could have two of the exact same people and one of them is born to a really happy, uh, educated black couple and they live in a nice suburb of Atlanta where they'd go to great schools and the other one is in Baltimore and you, you get to see the same child develop with different stimuli in different environment. And one of them was like, fuck, I liked the ghetto. And the other one is like, man, I'm glad I don't live in Baltimore. I mean you, you

Speaker 3:          00:09:19       say like, so I was talking to my cousin and my cousin likes an employer in Baltimore. Like I know a number of people, like in Baltimore, number of black people and there's so many people who are just sick of this shit, like so many black, they're like, we never hear from like from them. Like, we never hear like, oh fuck, like riots, you know, like you imagined like were just like chilling here and there, like a riot breaks out. I mean, that's like, that's like a legit thing that you have to worry about when you live in some of these community.

Speaker 2:          00:09:40       It is. Yeah, it is. It absolutely is. But again, I don't think it's the, it's a fucked up thing to say, but I don't think it's the fault of the people that lived there. I think the people that live there, if you look at those kids that rob, that rt reporter, do you see that today? Yeah. Yeah. That was wild. Wild. That was like, that was like something out of like a movie that was like the purge. You know what I loved about it? They got saved by the cops. The Archie reporter got saved by the cops. The cops came in and tackled the guy that stole the purse. Like there you go. You need cops. Okay. So for all these fucking crazy ultra progressive fuck the police people, it's not fuck the police. It's, um, managing, doing the fucking job of the police. It's an impossible job. It's what it is. No, I

Speaker 3:          00:10:18       saw it. So I mean, I was the guy who sued to get Michael Brown's juvenile records. Like we sued unsuccessful, I think we wake went all the way to the Supreme Court in Missouri. Like I like fought this one really hard because like people should know like what these communities are actually like, like Canfield apartments where they were brown was from was like a fucked up hell hole. And like the more we're just, we gotta be honest about these places and like we need people to actually see them. So whenever we get these riots it's like on the one hand, like it's sad and like, you know, I'm obviously worried about my family that's there. But like on the other hand it's like, it's such a great illustration of like reality, you know, like of like, you know, forget all of your progressive social justice nonsense. And like in the final analysis when the shit goes down, you either want to have a gun, you want to know a Korean who's got a gun like here in La, right?

Speaker 3:          00:11:04       Or you want to like, you know, take care of, take care of business and people don't, people don't get that. They, this whole like fuck the police mentality is really causing some serious stuff to go wrong in our society right now because people are starting to have this like mindset that like cops are evil, that they're predatory, that they're dangerous. And it's obvious like why the Obama administration is pushing it because they get these consent decrees in where they can basically rewrite the policing rules and essentially take over the policing departments. So it's obvious like it's a power grab for like the control of these cities. Um, and that's why like, I think we should be very, very cautious about how far we push it. Because I mean, yeah, there are some messed up cops and I think, but you know, you have to walk a day in these people's shoes.

Speaker 3:          00:11:47       Like I did a ride along with the LAPD, which I highly recommend and there's some stuff that they have to deal with just like on a routine that's pretty wild. Like even here in La, you know? Oh, they certainly do it. I think the issue is not that cops bad and that, uh, you know, we need to clean up the police department. The issue is we need to figure out a way to make society safer for everybody involved, including the people that are stuck in those places, like, like Brown's apartment complex and the neighborhood that he lived in. When, you know, growing up in that neighborhood, man, you're gonna be fucked. You're fucked. You're growing up around thugs. Every one of your friends are all criminals. Every, it's just the people imitate their atmosphere. We always have. But you know, like if you take brown as an example, right?

Speaker 3:          00:12:31       We did a bunch of research on him and he hadn't, so he went to the second most violent public school and like all of Missouri and he actually chose to stay there. Like he could've moved out with, I think he was a giant dude though. Yeah. So that's what I'm saying though is that like, you know, to some people like living in these environments can actually be kind of rewarding if you're a big dude and you don't have a lot of skills, you can be big Mike and be an enforcer, you know? Right. But if big Mike was living in, you know, San Francisco and a really nice neighborhood, progressive parents went to good schools from the time he was a baby who did be a different human being, I hope. Thank you. Yeah, I think you're right. But like, even if you look at like, I mean if you just look at the numbers for black on white crime, violence and all that stuff, it's like, it's pretty, it's pretty shocking.

Speaker 3:          00:13:14       Even among relatively like affluent areas, you know, it's, I mean, uh, you know, there's been a lot of discussion, like, is this innate? Is this like just something we have to deal with? Like there's this whole debate about the m a Oh, a gene, which is like this gene that black America black Africans have like much, it's like a proclivity to violence that they have and may owe a gene. Um, I, you know, I recommend people Google it and do their own research. It's like a big debate about whether or not, but basically like what it is is it's, you know, if we, if you think about like, you know, kind of white European, Asian ancestors as we kind of moved out of Africa, like aggression and violence was kind of less necessary cause we were like farmers and stuff. Right. Is that really true though?

Speaker 3:          00:13:57       I mean you look at all the violence and murder and death, it's been done by the military and you think about how many people involved in the military are white and how many people making the decisions are white. I mean ultimately that's white people causing violence. True. But like, I mean, I totally agree with you, right? Like the industrialized kind of like Nazi effication or like of like the industrial size, like military industrial complex is like a serious threat, no doubt about it. But if you like there's a book by this guy, Steven pinker [inaudible] hit a about violence and he's basically like, look, if you just look throughout human history of violence is actually going down because like back in the day, we'd be like in tribal societies and we would go and beat the shit out of this drive and take their stuff. And you know, most of the violence was like we'd spring up on people and then just butcher them and, you know, steal their women or whatever. And that, that was like the way that was like the way politics was hilarious. That was like a big thing. They would go and steal women. Where are the women?

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       Yeah, I'm gonna come steal them. It's Kinda, it's Kinda weird like to think about like that rape culture versus like this, this fake rape culture that they're trying to promote. Yeah. Well, I think that, uh, if you looked at these people, I mean if you're saying that, um, as a whole, that white folks are generally slowly becoming less and less violent, whereas there is a certain percentage of whatever it is of black people that contain this gene. Look at what black people have to deal with as opposed to white people. Like what we were talking about with Canada, Canada has no, no black ghetto, if you're growing up in a ghetto is, I mean, you're fucked from birth. I mean, you really are. There's really not much as far as options to get out. Sure. And the constant inundation of negative influences is his innocent blood out.

Speaker 1:          00:15:39       I mean, we always talk about people like, you know, getting out of the ghetto and thriving, right? Like we always like, that's always like the thing you hear, like when you hear about it like successful black Americans, right? It's like the one tuna that gets through the net. You're right. Whole, we never hear about people being like, you know, I started a great small business in the ghetto, in the ghetto is my corner of the ghetto is now got Starbucks on every corner. You know, that was one of the saddest things about Ferguson was they were robbing black owned businesses. Yeah. Smashing down the windows, burning them down. I mean, this was like people were freaking out. They were like, God damn it. I'm a part of his fucking community. I didn't shoot that kid. I didn't do anything wrong. You're using this as an opportunity to better yourself using this as an opportunity to steal and just take things and claim that it's because there's one guy got shot and you look at like, um, like my in laws family, they're a Asian immigrants.

Speaker 1:          00:16:26       You know, my wife's an immigrant from you and you look at like the kind of neighborhoods they move into to kind of like, you know, run the corner store or run like the quickie mart or whatever. Um, terribly racist set up. But nonetheless, it's like there's some truth in the stereotype. And then you look at like welcome to America. We, you know, the Democratic Party, we love immigrants. And yet if you build your little corner of the American dream, we're not going to protect you when the riots start. And you look at a lot of these businesses that were like burned out in Ferguson and they were like, you know, a nice guy from India coming to this country putting away some money for his family and yet like his property was destroyed and there's a whole bunch of right wing, you know, people on go fund me trying to raise money to basically make these people whole.

Speaker 1:          00:17:05       Um, it's kind of like, it's kind of wild. But I think, I think the technology plus the, the, the history of violence plus like the ghetto politics and the urban policy, I think all of that's like combining right now to create this like massive craziness. I mean, everyone's got iPhones, everyone's like, it's like flash mobs meets Ma, you know, the real mob. Everyone does have this unique ability to organize riots or protests or meet at this place and meet at that place. And I have friends that were involved in the black lives matter thing and they would organize these things and most of the things I disagreed with, like especially the blocking the highway shit, I was like, it's wild, guys are causing death. You're going to cause death. You're going to cause someone's loved ones to die because they can't get to the hospital.

Speaker 1:          00:17:46       That's a fucking fact. Yeah, no, it actually happened I think in a few occasions. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and then you're doing it to just because lives matter. Okay. Look, this is the transportation system. It's where we get medicine through. It's where we get people to the hospital. It's the way we get important things happen on these roads and you're being insanely irresponsible. If you want to, you want to block something, find out where they make the laws and don't let anybody leave block that you know and you want to get arrested somewhere and you want to make a big stink, go to the fucking Capitol building block, that fucking thing. Storming the lawn, you know? But you can't block the God damn highway because that's just too random. I mean you, you, you're from the Boston area too. Yeah. So you remember when there was the Boston thing, like it was like a black lives matter protest in Boston and they like shut down the freeway and like the guy who was like running that was like this hedge fund, you know, he's like the son of some wealthy family and it's like, it's always like these super like, you know, uh, kind of liberal white people who are like trying to like, you know, strike back at the system and you look at all those people who are like you.

Speaker 1:          00:18:46       I mean it sounds like kind of, kind of, kind of silly to say this, but like if you're delayed from work for like 30 minutes or an hour, like that has like a serious impact on your whole day. It has an impact on your, your job. I mean, let's say you're trying to huff it to get to work, but hey man, protests are not supposed to be convenient man. Yeah. But it's like such a Dick thing to do. Well, it's, it's, it's shortsighted. I think the idea that these hedge fund guys realized they were born into this privileged life and they want to somehow know to give back or make an impact. I love that. I think that's great. I just don't think that's the way to do it. And I think they get organized like fuck the system. Fuck Yay everybody was to put a backpack on and run through the street.

Speaker 1:          00:19:25       That is not how you change things. It's just not, it's certainly how you make a little bit of a stink, you know, hey, can you make a ripple? You get some cameras on you. And I would hope that some of this stuff will stop some cops from shooting kids when they don't have to. I mean I think there are times where a police officer is saving someone else's life or trying to protect their own life and they have to use violent force. That's a fact. Yeah. But there was a lot of times where cops shoot people with it shouldn't fucking shoot people and you know it. And I knew of it. We've all seen the videos and there's no denying it. And I think, but they're humans, you know, like what would you do in that situation? I mean, I always made a point is like you, you got to look at the whole thing like what we're talking about with the ghettos and white people and, and violence.

Speaker 1:          00:20:09       You've got to look at the whole thing. And the whole thing is w determinism, there's a bunch of different variables that are taking place that are causing certain Accenture. And if you just say, you know, we gotta block the highway to make black lives matter. What about a black guy that dies because it's fucking wife wants to get him to the hospital because he hasn't got damn heart attack. What about that black life? You don't give a fuck. But you know, a lot of it though is just like, it's like vanity, you know what I mean? It's like posturing. It's like, um, it's like advertising your virtuousness by how much you hate this, right? Once you hate that. And what's kind of weird to me is that like there, we've created a culture right now where the people who can basically like be professional fuck

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       the system people, you know, and it's like, it's wild that these people exist. Like in our society like that that basically they wake up every day and they have enough money, they have enough like donations, whatever to basically just, you know, fuck the system professionally. And it's like, to a certain extent the system probably has accounted for these people. You know, like to a certain extent they buy them off by giving them like, you know, working on Wall Street or the giving them, you know, prestigious internships. But like to a certain extent these people end up becoming tools of the very thing that they're trying to eat. Well like think about it. Like what are they actually like? They're not really accomplishing anything. So like the social justice warrior types there are basically reflecting the establishment view of the colleges. Right. And what are these colleges?

Speaker 3:          00:21:34       They're basically like giant money pits with have large endowments who then invest in, you know, all kinds of things. Like, and I mean in, you know, uh, if you look at like all the investments they're doing, like fossil fuels, you're looking at all the investments they do. And like, I mean, the colleges are so much a part of the system, right? And what they're doing is the social justice warriors are taking their crazy nonsense that they're learning in schools and they're trying to imply it to like the rest of society. But if we did stuff like if right away what we did was we said, look, any of these in college endowments, they have to pay out like 5% of their, of their tuition. Like we do with foundations immediately colleges free for a lot of people, people aren't making massive student debt, but instead the colleges like fight their fight for their privilege.

Speaker 3:          00:22:16       So like, I think what, what I'm, what I'm trying to say is that basically like the bees people are basically the shock troops for the elite without even knowing that they're shocked groups for the elite. Right? Like if you think about like if we talk to like the rape culture stuff, right? It's like a perfect example of this. People are trying to advance a narrative about women and about society and it's a power grab. I mean it's really as simple as that. Like they're trying to end due process rights for young men on campus. They're trying to basically give a, uh, you know, if you don't create a know a title nine compliant college, you know, what we're gonna do is we're going to, we're going to stick our trial lawyers on you and sue you. What does title nine? So basically what the feminists say, all right, this is how they get in to like the whole college racket.

Speaker 3:          00:22:57       We can probably talk about that if you want. But basically what they do is they say, all right, you're not creating a college campus environment because you allow too many rapes on campus. You're not creating college environment that's conducive to men and women. So like what you're doing is essentially your, because you have all these rapists running around what they're, what, you know, it's harder for girls to get good education. So you have to create these like special courts. And if you don't create them to our liking, we're going to sue you and you have a lot of money because if you have, you know, these endowments we just talked about and so it's basically like trial lawyers combining with SJWs to basically to w being social. Social's for us this. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's funny how like all this stuff has been reduced to like three or four characters. You know, it's like all like, yeah, it's the, yeah, it's the Twitter thing that's like infecting your brain, right? Also military, military

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       IED is, they love doing that stuff. You know, he talked to guys that had been in the military, they love using those. Not An acronym. Right? An acronym is like NASA, right? If you say NASA, like I don't know if it's an acronym, the abbreviation, whatever it is, whichever else I should know what that is. Um, but it's okay, so, so what you're saying is that these people, it almost becomes like a Gig. Yeah. They like, they like never leave. They never mentally live. They never mentally leave college. Well that's a real problem with academics in general because a lot of people who are academics, they went to college, they went to graduate school, they got their doctorate, they got their phd, whatever they got, and then they started teaching and they never entered the real world. And they live in this world of extreme liberal values, extreme liberal biases.

Speaker 2:          00:24:33       And who pays for that? Like the tuition of the kids, right? Yeah. And then the endowments that he's like massively rich schools, which are all invested in like horribly anti social justice warrior causes. But what is it that about colleges? This is where it gets fascinating with me. What is it about colleges that almost invariably lean left? Like there's questions you call. I mean it wasn't always this way, right? I mean if you look back historically, like in the 20s and stuff, they were kind of right wing places, Kinda hate left and right. I really do. I kind of hate saying it. I really mad at myself that I just said it because I am just as right as I am. I mean, I am pro gay rights, pro gay marriage, Pro Chan's transgender rights, transgender marriage, pro abortion. I'm pro choice. I'm pro, I'm, I'm so left in so many ways.

Speaker 2:          00:25:22       Um, I'm against the drug war. I'm against privatized prisons. I'm against, I'm pro legalization of drugs, um, against police violence. Sure. But I'm also in the NRA, you know, also, I think the military is important. I think if you go to parts of the world and see how fucked up it is and you don't think you need to have a military, well, you're being a child because we don't live in utopia yet. We're not, we're not in a, in a time in the world where it's safe. We're not, we haven't reached some age of enlightenment. We're on some strange gradual progression pace to one day be free of all the ape violence that lives in our genetics, but in tool. I hope you're right. I don't know. I don't see it happening anytime soon. I mean if you look at what's happening in Baltimore, it seems like, it seems like a lot of the times are kind of primal instincts and our kind of violent stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:26:09       It seems like it's lurking just beneath that thin veneer of civilization. That's Baltimore. And here's the other problem. We're talking about a country of 350 million people yet here we are in woodland hills. Go outside. What are you going to see your birds Chirp? Beautiful. It's sunny out. People are Nice. Go to Starbucks down the street. They'll say, hi, can I help me? Everybody's friendly. You know, this isn't barbarian culture or maybe talk to you about ages, race matters or something. Larry is when they tried to do that, is that the quickest accompany has ever abandoned an idea start. Let's explain it to people, but a lot of people again who have lives unlike

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       us, they might've missed this particular thought. It was, I thought, I thought it was the onion and then I looked into like the corporate leadership of it and they're like all white dudes. They're like all white dudes and white chicks. Hey, I got an idea. This is the way that we can make things different. Let's encourage our Brrristas to talk about race. Hey, you want to a cop? And she knew, um, how do you feel about black be the bell? I wonder what that I would say

Speaker 3:          00:27:11       I wanted to go in. So like what my buddy and I went into the Compton, uh, you know, Starbucks like right when they were doing this and I was wearing like a suit and like a, you know, expensive tie, like all that stuff would come in there and like we're the only white dudes in there. Like where are the, you know, where the dot and the domino, you know what I mean? And we're like walking up and I was so, cause they had the race matters things out and I was like reading it, I was like leaning like behind me, it's like a nation of Islam, like you know, coffee meetup. Because apparently they have those like, yeah, seriously, I'm not, I'm not making this up. Bean pies off. And there's like a picture of me like yeah, I put it up on my Twitter of me like reading the, the, you know, race matters thing while they're, you know, behind me, you know, discussing all, that's Hillary you have done on Twitter.

Speaker 3:          00:27:53       I have on Twitter. Yeah, find out, find that Twitter and let's put it, I'll retweet it. That's fucking hilarious. But so explain the campaign because a lot of people would have no idea what's it. Basically there's this idea that Starbucks had, which was that like the future of the country, their views that like we're going to be a much more racial society, which is probably true. Like you know, diversity and all that. People moving in immigration so forth. And so their view is that like we need to get ahead of it and we need to talk about race because like that's like a big issue. And their attitude was like if we get people together talking about stuff, stuffing coffee shops, it will be like, you know, it's like the old salon stuff like the 1850s or something. People are going to be debating issues and politics and all this and it just totally backfired because people were not having it. They were just making fun of it. They were making fun of the guy who was the head of it. Unbelievably stupid and poorly planned out to the idea that you're just going to put that on w one thing. Writing it on cups or something like that. We're going to write, yeah, they're going to read it on cups that are going to basically

Speaker 1:          00:28:49       Hashtag race together. Is this the guy? This is a guy, I swear to God. I thought this was an onion because you know their stuff. I mean it's so preposterous. Race together. What the fuck does that even mean? That's a terrible Hashtag [inaudible] it sounds like something for the marathon race together. You know like if maybe if you were running a marathon and everybody donated and the charities went towards

Speaker 3:          00:29:13       the human race. It's like if you, if you read it, the non, the non PC, it's a race to get her

Speaker 1:          00:29:19       was a friend of mine was clearly he was like, is this, is this a subtle rape culture thing? Oh No. What a backfire. Well that's why they capitalize the t and they are sir. No, but you can't, you can't not see it. Once you see that, oh you can't see a picture of the chick. So true. That's so funny. She's got her hands up like dope rape

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       me. I have fins. I don't even have hands. Oh fuck. That's hilarious. But Starbucks I think stopped being cool when they changed the check. Like remember where like way back in the day she had like you could like see her boobs and every time it's right. Those cowards and they changed it. So she's like Nazism androgynous. What's wrong with boobs railing? Come on, relax. Everybody relaxed. It's kind of nuts. Did the race together. That'll be ditching race to get her, we should just say it was just called that. So this race to get her idea was they would put a Hashtag on the cup and what would spark up a conversation that would lead the fucking line. The lines are long enough for Starbucks. Those slow poke ass motherfuckers need to drink their own coffee cause they're always real slow. Well imagine if you are like and metric if you're like actually a Barista, right?

Speaker 3:          00:30:27       So you're like there, you're probably a Barista. Like nobody likes sets out in like, yeah, I'm going to be a Starbucks Barista. Like this is not like something you set out like wanting to do with your life. I mean I'm sure it's a perfectly good job, but like nobodies, nobody dreams about this when they're a little kid and so you're working there, you know, you're having to deal with all these like, you know, bitchy, caffeinated people. Right? And like you're supposed to just like, Yo take some time out to go and discuss race with some custom, something like stranger. I mean it's Kinda like, it's kind of like a very anti employee mindset, right? Like, and their timing them, they time them on their drink orders. So it's like kind of a really, they really like how cells they said like Tippett. Um, no. What they'll do is they'll time people on like how long did it take you to do this coffee?

Speaker 3:          00:31:08       Like when they're doing the training, the training stuff, and they want you to basically, you know, do it faster. But apparently your experiences that hasn't sort of worked out well did not that bad. I'm fucking around joking around, but you know, I have been to Starbucks with, they're slow as shit and you're like, there's no double Cappuccino and that guy's diet. Kick it up a little sign. I got to get out of it. Wish you could. I wish you could pay to get faster in line like you can at Tsa. You know, like I know that's like a terribly privileged thing to say anything. But sometimes you're like, Yo, trying to get to work or whatever or trying to get to somewhere and you're like, fuck it. I need to like, I need my coffee and I just get outta here. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:31:43       And there should be some way you can be like, nope. Like I know what you're, I don't know what you have to pay a year to get like the expedited service or something. But yeah, I don't know either. I've gotten that accident only before, but I never, I never, I always say I'm going to sign up for it but I never signed up for it. Are He tried to sign up for it and they denied him. Really? Yeah. He's an asshole to TSA so he's an asshole to him. He got screened once. This guy, he farted in front of this guy and go, go ahead. You got to smell my fart now he's like farted really loud cause his, his idea is that this is not protecting anybody. This is a absolutely a violation of our rights and if you don't yeah and protest it, it'll escalate. My Buddy Neil who's a, he's a Tsh and he couldn't get a job anywhere else and he hates it. Like it's like the most solace job ever. And he was saying like, God bless you to people like right before they're getting on their flights and the TSA people are like, no, you can't say that anymore. To people and he's like, well, you made me swear an oath to like,

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       you know, under God to like, you know, like why can't I just, he's not even like a Super Christian Guy. He's just like, yeah, God bless you. Like have a nice day. It's kind of his way of doing it, just to try and meet and just trying to be nice and they're like the nation of Islam. People in the back, it's funny. Or The Nation of Islam, they're back. The like the dude behind the chick is there and then there's some other folks in front of me too. That's so funny. Yeah, so my, and it was all black people working behind the counter and everything. Yeah. Yeah. Did you ask anybody? Did you interview anybody? How they feel about it was like, well, what's going on with this? And they're like, we don't know. Like they just put these things here. They're just trying to get paid. Why? Why the fuck did they have to deal with this stupid shit?

Speaker 1:          00:33:19       Could you imagine if like you, you're supposed to be some social justice engineer while administering cappuccinos? This is, it's so goofy. It's such a weird thing to ask your employees to do. Bull idea. Like nobody's doing this at home depot. You know what I mean? Like what kind of education in the subtle nuances of race relations are you giving these people before you have them communicate publicly on behalf of your company? Waddling while an employee like I couldn't think of a more poorly thought out idea executed by a giant corporation. Totally agree with you. And then you the fact that it was like designed to all by white people. Like it's like the weirdest part. Zach. I have a black girlfriend, the older dude that was in the race to get her, I know it's a good question. He might have a hot black girlfriend and she's trying to like the bill Maher thing where he thinks he can like criticize black people cause he's dated them kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          00:34:09       Is that what he does? Yeah, that's what he does. Yeah. It feels like he can criticize and he said this, he said like, I've had black hair on my pillow. I like, it's, Oh God. He's like, you said stuff like that. Oh that's so gross. It's creepy. That black hair on my pillow. Oh you girls. It's such a weird thing to do. It's fucking statement. I've had black hair on my pillow. I think he set it on something like marriage counseling thing too. You know how they have like guest judges or whatever. I remember watching that. I was like, well yeah that is crazy. I just think that if you just, if you're capable of saying something like that, I think he's probably just trying to be like, you know, cause he's a joke writer and he's a like a one word, one line impact sort of a guy.

Speaker 1:          00:35:00       That's a kind of thing. I've had black hair on my pillow and you could say things like that's like something that you can see on his show. Like that would be a line to like it's concise. It's quick and has a period at the end of it and it boom and as an impact. Sure, sure. Yeah. I mean something you could see on his show but it didn't quite work. You can't fault them too much for it because of the way he communicates for a living. But as a person, like if you were hanging out with them. Yeah. In fairness, like I got some shit on Twitter cause like, uh, so I, I kept getting all the stuff like your anti-immigrant and your other stuff because I was like tweeting out stuff like, hey, we should be kind of careful about this amnesty stuff. And uh, I was like, yeah, I hate immigrants so much. I'm married

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       one. And then all of these people were like, all these people are like, you're using your Asian wife, you know, to like protect you or whatever. And then I just Hashtag [inaudible] at my Asian wife and I was like, my Asian white. Yeah. Like I was just like making fun of it. And then people thought I like the social justice warriors thought I was serious. So like all of like the Asian social justice warriors started being like, you know, my wife is like a cultural, like appropriation, you know, whatever nonsense they were spewing. I remember just sitting, sitting back like yeah, that's why as my wife and I were like having like, I think we were having like omelets or something in the morning like just sitting on, you know like in, when you, you know, when you wake up on a Sunday and you're still in your pajamas or whatever, it's like holy shit honey. I think I accidentally started a movement.

Speaker 3:          00:36:18       That is a very funny line though. What he said, I hate immigrants so much. I'm married one. That's very funny. I mean it's kind of true. The amnesty thing would be the people that have been in this country for a certain amount of time be allowed to be United States citizens. I mean here's basically the Gig, right? So like people like my wife came to this country from Indonesia and can't really swim from there. It's kind of a long way. And like they waited in line, they like followed all the rules and all this stuff. And then we've got all these people who come into this country illegally from like Mexico south of the border. Cause just cause it's easier to get here and there are a lot of folks who want to make them citizens. The Democrats want to do it because they get, you know, lots of voters, the Republicans want to do it because they get cheap labor, you know, and basically drive down wages are, some Republicans want to do it and I'm just like, you know, it's probably not a good idea to like, you know, give away citizenship like this because we have a lot of people who desperately want to get in here and it's kind of like, it's kind of racist in a way.

Speaker 3:          00:37:11       It's kind of like pro Mexican in a way. If you think about it, just like logically because yeah, that people from Africa, from Europe, whatever who wanted a much harder time and it's just like, it's a much kind of unfair process. You know? I have a very, I wouldn't say unrealistic or Utopian view of this whole thing. I feel like for, first of all, I'm not a big fan of nationalism. I'm not a big fan of borders, but I'm also not a big fan of fucking it up where people have figured out how to get it right and not necessarily the United States has got it right. But I think the real solution is not to like make it easier for people to immigrant. The real solution is to make it easier for Mexicans to live in Mexico. Oh totally agree. Like Mexico. So like it goes amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:37:56       Go there on vacation. It's fucking beautiful. Like it should be like, but there are all these anti white people laws there. They're all these antique gringo laws. Like you can't own beach front property. If you're a white guy there you can't, you can't, you have to or have some crazy beach front. Probably has some like Alibaba Dude, you know who like, no seriously though like you know they have like some Mexican guy who is like the front man for him that runs his thing. But like there are all these antique gringo rules down there and it's kind of like my attitude is like everything we allow Mexicans to do in the states we should be allowed to do in their country. Right. I should be able to get a driver's license in Mexico. You know, you should be able to do all this stuff. And why not?

Speaker 3:          00:38:30       Like I think the real tragedy about the Mexico, first of all, like the drug war, like a policy. We've got to get rid of it cause it's like clearly fucking up Mexico. Um, but we got to just like make Mexico like a good place to live because maybe that way they won't all move here. You know, like if you, if you live down there like, and you're like in cartel land and you go to the u s and you get paid like 15, you know, 15 times more money than you would otherwise. I mean, why? The real question I have is like, given how shitty things are in Mexico, why are so many of them still there? You know, like you have like a great country. Well, there's a fucking wall, first of all. Well sort of, but like people are breaking in all the time, but it's not easy, especially if you have a baby with, sure, sure.

Speaker 3:          00:39:11       Yeah. I have a friend who came over here illegally and she came over here with her baby man. She had a fucking two year old baby and she made it to the United States. How'd she do it? They got an a van or some crazy shit, you know? I mean it was all decades ago, but it's, yeah. Yeah, like back in the day, I think it was a lot easier and it's also terrifying shit, man. If you really stop and think about the idea of going in a van illegally across the border that's got a fence and you have a baby with you and you're just hoping for a better life. But you know, I've been, so, my uncle lives in Guatemala of all places, believe it or not. Like I live in Guatemala, but yeah, as he just banging young Guatemalan chicks, I don't really know. We don't talk about tall man.

Speaker 3:          00:39:50       That would want to know. I know he likes to drink down there cause that's what I'm talking about. Go down there with a fucking fat bottle of Tequila and ask him some questions. I mean you can get beer, they're like 16 cents. Like, I mean it's just, it's out of control. Um, but I've been to the Guatemala, Mexico border and it's like, you know, there's like machine gun turrets and like, so like, you know, they're always criticizing our border buildup and yet if you go to their border with their southern neighbor because they don't want the Guatemalans breaking into their country. That's hilarious. So it's like, you know, they're all criticizing the u s for being racist and everything and yet there, you know, well that's one of the things about if you talk to Latinos, like tail always joke around about the, the racism inside Latino culture.

Speaker 3:          00:40:31       White dudes like don't have any idea about this. Mexican's are, have always had a problem with Puerto Ricans and it's the way that's been established as in boxing and the boxing world. The Mexicans voice had Puerto Ricans are lazy and like this Mexican fighters versus Puerto Rican fighters had been a longterm rivalry. And then there's the Cubans and the Cubans have a problem with the Puerto Ricans and then there's the Guatemalans Hondurans who get no respect and it goes like lower and lower. The further south you go, the more they fuck with him. No, totally right. I mean, and you look at like here with the Salvadorans and the uh, the Salvadorian gangs versus the Mexican ones. And it's like, you know, to, uh, to the social justice warriors are all Hispanic or Latino, Latino. But then you actually like, these are like legit countries that have like legit histories and you know, the real problem and things, even the term social justice warrior is that they're aggressive. Like the, the thing about social justice, so it's like, what do you, what do you, what do you really want? What you want? Peace it. Guess where it, guess what the worst way to get pieces being an asshole. Oh, totally. Being

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       an asshole will almost kind of antisocial and yes, there's a sentence in a lot of ways cause they're like, like they're about doxing people and aggressively pursuing actions against them and trying to get people fired because they don't share their ideology. The weirdest road testing. Totally agree. Like the weirdest thing to me. And I think like people have started to becoming more like, I've certainly become more aggressive just dealing with their shit, you know what I mean? Like less aggressive. Believe it or not about them. Like I, I don't, I don't want to fight with that kind of shit at all because I think it's because it creates a dust cloud of confusion because it's counterproductive. Totally counterproductive. And I share their beliefs on a lot of things. I just don't, I don't share their methodology. I don't share the, the aggressive tactics and I just think that what they're doing is like insanely short sided.

Speaker 1:          00:42:22       They think that their Malcolm x or something, they think that they're like trying to fight the system by screaming, yelling, fuck capitalism. And it's kind of like the people who are born like after the 60s, like they were born after the party and I'm like, and then you could tell they're kind of pissed about it. My friend, my friend Andy Sarabian and I were talking about this and uh, uh, we were talking a lot about like how basically they target you. Like all right so there are two gay guys who like had Ted Cruz over just like chat with him, right? Cause he's like running for president, you know, whatever. And these guys were targeted by all of these like gay social justice warrior types being like, just for talk, just for talking to him like you're mainstreaming, his auntie gave you and like how are we supposed to persuade people of our views if we can't even like talk to them, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:43:06       Like how is that supposed to work? I'm on a bunch of block lists. I'm on block lists, social justice and what I've done, but they're all going to figure out what I did. They're all watching your stuff though. This is the weirdest thing like they block you. And then they all like freak out if you say something like incendiary, but it's like Cindy Arie stuff primarily supportive of almost all the things that they're supportive of, which I think is funny, but I'm mock male feminists the same way. A mock like males, like social justice warriors because I didn't know what your doing. Okay. Like if it's a play for pussy. Exactly. It's a power grab for Social Brownie points. That's what it is. That's primary. I went to this one guy's Twitter page and it sets the quote was something like aggressively feminists or fiercely feminist to like, God damn it son, you need to lift weights.

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       You need to fucking eat some meat. You need to do some squats. You need to be, you need to go run a marathon. You need to do something difficult. It's depressing how Beta, so many of them are going to man up and you don't, you don't, by the way, you don't have to be Alpha and you want to be Beta. There's nothing wrong with that or that's trends that are Beta. Brian Redman is pretty God Damn Beta. You know, he's one of my best friends. Sure. I have a lot of friends that are like feminine or were like less aggressive. There's nothing. We'll just go do shit, just go do shit with that. What I'm, what I'm saying is like this attitude and this aggression that they have towards things masculine,

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       they're sexist. Well like for me that the line was crossed, like all right, so I knew the rolling stone thing was a hoax. Like I was like the first part. Explain to people who might not be aware of what this was one of the first people that did this. I was calling bullshit. Like it's one of the reasons why I wanted you on the show. And then one of the things that I did was I called up some people at the fraternity and just seemed like an obvious thing to do and I was like, yeah, it was there. A party. All right, so there's a story that runs in Rolling Stone magazine and what happens is that it's basically this, this story, it's written by this woman Sabrina Reuben Eardley and the story is about a gang rape. Like a brutal gang rape that occurs at, um, at Uva, university of Virginia.

Speaker 3:          00:45:09       And basically the story has an anecdote in there about this girl Jackie, who is like apparently raped by like if he was either like five guys or seven guys. And this anecdote was like such a big deal among like the rape activist types that it was actually used by this chick, Emily Renda who's he? UVA former UVA student. And it was like used before it was testified before Congress. So it was like, you know, under oath, like brought into the congressional record and I was just, you know, the, the, the gang rape was so ridiculous to me because it was apparently like over hours and I was like, what college dude has like the stamina to go for hours. So that was like the first, no, I mean like legit that like that was like the first tip off to me. And then the other thing too was it was like so graphics, so violent and it was like apparently at a party.

Speaker 3:          00:45:50       So I was like, all right, there's a lot of stuff here that you can just kind of like tease apart. And then what happened was I figured out the girl's name, like I went through and researched like, you know, talk to some people at Uva. Um, got like a list of all the kind of campus feminist and kind of just caught cross referenced it. It's been a long time kind of finding it. And anyway, it's a founder name, you know, his name's Jackie Coakley. Um, and I was like, I published the name of her and I knew that all these people would freak out on Twitter about it and like freak out in the media but something like 150 to 200 newspapers so that I outdid a rape victim. And like my own mother called me up, like complaining about it. And I was like, mom, like, trust me, like this is not what it appears to be.

Speaker 3:          00:46:29       Um, and the, by the way, this newspapers still haven't like done retractions or anything and these are like us news and world report. I mean all these things, they, and they all got me thrown off Twitter for like outing this rape victim and she wasn't a rectum, you know, it was like the weirdest like posts. You didn't totally know though. No, I did because I called up enough people and I knew enough, like enough of the details that the whole story was like just falling apart. Like there was no party that night. There was, I mean, she had a history of making up other stuff in the past. Like I talked to somebody, she's like, you know, who was like kind of close with her. I looked into like the three people who are quoted in the article who are kind of like anonymously quoted. And then I started looking into more and more on Sabrina Reuben Eardley discovering that she'd gotten in trouble for like faking stuff in the past.

Speaker 3:          00:47:10       And I was like, all right, this is not, this is not legit. Like this is fake when I'm kind of stuff that she faked a, she, I mean, I put up some videos on my side. It got news. Um, but basically she, uh, her very first story she ever did for rolling stone was w was a, an interview of some, a profile of a country singer where she got a lot of facts, just basically wrong. And then she started fabricating and she's actually talked about it on video about how she's gotten these things wrong. And so she, like, she's wow. She fabricated and shit and she still got published and rolling stone her after this was been correct. And this was what, when she was a college. And so her entire career basically starts is winning the college journalism award from rolling stone a while she was, you know, at u Penn working with, um, with a glass, you know, Stephen Glass, the guy who was famous fabricator, uh, the new republic.

Speaker 3:          00:47:55       And she basically, her college, her career, her entire life is as at rolling stone. And she was talking about things like how she likes to shop around for victims. I mean, these are like verbatim quotes, how she has a good bs detector. I mean, go and watch the videos. You mean not put them all online on Youtube and they're, they're kind of wild. It's such a fucking explosive subject. It's so dangerous because real gang rapes, real rapes, excuse me, are horrific. They're terrifying. It's disgusting. I totally agree. Humanization that can be eradicated from societal fact. Many of the women who helped me on this stuff like are victims of sexual assault because they're so disgusted with this bullshit. I mean, imagine like actually being a rape victim, right? And then like having to deal with all these bullshit posers pretending to be rape victims and imagine how infuriating that is.

Speaker 3:          00:48:44       Theory and just hearing about this [inaudible] rolling stone failed every single checkpoint of journalism. They did no background check on this whatsoever. They did no vetting of the source. They did. And what happened was I did violates journalists. You see the movie almost famous and how they had like the famous rolling stone fact checkers. I kept wondering like, when are they going to show up? You know, like, when are they gonna like, right. Um, but it makes you wonder about like the whole publication, other shit. Like, I mean, I know Michael Hastings was a great reporter and everything, but people call bullshit on some of his stuff too. And obviously we can't check now because he's dead. Right. But like you makes you wonder about all the other reports that they do there because if they're, if they're so falling down on this one story, um, and apparently like, you know, she's gotten other stuff wrong and other, you know, other stories as well, not just the one I mentioned, but like I wonder what their standards are so lax for her, what the standards are like for the other writers too.

Speaker 3:          00:49:41       Well, it's always a problem when, because of a salacious story, because of anything that's big and juicy, you can become a star. Yeah. Glenn Greenwald is a star and he's a star for a legit reason. I mean, what he did was a legit story. Totally agree. Totally agree. He's a star now. And so there's a lot of people that may be less scrupulous that are looking at that and they're saying, if I can get some of that juice and if I can find a juicy story that I can cling to, I can also become a star. You know, what's weird to me? So like I like taboos like for me, like the whole point of being a journalism or you know, being in journalism is to be basically tell stories that no one else will tell. Cause first of all it gives you a monopoly, right?

Speaker 3:          00:50:20       If no one's talking about topic than you like own that topic. Right? And then second of all, like there are a lot of taboos and our society like race, rape, uh, you know, military, industrial complex, you know, drugs. I mean you could basically, you know, figuring them a genetic differences in intelligence. I mean, that's a big one that we're not supposed to talk about. Um, and for me, like what's weird about this is that journalism increasingly as used to like justify the state justify power, justify, like, you know, basically to push agendas that then become law. And for me that's like kind of like not the point. Like the point is to give the, you know, give the finger to the man. The point is to basically be like against the system. So like, you know, I'm identified as being on the right and I have some right wing views, I have some left wing views, but no one seems to like asking me about those.

Speaker 3:          00:51:02       Um, but yeah, I'll do the story's going after like corrupt Republicans. Like I did a story, you know, voter fraud within a Republican primary and Mississippi there was like ugly. But the thing is is that people want, what they want is they want you to reflect their tribal views and their political views and they don't really want the truth. So like they will fucking hate you even, especially when you're right. So like for years I was talking about this guy, Menendez, US senator who's going down for corruption for years, I was talking about him and I had all the other journalists make fun of me. Like you're just a blogger. You don't know what you're talking about. Even though like I won awards at these guys competed for back in the day, I just didn't want to be in corporate journalism and even more cause I thought it was too restrictive and these guys are assholes.

Speaker 3:          00:51:45       Like you have so much of the culture right now. They just go after anyone that's new and different and it's creating a narrower and narrower and narrower space for people to let their freak flag fly. And I think this is really, really dangerous for our society. And we used to be a society that was like, Yo, this guy, you know, he's, you know, he's a crazy black supremacists, but you know, he makes really good bagels. And I kind of like go and hanging out with them, you know, like we used to be a society that was okay with a little freakiness among people and now it's like you all have to think a certain way. You have to behave in a certain way. And it's like, what could be like, what could be more like anti liberal? Like what could be more like wrong than that.

Speaker 3:          00:52:24       That's a very good way of putting it. Yeah. I think that that, that tribalism things a real issue. You know, that you're with us or against us. How about I'm just a fucking person. I don't want to join your team. I don't want to be on anybody's team. How about can we just be on team human race? Yeah. Can't we all have our own unique viewpoints because we have a unique lives. We, we, we grew up in different environments. We have different points of view, different genetics, different life experiences. The thing that makes me the most excited is when I meet somebody who like thinks something totally outlandish that I don't know. And then I started reading it. I'm like, Holy Shit, this guy's right. Like that's cool. Like it's exciting to change your mind. Like when you don't know something. It's exciting. And I always look for the people who are like courageous enough to be like the Galileo is of our day.

Speaker 3:          00:53:06       Like, no, you're wrong about this. And who are like, you know, sticking it out. I think people have a real issue with admitting that they don't know something and a real issue admitting that they were incorrect. And their assumptions and some people don't ever totally right. They don't ever admit it. They don't ever say, I think I fucked up there. They don't, they don't do that. They just because feel like somehow or another that makes them less, they make like someone's like, ah, you were raw. I think it actually a backtrack what your Dick Tuck over there? Chuck get tucked on that subject. No, and I've seen this like when I say stuff on Twitter like, oh I guess I was wrong on that. Like I guess I was mistaken or whatever. I think it gives you credibility but all these people are like freak out and like you were wrong about this.

Speaker 3:          00:53:45       Like fuck you. Like did it. It was like, dude, like you're on Twitter right now. Like you know at your mom's house. Like you know you're a Twitter right now. Like at work when you show you're working and you're like bitching at me. It's like, what do you, what have you done today? Like what are, what's the word? Ultimately though that that's a good thing that this Twitter thing, I, I've, I'm a, I might be like too optimistic, but I've been accused of that. But I think that this, the ability to complain about everything, the ability to interact with people instantaneously is ultimately a good thing because, awesome. Totally agree. Anybody that's darling like you or not you, but like anybody today, like some kid today can just fucking fire up a blog, some 17 year old girl and just say, I am going to be a fucking journalism journalists major and I'm going to be, I'm going to be a journalist, I'm going to be, I'm going to make my own website that's dedicated to news that people don't want to talk about and I'm gonna try to uncover things and you could do that.

Speaker 3:          00:54:41       Yeah, it's fucking awesome. It's like the coolest thing ever. And I mean like, like I was at the Wall Street Journal editorial page I like was in the News Corp You Fox News, evil empire thing. I worked for all these different publications because my face got it. She was like, I knew shit. Like I started on my career and I was like, nobody knows anything about journalism and the right for as many publications I can, I'm going to go out there and just like how all sorts of crazy wild experiences. And then it became clear to me that like, Holy Shit, like I could run my own website, I could hire people, I could like pay people for information. I could basically like do what I want to do and I could have more impact than if I did like the corporate, the corporate route where I basically have to pay your dues and get coffee and you know, basically be like a cog in the machine.

Speaker 3:          00:55:19       And yeah, this is like revolutionary the fact that like when 140 characters, you know, you can basically, I mean I posted documents that showed that people are lying, you know, in real time while they're talking on Fox News, I posted stuff like, I exposed this chick Elizabeth though baggy who was like the face of going to war in Syria. She like wrote a Wall Street Journal op Ed Column, uh, saying that, you know, there are all these moderates there, we should arm them in Syria. I proved that she was being paid by the Syrian rebels and she faked her phd and like became like a whole scandal. It led to all this stuff and I did that like with Twitter and like fucking around on the Internet and like that is so cool and so revolutionary. The scary thing to me though, right, it's like the combination of like using Twitter and using like the mob, the flash mob stuff like in Baltimore. That to me is like, the real question is like, is the crowd like, you know, as the crowd going to do good things like are we gonna use crowds to like, you know, solve major social problems? Are we going to use them like for as terrorist operations that basically spill out into the real world. And I think it's probably both. There's definitely both. But I think that ultimately information and

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       the access to information is what kind of sets everything free because you, you, you get a, an accurate, clear understanding of what's going on. There's going to be some deception is going to be some, some confusion initially, but I think we're, we're in this trend as a, as a society, as a race, the human race, we're in this trend of expressing ourselves in a much easier way and a much more instantaneous way than anybody's ever had the ability to do ever by far. It's one thing we can pretty much say for a fact as long as we've known about people and the things that people have written down, no one's been able to communicate the weather able to today. And if you look at the slow progression of culture from the dark ages to today, well what is accentuated that progression? What has it been about? It's been about information. It's been about education and ambition, freeing, freeing information, expressing yourself and, and people debating these ideas of expression with now with facts also, like someone could say, you know, you can say something on a podcast, someone say, well, you know what actually that's not true. Here's a link and you go to that link and they go, Whoa, oh shit, I didn't know that that's happened on this podcast a hundred times.

Speaker 4:          00:57:36       No Dude, I love that. Like to me, like to me the most exciting thing is when I got a reader who comes forward and like has information that nobody else has had, right? Who's like a stockbroker. Like I have a lot of like stay at home moms who work with me on stuff because like, you know, their kids are sleeping and they're like fuck it. Like let's Kezar evolution on Twitter. You know, like that is so exciting to me. And like when I learned stuff that like totally up ends how I thought about x or y, it's like, it's cool. You know, like the way, the way I thought about this, there's this essay like I highly recommend called a, what you can't say it's by this Guy Paul Graham. And he talks about like, you know how like if we think about like fashion, right?

Speaker 4:          00:58:12       Fashion comes in and out, we have moral fashions to, right? And what he says is like anytime something says somebody says that's racist, that sex is something ist, right? Capitalist, whatever. They're just reflecting the taboo of their time, you know, that's McCarthy or whatever. And he's like, the most powerful argument against, you know, against something is that it's false. It's bullshit. And if you can figure out, like you can basically check yourself, like I believe x about something, you can check yourself and you'd be like, is this true or not? And if it's not true, then like you gotta have some soul searching. You got to be honest enough to be like, Hey, I might be wrong about this. Or maybe there's just not enough information. Maybe I'm just going to have to like, you know, keep studying on this. You know what I mean? And I think a lot of people just want to, they want to join their gang on Twitter or in like real, the real world, like in Baltimore and they want to go in like, you know, basically be led by somebody. And to me that's like such an elite liberal thing. It's such a dangerous thing, but I think it's ultimately such a human thing that it's kind of scary, you know? It's kind of probably why it takes off.

Speaker 2:          00:59:12       Well, it's, it's also exciting. Yeah. I mean if you want to go to Ferguson, and that's one of the things that I thought was hilarious was, uh, this black eye on Twitter

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       row that the thing that scares me more than the cops in Ferguson is all these white dudes that don't live here, that come down here, that are yelling, fuck the police and that, that are trying to get like, you know what we're talking about social and Brownie points. It's to a rock concert that was, that there's a certain sense of like how fun it is to be a part of something crazy. Yeah. Right. Like, but we've all met those dudes to those, those dudes that try so hard and you know that there's some insincerity that's attached to and they know that if they go there and they put that backpack on, they put their fucking sock beanie on and they, you know, yell out all the right things and get the right fucking youtube videos up. It'll make it look like they're socially progressive and they're a part of the solution.

Speaker 3:          01:00:06       No true. But you know, we had that sort of on our side, like we've been, yeah know, probably been to sporting events or fights or whatever where you like, you feel yourself like kind of overcome by, you know, like how violent it is or how exciting it is or whatever. And like you, you know, it's part of the human nature to like want to belong to something. And I don't blame them for that. I just think they're like stupid. You know, like it's just, it needs to be called out on it. And that's what's going on with this is this, this age of communication that we're in right now. It's there. You can, you can expose. The hypocrisy is you can expose anybody. Anytime you run into someone that's never wrong. When you were running into a liar, it was like people wrong. If they make mistakes, they're incorrect and their assumptions.

Speaker 3:          01:00:47       It's just a part of being a person. To me that's like the most fun though. It's like when you're, when you're like, when you think something so profound like to me like to be a writer, to be a journalist, it's like, it's like an adventure. It's like a quest, you know? Like I, you know, I don't mean to be like too nerdy on this, but like you go on this adventure where you like arrive at something approaching truth and you arrive at like not knowing shit that you didn't know before and some of that stuff can like toppled governments. It can cause elections to change. I mean it can, like you can be pretty revolutionary. Now, let me bring you back to this UVA thing. Sure. So you were the first guy calling bullshit on this or one of the first people. I'm sure there's probably, there's probably like two others.

Speaker 3:          01:01:25       Yeah. And then all of a sudden, you know, you get kicked off Twitter, people are super angry at you. Your own mother is saying, what do you do? An outing rape victims. And did you question your conviction? Did you question whether or not you were correct about it? See, the thing is, is that like I know enough about how the media works that I know that like they need villains, right? Like all of the media, basically their heroes and villains, just like total morality play, even though my boys are the ultimate villain. So like Frat boys, the military, I mean depending on what kind of story you're writing in, the military is either to Hillary hero or the villain, right? Depending, right. So I think human nature is like far more complicated. I think we're both like hero and villain. Like this is part of like what makes us, this is what makes us cool.

Speaker 3:          01:02:05       Like as a species, you know? Um, so like I knew, I knew that the whole thing was bullshit. I offered like 300 bucks to somebody else because I wanted to go and hire other researchers. And I look for people who like flout taboos like to me that one of the things that makes me interested in people is like when they're like, hey, everyone believes this. I believe this and I'm right and they're so confident of it. So anyways, so I knew that this was all bullshit and I knew it was bullshit because of summary reporting. I'd done some other research I'd done, it took me a while to like find the name. It took me a while to find out more stuff, but I just started poking around more. And the thing is like, if you've seen enough of these fake rape pokes, his are enough of these fake like, you know, race hate crimes or whatever, you develop this like weird, I don't know how to describe it.

Speaker 3:          01:02:44       It's like I used to play chess all the time. Um, and you see in chess you see all these games, enough times that you're not even thinking, you're just moving the pieces because you've seen this orientation before. It's like the same thing with these fake crimes. So like I had enough information, I had enough stuff to go on and I have my intuition was like, you know, my spidey sense was going crazy and it became clear to me that like they need a villain in this story. So they're going to look for me. But what it's going to do is it's going to amplify the reach of my website, you know, gotten news and it's going to make it so that they're gonna make me the story, right? They have to. It's just the way the media works. And so I realized it's like a great promotion tool.

Speaker 3:          01:03:21       Like if you have no you, thanks. And then what I'll also do is it will also bring people to me. So like there's a case right now, this kid Tyler coast in Arizona who's like wrongly accused of rape and it's like a whole scandal and it's going to break up. It's going to blow up like probably over the summer. And what's going to happen is all of these weird people are going to come out of the woodwork and they're going to start helping me on other projects. And that's exactly what happened. Um, now how do you know that this kid is not guilty of rape? Because they're all these text messages and messages showing that the girls can aspire to set them up and it's like, it's like pretty sick stuff. What was the one recently where a girl sent a guy a message asking him to fuck her in the ass?

Speaker 3:          01:03:59       Oh yeah. This is the, the mattress girl in, uh, Columbia. What a great kid. She is. She, she sent text messages as guys saved asking Facebook messages. So the, I guess he can't fake them, but you could, someone else could have said them. Someone else could have gotten our coop on our computer and typed them. Right. No. But I mean like there were so many of these messages like in the deposition or the filing that they, that they did to sue Columbia, um, that it's like, it's kind of like outrageous, you know, like some of the stuff that was described, like the sex acts, like stuff that goes, it's pretty like nasty, just disturb stuff. Like I'm not like judging people's sex lives or whatever, but like, it's kind of not the kind of thing that you would expect from somebody who was like, Yo raped, you know, that wants to go and fuck her rapist years later.

Speaker 3:          01:04:45       The problem with the word rape. Okay. Um, rape itself. The idea, when you say the word rape, we think of it as holding someone down or forcing someone to have sex with. Sure. We think of it as a violent act, but there's a lot of progressives, I don't want to call them progressive, but let's just call them social justice warriors that are making these really ridiculous connections between other acts and calling them rape. One of them is having sex while drunk where two people consenting people who are both the same fucking age have sex while they're drinking. And the man is a rapist in California. Occidental University. I'll have that is Russell on the podcast. I love that guys. It's fucking awesome. Love that guy too. And you know, he was a part of this whole thing while it was going down and he's like, this is insane.

Speaker 3:          01:05:32       Well that ruined the kid's life. Ruined the kids' academic career. Kid gets kicked out of school, girls still in school and they just had sex. That's it. There's no, I wasn't, I was at college, I was at Claremont Mckenna out here in eastern La County and I wrote something on my website and the school brought me up before it has a sexual harasser, even though I didn't even name my ex girlfriend by name. I just said my ex girlfriend's a liar, like on my website, on my blog. And they brought me up before the sexual harassment code at Claremont Mckenna. Was it sexual harassment if you accuse a person of being aligned, didn't even use her name. No. And so what they did is, so what I did was I just, I just said, you know, I wrote like my cheating lying ex-girlfriend is reliable source as she a girlfriend, which is to say not very.

Speaker 3:          01:06:12       And then they brought me up, you know, it was brought in actual harasses. Yeah. And so what they did was they wanted to basically investigate my sex life. And so what I did was I had, I had every guy she cheated on me with and I had them go and testify on my behalf. So like, wow. It worked out. And you know, like my girlfriend at the time who's now my wife was like, this is crazy. Like this is stuff that's bananas though. Like this is happening all the time. Like my case is like, by no means. I mean, I wrote about it on my website. Everything. It's by no means unique. Like I can't even tell you how many, since I did the Jackie Coakley Uva thing, I've gotten like hundreds and hundreds of emails from people all around the country that have similar, that have similar like crazy. I could, I could basically dedicate, I actually bought fake rape registry.com because I figure like they might come in handy later on, but the problem is this is a sexist thing that the men are always the perpetrators.

Speaker 3:          01:07:05       The men are always guilty. The men are always the ones that need to be removed, locked up there, the rapists. And when you start saying that, there was another one in New Jersey, they're trying to pass a law saying that if a man and a woman have sex, and it turns out that the man deceived the woman having sex with, they call it. I mean they're, they're trying to make that rape when they dating, isn't it? It's like, well, how about men raped themselves then? Because we've lied to ourselves. Men will lie to themselves about wanting to be monogamous with a girl just so they can get, get her in bed. We lie to ourselves about, yeah, I'm going to settle down with her. And then if you decide, you know what man, fuck this, she's too, too much work, and then you were a rapist.

Speaker 3:          01:07:46       He lied. He knew he didn't want to be monogamous. What about like fat chicks that look for guys who are drunk and passed out? Are they rapists? Right? Like, I mean, what is that? They certainly are, I mean there's a lot of like you could, you could start playing this game. Like in California right now we have affirmative consent. Like that's the law, right? So my wife's means yes, if my wife and I get drunk, right. And then go in like, you know, like a bottle of wine or whatever. And I don't get, I've technically raped my wife. Like that's how like wild the wildest society you guys, even if you have sex with her and she's willing, she's not able to consent. But you know, the whole thing, the Michael Shermer case, do you know that whole, Oh, a case, he was accused of rape because of him.

Speaker 3:          01:08:27       And a girl had had sex when they were drunk and, and she did the language that she used. He got me drunk to a po point where I couldn't consent. And then, you know, there was a guy wrote a blog about it, this asshole of social justice warrior guy that's as a professor and they, you know, the guys name got pushed out as a rapist. I mean there were essentially saying consenting adults having sex is rape because both of them had been drinking, but the man was the rapist because men are evil because it's sexism, it's pure. It's totally, well that's why they're saying that guy who's suing in the mattress girl case, uh, Paul like nuns, Burger, whatever. And by the way, this guy's like, he's like a social justice warrior himself. Like his mother's like, yes, I'm leading feminists and he's the one who needs to know he's the one being accused of rape.

Speaker 3:          01:09:11       And so he's like, you read the messages and he's like the most like passive aggressive. I mean, he's like the liberal, you know, I don't pass in that passive aggressive. And so, you know, he's like, oh, I'm so sorry that I don't like you kind of seven. She's trying to torture him using the system. And so what he did was he said Columbia and it was like, look, you know, uh, uh, title nine, you know, you can't discriminate against men and you're creating an unsafe environment for me here. You're saying you're allowing my rapist. Yeah. This woman accuses me of being a rapist to wander around defaming me even though you found me guilty and your bullshit kangaroo, I mean found me not guilty and your bullshit kangaroo court. So they found him not guilty of rape, like under their administrative policies, which by the way, those things are like, they almost always convict you, right.

Speaker 3:          01:09:52       So he's found not guilty and he sues them and I hope you win. It's like he's going after Ballinger, the guy who's the president there, he's going after the, um, and this chick, you know, she was running around with her mattress saying that her rapist was on campus and he's dangerous to her back. Right. She was at carrying out and stuff. Yeah. She was trying to like, is there like a performance art piece to what a crazy bitch. I really do think. I really do think that by the way, like I think like legitimately, I think like Roosh and some of those like men's rights people are like, I'm not a men's rights guy. Like I, you know, I'm a people's rights guy, you know? Um, but like I think they're right. Like if you don't go to the police and you go to like college administrator shoes, that chicks accused of rape by mattress girl suing Columbia University reveals her damning tax and that's her.

Speaker 3:          01:10:40       Yeah, that's wild. Wow. We're in this like weird states. Kind of cute though. Like go back to that picture again. Just kind of, she's wearing sexy shorts. She should want her legs. She's got heels on or those heels. It's hard to tell. I think they're like clogs or something, but she's got all leg, you know, if a guy was walking around like that with those cutoff shorts, he'd be like that. Gosh, look at her. She's, her jeans are cut so low that are pockets are hanging out underneath the gene, which is always adorable. And she, yeah, she's hot.

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       It's kind of off. It's kind of awkward. I hope we didn't. We didn't mentally. Right. Those aren't, those aren't heels at all. They're like Birkenstocks, which is even more appropriate. It's kind of weird though. Like, can you imagine, can you imagine being like a student and being like accused of this though? Like it's pretty wild. Like it's pretty scary stuff. Well, it's terrifying that we live in a terrifying age and look, kids, when they go away to college, they get drunk and they fuck and they make mistakes and they have sex with people like don't have sex with, that's like the point. But here's the number one thing that's fucked up about this idea of people drinking alcohol, having sex and have that being raped or people, uh, being deceptive and calling that rape. You're just talking about sex. You're talking about consensual sex and you filtered consensual sex into your these parameters and now you're calling it rape and it's people fuck up.

Speaker 2:          01:12:09       People lie. People do. And that's how you find out who to hang out with and who did not hang out with. But the worst case scenario that's happening to these people because they had sex with someone that they regret. That's part of being a person. You find me, someone who has never had sex with someone they regret and I'll find you a person has never taken a fucking chance. Yeah. I mean we, we have ex girlfriends and ex wives for a reason. You know, people out there in the world, right? Like this is like part of life boyfriends or boyfriends or X. Whatever's people fuck up man. You make dumb decisions and you're like, oh my bad. Have you ever talked to a girl ever that said, every guy that I used to date was amazing. They're the best person ever. I'm so happy I fucked them.

Speaker 2:          01:12:48       To know that I've ever blown was the best dude of all time. No, that's not nearly every conversation with a friend who just broke up with his girlfriend is bad and that bitch is crazy. Right? I mean, how about this? Every girl that ever broke up with me was right. She was right at the tone because I'm a different person than it was 20 years old or 18 years old or 30 years old. You fucking grow, you evolve. Totally adapt, change. So this idea that that's rape, that's if someone's deceptive or if someone, the one that drives me the most bananas is the two people drunk together, two consenting adults. And then there was a whole feminist blog that I wrote about that, that if two people are having sex while they're drinking, even if a man is drunk and the woman's sober, the woman raped the man, which is just adorable.

Speaker 2:          01:13:36       It's adorable. It's adorable. First of all, it's not possible because there's not a fucking guy on earth that's going to say that if a woman had sex with him because he was drunk, that he got raped. It's like all those, uh, high school kids, the other where they, where the kid is like 16, 17 and he's like screwing the 24 year old teacher or something like, is that really re like, I mean, I know we're supposed to say it is, but like is it really as a joke that, did he get his dick get hard? Yeah, he's all right. Emotionally. Yeah, he got raped. But guess what? He'll get over it. Who Do? Zach Galifianakis has a great joke about that, about a young man

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       who died because he had sex with his teacher and his friends high fived him to death. I remember there was a case recently of that guy who, uh, he got in to teachers or whatever and they found him bragging about it. That's how they like caught the two teachers cause he was just bragging. It'd be Kinda hard not to like imagine your 17 year old self and you got two teachers at a party. Like it would be hard not to brag about that. Me a 15 year old kid who got blown by his teacher who was good at keeping a fucking secret. You're dealing with crazy people. You're dealing with a woman who is so crazy. She's blowing high school kids. She's having sex parties and drinking with high school kids and having sex with him. And by the way, the ones that get caught, how many of them don't get caught?

Speaker 3:          01:14:55       Oh total. And how many hundred of them are out there running around below in high school? Kids right now. And how many people are really smart and just shut the fuck up about it when they're young. How many of the boys? Yeah, I mean the boys. We had this case, so I went to this prep school and Master's, Milton Academy, you know, probably probably remember from your last mass. Yeah. Milton mass. So scholarship winner there. And we had this like crazy case where we had this chick who like willingly 15 years old, gave head to this guy who we on his 18th birthday and five other guys. I think it's like four other guys. And the school just expelled all of them because of the Romeo and Juliet laws, like if you're 15 or under 16, it's like rape automatically. And so they just expelled all five of these guys.

Speaker 3:          01:15:37       I'm like, no trial, no anything. Just expelled them. Uh, was it, that was an issue when I was in high school, man, I was, when I was 18 years old, when I turned 18 my girlfriend at the time was 17 and her mother was worried that like what we were doing was illegal and she brought it up to me that my mom thinks that you could go to jail for having sex men. I'm like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Like we've been having sex for like seven months or something like that. Like almost a year. It was okay then. And it's not okay today because I turned 18, like I was nervous. I was like, I had, yeah, I remember who I had a conversation with, maybe my parents, but it was like, can I go to jail? Like, cause it's really kidding. Isn't that like an inherently terrifying thought?

Speaker 3:          01:16:18       You know what I mean? Like, so like they're all right, we know this like genetically, right? Like something like one in 10 people are genetic Kuk holds, right? Meaning like your dad is not who your mom says it is. Right. Because like it's not a cold. I thought a cuckold is like you want to watch dudes banging your wife. I don't know what that, I don't think that's kind of a cuckold is somebody who doesn't want that to happen. Who was a dude who has this wife go shagging on other men. That's a different situation. Maybe. Maybe like, I don't know. I mean, but I know the cuckold that I'm talking about might be another second definition that you're talking about. I don't think I've ever, by the way, I only I've ever said that word. I've only like a Shakespearian thing. Yeah. I've only read cock hold.

Speaker 3:          01:16:56       I don't think I've ever said it until this podcast. Yeah. But uh, and so anyway, so don't even, so like one in 10 people, their moms or their dads or not hit her mom says it is. Right. Because humans, we know that like women prefer the Alpha male sperm. But Beta male to raise the kids because the Alpha male will run away, right? So a lot of women we've seen, like in fake rape cases, they'll go and they'll have an affair and they'll say, oh, that guy raped me. Right? And we've seen this happen time and time again and that kind of stuff. Like people lie about stuff. The thing that the people just me off the most about the feminists are like the, the social justice warriors is to say what woman would lie about rape. Like as if it's like some unnatural thing.

Speaker 3:          01:17:33       Like people will lie about all kinds of shit all the time for no apparent reasons. I can't say things like that. What woman to a crazy person. But one would lie about bigfoot. What one would, would lie about Ufo is what woman would lie about anything. Sometimes the crazy, but sometimes it's an a tactical advantage, right? Like there was a case, we did it, uh, University of Hawaii, there was this chick, mckenna facto is her name and she liked, there are two guys, like one who lived in one room, one who lived in the other, you know, like dorm situation and she liked the, you know, the hot, you know, football player guy. Um, and he didn't like her anymore. He was like banging on some other chick, right. And the guy next door was like, uh, you know, she fucked him to get him jealous and then said that this guy next door, like the nerdy guy next door raped her and he was found innocent.

Speaker 3:          01:18:18       He was like clear, but he was like expelled from school at the University of Hawaii. He had to like spend all this money to defend himself and he was found not guilty. You like, you know, one in everything. But imagine like how, I mean that that's like a perfectly human thing. Like who, who, I mean, who hasn't seen situations where somebody will sleep with somebody else to get them jealous, right? Like this is like how humans behave. Like, this is what people love to do, things to get reactions pro or con. Totally pro or con. They love to do wonderful things like bring you flowers to get a reaction or they look to accuse you of things you didn't actually do in order to get a negative reaction or fuck your friends. I mean, how many girls have done that? Fuck her boyfriend's friends when they break up.

Speaker 3:          01:18:59       And that's how super common thing. I've had fucking girlfriends of x book, you know guys who are still good friends, like girlfriends when they break up, come after me and I'm like, get the fuck out of here. And I immediately, we'll call them and tell them, dude, your, your ex girlfriend tries to fuck. She's trying to fuck all your friends. Like I had a situation where I had a friend who like, I dated the girl beforehand and I was like, Oh, you know, my friend is actually better for you than I am. You know what I mean? Like, so I was just like, all right, these people should date. And it was, that was a very healthy of you. I think people, I think that happens a lot more. Like sometimes you're, you realize like this is not right for me. Right. It certainly should.

Speaker 3:          01:19:36       I mean it'd be cool if that's how it worked if, but you know, the only way that does work is if the person is mentally healthy and not lonely. True. You know, the problem is people get lonely and they get sad and they get super depressed at that person doesn't want to be with them anymore. And that sometimes that sense of loss and it's ingrained in our DNA because it's how people stay together, which is how people procreate, which is how the human race expands. Because if it didn't, if you didn't have that sense of loss when someone no longer wants to be with you anymore, then you would have no incentive to improve your personality. He'd have no incentive

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       to get your shit together. No incentive to be a good mate, no incentive, just like hold the reason why people have that feeling when someone wants to leave. That feeling of rejection is terrible because you're your body and your DNA is telling you, hey fuck face, you got to learn how to be a more attractive person. You have to learn how to be more accepted. You have to learn how to figure out a way to be more valuable to mates. And that is one of the problems with social justice warriors, that same instinct to be more valuable and better is what's leading these people to loudly proclaim that they're fiercely feminist. They'll the go after men exclusively not be objective about the situation, not saying hey, you may be these two people got drunk and maybe this girl had sex with a guy and kind of regrets it, but and then in the guy didn't regret it and now lets just accuse this guy of rape because that's what they're doing and stepping forward and proclaiming that this guy's a rapist and writing blog entries about it. All your doing is trying to set yourself aside as being the moral high. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:21:09       but you know there's a biological reason for this. So like there's this great documentary series from Norway. I know it's like kind of random, but there's this document it's called like Javier Nasca translates to brainwash. It's all free online. I highly recommend it. And you spell it like H, j. E r n, a, Google brainwashed Norwegian region documentary you'll find. Okay. Um, and what he does is he interviews all these people, like horseplay, scientists and specialists. I'm like all these taboo subjects. It's really like, it's kind of up your alley. I mean, I think you'd, you'd dig it. Um, but basically there's a section where he talks about how men and women behave after they have casual sex. Both groups will party to want it, right? Because of how we're wired genetically. But women tend to regret it far more often than men to the social consequences for women.

Speaker 4:          01:21:51       Not just, not just like the sociological pressures, but I'm talking about like biological things. Because women, when you, when you have sex with them, they, you know, they, they get oxytocin, they get all the kinds of like basically chemicals in their brains that make them attach to you. I Dunno, maybe, I dunno. Maybe. I Dunno. But, um, yeah, this, this show, I highly recommend it and washed it just like 10 parts in the paradox. Yeah, it's pretty good. So anyways, what's interesting about it is this whole like kind of like brainwashed kind of this, this kind of like brainwashed culture. There's like a biological reason. And if you're a woman and you have sex with a guy and you regret it, and then the campus feminists come in there, the social justice warriors come in there and say you'll regret is actually rape. It's a very like, biological thing that produces this. And then on the other side of it too, you've got this other biological problem, which is that in all animal species, right? Like rape, I mean, animals don't rape each other. I mean, I mean, they do like, that's basically like the whole point of the animal kingdom, right? So like you've got cases where males among primates will go and they'll just, they'll rape some desirable female because they're like the lonely animal and the tribe. You know what I'm saying? So it's like, it's like, um, in our society, if we

Speaker 3:          01:23:05       had some loser dude as a last ditch mating strategy, they'd go and rape. And I think that's like, that explains an awful lot of like the actual violent predatory rape that we see now, that kind of acquaintance rape, you know, I'm writing this down. Gender equality. Parents love it. They're all 10 of the parts. I think they're like 30 minutes a piece or something. They're in somewhat in English, somewhat in Norwegian. He interviews all these people. Um, but the other subtitles is pretty good. The idea that someone could go to jail for something like this or get their life's ruined for something like this, it's just so creepy to me. It's, it's so creepy that sexual attraction and then regret it could lead to someone being accused of a crime, especially a heinous crime like rape, especially in how much money you have to spend.

Speaker 3:          01:23:51       Less so like Alan Dershowitz. So I actually worked for, back in the day was accused of rape by this like crazy chick. We're Virginia Roberts and he's been found like totally innocent and everything, but he's a lawyer, you know, like one of the best lawyers in the country. He spent all of this like attention and money basically defending himself. And that's like a terrible situation because even though he's found innocent, even when people are found innocent, people still kind of wonder, right? Cause you can never know what happens with two people. You can never kind of get that back. You know what I'm saying? Like that's what makes it so hellish. But once you're accused of something is as disgusting as rape. I mean it's very difficult to shake that moniker. I gotta tell you there's a case right now I'm in la that's kind of like getting some attention.

Speaker 3:          01:24:31       I wrote about it a lot, but there's this actress, Pauley Perrette, you know like the NCI s chick, I don't know if you've seen that show, but basically a NCI as she's like accusing her husband. It's like this long drawn out custody or long drawn out like divorce thing. And she's been using the state and her restraining orders to go and hire people to follow her husband around and basically show up so that he gets thrown in jail. Um, yeah, it's like this whole thing. If you Google Coyote Shivers when Kelly paret she, hold on, let me explain. Let me clarify this. So they had a divorce, so like it was like 10 years ago. He married this like hotter check, I think she's like a Brazilian Brazilian journalist or something and he's like moved on with his life. He's this, um, you know, musician type, he lives here in La. And what happened was she created this whole elaborate story, like as a tactical maneuver in the divorce, right?

Speaker 3:          01:25:18       That he like beat her and like created this whole like, elaborate thing. She hired this Pi who's like famous for basically lying and getting, you know, the evidence to help his clients. Right. Nothing wrong with that, you know, in a legal sense, but in a moral sense, it's kind of messed up. And his name's coyote shivers. I've interviewed him a bunch of, posted some stuff and he had nine one one calls that basically proved his innocence. And yet what she did was she hired all these people to go and say, uh, to follow him around. And whenever he goes anywhere she'll then show up cause they'll to, and then he'll be within, you know, within the vicinity or whatever and he'll then have, you know, face a chance of violating the restraining order. So she got a bullshit restraining order. She hired people to basically track this guy around in La and she's a star. Like she's on the top show on television. I've

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       written about this. It got news. Other people have written about this too, but it's like one of the greatest like loss, you know, uh, a restraining order abuses against a guy out there and this guy is facing like 30. Yeah, I think he's facing like a, I think he'd say you seem like a year in prison are a year in jail for violating a restraining order. That was like bullshit Lee obtained and you know, you could interview this guy. Like I vetted him, I've had all these people look into him. Like everything he said to me has checked out. Um, how do you know her interviewed her? So, so I've got, so I've got a lot of the documents that confirm what he's saying and no one's really dug into it. So what she's done is she's used the threat assessment office of the LAPD, which is like basically a bunch of star fuckers.

Speaker 4:          01:26:41       Like they love celebrities. And so they tried to make it like this guy who's also kind of like a minor celebrity, they tried to use him and say like he's a stalker or whatever to advance their power and interest when it's really just a dispute that they had. And they got into an argument like is couples do, he divorced her and he then married somebody else. She was all like upset about this and she, she hired people to basically torment this guy. Um, and it's like no, that he wasn't a dick, that he wasn't a beating or whatever. There was no record of that. There's no record of anything. There was no record as far as her going to the hospital or no record of like abuse, no record of like, you know, of him hurting her in court. Actually they suggested that he sat on her, you know, but that the other than the court, then the lawyer kind of retracted that. I mean basically there's no evidence, physical evidence whatsoever that he was like beating her.

Speaker 2:          01:27:33       I have with that is there's a lot of women that don't want to admit that there man beats them. They should freak out about it or there's a mutually abusive relationship and the man takes it too far and they don't, don't ever go to the hospital about it. I don't think

Speaker 4:          01:27:47       that's the case here. I mean, you would have to drill down on the particular, cause I've written about this a bunch already. It's been 20 months, but you have to communicate with her. I have, I've reached out to her. I've got, I mean all of the documentation that's in the case supports this guy's side of it. And she has said things that contradict the documentation that's out there. Like, uh, she said that she feared for her life and she called the nine one one nine one one call and I posted the audio of that and it showed like she wasn't, you know, freaking out or anything. She was very calm. She was like trying to get her husband right. I mean there's a lot of physical evidence in the case. You should, I mean you could, you should. I mean not to tell you what to do your podcast, but he's somebody you should have on, cause he's kind of, he's kind of an interesting guy.

Speaker 4:          01:28:24       He's been, you know, he was like a total liberal kind of guy and he's been like dealing with the trauma of this. Um, and there's, I mean if you go to God news, I've kind of written it out and kind of more detail, but there's a lot of evidence to kind of point me. I tend to be very suspicious of men who are like accused accused of beating in general because like, yeah, like a calm, cause it's common like people do it, you know, like a friend of mine, actually, I'm not a friend of mine, but you know, like a Twitter friend of mine, uh, Todd king cannon who was a famous kind of Republican guy is wailing on his wife for a long time and you know, was apparently arrested for it. So like I, I, I don't discount that, that, that happens, but the, the, the evidence that's gone on here, the number of, you know, um, different civil rights groups have got involved in a number of researchers got involved. There are a lot of people who are like, this guy could go to jail for a year on trumped up charges. Um, and it's kind of wild, but, but again, you know, you never really know, like this gets to what we were saying earlier, right. You never really know what goes on with two people.

Speaker 1:          01:29:19       Right. Right. When he'd go to the girl with the mattress on her back, it's obvious that it does happen. Sure. Obviously there's some people that are fucking crazy. There's also some people that want to do that Glen close thing. I'm not going to be ignored. I will not be ignored. Like you, they don't, someone doesn't want you to just move on with your life. You know, some men and women women after they just go crazy. Yeah. There's certain people that, that feeling that they get, that we discussed before when someone rejects you, that horrible feeling of loss and it's like God, which is nature trying to get you to do some deep fucking soul searching and figure out how to be a better mate

Speaker 4:          01:29:58       drug thing too, right? When you're getting, when you're fucking on the regular, you know, you get certain brain chemicals released, you know, you feel good about yourself, right? Like I mean, that's what the whole like when you first fall in love, you're getting all that Aussie Towson into your brain, which is like a narcotic. Like it's uh, you know, it's an actual like, and then when you stop getting that, you go through withdrawals. Right? And that's what you, that's why you feel like physically like your body hurts, right? Like that's what that is and you've got to go and build yourself up to be a better mate. But a lot of people unfortunately don't. And then then the sad thing is then they start using the legal system or their power or their money or whatever to then fuck with the other person.

Speaker 1:          01:30:36       Yeah, it's dark, it's dark. What people are capable of doing and deception and the fact that they can plot and conspire to have someone locked up for something just to sort of have an impact on their life.

Speaker 4:          01:30:45       And I don't think it's like uh, I don't think it's always an everywhere, a malicious thing. Cause I think sometimes you go, you just go crazy. Like I mean we've all had bad breakups where we are like we don't recognize ourselves. Like the actions that we're doing like don't seem rational.

Speaker 1:          01:30:58       Well also there's some people that have some sort of crazy aspects of their personality. They are attractive because they're wild and impulsive and you hold off it when you first start dating him. You know, like if you're dating a girl and she pulls her pants down in the parking lot and he's, come on, let's do it. And you're like, wow, this is crazy. People are going to see us. I don't care. Fuck me, whoa. That's a crazy bitch is going to walk around campus with a mattress on her back. You know, like that kind of, and you don't really think about it, you know. Yeah, you're exactly right. Like sometimes the things that draw you to them or the things that ultimately repel you from them. Right? Like you know, my friend Tony's Arrow, he says that that's psychotic and erotic or basically the same thing expressing themselves and just different ways that like the, the girls who are the most erotic and crazy in bed or on their fucking bananas. Like he only dates crazy girls cause they're fun. Yeah. I mean I got to tell you, like said, I'm coming up with my two year anniversary of being married. I got to tell you like the faster I got rid of the crazy in my life to happier I was for sure. Well, especially when you recognize the consequences of that crazy. No

Speaker 4:          01:31:57       financially like debilitating. When you're,

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       when you're dating crazy people, they can't, it can be, it certainly can just drive you. It can be pretty bad. Why don't you just gotta be aware of the consequences, not just jump to the deep end of the pool. You gotta share. Just tread slowly like dancing on dynamite though. Like it really is. And a lot of guys think like, no, no, no, I can control this shit. And like, no, no, no, no, no. Like there's a legal system that's got to get you. Certainly if someone's inclined to sue and my God, I mean anybody that finds out about mattress girl and, and then still decides to date or after that. But what a glutton for punishment. You must be. I would, I would be fascinated to interview that guy. Like I wouldn't, wouldn't, wouldn't you be like, what would you, I mean, what was going to be cooking at Uva girl, let's go back to the rolling stone sharing this because we'd never really completely completed it.

Speaker 1:          01:32:45       I'm completely completed this. Um, you were the guy who were one of the people that called bullshit on this. Yeah. And when it all fell apart, which took a long time. Yeah. It was a delayed reaction. Well, like three or four months, but yeah, it took a long time. Yeah. I mean there's, this whole thing was a huge story and you know, uh, yes, all women and all that shit went down there that, that bothered me a lot too. That was, yes. All women than me about that that guy killed more men than he did women. And everybody was like, yes. All women. Like what does it need? You're dealing with a psycho, whatever happened to just like plain crazy like people are that are just nuts. Like it's not even a political thing like whatever happened to just like this guy is nuts. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:33:28       But this, the whole focus became, instead of his mental health issues, does the guy in Santa Barbara, the for the focus became that this whole thing was about men's rights activists and pickup artists who have fucked with this guy's head and gotten him to objectify women and that women have to deal with this guy kind of person on a regular basis. It's just a nonsense. Completely ignoring the fact that this guy murdered four men and two women and he stabbed more people than he use guns to people who were trying to ban guns doing that. But the whole thing was just so completely fucked up. Like how can you, and I saw that there's so many social justice where he couldn't, one guy that I respect wrote this article, this Hashtag yes. All women article. I'm like, Jesus fucking Christ dude. You're dealing with a person with obvious mental illness problems and the fact that you're writing.

Speaker 1:          01:34:18       Yes. All women when he murdered men as well. It's just crazy. It's sexist. It's fucking sexist is, and it's sad too because like there's so many people out there who had lake legit and mental health issues that like we shouldn't be putting them into a like, uh, into like a political or social or religious lens. Exactly what you just be like, we should just get these people help. Right. And we should try and identify them, not give them guns. Right? Like I think we, you know, those of us who are pro guns, we should recognize that like there's the people who shouldn't have guns. Um, not that we should be overly restrictive about gun Ross because I think a lot of people in Maryland right now kind of wish they could have concealed carry, you know, um, yeah, in Baltimore or whatnot. But we should be like, we should stop

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       trying to politicize everything and try to like help people. And the thing is when you start like framing these things as political discussions rather than like, hey, like this guy's crazy, like we should help him

Speaker 2:          01:35:10       and it's a power grab for Social Brownie points. Is this God that I know that I respect, that wrote this article. He's a fucking Dork. He's a Dork. And I've seen, you know, I mean I say that with all love, but he's just as super nerdy guy who's very weak and this is signaling thing. Hollowness, peacock feathers. Yes.

Speaker 4:          01:35:29       It's all, I mean this is where monkeys, right? Like we're, we're like, you know, we are primates or whatever we want to say, put, you know, the Pc version of it all monkeys signal like all of them socially, they, you know, that's what the gorilla does this for. Like this is what, this is what this is and what they're doing is they're using the, the taboos of the society to show to women that they're virtuous and that therefore they're deserving of female attention. And you know, they don't know that they're doing that. I'm sure they see like a political lens to it, but that's what they were doing.

Speaker 2:          01:35:58       Absolutely. I mean, this is also, by the way, while heinous, horrific acts are going on all throughout the world that these people are conveniently ignoring. Like she's not, they're not focusing on the Congo. Then I focusing on, there's like a real rape culture, a real rape called total. I focusing on Afghanistan. They're not writing articles and some of the most heinous activities of the human race. They're writing articles about this one thing that's in the news and then they're using it to focus on one very specific aspect of that thing. Not to mental illness as the gender aspects of it.

Speaker 4:          01:36:29       Easy man. Like I mean I watched all these videos, I read every article, Sabrina Reuben early wrote like I watch all the videos that I could find of her. I like, yeah, like it was hard to do this shit. Like, you know what I mean? And it's easy just to be like, yes, I'll live in a, you know, 140 and it's hard to go to like see the rape rooms in like you know it and you shitty countries. Right. It's hard to get access to it. And then the people who do get access to it, it doesn't trend on Twitter. Nobody really sees it, you know, which is the sad side of like our media landscape.

Speaker 2:          01:36:57       What is the consequences for the woman who was a false rape accuser? Well, there's no victim cause there's no real guy. She pointed to write the [inaudible] fraternity

Speaker 4:          01:37:05       was vandalized. I think something like $100,000 worth of damage was done. Like people saw that as an excuse. This is the thing that scares me, right? This is like, I don't like the Hitler reductive added Hitlarian thing, but like, you know, like the Kristallnacht thing when people were like targeting Jews, right? Like there's a certain aspect of this where like it becomes okay to hate certain people and to be kind of, because it's okay to hate them. It's okay to harm them. And we are seeing this with like, you know, attacks on the police in Baltimore right now we're seeing this with a tax on fraternities. I mean if you, the social justice warriors are honest about this. They say like, we want to destroy fraternities in this country. It's like bastions of male power, right? Like that's what they're trying to do. That's why you saw it. You remember that? Uh, like a video a while back at Oklahoma where the, you know, the Frat boys were saying some racist shit. Like, which was like, you know, we've all been in environments where people said Shit that like

Speaker 1:          01:37:55       probably shouldn't be broadcast to the entire world. Right? Like, we've all been, we've all been like, I'm not saying, well, you know, the Donald Sterling thing isn't, he is a good example of this, like a private conversation. I mean, if you can't have a private conversation with your mistress, who can you have a private conversation with the Donald Sterling thing? She's as Christ. I mean, I had a bit about it in my act because it was so ridiculous. He's asking her to not take pictures of the black guys in the same sentence. He said, I don't care if you fuck them. The joke I had, my act was, could you imagine if it was the opposite way? If he said, I don't mind if you take pictures of the black guys, but I don't want you to fuck on. People would be like, that's pretty reasonable. You know?

Speaker 1:          01:38:32       I think it's kind of how another, it's racist because it wasn't one or taking pictures with them. Like the whole thing is nuts. The whole thing was nuts. They took that guy's fucking team away. I think he did it deliberately. I have this whole theory about how it's like, how was like an elaborate play to like sell the team. I mean he increased the rent. Oh, if you look at like when he bought it, he's not that bright. If you've ever heard of the talk, he's a fucking billion. He's a financial genius but not socially. I'm sure. I'm sure there Kate. I mean he, I think he got back with the chick too. I could be wrong on that, but I think he got back with her. He should. You know why? Cause she's getting sued by his fucking wife. She's losing everything that she's going to be broke as a joke.

Speaker 1:          01:39:07       His wife is going after money that she donated to charity. Like when she bought things with a credit card and they can give away $5 for breast cancer. She wants that money to, she's divorces ugly. Well, the wife has just going after this cunt. I mean like this chick, like the wife is going after her because she can and because she can, she can break her. She can show her. Yeah, you might be able to fuck my husband because you're young and pretty, but guess what I can do. I had lawyer million dollars and I'm going to sue you into the ground and if I lose I'm going to sue you for something else and I'm going to keep going until you got no fucking money. It's kind of wild, isn't it? It's crazy to me. This is, this is our legal system right now, but I mean in some ways the legal system is super important to have.

Speaker 1:          01:39:54       It's important. If somebody victimizes you, you have a, you have recourse. Sure could. You could get that money but you can get it back. But those shitting get victimized. She, she had a husband that was fucking the hot young girl and buying or condos and Byner Mercedes or whatever the fuck he bought or of Jaguars or Bentleys or whatever the fuck it was. But it's, it's the whole thing is kind of hilarious when it's all played out in front of you. Yeah. You would think it would be like, yeah, you would think it was like a Tom Wolfe novel or like you would think it's like some kind of fun play or something. But I mean like with the Jackie Coakley situation at the University of Virginia, right. I thought it was kind of racist that we all like know Twana brollies name but not Jackie Coakley. Like people didn't want to name her. Well Tawana Brawley though came out publicly. Sure. But this is a big difference. And then she did too. Like she participated in, in a story. Right? Like a lot of the Times that, you know, if it was so important to keep on a bit reluctant, I mean she wasn't cold so we're told now. Right. But like, I mean I'm sure there's some power that comes with being I, it was brought up before

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       Congress, like they tried to pass like laws based upon this grow based upon Emily Renda who was her friend who apparently has this whole other problem with her own rape story where she was allegedly raped but they're like conflicting accounts on that. But like the thing that bothers me about this is not, is not the girls cause I do, I think there something like mentally ill with Jackie, like Jackie's clearly bipolar. Like a lot of the people I've talked to who know her says she's just not, well the thing that bothers me is there's this desire by a lot of like journalists now to go and shop as, as Sabrina Reuben early put it to shop around looking for victims. Right. Rather than to like tell the complexity of like, you know, an actual fight that goes, I mean what they do is they reduce people to like characters in there like agit prop play, right.

Speaker 4:          01:41:38       Rather than like get into like the motivations and the psychology and they don't really, like, they don't really need to do the actual work. They basically use the gang rapes or the [inaudible] sensationalist things to basically push people emotionally manipulate them to, to like advance an interest or an agenda. And what's happening right now on college campuses is there eliminating due process rights for men? And like, I was a nerd in college, like I'm a nerd now, right? Like nobody was asking me to join a fraternity. Like I live with football players and I like, you know, I saw the progression, you know, the, the procession of hot women that came in and tried to fuck them. Right. Um, like I, you know, I saw this, but the, and I'm not like trying to like defend some of the boarish behavior that like football players and Frat guys have.

Speaker 4:          01:42:22       Like, we all know there's some stuff that goes on there that's probably like probably not the coolest stuff in the world, right? Absolutely. But we also know that some women are attracted to Borsch men of course, because those are, that's what I, yeah, it was just good old war. And those are the men that defend them. And those are the, the violence aggressive manner, attractive to their jeans. You can't have a society, you can't, on the one hand, have a society that tries to turn us all into basically feminized men and then hope that things will work out. You need burly, disturbed men to go and break stuff. You know, like, this is what you need in this society. And if you're just constantly putting upon them and constantly, it's not gonna, it's not gonna work out. Well, this movie does not, does not go well.

Speaker 1:          01:43:01       Yeah. Uh, this Uva thing, so Rollingstone publishes this store and with very little vetting of the facts and just violate it all the laws of journalism, which is, it was so disturbing because rolling stone is this iconic magazine that in my mind is ultimately connected with hunter s Thompson and Matt tie eat totally pisses me.

Speaker 4:          01:43:25       They pissed me off when they put the cover of the fucking terrorist on the cover. Yeah. Like my sister, my sister was there 20 minutes beforehand and when he did that I was like, fuck them, I'm done with this

Speaker 1:          01:43:33       place. Well they didn't just put him on the cover. If they put him on the cover handcuffed being, you know, covered in blood. Like they found him under that boat. Tarp. Yeah. That would be one thing. They put a glamour shot of him. Yeah. He's a cute kid, you know, and yeah. And then you had all these fellows. This is what we're getting at. Yeah. I

Speaker 4:          01:43:50       was like women boarish men. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       So like they were going all these chicks like the free, you know, Free Dzhokhar Siren. I have brigade on Twitter who are like, oh, he's so hot. Like there are all these people have all these chicks like high school checks on Twitter who are like, oh, he's so hot. He's so dreamy. He's all this. Oh yeah. It was like diff of stuff like, uh, uh, I mean it just goes to show you that women have, you know, some women have no taste and just fucking around, you know, so I don't know that some of them were fucking around though. Like there was some stuff that was done. Yeah. Like this is what happens. He's an attractive kind of guy. Um, but that, that pissed me off. And then then with the rolling stone stuff, what I discovered about a lot of journalism out there that you see all the time is that it goes through very little fact checking.

Speaker 2:          01:44:30       And the Sabrina Reuben Eardley is like a prime example of this. But we've got, there are many examples of this. You could, you can shoot down a lot of articles these days. Yeah. Well you certainly, I can shoot down that one. You know, that that article is a rough one and that that article being in rolling stone was so disappointing to a lot of people that it was, a lot of people canceled the Rolling Stones Subscriptions, I'm sure because of it. I mean it's, it's one of those things where you, you're always going to have to wonder about any scathing report that they published in that magazine

Speaker 4:          01:44:58       now. But you know, there's no story, there's no story without Jackie Coakley talking to Sabrina Reuben Eardley so why does she go and talk to her? Because Emily Renda, who's like trying to push this campus rape agenda story, you know, this kind of rape culture fantasy. She was, she was, she was shopping around for victims and there's no story without Jackie Coakley and note, and she lied. I mean, she lied repeatedly. She realized about the guy even existing, she hadn't talked to the photo of the guy that she had seen in all these years. Like there's just, I mean, you have to vet your sources, you have to vet people that you talk to. And none of that was done because the story was too good. It was too sexy. Well, it's one of those things, this story where you,

Speaker 2:          01:45:40       you can't, you can't question a woman who says that she was involved in a rape. Because if you do, you become a rape apologist. You become a part of the problem, you become, there's all, I mean you could talk to a bunch of different negative monikers to it and uh, that sort of, that hands off non objective approach to one very specific thing. If you talk about a man who has been beaten up, you know, and a man who is a violence has been perpetrated on you, you, you can ask all sorts of questions. But if it's a woman and it's sexual,

Speaker 4:          01:46:13       why do you think, I mean, so I've been thinking about this, I've been having this debate with a friend of mine, right, about the Rape Shield law, right? Cause you know, like in a lot of newspapers, a lot of newspapers do this. Like, you know, by design they say like they don't mention the name of the woman, right? Whenever there's a rape allegation, they say, you know, this woman was raped, she's turning 19 whatever. They never tell you like her name. And I always feel really uncomfortable with this because it provides a great shield to do damage to somebody. Right? Like if you, if you don't identify the name of a victim supposed victim, it's an alleged victim. We haven't had a trial yet. We haven't had conviction yet. We haven't had anything. Right. And when people we know are doing power place to kind of like screw people over, I mean I posted an article of 13 women who lied about rape, um, or you know, on my Twitter page and like I think the rape shield idea existed like in a time before kind of the sexual revolution.

Speaker 4:          01:47:06       So it made a lot of sense then like when a woman's virtuousness or you know, not having sex was prized, but like we're in 2015 like most people are having sex before marriage, right? Like a lot of people, you know what I mean? Like it seems kind of weird that we still have this thing where we keep the name of the victim. It's an alleged victim, but they always pretend like it's a real victim and we don't know that yet. Like there hasn't been. And it seems like if we named, if we named the women, you know, like, hey, so and so's accusing such and such of this crime. Um, and we just named them like we do for attempted murder like we do for all kinds of cases. Um, I think we would get fewer of these fake rape incidents. But on the,

Speaker 2:          01:47:48       do you also think though that we would get few real rape accusations of actual rape because women don't want to be shamed. There's some woman that's a shame of, of, of coming out publicly about an actual real rape. It actually prevents them from going after a real rapist. That's a fact. So we're told, yeah, I mean that's not, so we're told there's, I mean this is let people that have actually been raped where it's totally fun, they've been raped, have said that they were reluctant shock about it because of the shame that comes on them. The shit that gets put on them because of the situation where a woman who gets raped, it's very different than a woman getting beat up or a man getting geed up or any other situation when a person gets raped. It's a shameful, horrible feeling that this person has to deal with publicly. They have to be publicly humiliated by the fact that this guy sexually use them, held them down. It's not just about a woman was assaulted if a woman's assaulted. That's one thing. And it is, it does have to do with our, our unusual connection with sexuality. We have this, this thing about sexuality. There's this sort of demonization and this

Speaker 4:          01:48:56       right. Women either had are whores or uh, you know, or uh, or nuns, right? Or Saints, you know, like that. There's kind of like this, uh, kind of like in the post sexual revolution era where like not sure if w if women should be virtuous, if they should be the same as men, we're not really sure what to, what to make. I mean, I've thought about this though. Like I would never shame a woman. Like if somebody came to me and they were like, you know, I was raped, or like, you know, my sister or friend or whatever, I wouldn't be like, you know, shaming them. I don't know that like, I don't know that the shame thing really is as true as it once was. Maybe it's still there and maybe you're right about that, but like you wouldn't shame a curl, right? Like who came to you and said that she was raped. You pick, oh my God. Like I'm sorry, like, you know, anything. I can do a slot. Of course not. But what kind of man would do that? I mean, not to say that, not to say that that wouldn't happen.

Speaker 2:          01:49:43       Well, this isn't a lot of shitheads out there though. Whenever you go public, you expose yourself to

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       all people and out of all people, there's going to be a certain percentage of them that I love to use this term. The 1% you know, the 1% everyone always wants to use the 1% in terms of like the judges and the bankers, but the 1% of people are just fucking cunts. And 1% of men, 1% of women, this is 1% one out of a hundred magnified on Twitter, aren't they? They're magnified when you get a public exposure to millions. Well, if you're dealing with 300 million people, the United States population, whenever the fuck it is, you're dealing with 3 million cuts and if there's, and if there's one in a million, there's still 300 cons. Yeah, that's a lot. That's a lot. I mean one in a million is a ridiculously optimistic outlook. Of course it's way more than that. It's probably one in a hundred if you get to be together with a hundred people, especially when you add anonymity at the anonymity that the Internet provides or you don't have the social consequences of being questioned for your behavior, your tweets, or it's like being, it's like being on the freeway and being a shitty driver.

Speaker 3:          01:50:48       Right? Cause nobody can identify. It's the same kind of thing. There's a lot of that, but at least they can see you and look in your eyes and see your car, right. Your plate down and gives us some jumbled the series of numbers and letters. It's your Twitter account, you're an asshole on it, you know, and you can do it anonymously and you can get away with it. So if you find out that someone has been accused of something or some woman is a crime, like rape has been perpetrated against her, what's the stop? Some anonymous fuckhead from just harassing them and going after them. And a lot of people have like made of, you know, they've made a, a strong habit of doing that to people. Yeah. Well let's take, let's take it a good example. Like, so I was reading John Krakauer's book and Missoula, which is like about this campus rape phenomenon and in Montana, University of Montana, this is a phenomenon.

Speaker 3:          01:51:34       He says there's a phenomenon going on, but he's at the University of Montana. He lives in Montana. So I seen him, he was just interviewing people, but they're there like five or six anecdotes of like rapes. And one of the cases is this guy who was a football player who in 2012 was found not guilty of rape. It was like brought before the courts and everything he was, he was exonerated and Krakauer wants has got to be expelled even though the court system found him innocent and he's created this like um, anonymous identity for this chick, her name, he calls her Washburn, like her, I forget her first name in the book, but like there's this case, you know, University of Montana where the guys found innocent and even after he's found innocent, he's still being tortured with being called a rapist. He's still being tortured with calling, you know, being called.

Speaker 3:          01:52:18       And I think I got to say like damaging accusations of rape. Rape is like a serious, terrible crime. It's like as, as Dershowitz has put it, it's the most falsely reported crime, but it's also the most under reported crime that we sort of have in our society. Blot. On the other hand, like it should be a big deal to accuse somebody publicly. You should, I mean, under the sixth amendment of the United States constitution, you have a right to confront your accusers. How can you confront them if the trials occurring the media without your ability to even respond to the non, you know, anonymous allegations. So it's kind of like, it's like a trade off thing and it's really difficult to make the balance. Anyone who says definitively like I have the answer for you on this stuff, she totally full of shit because it's really hard to know what to do.

Speaker 3:          01:53:00       You know like should we not write about the University of Montana case where this guy was found not guilty because he's now been found not guilty even though he may have raped her. Right. We don't know. Just because the court system decides something. We know there are many cases where courts get things wrong. Somebody on Twitter pointed out something really good, but I need to adjust the white people that rioted in the hockey riots have a Vancouver. I was actually there for that. I was there right before that went down. I left just before the riots. It was, well I didn't see the riots, but I had been in the town. I was like, there's so nice up here. How the fuck are they riding? So somebody had a good point. White people do. Right. But it's all over sporting events and it's over relatively quickly.

Speaker 3:          01:53:40       We're not only that, the people that riot, we're so fucking stupid. They were doing it while everyone was taking pictures and posting it on social media and a giant chunk of them went to jail, like a giant chunk of them got arrested for it. Take for you to actually write it. I've always, I've always, I asked my wife this the other day, I was like, well what do you like, why would we riot honey? You know, like, I can't imagine a scenario in which I'm like burning things down, destroying people's property. Well, you're not poor, true, poor and desperate and you don't, there are lots of poor people. Those, a downside future like, right. No, definitely. But I think that's a big part of it. I mean the, the, the writing and the hockey riots, those are fucking retards. I think it's a young man thing too though.

Speaker 3:          01:54:20       For sure. Yeah. It was all a whole lot of young women out there rioting a video, uh, which is making the rounds, um, called good morning, good morning, Baltimore. You know, like that old, we did a video where we took all of the, the shots of the rioters and put it to like this music and it's like, it's really like, it's fucking, it's perverse, but it kind of funny. Um, but I think, I dunno man, like there's something, I think there's something tribal about us as people that like, you know, I've, I've had, I've had this experience at tri at like sporting events or like at political events where you feel something like overcome you. And I'm like pretty rational, you know, nerdy guy, you know, high Iq and the bell curve kind of thing. But like there's something if, if I'm drawn to it and we're all drawn to it, like then the people who are really like dumb and poor and don't have a lot of options and yet they all have smartphones.

Speaker 3:          01:55:11       Like it gets really scary. I can certainly, damage can be done. Well, there's without a doubt there's a certain aspect of human beings that allows us to go with the flow of big movements when there's big things that are happening, there's horrific things that happened in large groups and mass groups. It just wouldn't happen when there's one person is a weird thing and I think the sporting events like thing of the white people that riot. I think that that is like what I'm talking about like part of this tribe and you're just like boils over cause when you have a whole lot of like you know shit heads together like we were talking about earlier, like 1% of them are going to be assholes or whatever

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       and I'm sure it starts really slowly like one guy break something and then everyone else starts breaking shit. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:55:49       Well think that's also speaks to what we're talking about, the incredible difficulty of escaping from a ghetto because we imitate our atmospheres and we maintain our atmosphere. Atmosphere is boiling over into mad violence and rioting and looting. There's a lot of people that just succumb to that influence and just give in and be overcome. I don't think we're nearly as autonomous as we like to think we are. I think we are a giant super organism and we have our own individual identities inside the super organism.

Speaker 4:          01:56:18       Wilson says that he says we're like ants like as a species. Um, you know, the great biologist, evolutionary biologist, he says that we're basically a soup.

Speaker 2:          01:56:26       Well, it's not just us, it's pretty much every organism. How do you think those birds fly together in these giant flocks and go left and right and move around like, like, like they're like, they're all being controlled. How does it happen with fish? How does it go with all sorts of animals that exist in pastoring? Totally. Yeah. We, we have, you know, we, we, we have groups and these groups act as a unit and when the group riots, I think people become incredibly compelled to become a part of that. And it takes amazing resolve and intelligence if you're a trapped in that to avoid the influence of that.

Speaker 4:          01:57:02       Sure. But like, so like take the case, like there was a famous sociological experiment where we took, we gave blacks in the ghetto. We gave them like section eight vouchers to like get the hell out of the ghetto. Right. And we started, it was like an Atlantic article on this like maybe four or five years ago. But what happened was was that we gave all these section eight vouchers to get out of the ghetto. Right. And what happened? Like people got out of the ghetto and then they started committing crimes like in their new area. So like we gave everyone, you know, like whatever the rental equivalent is and then you can move into like a nicer area and they brought the crime with them. So that just goes to show like how much it's like a part of you once you grow up in it or how much it's a part of your brain.

Speaker 4:          01:57:40       You know, like, so this book I'm reading right now, this is like the best book I've read in like 10 years. It's called sapiens. And it's about basically what makes humans like, what made us different from all the other, you know, homos or I guess animal almost. You know, I'm a erectus homo neanderthal or whatever. And what he says is there's this thing that we have as humans where we take on fictions, like we believe certain isms and that becomes like most primate species. It's like, you know, a few people are in your tribe and are in your group. You know, like humans. I think it's like 150 maximum. That's like the Max size of uh, of, uh, of a tribe. Um, but what happens is that we all start to like believe certain narratives about the world in our brains. We're getting kind of like brainwashed or whatever and then we start to act on our commitment to that fiction that we've created.

Speaker 4:          01:58:26       And it's kind of wild. Like when you think about it, like there's so many fictions in your society, so many things you unconsciously believe so many ism, you know his isms. But also like things like joint stock companies or like legal documents. I mean all of law, if you think of it as just a fiction, we all agree on it's the same kind of thing. And his book is really kind of like challenged a lot of my thinking on this because like, you know, if you're in the, if you're creating this mindset that like people are so put upon, so put upon, so put upon, they'll start to act like they're so put upon, right? Cause it's like there they get infected, their brains get infected and it becomes really hard to persuade people particularly it's like it's pretty self serving. If you just say like you're in the ghetto and you're fucked because like, you know, there are many examples of people like surviving out of the ghetto, people moving out of the ghetto.

Speaker 4:          01:59:09       There are many like human beings are much more malleable I think then of like, you know, escaping from terrible circumstances and yet what we do as a society as we say, like, no, you're fucked. Like you're done. You know, you're never going to end it. Like we should be like thinking about waste so we can orient the society. So they're more options. But like it's really hard. People are more malleable. But I disagree that people are more malleable when it comes to the ability to escape the ghetto. I think there's everything is stacked against you. If you're in that environment financially it's tacked against you as far as the behavior that you're imitating, your atmosphere around all those, the fear affects too, like your fear of friends and stuff. It's not like you live in Irvine and you know your family's of moderate income and you figure out a way to make it so it's nothing that's really weird to me.

Speaker 4:          01:59:52       Like I did a lot of reporting on the Ferguson stuff and the thing that was really weird to me are like where'd these affluent black kids who are like coming in like slumming in the ghettos of Ferguson? And like, I'd never seen anything like this. I mean, so like there were a number of like black radical activist types of can Chicago and the suburbs there who basically like, you know, black guys who his parents are like doctors, lawyers, whatever. You know, like people who like, you know, not, I mean you know, not obviously not every black person is kind of like living in the ghetto. I mean there are lots of dumb, we live, you know, whatever. Right. So what was interesting about this is there all these cases of like to be like authentically black. These kids who were like, you know when to fancy schools went to good schools or whatever, they felt they had to go and participate in like you know the anti-cop protests or the, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          02:00:36       Like but isn't that also possibly because they recognize that they were lucky and they want to help maybe yeah, you could be right. Like I hadn't thought of it that way. I think you may be right but I I maybe on the other hand, I mean yeah you probably are right about that to a certain extent. I'm sure there's a motivation of that but I also think it's kind of weird too that your parents give you all these options, right? To escape the ghetto and you returned to the ghetto as like a, you know, to like, cause trouble, like in their mind they're not causing trouble. They're there in their mind they're trying to enact some sort of change. True. True. To a certain extent. Yeah. What's going on Aaron? Greer? Baltimore. Not Mom beats the mom who rescued. Uh, she saw her son on the TV and went after him. She beating the shit out of them. I liked, I liked that. I mean, I think it's good. I think if people took more responsibility for their own, for their family members, you know, like if you saw, if you saw like your friend on TV, right? And you'd be like, dude, like don't write.

Speaker 4:          02:01:30       I don't like the beading thing though. I'm not cool on. That's probably the only way to get this. He's got a mask on. Oh yeah. I mean, I don't agree with the beating either, but fuck, the whole thing is Iraq. What do you think's going to happen in Baltimore? Yeah. Well ultimately, I mean I'm sure they have the national guard's down there now and there was probably going to Bli on, so we'll escalate and then like Ferguson will eventually calmed down. But do you know what really pisses me off though and this whole thing, there are all these people who are like trying to spin it politically. How so? Like all of these people were like, it's true. Like there hasn't been a Republican mayor of Baltimore since like the 60s or whatever, but they're like, liberals did this, liberalism did this. Like there are lots of places that are run by liberals that are like perfectly fine places to live and go to boulder, Colorado.

Speaker 4:          02:02:15       Yeah. It's all liberals. Nobody gives a shit. Everybody's nicest shit. Or West west side La, Seattle or Boston, you know, like Asheville, North Carolina, liberal places that are great. Yeah. Yeah. It's not a liberal or Republican thing. It's a poor people thing. It's a lack of hope thing. It's a crime thing. It's a poor people too. To him of the environment thing. We have a whole lot of poor s Asian people like you know, in the San Gabriel valley, we have a whole lot of poor ass Mexicans. We have a poor la boats all sized right to the heart of what happened in the first place. It's so fucking police brutality is. Sure. I mean we don't know what the fuck happened. We don't have a video in this one, but we do have a video of that guy running from the cop and getting shot from behind.

Speaker 4:          02:02:55       Sure. You know we have that one from South Carolina. Yeah, Walter Scott, we case. Yeah. You know we have a series of of that. We have the 12 year old kid that had the fucking toy gun where the cops pulled the car over and just shot him. Sure. We have a lot to put yourself in that case. Right. And that example of the Tamir Rice situation, right. Kid with a fake gun, fake gun. So that area is like known for having people with, with those types of guns, robbing people. Right. It's known as like a really shitty part of town. You're getting reports of somebody who's like running around in a park with a gun, right? The kamikaze known for being an overbearing over violent cop who was released from another police force and they didn't want to have to retrain him. So desired and another cop, bad cop, no doubt about it.

Speaker 4:          02:03:37       But, but in any population of anything, you're going to get shitty teachers, good teachers, bad cops, good cops. You know, the system that you build should be built towards like trying to assess the worst case scenarios. Right? And like in some of these cases, like, you know, Darren Wilson is a good example by the way. People should go see that Ferguson, the play, like it's getting all this attention. The Guy, yeah, there's this Guy Phil Mcaleer, he's like a friend of mine, he's an Irish guy, he's a journalist and he did verbatim theater of, um, of the Ferguson stuff where they just read the grand jury transcript and it's caused like all this controversy and craziness. It's here in la. And it's like totally not even political. They're just like reading this. But it's political because they're reading the script, you know what I mean? It's like one of those kinds of situations and it's really fascinating. Like I'd read the grand jury transcripts and everything, but to see like actual actors and human beings like talk about the, you know, what actually happened, like, and then obviously the actors are making choices and whatnot, like stress, certain words cause we just have a transcript. But it was like pretty riveting stuff of crazy.

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       But like if you look at like the Darren Wilson thing, it's like a perfect example of this. Like we don't really know what happened. Like what, we definitely know that that kid punched him. The kid's dead. Yeah. The kid punched him and the kid was shot at close range while I was trying to get the guy's gun. Yeah, we know. We know the autopsy all that's true. But like we don't know what was said. We don't know what they had for breakfast that well. You know what I mean? Like we don't know. No. And the thing is like we as humans, like Ben Gazi is another example. This, like all these events happen and people just go on like project their views, their experiences, their life, their whatever unto them. And did they come kind of like roar shock techs are like inkblots and we should be really like hesitant.

Speaker 3:          02:05:15       Like it's true that co that blacks are disproportionately killed by cops. It's also true that blacks disproportionately commit a lot of crime, right? Like if you, if you look at like the Asian stats, right? If you compare the Asian to the black stats in terms of crime, it's like night and day, right? Right. But you're also dealing with people that again grew up and are a sub. There are product of these environments and disproportionately black, disproportionately black in, in these crime ridden, horrific environment. I mean like if you have all these housing projects and the hell hole of like not having fathers around, I'm with you on all of this, right? But I think we need to be like, I think these, these communities are so intractable and the solutions that we've offered for many, many years of like they're not solving the problem. And I don't know that we can ever really solve them.

Speaker 3:          02:06:01       And that's kind of like, to me, that's the most terrifying thing about this is that it's just a permanent feature of modern life. Don't think there's enough effort put to try to solve the problem. And I think the, the clear root of that problem is, I described it yesterday in terms of if we are a super organism, we look at it and look at our, our, our country as a microcosm of the world super organism. What's the issue with this organism? Will, the issue is the organism has some six spots. It's not dealing with, the way I described it yesterday is if you have a staph infection and you're angry at the staph infection for not healing, sure. Right? I mean, it's like a fucking stupid staph infection. Why don't you pull yourself up by your bootstraps? I like, but if you look at like say like a staph infection, right?

Speaker 3:          02:06:42       Like if you're a super organism or whatever, we're all gonna die, right? Like at some point like we're going to get, you know, we're going to get inoperable brain cancer, whatever, something's going to happen to us. Like that's part of life. Like I think we undersell how much of life is just playing shitty and like we're always like, as like Americans, like we're always trying to like solve these problems. Right? But like, like sometimes things are just not solvable, right? Like sometimes, so this is certainly solvable. This is, you're more optimistic than I am. We're optimistic. But you're talking about like we've, you have a broken arm but he then we'll fuck it. I'm going to die anyway. Why go to the Donald? But I mean that's essentially what you're saying. No, no, not exactly though. I'm saying like there's certain things, let's take a cancer, right?

Speaker 3:          02:07:19       Inoperable cancer. Right. And we're a staff weren't, you know, there are citizen and nonporous but there are certain ghettos aren't inoperable. I mean how would you, how would, how would we solve that? We would go home my money and go, fuck, it should make an effort. How about some effort? There's almost being done. If you look at like Dorchester while I used to live, right. Um, and how shitty and rundown it was. You know, they're putting in all these new schools, they're putting in school choice things. It's charter school is all that. I'm all, some people get upset at that. I'm all right. Yeah. And then they get pissed off because they're real estate prices go up. Right. So it's like, and then, yeah, poor people have always gotten fucked throughout human history. Like it's just a shitty part of existence. You know, like, and I don't know, so many of the solutions we offered, we built housing projects to help people with affordable housing.

Speaker 3:          02:08:02       Right. Then they became like dens of crime, you know, like affordable housing. It just makes it cheaper for people to live in a fucked up place. It doesn't change the fucked up place. You have to figure out a way somehow or another, and I'm not a social engineer, but I think there has to be some sort of a way to look at these communities. And there's six spots. These are, these are areas where there's a disease and that disease is crime. And poverty and you have to figure out a way to make it better. And one of the ways to make it better, as you got to shine a light on it, you've got to pay attention to it and you got to put a lot of money into it. You gotta, you gotta put a lot of money into it in terms of trying to build up that community, trying to help those people.

Speaker 3:          02:08:43       But if you look at like the La public schools or you look at some of the public school systems up there, we pour shitloads of money into them. Yeah. Awful there. We get nothing for the money. See, to me, what's scary about this, like I talked to my family in Baltimore, like if, you know what's scary to me about this is that like what happens is that they get political leadership and it's not a Democrat Republican thing. People are trying to put it in that Lens. It's they get political leadership. I mean the mayor before this last one, like when to jail was indicted for corruption. They get these really corrupt, thuggish bad people. And I'm not saying that thuggish cause they're black, you know I'm saying they're thugs because they're thugs, right? They, they prey on their own people and they pray in their own communities and it's really like sick.

Speaker 3:          02:09:23       And I don't know how you solve that. If we're going to have, like, if we're going to have a society where people can vote and elect people, like, I mean, so much of the political system is bullshit. Even in like the wealthier parts of the country, right? We still have to deal with assholes who like pretend to represent us who are whatever party. And yet like these people have no choice. They're often like, you know, the people who get elected or like corrupt, they're bad people and yet like they're supposed to, I mean you can't get a good system out of a corrupt yeah. Group of people. You're just not going to happen. Right. I see what you're saying. And I think the, uh, you're ultimately correct and I think that, I mean, what do you do? Do you do, do you send in like the National Guard?

Speaker 3:          02:10:00       I'm like martial law. No cause it's a millet. There's gotta be some way to enhance the communities. There's gotta be some way to enhance the education is going to be some, there's gotta be some way. I'm not the guy you, no, no, no, no. My time, and I think this is something that needs to be looked at objectively over longterm. It's, it's gotta be a project where you, he's somehow or another half to revitalize and reenergize these areas and then deal with the fact that the momentum of the past is so goddamn strong in these places and they've been fucked for decade after decade after decade, generation after

Speaker 2:          02:10:33       generation, after generation of people born to this thing with very little

Speaker 4:          02:10:38       recourse. I think Obama's right. I mean, I don't agree with Obama and all that stuff, but I think Obama's right when he says that, you know, he quotes Faulkner saying that the past isn't pass. It's not, you know, at the past is not finished. It's not even past. Yeah, you're right. Like, I mean there is something to be said for this being a legacy of slavery. It's a legacy of like failed urban policies of the 60s. It's a legacy of like, we're always like kind of dependent on history. Like history is still very much alive. And some of these places, you know, well it's so recent as we're talking about slavery being 1865, that's just not that long ago and 50 years. It's nothing. It's a blip. Um, the University of Virginia Case, is there any repercussion against the girl who filed the fee? She's, she kind of dropped out of school.

Speaker 4:          02:11:23       I think she works at last I checked, she works at a hair salon and it's just sad. The whole thing is sad. Like it's a lot of people think I take like joy and having, I take joy and like exposing the truth always. But I don't take joy in like, you know, these people whose property was destroyed. This girl's life is ruined. I mean, to a certain extent, there's, that's like the social costs. Like I had to, I had a responsibility to like make it public who this person was. Um, I think, but um, it's sad. Like the whole situation is kind of sad and I know there's some people right now who want to do like a more comprehensive report and I'm probably going to help with that going into more stuff on Sabrina Reuben Eardley but they're, I mean their fraternities, their football teams, there's all this stuff that's under attack all throughout the country right now by the social justice warriors.

Speaker 4:          02:12:03       And um, it, it's going to be quite frightening. I think it's going to be, I think it's going to intensify before it gets, and it, what we have right now is we have a war and I, and I hate the word war because like, and I hate even the warriors thing of the social justice thing. I prefer like social justice activists because they're active there. It's not a war. Like we're not shooting each other like thank God. Right. But I think there really is like a political electronic civil war going on right now between people who have narrative based views of the universe and people who are fact based and and and their big, excuse me, they're basically at loggerheads and I don't know how long this can endure. You know like you talked about like slavery and the civil war. Like Lincoln said, a house divided against itself can't stand, I don't know how we have journalists on the one hand who present facts and figures and trying to like understand the world and then others who try and basically preach and sell like crazy narrative the world. I don't know how this coexists, wow.

Speaker 2:          02:13:01       I think it coexists in that they're there. This conflict and the debate and the discussion people like you or people, like many of the people that are listening to this now or watching this or people that are discussing this right now on Twitter and arguing pro and con [inaudible], these subjects get vetted out. They get discussed, they get debated, they get bound, you know, bounced back and forth. And some people will change their minds. And some people were will be reinforced by this conversation and some people be angered

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       by this conversation. Some people will anger that I have you on. Yeah. And I saw that it's kind of, what do you think is up with that? The, the rape, um, the outing people. I think people need to saying their names. I think that's a big, that's part of it. But I think I also think I've said some stuff, you know, I've said sums up where I've changed my mind on it and I'm also said stuff on Twitter. So I see Twitter as a way of sparking conversations. Like a lot of the stuff that I put on Twitter I don't necessarily always agree with and I'm not trying to be a troll like necessarily, right. I'm trying to like force conversations that I want to have that no one else has having, well you was the one you have like name the names of celebrities that are a support the Baltimore riots.

Speaker 4:          02:14:08       Yeah. Yeah. No. What I want to do with that is I want people to understand like, you know, there are people out there who there should be a consequence for like supporting it. Well, I'm not saying anybody support any fucking riot. There are people out there like Sally Code. I mean there are people out there who are saying them Saturday cone, I'm sure. I think she's on a MSNBC or she's on CNN or something. She says riots or, yeah. Oh yeah. There are people who are saying that the riots, the response to the riots are a political thing. It's an uprising. It's an insurrection. Same people who defended the Ferguson stuff is a uprising against the police. Against the system. Right. Don't you think though, in some ways the, the what the benefit of it is, is that we're all forced to discuss this now. We're all forced to look at the Sherry of Baltimore, this horrible area.

Speaker 4:          02:14:50       And my friend John Rollo lives in Baltimore and he said, fucking, he says there's parts of Baltimore that are just God damn crazy. And we're seeing it right now. I mean a lot of people were exposed to it from the wire and they weren't aware of the problem of the wires I tweeted the other day is that there are far too many white people on it. I mean that's what, that's what this is showing to us. I mean, yeah there's, there's some truth to that. But you know, and like if you're, my cousin likes to say if your, if your show, if your city is known for the wire and homicide and all this other stuff, it's probably not good. Well it's definitely a fucked up part of the country. It's, and there's many areas that are like it. Detroit is pretty, God damn fucked up. Tons of Philly Chicago out there.

Speaker 4:          02:15:29       There's some places that could blow and there's some places now because of youtube and all of these videos that everyone has a rather a phones that can take videos, you can expose all sorts of shit that shouldn't be happening. But police brutality and then there's a reaction to it. Do you know, like, so I've been thinking about this, I totally agree with you, but nature, the nature of like everyone has these, right, and how awesome that is, how powerful it is. Andrew Breitbart, others have talked about how awesome this technology is. But to a certain extent, when I turn on the camera, right, you're turning on the camera on me. You know, we've got this audio equipment people change, right? So like to a certain extent, when I'm, when you're running around filming stuff, some people are performing for the camera, no doubt. Right? That's escalates because of that. And I don't know what you do about that cause you can't, you can't on the one hand sensor it because if you censor it, like that's evil and wicked. Like we're against that. We have a first amendment for a reason we want to show. But on the other hand, like, you know, it's like the, the, what is it that, um, uh, Paredo a factor. There's an effect where basically you watching something causes people to change their behavior. If you watch your employees

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       are gonna change their behavior, well, it just is. I don't think there's, I mean it just is, it is a fact. No solving it. Yeah. It doesn't seem, it seems to be a new reality. Just like how do you get away from the fact that everyone has a cell phone, you, you don't, unless an asteroid hits and we have a massive cataclysmic disaster that shuts down the power grid and there's no more, no more monitoring or whatever, unless that had walking dead style because there's not really much you're going to be able to do this, this, this is our new reality. Just like the people that live before cars could never have imagined being able to drive across the country in four days, just like the people existed before. Planes can never imagine it doing it in six hours. You're just not going to change that unless you change the entire civilization.

Speaker 3:          02:17:14       This is going to have to happen for that. Something new. Yeah, totally agree. So I don't think we should necessarily concentrate on that as much as we should concentrate on what are the lessons that we can learn from all this and what I think ultimately we have to concentrate on these areas, whether they're Ferguson, which is a very high crime area, has been for a long time, or whether it's Baltimore, there's, there's areas of the country that need help. And the people that grow up in their grow up in these horrible crime ridden environment that really don't have any other recourse. They don't, or a lot of recourse I should say. Yeah. I don't know what to do about it. I mean, like one of the things that, one of the things that I kind of feel bad about this, you know, like everyone's going after this, you know, this woman Stephanie Rawlings Blake for saying, you know, we need a space to destroy.

Speaker 3:          02:17:58       I went after, I know a lot of people are going after, um, you need a space to destroy. Did you see this? So she did a video where she said, um, I actually, the video that we did have a good morning Baltimore, where with the riots we started with this opening thing where she said, you know, we need a safe space for people to destroy, for writers to destroy and people are going after. She said she misspoke. I don't know. I'd give her the benefit of the doubt cause she's been kind of like reluctant and bringing in the police to basically solve the riots. But basically I feel really bad for her because like this is a really tough job to be mayor. Like, you know, like I get to be a journalist, you know, we get to basically just like bloviate and bullshit about this, right?

Speaker 3:          02:18:36       Like we're not the ones like in these cities like making these decisions. Like I always try and put myself in the position of people, you know what I'm saying? Like I was trying to put myself in their chair and like, it's a shitty situation and I don't see any situation short of like bringing the military, which I, you know, I'm not a big fan of military industrial complex, but like that's what they're going to have to do. They said did the same thing with the La riots here, right? Like, um, you know, the Koreans were defending themselves and their rear property. Um, and they can't really do that in Maryland because they don't have concealed carry and they have a lot of guns, gun restrictions and people who are in the kind of white areas, they are kind of liberals then wouldn't have guns anyways. Um, but what I find really interesting about this and like is that how quick people are to judge our elected leaders and we should judge them. But like, it's a hard life. Like it's a shitty situation that these people are in and I guarantee you like Stephanie Rawlings Blake, you know, the mayor there, she never thought she'd have to deal with this

Speaker 4:          02:19:27       shit. You know, like it's tough thing. It's a tough gig. While we try to make sure that we're protected from the cars and other things that were going on. We also gave those who wished. What does that the space to destroy? Yeah. There's this face right there, Huh? Wow. The mayor is not saying that she asks people to give space to people who sought to create violence and he suggestion otherwise we are misinterpretation of her statement or statements sucks, which is not a good statement. What she's saying within the statement and it ended the video itself like be people should watch it. People should make up their own. I think what happens a lot of these situations is that the police, the the activist, there's like a view among the sort of like, you know, municipality run system. There's a view that like, hey, we can't bring, I can't bring the cops in cars.

Speaker 4:          02:20:16       If we bring the Compson, it'll just inflame people because like, you know, it's the same thing with the video camera. If you could put a cop and a ghetto environment, people hate the cops. Like they're going to react, right? Like, and so their view is like we shouldn't bring the police but then you don't bring in the police and then the riots get even more out of hand and it's like, it's like you can't win situation. I'm of the opinion that when we look at these I, these isolated instances, any of them we, we look at it and we say, okay,

Speaker 2:          02:20:41       wow this is horrible. The world is fucked. But I think that what's going on with all of these incidences is we're reacting to problems that we have in our society. We have, we're reacting to these, these areas that need attention and these explosive events that cause whether it's riots or protests or marches or all of these things are ultimately good because I think they cause people to focus on these areas that are convenient to ignore.

Speaker 4:          02:21:13       I told him, I mean I agree with you that he does spotlight this stuff. I had just not, I hope you're right. Like, I mean, like if I go pray that you're correct, that we can solve a lot of this stuff, but like we've been dealing, like not every society gets a do over, right? Like some societies are humble are fucked from the beginning. Yeah. Right. That it's just a question of it playing out, right? Like, you know, you could, we're also the first society that's had this kind of access to information ever. The history that we're, I mean if you're, if you're, there are two ways to bet, right? There's the pessimistic kind of like, Shit's going to go down, all that kind of thing. Which like, temperamentally, I'm probably more that way. Um, but you could be right. I'm not, I'm not, I don't dispute you like there's shit that we'd like, I mean, the fact that I have this effect that I have a career because of this exists, right? And the fact that I'm able to disrupt bad stuff on the Internet and cause things to change, it's all awesome. All good. Like I'm all for it. But I think there's a, the same technology that allows us to spotlight government abuses can often, uh, you know, in the wrong hands can be used to basically promote and do riots. I mean like, well,

Speaker 2:          02:22:15       there's not going to be immune. It's not ultimately the solution. But I think that if you look at the course of human history, there's no denying that this is the safest time to live ever. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       it's awesome. And it's also very difficult to deny that the United States is one of the most innovative governments, the most innovative countries ever. It's only been around a couple of hundred years and look at all the crazy shit that's happened here. I mean, this is the, this is awesome. This is so cool. The forefront of the world when it comes to culture. I mean, I feel like I, I feel like every day with all the new technology, everything, I mean, I grew up with the Internet. Like I remember waking up one day, fuck, there was Wikipedia like you, you know, like I remember like, I remember my first Google search. Like I grew up like basically with the Internet. My point was that I'm with you all to more itself. It's fucked as it is as fuck does. It's been, you know, it's just these people that grew up generation, generation after generation live and in poverty.

Speaker 1:          02:23:07       It's only been around a couple of hundred years total. This is a new situation, but a completely new country. Ultimately when you look at the, the, the history of the world. Yeah. And you look at like shit like crack babies, which we thought was going to be huge problem, turns out to not have been a bigger problem. Right? Like there's a lot of stuff, there's a lot of room for optimism and even things like social justice warriors are people that are going after college campus scenarios where they believe that there's men that are committing rape ultimately what they're doing, even if I disagree with their methodology or disagree with their ideology that they're pushing forth in favor of objective truth. Ultimately it's to try to stop crime, stop people from being victimized. It's a trend. That's a good trend. Yeah, totally. I mean, even if it's done in the wrong way, I mean, look, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

Speaker 1:          02:23:56       Right. By you, you son of a bitch. I'm not honestly, it's true. It is true. Nobody says like, Yo, I'm the villain. Right. Like nobody ever says there are a few guys, but they're pro wrestlers. Yeah, yeah. And, but they didn't. And they do it as a branding thing. Yeah. Listen, I gotta get out of here, but I really, I really enjoyed this conversation and I appreciate it. And for all the people that judged you coming in, I hope they gave you a shot and let you take the first song. I'm happy to come back anytime. Let's do it again. Do it again. Definitely. Thank you. And you can get ahold of him and send all your mean shit or nice things to chuck c Johnson, uh, on Twitter and got news.com is your website and a, I think you're very thoughtful person and thank you for having me. I appreciate it. It's nice to meet you in real life. Nice to meet you too. Thank you. All right. You fuck. See you soon. Bye. Bye. Big Kiss.
