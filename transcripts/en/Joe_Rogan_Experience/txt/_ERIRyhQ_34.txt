Speaker 1:          00:00:05       I was listening to some old timey music the other day and it was making me think of how depressing it would be if that was the only music that you could hear. La La La la La la La David Lynch movie that David Lynch in his movies, he always has those, those songs. Like there's a woman dead in a hotel and there's just this

Speaker 2:          00:00:24       oh

Speaker 1:          00:00:27       mansion. The days where that Tuba with a needle at the bottom of my grandfather had one of those in my home in Pelham. And his Colin Powell in New York, they had an old chronic graft. They, it is called right phonograph and they would play, uh, you know, classical. My grandparents never listened to. They were Sicilian. They never listened to music. Did your parents or your grandparents have the TV and a cabinet? Ah Ha. And they certainly did. And then with the TV would die. A lot of times folks who put the new TV on top of the cabinet, they would keep the tea, the cabinet with the blown out TV. Yeah, dude, everybody did that. Well, I had a family that never threw anything away. No my night. Never ever. I'm talking about road cones. We got to my attic, we find crazy. She had her phone.

Speaker 1:          00:01:11       Yes. Phonograph. Not a chronic, that's a chronograph, but they always had a chronograph. Oh, watch. Oh, right, right. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I have a chronology, goddammit. Yeah. Those things were crazy. Like that was how they used to listen to music. A Tuba attached to a needle bolts right here and the speaker must have sounded like dog shit. My Dad used to have a dust cover for his turntable and he would, he had, there was a ritual to how you clean your Lp. Oh, there's a ritual. You got to dust it off. You have a special cloth and all the shit thing. Yup. That's what we take a peek at that fucker. Look at that. That's nuts. I think for people at home, it looks like it does a really traffic cone. Right? It does. Right. Like a big old brass traffic. A little needles. I read the Ted Williams, the great, uh, this might've been a myth, but the great baseball player, Ted Williams, who could hit a fast ball, hit any kind of ball, and he apparently could read the label of a record as it was going around.

Speaker 1:          00:02:11       His eyes could slow shit down. Holy Shit. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder if that's true. I wonder. Well, yeah, you know, is this is one of those three things you hear, right? Like Joe Frazier was in a hotel room. There were four flies in the room there, the way it was started with the flies and he went and caught them all and he goes, here, you flies the fuck out outta here. Andy Griffin was telling us that Bruce Lee's story once it was one of those, yeah, I heard he killed him. Bruce Lee was in a fight with 30 men and he stood in the center of all of them. And you're like, wait, wait, wait, wait. Where'd you hear this? He never, I heard he never wasn't harangue already. He would never, he never sparred once. I don't think Bruce Lee ever. Did you ever fight competitive? Was rumored. No, but he did one thing once where you sparred at like this a karate festival. One sparring session. Cool. Yeah. All right. Well

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       good luck. Yeah. You could see good luck against the guys to be able to read the label on the no. Good luck to everybody against a guy like Darren till that's luck. Good luck. I mean, yeah. Vinny, vinny shoreman who is, he does, um, a color commentary for a lot of big Moitai events. Yeah. And super knowledgeable like as a striker and he's also a hypnotist. I got hypnotized by them a couple of times. I, I kept my pants on, but he got, sorry. Yeah, you hypnotize me. Fascinating. V Hypnotism is feet. You get hypnotized cause you're 100% really? Yeah. Give into it. Yeah. Just let it, let, let yourself achieve the state. But you realize what it is. It's like, Oh, you've got this idea where like someone can like turn you into Manchurian candidate if they hypnotize you and you wouldn't have to troll your brain anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:03:43       No, no, no, no. You're relaxing. Yeah. You're relaxing and you're open to suggestion in an interesting state of mind that you can achieve. Right? See like I think just think there's a larger spectrum of the way the mind works then we give it credit for. And I think what I've been thinking about this a lot that that's one of the things that happens with standup. I think if you're onstage and you're killing and stand up, if I'm in the audience, it's like you've got me hypnotized. I'm locked up into your line of thinking and like your act is a very silly, so like when I'm watching you, like I start thinking in silly ways and then you'll keep getting sillier and sillier and then like I'm locked into your head. It's like it's a form of hypnosis, 100% and I think that so is like being in a good place.

Speaker 3:          00:04:29       Thank you. Young. Jamie said though. So it'd be in a good place mentally. So it was being in a bad place. But I think there's like, there's a large spectrum in the mind of all these different chairs. Where are you going fucker? He can't. What kind of staggered was fantastic. Cheers dude. It's all right. It's a solid white on the juice guys, gentlemen. I like them because it's a good juice. It's a good juice and those guys are gross. Hey you guys who say it's a good juice and you're talking about wine. It's a sexy juice stopped. Honestly, it's sexy. Just kind of feels like talk to you. It's like taking a big bite. On one hand it's like having a wet dog to great juice shake itself out. You have, have you ever gone into like a real wine tasting with a bunch of nerds?

Speaker 3:          00:05:10       Sure. Have different cause. Amazing. Those nerves. Nerves I ever got to a wine taste tasting where you graded a wine and you stood up and said it has woody after tones and there's a s I was invited, I was invited by a guy a long time ago, 20 years ago. And he said, um, I'm going to invite you to a wine tasting where we all bring our own wines. And he said, he's a good guy. Goes, he said, I said, well, what do I bring? And he said, I don't want to insult you, but you can't afford the kind of wines that we're bringing, so I'm going to bring you a bottle from my seller so it doesn't make you look. That's how, that's how big these wines were. And I was there with the guy from like Zach, he's or whatever the different southerby's they did the guys that set the standard and write the thing and I was watching him taste it and write down notes. It was really wild. Nutmeg to leather, mushrooms,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       earth, you know, all kinds of weird tasting those. It's still subject. My buddy matt is a huge wine head. Like he's got his own cellar in his house. It's all temperature controlled. And if I'm out at a restaurant, I'll call Matt [inaudible], Matt Lichtenberg. I'll call him up and I'll, I'll, I'll go, hey, okay, let me tell you what I got. Yeah, tell me what to get. And he'll just like, oh, the reason why this is this one socks and stay away from this one and this is, this is what you want. That's your groove right there. Grab that one. And I'm like, okay, well he's always right. Yeah. The brand has been known as a new wine. Kai Kai has a ridiculous, a good one. I've had that at 97. Ron is a wine head. Yeah. Yeah. He has some up quite a few bottles of opus one apparently.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       Which is this one is not, that's as it guys. Way better than opus one. Look at what you wrote here last night was mad real fresh out of advil. Jesus. Grab the wheel. Sheesh. Vegan fucked up a Lebron James. I think I brought that wine to the one with the yellow. Uh, I think you did. I think I brought that here. I think you did. Yeah, it looks very familiar. Yeah. That's some good ass fucking wine. Schatz home old cliche. Good ass. Why Mr. Super Athlete and there you go. That's a real one. Why? There's some real super athletes. We go, listen, he's an Avatar. Fuck what kind of steroids you take. Never going to look like that. Never. Never. Like there's, there's human beings that have just the most unfathomable physical advantages. It's ridiculous. Like Lebron James would have like an unfathomable physical advantage over someone who had have an unfathomable physical advantage over you.

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       Yeah. Well I think I asked the guy who follows this, Jimmy Burke about Lebron James and called them up and I just, I left. I left him one message. I go, I said, Jim, and I want you to be honest and don't insult me. At what age did Lebron James Surpass me as an athlete and be careful with your fucking answer. He said, because I'm a proud man that man and I'll kick your fucking ass. I hung up the phone, I got a very thoughtful, very thoughtful, this station and I just got this 12 years old and there's no question about that 12 by the time he was 14 six four two 35 best player in the country. You were not that. You're not even close to that. He was 14 and he was six four, yeah, he's a freak and there you go. Oh six, nine two 65.

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       And I sat next to Carlos Boozer who played with him and they're the same size. And he goes, he's just a step faster. And everybody as well as as and just ridiculously strong. We'll see a guy like that. If he was fighting, everybody would be fucked. Of course the, they're lucky. They are God damn lucky. There's that much money at basketball. Right? He's incredible. And then people go, well, you know what man, some things that make great looking at basketball player wouldn't necessarily make you a great fighter. Um, listen, listen to me. Save it. That guy's going to beat your fucking ass. This he's a winner. There's, there's just a certain

Speaker 4:          00:08:55       level of winners. They like, he do whatever the fuck you want. Bo Jackson could have done ever. I worked with Bo Jackson for a week. Did you? Yes, I did. And he was, um, and I said, oh, what do you, what do you weigh? He was in a white t shirt and I was looking at the thickness of his fingers. You know me, I have sas because I'm basically a gay man. So I was, I was looking at his hands, I grabbed his hands. It was just this giant me and I said, what do you, he goes, um, he said, I remember in her, he was so weird. It's so specific. He said, I'm 61 and a half, 240 pounds to 245 pounds. And he was the same size when he played and he never has lifted weights in his life ever. And he didn't lift weights. When he play, he would just, as in his words, I just strap it on and I'd hear the other team go on posing the game, posing in the game.

Speaker 4:          00:09:42       But you have to also understand at Bo Jackson, not only did whatever you want it to you on the football field faster and everybody at two 45 and stronger. He was also a, was he, was he not an MVP in baseball star? At least start that. That's unheard of. Deion sanders play both ways, but there's no one like Bo Jackson free. That's crazy. Throwing Bibi's, throwing fucking ropes from center field. I mean he, the whole different, a whole different kinds of one tackle one hip injury that's changed all that shit. Well it was his hip started to die or have some kind of in a crisis in this bone or something. Let's from getting hit, there was a very famous hit that he got tackled. You could see like the impact that has on his hips when he goes down. At least I am I remembering that correctly.

Speaker 4:          00:10:22       There was a video, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can see the injury and it's just a ridiculous half. And we still came back and was smashing home runs with a fake hip, came back and played baseball. Just couldn't really run anymore, you know, just a different kind of, just a different kind of wonder if they could fix that hip. Now you know, you think about what his hip was then and what does hip is now? Well, I think you'd have to read, you have to generate their tissue. So I don't know if we're there yet, but we're getting close. What I mean is like the artificial hips. I wonder if there, those are better now. I don't know it did you read a book called Sapiens? I sent you a, probably not, but Yuval Harari. Everybody should read it. It's an amazing book and it's a brief history of mankind, but it brings us to present day and he also wrote another book called Homo Deus, I think.

Speaker 4:          00:11:02       When should you send this to me? I sent you a screenshot. I said, you've got to read this book, but Oh, but he, he talks about where we're headed technologically. He's really done the research. I mean really looking honestly at what medical research, what to expect in the next 30 years. You say, well, I mean, you know, not only are we going to live much longer if you have the money, but the real question he ends the book with in a way is we have to decide as human beings, for the first time in our history, we can control our own evolution. So we have to ask ourselves what we want to become. That's a really big responsibility. What do you want to become? What do we want to become? Because that question can be answered. We will have the technology to answer that question and, and it can get silly where you can say, we could splice our genes with Elian or with a gorilla. But, but

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       more importantly, we'll be able to splice our genes with synthetic biology and become what it, but it's a very heavy question. What do you if so if you want to live forever, if you become what he called, I think it was a moral, uh, or a different word for it. But we're going to get mad at you for fucking 50 year olds. Like they don't know anything yet. God, how could you fuck a 50 year old? You'd be like a thousand years old. I know you'll, you'll be so smart. And so, so why is people go, you know how gross you are. You're fucking someone who's 50 years old as a human. We figured, look, we only think of ourselves as like, Oh, you should have your shit together by 50 because we know we only lived to be a hundred. But the reality is most people don't get their shit together.

Speaker 3:          00:12:32       Period. Yeah. Like that. It's a race that nobody's winning. Yes, but we all know that if we just, if we had an infinite amount of time, we would keep getting better at getting our shit together. You would not be who you were yesterday and hopefully you'd be much better than you were a year ago. But I think about something different. Like I, that's the case though. But if you get to 900 years old, are you still allowed to bang 50 year olds? Like live? Like if she's a fucking kid, bro. I mean when is it? Okay. I mean if she's super hot and vampires, vampires, fuck like 30 year olds, but we're talking about people, Bro. I'll talking about like, you're apparently not if you can live, if they figure out medical science and this is not outside the realm of possibility, they can regenerate tissue and you stem cells to rejuvenate your body and you live 900 fucking years old.

Speaker 3:          00:13:14       Are you allowed to bank 50 year olds or are you gross? Well, it takes to actually have what I think the answer is, it takes time and it, and it flips it on its head. I mean time no longer has a consequence because there's not, you have very, you don't really have limitations. We had the biggest thing about human beings, right, is that we have limitation. We know we're going to die. That's the fundamental difference between sort of a, the idea of a a robot being just like a human, we are defined by our limitations. Right. But you know why they bring the, the draft around and try to get young people to get drafted. I didn't want to go out to their 40 year olds and 50 year olds would think cause it won't work like a wonder if it gets to a certain age.

Speaker 3:          00:13:52       I wonder if you live to a certain age and like cults just don't work anymore. I wonder if it only works up until you're like 50 or 60 or 70 but if people live forever it would be just like telling Santa Claus to like a little kid. Like it tell Santa Claus to your five year olds. They're like Whoa, Santa Claus is real. Yeah. He tells the Santa Claus to a 15 year old. They're like, what the fuck are you talking about? The same kid, it'd be like, Dad, you're retarded. Like stop. This is the sense that it depends on how, how, whether you or not, you've brought your understanding. There are a lot of old coal, but if you're a cult leader and you're 900 years old and you just bang and all these 50 year old ladies, you're an asshole. They're like little kids still. Maybe, maybe, well, 50 year olds are not gonna look like 50 year olds. Now they're going to look. It got really hot. But my point is like there was still beating me naive. They still put the holy water on themselves. They still do. You know there's going to be awake, weird shit, but there'll be attracted to that 900 year old cars full of wisdom possibility. A sorcerer. Yeah. It was kind of power you to have your nine years old. As you get older, that of life breaks

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       down. You're out when you're younger and you'd see somebody who's really good at something, you're like, God, they're a genius. And then you kind of get, you start, you know, you get to a certain days where you get good at something or you just start to do it enough and you go, there's a certain formula to success. Like sometimes like it to be really good at something. There's a, there's a, there's a, there's a mindset for competition. But to be really good at something also just requires a shitload of repetition and good toodle edge. There's a lot of touching, a lot of focus. And one of the things that you recognize in people when you, you see another enough people that are like really truly awesome at something, you see enough of them, you start to recognize this like thing. Like, I especially can see it in musicians because I have zero talent cause I have zero musical talent whatsoever. Zero. Have you ever tried to actually hold a tune? You're trying to just try this, try to sing all serious. Don't laugh. No. Try to sync. Just look at me. It's embarrassing, but do it. Okay. Try to sing. I want to sing silent night. Holy night. Try to hit it. Don't do it right and then I'm going to try it. It's so hard.

Speaker 1:          00:15:53       So nervous. It's so vulnerable. I'm asking this in two verses, but isn't it funny that like making noises with your mouth? It's vulnerable.

Speaker 5:          00:16:04       Nah.

Speaker 2:          00:16:06       Oh,

Speaker 5:          00:16:08       lean.

Speaker 1:          00:16:09       That's not bad. Oh, this copy. That was spring. Can you get a little power? Oh, is Bra. Ciao. What's the rest of, I don't know. Something in heavenly peas. Holy infant. So tender and mild. Oh, so already please then leave

Speaker 6:          00:16:49       pe.

Speaker 1:          00:16:51       I went immediately to the douche singer voice that whispery. I know you did, but you, but you know what you had to do. I think you were. He was tuned was me. Jamie entering key. Don't you tell her anybody who talks to you like that? Listen to me ladies. That's my joke about, that's my joke. Where I do I, I talk about that guy. You can say nice dressed. Just don't whisper it. That's where it's creeping. That's funny. That's what am, I was like, there's just some things you can't whisper in life. Like you can be like, your daughter is so cute. If you're like, your daughter is so cute. It's creepy. The creepy voice is recognized, but you know, you know what? It's a fucking confusing ass voice is the scary voice. You know the scary voice like next on twilight zone, like anybody taught like any scary monster like and then they went down that dark dark row. Yeah, like are those people who have that kind of a scary voice this summer? And here's

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       another one that doesn't work. Hell just got a hot is girls all the hottest dancing like that. Kind of like hot and sexy. There's old commercials, remember and I would just like a weird rhythm to the way they're talking. They're establishing very clear parameters for vocabulary. Oh, the hottest girls. There's not going to be some soliloquy fees on your interpretation of consciousness as you know it versus this objective view of the universe now. Now it's, Oh, the hobby, all that. It's dancing. It's like you have these like really short sentences. Well, so we're, we're, we're in tune, we're in tune with those rhythms. Those girls are saying, look, to cut the bullshit. We're down to fuck. We've got fake tits and we're drunk. That's what they're saying with that voice. Like that's what that voice is. Did you ever, did you ever hear the experiment they did where they played?

Speaker 4:          00:18:36       Um, doctors? So they took, they took different doctors and some had been sued a lot and then they just took the doctors at bedside. They recorded them speaking and they took out the words so you could only hear the tone of their voice. And people said, I don't like that guy. And they didn't even know what they were saying. They say, I don't like that guy. And without, almost like most of them chose the doctors that had been sued. And it turned out that they had a dominant tone so that their tone and the sound of their voice was what people objected to. And because their bedside manner was a saddle, Malcolm Gladwell's book, their bedside manner was, was dominant. They weren't, they weren't sort of understanding and listening. They were rather telling the patient something. Those were the doctors regardless of their, their errors and what they did, um, that had nothing to do with their degrees.

Speaker 4:          00:19:32       Didn't even have do with it what they did. Um, those were the ones that got sued for malpractice. Don't remember. That's from blink, right? Yes. I think it's from blank blinks are great book. Yeah, it is. It's great. And it's a great audio book too. I got that one on audio book. I listened to it on audio. It's a very, I always listen to shit on audio. I listened to Sapiens on audio. It's very good drive. Yeah, it's very good way to uh, you know, I like podcasts but I like to mix it up and it's like, I don't want to only watch documentaries. I like watching fiction too. Oh, work watching. I like, I like to mix things up with, with would I take in and what have you. But I think that like audio books in particular, it's a great way to utilize like wasted time.

Speaker 4:          00:20:11       Yeah. 100%. 100%. Instead of listening to music. I always listened to, I listen to a whole course on Nietzsche would, how crazy was that story and blink about the artwork where they found this good statue and this art expert looked at it for a second and went, it's fake. How much would you be or what came to his mind back? Remember the word that came to what he says? Nay. He knew it was fake because new, nope, close when it was supposed to be up. Statute was buried for 3000 years. A Kudos, right? Like a fully formed Kudos is young boy in Greek, so it's a fully formed like statute, which is near a thessaloniki or something. And they tested the, the marble

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       came from Macquarie near there. They even tested the mold, which actually turned out to be somebody put it on potatoes, but they, but the mold seemed legit and all that stuff and, but he, the minute he saw it, he said, can you get your money back? This is a fake. And he didn't know why, but the first word that came to mind was fresh, fresh, kind of crazy, right? Yeah. Mason something you're supposed to here, but isn't it crazy? And he was right. Yeah. Then you could just see like for you and I would be like, wow, crazy statue. You know what I mean? We wouldn't have, but there's certain things that I'm sure you could see. You know, like there's certain things like here's one that I see all the time. Um, I see when people are about to spin from all my years of taekwondo.

Speaker 3:          00:21:26       Oh yeah. Like a little simple dip that people go, I was getting, he's looking at her. Did you call that a lot? All the time. Because you see, once you learn it when you're a little kid, cause he'd been kicked in the head a few times, like it becomes a part of your life. How does recognition see this little thing always kind of spin he's trying to spend, you know, and you see it. And as a regular person, I was like, how the fuck are you seeing that? Well, I've seen it cause people would hit me. Yeah, don't get hit by that. Yeah. Like when you see that, like, oh, get out of there. Yeah. Well one of the wealthiest guys, my friend who made $1 billion more, his buddy is worth some crazy amount of money. And uh, so what's your secret? And he said, uh, mirrors and windows.

Speaker 3:          00:22:01       So what do you mean? He said, I can tell if somebody is going to pay me back. I can tell if somebody is a good investment or not. And he said, well how? And he goes, you had to got windows, you've got mirrors for eyes and if you got married, surprise, you can go fuck yourself. You've got windows. I'm a lending money and that's an instinct he would just pick up on. He got [inaudible] Saturday and he could pick up on whether or not you were a phone. You know that's a real problem with communicating with people in nonverbal ways in non purse non-face-to-face ways. Yeah, it's a real problem with like texting and stuff like that. You're not looking into the person. Like I think it changes the way we talk to each other. It changes interactions. And I think most of the problem that people have most of the time with each other, there's not talking like today and especially not talking enough, looking at each other in the eyes.

Speaker 3:          00:22:43       That's exactly figuring out like if maybe someone's, someone's right, maybe you're wrong about something. You got to talk to them and you go, okay, well when did you think I was supposed to do? And I did that. Okay. Okay. And what time were you supposed to be there? What time did we say? I thought we said this and you can try to figure it out while you're looking at each other. Right. You know when someone gets say, look man, I was really bummed out. You know it was a really important thing. He was supposed to pick me up and then you could work it out and look at each other and work with that. But when you go through these series of text messages, I've had text messaged discussions with people are like, hey man, I can't do this. Like let's just talk. Can we just talk, cause this is crazy cause I don't know what your face is making when you're making the statement, you're saying something and it's not entirely accurate and I'm trying to figure out what the fuck your face looks like. We are you laughing? Is this lol right. We look at each other cause I bet we could work this shit out. You know that that's, that is the problem with reading sometimes about something and thinking you're getting the whole picture. What I like about Thaddeus Russell is that he, his book or renegade history of the United States, I think it's called, he actually takes a look at

Speaker 4:          00:23:45       things that I've never heard. I was a history major and historians tend to be pretty conservative, stodgy people, right? They, they're not, you know, but your average college professor is a pretty conservative guy. Even though he might be very left wing, they're conservative people. They're, they're not, they're not young. I'm not going to find them at an orgy or you know, usually or various things. And especially with historians and when they write history, they always write it from this really stodgy kind of, you hear about the events, you actually don't hear about what it was like in the brothels. You don't hear about what it smelled like in the bars. You don't hear about the noise. You don't hear about things that actually have an effect on people. Who are the criminals, how safe are the streets? Where were the prostitutes who was actually getting laid?

Speaker 4:          00:24:30       Was there a lot of black and white sex that went on in during the revolutionary where, which apparently there was a, what about dancing on a dirty white ladies? It got some dark Dick. I only, I can only hope I co it's the ultimate fuck you to your dad. Yes it is. Yes it is. How many chicks just fucking couldn't wait. I know as soon as it was, the veil was lifted, you know, as they say, my dad is fighting to keep you asleep. I'm fine to suck your Dick Dave. It sounds like a title little hot dirty white girl with freckles. Apparently there was a lot of that because what they would do is the Irish who come in, they were indentured servants. Then you have this black slaves and they danced. They would go, there'd be like these, these speakeasies and everybody would mingle.

Speaker 4:          00:25:18       It'd be late at night, black but beautiful black women and you know, the black and white dudes be like, dude, these girls are hot. You know, and there was mixing and everything else and there was all kinds of shit like that. Remember slavery was being talked about is I'm great moral evil. Really back when this country was founded, what really kind of, one of the things they say that kept slavery going another hundred years was the cotton gin, was the fact that Eli Whitney invented a machine that made it fucking really, really easy to separate the seed from the cotton. And as a result, this guy comes up with a great invention and it's rough. They were like, Whoa, we got all this free labor down here. I'm not free and slaves. This shit is white gold. I can send it over, I can send it to Europe, and there's an insatiable demand for my cotton fuck that I'm not going to have.

Speaker 4:          00:26:01       My whole economy is built on the fact that I've got all this free labor and I'm making a fortune. So a lot of historians kind of talk about how Eli Whitney invented a machine that was really efficient but might've been responsible for keeping an entire group of people in slavery for. That is so crazy to think about. Well, you came up with an idea. He came up with a cotton gin, most of the clothes that were made out of hemp, hemp fiber for everything, and apparently it's way better than cotton. It's stronger for sure. I stronger todd mccormick. Do remember my friend Tom Mccormick, he had this stock of hemp in his house and it was like from a hemp tree and it's like, it's from another planet. It doesn't seem like it's a real thing, so really

Speaker 7:          00:26:44       hard, but it's really light. It's light like, like Balsa wood, but it's hard. Like, oh cool. Like it's weird. It's cool. And he was explaining to me, and he knows way more about me than I do, but he was like, dude, it's an alien planet and it's an error on the alien planet. It's very hearty. We'd write an alien plant. It's like no other plant. It has all the essential amino acids. You, you get essential oils from it. It has protein in it, a very high protein content. Like you can eat hemp seeds are great for you, Huh? They're really healthy and you can make clothing out of it. You can make fuel out of it. Hemp fuel. Henry Ford made the first fenders on the first model t out of Ham. Fiber's really an, there's a video of him hitting them with a hammer and the hammer bounces off.

Speaker 7:          00:27:30       These hemp vendors, they're far more durable than steel. That's crazy. It's an insane fiber man. It doesn't make any sense. It literally is like no other fiber on the planet. It's a really complex fiber and it's illegal and it's illegal. You can go home, can't you grow hemp. You just can't grow the female plant and the government is doing their best to make cbds being regulated by the FDA. They're all trying to stop CB. There's people that are trying to stop cbd. It doesn't even have a psychoactive effect on you. Well, the guy who invented that, I mean, I don't know if he had vetted the dark web, but the the Silk Road Guy. Oh, brexit. Yeah. I got to point this out. This is really important though. Before I forget, the CBD oil folks, there's a, I'm reading a lot of reports online of people testing cbd and it tests positive for thc.

Speaker 7:          00:28:16       Greg Fitzsimmons talked about this. He said that he tried cbd oil and he got him high. I don't know what he used, which company he used, but the, the, the studies that I've read where people have actually got them tested, there's, there's thc in some of them, so you've gotta be careful, especially if you have some ups job or somewhere that, I don't know if ups tests where they test your piss. If you, if you take cbd oil for pain and inflammation, you've got to really make sure you trust the sources because I guess apparently it can, it can have thc in it. When you didn't you point that out.

Speaker 3:          00:28:48       I don't know if I did, but I've seen that same thing for two weeks. I think you're the one who told me about it first. Yeah. It's not just cause we were talking about Greg, like Greg, it's high off CBD oil. Mike. Like maybe it's just like a super lightweight, but I don't think so. Maybe. I think there's some weed and some of them I think might just be super sensitive. I love the weed. Yeah. I think if you just give him a regular cbd oil, Betty be fine. It might not even just be the CBD oil. I have noticed a something like head shops and some states that it's not recreationally available. They're selling it in the same form as like dabs and concentrates and you smoke the CBD the same way you would smoke that heavy concentrated shit. Whoa. And that crazy like dab rig with a hot torch.

Speaker 3:          00:29:29       So you smoke cbd oil that doesn't get you high and the Dab rig and that, I don't know what it is to sleep better. It didn't work. It didn't. I'll tell you what works. Smoking weed, you a a hard time sleeping. Yeah. What? Uh, anymore so much. But you know, I always worry, yeah, that'll do it. Yeah. Yeah. I worry that I, you know, he's just go, it's interesting sometimes it just, I feel guilty about being so lucky. I get into my really soft bed and I do what I love and I'm like, what does the other foot gonna drop here? If you really stop and think about how lucky you are in comparison to the vast majority of human doings are, it's ridiculous. What you know. Well, I'm what? You know, it's, I have zero tolerance for people that talk about how hard things are today.

Speaker 3:          00:30:17       Like they're complicated today. Yeah. They're not hard. It's complicated. Yeah. Way More complicated. Of course there are hard moments. No one's, no one's denying your, your pain and your hard moments. If you get a cut on your hand, you're not going to get gang green. Yeah. It's just way easier. A little thing. You don't have to worry about the, the pox. There's so much more today. It's a, this is a fucking crazy time and there's, it's still, the thing about this time is, the good thing about it is, yeah, we're overpopulated. Yeah. We're crazy. Yeah. This is the system we were operating on. Doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but you could still go into the woods at any moment. Like there's a place where you can go right now, we can go in the woods. Like you could go, you can go to big bear and you just go for a hike.

Speaker 3:          00:30:58       Also in you're in the forest like, oh, this shit's still real. It's still, this is still here too. Right. You know? Yay. Yeah, life is crazy and life's bizarre, but we haven't completely turned the whole world into a city. That's true. Guess what bitch that's coming. We looked out big Los Angeles is, it's much of it is covered in concrete and streets and then the streets go off everywhere, like veins and, oh by the way, 200 years ago, no streets aren't there, but are in town. We'll admins is expanding in this country. Is that wrong? I do not think that wildernesses are expand. There's more grazing land and stuff. I, I don't know. I mean we're definitely suffering from urban sprawl, but I was surprised to see how little, like the percentage of of the continental United States has actually inhabited that actually has houses and on, it was really small.

Speaker 3:          00:31:44       It surprised me that she had added me. Yeah, it's pretty small. Super. It's crazy how 6% or something. Yeah, and these little areas, but yeah, I'm like these people that live in these small towns all across the country does a big reason. Also why trump won. They just felt totally unrepresented by all the people that live on the sides. I also think it's because they had, I think 50% of Americans have what, $500 in their bank account? Something crazy. Yeah. She might be less than that. $400 it's $400 think about that. So that's why I get mad when people character. I don't like trump, but I never liked when people characterized all trump supporters as racist, et Cetera. I thought it was unfair because I think the majority of people want to live in some dignity, and they had Obama, eight years of Obama say, but you will. But their lives didn't change for a lot of reasons. I don't think Obama's to blame. There's a lot of reasons. And then along comes hilary's speaking the same exact language. So if you're going to blame people for saying, wait, under eight years, I still

Speaker 7:          00:32:40       only have $400 in my pocket. Here comes a woman who's speaking the same language. Oh, and by the way, there's a lot of rumors about being or being corrupt. I have nothing to lose. I'm going to try that other guy. Did you see what Donna Brazil rope? One of the reasons why she came out with their book is after seth rich got murdered and she called him a patriot. Wow. I didn't have seth rich got, oh, that, that's right. That was the guy worked for the DNC. There was a Bernie Sanders supporter that wikileaks has alluded to the fact that he them information and got shot in front of his house and it became this big conspiracy theory where people would mock you for saying it was a conspiracy and then hannity ran with it and so it became clearly there for a lot of people that seth rich conspiracy theory that it was nonsense.

Speaker 7:          00:33:19       Nobody knows what happened to that guy though he was murdered, his watch on his phone with him. He had his wallet on him. Nobody took anything from, they shot him at four o'clock in the morning. Who knows what happened. But when wikileaks starts saying that you gave them information and that there's consequences, do you give them information? One of two things is happening. Either wikileaks has decided, all of a sudden you start lying right and making things up about people or two, they were misinformed and someone was pretending to be this guy and sending them information. It's always possible if they can meet face to face or three, they're telling you something you didn't know that this guy who was just shot and murdered was leaking information about the DNC and other DNC was corrupted by the Hillary Clinton group, which is what Donna Brazil is saying in her book and that this guy released that and showed how the primaries were rigged against Bernie Sanders and that Hillary Ari was sending me excerpts from it the other day.

Speaker 7:          00:34:15       He's like, dude, she was Donna. Brazil was saying that Hillary was in control at DNC before the primaries, so, so is the implication that Hillary might have had something to do with his murder. That's the implication. The information was already out. I like maybe add more and maybe they were punishing him to stop other people from doing the same thing. Maybe other people had more information, you know, I don't know if it's true, but there was another guy that disappeared reasonably. It was a guy who, uh, had dirt on the Clintons. Some, some guy vanished. This is like really, really recent. Like, see if you could find that one. Some guy just read, just type in Google Clinton dirt. And this is like from Newsweek. So there's, people have vanished and I dunno how many of them had been murdered. People suicide themselves. I don't know how many of them actually suicide themselves, but it could, let's just say one out of 10, just one out of 10. It was an actual murder, right? This guy academic at the heart of Clinton dirt campaign vanishes. What leaving trail of questions. It's really recently. See that figured out when you kill people. It's my piece way hearts to maybe usually heal people. Um, it's like God damn, how does body get here? But when people just vanish, tamp, they just vanish. Oof. That's crazy. They just disappeared. What does that do when I need him? Whereas Mr Bravo and I made him crazy. He be going crazy about that one. Yeah, but Eddie's, Eddie's

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       conspiracies turn in on themselves because he'd be like, he's disappeared, but he's not really. What if he's not really dead? Eddie? Um, he loves himself a conspiracy. He gets so excited. Yeah, I know. It's like watching the clock in the community towards like a dude is super into sports. You know? Like he'll, he fucking, you want to talk to me about you? All I'm saying is it's a little weird. Well, you know what I tried to see someone was like, well, why does he enjoy conspiracies? I said, well, first of all, enjoy them. Enjoy what you like. But also Eddie's always been really good at like shutting down people not believing in his ideas with Jujitsu is Eddie has like revolutionary Jujitsu. Jujitsu is rubber guard setups and all the different things. The paths that he, he fixed a lot of paths in traditional Jujitsu, changed a lot of things and did some things his way.

Speaker 3:          00:36:33       And when he would describe it to me, I was like, oh, this is a guy like has an idea how to do things and when people are opposing. And he's like, no, no, no, no. I'm going to shut that down and move over here. So That's interesting. So it's brainworks hour. So when someone comes at him with an idea, he has an idea and he's going to try to get that idea through. And when you come at him with some weak attacks on that idea and just expect that he's going to relinquish his hold on the idea, he's like, no, no, no bitch. This don't make no sense. No, you don't. You don't have any information. It's going to take someone giving him real honest to goodness, impossible to deny information that he's going to believe in any of the conspiracies that he believes in war being false.

Speaker 3:          00:37:11       Or it's going to take somebody to explain him that his feelings control his thinking. That is true. But there have been conspiracies that have successfully been executed, which makes this whole thing way more confusing. It's like, which one of these were real to say that all conspiracies are bullshit. You are a victim of like some reverse racism. Yeah, no, no, I, I'm usually skeptical of conspiracies, especially government conspiracies because government has no tourists so completely out of sync and not efficient enough and certainly there are so many different competing interests within government. Within an administration. Yeah. Everybody's trying to undermine each other and that's the history and it was set up that way and even if you talk about faking the moonlight, you'd have to have about a thousand, maybe 2000 people to keep a secret. That's not necessarily the case. If you just had people thinking on a need to know bates basis with everything compartmentalized, like this guy's responsible for making the o rings.

Speaker 3:          00:38:12       This guy's responsible for, I don't know how it works. I've known, I don't know how it works either, but I do know that you're talking about if you were trying to fake the moon landing, one of the things that would be much easier is your d during the Nixon administration there were getting used to fake and things. Watergate was going on, you know, found out though, you know, cause somebody drops. You just starting to develop the kind of special effects abilities where you can sort of recreate spacings like 2001 that was the big conspiracy theorist dream. Was that somehow or another like there'd be like some irrefutable proof that Stanley Kubrick was the one who worked in the moon landing. That was like, if I'd found that I'd be like common in my pants. Like Eddie never acknowledges that the same impulse that drives him, which is really to find the truth and to be skeptical of of people's claims and even evidence that's been written down.

Speaker 3:          00:39:01       Human beings have always, always, for the most part, unless there's something wrong with you want it to be in the know. I don't know anyone who doesn't want to know the truth. I don't know anybody who doesn't want to know, who likes being deceived and so, so it it, that's why it's almost impossible to keep a secret longterm in government because somebody's always talking on the other side of it. Here's one of the reasons why the whole conspiracy thing is so attractive to people because there's a reward chain built into the human psyche of solving a problem that's presented in front of you that could potentially be dangerous. It's a reward chain and deserves more chain gets acted upon. Even if you're talking about nonsense, even if this is like some area 51 you know, Ufo body, fucking whatever it is, Roswell, New Mexico, the guy who was there, the gut, the general talk to my grandma.

Speaker 3:          00:39:54       Yeah. He told me about the coffins, four foot tall coffin. There were little alien babies. I took him to the back of the hearse. They had embalmed and Mike. My aunt saw it and they killed her in the forest. Like stop, stop. I know I can't, but when you have an explanation you don't feel as unsafe. Yeah. If you, if I tell you that there are random things that happen. For example, the shooter in Las Vegas, he was 64 and there are no signs. He was very controlling. If you look at these good bit of a sociopath, he had, we had this obsession with control. But, uh, if I just tell you that sometimes people wig the fuck out and they just want to shoot a bunch of people, that's not appropriate because then what's going to happen? It's anxiety medication. Sure. But I'm sure, but there's also like, when you say that stuff, it's like, now what you're saying is I have no real way to protect myself.

Speaker 3:          00:40:39       Even if I carry a gun and take all my vitamins, wear my seatbelt. There's always some crazy shit I didn't think about. It's called faith. The people I've talked to, um, that, that understand, um, psych medicines that I've talked to, some psychiatrists I've had on the podcast, listen to Kelly Brogan. Kelly Brogan talked about it quite extensively. One of the things that she went, her and many other psychiatrists brought up is the disassociative properties have a lot of these psych medicines that someone might have a horrible idea in their head, but the repercussions of it are real. Like acting on it feels real. But as soon as you have some sort of heavy disassociative psych medicine that's not even real, like you don't care anymore. You're like, you're like, wow, like watching yourself in a movie or something. You're, you're, you're Ron. Something that Dole's all the highs and the lows.

Speaker 3:          00:41:25       It puts you in this weird state where it's okay, it's okay. It's okay to just kill these people. Like I don't know whether or not you could, the leap from being a person who could never kill somebody to be in a person doesn't have a problem with killing somebody. I don't know if that's true. I mean, maybe that's a, that's a Chaz. I'm too far to cross. But I guarantee you if you're the type of person that is having some horrible thoughts about like being aggressive to people and then someone puts you on something that makes you like, I don't give a fuck. Like it's gonna. It's gonna. If you are Ha, who knows what the right chemical is too, right? Like if they give you the wrong one, maybe it'll switch you one way or the right one. We'll turn the other way. Or maybe we should add some abilify into the mix.

Speaker 3:          00:42:09       Just throw some of this in there. This is an antipsychotic to help you all even out. Do you know you can have a lesion on your brain? The size of the head of a pen. You can have a lesion and if it's in the right, there's a specific area of the brain where it can be a tiny lesion that you can't see really barely with the naked eye and it can render you a homicidal maniac. Doesn't my problem fighting off the leash? I got lesions in my brain. Is that true? Yeah. What is it called? What's the leaves? Don't know. I could look it up for you, but it's by eye. But you can use where I heard it was in a lecture by Daniel Robinson who is a professor at Oxford and Georgetown and the smartest man on the planet. That's why you have to really be careful when you're punching people in the head, right?

Speaker 3:          00:42:50       Yeah. Yes sir. That's why it causes, well, so the guy who, who does that make sense? Neuroscience. Who captured the 13 year old girl? Not Elizabeth. SMART, but the other one had two children with her, kept her for 18 years and she escaped. Finally. Yes. That was the guy that was, were were, were to he and his wife. It was somewhere in like, I think Seattle is basement. Right. You got him in the backyard, in a shed for an a in a, in a sealed about shedding and they lived in the backyard with the daughters until, I mean literally she was 18 then they would go out once in a while. It was real Stockholm Syndrome shit. Oh my God. Then she, oh, crazy. Yeah. And, and she, but she got, he got her pregnant at 13 and it was just a terrible story I was going to tell you about earlier.

Speaker 3:          00:43:28       Did you, did you see the footage where they have their selling slaves in Libya? Is it Libya or is it Iraq? It's Libya. There was, maybe it's in Iraq too. Yeah. But it was Libya and they were, you know, there was a, I forget who the title it was usa today that had an editorial that said, thanks Hilary Clinton because Hilary Clinton, apparently they're blaming her decisions on the reason why we went into Libya and dethrone Mo Market Aafia who knows? Yeah. You would know maybe more than most, but video of migrants, soul and apparent slave auction in Libya provokes outrage worldwide. It's disturbing, man. When you watch it, they got guns to these dudes heads those photos. I retweeted it. If you want to go to my instagram, you can see some of the pictures of it. But they have like Libya is a failed state now. Yes. And it's God damn terrifying in, um, 2017. Look at that in, in 1970 and my father just told a story at, uh, at Thanksgiving and he was talking how Dubai

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       and Abu Dhabi have become these incredible countries. And when he was first there in 1970 and 1971, I don't know what it was. Um, somebody said, you see that woman over there and she was a black woman. She was from Africa somewhere and uh, I supply, I said yes, he goes, that's a slave. And that was in Dubai, I believe back in the day. I'm sorry to anybody from Dubai. I know you guys have come a very long way, but slavery was the, was order of the day for in a lot of countries. I'm not just picking on you in a lot of countries and a lot of countries, it was, it was the order of the day. I mean the idea that slavery would no longer be a case. The idea that this would be outrageous to the world, um, in 1940 would be certainly in 1910 or something, it would have been like what now it will always go on.

Speaker 4:          00:45:16       Slavery's is, uh, is, is in order, is the way of life. I mean, you know, I think though today with the ability to film slave auctions when your cell phone and then stream that shit I [inaudible] dot com or whatever this is, the more you learn about people and how, how similar we all are and how, you know, Sam Harris had a really interesting ted talk about this, about the idea that you, you have to be able to have a conversation about what is the most optimal way to live for a human being. What is the most optimal? Is it, is it true that women are at their best when having to wear a full Burka in 120 degree heat? That's a good question. Is, is, and by the way, are all opinions are welcome at the table. Are you interested, I'm quoting Sam here, but are you interested in the Taliban's point of view on physics?

Speaker 4:          00:46:06       No. And, and does, there's someone who does, does for that matter and he talks about himself is his point of view on string theory, which he knows nothing about. Uh, as valid as somebody who studies string theory. No, no, but we get it. There's a tendency to kind of go, well, you know, that's your culture and I'm not going to get involved in it, even though it's might seem brutal by my standards. You hear this a lot with like the aztecs and human sacrifice, and it's very taboo to talk about how it was Barbara, cause you know, that was them. You and me and Steven Rinella had a conversation about that. Rinella literally didn't believe me when I told them they sacrificed 80,000. Was it? Is that the number was a number when they'd sacrificed the, the, the, um, the people who are not a huge sign of ICAN, temple of [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          00:46:51       Is that how you say it too? Alcon, but apparently they'd sacrificed some fucking insane number of slaves. So it's so crazy that if you tell a rational personally, Steve Rinelli, he's like, why I can't, I can't be true until you go and read about it. And he'd go, how, how horrible where people then, yeah, they could sacrifice. I really want to say it was 80,000 people then. That was the number, the numbers, I don't know. I mean, that's a crazy, it's like in a couple of days, they, all the people that worked on the temple apparently after it was over, they just sacrificed them. Wow. Wow. Just a minute. The aztecs, they, one of the things they say is Cortez to able to conquer the aztecs much, easily over a lot more easily because

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       the aztecs had neighbors that fucking hated them because they aspects would go in and basically if you weren't, you know, an Aztec, which means you a person of the son, you'd get sacrificed. So their neighbors were like, are you Spanish guys? 500 guys really will help you. 100% of those. Fuck, we hate him. You know? So have you been to cheech and Eatsa? No, dude, there's a fucking platform and cheech needs, so with the Mayans used to behead people, they have the sacrifice. There was this, there's this like thing, it's like a demon. It's lying on its back. And they would sacrifice the people and the stomach area where they sacrificed people. It was kind of grooved out from all the bodies had been slicing on it day on. Well, that's why. That's why, oh my God, I'm wrong. It's way more is high. It's estimates.

Speaker 3:          00:48:18       The number of persons sacrifice and central Mexico in the 15th century was as high as 250,000 per year. But um, go to the construction of temple a t I don't know how to say this. He, I contentious number by the way. Of course it is. And people, like people, a lot of people were like bullshit. And there's a lot of historians that had did the, and publishing my book, Bro, I'm jacking it up 100,000. If I was, if I was a a historian, I was like, yeah, 40 million people died on the shores. Although the whole male population was trying to be warriors. It was, uh, you know, what is the, uh, c just google 80,000 aztecs sacrificed temple of tea. I don't know how to say the word icon to a con. I forget out. How'd he say it? But I believe what they did was they built this fucking spectacular struck, spectacular structure and then killed everybody worked on it.

Speaker 3:          00:49:10       They just killed the union. Kind of like El Chapo when you'd build a tunnel for him and he's like, can know where it is. Sorry, could, could you talk apparently to have a party for him and then you guys, thanks for working on the tunnel. They have a party to toast champagne and here's some lead poisoning as well. Super, super hammered when hookers and then shoot him in the head while they're sleeping and can't have people know. They said that the Soviets would do that. Like when, when you would build a tunnel, did you ever hear that story about how we figured out that implementer, what does this, this is it I say that will make that larger please. Uh, tiene no tiene, no Chit [inaudible]. Hmm. Um, I don't think that's the same one. I 80,000 came up with it because that's the number of people. Okay. Maybe I've seen it said, well, I think also when one of the things you have to deal with when you're dealing with a, an English deciphering of really ancient Aztec and Mayan code is that it's phonetic. So like there's sounds that they made that they're trying to replicate with English words, but they weren't really designed for English lettering, you know? I mean, they're designed, they're hieroglyphs, they have the, they, the way they wrote and spoke. It's very, very different than the way we do. You know, they had a, um,

Speaker 7:          00:50:28       like some of the Mayan writing in particular. What does it say there, Jamie? He troward thousands of, um, some of the, the um, God, some of the Mayan languages were like images that like, like the tenants, we kind of described it this way. He was like, you have a, like an eyeball and a picture and then you'd have a saw and you'd have a, the bug, the ant, an ant, and then you'd have the flower, the rose. And that's how you would say I saw aunt rose. That's a weird, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because we just assume that everyone should, what is like, what is writing? Writing is some symbols that you make that correspond to certain sounds that we've all agreed in our own personal definitions that we have. And in societies, we've all agreed that this sound means a certain thing. We argue the parameters of what that means. Right? And that's why people get super offended when someone says it like, uh, like words are violence. Okay, okay. Like you're, you're fucking with the real.

Speaker 4:          00:51:30       Exactly. Don't know if violence and never been punched in the face. You haven't seen somebody like get sold by all the silos. Say it's so important for young people to understand that the difference between things and, and there's a real tendency to equate, equate. For example, you wrote a memo at Google and it made an unsafe work environment for women and your healer. Now you're Hitler, Hitler. And by the way, you know, crab boats, coal mines and Navy Seals, they have a pretty dangerous work environment as well. So let's, let's, let's talk about the fucking difference because it's very, it's, it's, it gets very weird and dangerous and meaningless. And in fact, in my opinion, when you equate everything, when you basically say, you know, you, you shouted at me, that's assault versus breaking my nose. And we have lots of different examples of that. It does a disservice to people that have suffered real,

Speaker 7:          00:52:22       you know, violence. You know what I think is going on man, and I could sum it up in Warren word tribalism. There's a natural inclination that we have to form likeminded groups and defend our position to the death. And this is what people are doing. And it's not that you're wrong, he's right or he's right or wrong. It's that all of us are acting like people trying to protect our team. That's right. And that is a, it's an incorrect way of behaving. So if you say that like words are violence, like guess what? And

Speaker 4:          00:52:50       no, they're not. Go Fuck yourself too. Was that violent? This is what I say. I'm talking about this in my standup, but it, and, and you know, it's much easier to be full against something. It's really easy to be against that. We joined a team. What happens is you don't have to do the thinking. He let the, let the leader do all the thinking. You've got the bullet points. Now what your job as a soldier is to put down the other team. It's much more difficult. And think about this for young people listening, it's way harder to define what your, for defining what you're actually for. Like so if you're a revolutionary, you want to burn down the whole, the whole, you know the whole house. What are you going to replace it with men, that's really important and revolutionary. They did

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       with Libya. Revolutionaries. Forget that shit all the time about like when they came, they saw and he died. Right? You've got really good, bad guy. Cool. Now what? Now? What are you replacing it with? Yes. Well welcome to the power of vacuum. You hope you're going to be dead before this fucking becomes a disaster and a failed state. Well you're not. That's, that's my problem when when people, and we have a lot of people in our government that look at a problem and go, oh, it's isis. What we need to do is get authorization to kill more of them in other places. So what you're talking about is groups that identify as isis and that's going to solve the problem. My problem with that typically is that it goes back to that, one of my favorite sayings is it's not what you think. What you think is way less important than how you think.

Speaker 3:          00:54:05       Because a lot of times if you pay attention to your thinking exactly the way your enemies snaking, I'm not so sure that that's how you do it. I'm not so sure that bombing and shooting your way out of that problem is the way to go. It might be in some cases I think you need seal team six, et Cetera for certain shitheads but we can't see the Line of defense. Everyone has to know that they're real. Yeah. That's like one of the most important things about the elite forces of the government or of our military. He said people need to know the real. You need to know that's real cause like there's 100,000 whatever the fuck. There are people right now that are just ready to go. All you have to do is press a button launch. Thank God. Thank God for Tim Kennedy, etc. Exactly.

Speaker 3:          00:54:43       Cause remember this, you need walls, you need strong walls. Those walls. You haven't seen enough bad people. That's right. You don't cause there aren't, the Mongols are out there. They're out there. Yeah. Look at Libya. It's, you're out there. That's right. And these people, by the way, that are in the military that the only ones that are experiencing it, you're, you're back here. You're passing judgment on there saying, hey, there's zombies. Like, Hey, we'll let the fucking world's gone crazy. Hey, they're selling slaves in the streets. Like we need to all know that there are people that are in some really horrible parts of the world right now that can give you valuable information. It doesn't mean we should kill those people. It doesn't mean we should fucking nation build. But we need to be aware of the landscape and keep this in mind though too, is it's not.

Speaker 3:          00:55:26       That would be hard strength. You need men like, you know, Tim Kennedy, et Cetera. Those guys who are, who are our protectors, who we can push a button go, hey those fucking guys want. And there are people out there that want to kill us for sure. But I always think that it's also important to remember that those guys are doing that to protect the softer strengths in our community. The people that are creative, people that are inventing, you can't have a doctor working on a cure for cancer and had the Mongols come over and smash all his fucking beakers. Exactly. That's why you need those. So you need both. Problem is you knew you do need both. And the people on one side don't want to recognize the people and the other side cause they wished they didn't have to exist. Exactly what they do have to exist.

Speaker 3:          00:56:03       Of course they do. There's a balance to this fucking thing. You know, and here's the thing, people in Libya, if Kevin Spacey had a TV show in Libya, we fucked all the grips right in the mouth before every episode they would go. That's what he does. He's the fucking store. You would just talk with this stuff. Kevin's business, this, this bombs going off of the streets with your mouth open. Your mouth is fucking ied at every fucking dead dog on the side of the road. Kick them over. You lose your leg? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. He fucked your mouth. What's the appointment? He fucked your mouth. He's Kevin Spacey is Kevin's has to guys to present as you fucked your mom. Come on. You went to work or not to start off, what do you want to do? What you went to do, you went to live that isn't offensive.

Speaker 3:          00:56:50       Accents, personable. I don't even know why you do it because it doesn't sound like anyone that's ever lived. It's so offensive. No ones. It's not a bad accent. It's exactly what someone who doesn't know how to speak English with Sally. I would wish that I could speak Arabic so I could realize how fucking shitty my fee bad Arabic would be if I learned Arabic for a couple of years and tried to talk to those people. Make Fun of me. Go ahead. I give you full permission to make fun of an American pretending to be or trying to speak Arabic. Arabic is a very difficult language to learn. Too hard for me to hide my friend, my friend. It's so hard. It's such a rich language compared to like French Haley. Give Kevin Spacey a race if he was in Libya. If you had a show in Livia, Netflix, Libya would give them a raise would go, this is method duct.

Speaker 3:          00:57:41       This is our president would do fuck them out of everyone. He can. Fuck. This is what I like. How you are behaving as a president all the time. Go Frank Underwood is a fucking grade. Just pull out a machine gun. Shoot through the fucking ceiling just in the room. Kiss him on the mouth and Lee's not a bad fucking that's, that's a good, you play a good Arab desk pot dude. Who's a pervert. This, this is what you'd do. You'll fuck every once a month. Do you have the president will have to it. There's nothing I can do it. They just get drunk as fuck on, on booze made out of camel pice. I take camel piss and they mixed wheat. Hear about how the president of the longtime dictator of Yemen got power. He was a major in the army. Oh, I'm scared. He just showed up at uh, like he was there.

Speaker 3:          00:58:27       He was just going to be one of the majors. And the president was having a cabinet meeting and apparently you can look this up, Jamie. Apparently he basically put a briefcase down or a suitcase down and just pull out two guns and went, well cln or Kush, Kush, Kush, Kush, Kush, and wild. The entire decapitated. The government goes, I'm in charge now. Uh Huh. Uh Huh. Uh Huh. Well you was it. It's in the 70s you ever see what a Pistol Grip Uzi looks like? See you later. And then he rolled the nation with what's called an iron fist for about 30 years. I'm sure you watched Narcos, right? I certainly have. How about that fucking show? How about Pablo Escobar? Amazing. You know what's crazy is apparently Columbia's bounced back tremendously and Columbia is like a really cool place to visit. I've heard, I've had friends who've been there, I want to go badly, and that they're most, they saved the most beautiful people voice, certainly the most beautiful women on the planet where the famed, it's just amazing that they bounced back so quickly from being under control of a drug, Lord.

Speaker 3:          00:59:30       Yeah. You know that the Pablo Escobar story is so goddamn crazy. It is crazy. Ladies and gentlemen, you do not live forever. Listen to me, make coke legal. It'll solve 80% of our problems. Just make coke, legal, Agri, just make coke legal. I agree. Are we really pretending that whiskey is any better than coke? We really pretending that. I don't know coke. I don't do coke. Coke is even better cause it's devastating quickly. So you do a lot of cooked. You can drink for 40 years and before you realize you're like, holy fuck, I don't have a house or anything else. Yeah you fucking do below duplo everyday for three years and come talk to me and see how your life works at night.

Speaker 7:          01:00:07       I think that less people would be inclined to do it if you made it legal and then let everybody see the consequences of its use in a realistic way. I think probably part of the problem with things being illegal is that people can't choose for themselves. And if people can't choose themselves, it's forbidden and forbidden things

Speaker 3:          01:00:25       just like that blank deck back during the revolutionary war come more tasty. They become more test day duck or a barrier to switching.

Speaker 7:          01:00:37       I mean that's all forbidden and stuff, but you can't, human beings should not be able to tell it. This is the bottom line. Yeah. Human beings should not be able to tell other human beings what they can or can't do with their own bodies where it doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense. If you have some things that are illegal like cigarettes and some things that are legal like whiskey that I don't have a problem with. Cigarettes being legal and I don't have a problem with whiskey being legal and you should be able do whatever you want, but I think it should be with all of the things like why, how come these things right? Why can't, you know, do you telling me that whiskeys legal, but mushrooms aren't like that's what year is this? What are we doing? Are we pretending? We pretending there's no science. I we in wishcraft days or no? Yeah. Let me know when the witchcraft days are over because I would say witchcraft should be over now. Yeah. So if it's over now we have to look at science. Right? Right. Yeah. Okay. Well you can't let me by oxytocin from or Oxycontin from the fucking pharmacy. You can't let go scissor control because I stubbed my fucking toe.

Speaker 3:          01:01:36       Yeah. What do you think would happen if we, we made cocaine legal would win with consumption. Go Up. Yes. For a little bit. Yeah. A lot of girls would show their inner ho did let it out. A lot of dudes and business debt that they'll never fucking complete. That's that Joe was that joke. Cause like when you do cocaine, you want to start a business together. The joke, funny. Great Joke. It's so true. So true. I mean open a doughnut shop. What the fuck we doing to talk to you about their passion? Yeah. Passion. It's a weird drug to be around. I was in Jamaica and I, I don't, I'm not a big truck guy, but I did, I did a bag of coke, a whole bag. A guy sold it to me. I was smoking weed and this guy was willing, we're hanging. He goes, do you ever do blow

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       was like, I'm not a big cotton, not a drug guy. I don't even smoke weed much. And he goes, try this. And I did one line of cocaine, Jamaican cocaine, and I was like, this must have fallen off a boat because this shit's got a yellow little thing to it. And I was like, first of all, I'm the coolest motherfucker on the planet. Second of all, we're going to play ping pong for good three hours. Third of all, they're going to go to my fucking hotel room and I'm going to wake my girlfriend up and tell her that I'm a genius and then wait for it. I'm going to write for three, four hours, keep doing cocaine, and I'm going to change my career because I'm gonna write a three hour a bit on how God is a roster foreign. How funny is that? And I wrote stand up and God has Ross foreign kept waking my girlfriend, I'm going, I'm writing the funniest shit.

Speaker 4:          01:02:59       You're not completed. She was like, you wait all this. And I looked at it, then I passed out. I have to before my heart could give out. And I looked at the shit I wrote about eight hours later and it was just, it was basically God's a roster and he speaks like a Jamaican. And that was the joke. And I thought it was brilliant when I was fucking doing the blow in the right state of mind. If you captured that idea, like if you gave that bit to Dave Chappelle. Sure. He maybe he could make something. Not Brian Calvin. He's high on cocaine in Jamaica. It's like you would need to to figure out what the fuck you were trying to say. Like I've written things down on marijuana and I, oh, I'll figure it out when I'm sober. But then you try to read it when you're sober and you're like, tell the fuck was my point.

Speaker 4:          01:03:39       Yeah. What is the point here? Yeah, but they did studies on people on drugs. I think cocaine and had them play music musicians and stuff, and they were like, I thought I was amazing. And then they listen to what they're planning. Like, Oh, what the fuck? Well, the Arctic was made. What killed the music after 1968 it was, you know, the Monterey Music, I mean rock and roll festival with John Hendricks and the Mamas and Papas. So what, what, what gave birth? That renaissance was marijuana and psychedelics. That that was it. That enhance the music. Oh, for sure. Cocaine and heroin came in. You've got this fucking killed. It killed it. People die. Yes. Literally Boogie man. Well, that was last year. Some of that shit is good. Yeah, there's a lot of good stuff, but it's the idea behind that music. Like how about showgirls? Showgirls, that movie would not exist if it wasn't for cocaine.

Speaker 4:          01:04:28       That movie is a Goddamn cocaine movie that movie's a move where you could see the blood coming out of their nose while they were watching the edit. It's like, keep that in. No, fucking keep that. Can you make it longer or flopping in the pool? Oh, it's a terrible movie. Duff fucking sex scene between the girl from saved by the bell. What is her name? Elizabeth something. Berkeley Berkeley. Who was the dude? Kyle mcglaughlin clank. That guy, she was on naked who? She's a very beautiful, but there's a scene when they were in the pool where they're making love Brian Cowen. Yep. And if a girl was doing that, if you are having sex with a girl that you were having sex with a girl and she started doing that, you would immediate and I know you, you're a pervert. He would still immediately call a doctor. You, you is perverted as you are, as much as you love ladies.

Speaker 3:          01:05:19       So I got sentenced to be that Kyle mclachlan golf, Elizabeth Berkley, and she's wrapped around and she's flopping around in the pool. You would call the police, call the police. This is only part of it. So this is okay, I can handle this. This pitch is getting crazy. Woo them titties are flopping. First of all, if you're calm, mclachlan, walk one couple shoots all over your own face. Here's the problem. His problem, she starts flailing. Oh cool. It's like throwing herself back. Got a call, the doctor not, and by the way, he blew out both his rotator cuffs in the scene. He had to get both of his shoulders completely reconstructed. I only hope you're telling me shut up. Fuck that. He tore his Labor. Him. He tore the bicep tendon from the bone. Goddammit. She's flopping around like she's dying. Go. You gotta let me know if you're going to do that. You can't just them because if you just die for like girls just lit. She's crazy. Yeah. You might pray. Let you a break my dick too, but foot if I let her die. What have you let her die like you asshole. She was having a seizure. You kept, you came inside of her. She was having us

Speaker 8:          01:06:27       seizure and you came inside of her dude. What the fuck? I thought I thought you was just freaky. You didn't see we have a video of it. You didn't see there was something wrong with her. You fucking selfish all you care to problems coming. Yeah, she was dying, man. She's flipping around. She can't breathe. She hasn't seen anymore. Oh, oh, oh, I gotta take it easy. How can you raping her here? You're holding onto her. You keeping her inside of you. Just let her go. There's no way she's trying to just go on for, can you get

Speaker 3:          01:07:03       a whiff of it? It's just on repeat. Oh, sorry. Get away. She's trying to get away. All right, well, congratulations on all that. There's nothing funny about rape, ladies and gentlemen, but this isn't rape and that's why I made a joke. Okay. I'm holding my, I'm, I'm like, it's a joke about something you absolutely know is definitely not rape and I'm being ridiculous joke. Yeah. Everybody. It's funny how you to that nowadays in today's call. I know, I know. You're ready. I know. You ready to get mad at me. Don't get mad at me. Everybody. We need to stop doing this. We need, we need to figure out what to be so literal. Yeah. Being so literal. Start start realizing this with, we had real problems in the world and they've Kevin space things about example. I was just trying to be funny about the Libyan.

Speaker 3:          01:07:42       Yeah. Don't let Chapman's basic grab your deck. I get it. I get it. I'm not saying that that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is we just need to be super cognizant of the fact that there is a real highly likelihood that we have achieved the highest level of civilization the world has ever known. It's right now, and we need to be aware of that. We made progress. In other words, in any massive. Yeah, and any seemingly important thing that you want to go off on. You're taking energy away from recognizing the fact that we need to,

Speaker 7:          01:08:16       the crucial elements of this amazing thing that we have right now, and one of the things that we have to do is we've got to avoid this weird tribalism that I keep talking about tribe I thinking because it's not just sexual, it's political, it's socioeconomic. It's fucking blue collar guy. And I'm like, no, you're a fucking person. Yeah. We're all just,

Speaker 4:          01:08:36       well, you're in a trap. Human beings are, were, were genetically predisposed to be tribal. It's US versus them.

Speaker 7:          01:08:43       Pass that. If we're a tribe, okay, we should be tried. Planet Earth. There's famous Ronald Reagan's speech. Remember that Ronald Reagan's speech, he gave a speech, I'd want to say it's in front of Congress, but he gave a speech where he was talking about how quickly we would set aside our differences if we were attacked by an alien force from another world. Right. And all of us would realize, yeah, just heat or the Cold War. I mean this is like look very scary times. Do you remember growing up were the same age worried about nuclear war? We were always worried. A real threat of nuclear annihilation was actually something we all thought about every day. Yes. And the, the further we're away from that, the more we forgot. And, but if you just pay attention to Libya, just pay attention to Afghanistan, pay attention to Iraq, pay attention to all sorts of parts of the world where North Korea things are not fucking stable at all. We are assuming the thing's going to stay stable because they're stable right here, but we're all on the same God damn planet. Yeah. And that's a real problem. It's a real problem. And I think we're better at figuring this out than we have ever been before. But there's a lot of hiccups and bumps along the way. But one of the things it's going to eliminate a good percentage of them is if we can isolate tribalism and see it when it's happening and call it for what it is and avoid it.

Speaker 4:          01:09:59       And it's very, it's very tough now the tough, and I'll tell you why, because they used to be one of the great people always was talking about how religion was responsible for so much violence, but they always forget. Religion was also responsible for a great deal of unification. So there was a national narrative in this country, right? We were a Christian nation for a long time in this country. And there was a national narrative. There were just certain things that people collectively agreed upon. And usually it started in the church, or at least it had its values in the church. I would argue that, you know, even our constitution has been greatly influenced by the Judeo Christian ethic. Uh, all men are created equal, for example, as a Christian idea. Did you, there's no way to prove it biologically are mathematically, but it's something we all kind of, it's a nice starting point.

Speaker 4:          01:10:42       It's literally what our justice system is predicated on. All men are created equal. Even though Lebron James and I have totally different genomes and he's an Avatar and we're not equal. If you kill me, you kill Lebron. You do the same amount of time in jail. Theoretically, that would be the idea behind our thing. He should be worth more. He shouldn't be worth a little bit more than that. I would agree. I would agree. And, and what's really interesting is how different we are, how we like all strive not to be equal, right? I want to be better than everybody else, but we believe in it. It's a really nice starting point. You know, something that I read that's like really important. I always bring it up. It's

Speaker 3:          01:11:12       people that free will or the ability to do whatever you want. The uh, like, uh, a freedom of expression of freedom of pursuits breeds inequality. Because if you give people true total freedom, some people are going to try harder than others. Some people are going to be a bad thing. Some people want to be Tyler Perry and have a fucking island. Yeah. Did the big, they remembered. There's a fundamental difference, right? Well Simmons, between being American and a communist and American believes in equality of opportunity. I'm not saying we have that, but that would be the goal. Then there's equality of outcome. The only way to have equality of outcome is to keep down the people that work harder at, they're smarter and more talented. Yeah. You got to make everybody equal. That's to me a fundamental evil. That is, that's my problem with Marxism. What the fuck you, the only way to do this with force, it's the problem is it's never worked.

Speaker 3:          01:12:00       No. I sent everyone worked and it almost always leads to like mass murder. Right, exactly, but nobody wants to think that because the idea behind is beautiful. Okay, so need to compete. We should just share money and Sharewell Pol Pot, Mao Tse Tung Hitler and Stalin dictatorships. Hitler was more of a fascist. Yeah. People also don't realize that the Nazis were the national socialists. That's right. The real problem with the idea in execution, but the idea in the most romantic view possible is that we don't need to compete with each other. We don't need to be greedy. And then we could all share resources and wealth and we all get along and have income equality. But I see this, I think it's important to recognize the thought behind the best version of that. Right? The thought behind the best version of that is someone that just really wants to be an amazing person.

Speaker 3:          01:12:49       Right. And they really want other people to be amazing people as well. I want everybody to be fine. They strive for everybody to get along. So let's just like combine our wealth. We don't have to get rich, delicious, like provide for the poor. It's super important. Let's like give healthcare to everybody before anything. Hey man, we don't need the military. Let's just relax. Okay. You're going to get invaded, right? As a matter of time before the Russian shows borders. Yes. And they're going to fuck your mouth. Yes. But on that, let me pick it back up and doing that forever. Remember that the idea of Adam Smith's idea and the idea behind making money was also that when you are rich and when you were an Aristocrat, you have a responsibility to give back to your community. That's very, that was, that was very much ingrained in the British sensibility and even in the American aristocracy, like the Kennedy's in this country, rich and you have a responsibility.

Speaker 3:          01:13:34       Correct. Bill Gates, one of the boys, it'll cases in gendered himself with a lot of us is that if he does an amazing amount of charity, amazing, amazing, creative with it too. And by the way still lives like a fucking gangster. It's not even like it's putting a dent in his lifestyle. I mean he's, he's helping so many people out with the Bill Gates Foundation. That's the same thing. Warren Buffet gave his kids up, now it's up to $7 billion. He was like, go make the world a better place. And, and, and he's got all kinds of charities. But that is by all accounts a super sweet guy. Yes, they're really humble. But went back to what you were talking about about how we're breaking into tribes. I think that we have lost any kind of national narrative, and what I mean by

Speaker 3:          01:14:11       that is that people don't even trust their own institutions with the crumbling of any kind of like religious institution. It seems that now people are looking for, they don't trust main sources of information so they don't trust most of the mainstream media has earned their shitty reputation. Cause now it's about clickbait. Now it's about kind of creating some that you want to be first. Not True. Being true is not as important as being the first one with the story and Blah, blah, blah. I think that there's certainly our agendas with liberal media, conservative media, they both have their own agendas of shit that people do. Exactly. So what happens is people, I think media's favor abilities and the single fucking digits or something like that though among most Americans. Let me give you an example of how this works. Sometimes. I'm somebody who wrote a good article about the debate that Eddie Bravo and I had about the world being flat, but the art, the, the title of the article was Joe Rogan argues with someone about the world being flat.

Speaker 3:          01:15:07       So it seems like you saying that the world is flat, so you immediately click it, but right away the first sentence has, God bless Joe Rogan, and then he was in a conversation with his friend who was arguing with the possibility and then like, but like, okay, I see what you did. Yeah, I kind of let you hooked him. You got it. You did it. You did it right. It's okay. But because of that, it, even though it's very insignificant, a bunch of people have said to me, bro, you used to believe the fucking earth was flat. I saw that. I was like, no. Yeah, I bet you didn't. They didn't see CNN and Huffington post both. Do they all do that? I can't stand either one of those. I think CNN, Huffington post started terrible, but both of them do that. They, they'll, they'll hit you with this.

Speaker 3:          01:15:50       Like Donald Trump just said one word to change the entire presidency. Let me see what the fuck you fuck. Yeah, Dude. Keith Olbermann is signed off is one of my favorite things to watch. I like him. He's a, he's a a spicy character, super liberal, but I liked him anyway. We're liberal. But I think you have to have that look. I'm a, at least who I am right now. I'm an open minded, friendly person that allows for all ideas. Yes. Keith Olbermann is as far left as you're going to get. And I liked the fact that he was out there. I think having a wacky dude out there standing in front of a cable access show background with red on one side and blue on the other. And he's got his notes in front of them and he's wearing a tie and delivers these super eloquent like dissertations.

Speaker 3:          01:16:39       But he's decided he's going to step away. And uh, he said he's retiring from politics because he thinks that donald trump's done. He'd done it. He thinks Donald Trump, he lists a series of things. Keith Overman, it says he's retiring from political Calamari. Yeah. And he lists a series of things. Oh, you're no good for him. He's a fucking formative. He knows his shit. I would not want to debate that guy. You know what to say. She did one dude. He did one thing though. That was pretty fucking stupid. What was that you knew when that Tomi Lahren girl, um, she, she's like a conservative hot chick, hot white girl with blonde hair. No, she put a flag on like, she was like holding up a flag and a photo and he wrote something about not, you shouldn't use the flag that way. And then Donald Trump Jr tweeted a photo of the two of them together with her, with the flag and keep opening, then wrapped in a flag and said, you know something about him being stupid.

Speaker 3:          01:17:36       Some, some funny thing that's also caddy to say that it stopped being catty with this fucking tall ships. And I understand you don't like her because she's a hot girl that's a conservative and she says ridiculous shit sometimes and she does. But like you gotta save your attacks. You can't throw rocks at every target. You can't stop for every dog that barks on the way home or you never get home. This is why George Washington talked about the importance of civility. You need civility if you start attacking each other. If I start, you know I heard a rumor that Donald Trump in meetings when he was negotiating somebody car, he go, oh Jesus, your breath, holy fuck. You get the worst breath and the age just gets you on your heels. He'd be like, what does it do that? Yeah, he apparently, that was some of the tactics.

Speaker 3:          01:18:16       He would just insult you and get you off your pins. You're emotional and you're insecure about your breath. Now. You can't talk as much. You know the little techniques. I think Donald Trump would be super fun if he was like your uncle that you were going to take your girlfriend to when you first started dating. Like say if you dated a girl and it's like three months in and you're in love and you're, you're parked outside your uncle's house and like, listen, we're going to spark, sparked this joint and we're going to go meet my fucking crazy uncle. He's beautiful, he's flawed, but he's crazy and don't look at his hair and we're just going to leave. And then like when he talks about himself, just seem fascinated and you passed the, you guys are lucky. I'm here and you'd go in there so high that you're barely alive.

Speaker 3:          01:18:59       So you got like 180 beats per minute. Your Heart's going. What are we doing dude? I, I golfed with his caddie, Obama's caddy. George W's caddy and Cameron. I know you golf three times. Yes. Thank you very much. Three times. Those guys at the same guy. The same guy. Same Guy. Same Guy. Oh caddy for all the one number makes it sound like there's three camps. No, I wish. No, no. And he said, he said Best Golfer in the group, hands down by far. Donald Trump, he said, and t they didn't, doesn't like trump but, but basically said he's very nice, very funny and crack them as they looked at me, he, I didn't think I'm doing. And Cameron was like, I think it got to be a lot on your plate. And then apparently he drove by there. I just club and key largo whenever Mar Largo and these people were there and he just bought as they were driving by in the car, he goes, you guys have any idea how lucky you are, you're in the best club in the world.

Speaker 3:          01:19:48       And he just kept driving. He's, he's a very entertaining dude. I'm, I'm a little bummed out at myself that I didn't do celebrity apprentice. Really? Yeah. Because uh, the celebrity apprentice was available when we were doing the second run, a fear factor and they asked me to do it and I was one of the, were on NBC. I was like, God, I want to move my family to New York for a few months and like maybe, and you know, Mrs Rogan was down for it, but I was like, I don't know if that's a smart move. It seems like a lot of work for something that's not really my thing. I don't, I don't really want it do it that kind of wish I did it. He has no trump. Yeah. I don't know how well you get to know them. Get to know him. If you let me hang onto them.

Speaker 3:          01:20:27       Yeah, I'm sure he's letting me be close to smell you. I'm sure he'd be a blast. I'm sure he'd be a lot of fun because it's one of those lives. Maybe I could talk to them to fix things. Maybe we could just tell him to just take it down a notch. It would be okay. He's not interested in, the problem with him is that he's not interested in what he doesn't know. I, that's how I feel. Maybe I feel like we could have a sit in with homeboy. Yeah. Just to just him. You get him on his podcast, come out. It's wearing him out. Just relax. Relax. He never drinks. It doesn't course that's the problem. It's part of the problem. Like you need a separation from the normal states of consciousness. Otherwise you're acting on momentum your entire life, so you like a child.

Speaker 3:          01:21:03       They did it. They did a psychological profile that I thought it was interesting on him, which was that he's always been on the outside. So his dad wasn't allowed to be part of the developers in New York. He had to go elsewhere and he was always kind of like kept out. And he is now in the media. So his way of, uh, and I think Roy Cohn, the infamous lawyer, um, was his mentor and said, attack, always attack to meet any threat with an attack. He listened to the reason why he's president is because Obama mocked him at the press corps conference. Remember that? Remember that press corps dinner meeting thing? And Obama mocked him and said, I'm one thing that you're never going to be. And that's the president. And he's go, oh, for real? Yeah, I'm fucking older than you knew. Can I lock? I'm ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          01:21:48       Look at my hair and I'm still going to be the president. How about you go fuck yourself? How about you don't know what you're dealing with here? How about he was amazing. He was so amazing. And the debates, he was so entertaining. It was funny. And even George. Jeff Bush said, you can't insult your way to the White House, my friend. Yeah, you can't change. You can, you definitely can. When you're fighting. Look, it's like what's, what's really ironic is one of the things that's come out to over turn your notes things both punters I don't, but I do know about is talking shit, I'm good at talking shit and I understand the strategies behind talking shit. And one of the strategies behind talking shit was that Hillary felt very confident that if she could get donald into a position of being the primary candidate against her, she would have an easy path to the White House because she felt like Donald was so ridiculous that there the other candidates by even being associated with him in the same party, there would be revolt. It would be chaos. And if he won he'd be an easy target. And there's all this like written banter back and forth where she was trying to connect him with the most ridiculous people. Like, of course, you know, there was a, there's just all this like strategy with Ted Cruz where they had this idea of how they would make them all look, marginalize, easy path, the White House, and he just threw a monkey ridge

Speaker 7:          01:23:06       right into that theory. It's like stupid. I'm the worst person for you to argue. I'm going to say, I'm going to say you should be in jail. Lock her up, lock her up, and I'll make shit up to make up my own facts. If I have to, I'll do whatever I want and I'll get caught on tape talking about how girls just let you grab him. The Pussy. Yeah, just a few weeks out. Yeah, no problem. It was locker room talk. Not a problem. Let's talk about uranium. Dude, I thought he was done when I heard that. I thought, oh, he's definitely done no precedent. By the way. What's really shocking? What was it? 44% of the white women voted for him because they want that Dick. Well, they weren't that. They weren't that offended by it, I guess. Right. This is a lot of women right now that just shut off this podcast.

Speaker 7:          01:23:49       You fucking asshole. Right when I was starting to think you weren't an asshole. It's just comedy. I don't really think that 44%. I think people didn't like Hillary. They didn't trust her. I think if you looked at what it is in terms of like, um, like good versus evil, it's known evil versus unknown, you know, it was, I think it's unknown. He's known evil or known corruption versus a sideshow. Like sort of a guy who's going to be really entertaining for the next four years but probably won't bring the republic down. But what if he decides to really look out for the American people? What if he decides to make America great again? What if he decides to bring back engineering and bring back production of goods and fucking what if he decides that? What if you really decided that then is it better to take a chance?

Speaker 7:          01:24:34       And I think a lot of people did that. I agree. And then I also think we were realizing, and we should, this is something we need to all come to grips with. It is irrational, illogical, nonsensical, an antiquated to have one person have that much power in the United States of America. It is nonsense. It's not something we need. It is a, it's a, it's a value system and a ruler leadership system that's designed for small groups of people and it works very well, works very well for groups of hundred and 50 people at leaves over their dicks. But as soon as you get to 320 million people all trapped together on a landmass, you cannot have one dip shit that's good at insulting people and standing in front of a camera. I don't care if it's him or the next guy or the, it's on a assault on Donald Trump.

Speaker 7:          01:25:24       It's like one person who figures out a way to fucking manipulate and dance and do his best. America's got talent, fucking preppers, a presentation, presentation, representation. One of those things to get to the point where people go, ah, the other lady's boring and she keeps fainting. Boom and they kill. They hit the switch for trump. I mean, one of the things that president always talks about and governors talk about is how little power they have. You say that, but there's real problems right now with the environmental protection agency being defunded. There's real problems right now with them deciding to start drilling in places in Alaska that people have been fighting for them for decades

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       because they're worried that in extracting minerals from the ground, they're going to ruin these salmon waterways. Well, he can eat, he can hit mine judges and he can, he can appoint judges. You do a lot of things and obviously that cost is a big stir in political discourse and people being active and it's, you're seeing like some trans woman going to a got elected somewhere and gay people are getting elected papers and so you're seeing a a rebound, which is what? How does that work? That's right. He's, he's created a lot of civic unrest and a lot of civic organization on the other side. On the other side. Yeah. David from us talking about that. He is. Yeah, he just sent me his book. We just have to be really careful, like really careful of getting tribal with this. Again, I can't, can't, I hate to reiterate this, but I think that in looking at the group of humans as a whole, there's a real problem that on the left and on the right, people have with getting attached to their particular ideology they've adopted and fighting against anything that's any different and not coming to some sort of a common understanding of what we really need to get by in this plant.

Speaker 3:          01:27:06       It's called, it's called a couple of things. One is there are different psychological profiles and I've heard Jordan Peterson talk about sort of like the left is rooted in compassion and the right is rooted in respect for the strong. And then what happens is the way things move forward is you have an idea. I have an idea and remember something, it's very important. Human beings, uh, usually are weighing two values and their head at one time. Let me give you an example. I don't believe in illegal immigration, but I have a lot of compassion for people who are dying to get over the board. If I was a border control agent, I would probably be the guy who was like, come on and cause I have no, I'm emotional, right? Doesn't mean that's right. What it means is that I can sometimes you way to values in your head, right?

Speaker 3:          01:27:46       Mercy and compassion versus justice and fair play. Okay, let me propose something to you. Now, this is gonna sound crazy for a lot of people that were you. A full could call me at one point in time. I believe in the future we will not have boundaries in terms of places you're allowed to travel, not to travel, right? One point in time people would truly be thought of as equal and when that point in time happens, you'll allow people to freely travel all over the world. Why can't we do that now? First of all, you won't even have to travel. I think what's going to happen is when you can interface with another brain and that's, that's possible, you're going to have an experience about what it's exactly what it's like to be a woman. Exactly what it's like. By the way. It can be a woman.

Speaker 3:          01:28:29       I'm going to take it. I want to be a woman so I can see what it's like to have sexual Lebron James, but here's the thing, what if she would you complain, which you put your hands on her hips. I will. I'm only going to, I'm going to be able to experience it so then if I could interface with another brain, now we got a real problem because what the fuck does that mean about my identity? What if they can't? Like you can't pick what brand new interface with like you're going to be a girl out sex with a little broad james, but you're a 100 pound Irish girl like shit. Oh boy. You Ain't get your uterus blown. You know?

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       Yeah. Like you want like 178 pound chick from Ecuador that can really take it. I don't think any of that's going to happen. I think what's going to happen. So you can have guys like Lebron James who had these fantastic lives who have sex and dunk basketballs and they're gonna sell their experience. You want to interface with my brain, it's going to cost you this much money and that is going to be the new drug. Oh my God, the new drug is going to be, I want to see what it's like to be either, you know, whoever it is, the Brian James and will rise again. Correct. Dennis Robin will rise from the flames like a fucking phoenix. Be the number one superstar again in the world. And when you watch porn, you're going to be able to tap into the guy's brain and you're gonna be, I'll have sex with anybody you want.

Speaker 1:          01:29:43       So that's how you thinking about Dick. Just like he is. Imagine that unless you pay your head your favorite over to Dick and like, hey, he's thinking about Dick. This is a confusing, why am I coming on? I'm thinking about God, but ah, Shit. Dammit. People get mad at your yoga and money. Dick by that Brian Calla video. All the fucking homeboys got a giant Dick. But he's thinking about dudes bugs all the time the way, but he folks a little hubs, girls, doesn't matter man. While he's fucking all the hottest girls digging about dude's butts. Hold on. Dope, Bro. Did you come or not? Came immediately. Immediately I came like a terrorist wearing a wig in my mind. I came like a dude strap with dynamite, getting his dick sucked for the last time. Ooh.

Speaker 1:          01:30:30       It could give me and I took the headphones off like, fuck you Brian Cowen. Dammit. He's fucking the hottest girls. But took it about dude's butts. If friends and be like, man, I don't even know if he's telling the truth. I've been holding out for the Bryan count, virtual reality sex video. But now god, he's so medium and white. I don't want to think about Duke, right? I know. Oh, I told you I had a dream. I was gay, right a couple of times. Sorry about that. On a podcast before or after you had gay sex, uh, this was during, so I don't know if that makes sense. Dream I was game of gay in my dream. I was like, I can't believe I'm gay. This is so not what I'm into. And then I knew I was going to have to have sex with my boyfriend who may or may not have been Brendan Shop.

Speaker 1:          01:31:13       I can't remember. It was a big guy, a gate. You can't really bounce back and forth from, I don't know man. I've actually never really had a gay, we didn't talk to fattiest Russell, cause he'll tell you you're a liar. And then all men have some sort of gay fantasy somewhere deep in their head or 35 years, daddy has had a conversation about truth and versus like plural truths versus one fixed truth. That's a huge debate. You know what I mean by that? So like Nicha, what would be the guy to talk about? Plural truth. So if you look up at a painting, that painting, is there different truths, right? One is that painting's beautiful and that's all I know. It's a beautiful item. It, it affects me emotionally. That's the truth. Right? Then a chemist would look at that painting and say, well, you're not really seeing yellow. What you're seeing is you know your eyes are, are at light and then reflect.

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       There's a chemical in there and he'd break down a chemical. That's a different layer to truth. You're saying different kinds of true love, right? So true love. I don't know what the, that's still a really an interesting mystery to me because I wonder if that's a relationship with yourself. So sometimes you're obsessed with somebody, right? You love them. You might be obsessed with the idea of being the one that can break them. That can be the one that, that, that tames them, the one that owns them, the one that you know gets them to forget about all of the Dick and just yours. That's, that's what a lot of relationships are predicated on. This terror doesn't notion of territoriality, right? But does that true love, is that what we're talking about? Does it matter? But, but does, what really matter is the moments where you are together.

Speaker 3:          01:32:41       We truly care about each other, where the intensity is almost overwhelming and the love. And the happiness to be with each other. It's almost overwhelming. That is really true. Love all the other set of state though. And how long does it last? That's a good question. And whether or not you're committed to that person as a love, not just a love interest, but like as a, uh, an inhabitant in your, your realm of truly loved ones. Like what is your, your village of Trans Cynical answer for you on that. So, so I know what the Greek says. So why do you love your children? Why? What is it about your children that you love? And this is what socrates said. There's kind of an interesting way of looking at it. So he said love, difficult to define. You have to define it as love of something.

Speaker 3:          01:33:27       Right? And what is the one thing man loves more than anything else? Think about it. Post it, not close pussies. Part of it was these may be a manifestation of what you're trying to Ken from it. What is it? Come on attention. Why would you breed a, you want to get rid of Jews, goddammit. Goddammit, keep going. You got to think deeper bro. Like I needed to think the next level. Why? What is it the man loves more than anything else? What does he want more than anything else? I don't know. What does he want you to tell me? In mortality, you want to live forever. Exactly. What puts you at the gateway wherever with no plus kids and your kids are your genetic expression. Anybody worth a fuck do you, do you want to live forever with no pussy forever or live for a hundred years and just live like Jay z on a yacht and gold underwear with is dangerously. I want to live dangerously.

Speaker 3:          01:34:22       You want to live dangerously? Not Safely. Fuck, fuck. A thousand years old. 100 years. I'm excited. So what you're saying about any mortality is horse shit cause the mortality without pussy is nonsense. Immortality is represented in different things. Wash legacy. Listen to me sweetie. Yeah. If someone is in my circle of friends and somebody offers you in mortality with no pussy or a hundred years and pussy, if you don't take choice number two, lose my number. But hold on, hold on, stop. Stop texting her. I can't work with you. I would argue that your love of pussy might be genetically like you've evolved to

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       that. Your love was he is. Is your love of Pussy because you ultimately want to spread and further your DNA? Well, first of all, I think it would be very disrespectful. You as particularly, oh, of course. Giant. I met Vagina. I'm talking about sexual relationships. What about the gay folk? Gay Folk wouldn't want to be and then assess to actually instead of sex. Yeah. Instead of calling it pussy because the gay folk would be like, hey man, I'm with you, but you're excluding me. I'm one 10th of the population. Allegedly not one 38% corn. Sandy. Yes. Russell Thaddeus. It's what he says. He's head of dudes get hard and they see dudes getting the good stuff. Fucking do that. That's not true. That's not true. He didn't say that. He didn't say it. I like that. Yes. Yeah, me too.

Speaker 7:          01:35:36       But I think that the idea of not being in a sexually pleasurable relationship with someone for all of eternity, that sounds stupid.

Speaker 4:          01:35:46       First of all this he had said they do with men and women in longterm relationships. You know what the secret was? The long term, the West and there were C, they fucked. They had a deep sexual connection. Get the talk out of here that talked to me. I'm just friends with you. We have a deep friendship. You want to, you should want to fuck the person you should want to. Fuck I heard, but successful marriages are like that. Yeah. Why you make it? This is noise. This is what you do and your fuck right? Fingers and noises. That's all. Fuck no, I don't do that. I go, I go and I do a lot of slicking back here.

Speaker 9:          01:36:19       Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh.

Speaker 7:          01:36:24       That's an idea. That's what I do. That's what she does on. In all honesty, if you had a choice between living like a hermit, like all bullshit aside, no jokes, living like a hermit, living like someone who occasionally interacts with people but doesn't have any real deep connection with them or living like you're in like a wonderful community of people that you care about and drinking and carrying on. And hugging each other and laughing and joking around and waking up, hung over and getting breakfast together, and you live for a hundred

Speaker 4:          01:36:53       you want me to get an intellectual? Want you to know you're talking about that right now? You know the question. Now you know you're, you're, you know, you're, you know what this distinction you're drawing my friend. What can I get philosophical on you? The distinction between socrates and Nichi, socrates said, a man should have quiet contempt for his body and ultimately learn to be a complete template of human being. Just be a brain and your body is nothing. As he was dying, he drank the hemlock. He said, why are you guys crying? I'm living in a shitty shell and it's all gross and I'm going onto a better, I'm going to be in the sky with all the great philosophers and neat. She goes, yes, socrates. You said that because you are ugly, you never got laid. So of course you want to negate and you turn reason into a tyrant.

Speaker 4:          01:37:31       And he said, all those seven deadly sins of the Christians talk about like, like pride. There's another words, right? It's called self esteem. Self esteem is a good thing and lost. Yeah. Sex is a lot of fun. Even though he never had sex, but literally he never had basically never got laid. They even think, yeah, he might, they think he either got syphilis and that's why I died and went crazy. Or he was gay. Either way. He never got laid. He had a giant mustache. Bring up Nietzsche and take a look at his mustache. He's talking

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       about masks. He had a crazy mustache or code if if need. She was gay. Brilliant motherfucker. But he talked about there'll be able to make your life a circus and a work of art and joy, everything and live dangerously. Don't be fucking in a mountain when you're in a mountain meditating. It's awesome. But guess what? You're not really engaged in the world. I wish she was gay. Well, look at that because there's so many statutes. There's so many dudes that are like, like real aggro sort of Wall Street type guys that are pro Nietzsche. Yeah, it'd be awesome if Nietzsche was just like the whole time we was talking, hey, you're ugly. I'm thinking, well, good looking guys. Cox. Hopefully that's not the only conventional ways. This is the noise. I want you to think about him making behind the spectacles and with this beautiful mustache with a suit on.

Speaker 1:          01:38:38       He's doing this. As soon as they stopped the camera, thinking about Dick, don't get, you're being stereotypical. He's not licking his lips slurping. You don't know. Look at them, but look at that face I, that would be a Dick slurp and type face things whistle through his mustache when he says fuck, maybe that's why he has that mustache in the first place, so dude's can just really grab it and get all four fingers like this problem. Nippy late his lips, small discussion. Those are lip handles. He could grab a hold of them and wrap them handled Zinger and then use it to just like push down on the shaft. Lady. Man, I don't want to apologize. I want to pause. Check those unique. Why else would you grow mustache in your face? He was basically sick his whole life. He was sick and told like that many dicks.

Speaker 1:          01:39:27       You suck a lot of Dixie lose weight. I don't know if that's true. Cough a lot, sir. I don't know Dick Handle on his upper lip. A lot of girls have that. Why else would you grow a Dick Handle on your upper lip? Because he's hiding behind his mustache. Oh, so sensitive. What about a full beard? Like fucking animal? It's interesting. Some dude in special forces, it's kind of a neck handkerchief on those necker shifts. That was part of his, that was his scars. That was part of his, uh, special forces for mask. Why do so many of those don't look real? Badass ass guys have those crazy, uh, like things around their neck. Oh, uh, you mean? Um, eh, those ropes are how those uh, Bandana type thing. Do you want to know? They're like scarves. I gotta I have to answer why. Okay. Ready. Go ahead.

Speaker 1:          01:40:13       I know this from my buddy Rudy Raz, who was a recon guy and saw a lot of action. They did generation kill. So why do you wear those things? Why? Why do you wear a scarf? Here's why. Ready, Dude, I'm ready for this. And Hey, all you operators out there, please forgive me. I had never done any but just but just indulge me and all due respect as I'm, if I'm here and I'm shooting, okay, boop, up, up, up, and you're next to me. Where am I? Shells gone. They're fucking hot. They're spitting out. And when nutshell lands in your neck and gets under your shirt. It burns like a motherfucker and Avu buzzy. No. So you cover your neck. When you're in a firefight month, you cover your neck. Oh, so you were that you open mother fucker up getting Marchenko style. You're talking now you're [inaudible] burn marks all over your body. All over. I'm like little fucking rain. Teardrops rolling down your chest.

Speaker 1:          01:41:07       How about me? And I've got to stop. When I went to Afghanistan, when I went to do standup at Afghanistan, oh, I've got to say I wore one of those and the, and the special forces guy, we're in the truck, he goes, take that off. I go, why? Because if we hit with an IED or face is going to catch fire, her mother cotuit used to wear one of those and I was like [inaudible]. Yeah, that's a sign of what a bad motherfucker. Randy Cooke tourists. He thinks he's going to walk around with a scarf on. He's a ranger too, wasn't he? Wasn't he in the military is definitely in the army. He learned to box in the army, look at them things all over the place. He says shit about it to action. He could wear addition on his head and still he signs a new five scarf deal.

Speaker 1:          01:41:48       Oh, what years this scarf deal sounds like it's, it might be click on it and it real. He really, he's a handsome magazine. I guarantee this ain't a joke. What year is this? We use, this article's from January of this year. Oh really? Yeah. Oh that old. Less than a year. Do you remember? You and I, we were like 28 years old. Do you remember? You and I. When we first saw him, Joe and I first saw him, we were at the UFC and he was standing there and we were like, wait, let me snuck up. When we were looking at him and he had a big bond, his knee was like, he has a weird knee and then we like, his legs are skinny compared to his body. We were like assessing. We were taking him down. We were looking at his whole body, but we were like two teenage girls looking at a rock star.

Speaker 1:          01:42:28       I never forgot. That really is days, dude. You and I went to one of the earliest ever UFC is when I was like, dude, I can't work for these people anymore. I was like, what am I doing? It was like, it was just calm. Are you calling me saying you were going to announce it? UFC? I remember you saying, dude, get this. I was like, what? The fucking people that worked for news radio, like the production people really like what? I was like, yeah, I'm going to go to Alabama to do this UFC thing. It's a cage fighting. They looked at me like I was going to watch like animal porn. That's right. I was going to watch some chicks sucks and donkey, Dick's and bunch of dudes get fucked by mules and like that's like literally, I know. They were like, oh my God, you're ruining your life.

Speaker 1:          01:43:06       And I was like, I'm not gonna fight you. And I were asked. I remember that. Yeah, they have to figure out who's the best can I have to fight? I remember meeting or looking at Bustamante and you said, what's his first name or low morale boost Manta and he's just, he's six, four and he was at a food, there was like a food laid out and I and and you just, you were like, that guy's one of the best Jiu Jitsu guys in the world. And I looked at him, he had that jaw and I was just like, God, I remember go as Alan Gomes, I call this done fucking style pizza. That's me. 1997 adults it alibi. Lord, look at me a little pipsqueak beautiful young man. He was sweet, beautiful skin, or we used to train across my full head of hair. He sure does.

Speaker 1:          01:43:45       He's starting to go though. You sure do. My best to hang on. Yeah. Sharp, sharp. Your nose. Your nose is my had a sharp does banner called me up. I was the same way. I just, I did Artie Lang's radio show and rounded off as you get older. I had a sharp nose. Skinny fucking neck. Yeah. It's weird. Like I'm a thick guy now. When we first met, we were both skinny. We're both like a 27 maybe. I had breakfast with Brendan shop this morning and I came fresh, fresh, my Olympic lifting class, you know I Olympic lift now, right. And my testosterone. Look how, look at Hackett. You see if you get me and Brian Count together. When Brian was the pool boy. Dude. You know what's really sad about that picture? I thought I was kind of tough back then. You're always a sweet guy. No, but I mean, in my mind I was like, I'm a black belt in taekwondo.

Speaker 1:          01:44:38       I wrestled in high school. A sad story. I remember when we first met man, we immediately had so much in common. We started talking about martial arts. Like what? You didn't take one doe? What? You're a comedian. What? Yup. What happened to that check? What was her name? Well, when you said [inaudible] box and you do Jujitsu and you have to, cause you'd be in jail. Otherwise I went. All that guy speaks to my life. We're both retards. Both the pit bulls. There you go. There's Brian. Look at you. It's you fucking look at the dancing. Look at you. Look at that. I was doing pushups to where's her? Uh, she, what is her name again? Mary. Um, oh my God. I can't believe I'm forgetting her name. She's so, she's the most talented woman I've all fucking funny. I'll tell you that. She's incredible. Fuck's her name, man.

Speaker 1:          01:45:23       I really can't believe I'm forgetting Mary's name. Jamie. Find finding me so lucky. You like a baby. Look at you. How weird is that dude that this thing, someone captured time? I, this actually really happened with us. I know. We were actually there at us in 94 dixie westward to find out what her name is. Manoj feel disrespect Mary Mary, I'm so sorry. I'm, I'm, we're going to find it. I'm 50 and I'm senile. Oh my God. If you smoked weed, that's what it is. That's what it is. You bastard. Terracing myself. We're doing a wonderful job of entertaining people. She's incredible. She's one of them. She was, I was always in awe of her talent. She's an awesomely funny Mary masterson. No, but that's patriarchy. Son asked her woman, we have to smash the city. Park is here. Back. Last name, master woman. How can we get up masterson can even at masterman. Yeah. Masterman yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:46:23       Dammit. Eris Scheer. I'm so back to Mary. She was very funny. She's incredible. That was a great character. She had to I, she was one of those people that was so talented like I could, she write shit and, and she would figure out what was wrong with a sketch and I would be sewing all I did, but then she was a groundling forever. I didn't know. I was like, Oh, you've been doing this forever. Like I did. Never done scratch specific type of comedy. Yes. You know, it's very different doing sketches. Very. It's very different animal than doing

Speaker 7:          01:46:50       stand up. She, she was ridiculously funny. Yeah. It's weird form of comedy, you know those sketch little short things, writing them every week. You know, that's the craziest thing about Saturday night live. But yeah, like the Chappelle show and a lot of these other shows, they had time to develop these sketches and they weren't doing them all in front of a live audience like night live does. I have friends who've gotten Saturday night live and that is grueling schedule. They're up all night, man. Kind of an idea. It seems like, well at least coming from Phil Hartman's explanation of it, he said it was very like competitive. Oh yeah. The point where people got real hostile with each other. It's just, it was never like a relaxed, fun environment. Like, in fact when he first came from Saturday night live and came over to news radio, one of the things what he was like a little standoffish at first and then eventually he like realizes like, oh these people aren't competing with me, we're not competing.

Speaker 7:          01:47:43       Right. It took a while though really? But yeah, yeah, yeah. There was like an environment of snl that was like super like hyper competitive and Michael's wants it to be that way. You have to compete to get your sketch on and if you don't, you you go away. And so it's a very competitive atmosphere. You could see it and felt like fit. And Phil just relaxed after a while he relaxed and I'm like, no, no, no, we're not competing like you're Phil Hartman. I'm some fucking dude that nobody even knows. Yeah. Okay. And were both on a show together. Hey, what's up? Yeah. And he's like, Oh okay, okay, okay. And then he like, I got deeper and deeper to know him. You know, this is back in my non weed smoking days. Unfortunately. I wish I smoked weed cause he used to love to smoke weed and yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:48:21       He would, he would smoke weed after shows and wind down and play music and go to strip clubs and shit. He does impossibly funny. He was a really interesting guy. But you're not like any guy I've ever met. Like legitimately not like any guy I've ever met. Like he had an incredibly unique way of viewing opportunities and things. One of the things that happened is he didn't really make it until he was quite old, you know, in terms of grounding. Right. Or is the second city, I think it was brown. I think he was cracking city. He might've been groundling too. I think you might be right. But I know he was also an artist and he did peewee's playhouse. He did something with peewees play, uh, you know, pee wee herman or an artist like a painter. Yeah, no, he needs to make album covers and stuff.

Speaker 7:          01:48:59       Yeah. It was like a, like a legit graphic artist. Wow. Yeah. He's a fascinating guy. Like when we first did a news radio together, he just decided that he wanted to get his pilot's license, so every time I talked to him, homeboy and have his pilots book out and be going over his fucking pilots book and going like he was constantly have it on the set, like in between scenes. He would do a scene and they would open up as pilots book and just as obsessed with learning how to fly a plane. My Dad? Yeah, my father, my father was obsessed with that. He got his pilot's license. I never got it. I was like, I don't know why you care that much. Well, you know what it is, man. It's freedom. It's like, especially a guy, obviously I can say this now since his wife killed him, he had a bad relationship.

Speaker 7:          01:49:37       When you have a bad relationship, you just want to fly these kids too and I want to, I don't even know. I don't know. I don't know. Horrible store. That was a worst. I remember talking to you right after it. Again, this is another thing where it was a disassociative. It was a psych psych medicine. It was zoloft mixed with cocaine. Not saying that she wouldn't have done that without anything. Not saying that the drugs are responsible, but I'm saying it's, it's eerie. How many different violent episodes are connected to psych medication. God, yeah. We are fucking with the very way that your brain interfaces with reality. To think that that doesn't have consequences is absurd. It's absurd. It's absurd. And to think that you can sort of poo poo those consequences, like correlation is not causation. Okay, you're right, you're right. But have you done a study to find out what's what, or have you really dug into it?

Speaker 7:          01:50:31       Have you looked into these people? If you find out what they were like, is there a way to even back engineer their personality before you start adding drugs? Is there a wet, like, do you know what the difference between depression and psychotic madness's? I don't know. I'm not. And I think obviously the people like the guy, the vegas shooter, nobody knew, right? If nobody knew and he just did that. So there's a, there's a line that he can cross. Well, he's capable of doing that. You don't know what that line killed himself. Point is. We're not dealing with an exact science. Yeah. We're dealing with something that vary so widely. This for anyone has suggested dosages, depending on how you react to it. Only reason why people are saying it's fine cause they make money from it. That's it. They didn't make money from it.

Speaker 7:          01:51:11       They'd be like, well blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. How many people are being prescribed? What? Yeah, why? How did you try exercise? You didn't, okay, so you just took a pill. You're eating sugar all day and you just took a pill. Now everything's supposed to go check your hormones. Did you do, did you do anything other than that? Yeah. The thyroid medications. Try Meditation. Did you try exercise? Did you try jogging? I want you to try jogging for six months. It will give you the pills. Yeah, but can you, but then again, is that hypocritical? Shouldn't, if I think coach should be legal, should I shouldn't, I think that people should be able to take a pill.

Speaker 4:          01:51:41       Well, I think your, your objection to that is that there's an entire industry making lots of money and making claims about those psychotic drugs, those drugs, psychosomatic, whatever the word is, drugs that may be in many cases are not true. I'm sure that things like PROZAC and Zoloft have their place. I'm sure they work for some people. I know. In fact I have family members that really do well with Xanax. I do as well. And I know, I know it's just like weed is good for some people and other people can't function. I can't really function on marijuana talk a pretty good right now. Thank you. But I yes I am but, but for the most part, it depends on your chemistry in your body. But I think what you're objecting to is that there is people who get there, people are getting very, very wealthy. Certainly companies on, on, uh, claims that are not measurable and not always true.

Speaker 7:          01:52:35       There's that. Right. But there's also the same reason why I don't think a 900 year old dude should be able to fuck a 50 year old lady cause it thinks she's basically like a phobia. This is what I think. I think that people are goddamn vulnerable

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       and gullible and when you have these commercials where there's people walking down the street and art cartoon butterflies are flying around and they're all jolly and you're selling antidepressants and then you start listing off be explosive, anal bleeding, heart blown out of your fucking chest, like the alien movie, Your Dick Falls off, your feet go numb, you start reading off this thing while you're showing the same cheerful environment and crazy music. I think that alone shows you that there's a problem. Just those commercials alone, the fact that they exist, the way they're structured, the fact that they have to say all these horrific side effects for like a minute, two minutes of the commercial, it's a horrific side effect. A giant like if you have like legitimately have and what is commercial 30 seconds. It's entirely possible that 15 of those 30 seconds are going to be the consequences of you taking this drug while you're looking at cartoon bunny rabbits and week flying through the air and everybody's smiling and there's a bunch of whistles and fucking piano and it seems like everybody's having a grand old time.

Speaker 3:          01:53:52       Yeah. And they're talking about death and suicidal thoughts. It's psychotic episodes and come on. Do you want a really good insight into how big Pharma works? Read Ben Goldacre is but pig farmer, fucking bad farm. I think it's called just money. And it's the same thing as all of it. It's tribalism because if you could look at your team, your pharmaceutical team as being you against everybody else, you could figure out a way to sell fuck up drugs to people that you really shouldn't be selling it. I just have to say you want to make money cause we're doing this podcast that my entire act right now, my new hour is all about this and everybody who's seen me that knows that this is true. That's what I want to say this. Cause you're talking about teens and tribalism. The theme of my fucking next hour is, is exactly this, how we break up into teams.

Speaker 3:          01:54:40       So I just don't want anybody to think that my next hour has been influenced by this fucking podcast cause I love that you're thinking about the same thing. I am. I think a lot of people were thinking about this now because as we were running into this weird situation where we realized that, you know, our democracy is in some weird way, uh, being examined that's being fractured isn't happening. Sure. There's a lot, but it's been examined by people. Yeah. They're looking at it from all sorts of different angles in an unprecedented manner. Right. And we're looking at the influence that Russia might have had and all this Bernie Sanders was going to run in 2020. There's, there's so much going on right now that's this intense, incredibly high level that we're all sort of like caught up in this thing trying to figure out what's, what's going to happen next. Also, it's also we're having really trouble trouble knowing what to believe. Right? I mean, we don't know what to believe and what to believe in. I mean, is this a Bot? And, and what, what is twitter? I mean, if six people are saying you did something and that's it in the why, what, how true is this? And if the stories are all remarkably similar now some consistencies,

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       I he, Charlie rose, but what, what do we do? It's very interesting time because trans privacy privacy is dead yet we still don't really know what to believe. I mean, I, I'm getting information from six different sources. So who's actually telling me the truth about that person or that event? Um, that's the biggest. That's to me. And that was one of the biggest shit. And when you add that to click baiting as it gets real, it gets to be a real create cynicism and it creates paranoia and it creates the idea that I can't rely on any, the institutions I used to be able to rely, rely on. And there's also been an observed strategy of really, um, inflated headlines that get altered later. Yeah. You know, they say something completely ridiculous. It's not really represented by the facts. And then they tone it down when people complain, but they got all the initial hits.

Speaker 4:          01:56:36       That's when I first novus notice doing that. You can sway a vote by saint floating things anonymously and then by the time it comes out that it's bullshit. Well you, you've lost what's also dirty to name stuff after important values like the Patriot Act. Of course. Fuck. How do you vote against the Patriot and patriot? Patriot. Exactly. Like that's rude. Of course. That's rude. That's a root, dirty trick. Somebody should have pointed that out. Someone David from, they had any balls like there was on the Senate floor. David from editing and in a book called don't think of an elephant, I think it was called. What year was this? When did I read that? A long time ago. But he basically talks about how language, if you learn, if you learn how to manipulate language, it is very beneficial, man. You, you will. It's really interesting. I read a um, it's fun, interesting things about like our population.

Speaker 4:          01:57:26       Do you know that 80, I think it's 82% of Americans can't name one living scientist yet. If you ask 82% of Americans will say that politicians should be talking to scientists even though they don't, they can't name one living scientists like Neil degrasse Tyson or Stephen hawkings or Lawrence Krauss. At the same time, there is a deep, not only mistrust but also respect for science. In other words, hey, you politicians listen to the fucking size. If there's, if there's a weapon out there that can, if there's a technology that can reduce this all the dust, listen to those fucking guys. At the same time, I find it very interesting that science is still being questioned. Like there's real questions on the right about the science behind climate change. Did you see what happened recently and it was in Texas, the recent rash of earthquakes. I tweeted about it today directly connected to fracking. I'm sure 100% but it's also interesting is that both sides of the left and right. Speaking of tribalism, the left doesn't want to hear anything about the difference, the scientific difference between men and women. That would be an issue, especially when you start talking about trans women, but the difference between male and female brains because what happens if your James Dannemora is that what you're is

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       that women are a victim to their biology and ultimately are not able to overcome certain things that men have inherently. James [inaudible] from the Google knows. Yes. I just want to as the Google memo guy. Yeah and I read that Google and I'm about twice and what's interesting is a lot of evolutionary psychologists and biologists basically said, well what he was saying was just drawing on on empirical evidence based on how, for example, a 48 year old, a 48 month old infant female and a 48 month old male we'll look at too. If you give them a choice between looking at something moving and a human face, typically the female to 48 hour old female, we'll look at the face, the human face, the boy will look at the moving object. What about lesbians? I definitely kid is running out of the room like leather Tuscadero that's a different story with a Mohawk on the days that I don't [inaudible] haircut. Do you remember when Pinky Tuscadero came to town? There was out of town. Remember this?

Speaker 1:          01:59:45       Yeah, they did that thing when you got to learn it. How do you remember me that I don't remember that we're the same age. We had to learn it in high school. Who tested their out? They keep Tuscadero got to learn it and once you learn it, you only learn how to do it. One side of we 50 or what was that? Who was that show now? No, that's a new chick. Oh, that's her. That's what she looks like now. That's good. Wow. That's what she looked like. Leather Tuscadero hm. That's leather. Tuscadero and then there was pinky. Pinky. Pinky was like a little tougher. She wore like a pink leather jacket. She sure it did. She is there. She said she had her shirt like this high. That she was hot and like a dirty mom away. Damn right. She was fucking dancer. Ooh.

Speaker 1:          02:00:27       We could hurt with Fonzie. You want to talk about nicest guy in the planet. It might be Henry Winkler. I've met him. He's such a sweetie. He's a sweetie. He's a beautiful man. He's a really, really nice guy. I did it Kevin James movie with him. You did? Yeah. I could not have been nicer. You know, I was supposed to do. Kevin can wait. They offered me apart, but I was in New York and I couldn't do it cause I was, I was doing a one off your fucking excuses. Well, I'm glad to that cause I feel bad. I Miss Kevin. I would really love him. And he's a great guy. You talked to him lately. No, I haven't, but I love that car. I love and Leah revenues on that show, right? Yeah, she's back. She's a new wife. They damn, I don't know what happened. Scientology, when you mentioned Phil Hartman did some album covers.

Speaker 1:          02:01:04       I found this. Oh, Asia Dude. Have you heard? Have you heard Charles Manson Song? He did Asia Fuck Outta him. Steely Dan. What? Yeah, whatever. What else do you have eight album cover is designed by listening. Can Be America. Yeah, that's right. And POCO. Which fucking kitten now. He was awesome, man. Did you hear that? Wow. The firesign theater fighting clowns. Wow. Damn. I want to get a print of that. Go back to that, see if we could find a print of that fire sign theater. Fine. Yeah, I'll look it up, but yeah, let's get a print of that and put it up in the studio that did you hear Charles Manson's song to I hear about it. Jerked off to it. It's amazing, sir. Sarah, please. Sorry, five to ten five foot two Charlie. Matthew. Hi. You're your garbage man. He legally, I played him on Mad TV and me and that's why baby without the, what do we do?

Speaker 1:          02:02:03       You believe? What do you do is amazing that that guy got so many people to follow him, but that's a thing like 900 year old people would not fall. Charles Manson, man, I'm talking about the 900 year old people. That's a long way, but that's the whole reason why we are infants were just infants with a very short lifetime as quick. Let me ask you this. Imagine if people look like you ever look at a person from like the 18 hundreds when they first started inventing photographs. You see a 25 year old like, oh my God, he's almost dead. They look so old. They look so weathered. They looked like they were just dirt, had been he Gary Fisher when they would take pictures of with their dead relatives. Oh, you ever seen that? This is my kid. They all died. I have pictures. I'll take pictures with them.

Speaker 1:          02:02:43       Oh yeah, those people, they died quicker. They looked like shit. What if you lived 800 years? This is what I think about. I don't think about developing that much understanding. I feel like I'd be like, all right, well I guess I'll start the drums and then the guitar and then the piano and I'll master those as well. And I would just figure out all the skin skills I've master. Let me tell you what you would be at 80 or 800 years old. You'd be living in a castle and you would basically be having young ladies come to the council and give them seminars. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I enjoy. Well, older woman because your 800 they're going to look hot as fuck and they're still going to be like kind of spiritual but not really religious. Yup, I do that too. Why? I don't know why.

Speaker 1:          02:03:30       It's just top being awesome. The sex DAPI and awesome. I think that's a crock of shit designed by people don't want to fuck me too. Me Too. Me Too. When do you know can to look to look Dixon molds wound. It's going to be boring. Well, okay, maybe, but I don't see any evidence. I'm not seeing any evidence that that's real. I think you're making things up and I'm not really interested in talking to you about this, so I find your, your, your fucking opinions are exhausting and they boring, so you hang onto them. Your opinions are exhausting and they're boring. Yeah. So you hang onto them, you run with them, but I go, Nah, Nah, I'm good. The base living, here's the thing. It's like there's this idea that there's like some higher level of thinking and then there's like base physical pleasures that's not real. You have a hundred years and then you're dead. So you're supposed to have, if you're lucky, you've got a hundred beers. Just because you enjoy some very intellectual pursuits. It does not mean you should enjoy getting your drink on every now and then or doing something stupid, being silly or

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       sacks or anything. What would you say herself a friend, what would you say to yourself right now? If I put your 25 year old or your 20 year old body right there, what would you say to yourself right now? Figured out pitch. Really? That's what I'd say. Yeah. You got to figure it out. You gotta make your mistakes. You're you, what you're going to learn from someone. You're never going to learn from them sitting down saying, listen, you got to learn from me. Well, you're going to learn from someone as by example. We're going to learn for someone as by someone out there like following a lead that you know is difficult and achieving teams that you think are very hard to achieve and you watch that and you go, okay, well you got to do is you got to get comfortable with being uncomfortable.

Speaker 3:          02:05:12       You got to grit your teeth. You've got to bear down. You got to work hard. You gotta be honest. You can't go to be honest with yourself about how hard you're working. And that's what a lot of people are not doing. That's what you learned. You never know how to, how to slip a jab until you get punched in the face of much going to show you how to do it. But to really learn it to the point where it's a part of your normal patterns, there's certain things that happen to people where you, you see them like slide their hips back there. Oh, that's the guy who's been kicked in the stomach. Yes. Like he, he's been times where everything you do as a reaction, you don't have to think about it, but it gets you same thing for sure. Yeah, yeah. Those pathways get carved in and by the way, those pathways can be really shitty too.

Speaker 3:          02:05:50       You're going to have a bunch of shitty pathways carved into your head that ensure your failure. It didn't sure your failure, they didn't show you're, you're questioning yourself and also blaming a bunch of other people. You got to like, you know how like people are supposed to edit. You're supposed to edit. Like when you make a document he's supposed to edit. When you write a book, you should also add thoughts. You can't just let them all run wild. Right? You can't because some of them are really like impulsive and they're, they're not well fabricated. Right. And if you try to defend those fucking stupid thoughts, you're going to be like what we were talking about with conspiracies and you learn what not to listen to. That's the other thing. Not all, not all fucking ideas are on the same plane. There are a lot of people you shouldn't be listening to and if you want to be really good at something, find the right tutor.

Speaker 3:          02:06:33       There's big differences in how file Codero and you know, if you want to learn how to kickbox or whatever, and that dude over there, right? Yeah. Right, right. Yeah. If you can, well, yeah, if you have the, I mean, they'd be be a good, good guidance and tutelage is really important. It is. You know, it's interesting now is that people that don't have access to good guns and tutor, which still have access to online, say Thomas because you got, you got, you got the Gracie University, you've got, and you've got youtube, you've got Hansel, gracie giving you a little thing. I mean, could he, Bravo has this whole system, 10th planet Jiu Jitsu System. It's all available online. You can learn all the moves and if you're in a small town, Eddie has over a want to say go to 10th planet, Jiu jitsu.com 10 planet j j.com. I want to say he has more than 80 students, or excuse me, more than 80 studios worldwide.

Speaker 3:          02:07:18       Yeah, I think he has more than 80 schools, so, wow. And they put up a lot of the data of like the stuff they're doing and stuff. They're working on drills and things. A lot of it's online. Yeah. That's amazing. Yeah. How many, what does it say? Look at the fucking, that's incredible success. 10th Planet that the city says he's charging a lot of license, that he's making money. Trust me. We'll talk later. Look at this though. Look at this. This is, I mean, this is insane. That's amazing. He's, he's got a huge accomplishments. Z, a crazy number of people that follow his Jujitsu. He is right about his conspiracy theories, but he's definitely right about Jujitsu. You know the chemistry of things. Another one, like he, he claimed that for a long time. He still, he'll put something up on his instagram page. I know why he believes that because he doesn't believe in the government, but my position is I get that and I don't, I don't trust a lot of people either, but you have to trust the people that are scientists that are all agreeing that if a fucking jet engine that's heated up goes through condensation and a certain atmosphere that creates artificial cloud being responsive to evidence.

Speaker 3:          02:08:21       It is. And it's also like you, you, you can't, you can't mock that. Like it's very important if you're going to get anywhere with any of their stance on your wrist and in your hand, and you're going to have, when you're listening to it like this, this is their science, that measurable science that works, right? So the science that goes into your earphones that goes into the vaccines and antibiotics, I push you beyond your black biology, the science that gets food, fresh food in front of you. All that shit is, is you're benefiting from that. And usually the science that you don't believe in is the same science you're actually using to speak into. Well that's, yeah, that's the argument we were having yesterday that it's, it's so ridiculous that anybody would have an issue with the highest minds in the world deciding whether or not things are real and things are not real and what is and what isn't.

Speaker 3:          02:09:09       Well, he thinks that's really weird. I don't know what he believes we could sit him down and talk to them about it, but my point about all of it was that the very genius that allows him to like shut down Jujitsu attacks, like he doesn't recognize Jujitsu attacks. It's like, well this is valid too. No, he's like, shut that shit down and move forward. It's one of the reasons why he's so good at Jujitsu. He's so good at Jujitsu cause he doesn't like recognize your attack is valid. Gosh, shut shit down and it moves. It's really interesting as well because he's an undeniable, Eddie Bravo is an undeniable jujitsu genius. I haven't sound to die. I know. I've been salivary. Sure. Yeah, he's great salivary. I'm sorry, have some reason to shout out to Ivan. He, I went and he gave me a lesson and if so awesome.

Speaker 3:          02:09:54       It was fun. I went to Seattle and the school, you know, he's the only guy in the UFC that has a submission. I think maybe one of the person might have it now, but for the longest time he was the only guy that had a body triangle rear mount submission where he got a guide. He got Tony Fryklund in the, he got his back. And when you flatten somebody out and you have someone in a body triangle, yeah, it's so fucking brutally painful. Yeah. That um, Tony frequent tapped. He was the first guy ever to tap from a body triangle. And I remember I've watched him do that and I was like, oh wow. Cause I knew that that hurt, but I didn't know if someone would tap from it in a UFC fight as well. Whoa. For a guy like me, he's probably 43 44 now.

Speaker 3:          02:10:33       And he said he invited me to school. I was just so excited and he's going to teach me tricks and just like in close fighting, Bach, dirty boxing. And He, we put, he put vaseline on me. I was like, what's going on here? Yeah. See he gets a body triangle last cross. It's tap and fucking the pocock. He's awesome. It's so painful. He's such a great guy. Look at him. He's from Chile. Yeah, he's a bad motherfucker. And he's got a rooster tattooed on his wrist. He does it. And it was funny because he came to my show and then I, the next day I, I was, I got an a ring with him and he had, he put greets salmon and we're just doing little things with gloves. And when you, it's for a man like me, for a man like me who's basically 170 pounds and nothing come back.

Speaker 3:          02:11:13       And when you feel that a man who's been thrown bodies around his whole life and punching, and it's been his life and he's, oh, he's probably about to 20 maybe to 30 and he acts a little heavier than when he used to fight. But the strength and the, just the density of his body as you're fucking trying to do anything and he just moves you. He kind of shocks you around with a script writer. It's so humbling and he's super technical to Oh fuck. He so to Ivan was like super, super. That's it. Did I take a picture of him and was like, it was a picture of him and Maury Smith being held court and meet with Charlie Murphy. Charlie Murphy is explaining something called the Chicago Ridge hand. That's like a, a technique karate technique that people aren't using enough in mma. He's kind of right.

Speaker 3:          02:11:57       It's a rich hand is where you had hit someone with a side of your hand. Do you ever know rich hand? They were practicing karate move. You'll know about chet shot. I don't know shit. Karate move is a rich hand. It's like this. This is Eddie Murphy. That's Ivan salivary to the right of the table and the black bald headed dude is Maury Smith. Come on. Yup. You got two bad mother, two killers at the table and then I'm, I'm back behind this, all this stuff. I'm on this side of it, but uh, it was a charlie murphy explaining, I don't know shit about the Chicago look at his hand and so quotable Charlie was holding court. Charlie was so funny. Like I don't think people that never got to hang out with Charlie ever. Really good to understand how funny Charlie was. I heard is a great storyteller is amazing storyteller, but he just would hold court and you would let them, you would fall to the ground laughing.

Speaker 3:          02:12:44       He was just a great, he was great at like being the guy who told the story the best and it had the, but it didn't translate in a stand up as much as it should have been. This is what I think happened. I think he jumped into standup like way too quick. It was headlining like really early. Like he didn't do like the whole thing like we all did like do the open mic night and then start doing no dude, he was headlining like that. He was charlie my from the Chappelle show him done standard before that he had never done standup, can't do it. So he figured out how to weight it. I mean, he did it and he figured out, but I don't think he ever, I think if you had allowed Charlie Murphy develop the way we all did. Yes. From Open Miker to Middle Act, a headliner to holt, he would have been a world class assassin.

Speaker 1:          02:13:33       And he know he died. It's still a very funny comedian and he was headlining all over the world. Did you know he was sick when you were hanging up? No, he was in sick when I was hanging out with leukemia or some kind of a stretch. But that all happened after, um, after I'd seen him, I hadn't seen him in a while. He did my podcast in like 2000, I want to say in 12, somewhere around there, maybe 13. Um, him and my friend freeze love. Did you ever meet Eddie Murphy? Yeah. Met Eddie and uh, Hawaii once, just randomly. It was funny. It was the craziest thing ever. Really. It's like he knows who I am with. This is so cool, dude. He goes, you're a funny motherfucker. What the fuck happened? He reached down and grabbed my hand. He gripped it. Bobby funny mother Fabi had, who's married to Whitney Houston.

Speaker 1:          02:14:19       Bobby Brown came up to me the other day and the comedy store and told me some crazy. Bobby Brown came up to me. I was, I was getting my ticket and I was flying. I was flying from, I can't remember where. And he came up and he goes, you're funny dude, man, you make me laugh a lot and you're shaking my head. I didn't realize who it was until somebody came up and said, you know, that was right. I go, I don't, and he goes, that was Bobby Brown. I go, fuck that. He looked familiar and then we sat. I sat next to him singing the songs to him and everyone else to have bad tech camp. Did you know he was the first dude to Dirac the microphone on the side of his face. Really headset son who had a headset for Bob. You're fucking Brian. And he was dancing.

Speaker 1:          02:15:01       Who the fuck had a headset before Bobby Brown. He was like pushing the technology. Yep. Right. And then Christopher Titus started doing it on stage, but healy and I said, hell no, no. Titus does it still. I think he has like a little microphone. Hmm? Does the whole thing walks and talks like this? Have you? You've done like letterman. There he is. Look at him Brown. A couple of full on headsets on. I mean if you sit, realize how rich he was because he's still super rich. Must be, oh what am I as accountant? Look at that picture of him with the headset on. They'll go, dude, this is like a guy. If you were trying to get your Imac fixed and you had to call India to please look at please let ain't got it. I'm mad right there. You kidding me with that tank top you tank, you tuck that tank top on and you guess that you get the jacket off your shoulders a little big.

Speaker 1:          02:15:49       By the way, that's what it's a gay porn. If I ever seen in worries and look at those offering wristbands, why else did you have wrist wristbands on it? Unless you were there to stop hands. Don't get all sweaty when you know when you have lube all over your hands, it doesn't get into your elbows. Damn right. Damn right. Damn right. Can't have blue double hell, but I'm so proud. Don't be mad. We're just joking around. I'm a big fan. I'm a big fan. My prerogative bitch. He's awesome. Right? That was a great fucking song. He had some amazing shit. It's about motherfucker, but that does look, yeah, the way I like, but not like when anybody, anybody recognizes me. I love it. So not to do anything wrong with it. I'm not a cool celebrity. I'm not a, come on buddy, I'm tardy saying this.

Speaker 1:          02:16:27       You're hurting my feelings. What? You're cool celebrity. Thanks buddy. If I wasn't friends with you, I'd be psyched to be friends with you. I care attitude.

Yeah, the party continue else's there. Kristalina me, you shop, shop and someone else. Someone else. Really funny to know. Quite a few. It's like a good lineup. That's a, it's the same Tripoli show comedy castle. Excellent. Yeah, he's got a, he's got a very good line up.

Speaker 1:          02:18:02       I think one or two other comedians on that show. Russell Peters in the house. My main man. Someone else. Oh Shit. Please face coming. He's amazing. He's hilarious. Those are the other two are those really good lineup right there. Great God damn lineup. I think the stitches for your sides. You Eleanor, Eleanor Kerrigan. Ah, very funny. I love Alan Moore is one of the funniest people alive and used to be a waitress. She was a waitress at the comedy store for years and she was the girl that I would go to when they would tell me someone to tell me that this guy is really funny. I'd go, eleanor, is that guy really funny? She'd go, fucking hack. Eleanor is a wonderful human being and reminds me of the women in my family, so I have a very soft spot for her because she's Italian, I think is a softball.

Speaker 1:          02:18:46       I don't know if she has time, but by the way, I love her. Oh, that's beautiful. I love her too. She's Irish names Kerrigan. It's true. Actually she's married. Isn't it her married name though? No, I feel like she's telling it. Okay. Nope, that's it. Eleanor Kerrigan starting. She's from the, she's from the Italian side of our, what? This is not real. You don't know how real the eleanor is an Italian man. Nobody appreciates Dama rare. More than the Irish dominant. I said one time we were talking to this man depth, we're talking to this young, very pretty girls at the upstairs in the laugh factory and he's taking a piss next to dove. And he goes, oh, those, uh, those girls good looking. And Doug goes, yeah, you couldn't tell. And he goes, I have no, I mean, at that age, you know, when they're that young, they gotta have a goat head.

Speaker 1:          02:19:29       I'm still attracted to dom. Irrera is a god that's still swinging. Like, you know, like we all have this idea that a certain comedian age, like when you get into your sixties you're not going to write new material anymore. He's always writing and killing. He's always killing and he's killing it. He sits next to you. He'll pull over and sit next to you and go, oh, look at you queers like this. Just find a way to automate things. But what it tells me, it goes on and she goes, I did a set really well whenever he goes, bro, Bro, come over. I was like, oh, this is what, I didn't know him that well. I go, what? What? What's up done? He goes, you know what I like about you as a comedian? I was like, what so exciting is you don't really go for the laughs.

Speaker 1:          02:20:14       I was like, fuck. That's where he lives. He lives in the joking with other comedians. It's like dom, my rare, in my opinion, is the best guest ever on killed Tony. It was seeing him until to now. I'm sure he's great. He's magical. He's magical. Like I've done it with him. He's magical cause he's still professionally funny. He's so professional. He funny. But also there's a bunch of comedians that he's making laugh. Like that's what Dama rocks like best at. So it's, you know, me and him and red band and a Tony and then the comedian who does the sat and then the audience who are comedy nerds. So it's like dom irrera. It's just coming in there fucking with six guns loaded. Yup. Yup. Yeah. That's his, his, he's like, I just got an arsenal. Yeah. If I, if I was Tony Hinchcliffe, I would fire everybody else.

Speaker 1:          02:20:58       And I would say the talk show is dom irrera is there. And then another guest, like it's always dom irrera have him on the fighter and the kid, I don't, we haven't had him. Never on time. No long time ago. He couldn't make it. I can't remember what it was. I got to get them on. I fucking love them. Who's your least favorite guest? Awesome fighter. And the kid on the fighter and the kid. Yeah. My least favorite guests. Don't tell me, let's just keep this shit. I don't even, I can't remember. If you ask someone a question, you hope they don't answer this one. Will some people just kind of like, just don't come to play. Oh like they don't know what they're doing. They just don't come that they might have be having an off day. If I don't pay right now, I'm going to die.

Speaker 1:          02:21:32       How do you not have to pay? God, you're impressive. Huge bladder. Go ahead and do my huge deck and I'll be right back. Jamie and I'll talk about Lebron James. All right. Don't tell me. Tell me things. Jamie, is there a new sneaker? He does have a new seeker out. Well, did they have one every season yet? He's got two different pairs. He also has his own imprint label on Nike, which is a, that's a ball or may he sponsors Ohio state. That's like conor mcgregor starts cope promoting with the UFC like it takes it to the next level. Right. Did you hear anything about conner yesterday? Don't know if it's rumors or not. Well, he got into a fight and in a pub or something and I know terrible random shit about, I don't know if it was even accurate. That's the problem with keeping it real. Yeah. You know, if you want to keep it real and hanging with the people, eventually someone's going to test you. Someone like you were when you were 20 you know, maybe. Sure. I Dunno if conner was into that. I assume he wasn't because he's a winner,

Speaker 7:          02:22:26       but man, that absolutely can happen if you want to be out there. Again, Hashtag keep it real balling to, yeah, Hashtag balling. I mean he's, he's walking around with expensive watches, these beautiful David August suits on. He wears, he's tailored suits everywhere. Here's the super expensive shoes and watches and many of their lambos are driving around Ireland to a lot. That's great point. No, that's a good point. That's a good point. Yeah. He's balling out of control. I wonder what it would take him. I mean now that he had that big crazy fight at the fight and when he jumped over the fence and pushed referee Mark Goddard, I wonder what it would take to get him back in the cage now. Like one of it's going to be fines and suspensions. I wonder what the fuck is going to happen. It's quite fascinating, but I'll tell you one thing.

Speaker 7:          02:23:12       He makes things fun. He does. It makes things fun. With Oscar de la Hoya is hitting the heavy bag on. He should say that he'll fight Oscar de la Hoya, but only if Oscar agrees to wear a skirt. You got to wear a skirt and you've got to wear fishnet stockings and I'll fucking fight. You think there's anything still too. I've heard Roy Jones is still trying to fight Silva, which I don't know. Is there any kind of, not that it's going to happen, but the undersigned does not take that bait. Yeah, you have. Roy Jones is, I mean, you see what happened when floyd fought connor and connor is in his prime. You know, and I'm not saying that Roy Johnson his prime, but he's still very active. He still fights. Roy works out all the time and he knocked out some uh, amateur boxer MMA fighter last year. He had some, some fight. Remember that like there was like a contest to see who gets to fight him. Yeah. He Kao that guy with one punch a dinners and get suspended for his, uh, yeah. Yeah. Anderson's going to be suspended for quite a while. Oh really? Yeah. Once, if, if he indeed is guilty. Let me just preface that. If he indeed is guilty and uh, they, they don't have any reason to believe he's not. What's your, um, what do you think is the move for conor mcgregor? Sure.

Speaker 1:          02:24:18       The fight Manny Pacquiao or tiny tube made of gold can feel it with diamonds. Haband trash. Wow. Oh, till I get tired of doing it every day. Crap. Image oxide. We fucking drank and had we, during constraint the Tardis whiskey, I drink a fucking gun barrel full of Viagra, gone barrel, make my way to the pool and just started shooting rounds off. That's not a bad or good, it's not a good time,

Speaker 7:          02:24:49       uh, iconic mcgregor accent. But is it good or lucky charms? I would hire the most beautiful, huge volleyball player, women to just carry me everywhere. Hmm. Yeah. Just to get giant super athlete women and just carry you everywhere. Do you think he fights Tony Ferguson or does he fight? That's the Moon Manny Pacquiao. He used to be, not the move, but I think Tony Ferguson, like I think Eddie Bravo had a real good point about it when he and me and Brendan talked about it. I think Tony Ferguson, uh, is the right move as far as for the fans. I think, uh, over many. Yeah. I don't think that's smart. I think if he wants to do a, um, a boxing match,

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       the real smart move, be fun an mma fight and then fight a boxing match in a year. Uh, but I think that, um, uh, the Habib Nambucca madoff fight, you've really got to see he'll be fight somebody else first and the nate diaz fight, although it could be huge. Nate's not really fighting anybody right now. I would, what I would like right now, this is my thought, I think nate, if nate comes back at fight, someone who wins conor fight someone and wins. Connor is a boxing match. They have a huge mma fight after that fucking huge, goddammit. I mean 3 million pay per view buys huge, gigantic. He's got a ton of conor mcgregor. Yes. That's the fight. It's going to get through it. Yeah, but that's a big fight. He might not even have to get through that if he can lose but lose in a respectable manner, like lose a very close five round decision where it's like a nail biter where at the end of the rank and, Ooh, and then Tony Ferguson drops the ground and was like fuck.

Speaker 3:          02:26:20       And then there's like controversy. I thought conor won and the people that the pundents we'll debate it online if he can lose a fight like that. Yes. But if Tony Lights him up, crack some darce choke some puts them out in the first round and then spits on his dick. Yeah. Yeah. Then the nate diaz fight isn't worth a lot. But yeah, if he can do that, he's like, he's so loved by Ireland that he could almost do anything. You know, like Daniel Cormier, you said this to me, we were at a fight. It was in between while we're doing the standup thing where like, you know, they set you up at the microphones and you give your analysis about the upcoming main event, that kind of Shit. And we're looking at each other and he goes, he doesn't lose anything when he loses. He goes, that's what's crazy.

Speaker 3:          02:27:00       Yeah. He goes, he loses a fight and the support is exactly where it is, if not more. That's right. He's like, yeah, I'd never seen anything like it. They applied as courage. He's just so brave. Like he just puts on the line. There's definitely that. There's definitely, except what he says is definitely that crazy. The fact that he came back and beat Ne, cause I said that Brendan, after I saw him lose a person that I go, nate's just too big for him. Big came back, beat him. Yeah. And then and then and then knocks out in the first round. Knockout Eddie Alvarez second. The second rounds aren't lit him up. Sorry. Unbelievable. Like I was like, what was the second round? Wasn't it? I want to say a second round. I want to say made it to the, I want to say they were coaching them.

Speaker 3:          02:27:39       It's fascinating man. It's like to see him kind of back it up. That's what they applaud. Just his courage and his spirit. It's also, he's, he's a great shit talker. Yes. That's a big part of this. He's fun to listen to. Great dresses. Look at the way you dress to doing second round. Yeah. Khabib needs to fight at one 70 there. I said, well you say that, but he's got a new nutritionist and Corina was telling me that he's having a way less problems with his weight now. He's 25 no, no, no. He's not eating. Okay. No, that he's in the one seven he's now. Really? Yeah. Yeah. That he's like way lighter now than he's ever been. Any time close to a fight and that he'll have way less problem making weight for this fight and they've got them on a very strict nutrition schedule now because he's fighting his team. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:28:22       My coworker Tammy, for me, I tells me I'm sure much rockhold luke walks around at two 15 you know, I've listened to him. It doesn't make near megabit off bigger. You understand how that works, right? Right. No, it never like he looks at Luke posted a picture of him training with Khabib and I was like, who's the giant? And it was done. Like he's one of the most impressive grapplers I've ever seen in MMA. Yeah. It's ability to take guys who are very good, you know, like Javiel dos Anjos and just sorta ragdoll of wow. He's his wrestling is. It is. It is. It's, it's stunning. It's a different kind of Russ because I think dos Anjos is better now than he was during that fight, but it doesn't matter. It's like, well, the way he did it to him, it's like, man, if there's levels where it's hard to tell with them, it may because strikings and fault when strikings involved the, you don't get to see the pure grappling level.

Speaker 7:          02:29:15       But what I was seeing when I was seeing just pure, just pure grappling, I would see in strength endurance technique there. It was just like 30% like they're stacked up on number grammatical. She gets a hold of you. Yeah. You're not getting him off. He got Mowgli Javery yeah. Nobody gets him off. Look at the size of it could be a breath. Yeah. But now I might be the camera angled, but it could be, but he's, you know, he's in front and, but he's, you know, he's not cutting weight right there or he's, if he is, he's, you know, halfway into the game. Yeah. He's a monster man. He does. I think he does really well at 72 that's what I'm saying. He posted something on his instagram. This is a show you, why motherfuckers so hard and why all those people from Dagestan so hard.

Speaker 7:          02:29:54       He posted something on his instagram, one of his friends who had been tortured, no posted photos of his friend who had his stomach cut open. Yeah. He put posted on his, in his, uh, instagram. This, this guy, there's two photos, there's this photo and then there's the next one. And this guy had his stomach cut open. They were tortured him about something. And there's a translation, you can translate all of it, but it has something you, him saying that someone was wrongly accused, they were trying to get him to confess. But the point is this is a UFC number one contender, or at least number two in the lightweight division, one of the most towns fact divisions in the world. And he's posting stuff on his page about how hard his environment is that people are being tortured. Yeah. He's, when he gets in there, his mind, I mean you're, you're fighting, literally fighting.

Speaker 7:          02:30:38       He calls himself the Eagle. He's like a fucking eagle. Yes. I mean he's fucking for Roche's when he gets in there and he's at a level of grappling, like, man, he's been doing it his whole like crazy. And at an intense super primal level, you know, so intense, real technical, super knowledgeable about wrestling and Jujitsu and submissions. I think Daniel said that they liked, they basically tussled for 15 minutes. Damn Daniel the Olympian. Yeah, he said it was hand fighting with them. He like Whoa Shit. It's like he's a beast, never coming off as a beast. And when you see him get a guy like Michael Johnson down in the ground and just own him, he owned and he was saying, look, I'm sorry I gotta do this to you man, but you gotta tap

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       like, um, I need my title shot. Nobody saying guys beating the fuck out of him, man. He was just holding him down and pounding on him. Yeah, it was really hard for me to watch cause one thing I'm like, I'm impressed with Michael Johnson's complete unwillingness to tap just, he just like beat me up, keep beating me up cause we're fighting through it. And then he eventually got Kimora but it was just ruthless man. Yeah, it was ruthless and the control that he had on him, just his arm tied up and just beating the shit out of all. I was like, wow, this guys, there's, there's certain positions where you see a guy so much better at a god that he's not done and then a guy that, the guy who's holding down just not going to get up. It's not going to get up. So matter of time before he gets beaten into unconsciousness, right.

Speaker 3:          02:32:00       Jacques are raised the same way and when [inaudible] gets on top of you or get you down, you, you know, unless you're a little Yoel Romero your, we'll see you later. Yeah. See how he's got his right arm tied up. He just clamps down on his wrist and his right arm became, he became a one arm defensive guys. Just the guys been fighting and his whole like wrestling his whole life. So fine details. It's fucking details though. It's where his hips are. It's all the minutia, the micro movements that any, any ways. He probably feels like he weighs 300 pounds. I'm sure like those wrestlers like that, like, you know, the, the, when you, when you tussle with a guy who's been doing it his whole life, he can make him, he can, he can tap you. If you're a regular guy by putting his weight on you.

Speaker 3:          02:32:38       After a while, you'll just, you'll just tap and which ben her and it's going to be on the podcast. Oh, I'm working it out with Ben astron going to get them out here. Finally, I've been a ben ask a ball rider the killer for several years. Not Technically a Dick Rider Paul rider or have a ball. Right? The Dick is so deep in it. Now you're riding his girls over there. I write, I hold on the balls. I look up at the day. How much does he weigh? Well, what is he fights at one 70. Uh, okay, so he's one seven athletic. If I was 30, 50 or something, cuts some weight for sure, but I don't think he cuts a lot of weight. I mean, it's not one of the bigger guys in the division and he's just super technical. This wrestling. He was his, uh, where do you learn?

Speaker 3:          02:33:16       Well, he is a fucking serious world class amateur wrestler. I mean, do you know? Yeah. Before I thought he was just Jujitsu tits. No. Ben Asker and pull up Ben aspirins record. You could see his collegic wrestling record. He was a fucking monster at that hair. Powerful Missouri. Look at that. Uh, if you, uh, pull up his record, those wikipedia record and he does a lot of work with a lot of Duke roufus. This guy's too. Yeah. Um, he's has always been a corner man. I've always seen him at the UFC. He's, yeah, he just had, he had some sort of an issue with the post Olympic career. So like what is the Olympic Games? He was in Beijing. Well, what did he win in the Olympics? He lost one. Any one one. Is that what it says? Wow. You know, phenomenal wrestler. I mean, just phenomenal. And he's retiring undefeated as a mixed martial artist. He just a, I think he just beat Aoki. I think that was his main, his a retirement fight. Wow. One on another contest

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       after the Olympics. To Dave Schultz Memorial International. He Won. MMM, probably, yeah, probably over middle or defeated a silver medalist in another tournaments. Interesting. Um, go to his MMA career because I want to see who he just beat for his retirement fight cause he just had, it was retirement fight. Yeah. Shinya Aoki who at one point in time was one of the most, uh, exciting submission guys in the world. And he was right. Uh, did she tapped out by Nick Diaz? He used to wear tights. That's what I'm still fighting though. You seen that was recent? Yeah. Aoki just fought Ben Aspirin. I didn't know basketball was still fighting. Yeah, this was his retirement fight. He just had like, just had it like last week. Wow. Yeah. I sent him a congratulations and I said, let's do a podcast. He had a twin brother or am I thinking of Matt Hughes?

Speaker 1:          02:35:04       You're thinking of Matt Hughes. Are you sure to have a twin brother too? Might as well. I don't know. And, and but uh, let me ask you, this. Does, why was Matt Hughes Doing, do you know? He's doing better? Apparently they're really excited about his progress. You know, he was in a coma for quite a while from the, apparently what they're saying is that he thought that he could make it across the tracks and then if you waited, the train takes like 10 minutes to go or tearing or attendance, fucking giant ass train. So he took a chance and he hit some gravel and he was able to sell. I worked with them on warrior and you know what he said to me? Well he goes, I just hope I can put my shoes on, put my own shoes. I when I'm 70, I can like he cause he, he worked, we were talking about head, head trauma.

Speaker 1:          02:35:42       He worries about it. He says about all should he should, you know, and towards the end of his career he developed a, um, a compromise chin. It's the best way to put it. Like you could see like everybody, j pen, brain shut down. Does everybody, does chuck the Dal who had the, probably one of the greatest chins of all time, he exhibited it later in his career. He just couldn't take shots anymore because your body goes, oh, I've been here before. I see a letter and shuts down. Yup. It makes sense. A guy who is just rock solid for Rosha says Chuck Liddell, he just a walkthrough bombs. Guys are just throw bombs on him. He'd walk through them at the end of his career, he could not do that anymore. So interesting. How your, how a lactone of fighting makes you more fragile, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:36:23       Yeah. I mean your body's just not designed for that. He did an x ray of his face and he has a micro fractures all through his face and he said, and the doctor said it's very common with fighters and football players choose corona. Just micro just cracks all through your math. Oh my God. Of course. Yeah. You think about Brendan Spar and Shane car when all the times getting mugged. How about getting punched full on and having his nose shattered by Cro cop? It was an elbow, in fact. Yeah. And still coming back. Lamb. Yeah. Took shots. Took some good shots from a big country before he got hit behind the ear. He watched that fight. Well, boom. Ben Rothwell caled him Big Ben. He's another guy. Like what happened with him? He got caught with something, right? Yeah, man. Ask him, does not have a twin brother. I know. He's got a brother. Oh, there it is. There you go. That's her brothers. I think

Speaker 7:          02:37:16       one of the things that, um, I mean when you're talking about in these, the fucking athletes that we're dealing with today, you know, he talking with like what they're experiencing. I think with medical science, I bet like in 50 60 years we're going to be looking back and they're going to be going, God damn, man, these people couldn't even take blah, blah, blah to fix their problem. They couldn't even go to the blah, blah, blah machine to fix their brain and they just had to have bad brains. Right?

Speaker 4:          02:37:43       Remember what Robert Sapolsky said in your podcast last time? He said, I thought it was amazing. He says, we learn more. What do you think's going to happen? He said, I think in like 20, 30, 40 years, we're going to go, my God, look at the way we treated people who killed and who did things that were impulsive. They, their brains were just fucked up and we didn't know how to fix him well,

Speaker 7:          02:38:01       just that he, um, he was not just talking about their brains being fucked up. He was saying that the idea of free will is a ridiculous concept that's ingrained in the psyche of the American people in particular. And that's a Christian idea. Yeah. But it's also that you as a scientist, the way he looks at things, I mean, he's boiling things down to the fucking, the, the very atomic level. And he's essentially saying that your behavior has been determined by your environment, by your genes, by year. The experiences that you've had by all of this,

Speaker 4:          02:38:31       things that you've left frontal cortex may not be as developed because you grew up poor and under a lot of stress. So you make impulsive decisions, lack of nutrition. They got the guy who kidnapped bent girl I was talking about. The young girl had two kids with her when she was 13 years. His father said that he had a motor cycle accident. He was a normal kid, and then he had a motorcycle accident. He was never the same. He, his whole personality, just the kinison story, the kit and got hit by a truck. Oh Wow. Kinison was one kid, Sam kinison got hit by a truck and then he's like, wow, wow, wow. That gut kicking over. If you know what else changed your personality, they say sometimes, which is fascinating. Jerking off in your own mouth, almost almost. That would be traumatic. Changes your personality. It would be traumatic for a little bit. It does a little until you end up liking it. But here's what really changes. You're having a heart, uh, operation. Oh, that makes sense. Now what was so weird though, we'll see for an operation on your heart and it changes your whole personality.

Speaker 7:          02:39:28       Well, there's one thing about that that Dr. Mark Gordon, you know, Mark Gordon, he actually did a paper on um, post traumatic surgeries like open heart surgeries and the effect it has on depression and perhaps suppression of your body's ability to produce hormones. There's something about being under anesthesia for long periods of time with very complicated operations. It leaves people uniquely depressed afterwards. Wow. Yeah. And he was, he was telling me about this after the whole Robin Williams, things happen because Robin Williams got sick, he got a heart condition, he had heart surgery, and then he eventually one of committing suicide. And he's like, I'm not saying it's the core, it's the reason Robin Williams

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       did that, but there is absolutely some connection between this compromised hormonal system and depression and between a compromised hormonal system and long operations while under anesthesia. And I was like, wow. Have you had a lot of guys on about the Gut biome? Oh yeah. And how that affects your mood from having people on, from having Chris Kresser on the last time he was on, I changed, I'm eating like four cans of Kimchi a week. Oh really big ass cans, man. I mean fermented cabbage and of course cause you're an extremist. Do you have to eat that much? I know, but listen to me. Look at me right now. Who are you the just because fucking Kim, she's good for you. Doesn't mean you have to eat that much proud. All the, you're the, you're the extreme. Can you have a little bit like the way the Koreans do feel pretty good. I know, but why the fuck he get his weapon? He gets bay a piece of information and he'll just eat bowls of Kimchi. Yeah, I played this video game. Fainted. I fainted. I never do that. But I have bone broth and Kim, she of course you do. Of course you do. And I put Habanero sauce in the bone broth. A surprise. I sweat beads of sweat coming off my bald head. His pouring down of course. And I'm eating Spicy Kimchi and I'm drinking spicy bonus. Did you need stream? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:41:29       Well want to live forever? No, no, no. And he's in love with mortality. I told you I any mortality fuck out until the lights go off. This mother fucker is going good. I'm going to be dead. So this engine is perin. I'm corner in, everything's listen man. If you don't think, if you think I didn't have a long conversation with Mister Justin Ds, who is Phil Heath's trainer was and he's a Mister Olympia guy. He like trains all those guys. I talked to him for a lot. I cut to the chase. I go phil, Justin, Knoxville, Justin days. I go justin right now, Ken and my Sean Salt like I go and his, his, his beautiful wife, heather ds is number four in the Olympia. She and I will kill you. She looks amazing. And I went, I went, hey bro, let's cut to the chase. You know everything about nutrition and everything about weightlifting.

Speaker 1:          02:42:14       There's no doubt about how to build muscle. He's a fucking genius. Talk to him about trt cause I'm 50 and it's getting to a point where I'm going to have to start shooting myself up. What? He said, we had a long talk. Don't worry about it. The point is, I'll be seeing the doctor for the sound. Look, if you guys see me, really want to start? No. Uh, she'd say no, you don't mention it. I'm not afraid. Not Afraid. You don't have that stuff. First of all, she's got a girl for a boyfriend or other excuse. She's got a husband. Yes. I wouldn't even talk about giant man. He's a, he's a very thick rabbet. All right. Sorry. Sorry man. Jamie's pulling up pictures of her. Hey Bro. I wasn't looking. I was just looking at her back, her back. I'm looking at the basket. Someone else by slaves doesn't mean you have to. You son of a bitch, son of a bitch, probably into orchids to [inaudible] is the real problem with the social justice warrior movement as they eat their own to try to take away any sort of blame on themselves. I just think the left, the liberal left is not, that is lost. Their sense of

Speaker 3:          02:43:11       humor. You can't even be funny. You can't say anything. I predict that this is the inevitable demise of a vast majority of the colleges in this country and the people are eventually going to learn how to form communities and learn online. Why Jonathan? You know Jonathan Heit these creating the Heterodox Academy, you know about this? No. So John [inaudible] is a fucking giant. Jonathan Heit, I can't believe you haven't had much podcast. He's a giant. He wrote the happiness hypothesis. Lily fit in this room. Ah Yes. He, his brain might not though. And he basically is a Columbia University and he was like this place you got fucking students that can report you blindly and then you get called up in front of a whatever and he [inaudible] appropriation of all, it's 17 to one, usually like 1717 to hardcore liberal sort of leftists and one conservative to ever do these colleges like Brown and Columbia.

Speaker 3:          02:44:04       And he's, he said this is orthodox thinking. It's so bad that they've created safe spaces where you're not even allowed to hear the other side cause it might be violent too much. So he said, I'm creating the Jonathan Heit, h a. I. D. T. You have to have my various, he's a fucking, he's a genius and he's awesome in every way and he's so important as a thinker, he's been, he's one of the more influential thinkers in the past 30 years. Really? Yes. Basically proving that intuition and that your, your feelings control so much of your thinking. He's a fucking genius social scientist. Anyway, that's my shout out to Jonathan. Hi, I'm glad I had a chance to talk about them, but powerful shout out to Jonathan Heit. Yeah, but he created the Heterodox Academy. He's like, this orthodox thinking is fucking, you know, is not good for anybody. What we talked about earlier, it's people being tribal idea sex.

Speaker 3:          02:44:59       We need idea sex. Do you remember that thing at University of Missouri Without Mama and that guy was an Asian young student photographer and this woman came over and she was yelling at him to stop taking photographs because they had created a safe space. And then she said, can I get some muscle over here to take this photographer out? He's like, this is like the first amendment. Wow. He's like, I need freedom of speech. Freedom of the press. I was taking photographs like there's an event that's happening on public property here. Like what do you, I'm a part of the school. I'm being hired to do this because she's so, she comes over and totalizing them. She is, she's a woman. She's contacting them. She's not even a child. I mean that's her child. She is a professor in training or something like that. Anybody who disagrees, anybody comes to grace? Look at her. She looks like a fanatic. You're need to get out. I actually don't.

Speaker 10:         02:45:47       All right.

Speaker 3:          02:45:54       Wow. So crazy. She's not very smart. Well, she got caught up in the moment. You know what I mean? That's really what it is. More than anything. She probably thought she could get away with doing that. She didn't realize how crazy it would seem on camera saying, I've got some I want, I need to get some muscle over here. She her up. So she's

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       chill. She's thinking the same way. Those that are intolerant I thinking, right. She's same methodology or brain works the same way you're, you're in the way. I'm going to get you out of the way. Well, Isis goes, you're not a believer. No point in trying to convert you. I'm going to shoot your, cut your head off because it's the same one mentality. You were totally right. You're totally right. Same methodology. Yeah. And it's also like she's in a heightened state, right? She's in the combat state. She's immediately argumentative. The guy's got a camera on her because you got anybody, anybody who disagrees where there's region evil and false. The enemy. Why racist, sexist, homophobic. And when you said when you hit somebody with racism and you go, you're a racist or sexist, what you do is you shut down the whole debate because you just, you just labeled as very complex human being with all kinds of emotions.

Speaker 1:          02:46:52       Right? Who goes through it? Some days I'm having a moment. I fucking hate everybody. But other days I love everybody and everybody. Then you hate black people, then you're racing them all. But if I'm listening, I'm listening or day I care about terrorists and their mothers and everything. And you know, it depends. We all have moments, but when you brand somebody, what we do is we go, you're a racist. You said one thing, so you're racist. Now I'm going to inflate that. I'm going to blow that up like a big balloon and fucking strap it to your face and you are out of the conversation wherever you've done ever brill cause you're my competition. That's right. That's right. And your ideas, your ideas might be threatening to me. More important. They're actually, they create violence towards me, therefore I need to save space. Oh, and by the way, I have all the answers.

Speaker 1:          02:47:32       My side is rooted in the truth and love plus crabs in a bucket. I'm trying to push those other clubs down so I can make my way to the tip of the tip. I love crab metaphors. God, goddammit. Best Way to do it is to call other people racist. That's it. Everybody's like, what? Me? What? What? You immediately get people on their heel. Who blood. We're not racist. Sexist tool. Yup. Yup. Oh Yo, what am I saying? We're not racing this actually with tribal, right? That's the thing. There's a smile, logical basis to sex, and that is patriarchal in and of itself. There's no biological basis for sex, not hormones, not x, Y, chromosome. There's no uterus are saying that on ironically in 2017 I they're saying it on a regular basis. Really? Yup. Yup. It's one of the Jordan Peterson discussions that he had with some, I don't know if it was a man who became a woman or a woman and became a man, but she was a professor.

Speaker 1:          02:48:29       He's a professor of medicine. No professor at University of Toronto professor in like transgender studies. I saw the debate. Yeah. It was hilarious. Debate. I know she's saying there's no sexual or bile. What is it? There's no difference between the popular misconception to think that there is a difference between a male and female. This doesn't exist and there was no biological, biological basis for Jenny. Like, well, okay, but if you go to the puppy door and you see, oh, I want a boy puppy and they'll give you a girl puppy, would you say you say, well, there's no biological basis. How about the power lifter? The power lifter that

Speaker 3:          02:49:08       became a woman and was a competitive power lifter as a man, I just stop you right there because she is a woman. She's always been a woman. Sorry. Don't be a piece of shit. No, she's a woman now. No, no, no, no. She's always been a woman just now. She gets to express herself in the most unique way. I see it when she was, even though she had an xy chromosome in a dick and she was competing in men's division, she was told him she was a woman. This is so transphobic. I can barely handle this. That's a question, man. She is her authentic self, so you get a lot of shit for your, when you talk this way from I'm only by people that are retarded. Yeah, exactly. I feel like most trans gender people would be very reasonable and not be inside a bunch of transgender people come to see me at the Ice House the other day.

Speaker 3:          02:49:48       They'll give me hugs. They were super sweet. I love that. They said with the Trans community loves you. I love you guys. Like there's a lot of trans people, by the way, that we're upset at the whole Bruce Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner fiasco. They were like, look, this is not who we are. Like you're, you just want more attention. Hey, your Kardashians. Exactly. Big Old male cardiac issue became a chick settled out. Right. You know, and there's a lot of people that felt sort of like also when they found out that Bruce Jenner then became Caitlyn Jenner, and then after that didn't believe in gay marriage.

Speaker 3:          02:50:19       So fucking weird gave you just crazy. You can, you can be a boy who wants to be a girl or a girl wants to be a boy. Doesn't mean you're smart, but doesn't mean you're smart and that's a problem, right? That's a problem. And if you are an intelligent person who is in the transgender community, you don't want that as your ultimate representation. You just don't. You don't want someone who's got that much of a contradiction where they look and they asked him about it. One of the most crazy things he said is like, well, oh, forwards. It's been the traditional work. Like what? Why not traditionalist? You're a man who became a woman that's not traditional. You don't believe in gay marriage because that's even dumber because you're talking about and you're changing biology and you're saying that some manmade bullshit fucking thing called marriage.

Speaker 3:          02:51:03       That guy shouldn't be able to do it if they love each other. But you should be able to be a girl. Right. Shut the fuck up. That makes me angry. So making me angry, I can't even, I ended up rubbing my eyes cause I don't know how to, I don't know how to respond to insanity is the only time I've ever seen ellen go after somebody. Really? Ellen had Caitlyn Jenner on her show and she actually went after and just notice how I said her not mis-gendering cause I'm a good person. Yeah you are. And I'll vote. I'll vote Democrat if it works. It's strange. Remember I stepped out on the podcast. You were like pull shit. I was like, I've heard it. Yeah. You called it way before anybody knew it was called. I got. That's cause I heard it from a reliable source and you called it like I'm on a same a year and a half early. Yes. Yes. Cause I knew it. He was already starting to feminize Feminine Eyes Look, looks also it's kids go to a school and he would show him bracelets and they were like, what's going on? It's hair would be in a burette. You and I need to get press credentials. What does this feminism site? Medusa magazine shuts down after founder admits it was pure satire.

Speaker 1:          02:52:10       Oh my God. Oh my God. Don't gender your pets. It was pure satire the whole time. Oh you beautiful people. Thank you on a tweet, that podcast. So thank you for being you. Thank you for fighting the good fight. Resist. That's the real resist. Keith Olbermann. I get what you're doing, but the real resist is to fight the nonsense nonsense with humor. We know what Michelangelo said, my favorite, their quote, criticize by creating, I got a new show for you and me. What you owe me. Yeah. We go to places we get high as fuck. Okay. We become journalists. We get high as fuck. And I don't say anything. I forget if, I don't know, we'll be doing just like this. You just, okay, you don't get high as fuck. I get high as fuck. I can take one hit. We go to places as journalists and we interview people, whether it's we go to like a Republican correspondence dinner or Democratic convention or we go and you just, you and I just, but drunk and high and we interviewed these people and we mocked this whole thing.

Speaker 1:          02:53:07       We get it. We get a view of how crazy the frenzy is. The center of the Hive for control of the Queen and watch those fucking crazy assholes just to call him. He called the center of the Hive Freak party worldwide. That's what we call it free party worldwide. We're not, Democrats were never publicly freak party worldwide. And we'd go, Oh man, we act as I'm dead serious about this. I say, we get Netflix to do this. Alright. And we just fucking travel. I'll do it in a heartbeat. Yeah. We get one dude to film must. He can keep his mouth shut and we never see each other. I always complain about on the podcast, I'm like, I never see rose. I sulk about it. I'm like, I see it twice. I, let's go. Let's go hunting. I know, but you're, you're, you're deer hunting. I have a fucking bowl, bro.

Speaker 1:          02:53:52       I know. I get a PR. I'm out. I've got a problem though. I've got a hunting problem. What? Oh, really? Kimchi and fucking hunting. You mean you were an extreme of both? Yep. I'd never seen that before from, you know, well, this is, you know, I'm out there every day shooting out of rubber dear. Are you? Yeah. It's a real problem. I kept fucking, I got gold in my arm to pull my bow back. Too much ad against stem cell shots. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going crazy. Yeah. I have a good time though. Fucking wonderful time. He fucking boxing shop gets mad at me for sparring, but I just love it so much that it rod bitch that it, right. I'm with you, but it rod. Yeah. Did you see that? That where Luke rockhold punched me in the fucking nose. Yeah. Don't want to do that.

Speaker 1:          02:54:33       And then, and then I had to go get makeup to my nose was so black and blue. I had to go. I'm at the fucking San Jose Improv. That's how I kind of take pictures of, this is ridiculous. I couldn't cover it. It was black and blue. Why'd you let him punch you? I didn't. I didn't. It wasn't like, hey look. I was like, well obviously he threw me headgear and I go, hey, look, listen to me right now. I'm a gazelle right now. And they're a bunch of lines out there. Let those people know like all those guys training that I'm, I'm a bitch that I'm an actor 50 and I dance around a gym. How bad did it hit? I spar because I do it with people who aren't athletic. Yeah, but it was way worse than that. What's that? What did he hit you with?

Speaker 1:          02:55:10       Oh, he punched me with his fucking glove right in the nose. That's when it was. It wasn't even, it got purple. Okay. Well, why do you think it's cute to fight professionals? Domo, first of all, I didn't want to, I thought it was going to hit mitts and he throws me headgear and I go, I don't want to do this. And Daniel Cormier goes, I got him first and core mate double legs me and look at it, look at that. Stupid knows are going to take pictures with ridiculous what didn't work. You should just stick to just straight boxing where you could school them with your skills. Oh yeah. You know me. I'll fucking slip those jazz pop, pop, pop about. That's the one of the worst things. Like why don't you get involved in Jujitsu that way you don't have to get hit. I'm going to.

Speaker 1:          02:55:45       Yeah, because this wrestling I miss. I Miss Mat work. I really do. When you first started doing Jiu Jitsu, way back when we were at Carlson Gracie's malaise. You took to it right away because I was a wrestler and it was like, oh, this is, I got trained with hence over here for a year. I love Jujitsu. I love it. Love it. I like boxing though. I really like. It's fun. It's such a challenge to me like, like, like, um, obviously Jujitsu is a whole world and it's really difficult, but there's something about boxing at my age I guess I like because it's, it's, I guess it's just such a mystery. It's such a mystery tenant. Well, you're learning a skill and pattern in the, yeah. And then on top of that you're also working out. Yes. That's one of the fun thing. Like you've used to find a sport, like here's a good one.

Speaker 1:          02:56:24       Soccer, I'll give you play soccer. You're going to fucking run around a lot, a lot. But you're also going to fuck your knees up you to fucking, and I'm tool. But boxing, you actually stay pretty injury free, believe it or not. And you can get to the point where you're not going to, yeah, but you wear headgear, you don't go crazy on each other. I'm not fucking fighting, you know? Do you know where you get hurt when you spar dudes who don't box and they swim for the fences and they catch you and you fight. Dudes like that are really good. [inaudible] the Great Wayne Mcculloch out spar with him. Sometimes I get in there, Wayne's fucking Wayne. Wayne at 44 is going to do whatever he wants even though he's 135 pounds, but it's, we're moving around. He'll hit me, but it's not, he's not going crazy. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          02:57:03       Yeah, exactly. That's, that's the best in Jujitsu to you get less hurt when you spar with someone who's really good. Correct. You don't win. You're going to get tapped a lot, but you won't get hurt. Right. He'll just control you and you learn patterns and then pretty soon you learn these patterns, you start practicing. Then you go against the guy who doesn't box a lot and you look good. Like you know what you're doing. Yeah. And he goes, dude, you've been doing it a long time ago. A opprobrium I look good. Just see my left. What's funny is you can find, somebody can learn how to hit myths. It's where you punching from and we'll kind of like, how are you setting that up? That's how are you not getting hit. Yeah. And what happens when you hit to the body and like that's the worst.

Speaker 1:          02:57:44       That is the fucking worst. That's why it kickboxing. He's so much more terrifying. And Molly, ty wants to, is getting need in the body. And I was watching John Wayne Parts. He had a video up on his instagram of him fighting when he was 17. The first title that he won. Wayne parts like 44 note John Wayne Carson, my boyfriend, and talking about 40, 41. And he's 41. And uh, still going after it, but like watching a video of him from when he was 17 years old knee and some dude in the body body's like, oh, oh, punches. I don't have time to condition my shin. This is him. 17 men net crazy. 1993. [inaudible] crazy. Look at those needs of the body son. Is that him and the Red John Wayne Parts. Fucking savage. Boom, boom, boom is a real fighter man. Yeah. It's um, it's a crazy way to express yourself, you know, but you really get to see a person's character in a fight.

Speaker 1:          02:58:42       That's the thing that makes it so crazy. It's just, it's this wild may lay of bones and flesh and you get to see how bright your star shines. It's also really awesome to learn defense and learn how to get out of the way. Learn how to block your eyes open when somebody kicking and stuff. Yeah, problem solving. How to figure out what to do when. Yeah. When the issues are what poon that's it by the way. I shouldn't, but just so everybody knows I didn't spar with Luke. Rockhold games just punched you in the face. I got to move around and they were really nice to me and they, they, they move me around at will so let's not, I hate when people like me say, I sparred with so and said, no you didn't spar. You didn't spar with them cause they'd beat the fuck that.

Speaker 1:          02:59:24       Fuck him. Yes. You moved around with them and they were being cool and you've got to throw some shit and do some stuff that you've learned and giggles. Yeah. Relax. Yeah. If I'd opened up with my taekwondo, they'd be sued. What if you did like with him? Bruce Lee movies did my wheel kick. You want to know fucking shit. I've seen it like sorta like when that not in the air. You have caution and Regan air. You know ty cobb could read the letters on the, I can see your kick coming a mile away, but you can read. You can read. You can read the label on my underwear.
