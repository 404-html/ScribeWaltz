Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Yeah. Ah,

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       what does that, it's breathing. It's power breeding folks into the nose, out through the mouth. I thought you were about to finish. No, that's not how I roll. I'm more grunt. Like it's more primal and sad. Ultimately the Joe Rogan experience on a quest for enlightenment is just trying to get rid of loads. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by speaking to getting rid of loads. The fleshlight fleshlight is the number one sex toy for men. It has a very unique blend of shit that was pulled out of the earth and converted firms and spicy oil and, and petrol chemicals into some crazy fake pussy tissue. That is outstanding. It really does work. And we have to be honest here. And the honesty is you've got an a fucking masturbator right? And if you're not, if you're not only not being honest with yourself, you're not being kind to yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:01:01       What do you want to do? You want to walk around confused all day? Do you walk around tortured by the thoughts of sex? Just some physical act that you need to accomplish and why? So sir, why? I'll tell you why, because you got this crazy body that used to be a monkey body 10,000 years ago were essentially the same except we were running from saber tooth tigers. I'll get where that same body and that same body didn't have vaccines and they didn't have doctors. It didn't have anything, so he'd fucking died off like crazy. So in order to keep the population live, it's engineered inside of us that we have to fuck a lot. And you can do that and you can choose to do that and you can be that guy.

Speaker 3:          00:01:37       Primates did it with frogs. Yeah, you can do with polyurethane. Yep,

Speaker 2:          00:01:40       exactly. What I'm, when I'm advising is just body maintenance, ladies and gentlemen, and, and get away from this crazy puritanical idea that we're not supposed to discuss masturbation and that men aren't supposed to have awesome sex toys like the fleshlight. All right ladies, you're vibrators in your dildos have been a source of humor for years. He, he ha ha, I'll just use my vibrator. And that seems to be okay with you. That's like some sort of an empowerment, but yet a man buying a flashlight is to be ridiculous. Ridiculed. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:02:14       We need the fan belt car battery driven. Fleshlight cause they have fucking machines but guys don't necessarily have it. Man. You don't want to get addicted. If you ever met a girl to addicted to her, I was trying to help you sell a flashlight. That's all I hear you. Thank you. Yeah. And it kills it because they get addicted to that more than sex. Like that sensation is, it's better than a dick just slowly sliding in you. You're like, it's, it sucks. You can fuck your pussy up forever. It is true.

Speaker 2:          00:02:37       It is real. I, I have met girls who are very honest about it. He said, you know, their husband can't get them off anymore. They have to use a vibrator. And you're like, wow, what happened? I've never, never actually been with a girl like that, but I was scared of him. Man. If I, if I talk to some girl and you know, we're, we're getting to know each other and she was like, you know, hey, I'm just really into vibrators and she'll let you know like right up front I collect,

Speaker 3:          00:02:57       have you seen my double tapered vibrating colossal Qing Dong?

Speaker 4:          00:03:02       It's like, you know that scares me. She's used to flying at high g's. You know the thing that a vibrator can do to you, it's just, it's just a totally different thing. Like that's an artificial thing that you've become addicted to honey. So I don't want that. So I don't think that I need anything other than what the f I think the flashlight is perfect. I don't even think they need to innovate. How about that? Go to Joe rogan.net. Click on the link for the flashlight. Use the code name Rogan and save yourself 15% off the number one sex toy format. So they,

Speaker 3:          00:03:30       and they did, they do have sex toys for women now they actually have, Lilo is air, which is like some of the, the high end Porsche versions of vibrators for women. So wow. Fuck your pussy up of those. So there you go. You can get that too. Yeah. If you're really into that, we really want to break that day, you know. Do you know Sam triple? He's actually doing something with flashlight, isn't it? Yeah, he's tall. He's doing like a man on the street thing at comic con with reflecting is perfect for that Sam Tripoli's and as an animal, he's doing men on the street with flashlights. Yeah. I don't know what that means, but

Speaker 4:          00:03:59       Oh gee, Microsoft, uh, really a runtime error. You got it too. Yes. I got one today. Abnormal program termination halfway. You go fuck yourself. Listen, we love these alien alien where computers are bad ass. And I like them because the Alienware sponsors MMA fighters. And if you're really into games, and I must admit I'm not anymore, but fucking God damn. If I was, this thing would be amazing. You play anything on this and high resolution, high screen, high frame rates.

Speaker 3:          00:04:25       I'm playing portal two in three D, right? That's fucking bad ass. But everything around it drives me crazy. Microsoft could suck a dick man. To be fair. She never alien. Where'd it was not responsible for that runtime error in any way, shape or form.

Speaker 4:          00:04:39       Some way it's, it's hard to believe how many viruses there are for Microsoft, for windows. When you look at it online and like the actual numbers of viruses that exist, you go, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. It's like the blood is this, this is, this is craziness. There are hundreds of thousands of viruses, hundreds of thousands of things that you can get. Many of them html based viruses. Sure. We just have to click on a link and boom, you're fucking cool.

Speaker 3:          00:05:09       In fact, you just want to chat with a hot single in your area. Suddenly your entire email address is owned by somebody in Czechoslovakia, so I did something pretty cool to recently to my Mac. There's a program that Norton gives out in the APP store that's free in it detects for malware and viruses and everything like that. Now I have malware, malware and it's, well, it's like a bunch of shipping bills. Ed's coming to me. I'm not used to saying it because I'd never have to deal with that. No, it's not a word you say. No, you're right. I don't think I've ever said it before either. Honestly. I have about, I don't know, five computers, MACs and most of them are just the dirtiest Max ever. Like downloading the grossest worst torrents and crap and nasty shit I had downloaded on all of my computers and I ran and now

Speaker 5:          00:05:58       not even one little baby thing.

Speaker 2:          00:06:00       No virus, nothing. I don't know. People will talk a lot of shit like people that are in windows, Mac and cheese get viruses too and you're like, just name one name one. Did they ever really come up with

Speaker 5:          00:06:10       Kevin would know all about this? They certainly, we should hold this. That's, I was being quick. That's the problem with doing these commercials like this and he said they become sometimes a podcast in the middle of a commercial. That's what they're kind of good though. Awesome. Yeah, that's true. Alienware invest. Well alienware's isn't even our sponsor. They just said

Speaker 2:          00:06:31       a company called Sucker Punch entertainment and it's got a sweet deal on these laptops. I did it specifically to try to support a company that supports MMA because these guys sponsor a lot of up and coming fighters and it's cool. I think that's huge. So, uh, you know, but Microsoft can suck a dick.

Speaker 5:          00:06:47       Yeah, I said it. I might turn this to tap in a tablet and that tablet can suck my dick, whatever that tablet, Microsoft, but the new surface. Why are you mad at the surface? And we need to start. I was like, come on. We need to, we need to get the music going. We also sponsor, we're also sponsored by [inaudible] dot com on nootropics. I love them. You can try this stuff and make him your cell phone lines. You can do that

Speaker 2:          00:07:12       kettle bells now and battle ropes. I just got my battle ropes in the male son. I should make a video showing a video of me hulking out with the battle ropes. I've got do that. It's an APP that's malware bitch malware, detect malware. And it's um, if you've, if you've never done kettlebells before, it's, you should really, if you can, you should get personal instruction. That's what I believe. If there's a gym near you or a crossfit gym where they could show you the right way to do it. I've had the very good fortune to have had a few different instructors and have someone physically there. It makes a big difference. There's plenty of videos though online. As long as you start out with very manageable weights and believe it or not, you can get a great workout. I can still to this day, even though I've been lifting kettle bells for years with one 35 pound Kettlebell, I mean there's this crazy workout that this guy has that I have no affiliation with. It's called the extreme kettlebell cardio workout and I've said this and now his DVD is totally sold out everywhere. It's really hard to find now. And, and I, I it's that good though. It's not good. This guy should, he should get all that money in more for free. For me, it's, it's, it's amazing. I recommend it to everybody all the time because it is one of the most brutal 40 minute workout ever and it's one 30 pound Kettlebell, 35 pound countable

Speaker 5:          00:08:30       seems like nothing. The first couple times you do it, it's like, well you're activating every muscle in secondary movers for balance. You're constantly engaged head to toe, you're using your hold,

Speaker 2:          00:08:39       but the concept behind kettle bells is that you're using your whole body as one unit as opposed to things like a lot of people like they think of lifting weights is like bicep curls or tricep extensions. That's actually kind of an unnatural way to exercise and it actually usually creates imbalances because if you're not, you know, real careful, like if you do a lot of quad exercises, you got to do hamstring exercises to fuel on a biceps. You have to do trust them. So I get, and then you also probably have to balance your backout as well. Like your, your whole body as a whole is a much better option using your body as a whole. And you can do it with less weight, which it's a really amazing thing. It does. You're conditioning your, your weightlifting and your conditioning all in one big group instead of a, the way most people do it, like by breaking things up and sets it's way more fun and it translates to anything you were trying to do, like physical, if you have a sport that you're trying to do that involves strength and a and speed endurance, kettlebells will help you fucking tremendously.

Speaker 2:          00:09:38       So we just started carrying them. There's a bunch of great deals on them. Um, we're, we're selling them literally as cheap as we can sell them there. It's really the like, oh dude, it's ridiculous. The logistics of a small company like on it, you know, I mean basically we've only been around for like a year. You know, a company like this, it was mostly selling nutrients to all of a sudden goes to selling these fucking cannon balls. These things are huge, but they're the best quality you can buy.

Speaker 3:          00:10:05       Are you guys drop shipping them or you have like storage space now and you're buying

Speaker 2:          00:10:09       storage space? The whole thing. It's crazy. Yeah. It's, um, you know, it's, it's, there's a lot involved in it, but what we're concerned with is that we're selling you the best shit available. And these kettlebells or York kettle bells or the best kettle bells you can buy their fucking perfect. I have him in my house. They're, they're absolutely perfect and they'll last for a million years. They're cast iron. You don't need a gym. You need a couple of these kettle bells and some youtube videos and you will have workouts for the rest of your fucking life. I mean, there's a million free videos out there showing all sorts of different exercises. People, you know, put themselves to these crazy crossfit routines. And there's, there's high weight, low rep routines and there's every kind of exercise. All you need to do is look online anyway on a.com is where it's at.

Speaker 2:          00:10:57       Get the kettle bells. We have the battle ropes and, and when it comes to nootropics, any of the things that, whether it's Alpha brain or a shroom tech sport, which is an awesome uh, endurance supplement or shroom tech immune, which is a supplement that actually contains a mushroom that tricks your body into thinking that it's got a cold. So your body fires up its immune system thinking that the mushroom is like a, like a cold, but it's not, you're just over clock and your body. Yeah. You just giving your body something leaves your body like gets pumped up for a fight. That never happens. And so you know, if you come into a common cold, you when to find a better chance.

Speaker 3:          00:11:32       Don't, don't keep your on, don't keep your on it products in your car. If it's hot outside by the way, because it melts into like an on it ball and I knew she'd just take, just take the whole fall, stuff it up your ass. Take it anal like an apple. That's how you eat your apples up your ass. No, no, no. Eat it takes her as asshole like a horses mouth. He's got a feed bag

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       hanging over it right now. It's got a tongue. Whoa, settle the fuck down kid. Uh, anyway, uh, use the code Dean Brogan and you will save yourself 10% off any and all supplements. Uh, there's 100% money back guarantee. If you order a shroom tech, have you ordered Alpha brain, whatever you ordered the first 30 pills, if you decide that it doesn't do as advertised or do a enough to satisfy you, you just say the stuff socks and you get 100% of your money back. You don't have to return the product. We're way more concerned with making sure that nobody feels ripped off and way more concerned that everything that we sell has to be something that I 100% totally believe in. And so that's why we have this set in place. So let's say it's as easy as possible to get your money back, right? That's it. Pitches. Do you have the music? Kevin Pereira is here a free man out in the sphere of the world. No longer under any type of contracts

Speaker 6:          00:12:55       all day.

Speaker 4:          00:12:59       Dj Brian does it. Yen in the MIB. Amen. He's silly bitch. How dare you. I dare you come up with new ways to be silly ladies. Gentleman, Kevin prayers here. Brian. We for sure on the right channel. Yeah, I ladies and gentlemen, we know for sure we're on the right show. That same shit scares the fuck out of me. What just happened? Right? Time error like jasmine pop up, new stuff that we got ahold of this new uh, new God powder. Yeah. This new mothers creation. There's a, it's a, it's a type of pod called Sativa. You know what that is, right? I've heard of it a little bit about that. I read a Wiki or to have it on the interwebs. This, it's called sage. Yes. The, the name of this one particular strain. It's, it doesn't seem like Potts should be different. That one should really have that much of a different impact on you. But some of 'em, some of 'em man, you get ahold of me and go, okay, what's this? Yeah, what the Hell is this?

Speaker 7:          00:13:59       It's like, it's like when you, when you, you know, you get Tequila blackout a few times and someone introduces you to whiskey. Now this is, this is supposed to be the same exact thing.

Speaker 4:          00:14:07       Yeah. But it's completely different. How is that, man, why is Tequila different than whiskey? Is it because, uh, most people want to say that alcohol is just alcohol and if you're drunk on wine, you're drunk and beer. It's all the same. Yeah. I don't, but it doesn't seem to be that. What does that, it doesn't at all.

Speaker 7:          00:14:26       I mean, it's gotta be because of the, I'm trying to think of the environment. Like let's say normally when you have Tequila, I would say you're probably, um, you're probably gonna have a shitty Mexican restaurant somewhere, right? There's a Mariachi music in the background and you're, you're all those senses combined give you a very different drunk feel. Right? Not True at all. I've had Tequila in multiple settings. It's the same filthy, vomiting, blackout high. For me, it's a dangerous is

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       due. Like I can't drink it. It's, there's something about decision making. This is, I like looking at it and I go like, this is going to be four days of hell.

Speaker 4:          00:15:01       Yeah. Being drunk, man. What a fucking weird idea to take humans and they voluntarily inject something into their system, swallow something that tastes awful and all just to be free of themselves for a little bit. Yup.

Speaker 3:          00:15:18       In the fact that that is the one that you and I can go easily and quickly and legally consume and then get behind the wheel of a car and do all sorts of tragic stuff that is just murderous and torturous to society. And yet that is the one that is completely legal.

Speaker 4:          00:15:33       It's so hilarious that our system is set up this way in this day and age and the base of the past when they could lie and what we, but now that we have on the information, the fact that it's set up like this, like you mother.

Speaker 3:          00:15:46       Well, and the fact that, look, I don't give, I hate political polls. I hate polling. I don't trust any of that shit. I never get called for him. I don't know anybody else that does not. Apparently they're pulling the nation, but the majority of this country actually wants it to be decriminalized and legalize. And even with all the Info and the political weight behind it, not going to happen anytime.

Speaker 4:          00:16:05       Yeah. And, and what you were saying about Paul's like who the fuck is answering those poles?

Speaker 3:          00:16:10       Who's the people who still answer their phones when they get a call on their landline? Maybe youth there QBC and take another Werther's original and take a poll.

Speaker 4:          00:16:18       What the fuck is taking polls really pulls him was one of the most ridiculous things ever. Because all you're going to get is people that are busy

Speaker 3:          00:16:26       and it's just people that have nothing to do. You're on TMZ. Do you ever do the polls? What are the polls like? Is She hot? Is she not well, those poles matter in this world. I can. Those kinds of posts are the ones that matter.

Speaker 4:          00:16:40       No Man, I don't, I don't go on any poles. I'm not, I don't, I'm not fucking filling anything out. I know I'm not no interest, no interest to ask. Yes. Consumer questions.

Speaker 3:          00:16:51       When I, when I'm on like the, when I'm on the telephone and it pops up with the, hey, if we press one, if you're okay with a three to five minute survey, at the end of this call, I go, yeah, I'll press one. Because in my head somewhere, a flag pops up on a computer and tell somebody that my call, he's going to lead to feedback. I don't actually take the survey, but I go out of my way to say it. Yeah, yeah. I'll take the survey after the call and you just become a random in the system. Probably. I'm a, I'm a ghost in the machine somewhere, number generator, and you just fucking with their numbers pretty much for no reason. You hacked her numbers. You know when those cars are in the, in the malls w uh, that, uh, like it says like sign up to win this car that's signing up to become on the worst spam mailing list ever. You'll start getting phone calls and spam your business card in the fishbowl at a restaurant or is there like, you're just, you're just giving away your info at that point. You're saying please mark the tiny, somebody did that, did that for a living and he says, dude, they just make so much money cause collecting like hundreds and of people's

Speaker 7:          00:17:50       complete like information addresses. Everything they do is they, you have to fill this shit out and then you put it in and it's worth it for them to give away a car to get all that information yet. But by the time they get enough, they're selling your information and getting a lot of money in that car. Is it nothing to the amount of money? It's worth thousands and thousands of people's information. How do you think they'd do it? Do you think they'd go to have like Volvo and make a deal and they say, hey listen, we're going to give your car away. I think they go and they say, Ah, this $20,000 car or the $70,000 cars going to be an investment of x, we're going to get y for their data that that's a done deal. They'll just buy the car and set up something like that.

Speaker 7:          00:18:30       So you don't even think they do it through the car company? I think they just buy it. They'd probably go to some sweet promotional discount. They'd probably get refurbished cars somehow. Cardone's he's themselves. We'll do that just to get, collect data on people who are interested in that vehicle and willing to go out of their way to look at it. So they're doing it themselves. There's independent companies that are doing it, selling it to them. Right. But when you have like a Cadillac CTSV showcased in a mall and then you can win that. I think I've got to think Cadillac is paying for that. No, no, but in some cases, yeah, I bet some pilot times. Yeah. Like if there's a new car that just came out and they're trying to draw attention to it, then they might work something about the mall. But if you go to most malls, it's just some random cars sitting there and it's like win a trip to Hawaii or something like that.

Speaker 7:          00:19:11       Does. The pro tip is when you meet somebody you don't like in this life, when you're networking or whatever, the pro tip and real life in life, man, it's a real life pro tip, right? As a wall hacking and battlefield, this shit's gonna help you out in real life. Okay. What does it take the business card to someone you absolutely hate when you're networking and just make sure you toss it and all of those balls at the malls do make copies of it. Yes, absolutely. Spread there. Cause this quarter and everyone, why do you have a stack of my business cards? Just want to let people know you're awesome. Yeah. I'm your number one fan bro. Jesus Christ. Yeah. It's a weird thing that people want to collect that much data, isn't it? That's that's what's important. You're reaching the most amount of people. We ain't able to sell them things.

Speaker 7:          00:19:51       Being able to convince them to sell you a sell you things. What the fuck do you think is going on in Nigeria that makes them so good at scamming? I mean there's one place in Africa that's like really known for crashing dudes thinking that it's like a girl and it's just a Nigerian man behind it. It's like tricking or my, the, the, the, the high priest of the land or whatever has millions of dollars tied up in a bank account. We just need $10,000 and a little info from you to get it out. Those kinds of scams as well. I bet they have just like endless pictures of a woman. I would say that's what they started so they can, here's me here, here's me there. You know, you could just, I love the people that fuck with the scammers back. Have you seen those sites? Yes.

Speaker 7:          00:20:34       Look, we would really love to give you $1 million and we haven't, we're ready to do it. We just need you to get completely replace your mouth with stalag tights. If you could just get that operation done or put diamonds in all of your teeth and then record yourself singing the, uh, the, the, the theme tobacco back to life for facts of life. They, they're like make them go out of their way to do crazy shit to release the money. Oh yeah. Really? Yeah. And I sent an email, they'll sing songs and record video. Someone had them shoot like promos wearing specific like tee shirts and stuff for his company. It was great. He scanned the scammers. How many times have the scammers one though? I mean they must enough to make it worth doing time and time again and still do it from this day and age.

Speaker 7:          00:21:10       How many things are doing it? Do you think it's like a real business in Nigeria? I would assume so. I mean if gold farming and Diablo can be an industry in China, you know like that was the game came out on the day it was released. There were bots and they were communities and there were sites to all the non dorks. Exactly what you mean. So, uh, all right. So when see us folks, when we were busy not having sex, we figured out games to play and Diablo is one of them. And you can buy, there's a real money and a virtual currency auction house in the game so you can use that currency to buy new stabs and swords and pieces of armor and flair and it'll give you a poison resistances. It's really intricate shit, very important stuff. So you can use that goal to get it, but some gamers don't want to spend the time or they just want to buy a brand new character so they can go kill the whatever boss.

Speaker 7:          00:21:56       So they're willing to pent spend $10 of real world money. So someone needs to create a bank for that and they create these, these systems where they farm for gold and they do it in a bunch of games to do well. The Warcraft they do in Diablo pretty much any game that has a currency online. There's a secondary marketplace where people are grinding through the game, doing repetitive things that are known to give you a lot of that currency so they can sell it back on the market low and there's entire warehouses, cyber cafes, you name it. Full operations where people are employed to just click, click, click through any given game to get virtual currency so they can sell it back to people that are and inflate it slightly and played it for our way to show where there was a couple that had a child and they were both addicted to some game.

Speaker 7:          00:22:36       Oh and remember what the game was. But it was one of the saddest things in the world to watch this couple like argue over who has to watch the kid while they're playing their fucking game. Their debt. Sheldon had died. Yeah. Cause parents neglected down playing starcraft or world of Warcraft. Yeah, it's, it's so frightening. Yeah. Well what they need to do is give the kid an iPad so they can farm along with Mommy and daddy's wasted process. Like get that kid working. It's so bizarre though. The pull is so strong that it's really like it. It's just like a drug. You could call it a drug. Absolutely. The addictions to video games are very drug like any addiction to anything. I mean you can, people will find it in a way to be addicted to whatever it is they want to be addicted to and it's just as bad, just as deadly, just as caustic as anything else.

Speaker 7:          00:23:21       Funny what a weird animal we are, where we can get addicted to doing things, not just like not just sensations that are caused by drugs, but we can get addicted to doing thing. Creatures of habit like I, how much of your life is on autopilot? I mean you lead a pretty diverse life where you're doing different things at different times, but the essential is of your life. Like some, some people will tell you that 80% of like a relationship in life is autopilot. That you're really only living 20% of any given like longterm relationship because you established such patterns with yourself and with your job and with your loved ones that that Shit's on autopilot. You're really only commanding 20% at any given time when you decide to do something out of the norm. That was, that was a stat that was told to me, and I kind of believe it. I don't know if 80 is right, but how much of your life is actually kind of on autopilot if you think about it?

Speaker 2:          00:24:08       Yeah. Well, I think for a lot of folks it's the easiest way to get through the day too. If you're doing the commute every day, hour and a half to the office, you know some people, it's really an hour in the morning. Every morning just stuck, stuck every day for an hour. Some people commute four to six hours to come in from long island. Do you ever see that that hall coming in from Long Island to Manhattan? Holy Shit, I did that once at nine o'clock in the morning and I was like, this can't be real. This is no way. This is real. You make everybody stop. No wonder why this sucks and the whole thing of tolls. By the way, what a fuck? What a fuck tolls are

Speaker 7:          00:24:47       paid to have this bridge installed and now we're going to charge you every time you drive on it

Speaker 2:          00:24:52       off the bridge. But we kind of like you paying us every week and we're pretty sure you're just going to keep doing it. So toll, and that's one of the reasons why Manhattan's traffic, it's so fucking brutal as you're paying tolls all over the place tolls to get in from long island, it's toll from Jersey. There's this fucking totals all over to me and it's just, and they're like 10 bucks, right? Some of them. Yeah. So we had like 10 bucks, nine bucks, 10 bucks to do, go over on my country bridge. That is corruption of bridge that fuse paid for it already paid. That's the, you paid for it as well. Like yes, it's already paid for. You paid for it half the time. As a tax payer, it's a great way to generate revenue. Right? Isn't that a funny way of saying it should be okay to rip you off, rip you off and fuck up traffic for everybody because we will have more cutting money and it's, I like it.

Speaker 7:          00:25:41       The Tsa, like we paid, we've paid billions if not trillions of dollars for this institution to erode our own freedoms to grope us. We paid for the privilege of longer lines and radiation. That's insane. And now I'm, well they did a couple of pilot programs to like, it was basically like a fast lane through the Tsa Shit, but she had to sign up and some of them you had to pay. So we had to pay for the institution which degrades us and slows us down and we can pay extra to bypass it in a quicker way.

Speaker 2:          00:26:07       Well they need need to find out that you're not a creep that's there. Their re justification. That's the justification. Do a background check on you and go well Kev, a prayer or you've been in a federal penitentiary seven times for selling crystal meth. We want to make sure you can still fly southwest crystal meth in your underwear though. You've got weird baggies that show up on our scans taped to your ball sack. You want to explain, sir?

Speaker 7:          00:26:31       First of all, those are feed. I eat through my asshole. It's like a horse. I feed it apples before every flight. I learned about it from Brian

Speaker 2:          00:26:38       having a hand, having black math taped to your balls. There's no, you could say, wait

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       a minute, we're the fuck. How'd that get there? This is someone else had to this bag, sir. There's no fucking way that was there, man. I can't even believe this is real. What's going on, man? Do you guys do something to me? I always love that unconscious when it's like, oh, we found this crack pipe in your glove box. Although I don't even know what that is. It's got your initials on it. Well that's, that's a coincidence. That's not even, yeah man. It's Jr. There's a lot of jail, a whole lot of them Jr Roblin. How would it you say your name? That's the meth addict cousin of JK Rowling. That one? Yeah. Harry Potter didn't have any magic. She was just tripping on trucker math truck or there's a big sign in Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood. I was, um, I was driving down Santa Monica and there's a huge billboard that says, do you have a problem with meth?

Speaker 5:          00:27:32       And it just shows a guy, like a regular guy, just his face, like, Oh shit, I'm on math. And I'm looking at, I'm like, wow, how many people are on method? They need to have a bill burri and there's that billboard going to help you. If you're on math, you're not going to look up and go, oh my God, I'm the billboard guy. I should really stop this here. Call this number, call this is my room. And then when I got to do it, I'll give you money. No watching it. You get me off math watching pieces of your own face fall off at like a public restroom mirror that's cracked. It smells like urine when you look at that and go, this met things. All right, but oh my God, I'm on a billboard now. I need to stop this. Does anybody do research before they do, man and go, wow.

Speaker 5:          00:28:14       Okay. It looks like this is super addictive and completely fucks your life up, but I do want to get high. Is there an Erowid for math? Is there like a first time, some difficult experience? Center is, Arrowhead is awesome. erowid.org is awesome for any, any experiences you've had that uh, even that, what, whatever the fuck the actual chemical is for bath salts. You know, what is it an MDM? A UCB? I think as well there's, there's so many of them that had been classified as bath salts or plant food that it's hard to narrow it down. It's, is that what it is? I was saying that the other day, but I wasn't sure. There's a bunch of different chemicals and they can eat. It's not like it's one unit. Not at all. All this pass. All right. Yeah. Anything that will cause somebody to eat somebody else's face is now a bath.

Speaker 5:          00:28:58       So even though it really was said that it was pot, pot, he was high on pot. You just had mad munchies. Man, that guy was fucking unstable. That's it. And that doesn't make for a flashy news report, but well, imagine if Paul really did do that to him. That pop would be worth millions. Like, listen, I know that dude eight, that dude's face, but I wouldn't do that. I want to know what that fucking wolverine pies like you imagine a pop mean, maybe, maybe make a fucking idiot, eat a guy's face, but I'm, I'm, I'm 100% fucking sure that there's not a drug in the world that you could give me that would change my mind about eating the dude's face. You know, there's only so high that you can get and still be conscious like Jesus Christ, you're weak, bitch. You didn't fight off the urge at all.

Speaker 5:          00:29:44       But just society, that guy's face, if they've, I mean there's drugs that could turn that guy's face into a candy bar or something that's equally as delicious. Sure. I think when candy bars started screaming, don't eat my face, it's me. Mark. They're not saying that. They're saying it feels like you're hugging me with your tongue. That's what they say when you're tripping. All the guys screaming to his eyeballs out. I think you're silly. It's a Unicorn giggling like no way could be so high that you would attribute it so high that I thought it was a molecule and in the cushion of my own couch and I was swimming through my couch cushions. Yeah. I thought my hands were dying. We're just closing your eyes and fantasizing. You weren't involved in a life or death struggle with a guy's face in your team. But I also wasn't snorting bath salts or taking this crazy sativa spot.

Speaker 5:          00:30:25       Yeah. I don't know about that. Maybe just got stable. Well Bitch of pot was legal. You wouldn't have that kind of pot. Nobody would want it to do you. Did you have you used arrowhead to figure out something like you're going to take and how it's gonna Affect you or to do research on chemicals? Cause it's the only reason I've ever tried anything in my life. Yeah. It's very well documented. Yeah. It's, I mean there's so many different substances you could research there too. It Shit. You would never even think of morning glory seeds and you know, San Pedro Cactus and you know how people have prep prepared it and I don't know how the fuck they get away with it, but it's amazing. It's amazing. A website and even for documenting things that are, that are still legal. Yeah. I wonder if the owner of that website, just shitting bricks every day just lives in Harlem, then maybe they live somewhere liberal or you can get away with more.

Speaker 5:          00:31:13       It's just so we're so, so gross. How fucking stomped down we are here, especially in the idea of drugs. You know, the idea of you volunteering to do something to your body and that being a possibility. Just that thought of you making that decision. It's a possibility of you getting caught in the process of it and locked in a cage for a long fucking time, depending on what different thing you decided that you're going to ingest and what color you are as well. What's your economic status? So really it's disgusting. It's so systematic. Fucking disgusting. Embarrassing, stupid. In a world where you can go to cvs, do you have it's slave labor. It's legalized slave labor and especially because the institutions are now privatized and it's such a big industry that lobbies like it's, it's privatized, it's slavery, it's all go down that cvs or any drugstore, and I shouldn't say that, uh, any drug drugstore aisle that has one of those little mini supermarket type drug stores, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:32:08       Will they have like a, like a little freezer section where they sell ice cream and things and then they have an alcohol lane and it's a lie dude of hard core shit. And any one of those bottles, you drank the whole thing. You're dead, you're dead, you're dead, you're dead, you're dead, you're dead. People have done it. We've done it all the time. People would die. People die of alcohol poisoning all the time. It's not as many as people die from probably drunk driving accidents. I mean, I, that's probably, but it's still alcohol related. Alcohol related did death of just drinking

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       yourself to death. That's super possible. You know, people do that all the time. It's ridiculously easy to do.

Speaker 7:          00:32:47       So you just go to a store and it's right there and pod is illegal. But people are having these conversations and maybe it's only because I'm choosing to dial into the kind of people that have these conversations, but like how long is it going to take? How many people have to have conversations like this before there's actual change. I people are crazy people with money. There's a lot of people that don't believe in drugs take like Xanax. No. Things like that. Yeah. They'll take Sativex. They'll take the the chemical version of a sativa drug, but they will not take the, the one that the government has told them is illegal. Yeah. I know a lady who takes Xanax and she won't let her husband smoked pot. She doesn't want her husband doing drugs. The houses pitches on Salix every night. It's Hilarious, man. It's hilarious. They just puppet so maybe so do we need to lobby them to, to have that become illegal as well because deaths happened on that and who will abuse it? Nope. I think you should be able to take Xanax all day. Exactly. You enjoy it. Dot. Marrero,

Speaker 2:          00:33:44       joy, Xanax. He takes Xanax every day and he loves it. And I love dom. And if that's what makes him happy,

Speaker 7:          00:33:49       better living through chemicals, go 40 men, he'd given him Xanax. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:33:53       Never say that someone should not be able to do something. It's just the things that become obvious like math. Does anybody have a good math story? I mean, does anybody, it's not a great one to have my shit together, but fucking I got on math and let me tell you something, dude. I really looked at my whole world with clarity and purpose and I threw out all the negative people in my life and I started running.

Speaker 7:          00:34:14       Good morning. No, it leads to you in your basement with chemicals like bins of chemicals and fucking break fluid in a friend's bathtub. You're running outside, coughing up blood. You've got bloodshot eyes and you know you're out of your mind. But if you happen to cross one of them billboards, you will turn your life around

Speaker 2:          00:34:35       by 1500 boxes of cold serum.

Speaker 7:          00:34:40       Listen, I get really bad allergies. Uh, listen, I'm going to need 400 boxes of sudafed if that's cool. No, you don't look sketchy dude. You bring your own brown box to cvs. Excuse me, sir. You're, you're scratching your own neck off. Could you just be careful, there's a lot of neck under your fingernails,

Speaker 2:          00:34:56       bullying, like rural Texas where they're just making crazy meth labs. How many people have in the past like walked into a drugstore and just Poland

Speaker 7:          00:35:07       enough to where I have to show my id if I want some Claritin because I'm feeling a little stuffy enough people have done that. I have to prove that I'm not going to make a meth with an over the counter product. You,

Speaker 2:          00:35:18       your id not amazing. And there's an amazing that that's the drug you hear about. Like one of my wife's friends just talking about the small town where she lives in Seattle. And uh, you go to this website where they like talk about the town, you know, like there's websites for every town, like message boards. What do you, what do you think about this area? All anyone says, and any of these rural places is math. It'd be great if we didn't have so much fucking meth. I mean, there's meth all over the place and keep away from the math people. Like if you go into small areas like small, shitty, you know, low income communities, boom, you got meth. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:35:56       it's cheapest, easiest. There you go. But it's amazing how bad it sucks. It's an epidemic. It's amazing how bad it's up. You mentioned that they focused all their time on just math because there's no positive math reasons and stiff like fucking with all these marijuana and people just spin those that resource to go just after math.

Speaker 2:          00:36:14       Yeah. Here's the difference. You ever watch a Cheech and Chong movie? Yeah, of course you did. Right? Right. Now, have you ever watched an episode of breaking bad? Yeah. Now we're in, which show is someone more likely to get fucking shot in the face, right? The breaking bad that you deal with meth people, you deal with violence and craziness. If you show up at some, you know, pot place that's a dispensary it cannabis care dispensary and you come on real guns blazing with bulletproof vests on, you know you're not going to get fragged. You know you're, you're right.

Speaker 3:          00:36:44       You're going to trip over someone doing yoga and eating Keenwa did you see that shit in Long Beach where the cops are stepping on the dude when he was stepping, stepping on his neck when he was down and then busting the security camera really like there's like you could make, I hate there's, it's totally illegal. I'd like to believe we live in a society where, Oh, you know like video was supposed to release everything and end every ounce of controversy and look there's proof, here's the videotape and all it has done is lead to arguments over context and how interpretation of those videos I disagreed. There has definitely been a lot of arguments but God damn is it fixed a lot. It's brought a lot to light and you know, just like this, I totally get that, but it's, I'm just shocked at the amount of that analyst analyzing that can go on when it gets in the way. Like some people were saying, well look, the guy was probably trying to resist and pull back, which is why it looks like he is. That's why he stepped on his neck. He was just in the thing. How do you justify breaking the security camera? There's no justification for that whatsoever.

Speaker 2:          00:37:36       That young man wasn't resisting at all and he didn't do anything and it was kind of creepy and I don't want to bring race into it, but I have to, when a white guy steps on the neck of a down black man, you know though that that's like what, first of all, he did it to my son. I'd beat your ass. Right, right. You Fat. Fuck, you're just stepping on some kid's neck for what? Because, because that's your job today. That's not, that's nothing in your job description is John. This is shit. You're not in threatened by this person any way, shape or form. You, you might as well be walking into a fucking cigarette store. It's no, it's no different. You know, and that jackbooted thug behavior. There's no way that should ever be tolerated by any person who's a member of the police force because the police is supposed to be us. It shouldn't be US versus them. It shouldn't be. It should be. The cops should be thinking about their job is to protect their community. That's what it really should be to observe. The law is to protect their community. When they start doing shit like that, you're not protected enough and you fake piece of shit. You're just being a, you're not

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       in danger. You know that side of criminal, that's some kid who's a volunteer. He wasn't even getting paid. He was trying to figure out how to, how the business worked and you know, he's getting out of college fucking Douche bags, food to his neck. Stepdaughter man, he stepped on him when he was down, stepped on his back and then his neck just decided to step on him like he could do whatever the fuck you want it to him. He was his, there will be an hour, there will be an equally as loud chorus saying that man was a working in a drug operation and he was clearly in a, in a criminal and it's their job to squash down those types.

Speaker 2:          00:39:12       I bet that fact I didn't train. I bet that guy that walked in, that guy's neck and back never trained in his life. I bet he's never been humbled in a gym, but he's never had a tap out. I bet he's never done rounds. You fat fuck dummy.

Speaker 5:          00:39:26       Yeah. Or maybe he was picked on all his life and that's why he decided to grab a badge and a belt. I mean, it could be probably not. Probably just didn't have a lot of options. So fucking stupid. It's so stupid. It's such a gross thing. That guy should, he should either look sincerely apologize and do something about it or he should be fired. There's no way you shouldn't be a cop. But that kind of attitude. And it's crazy. My brother's a cop, so I get a crazy amount of perspective from him on it. And, and, uh, you know, and I'd like to believe he's one of the great ones. Not a good one like, but there's no, there's no justifying that there's no, there's no making that situation in that video. Right. There's just none. I support cops 100% of them.

Speaker 2:          00:40:03       I always do. I think it's a really fucking hard job and I think they're under pressure all the time and they're asked to perform in these crazy situations and abide by the law when their own life is in danger because of their job, their own life is in danger. I'm a big supporter cops, but I think two things. First of all, I think they don't get paid enough. I think it should be a much more difficult job to get. It should be a prestigious job. We should respect them. They should be an honored part of our community. We should, we should look at them like what they are though. They're heroes. That's what they should be. But instead they're not paid enough. They're treated like shit. They're, they're treated like shit in the media that treated like shit by people. And so they develop an attitude and US versus them attitude.

Speaker 2:          00:40:45       And you know, it's just an unfortunate part of psychology. Teachers develop that attitude as well. There's a lot of teachers out there that started with no noble aspirations until they realize what $35,000 a year actually pays for. And after awhile they get angry. They get bummed out about it. I think there should be positions in our society that are revered and being a police officers, one of them, and being a teacher is also one of them. You know, you can be hippy all you want man, but guess what? Every people, everybody doesn't play by the fucking rules and you need cops, you need cops and you need guns, period. These, you know, there's no way you're going to keep bad people out of the, you know, out of the system unless you have cops. They should be an honored, respected part of our society. So when they see something like this, they should fucking do something

Speaker 5:          00:41:28       clearly. It shouldn't be that thin blue line cover up here, suspended with pay and we're going to review and it's bullshit.

Speaker 7:          00:41:34       They should be out. Right? They should be more outraged about it than we say. It's a current mood. Maybe you had a shit day. Maybe the kid said something to them stupid, but you shouldn't do that, man. You shouldn't do that. They should because you shouldn't be there. Anybody who's going to write a dispensary should be forced to smoke a joint first just because we tell you if you're nice and stone, we're not going to step on a dude's neck. You're going to be like, that's a great line here. It's so true, right? It's so wrong. It's such an easy color too. It's really embarrassing and most of the cops, Garrett guarantee you they're, they're not wanting to do this. No, this is upper management. Whoever the fuck is in charge of making these decisions, a numbers, man, it's all numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers. Get your rest up, get your quota and make sure people are going to jail because we built more jails and we need to fill the jails. It's all numbers

Speaker 4:          00:42:17       incredible that we try to call ourselves a free country. How dare we.

Speaker 7:          00:42:22       Yeah. I mean look fucking subject to this free enough to be able to say this in a room at this time on the Internet, like we got that amount of freedom. That's really it.

Speaker 4:          00:42:30       Thank [inaudible] we can't do, you can't have a free country that makes as much money as we do. You really can't because the only way you can make as much money as we do as a team, as a whole, as a country. It's like you kind of fucking dominate all the parts of the world that have all the good shit. And if you don't get the good shit from them, you know, like what? How, how are you gonna how are you going to run things? You gotta you gotta you gotta run things span. We've got to have a lot of fucking fossil fuels. We've got to have law. It's almost like you can't be like really cool and run a country like America. It's like it would never happen if everybody wants to hang out with the cool guy. They went home with a guy who has to lithium if we want them, they want to make some bad rejected to anybody, to any, any, you know, any negativity at all. There was none of the, none of the negativity associated with our law enforcement. None of the negativity that you saw in that video. None of the negativity when it comes to siding with alcohol over, you know, natural drugs, none of that. If you took away all of that, then you know,

Speaker 7:          00:43:28       I gotta be honest. I, my, my asshole post puckered so tight as those police sirens behind me lie, they started crying. I was like, fuck, they zeroed in on our Ip address and I'm gonna have to stand up and ask if I'm being detained and then going to get maced and fuck. I feel like getting a speed ticket is going to turn into an occupy protest for me. Every time I hear a siren, it's like tragic.

Speaker 4:          00:43:46       It gets worse and it should have gotten better. Yes, we should have figured out a way to make it better, but instead with the age of information, it seems like the tightening down, it's like being coming more and more absurd.

Speaker 7:          00:43:57       Just wait till there's a UAV is flying into this room information with a camera in your face. Just letting them know that they're listening cause you've triggered the keyword sativa. Hello. That's all weird. It's going to happen. Lord has already made commitments to putting drones everywhere. I think there there's, and I'm blanking on the gentlemen, there was a senator who's trying to get legislation passed to make it illegal for drones to be used to surveil citizens without a warrant. And that is exactly the kind of protections we need to go for. Yeah, but you really, you're going to have stealth drones. Is it going to bugs? They're going to have fake bugs the ball, if they certainly got them now, like if you believe in smart dust, you could have stepped in something that relayed your location in certain keywords

Speaker 5:          00:44:35       possible to run an empire and do it while being nice. You're doing it is if you're doing it, you don't want to screw the well On. It is a supplement company. It's very, it's a simple, it's way more now and in five years it's the empire. It's the cult. I'm signing up and call Devonna. I'm on it. Get on it. Yeah. Is it possible to run America and be like, and not have jackbooted thugs raid dispensary's and not have privatized prisons and not have ridiculous checkpoints and you know, and is it possible to do that?

Speaker 7:          00:45:10       I don't. I think it is. I mean, I think, I think you can still manipulate markets the way that they do and I think it could still still allow them that can do that, but give us enough freedom to where I don't have to have my balls, you know, fond or the fly to Vegas or not go through a police check minor, let me smoke my pot like you can, you can manipulate the whole Libor scandal that is beyond me right now. The London interbank offering rate. It's like it, it dwarfs our little scandal that we had here in what, 2008 2006 what is their scandal? So their scandal is, it's a little tangential to the notion of running the country, but so they're scandal essentially boils down to a, Barclays was the biggest, they have all these emails and stuff. They, the, the, the interbank offering rate is the percentage at which banks will lend each other money, lend each other money.

Speaker 7:          00:45:55       Right. And it's, there's trillions of dollars in the market that is indexed against that rate. Your home loan is probably indexed against it at some point. Right. But tons of markets trade on it. And to get that number, the banks call two guys and they report, yeah, we're, we're lending money at the 4.3 today. Great. All the banks call in and there's like an index of 20 of those numbers that are averaged out from all the banks. And what they did is they manipulated that rate. They colluded. They called each other. They would email each other and say, we need the Libor index number to go up by like a quarter of a percentage point. So they would all report numbers that were lower or higher than what they were lending money to each other on. It's convoluted. I know, but what it would do is it in a day they could bet against the rate, uh, the, the, the Libor number going up or going down so they can place bets on that, manipulate it themselves and in a day make millions upon millions of dollars just by manipulating this and with every manipulation your mortgage might go up, your credit score could go down.

Speaker 7:          00:46:46       Like it can affect so many things internationally. It's been for years. How long did they do this? It's been a, there's emails that show there's been going on for like 12 to 15 years, but there's some people that are saying it might have been going on in the early nineties and it was a total honor system reporting this number. There's no transparency. So all these banks got together and said, it'd be like they just decided we're all going to stay rich. Yeah, yeah. We're going to artificially inflate and deflate this number to manipulate the market to fuck with you, but it's going to give us millions and millions and millions of dollars and that's what they've been doing for years. That's when it's out in the open. And yet, I mean, Barclays got a slap on the wrist. They're like a hundred million dollar fine or three in a million dollar fine. That's nothing in comparison to what they made. That's the problem with punishments of these crimes. You talk about that guy in that dispensary is

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       probably going to go to jail for six months. Right. And get his next stepped on. These guys pay $300 million for making potentially trillions of dollars over the course of 15 years and no one does. Does any jail time or anything when, whenever there's big money, man, there's, there's big craziness now you know about this money mo problems or drew situation or doctor drew, uh, became a part of, uh, an investigation because they, who was it that, uh, doctor [inaudible] doctor drew [inaudible] settlement. What was the giant pharmaceutical settlement that just happened was several billion dollars. Was it Yasmin? Whatever, whatever it was. Doctor drew apparently was involved. Dr Drew was recommending certain drugs that they were asking him to recommend and they give him, they gave him $200,000, a $279,000, allegedly some, some somewhere in that range. Crazy to most doctors anyways. People, doctors are incentivized to sell certain drugs over other drugs.

Speaker 5:          00:48:25       Pharmaceutical companies do that all the time or send them on retreats. Yeah. But when you're a guy who's on TV, like recommend treatments and stuff and you're getting paid to recommend those treatments. Alley. Wow. That's a crazy blurry area. Cause it seems to me like they paid you to say some things you might not have said he's going to say. I wouldn't have said it if I didn't believe in the product and I, you know, I didn't believe in any of that. Money did not affect my opinion whatsoever. It didn't sway me one way, but that's tragic because I want to believe like Dr drew was one of those guys that he's not supposed to have any scandal. He was supposed to be the one good guy. Right. He was supposed to be the good guy. As long as his penis works well, it's very unlikely that he keeps it together.

Speaker 5:          00:49:07       He's a good guy, man. He really is. I've loved him. Every time I met him I be like, I want to believe you're real. I want to believe in your magic. Don't be a David Blaine on me. Well, his stance on marijuana is always were pretty silly. Yeah, we are. We are. We talked about it so much yesterday that we can't really go on. We had Tommy Chong on the podcast yesterday. Oh yeah, of course. Was massive amounts of weed talk shit. The question Joe, when he was talking about a heroin, did you think in your head, wow, that's really good. T tail and you know like it's like we said he didn't do it. It was really odd. Yeah. Chung or doctor drew, Tommy, Tommy Chong. I saw doctor drew tying off in a bathroom and you read it. If doctor drew said, listen, I shouldn't be talking shit about these drugs and until I do the mall, so it just goes on a show and that's his.

Speaker 5:          00:49:48       No doctor Juke gets high. See if doctor drew is the same guy after a month of Iowasca Ibogaine eating pot brownies and mushroom Dr Dress third eye every five days. Dr Drew would go on a cleansing ritual and eat nothing so much better than like supersize me 30 days. DMT and Kale. Good luck Dr drew. We'll see you on the outside every five days. He does a new trip and we do a whole season of this and in, in between he's doing yoga, he's eating really healthy. It's a $2 CPM right there. Definitely good show. It'd be awesome. Could you imagine if you could get a doctor drew to do all nonlethal psychedelic drugs if he agreed to it and he has to do with the octomom. Oh, now you fucked up to show that sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet. You can do that. Can you imagine the octomom like examining, did you guys, did you guys watch your porn?

Speaker 5:          00:50:40       I did. She had some nice and tight pussy. It was really, I didn't watch it. She couldn't, I didn't had no desire to. She either guide it really fixed, you know, or the babies came out that well but didn't she have like a ton about other kids are ready so none of her kids, I guess that's the whole thing just makes me incredibly sad. Tentacle train rape from Japan. No problem. But I don't want to see the Octomom Vagina tag Taggle train ray ban and the archive. That's like telling me Santa is not real. Fuck you. How dare you do this to me. I mean it is real. That's real. And that background casting couch is real as well. All that Shit's real. When I say it's real, it's not real. Rather. I mean it's magic. It's real. It exists. It's fucking, thank you for your imagined.

Speaker 5:          00:51:22       If that really became something you, you really wanted to actually be next to like if there was a real giant octopus thing that could fuck women and you would watch the whole thing, I would purposely go to Shibuya and take the yama know Tay Line in the hopes that I would see that tentacled monster. Yup. While it was just school girls line up on a bridge hoping the octopus chooses them weeping softly with pixelated genitals. There was a spot in the world where there was an octopus and it had like a hand of Dolos and it would just pick people up and fuck them in front of everybody. It turns out that's what the law, that's what the lochness monster really is. Just a bunch of Dick arms under the sea and anybody that happens to be snorkeling on by picks up Chapman and finger bags.

Speaker 5:          00:52:07       I mean that's, it sounds like a Japanese amusement park. It's no stranger than like lampreys that cling to the bottom of sharks and you know, eat the particles of food that they leave behind. You see the video of the clam today that was surrounded by salt and was using its clammy innards to move around a table and it looks like a, like a human tongue coming out of the, in between. Have you, can you pull that up? Do you have that? It's so bizarre looking and that's apparently how they navigate. They don't have eyes or nose or anything, so they use their tongue to sort of navigate around and then we boil them or steam those bitches, garlic on them. The delicious, so good. Gleaning clams. How great is it to be on the top of the food chain? It's pretty God damn good. That's why I liked that show.

Speaker 5:          00:52:46       Mountain men, it reminds me that we're on the top just waiting for this commercials. You were sort of show true channel. It's mount show mountain men. That's my new favorite show and like bearded prospect or types or three different dudes living in the mountains. One Dude lives in Alaska, leaves his family, goes on a Bush plane, flies three hours to his traps, and he runs his traps for three months. Just kills the kills little animals and comes back. I want to see the mountain man wrestle. This guy. Oh, this is the clam YTC this madness that they put the, they put the salt out so that it would move along the salt. Some, some people that said, yeah, that's what it's doing. Uh, this ain't real. You don't need this Israel? No, I don't. Oh, I want to in this.

Speaker 8:          00:53:26       This is as real to me as those 10 o'clock. I liking the way it's moving around around the, uh, if you're fleshlight did this, you'd be all about it. I'm not buying this. Look at that.

Speaker 1:          00:53:36       Yeah,

Speaker 8:          00:53:36       I dunno why, but what do you think it's a viral for Internet explorer 10. Like who's doing it? Has It? Is it a who would do a viral, like this is the optimum video. There it is. Clamps. So clams. They don't have to be in the water. They don't have to like, no, they do. They have to be in salt water. But you have to breathe yet. I mean this, this claim is dying. A slow death. You're watching, you're watching. It's last minutes. How long do you think it takes? This is by the way slash a clam snuff porn is a viable internet fetish. Yeah, it's pretty hot. Maybe it's real. Maybe it's real. I it seems fake to me. Does anybody on snuffy clients? I don't. Maybe maybe it is real. The salt on the table. It's pretty real. Like, like, like where that's the way it looked it up and then it was good. There wasn't a lot of pixelation around like the opening of the clam, which is a tell tale. Yeah. This just seemed fake. But what if that is true?

Speaker 5:          00:54:27       Bravo. Yeah. Love. Oh yeah, absolutely. Isn't that crazy? Now you can look at on video has gotten so good and so easily edited that you can look at anything you go that's probably fake. They're getting really close with game of Thrones with the animals. That's the first time like wolves looked like real walls cause they usually look so fake. It like blows the whole the whole thing. You know, if the fake animal, I can only dream wolves if I'm watching game of Thrones because I fall asleep. The moment that show comes on really cannot do it for me. I don't know. I just try, try. I was no snow. I got all excited and I put it on. I was like, here we go and I've heard of a doctor. I've heard that from many people that I heard is you just have to get through it.

Speaker 5:          00:55:00       Oh, you guys are crazy. But check this out and hook the first episode show. Look at this suck. This is going to freak you out. But if you guys haven't seen Black Mirror, that's what you guys need to watch. Look at this. It's going to freak out. This is a clam. Okay. Oh Wow. Oh that's real. Yeah, that's clammy park cooler right there. That's a clam. Moving around using this tongue to push around. What a shit. Life Clams, clams must've been really conti in the last life, but who knows? Maybe that clam is fucking loving life right now. That's what we used to call, like really country girls in Boston. It was tough, tough to call chicks cons back then. Kinda had a lot more power back then. If you call it the chicken cut back in 1980 you were ready to fight. You got to go to war.

Speaker 5:          00:55:39       So they weren't cones, they were clams. You know, it's like whenever a girl was really, because I grew up in New England, so whenever a girl was really shitty like Ah, she's a fucking clam. It was always a clam and it just like if you are claiming this life and came back as a clam and need just some shithead because you guys decided to start calling him that too, which is great because you have no, I mean like the Hitler, Hitler came back as a clam, you know, like you don't even deserve to be a person. But we also say happy as a clam. So maybe they're really loving them. No, they're just have a big watch, stupid face. So it looks like they're smiling when they open up. It looks like they're smiling. Yeah, that's what it is. It's not nearly as exciting. I like to believe that that claim is on a permanent trip right now. Maybe they are. Maybe they don't come until you eat them. Let's let's go crazy. That's the only

Speaker 7:          00:56:23       way to get us a clam off is to kill it. It's the best

Speaker 2:          00:56:26       thing for them is to be eating. That's when they're truly happy. Until that happens, they just, they try to find you. The only way they can give their love as if you eat them,

Speaker 7:          00:56:35       so you're a clam bake. Your clambake is one wild orgy and you have no idea. It's a mad, mad come session. Especially especially oysters. They don't come until you eat them. You've got to chew them and eat them. That's what they live and oysters, oysters. What? I don't like the taste. The ocean. We'll see things in a row real his last time you'd done squads last time guys, guys and arguments in a bar of Bro, you don't like oysters range your face. You laid off the power exercises. Since I've seen you. Have you backed off your clean completely out of the completely out of the gym rehabbing with Neon pink weights that are like three pound nylon weights at the gym. That sex just fucked my shoulder up hardcore. Yeah. Kevin a apparently got some dude to go a little bit. You go too crazy. And I went, I went in, so I got you. It was crazy. I put on 12 pounds in three and a half, four and a half weeks of like really like really dedicated supplements in everything, but just destroyed my entire body over the course of that.

Speaker 2:          00:57:32       Well you have to take it slow. If you haven't been lifting your whole life, then all sudden you're, you know, you're doing fucking dead lifts and squats and everything that he had a build up to stuff like that. And you were you doing? I'm always with a trainer, like with somebody always showing you how to do it right and make sure your posture is

Speaker 7:          00:57:48       the majority of the time. Yes. But my problem was that I would convince myself, even if I was collapsing and passing out, clearly I wasn't trying hard enough. Like I could, I could squat more or do more. So I got in my own head about it and

Speaker 2:          00:57:58       all that effort would have been so better spent like in Jujitsu or something.

Speaker 7:          00:58:02       Now realize that now I am just trying to get better so I can actually get into something that's more of a martial art. What is wrong with you? This is just hurt my shoulder. Like completely fucked it up and you get an MRI. They didn't do the MRI. They did the x ray and said that was good enough and I tried to explain, I don't think you can see what you need to see on it, but doing the Rehab I've, I've gotten better. Like I was just cleared to go back to the gym but it's been a long fucking process.

Speaker 2:          00:58:23       So you would just clear to be able to work out again. Do you have no more pain?

Speaker 7:          00:58:26       Yeah, no. I mean I have well it at that low weight high rep I'm, I'm pretty, I'm pretty okay now

Speaker 2:          00:58:30       there's an awesome shoulder exercise. Call the club bell and it's not a heavyweight exercise. I use 15 pound club bells. I use them. Yeah. And you know I've been doing it for a while and there's a lot of great exercises you can do with a 15 pack cause it's a really weird offset thing. Like there's dudes that use like 45 pounders. They're fucking savages. These like giant wrestler do to can do them with these huge ones. I can't fuck with those but 15 pounds, believe it or not. It seems like a lot a tiny metal.

Speaker 7:          00:58:57       But is it explosive over the head kind of or is it still on the plane

Speaker 2:          00:59:02       doing like these things called shield casting and all it is is like controlled movements of the shoulder and strengthens your joints. It's very good for sure.

Speaker 7:          00:59:10       Like if I did that with a fishing weight right now, I'd be okay. But anything, anything above like a watch battery, I'm going to destroy my shoulder just cause it's that it's still that sensitive to overhead movements. It sucks. Sucks of it. Did you, you need

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       to get an Mri man. You might have had, what is that guy doing? Is that some, is that what you're talking about? So something along those lines. But there's something about the background guy is that guy has a warming up before he holds a woman against her will. Yeah. That's all that is. It looks like a worker at lax when he goes home at night. You know like when the guys at flags and playing times. This is one that I,

Speaker 2:          00:59:44       dude, that's one of the club bell exercises that I do. He bells behind them. The club's behind him. Yeah. Those big ones are, that's like strong man type shit. That's like stuff that like, you know, like uh, you know like one of those Indian, if you ever seen like famous Indian wrestling, like India is known like for uh, developing like really powerful men and wrestlers really back.

Speaker 5:          01:00:06       I've only seen like the lady boys that do the pole dancing that run up the large wooden huts. Lady Boys. Man, I think that's pretty cool. And Rip. I wouldn't say that to their face to Joe, but to you, I just like lady boys. I remember I went to Cirque du Soleil, right?

Speaker 2:          01:00:20       Never felt more like a bitch, man. I worked for the UFC, but no one in the UFC has a build like these fucking guys. When you see dudes doing like a handstand holding another dude up in the air with one hand, you're like, wait a minute, get the fuck outta here. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:00:34       well 500,000 gallons of water poured on them from the ceiling and there's lights in their eyes and they're just holding it still costs and it's their third show that night. Like insane. I mean, they must be on roids. There's no way. There's no way he could do that and not all be just like Cirque de Solei Jewson pretty hardcore. You imagine you're like, you know what, I need drug testing in Cirque du Solei. I don't want to watch some juice heads holding each other up. I want to know it's disingenuine to the sport of acrobatic dancing. It's, it's the whole thing. It's wrong. It's not supposed to be about steroid and it's not fair. You and I want to compete on that level with them. We want to be served to answers but we don't want to have to juice. Yeah, that's not fair.

Speaker 2:          01:01:14       I mean you have to hold a lot of dudes over your head to get built. Like those guys. I'm not saying they juice cause you can't get that big without choosing. I had a friend who was a total that natural bodybuilder and he was fucking huge and you would swear that this guy did steroids. He never did anything. It's not 100% natural, just obsessed and worked out like a maniac and was enormous. But it is possible. Sure. It's just really hard to do. It's super hard to do. So most people assume, especially for certain body types, certain body tops, it's impossible. You know like extreme ectomorphs he ever met like really thin people with incredibly thin faith, thin hands. Those folks have a really hard time putting on weight and most of us are combinations of an ectomorph and endomorph you know, is a little bit of an, you know, a little bit of Meza more for sure were slight combination of people who are extreme ectomorphs like, man, those people were, that's a tough, it's tough to try to get strong. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:02:08       yeah. I don't know. I've, I feel like I wonder how much genetics plays into my own ability to to go down that path. You know, like, well for sure you went too hard to quote clearly. Yeah, clearly.

Speaker 7:          01:02:20       I mean I realize that this was completely my error, but I wonder dedicated doing it properly, how much change you can actually, you can actually,

Speaker 2:          01:02:27       you got to just cut to be healthy. You got to make sure that a lot of sleep, you've got to make sure you do the power exercises, but you've got to make sure before you do any of that. Then you build a base. Right now, if people that have

Speaker 7:          01:02:38       10 years of playing quake world competitively, it capture the flag. I thought that was enough of a base to get into the gym and going to beast mode, but it wasn't quake one capture the flight. I used to set up, I used to set up a tub. I don't know if I told you this before. I used to set up a tub of margarine next to my keyboard. I would get a loaf of fresh French bread on the way home and then it would get instant mashed potatoes with gravy and put that bowl next to it and so I would be playing team fortress or you know, wolf and Stein or doing whatever. I would sit down, play, click, click, click, break off bread, dip it in the margarine. Then dip that in the mashed potatoes and gravy and eat that. That was my dinner for weeks on end. Every day. God, you ruined your body. Oh Man. Bpay years, years, years and years.

Speaker 2:          01:03:19       Did you notice a difference in your body from that, from eating that?

Speaker 7:          01:03:22       Well, I mean there was no different, there was no nothing to compare it to because I was always a chubby kid. You know, like I was constantly eating and internetting that was my life. So now I have something to compare it to. Now it's, so now I want to swing it in that other direction, which is, so when you started to work out, did you just immediately dive into it? Fuck yeah, I got, it was, I was probably about 20, 21 years old when I was like, I need to change this. I lost a little bit of weight, but I was like, I need to change this. And so off of like three Google searches, I created the ultimate uh, ultimate workout regimen, which was nothing but a small piece of chicken and white rice for, you know, three times a day and running a, you know, two to three miles in the morning and two to three miles at night every single day for about six weeks and lost a shit ton of weight. Uh, got dangerously thin, developed a body image disorder, killed, killed my knees from running, running, running.

Speaker 2:          01:04:11       Did you have, did you kept saying the girls, you think I'm fat, don't you?

Speaker 7:          01:04:15       What? No, I would say that to like guys and chat rooms mostly. I'm like, what you would you fuck me IRL? Really Lol.

Speaker 2:          01:04:25       By the way, cut the show with the lol is we need not really lol.

Speaker 7:          01:04:28       Oh No. Yeah, yeah. That's a movie. No parking. Lol. But it's become a throwaway. It's becoming a, okay. That was amusing. Lol. But I'll go with her. Yeah, like a hand needs to be the lol. Like if you're really laughing out loud fucking mean it. Yes. This is my, this is my podium. I'm sorry. I don't know. He didn't make the show a platform. So you put together this, this godawful routine. So you just from youtube clips and from, it was just like googling, like literally like the how to get in shape. How to lose weight. Thing is folks,

Speaker 2:          01:04:56       if you really want to join, don't even join a gym. Okay. You really want to work out, make yourself work out at home, make yourself, cause if you really want to work out, you will fucking work out at home. Make yourself work out at home for one month. And if after one month you're still doing it, then waste your money on the gym. Yup. Because how many people join a fucking gym and then just never

Speaker 7:          01:05:13       and and if you join and try to quit, they make it the most impossible process.

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       It's like trying to quit the army. Go, fuck, you are locked for life a month. A month. Well you got to talk to Pat, the supervisor who gives you a form to fill out to mail to some place to get a confirmation. How about the creepiness where they actually like the take the money out of your, your account every month we had a debit. Yeah. I usually can't easily canceled my gym membership when my credit card expires. That's what just happened to be at la fitness. I was like, ah, it's got like six months left. I'll let it run out. It's going to be, it's going to be quite a week's worth of work to cancel it. I'll just let it go. If you have a wall in your house, you can get a workout. We've got the door. You've got a gym. Well for, for real if you, if you have a wall, because I would say if it's the only thing you need is you need to be able to prop your feet up on something so you can do handstand pushups.

Speaker 5:          01:06:02       Everything else you can do on the ground. You can do pushups in the ground. You can do tricep extensions. You could do like a form of dips with a chair. You know if you don't have a chair, go fuck yourself. Do there's chairs in the world. You can find a bench. If you can hear this podcast you can find a wall and a bench out in the world. Just be body weight squats. One of them, one of the biggest exercise I do, we've talked about it a bunch of times. It's Hindu squats. I do 200 of them. When I do my strength and conditioning workout, it's fucking brutal man. It's like I'm in pretty good shape. I do Jujitsu on a regular basis like kickbox on a regular basis. I stay in shape. I keep working out these 200 fucking body weight squats kicked my ass like almost nothing.

Speaker 5:          01:06:43       It's like, cause the first one is easy. The second one is easy. You hit 10 no problem. 20 I'm feeling it a little, but I, I can see the the finishing line and then once you get around a hundred you're like holy fuck where your knees are buckling and shaking like a seismic earthquake on the way down because their muscles can't do it. You've got a hundred ago, hundred ago. Oh. But it's a, it's an incredible workout for your legs. My legs have never been stronger. I feel like I'm on springs all the time. Like when I do my kickboxing workouts, I have much more power in my legs. My ability to move. It seems like, like a movies you're like, I can get away from things. It's like it's the real way to strengthen your legs the real ways. Not really like lifting giant shit over and over again.

Speaker 5:          01:07:25       That's puts so much pressure on your bag. Back joints, the real way to strengthen your legs, his body weight squats. It's crazy how good that shit works. We still like if you really want to get big, but squats really do work. You know, any, anything where you really load up on heavyweights and the dead lifts and stuff because even though body weight squats will strengthen your legs and make your legs a little bit bigger, they're never going to get, you're never going to get those ridiculous powerlifter thought. There was a moment where I thought, oh, that's what I want to go for, or that's, you know, that's, that's how lifter, yeah, like I like the power lifting physique and regimen because training in short bursts like that was really easy for me. Like I liked that notion of just give it all for five reps and you're done kind of thing. But now I realize I just need to be confident enough to leap over a puddle on the way out of my car. Like I don't have enough command of my body that I like. I play Frisbee and I'm like, I'm probably gonna Roll my ankle. I got to be careful now guys. Like it's that bad. I went golfing and my elbow hurt. Like, oh no.

Speaker 7:          01:08:15       Yeah. It's just the, you know, you don't need to

Speaker 2:          01:08:18       maintenance alone. I think it's, it's so important to work out just to keep everything moving and not atrophying. Cause you see certain people get to a certain age and like you look at them and then you look at some Jack Lane type character that just kept working out when he was at same age. Look how much more mobility. Yeah. It's almost like you're investing in making sure your car works cause they'll give your card doesn't work you fucking stranded. Well if your body starts to shut out when you're 40 or 50 or whatever that, that a lot of that can be avoided. And the way it could be avoid is to make sure you keep it up, keep it work and keep lifting weights. Keep going to the gym, keep eating right, keep working on your cardio. Just that's the have to do it. It's not, it's not an option.

Speaker 2:          01:08:58       Like for too many people it's like I'd like to give the gym but gosh, so the time it shit, you shouldn't even be living your life with that in consideration. It should be a staple. It should be a staple along with it. I mean you want to be healthy. I mean, you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want to do, but if you want to be healthy, you got to have your body healthy. I really believe that. I don't see how you can have like real happiness with an imbalance body about it's fucking up on. Yeah,

Speaker 7:          01:09:24       wholeheartedly agree. I mean, I think the key in life for everything is just balance, right? That's all it is. So your, your physical, your physical being and you're, you're, it's with you every day. It's your vehicle. It's your vessel. So how can you be balanced work and home life or whatever. If you're not balancing the physical portion of your bs going on hikes, smash, you're just going on a hike. You don't have to go to a gym. I used to go hiking when I lived in Colorado. Man, fucking hikes will kick your ass, man. Especially at altitude, you know, you're walking up the side of a hill. That's a, that's a real workout. It's a nice cardiovascular workout. You feel good when it's over. Your body's designed to do it. Years and years and years of programming, you're hungry or some dudes love cutting

Speaker 2:          01:10:03       Woodman. You know, I remember George Foreman was the first fighter that I ever saw that we would cut wood as a part of his workouts because back then when people were lifting weights, it's like a lot of fighters didn't lift weights back then. And like, especially like in the 1980s like nobody ever really lifted weights. When Mike Tyson came along, Mike Tyson had a crazy physique, but when most people don't know it was all chin ups and push ups and he, he was just a thick dude, a thick dude who was in impeccable condition and he really wasn't like a big weightlifter. But then Evander Holyfield came along and Evander Holyfield was the first guy that show that there's benefits to lifting weights because all those guys, before then, they were all trained in, you know, they would do like a bodybuilding workout and then they go to the gym and they couldn't move their arms because they were sore and they'd get beat up. So the trainer would tell them, oh hey, I had fucking away left and shut you down. She go to your dad's rap and it's, that's not what it is. Is the Guy Sore? You know it's going to make you faster for sure. We know that now

Speaker 7:          01:11:01       if you're used to throwing an extra hundred pounds without arm, when you're not throwing it to get to go a little faster, it's going to hit a little harder. But the olden days, man, but splitting wood, that's a brilliant, I like, I see the crossfit stuff where they're pushing tut tires, uphills,

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       forming these higher workout pulled trucks. He would pull a rather a jeep. He would our jeep behind him. He would push it and pull it. It's strapped himself to thing and nobody else was doing that. Back then when George Foreman was doing that, he was doing crazy shit. I remember a braiding the fat from the meat when you grill it. That's the kind of crazy shit for him was up to do that. I don't even know grill. Well, I know his grill. Yeah. What I'm saying. I don't think you use that, but I'm saying that's how ingenious he is. Man. That dude made a ton of money off way more than getting punched in the face. Man made a lot more money off of a plastic dorm, you know, like chicken and steak cooker. He was punched in the face. Amazing human being. Would he accomplish was very rare when he was 36 years old after like he got beat up by Muhammad Ali in Africa and it was the most humiliating defeat.

Speaker 2:          01:12:00       It just, he wasn't the same after that and he fought. He fought Ron Lyle is, that would be fine if I can take a step back. Was he expected to win at all? Oh, he was. They thought it was, this is fight. The fight was such a one sided mismatch and most people's eyes that hunter s Thompson flew to Africa and didn't go to the fight. Instead he took acid and war and Nixon mask. It's swimming around in the pool and it was a huge disaster for hunters career because he was supposed to turn this story into rolling stone. Muhammad Ali winds up beating George Foreman and he wasn't even there. He started in the shallow, he missed the entire fight. So Ali just ran a class on it. Like you could say, hey man, can you guys give me a USB drive so I could actually watch the fight and my job and tell the story.

Speaker 2:          01:12:38       He couldn't even do that because there was nothing. So hunter had, there was a huge failure because he was in Muhammad Ali fan and he didn't want to watch Muhammad Ali get destroyed. Even Muhammad Ali fans didn't want to watch that fight because Ali was in the twilight of his career. He had taken those three years off and really was never the same guy again. He was never the same as when he was before they took the title away from him. When he came back, he, he became more of a guy would stand in front of you and take punches until you got tired, then be, you know, rope, a dope strategy, which news on format. And after foreman, after Frazier had dropped him and Frazier beat him. And, uh, the, uh, the first fight to sort of unify the title after that, most people thought that Muhammad Ali was just, he was just not quite as good as it used to be and sort of a step down and he was slowly starting to fade away. So George Foreman beat the fucking shit out of Joe Frazier. I mean, it was a brutal Kao and was one of those brutal chaos where he hit foreman or foreman rather hit Frazier and picked him up in the air with his punch. She did like a little skip the superman punch out star appears above his head. Cool. Brian pulled it up because it's so weird. But pull up form versus Frazier. Kao It's, Oh, another run time ever. No problem. Hey, don't worry about it. This is a says the power's off. Brian's this power thing.

Speaker 2:          01:14:02       This podcast is brought to you by technology. There it goes. Alright, it's charging now. Anyway, he hit Frazier

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       and he hit him so fucking hard. Is this the whole fight or just the chaos

Speaker 1:          01:14:16       dilemma?

Speaker 5:          01:14:18       Oh, the wolves are beating the Pistons. That sucks. This was 1960 on. I'd be surprised if we wanted to. Now you got to watch how hard for him and Pitsa.

Speaker 1:          01:14:28       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:14:33       And Joe Frazier, by the way, tagged for him and a bunch of times Joe Frazier is a bad motherfucker.

Speaker 1:          01:14:38       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:14:43       it's weird watching these guys as, yeah. He needs to take him to the ground. He's losing, he's losing the standup game.

Speaker 1:          01:14:49       Right. You're right. But that gap

Speaker 5:          01:14:52       to Frazier is such a crazy style is bobbing and weaving winging punches. You know, all I can think of is the damage that's done with each little tap to the brain. Oh yeah. Here's one foreman starts landing on him. Look at Harvey is, he hits so hard, he hits you, just changes everything. He would wait to throw his whole body into it. There's so much power in his punches and he was a good boxer to a surprisingly good boxer. Like the reason why like he was able to land those punches. He was very unorthodox in the way he would box. He was like push guys off a lot. See how he's doing that? Just pawn and Matt, he's pushing them away from me. Don't get it inside and then he would, he would plot at you with a jab, but then when he knew that you were going to be there, that's when he would win the big ones like right there. See most of them were short punches. Like his jab is a nice door, Jeff. There's the uppercut. Oof. But watch when he gets up, foreman had ridiculous power, man. Watch how hard he hit when he gets up.

Speaker 5:          01:15:56       He's literally going to go in the air. Watch this shit. Ooh, look at this. I saw him. I saw him go for it right there. God, he's winging punches at him. Oh Nice. Jack. Set up the whole body behind it. Yeah. That jab is a fucking fence. Posts they rented, rented the body, getting telephone pulled in the face and that was his big weapon as he got older to just slowly but surely just chipping away at Joe Frazier. It's like car accident gooeys and the speed. So smart, but the way he's boxing is so smart. Just keeping them off of the jam. I just see more than the hooks and look at there's the shot. Oh my God, that upper cut was bad and there's boom, look at that one. Oh Jesus. There went his first bike ride. Oh, there. When his first date, oh my God, there went his ability to control his bowels. That upper cut was incredible. They're going to keep this fight going. They didn't give a fuck in the 70s did you want to get up son? Put up your dukes. That's amazing. The watch this. Oh, oh, that's it. Here we go. Now to continues, dude, are you kidding me? I mean, how hard

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       is that guy hit sweet prints. So coming out of this fight, everybody thought, you know what? This guy's going to kill him. He's going to kill Ali. Like what did he do to Frazier? He did that to Joe Frazier. That's what does that one round or two rounds the first round, I think as a first round. So if he did that to Frazier, what the fuck is he going to do? He's going to steamroll stands in front of guys. He takes shots. He's got this rope, a dope style, and he's three years coming back. Okay. He wrote it up the fuck out of George Foreman stopped. Did you ever see the stoppage? I'll pull that up to pull up an Aldi chaos foreman cause it was beautiful. It's one of the greatest moments in the history of sports. Nobody thought it was going to win. Nobody thought I was getting.

Speaker 2:          01:17:49       When he goes to Africa, he's dancing and yell and he's got the whole crowd going. [inaudible] boom. By yet telling him like Ali, kill him. The whole crowd is saying Ali kill him. Jesus, he's got everybody convinced that George Foreman is a fake and he's with the white man. She's fucking, he just, he tortured him, he tortured them and then when he got into the ring man, he just fucking boxed him up, boxed him up, moved around tired amount. Then when he finally got, I'm tired and he connected top dome and another right hand and put form in a way, and it was crazy. Nobody believed it. Nobody believed people were going nuts. People in America were fucking screaming and jumping in the streets because he foreman represented something really scary, this big crazy black dude. Or walked around with German shepherds.

Speaker 9:          01:18:32       This is the chaos. Was that it right there? Yeah. Pull it, pull it back so you can see it. So for eight rounds,

Speaker 2:          01:18:38       he beat the shit out of Muhammad Ali. Dude for eight rounds. This is the end of the fight. It looks like he's just

Speaker 9:          01:18:45       and arms out there that has done the clean and then look at this. There's the distance. I love that music too. That's fantastic. Where is blitz? Is that from a Ali's documentary? No, when we were kings. This is a Bruce splits creation according to the watermark on the youtube video. Yeah. Oh, Bruce splits creation. Thanks Bruce Bloods. Bruce credits you fucking savage. So that's why everybody was going crazy. They didn't Tim.

Speaker 2:          01:19:14       Yeah, it was, uh, it was the beginning of the end of Huna. Rez Thompson's literary career. He started kind of falling apart after that and became crazier and crazier, unfortunately. And you said it, that was the, that was sort of the beginning of the end for four minutes. Well, yeah, yeah. That was when foreman had one more fight after that. And I think he fought Ron Lyle. I think that's what we fought. But they had this crazy back and forth, fucking crazy war and uh, he got knocked down a couple of times and just wasn't the same. George Foreman, like I'll lead, took it from him. So then he retired and then he became this priest and he became a preacher and found God's word and got fat as fuck. And then at 36 years of age, I think you'd be not a fighting for 10 years. I think that's how long you've been out.

Speaker 2:          01:19:54       He just decides 300 plus pounds fat as fuck decides is going to make a comeback. And I remember reading about it and being in a boxing fan going, oh wow, he's going to make it come back. That's crazy. Yeah. Good luck. That's all. I was, come on George Foreman in the modern era. He's a giant fat guy and then all of a sudden he just like kept losing weight and he kept beating people. And then he got to Jerry coat, uh, not cherry coat. Sia, Gerry Cooney, he got to Gerry Cooney and beat the fucking shit out of Gerry Cooney. Pull that up. Ryan pull Blah George Foreman. Kaos Gerry Cooney. I love Youtube. It's amazing. It's so credible.

Speaker 3:          01:20:30       All on demand. Yeah. Edited and you can get the dubstep remix of that fight. Actually pulled that one up with

Speaker 2:          01:20:36       when George Foreman Kao Gerry Cooney, I think he was in his forties. I'm pretty sure he was in his forties. And uh, he, he was the oldest man to win the heavyweight title. He was 46 when he knocked out Michael Moore and Michael Moore was a fucking stud. He was a really good boxer form and hit him with one of those canned hams, those giant fucking fists of his, it's just a hard for me to watch. Like I respect

Speaker 3:          01:20:58       boxing highlights when they're from the time where MMA didn't exist because, because now you know, you look at it and go, okay, well that's, that's impressive again, because that was the sport and that was, they were the best at it. But nowadays, like the boxing has completely lost any ounce of appeal for me. Just has, I prefer,

Speaker 2:          01:21:14       um, quite honestly I prefer MMA to everything, but I do like stand up fighting only. I do still like that. I prefer kickboxing. I like, I'm sure you know what it's showtime. Has He ever watch it? Showtime. They just sold themselves to golden glory. So now it's just called glory. That's the, the, the new, uh, they, they combined forces, they bought them out. Is it all like a k one or it's just like be better than cable. It's going to be the best fighters. It's all the, cause. Th Th the k one organization after a while, stop paying people and they would, they, they had money problems for a while and then a new company bought them out and then they did a may show. They did a show in May and people didn't get paid from that either. Not Everybody got paid like the big guys got paid, so it showtime and glory decided to get together, but most people in America don't even know how fucking bad ass kickboxing is.

Speaker 2:          01:22:01       Like real boxing. I mean, we got used to that PKA karate shit in the 80s which was quite honestly, I mean it was a lot of fun. I enjoyed it. There's a lot of very good fighters, you know, that that came out of that, you know, that actually, you know, tennis Alexio and the guys who are really good fighters. But the style wasn't that exciting. I mean, you'd make people, they had to like kick like eight times and around. Otherwise, you know, they'd get penalized because most people, it's just like sloppy box. This is nothing like that. This is incredibly technical point in time.

Speaker 9:          01:22:29       Yeah. Look at this. Gerry Cooney and George Foreman, I believe he's in his forties here. Look at this. Gerry Cooney had challenged for the title at one point in time. He fought Larry Holmes. He was a murderous puncher, knocked out Ken Norton and one of the most vicious knockouts ever. A ruthless Naca. He Could Bang Matt's big fucking White Guy. But George woman also open, he opened a lot of people's eyes with, oh well he could take Cooney's punches to look at. Oh, look at that one too. Boodle brewed. Oh God. Damn. George Foreman was a bad motherfucker. What a combination, man. Get up. Go in Benjamin. He's getting up. How tough is Gerry Cooney? He's getting up after that. He's going to keep going. Did she know you ain't okay? Never been clocked like that. Look at this. Look at this. Oh one side. Just step in uppercut. Brian, please rewind that. Just rewind a second one. We won the second part again. Oh, that was, this is Gloria. So look at this upper cut. Boom. He, he didn't need to follow up. Even need the follow up. We just wanted him to hit him. George Foreman, stepson, left upper cuts him steps to it. Right,

Speaker 2:          01:23:40       right and right. Handsome. He was a, he was a really underrated boxer, man. He said he, that guy was a, you know, a really, really interesting fighter. But Muhammad Ali, he took his soul in Zaire. But how was his ground game? Um, yeah, his ground game was probably about like James, Tony's. That's so good. That's so good. You know, they all could develop a ground game. Anybody can develop this round game. All you have to do is put it in the time. It's a problem is when you go there, you're going to feel like a bitch. You know, you just gotta be able to do that because a lot of people have a distorted perception of how well they could defend themselves. And you know, you get in there your role, like I, my friend Cade weighs 140 pounds and I'm not bullshitting. He might wait one 45 he's very slight.

Speaker 2:          01:24:22       It's very thin, but he's a black belt in Jujitsu, you know, and I am, I'm 50 pounds fucking heavier than him. But if I roll with him, I got to watch what I'm doing cause he'll fucking slap a triangle. I mean, I'll go unconscious. I mean that's just, that's the reality of MMA as opposed to, you know, to boxing is that, you know, in, in, in a, in a boxing match, the fact that you're not going to ever see that he never going to see a guy slap a triangle and a guy in the middle of a fight, right? And Oh shit, he locked it in. You're missing half the fun. You're, you're, you're, you're only going to be able to hit guys. It's great to hit guys. I love watching a fight. We're two dudes throw blows and there were,

Speaker 7:          01:24:59       right. But I just think it's, it's chess versus checkers. Like, and I'm not, I'm not downplaying the nuance of the boxing game, but there are so many more outcomes. You have to factor in every single millisecond. You're in an Nma match with someone versus a boxing. That is true. Your button has to keep that in.

Speaker 2:          01:25:13       You never see the high level striking in MMA that you see in like glory and k one you don't see it. You don't see it at that level. They're just not as though they're not as good. And one of the reasons why they're not as good is because they also have to factor in take down attempts. Right? So they have to change their stance a little bit and they have to there they have to constantly be thinking about like if they throw a kick, they're going to get taken down and they might lose the round. The guy gets on top of 'em there might not be able to submit them. There's some, when you don't have to think about any take downs, then do. It can really shoot you. Really the punchline and some of the punching and kicking is so exciting and kickboxing, man.

Speaker 2:          01:25:51       See I, that's my favorite shit to watch when I watched dude's leg kicking dudes and fucking flying knee and each other in the face and dropping elbows on each other. I mean it's so wild. Like how good some of the best guys are. It's just pure stand up and an MMA. It's real hard to get to dudes that good at standup who also have good ground game. Right. You know, it's cause usually when you get to a guy like at Giorgio Petrosyan who's like a multiple time world champion, one of the best fighters in the world, Georgia Petrosian is a straight kick boxer. That's all that guy does and he's the fucking best and he fucks guys up that are like really high level world champions, figures out their game and you can't do that if you're also taking Jujitsu class. You can't do that if you're also, you know, uh, trying to put on weight because there's a, you know, 175, 170 pound division and the next way class has one 85 right? So you got to figure out what the fuck to do either dehydrate yourself or puts a mass on. You don't have to do that. And we kickboxing you just fight it, whatever the fuck away class you are. There's a lot of weight classes and glory is that, that's a new organization. It's both golden glory formed glory and glory is a kickbox and organization they've already had. I know they've already had at least one show, but fucking high level kickboxing to me is like one of the most fun things to watch. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:27:04       Well I got to recommend something to you. Actually. It's, it's Tangental, but I just don't want to forget too. I love it.

Speaker 2:          01:27:08       You've used the term tangental twice as podcast, which is more than I've ever used it in life suite. It's a great words. I love that word. It's fantastic. I wouldn't mind, I might use it in a, um, uh, something I wrote, but I would have to look it up to make sure he's using it right. No, I don't want to fuck it up. No, you'll be all right.

Speaker 7:          01:27:26       Anytime, anytime you want to go off on a tangent. I apologize and gentle. What is the chant? Tangental points? It's was just recommended to me recently. It's a BBC, like a mini series, three 40 minute episodes called a black mirror and it deals with the sort of near futuristic societal issues that will come about because of the ever evolving pace of technology and how it gets intrusive into our lives. It's brilliantly shot, directed, edited. It's one of the best things I've seen in a long fucking time. A black man called black mirror. It's, there's three episodes and I, I'm hesitant and reluctant to speak about it any further because I don't want to spoil anything like each. It's a BBC. I think it was done for the BBC. No, it was a, it was like a three re tweeting it. That's why I'm going to let to get three up, three mini series or three episodes, three mini series. I guess they're like 40 minute episodes. They're phenomenal. I cannot recommend them enough. I've been showing them to everybody that it's beautiful. I haven't been, I can't believe they haven't aired over here yet. I think they aired in India and the UK and that was just stupid. It's, it's beautiful. Um, I, that is a gorgeous mirror as well. That sat in mirror is phenomenal. Look at the depth of that. Why are you looking at a mirror? I, it's what came up.

Speaker 7:          01:28:42       He was looking up, sat in black cock. The moment I tight black, the suggestions are cock mouth, glory hole. It's weird. Brian's computer. This suggests all these weird things I was searching for Benihanas and it popped up, boot cocky right away.

Speaker 2:          01:28:58       BBC miniseries on future technology recommended

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       by Kevin.

Speaker 3:          01:29:03       It's amazing. Well, I guess we can kind of dip into one which was, you know, the, the, the Google glasses you've seen as likable glass. So the notion of having every moment recorded of all the time, all the time, what that's going to lead to, people have been like, oh, it's going to lead to freedom and democracy and whatever. I never really gave much thought of it in a, like the context of a relationship. And a couple of gets in an argument where someone says, well, you said something a certain way a little while ago. I'm trying not to spoil things. And the guy goes, oh, did I, let's look at the tape. And then they're both going back and analyzing the argument, which causes them to analyze other things and it causes them to go, you know, there's, there's even the notion of, of of children suing their parents over decreased, uh, like wages in the future because they didn't show enough support during a tee ball game or whatever when they were younger. Like the notion that that could resist, it could exist in a near future because of the pace of technology is mindblowing.

Speaker 4:          01:29:56       Yeah. You imagine if you could sue your parents cause they did a shit job of raising you. Like go back and show the evidence and your father was millionaire bank dude and just didn't spend any time you exhibit 47 where you didn't love me. Let's go through and here it is. Let's show this is the first time that I missed the party. This is how he treated me. I was too. Right. You can relate to that. That's coming right. Has it has absolutely happened. Yeah. This, this whole thing is not going to, it's not like it's going to stop this, this intrusion, this integration, this symbiotic relationship that we have with the machine.

Speaker 3:          01:30:29       Yeah, that's, that's fair. Like the, the intrusion part is where like now most people don't see it as an intrusion at all. They're happily adopting.

Speaker 4:          01:30:35       It seems like it. I think it's going to be, the situation's going to be, that's just what life is and it's not going to be an intrusion. It's just there's not going to be privacy anymore. It's going to, it's going to come to that.

Speaker 3:          01:30:45       Well, I think there'll be privacy for those who can afford it. You know, there's going to be a percentage of the, of society that has enough money to hide what they're doing or make what they're doing legal and oppress others. I want to be friends with them. Yeah. By the way, that we're all good. We're rapidly climbing that mountain man. Your clothes

Speaker 4:          01:31:01       need to get join a country club or something and they start a super pac. So they like me and they'll tell me when they were about to make shit go down.

Speaker 3:          01:31:08       Don't go to the twin towers were playing golf. By the way, that black mirror is a channel for not BBC. My apologies. It's still brilliant. Oh, it's channel four. Yeah. Oh, you son of a bitch. Where you that specific with it? Oh, I just, you know, just tell people to being black mirror and then they'll laugh at you for using bang. That's true. Fucking spider man or man or man, did you like that movie? I had to tweet it. I was like that. That really ruined my suspension of disbelief. Like here, I'm supposed to believe this kid is like crazy inventor and he lives in a world where people can hand 3d vector models to each other and there's crazy high end technology everywhere and yet he's using bing. I don't think sending that don't even get me started. And then that tablet, what do you think about that tablet, that new surface?

Speaker 3:          01:31:53       Well, I actually, I don't know. I don't know. I'm not, I'm not too mad at the surface. I got to use it before I really see how it goes. You know, at the tech specs look good. I mean they're, they're trying something. It was funny to watch them try to present a product like apple though and I don't think they have their presentation shops down. It froze up and froze up and then the guy's like, yeah, and then like twice, like twice you can pull it up and this guy that was selling a case for it is like this case is the finest leather, like a luxury costs steering wheel like you would find on a luxury automobile. That's the leather Alcon. You would a sign on my cock strap right now. It's my Louis d string.

Speaker 3:          01:32:34       I cinch my balls with Butan fineness, murdered beasts. We cut the throat when they were young. We personally personally clubbed each of these baby minks is here. That's what they're saying. If you are soft balls of a child, eight, to be fair, this software is in Beta and so that's probably why he froze up. But you don't want it. Don't do a presentation unless it's going to be solid. Apple's really great at that. Not that they haven't fucked up too, but have a great experience just with all the, with browsing and just 10.6 this guy is just, he's hearing the email, it's going to be sent to him about his job termination as he's definitely, and of course people play games. I can go and play any of the interesting games that were on in the windows store right now. It's like freezing. I can play the game. Hide the surface. Yeah. So no one can see it froze for all of those and then the camera zooms in like right, right. It. That's the worst part of it, you know? It looks great. My child's college fund now as a combat. I won't see it again. Yeah. Now why is the camera, would you switch? Don't excuse me just a second. Hold on one second.

Speaker 3:          01:33:45       We're going to talk about this or a company retreats. Wait a minute. When did they just put it back and get another one? Which Kudos on that producer. We're having another one ready to run. They must have had 40 back there just in case this buggy piece of shits about fuck up in the middle of my presentation. Man, poor guy, he must was sweating and he tried to like play it off to, you got to talk about it. You've got to go listen, we're going to stop that from happening. Yeah. Pay No attention to the crashing on the surfaces. Silly. So silly like crashed. Yeah. So it's that, but I don't, I'm not mad at the product. I just, they got to try something. I think it is Amazon making a smart phones. Interesting. I think design wise, it's just, you know like when you sit first of all the iPad and you're just like, wow, that thing's sexy as fuck.

Speaker 3:          01:34:27       You know? And this kind of just seems to us, I don't know it Matt. It just looked boring. It looked kind of like, yeah, this would have been an awesome three years ago. Do you know that they're coming out with a small iPad that's the next move. Yeah. Yeah. They're making a note and they're making the note bigger is what is the latest I've Sam. So the next model of notes actually going to be a little bit bigger to kind of compete with the next iPad. IPAD. Supposed to have a phone attached to it. No, but you either should the note, I mean you can use it as a phone, I guess. Uh, probably they're really trying to bill it but wouldn't you want it

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       to be able to do everything if the note could do everything but the, I kept my, I couldn't make calls that would annoy me. Well, I mean your iPad now can make calls if you Skype, Skype or voip. It skyping people like some fucking hack or savage who is an APP? I think it's pretty, I didn't grandparents are skyping at this point, I think. I don't think that any of the elite hacks or is out there are booting up Skype. Do you have to afford Geeta Skype or King's Canyon and so you could come up with three g? Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. How weird is that? It's great. When you actually going to be what phone calls are. It's like you just need an internet connection mean. That's to an extent. That's what they are now. It's just, you know, instead of Skype, you're using their cellular tower. It's just converting your voice to packets and beaming it around the planet.

Speaker 5:          01:35:35       Again, why I like mountain men, right? Marty gets in his plane and he flies three hours up in for the Alaska wilderness. There's nobody up there that poor fuck. He has to take a bath in a a a look like it has to heat up water and like a garbage can. Does he have a tumbler? Does he have a tumbler? Yeah. What's it? Am I supposed to care if he doesn't have a tumbler? I'm not interested. I don't know what a tumbler is. What's his Twitter does they have a Twitter flicker and bill or one of those things? Yeah, those plugs, those tumblers. It's like where people went when they got off of my space. It's like I need somewhere to go and express myself and it really annoying way. It's actually where I think where people are getting off to go from Facebook now and need to park.

Speaker 5:          01:36:11       Yeah. A lot of people. That's humbling. Really. Yeah. I mean it gives you that sort of personalization and all that madness. The Facebook thing is crazy. I think the less indulgent people are allowed to be the better. So when you're allowed animated Gif files and all that, she don't like my glitter graphics say, define me as a human being. I want to embed 40 songs on a page with some glitter and that defines me. People for years wanted a way to define the type of person that's instantly defined when they have a glitter tag on their myspace page for years. It's like, you know, they're not retarded, but like did dare fucking weird. Like it's like they tell you that like something and you're like, come on, read the guys who have that jam. Stir frog is the ring tone. I'm like, I see those commercials.

Speaker 5:          01:36:54       And I'm like, so what is selling that ringtone to people? Before the ringtones, man, you couldn't describe a guy like that before. They were gluing tags. You would, you would go, well she's just weird. And then log it sounds like you're an asshole with axe body spray though. I mean it's the same with your card in the war. That whole Bot might father wears a whole bottle of that and to this like he has no scent glands. So when he comes to my house, like I've had people come up, I've had people come over to my house, no shit. And three days after my dad has visited, they say your house reeks of knock off Portuguese TrueCar. And that's my old man. Which he spray. No, no. It's like it's, it's like the chill water. He uses the knock off cool water. Like literally I got some of that when I was a kid. I remember putting it on him. I love him. This is really what I have to do to get laid. I don't know if I'm kind of all through with this. Can I get you get them out and doing their ditto if I, if I may, that'd be great. Thank you sir. You have such congrats and a half on every time I visit you. There's a new setup. Wait till you soon. We're going to be in low earth orbit recording the podcasts like this is so good.

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       We're branching out. So happy for both of you. Congrats. Thank you. We're having a good time, man. We've been, uh, doing a lot of comedy shows here at the icehouse too. We're doing one, uh, saw that Wednesday night for folks who are interested. It's picking up pace as we speak right now. Committed to the show. This is what we're going to be one of our Wednesday night super shows don. My errors in Greg Fitzsimmons is in an Ari Shaffir is so just write their son. Get the fuck out of it.

Speaker 7:          01:38:23       Greg was, so I asked him to be a part of the first lead up that we threw at at club Nokia.

Speaker 2:          01:38:29       Got an email. So Fis, what? Explain to the ladies and gentlemen again to don't know what a lead up

Speaker 7:          01:38:34       a lead up. Yeah. Well, I mean we created it on a whim this year. It's a, it's supposed to be and sort of is a nerd carnival. So the idea is, Eh, there's experiential zones that you can have like an old school arcade or cosplay or modeling with with earth magnets and Bucky balls and just random shit going on on the show floor. And then on stage we do a sort of variety show. So there's a podcast taping, there's VJ, Mike relm. I'm going to come out and jam with them on this tour. We're taking it to 10 cities at the end of this year, taking it around. Uh, we're announcing the dates next Tuesday and the location

Speaker 2:          01:39:06       around California. Uh, yeah, I think, well we don't have to fly anywhere. Not For this one. I Portland's the closest, but we'll fly out. We'll happily fly out and put you up and you can do a show or take your podcasts during it if you want. You know, if I could figure out a way to book a show that night, absolutely worth my while to go. Absolutely. I think a fun thing would be to do, we've thought about doing live podcasts before and we might do that, but I think one thing that would be really fun to do is do half alive podcasts, half alive Q and a session. So we could fuck around and podcasts if we'd like. But I would like it if people could just line up and ask his question.

Speaker 7:          01:39:44       Right. We built that into, to lead up. Like the idea is that so many people do live podcasts on stage and you show up and you just watch somebody talk and that's it. And I'm like, but you're there, you're physically there. There needs to be interaction with the audience. So we play games with them, we give out prizes, we do Q and A's and I used to do, Qa

Speaker 2:          01:39:59       is the end of all my comedy shows. That's awesome. But it became too much. The same questions. Really too much.

Speaker 7:          01:40:09       Please, if you go to Joe's live podcast taping, make sure those are the only questions you shout out.

Speaker 2:          01:40:13       That's all it is. Too late. They got me. Um, which, you know, it's not bad, but I would say like, yeah, you should probably youtube it. You get it, you'll get a better, you know, there's plenty of descriptions of it on Youtube, listening to them talk about it. Sure. Especially, you know the,

Speaker 7:          01:40:27       there's great videos of you talking about it, you know, you can, you can see that.

Speaker 2:          01:40:31       But it was sometimes it's fun though. I still do it sometimes, but I used to do it after every show. But it's hard to close strong when you do that. Especially cause I would, I wouldn't want to say no to no more questions. So the questions would go on for sometimes hours. I've done, I've done like an hour of comedy than an hour and a half more of Q and. A. I've done that more than once. And after awhile I was like, people like, let me go, dude, I want to get out of here. I'm tired of you talking,

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       you know. So I, I cut it way back to I want, I like to do like between an hour and 10 and no more than an hour and a half and just go fucking balls out, you know? And then as for Q and a, I just talked to people, that's my new thing is go outside and meet everybody. If you've got a question I'll answer it. But the yelling out like on stage like that, it's like it's, I think it would be cool if it was a show of only Qa. Like that's what was expected. You know, like people would be able to and they would be able to get up to a microphone and ask like when we did it at the end with my special, yeah, there was, there was a bunch of really funny ones that we did from the end of a, not my special from Atlanta that we just did, but my one from before from Columbus, Ohio, w one of the funniest parts of special was talking to people afterwards.

Speaker 4:          01:41:38       Like ask the step up to the microphones to have ridiculous questions, you know, but it's hard to close on those. It's hard to count that one of these is going to be good enough to cause if he could have an awesome show, but if like the end of its sucks, people remember the end of it. Oh sure. You got to book end it start off big and big. That's it. Killing for an hour and a half and have the last five minutes eat a dick and the show sucked. Well if you did that, if you ate a dick on stage, I think that's quite a closer. It depends on whose Dick, right? Sure. Yeah. Sure. Did you hear about the Japanese kind of that he served his own penis. He decided that he was asexual. So we had this, what am I going to do with this thing? It's $250 a plate.

Speaker 4:          01:42:21       Wow. And the uh, had all these people come over and he cooked his dick. He cooked his dick with mushrooms and yeah, I would love to see the Yelp reviews for that. He showed his dick in the bag. He had his dick surgically removed. Wow. First of all, the fact that he found a doctor that's willing to cut his fucking junk off and then give it to him so he could cook it like, Holy Shit, and I don't know who the fuck you think you are, but the fact that you think you could just cut your Dick and balls off and not miss them. I think that's silly beyond belief.

Speaker 7:          01:42:52       That's why when I like, have you seen that you've seen the BME paint Olympics video, right? Where the guy's got his balls in a mason jar filled with angry hornets and he's just shaking it around. Come on boys, get at me. Get the Stinger in me like that is insane to me. People are, God damn crazy insane to me.

Speaker 4:          01:43:07       So glad they fixed the AC. Does it work? Do you think it works? It doesn't seem like it works.

Speaker 7:          01:43:15       This is right here. It feels cool. And we're going into some of the beak from Yoga. Yeah, we need to, we have to think about that. We found a doctor when we first launched attack of the show. It's one of my favorite segments that only six people saw cause nobody watched our show when we first launched it. But that launch week we did some crazy shit and one of them was someone yelled across the office, they're like, your ass got served. Like oh okay. And we went, wait, could you serve a webpage out of someone's ass hole? And we did the research and sure enough you can, we've got a little USB web server thumb drive. We registered your ass, got served.com slipped it into a condom and on live television put it in a coworker's asshole and fired up web server in

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       his colon and you could go live to his asshole and leave a message on his wall, which was like, you know, scrolling on his colon and he existed. I was, it was crazy. It was amazing. We got away with that on live TV. Did you show? We had him behind a screen silhouetted like ace Ventura Style and the doctor went back there and be modulated his voice. But I was standing right next to it with me. The little microphone. Oh, it was brilliant. Your ascots or that's hilarious. Yeah, it was awesome. Too Bad. Six people saw it. Oh, I saw it. Well thank you. Yeah, because I can find five more. We can have a reunion special. That was the beauty of wheat. That was the beauty of DVR because that was one of the few shows, a tackle the show that I enjoyed. Kind of like watching the news almost every day.

Speaker 3:          01:44:33       I know it was kept up the day and then stuff like that. So I, I mean I might've had like 20 episodes at a time and only watch like seven or eight of them. I'll take that. But I always, you know, it was a fun show man, and I really liked how it progressed and I was actually really sad to hear that you left. But I understand how, what do you, what are you up to now? Uh, lots, lots. Um, you know, doing a lot of podcasts, you know, when the air conditioning. Yeah. I mean that's what I'm getting into mostly is HPAC stuff. No, I can fix your air conditioning for you. I've been reading up a lot now. I, uh, I left in a, I started a company called super creative. Super Creative. Dot. TV is our site. Thank you. Thank you. It was originally a, uh, literally was like, what's the least creative name I could come up with?

Speaker 3:          01:45:16       It explains what we do cause I'm like, I'm not spending weeks coming up with a name for double Helix Infusion Studios Llc. Fuck that. We're super creative. That's what we'll do. You know. So, uh, uh, so created it and we uh, we sold a show to Scifi, which we're doing now. I think I, you know what, it's far enough along. We haven't actually put pen to paper, but I'm doing a new mission and my series that will probably announce it. Comicon, we're doing lead up. Um, we're doing a whole bunch of randomness. That's a pretty flashy intro. That's what the winning, the most amazing intro is ever. Oh, thank you. Oh, oh shit. So what we do, what we do really well is hype up websites so we can crash them. Is that server still in his ass? That's where it's being served from right now.

Speaker 3:          01:45:56       That's hilarious. Yeah. Someone I hired Microsoft to do my uh, my demo site. There's a runtime error and tried to do that today. I tried to do what today, tried to do that same stuff today. Probably never be able to put them. It was really, it was kind of, it was, it was censorship wasn't a huge issue with the tag of the show. We were really able to get away with a lot, but they're definitely came to a point where we, there's no way those ideas could even be the thing that you tried to do them, you know, they get shot down, you know, it was weird. There was a lot that I tried to do, which be surprised me that it got shot down. Like chase a greased pig in the studio. It took me like four years to be able to do that. I wanted to, in the middle of an interview, have a guy come out and ringing a cow bell and yell like sweet. And then the graphics role and in a fucking greased pig is released in the studio and we all try to grab it because dumbest fucking thing in the world. And yeah, this, well, I had my moment on our thousandth episode show. I got to catch a grease pig and studio. It was fucking brilliant television. Except the moment when I leap

Speaker 7:          01:46:50       in front of the pig and the pig pork pig looks scared. It was a small little pig. I'm like, oh, now I just feel bad. This pig is in studio lights. There's people cheering. We got hay everywhere. So it was, we made the best of it, but it was, uh, it was doing shit like that was fun. I'm gonna miss that.

Speaker 2:          01:47:04       I stopped eating pigs for awhile. Really? I eat them now, but for a long time I stopped eating them because I watched a documentary called something. My brother's keeper, I think it was, it was about these two guys that were accused of a crime. I forget what the crime is, but they were, they were a bit slow and they were living in a rural area and they ran a farm and they, when they went to a kill a pig, you could tell the pig knew what the fuck was up. You could tell the pig was running away. Pig was terrified and he put that gun up and pig's head and boom, and he did it in front of the other pigs. Pigs remember that shit. They know what the fuck is going on when you come up to him with that gun. And when I saw that and I saw them like, wow, that thinks smart. I think smart. And it knows all, they're incredibly sooner.

Speaker 7:          01:47:48       People know other dirty, filthy, disgusting animals. Actually incredibly intelligent.

Speaker 2:          01:47:52       That's kind of fucked I, that's the only thing that I think of when I think of as us being like related to animals. We love animals. It's only to me it's only intelligent animals. But when I find out in the pig as smart as a dog or smarter, I go, Ooh, that's a smart thing. And that some people kill pigs as pets or keep picks, keeps pigs rather as pets. I'm like, Ooh, they're probably smart. Right. But something stupid like a fish can suck my dick. I don't know. I've never really, you know what I mean?

Speaker 7:          01:48:22       It's like I don't keep around. Actually, I don't feel, I don't feel connected to that fish at all. Right. And I only feel connected to things. I can think if I can win it in a midway game and flush it down three weeks later how and shoot it in the head and the other cows just go, what happened? Well that was loud. Fucking loud as shit. I'm going to walk you over here now. Can you believe that they, that they got flogged raw, like the most insane thing helps me shots some stupid. Meanwhile you can eat goose so dumb. I'm just can't eat delivery. I mean, how about like, look, I understand the argument of there were certainly, there was a percentage of farms that were torturing animals essentially to make it much like the way they torture veal to make it. But yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:49:03       it wasn't even that man. Have you ever seen it? The way they, first of all, the way most of them do it, the the, the fucking ducks actually hover around

Speaker 7:          01:49:11       feeding tube because they want it. Right. And people talk about being shackled in and their heads are thrilled, wouldn't holding, they're using plunger sticks to jam it down their throat. That's the propaganda. And Look, I'm sure that a percentage of farms we're doing that, I'm sure people treat him like shit, you make that illegal. You don't make the fucking biproduct illegal. Why is it not okay to take that one piece, but it's okay to take the whole, well it's

Speaker 2:          01:49:32       no, no, it's not legal to, there's organic Fagua to where they don't force feed them. They just use the liver. Sure. Illegal to now.

Speaker 7:          01:49:40       So let me just, all those stupid fucking duck. It's still, you can still eat duck. He could still lead goose. You can glaze them and them from a window. They

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       essentially made an Oregon the preparation of an Oregon illegal. It's so stupid because first of all, organs are some of the most nutritious things you can eat. You know, liver is really good for you. It's like that's the reason why wolves go for the liver as the reason why cats eat your organs. They were like super healthy for your heart. Hearts are so healthy. It's really like really like maximum proteins just like that guy serving up his dick in Japan. Do you think in the near future, so health, I'm not talking about the nutritional aspects of it, I'm telling you about the concept of eat. Like there being a restaurant near future where human organs are served because they're grown in a fridge somewhere out of petri dishes or whatever. Like we're going to slice into year off the back of this mouse and you're gonna eat it, but a liver or something else.

Speaker 4:          01:50:26       Well, you know, eating parts of human can. Jacob Crutchfield disease. He can cause I'm a mad cow disease. The same essential disease at mad when mad cow is somehow you, when you feed cows, brain matter of other cows and that's what they do. They grind up every fucking part of the cow and then feed it to other cows. It's really insane. Disgusting. It's not just disgusting. It's like psychopathic. It's like they've done something beyond horrendous that not only do they eat these animals and murder these animals on a regular basis, but then they feed them to each other and they feed them protein. Which by the way is not what they eat. Man. That's not their food. Their food is grass. Okay. And they're not even supposed to be eating corn. And the reason why they get so fucking fat is because we feed them corn.

Speaker 4:          01:51:11       Cows eat grass. That's what they eat. That's it, period. So we're feeding him other cows. Well they get this crazy mad cow disease, which is essentially nature's way of keeping you for being a fucking Cannibal, was the same disease that cannibals in New Guinea, get cannibals in New Guinea, get these fucking horrible neurological disorder where they have the shakes and it's full fucking people, man. So I think, I don't think we'll ever see a human organ restaurant because I think if you eat them, you'll probably get sick. I mean it only makes sense. I know the prions are, I believe it's brain matter that that holds them. That's where they get it from initially. This talk is exactly what I needed because I needed somebody to tell me that I couldn't do it. That will be the catalyst. This is my motivator to make, it's a pretty incredible things in petri dishes.

Speaker 4:          01:51:53       Right? I mean, aren't they recreating bladders now? They done that with, I think they've done that with um, they've created a bladder and a and installed it into a person. Yeah. There's no runtime errors. I think a bladder, you know, it's like sort of a bag, so it's probably like a good safe thing to start out with before something that pumps things, you know, before they actually make a heart right now. I'm sure they've done it. I'm sure they've done it and put it in a chimp somewhere and popped. Open the chest and let's see if this powers it. Let's see what happens when we do this. Sure. They have. Yeah, man. Chimps, chimps that gets tested on, I bet they were really angry. Can you imagine what a fucking shit life it is to be as smart as a champ, which is probably like what smarter a chimp or a person with down syndrome. Is it clothes? I would have no idea. I think down syndrome is such a wide spectrum. Right? Like Syndrome Lord knows. Yeah, right.

Speaker 7:          01:52:46       Because corky had a very mild version ever from the facts of life. Remember Axa was it fax facts now that was a wonder years or what was that show? The only corky, no growing pains is the one with Kirk Cameron wasn't it? I'm still upset that I asked that question because I know that's, that's all I'm going to get in all caps in my Twitter feed for the next three weeks. And then was life goes on Bro. You to know Corky,

Speaker 4:          01:53:13       you remember growing pains in my arm before Kirk Cameron became one of the most awesome. He's brilliant.

Speaker 3:          01:53:18       Why is it banana shaped the way it is? I never told you to explain that shit. Joe. I actually was on a plane with Kirk Cameron recently and he was just sitting there looking so sad and depressed and I, cause it was one of those things where uh, I was waiting for somebody else to put like their luggage up so I was just standing right next to him and he's just sitting there like looking at his phone, like looking past this phone, not even looking what's on the screen. And he just sat there and then like some woman came up to him and he just looked up and went like did those are like little smile but it was so weird

Speaker 4:          01:53:49       being too wouldn't you can imagine every day the guy is fighting off the gay with every fiber of his being. He is just clenching his teeth and finding out if you really want to save Kirk Cameron, this is what you do. If you're a big gay guy sitting on his lap and pull your cock out and it'll suck along it like a baby to its mother's breasts, banana peel on it. First security. That's what he's doing. He's just fighting off the gay tooth and nail and claw. And Fang. So funny to me how other people who are most outspoken against homosexuality are just look at him. He's so obviously gang. You can't get any obviously gayer than Kirk Cameron. Not there's anything wrong with being obviously die either. I mean for the guy to be happy, she'd just come out of the closet. All of them just come out.

Speaker 7:          01:54:38       What do you think about the Tom Cruise, Scientology, Surrey or whatever. You know,

Speaker 4:          01:54:43       it's amazing. The Tom Cruise already has a new Ukrainian beauty picture of him and her holding hands are ready in a magazine like a such an obviously stage picture. You're like, Scientology are bad motherfuckers cause they're still rocking it. Old School in 2012 all right. They're putting together storylines. They're creating like narratives. They have like a whole fucking publicity. So like, like whole area, a department that like figures out how to handle that when you Tama girlfriend and we need Tahmo girlfriend. No.

Speaker 7:          01:55:15       Right. It's like a newsroom. Like that's it. They're, they're the the like the News Corp

Speaker 4:          01:55:20       in New York step pitches in New York. Shit. Okay. We need Tom with a hot Russian right now and Tom. Okay, you're going to go on Ellen this time and jump on the couch and you're going to say you're in love and you're, I don't care if you're 50 and you want to fix your career,

Speaker 7:          01:55:36       jump on that woman's couch. All things Seaton the, the videos of them, like people trying to go into their welcome to the

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       public kind of festivals and them coming out and aggressively swarming around people and screaming, what's your issue? What's your problem? What are you hiding? What are you afraid of? It's that's, that's scary shit.

Speaker 4:          01:55:52       They love the cornea bigot too. That's a big one called people bigots. Scientology's fascinating organization to me and just like the cops help people though, man. No doubt about it. I have a neighbor who was a scientologist who's on Nice fucking guy, man. He's a great guy and he had helped him. Man, he tells you all the great things that he did for him and how he helped his business, helped his life and helped us focus and this and that and vogue and believes in it. Who are you to tell them differently? Kevin Pereira. I'm nobody. I'm nobody. Joe Rogan. Do you think, um, how much of a Tom Cruise's life is surrounded by Scientologists cause he just like, you know, Scientology Bible got it.

Speaker 3:          01:56:33       The leaders I think is he the head guy? He wears the pig helmet at the meeting. You know, like he's the one that's like the deepest in and I think, I think there's like a group of like probably like six main players and he's like the one of the head guys, you know, you've just created your own fucking council of it. Right? Seriously. When they meet in their hollowed out volcano, ever seen the video? The staff were full. He's like one of the most powerful guys ever.

Speaker 4:          01:56:58       Can you pull up the video of him in the, do you know the Scientology video where he is a, it's a video that wasn't supposed to,

Speaker 3:          01:57:05       it was like supposed to play it like a conference or something. Right. And he was supposed to be in the, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:57:09       I dunno what you had said. Tom Cruise, creepy speech, Scientology. But whatever it is, they, they had it set up and say, excuse me. They had it set up in this, um, like a hole. It was like a whole auditorium of people that were like watching this tape. Right. Wasn't that like cheering along with it and shed him? Am I remembering that right?

Speaker 3:          01:57:25       No, I think it was. And he was like an annual meeting, like a seminar. Like you sit through that and then they offer you a timeshare and then you get to go skiing.

Speaker 4:          01:57:31       Poor Katie Holmes,

Speaker 3:          01:57:33       poor Jason. But didn't she sign out? Like I've always heard, I've always heard, hey, sign up. They sign up for it. Yeah. And it's like, sure, but, and you get this much money

Speaker 4:          01:57:40       monitor career to come back. I just wanted to be relevant, you know, and guess what man, that's the only way to do it for a lot of these girls, you know, these middling girls, you know, they're doing pretty good there. Okay. And you know, five years goes by and she's 39 ou pass and that's it. It's over. So you've got to make a, you got to bust a move before your fucking rice runs out of the fuck it sand out of the thing. What it was

Speaker 3:          01:58:08       sand out of the hourglass or the that thing. The old rice rice do that. Why

Speaker 4:          01:58:12       did I feel like there's a similar measuring devices, rice and some cultures. I'm sure there are. Yeah. Maybe it was gotta be someone figured that out. I spend way too much time thinking about ancient civilizations of ancient cultures. Got gotta be honest with you. Yeah, it's a real problem. It's a distraction. From thinking about current events, when do you think we're going to wipe ourselves out or upload ourselves into the machines so it doesn't matter. Like how soon it seems again like it's going to happen in our lifetime. It seems like the leaps are coming so fast. Did you see the new TSA screening devices? Whitten for which?

Speaker 1:          01:58:44       Look at them all. Slapping. He's got a metal. He did it. It's got a metal to metal.

Speaker 3:          01:58:49       The religion, I have never met

Speaker 10:         01:58:52       a more competent the world or background agent Cody. I'm hollering and more compassionate being outside of what I've experienced from LRH and I've met the leaders of leaders. Okay. I've met them all. So I say to you, sir, cob, we are lucky to have you and thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:59:17       Beautiful. We will have, it wasn't, he's beautiful.

Speaker 3:          01:59:20       What's an l Ron busted on like a boat in international waters having sex with underage people. Yup. Okay. Something, well maybe not, but I said Yup. What made it so there we go. Update the Wiki. Can we just get that? And that's not even the one man. There's one where he was appearing by tape, right? Yeah. Yeah. That's the one I originally found. But I thought you were talking about that one. That was beautiful too though. He's beautiful. He's just so charismatic. Would sign up for five years with that. So that should, that helped my career. If I just had an inkling of, of the possibility that maybe he would hang out with me, I could just write cultures. That's it. I think at the music, like

Speaker 6:          01:59:59       once you know these tools and you know that they work, it's just not good enough. And I'm just doing okay. Traveling the world and meeting the people that I've met, you know, talking with these leaders, get various fields they want help and they're depending on people who know and who can be effective in doing that is our responsibility to do that. It is the time. Now is the time. Stop it. Stop. This is beautiful. How he shot me. Fucking beautiful. You better. You better know it. And if you don't, you know, go and learn it. What?

Speaker 3:          02:00:49       Oh, that's the option. If I don't know what I need to learn it, she's, it's not

Speaker 4:          02:00:54       the end of it. The end of it is what I wanted to hear. What he says that if you stop by an accident, you know you have to do something cause you're a scientist. It's an eight minute video of Sec. Oh here I'll try to skip. Don't, don't make me get my dick hard. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:01:07       yeah, yeah. That's too intense for me. I just loved the music and possible music. I love the, you know, I love all of them are religious mission. Should you choose to accept it and an Iq distresses. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:01:18       The conviction. I love the, the fake act or intensity involved in it and I know that he's just thinking of, I have one more hour this and I'm going to fuck everyone who's got this. Like 10 dudes just waiting for him,

Speaker 3:          02:01:32       prepping them right now. Like a horse that knows he's on the end of the trail and he's getting back to the feedback there. She knows there's 12 dudes in the back of warming up. It might be ready

Speaker 6:          02:01:41       that I've done everything I could every day. Think about those people out there who are depending on us. I think it does make me, she'll have more work. I need more help and I'll get those spectators. You're into playing field or out of the arena,

Speaker 5:          02:02:10       the playing field or out of the arena. That has great, yeah. You're there with us who have the answers and we have, we can provide all the help or ladies and gentlemen, please watch the whole thing because there's so much glory in it. There's so much awesome that's in it. It's so ridiculous, but you know what man? It's like we, we value charisma like that so much that a guy like that who can step up and tell you what Scientology can do to maximize you and that you will be a better person. It's not. If you don't become a but you will be a better person. Thank you very much. The reason you're not right now is because you haven't joined. Come on dude. How crazy do you have to be to be wearing a metal to wear a fucking Olympic gold medal bigger than the Olympic medal?

Speaker 5:          02:03:00       The date they said, what's the Olympic medal? Mega 10% bigger because this is important. Melt those Olympic rings into one giant metal and make it match his eyes. We make it out of the gold we took from the fillings at Auschwitz and yeah, that's special evil goal that we have saved up that we'd been a radiating and saying mean things to her years. One fucking pile of all the gold that they know was made in and gotten through the worst circumstances like black beards, fucking pirate treasure. I mean, we know he murdered babies for this goal or this is the goal. I want mold into that. What do you think? What do you, what are you watching? The flights. You're Tom Cruise screensaver cut. Then all your photos of that half naked. Okay, stop right there. Back up a second. Think about this real quick. Look at him with Val Kilmer.

Speaker 5:          02:03:48       Now think about what he looks like, which is the fucking same. He's showing him the house, but inside I'm in this photo. What Val Kilmer? Look it. He's saying, I'm getting you to the elbow. I snack Kilmer Val Kilmer has continued to age whereas Tom Cruise had, he got to a certain point and then just stopped dying because he's been eating from a human liver restaurant and you don't know about it yet. The Petri dish, human liver restaurant, he goes into the cryo freezer, especially pigs is Oregon's as in love with Katie's back in the day. Meanwhile, what is he thinking about their cock? That's what he's thinking about cock. He's thinking about cost there. He's thinking of a cocky. He's, he's, he's ready for an actual yelling for cock. I actually want to say on the record that I don't think he's gay and he doesn't want like that because at my name is Brian Ryko in my, usually my stage name is Red Van and I disagree with everyone

Speaker 7:          02:04:38       here. Mr. Cruz and I'm sorry. Oh, what'd you do it if he doesn't, even if he doesn't want cock, I think you should try it. Yeah, because it might be his thing. Brian, would you do a five year stint with Tom Cruise? If it meant unlimited wealth and career success? Five months. Let's just say five months in my compound I have to have sex or just hang out with him for Frankie have to, you have to either fuck or be fucked by Tom Cruise. One of the two has to happen for sure. Unlimited wealth. Unlimited wealth. Sure. And success. Would you do now career success five months at Tom Cruise sex slave? Absolutely not. You wouldn't for unlimited? Well No. What does unlimited wealth? I don't know. It just never having to worry about it. Yeah, but could you buy like jets and shit? Certainly. You can imagine if your butthole, you're letting the guy fuck your butthole was worth that much.

Speaker 7:          02:05:22       It was like there was a way you can negotiate it. I'm sure it is. This subtle salt out there somewhere now. People think of it that they're like sucked your Dick just for dinner and like, really? I could've gotten unlimited wealth if I just got a better agent. If we were talking about Zac Efron, they maybe a man. Don't let me get lunch with those eyes. Don't look at those. Don't, don't. Um, how many guys do you think are in Hollywood that are in the closet that are forced to be in the closet because they play action star, I think. I think there's a, I think there's a shit ton of m and I also think there's a lot of guys who who, well, I mean it's like the guys who go gay for pay, like who aren't gay guys, but they're like, fuck, if I got to take a dick to make fucking ends meet, let's go crazy.

Speaker 7:          02:05:57       Some dude's just have lower standards. They'll, they'll let things happen. Looks maybe, maybe I call it adventurous Joe. Fuck you for putting a label on anybody who might do that out there. Anybody at all. If you want to do it though. It seems like a company like Scientology is fucking awesome to have in your corner. It seems like they, I mean, I don't know. We're just totally speculating. You sure. What role, if any of that and speculating by the way, whether or not he's actually get much surgery. Certainly. No, no. It starts to be crazy. I just, the notion of a Scientology to like if I were to join it as a, as a d list, struggling actors, web celebrity type, if I would have joined Scientology and kick in a hundred grand the first year, maybe 200 grand, that's going to buy me to a certain level where I'm in meetings with people who are heads of movie studios and making decisions and they go, look at this young gentleman here who's paying in and he's, he's playing the game.

Speaker 7:          02:06:45       Let's put him in that movie, getting a little bit more because we know he's going to contribute to the church. You know what, he's going to be an ambassador. But how much that, how much did they actually control? That's the big question is like they obviously control Tom Cruise because he's really successful. I mean, you look at Tom Cruise, Tom Cruise has been in a bunch of really big hit movie. So that's why they control him. That's why they handle his business because he's a massive investment. Sure he's worth a ton of money. But how, you know he's that guy, but for they're already there. You know what I'm saying? Well, how much can they do for you? How much can they get? How much could they get Kevin Pereira help? How much could they weasel you in? How much should it have a good pitch? Which is, you know, maybe they'd get me a Hulu web series. I know in mission impossible five just so you know, I'll take, you know, that's what I mean. Like they could help me out on a certain level. And then as, as you grow with them and they help you, then you contribute more and they help groom you for that. They are essentially

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       like a form of a talent agency for some, I'm sure for some they're probably a beard agency for others. There are talent agency. Do you know what I mean? Like they just offer all different servers. What do you need? You're in the church now and they have your secrets. They audit you, they know all about your past and your history and that's part of the initiation process is that you divulge everything to them. So then you hear the whole wheat

Speaker 4:          02:07:54       good. They are Cuban secrets. Amazing. It's pretty fucking sweet. Yeah. I mean, think about how many dudes that must have the fucking inside scoop on John Travolta and the like, we ain't hear it. Scientology or coming to do a mission.

Speaker 3:          02:08:09       Wow. That was amazing. Like was there a group on, on just gay Mizuho's disorders like, and it just came out of the woodwork.

Speaker 4:          02:08:15       Yeah. Once one guy came out it, the guys were like, oh no, he did and I'm going to get mine too.

Speaker 3:          02:08:20       Yeah, absolutely. If you're stepping forward, I am. I wonder if they got paid. They got paid. My money must have been exchanged. Well, they suddenly started withdrawing all their lawsuits and you know that, I don't know if that's, maybe they were frivolous. I don't know. But uh, he's just come out. Just come on now, dude. No one cares. Yeah. Well look it, I mean, I'm sure like Anderson Cooper recently came out and I did that matter. I mean, did that, no,

Speaker 4:          02:08:42       the people that care suck, you know, it's not funny that people are gay. What's funny is that people are straight pretending they're gay. Right? Or rather gay bars. Pretentious. Straight. That's what's funny. Right? It's not the actual being gay. I know a lot of gay people, but it's hilarious when there's fucking obviously gay people like the Kirk Cameron.

Speaker 3:          02:09:01       I'm just shocked whenever there's a legislative setback and like, you know, being gay in the gay rights movement, like you can still easily draw a line that's parallel to any other time there's been a debate involving marriage or any other discrimination suit and you go, Yo, that was wrong. We were wrong about discriminating. That's right. We were wrong. We figured that out and yet here we are discriminating and mass and volume loudly and openly and it's, you know, it's a platform for some people politically and that's, that's okay. Right now we're okay with that. Even with all the knowledge and access to history that we have, we're okay with that.

Speaker 4:          02:09:33       Well, religion is always been the big, I mean, if you want to look at one thing that's oppresses gay people, nothing has suppressed, gave you more than religion and almost every person who is against people who are gay being married is religious. I mean, that is just a, it's not an ideological viewpoint. It's, it's, it's a religious viewpoint. Sure. It's where it comes from there. The ideology that, that really, that, that action is, is negative in any way is connected direct directly to religion and for no one, I know that's an eighth

Speaker 3:          02:10:01       for a myriad of societal issues though, from religion to abortion to whatever. I mean, the main thing people say, well, it's a political issue now. It's actually a religious issue and one political side. At times. It ebbs and flows. We'll side more with religions. Well, it's traditionally Republican, but

Speaker 4:          02:10:16       Ronald Reagan, Ronald Reagan started all that shit off. That's where the big slide in this country came before then, religion really was separated from politics. It wasn't a big thing, but the Ronald Reagan, they went after the fucking religious right. They knew they were a powerful force. They knew they could rally up and they could protest and they could, you know, they could, they could do

Speaker 3:          02:10:37       payment, hand out the pamphlets, tell every Sunday beam the message into people's heads if that's the whales,

Speaker 4:          02:10:42       fucking mindless drones that need a, a purpose to live, are happy to be a part of that organization and they were in locked in those sons of bitches.

Speaker 3:          02:10:51       I always think though, I got to figure out, for me what my spiritual parallel is, because every story that I read about, you know, everything from placebo effect to spiritual people heal quicker because they believe that they will heal quicker. I've got to figure out the proper way and the healthy way to unlock that with me because I'm such a skeptic about everything and that help you that with any pill, with any drug, with any, anything, even just positive thought, I'll eventually convinced myself that it will not work. I can help you. Oh please, sure

Speaker 4:          02:11:17       I've already conquered this. Didn't help you tremendously. He life is a simulation and it's a simulation for your own benefit. You live in a future, a sexless future where people take orgasm pills and most breeding is done through some sort of a genetic manipulation where he just fucking recreate people in laboratories and there's no sex, there's no meat. You don't eat steak, you don't talk, you use your brain and it's beautiful. And we've organized and you know, basically evolved past the point of physical violence and pleasure and all sorts of different things that are essentially just tricks of genetics. But it's boring. No one's getting their dick sucked the music fucking terrible. You can't go out and get a good steak. So we have decided to, in case our consciousness in a simulation and the simulation is we are in the roaring twenties of the technology age. We live back in a time where things were crazy. We could go to a store and buy a fucking 600 horsepower car and just drive. The speed limit is 55 miles an hour rank rank. Meanwhile, you can go buy a Shelby Mustang, 600 fucking horse.

Speaker 3:          02:12:22       So were the matrix, but we got to pay for patches,

Speaker 4:          02:12:25       Peng, and it's, that's part of the fun of it all is that everything is corrupt and ridiculous. Part of the fun of a Batman movies effect. There's bad guys. Okay. Part of the fun of a of our life is the fact that yeah, we do live in this ridiculously corrupt society. Yeah. When you, when you raise your voice and you, you stand up and you tell people, this is fucking bullshit. That does feel good. It's part of the game. It's all part of the fun and reality. It doesn't, it doesn't matter at all. You're, you're a simulation and you probably will never die. You will, you will live in this simulation and it will fucking blackout one day and you'll wake up in the middle of a fucking, uh, uh, some sort of a forest fire with your friends and your, you're working in the, in the, in the blazing heat trying to put out this fire and that's your real life because you, you know, you woke up in some new reality and then it's going to keep going on, on a table, licking salt.

Speaker 4:          02:13:17       It'll go on forever. There's no ending. You don't get a break. You know, you don't get to sit behind the pearly gates someday and reminisce and try to figure out if it all went the way you wanted it to. And well next time I'm going to come back as a baby. No, it's just one thing that never ends. The leaving. That doesn't make me feel like my plantar fasciitis is going to heal quicker. Well you got to put yourself in a different state of mind. You got to decide with your mind cause that's how you control this video game. You got to decide with your mind to be the hero in your own story and that if you were going to be the hero in your own story and the story was going to be fucking bad ass, what were the hero do right now? How would the hero get his shit together? It's a long, I need to do it. I need to invent dragons and dragons and hover boards set. Maybe you could do it. That's the calling. If that's your calling, that's everybody has one, but whatever your calling is, you just got to decide you're the hero in the story. What would the hero do? It's really not that hard. This fucking air conditioning sucks.

Speaker 3:          02:14:10       Yeah, it's pretty broad. You don't mind if I could let him in here just so he can look at it and check things. Oh, we're doing podcasts. Jesus Christ right now. No, I mean like if you can just walk in the background, you know this is, we want to come back right now. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:14:24       yeah, sure. Okay, cool. Got It. I think we're going to just wrap this up anyway. Right? Are we done? What time is it? Two hours. 15 do you wanna keep talking? Happy to if you'd like. Let's let that dude come in here and

Speaker 3:          02:14:36       all right. It's pretty, it's really hot. It's swampy. I hear tropical birds crying and my taint right now, it is rough. You could rent a boat through it.

Speaker 4:          02:14:44       The poor air conditioning is trying to do something ridiculous. This place is filled with holes. If you look at all these doors right here, you could see straight through. There's no insulation in this place. Sure. There's a fucking windows right there. The Sun comes blazing down those windows and it's 106 degrees outside and there's rabid bats in Pasadena. Have you heard about that shit, dude? They found a rabid bat in Pasadena. Now they're warning the residents in this particular area where we're at,

Speaker 3:          02:15:10       they says viral marketing, Vat about marketing for a new Batman movie. It's all it is. This is leading up to comicon.

Speaker 4:          02:15:16       Could you imagine those sons of bitches? Can you imagine if they started manipulating the news?

Speaker 3:          02:15:19       They said, I mean, look, shitty movies. Certainly. If you think so. Yeah. Well, I mean maybe not releasing a rabid bat, but I mean releasing the news report about it. It would certainly do that.

Speaker 4:          02:15:28       We're going to bioengineer some, some rats and give them a a poison and then send them out for the new movie. Willard, we're pretty sure we know how to stop him. We're going to just, they did that. They would really attracted to blood with the blood in the streets all come out. We'll kill them all. Don't worry.

Speaker 3:          02:15:44       That would do that at comicon. They need to just release a patient zero at comicon to promote the new resident evil and just let them walk around and know that one guy at comicon, if you meet them, you get a free tee shirt, but I'll also give you a Zombie aids.

Speaker 4:          02:15:55       Have you seen the giant rats they found in New York City? Some of them they found in the Bronx. Well, apparently it's a type of rat that's like, uh, let me, let me Google this. It's, Brian isn't here, but it's a, it's a huge fucking rat. Like so big. Like you, you look at it and you'll wait Iranian size or like clydesdale size. I'm talking like, like, like a Johnson. Really? Yeah. Like one of those dots in New York. Yeah. There it is. It's on a fucking, it's crazy, man. It's on a spear and there, there's more than one of them. One of them they killed. They're sending exterminators into the sewers with spheres to kill these rats. The size of that got killed it with a pitchfork. Oh Shit. Yeah. Yeah. They're, they're, they're not a rabbit or ferret or songs. It's apparently a type of rat.

Speaker 4:          02:16:51       It's not like a regular street rat that people have had as pets and released and apparently they get fucking big man. And that's right to see where people have always, you know, heard about rats in New York City. Like, yeah. It's rats. The size of catch in New York City. Well, there really are. Yeah. Those are cruising around surface streets. That's not like miles under the ground and a sewage tunnel or something. Those guys are running around. Oh yeah, they were there in houses and Shit. You know, they're digging their way into people's houses. Jesus. Yeah. There's other, there's another rat that they've found a in a shoe shop and it was insanely big here. It's going to get to the point where cockroaches are this one right here, the size, like the size of this rap, they found this rat in a, um, in a shoe shop in New York City.

Speaker 4:          02:17:40       Uh, it looks like a shovel. The size of that fucking thing. Yeah, it's a cat. Insane. And meanwhile there's this many of them as there are people in New York City's as many, I hope they don't ever figure out how to organize God. Why if one rat was coming out, you'd shit your pants. You know, I just freak out when I see a spider the size of a dime. But the coming down from the reality is they're eating something, right? So there's gotta be, it's like set up, it's set up. This is their part of the ecosystem. It's just a part that nobody in those fancy towers once ever think about who, what, what is, what is pray for that route? Are they eating other giant rats that side's dumpster diving, like certainly eat each other. I've, I've had rats in my garage, in each other.

Speaker 4:          02:18:26       I killed a big rat, wants left the body out in the garage that got killed in a trap. It was like midnight. I didn't feel like I was lazy. I didn't feel like cleaning the travel. So I'll fucking clean it tomorrow. I went out there tomorrow and the rat was gone. Everything but the tail, they had eaten them. Jesus had his bones, dude, they had everything. I mean, it was crazy. There's, it just left a little bit of skin and some like, you know, parts of their feet. I mean, it was insane. Just enough to identify the body. And these were big fucking rats to the rats in the, I was in Encino and the time and the hills, you know, above, um, above the valley who's a lot of rats up there. God damn was a lot of rats and coyotes everywhere. I mean you want to, they're just those ones, the fuckers, they just keep checking in with mother nature to see if we wiped ourselves out yet. They're like looking around. Nope. Nope. Lights are still on. Yeah, there's still people here. Yeah, we're waiting. We're waiting. We're waiting till we take it over again. And it's not daisy yet. You guys have a nuke each other. Okay. All right. Well we'll cruise back and then come back out. We'll run towards the blast. When there's a nuclear blast, they're going to run towards it. Just start fucking just eating

Speaker 7:          02:19:28       the first thing they find first, the first dead person they find. Have you, uh, have you heard about this? Uh, it's the, the game called daisy. It's an add on to this. This is very realistic. Military Simulator Arma two. But they, they, this guy made like one guy is making a little indie game called daisy and you start off on it. It's online and you're completely defenseless and helpless and on your own. And there's a small Zombie outbreak and there's a lot of human beings running around and you very quickly have to figure out what is more threatening to you. You have to get your gun, get your food, get your ammo, like try to meet up. You can meet up with random people and talk to them, but nine times out of 10 that random person's going to shoot you in the face. And that's what's so insane is that like they built the simulator where it's a Zombie outbreak, but just like the real Zombie outbreak would be, the real threat are your fellow human beings.

Speaker 7:          02:20:10       It has nothing to do with the zombies, you know? Yeah. In fact, one guy a blogged, he was in a town like clearing it and these dudes came out of the bush with automatic rifles and like camouflage in the average lifespan for this game is only like a handful of hours. Most people get in, they scrounge around people kill people kill you. Cause they can. Yeah, exactly. They'll take your supplies. Once you see that you're good enough. So you have to really take care of your character and be stealthy and then try to build it up. So this guy is in the middle of the city and like six dudes pop out, put them at gunpoint and they said, we're going to kill you unless you become our slave. And the guy was like, fuck, I don't want to lose my character. And they said, listen, you just follow us around for a few hours to send you into cities to scout for us.

Speaker 7:          02:20:45       We'll defend you if you get attacked, but you have to be our slave and do what we say or else we're going to kill you right now. And the guy was like, all right, let's do this. They made them kneel and pose for photos. He was like a catch like people do this. And he said that at the end of it like that he went into cities and scouted for him and he really felt like he was one with the group after a few hours and then like he went and they went to like clear a bus and they got ambushed and slowly one by one they were all getting killed and he felt so bad. He was like, Oh man, my group got killed and he quickly identified with a group of online captors were Stockholm Syndrome. Yeah. But in the matter of minutes in the virtual world of like, well uh, all right I guess I'll go along with you.

Speaker 7:          02:21:20       Here we go. Well you could say that that guy's an idiot. Well I mean what else, what were his choices? Play another game sucks so much Twitter form just allowed someone to be a cunt anonymously. You can't have that, you know that's that's that's those are work. Does it work? Can you came? That's how all online games are. That's why 12 year olds call you with current and you know tea bag you every five seconds every on ongoing that just veneer of anonymity. Lets people eviscerate each other. It brings out the worst Torsten human beings. Well, when ever you have no consequences for your actions. It's a weird thing that we figured out how to do is that everyone's getting connected. But in doing so, there's going to be some sort of a weird period where it's still sort of working itself out where there's anonymity and interaction at the same time. And that's sort of where we're at right now. Yeah. We have both anonymity and interact. Hyper interaction. Hyperconnectivity really can't even take place anywhere else. I mean, how else could that even take place except the Internet in the nature and the natural world that devry no fail safes. Well, I got a hole in an adult

Speaker 3:          02:22:25       theater. Even then you can fuck somebody else and not know who was on the other side of the divide. You could

Speaker 4:          02:22:30       good. Then I feel your teeth stop, stop, stop. And even then there's consequences. Sure. How you feel bad about your Dick Sucking job?

Speaker 3:          02:22:36       Well, you know what's funny is I fork a Dick and a glory. What's this world coming to? Fucking Twitter. You are useless. Your Dad was right, but I have found that like when, uh, when people will tweet something negative to me, which is constantly, if I reply, if I spent half a second to reply and let them know that I actually listened to their criticism or, you know, I'm sorry you thought that what I said was terrible, but here's why I believe it was just that ounce of attention actually makes people Apollo. I mean certainly there are trolls. Certainly there are trolls, but I've been, I've been pleasantly surprised at how open people are once you kind of call them out on, you're kinda being a Dick Right now, but I do respect your opinion. It's really funny. Yes. I'm that equalizer

Speaker 4:          02:23:13       possible. Yeah. A lot of times we're just trying to get a reaction and certainly there is just, there's a lot of cons out there that are just jealous to the jealous of the fact that they know who you are and you don't know who they are, so they lash out at you just because of that. They see you on the show is like, he's not even really a geek. I'm a real deep,

Speaker 3:          02:23:31       I love the Geek test. I love that. They're so silly. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:23:35       People love just like things going in. Like if you ever gone on a fucking website that reviews cars and dudes will go on about how automatic transmissions are for fags. Dude's we'll have like like, oh wow, automatics are gay. They'll like get angry.

Speaker 3:          02:23:52       You don't shift. You don't even get to put your hand on a knob. How gay is that? Think really. You get so connected to the road. It's like almost the vibration.

Speaker 4:          02:24:00       Anything to be angry about it, they'll find anything to relate to anything. You know what I mean? Many people are mad at us for shitting on windows today. I bet a hundred tweets. Oh you mad facts. Just don't understand what a run time error.

Speaker 3:          02:24:14       I love it. I recently bought a gaming laptop and was like tweeting out about it and I'm like, this is great. And you know, not only did I get from the Mac fans, I got, oh you went back to windows, you're running a windows machine. That's a mistake. Then from gamers who should be, who should be supporting anybody who's playing PC games or laptop. Oh that must be cause you love Dick in your eye. Right. That's why you went for a laptop because you didn't get a tower and you didn't, oh you didn't water cooler, whatever. Yeah, you don't even overclock and at some guy got, I yelled at the Nvidia Graphics Card Company. I was having a problem. They weren't supporting the hardware that I bought. He spent thousands of dollars on a machine and they don't officially support the hardware that's in it yet. Like you couldn't download a driver for it.

Speaker 3:          02:24:52       First World fucking problem. I'm well aware of that, but I was against it and I tweeted it out and I got so many people that were like, dude, download the Linux distro driver. Happy the inf file. Fucking right. Here's a five page tutorial and how to do it. Fucking get it going. And I'm like, really? That's not, that's not worth my time or money. And that's how you're choosing to chastise me. I appreciate that people are into that. I appreciate it. Totally. I used to be one of those guys, but Linux computer and I used to, I was a Unix guy. I was a coder like for sure. But did you do like what is the most impressive piece of code? You have a road? Um,

Speaker 7:          02:25:24       well I shouldn't say that. I, I guess that was more load balancer and stuff for like, uh, for, for routers and stuff. So I would balance the way packets were distributed and the uh, the boxes at an ISP. Oh really? So you worked at an ISP balancing pack and that was one of many yeah, jobs ever. You do that, what do you do? I was at work go into, go into inf, well not nine to five, but you go into files and basically look at the way packets are routed by IP address and packet type and you assign priorities to them and you make sure that the servers can talk to each other. So one servers and taking on everything. It's distributing this sort of network load against everything else. But I mean that was, there was that there'd be phone tech support. They would be writing visual basic installers for windows three one and dealing with wind sock errors and all sorts of crazy shit when the barrier to entry to get online was actually pretty fun.

Speaker 3:          02:26:09       Difficult. What year were you online? Was the first year what? AOL Was it? No, it wasn't an [inaudible]. That's, I'm so beautiful. Have male. I feel so privileged to have not experienced the internet through prodigy or AOL. At first I used something called the knowledge network routers you is for serious people. Prodigy was for low. Remember project did you really? Customer service. Okay. We're going to pretend that we're calling you and Kevin, you're the color and you've got an issue and you call him Brian. You're the customer service guy is actually called tech, which was a company that routed prodigy because through them and they I did prodigy and like this is back when call centers were handled in the u s still, right? Yeah, so you call ready go Brian. I want to know how you're going to fucking greet me. I'm not going to be greeted on the customer needs to be a spiel. Hello, my name is Brian and my ticket master one thing's gone. Ticketmaster, where American Express is the preferred method of payment. This call may be monitored for quality assurance purposes by a supervisor. This is Brian speaking. How can I help you? You can American Express right off the bat, the preferred preferred sponsor, what's that all about? And they would probably paid for that little shit. There's a kickback, well amax does

Speaker 7:          02:27:16       early like if, if you'd let you, I'm certain Amex cards get you early access to certain ticket master events. It's all one big promotional kickback madness sons. It was crazy throwing a live event and seeing just how that, that industry needs to be disrupted. So bad for live events like ticket sales, like we want it. We, we were, we were charged charging essentially a $7 ticket for lead up. That's what we were asking, which turned into a $25 ticket after convenience fees, processing charges, the house gets their cut like everything on our ticket, $7 and it ended up costing 25. And that's what it has to do that when I do concerts and, uh, in, in certain venues, but after to feel like they have to get paid to, why else would they have a theater if they're not getting money? Well, the, the, the theater, the theater is getting a very small fee on that, on that ticket fee.

Speaker 7:          02:28:03       Right? They're getting a very small amount that he was gonna make their money off of the door and are off of, off of parking and off of food and beverage. Mosley who's fucking you then? Um, you know, I think they're still partners on some of our leadup tours that we haven't completely divorced ourselves. But I love what Louis C K is doing, going completely independent and saying there's certain companies that venues, and in some areas they own every fucking venue that's worth a damn. And there's some bands that have exclusivity with those venues. So if they tour, they have to play in one of those venues and use their ticketing systems. It's all designed to maximize their profit and make it fucking impossible for you to make one as a small event in a big venue. Um, and it needs to be disrupted. And the notion of, I guess you could kind of kickstart or something, but there should be a site or service where people can demand an event in their area. And if enough people demand that, then you can, you can take bids from local venues, you know what I mean? To disrupt that model. So you're not picking a venue first, trying to guarantee a certain number of ticket sales and then going on sale and trying to drum up publicity.

Speaker 2:          02:29:01       Hmm. Um, I, I could see your point in that if you are doing this, you can force bands to pay to charge much more. But is it because the people, they have contracts to keep steady work coming in because otherwise, I mean, how much steady work is going to come into these theaters? I don't know how that business really works.

Speaker 7:          02:29:22       I think it's, I think it's, I think they have, I shouldn't say half the time. I really don't know that the numbers there, but how those metrics shake out. But I believe they are purchasing venues, ticket agents, they own the venue. It's there.

Speaker 2:          02:29:33       Don't they have agreements with like, like talent agencies and how do they work all that

Speaker 7:          02:29:38       sometimes. Um, yeah. I don't know what specifics I could get into like, yeah, yeah. It's,

Speaker 2:          02:29:43       what do you think specifically should be disrupted? You think that it's too difficult? It's too easy to control the market. Is that what it is?

Speaker 7:          02:29:50       Yeah. Well, I mean it's, you're, you're locked out. If you want to play a, if you want to play a certain type of venue in certain cities, you have no choice but to go with a certain ticketing agency that has their own built in fees and system. And at one ticket age he has a deal with the vent. They have an agreement with the venues or sometimes they own the venue. But don't you think

Speaker 2:          02:30:05       because they can provide the ax to the venue, isn't it the idea behind it? Um,

Speaker 7:          02:30:10       sometimes, but you know, as an independent who isn't signed on with that, you still have to play that game. You know what I mean? You don't have a choice. You literally don't have a choice in certain areas with certain venues. But what I think needs to be disrupted is the notion of we're going, like if you're going to go tour, you pick your dates and your clubs probably based off of metric, ton of data or off of Twitter. And then you say, we're going to go to these things and you go on sale and you have to promote and hope you sell those tickets and hope that goes through. I think there needs to be a Kickstarter style model where people can, within like you can pick an area and so within, you set a radius a hundred miles, 200 miles. I want to throw an event here, describe your event.

Speaker 7:          02:30:43       And then as people like on Facebook or whatever, or they donate, I'm going to spend $20 on that event for a little extra bonus and become an, uh, an evangelist of your brand or of your tour. So I'm going to sign up more people and I, I'm incentivized to sign up people. I think you can, you can see what the demand is in an area first and incentivize early adopters to raise publicity about your event by giving them kickbacks or stickers or extra merged or whatever for being an evangelist. And that way when you launched the tour, you already know you've presold x amount in those areas because people have committed. So it's not like Kickstarter for touring. That's an interesting idea. Yeah, that's a great idea. I'm just what I want to do. That's what you want. Do sure. I want to do again and again and again and again.

Speaker 7:          02:31:22       You said it live, that's doing it. I started to do it actually like, uh, I started to do it and, and just realized I have too many plates spinning right now, so someone wants to do that. Awesome. I hope you do. I'd love to use that service. And if you want me on the advisory board, fuck yeah. But I just don't have the, you know, I'm, I've got a lot of plates spinning. So the way it is is the big venues and nice places are all locked up. Pretty much. Yeah. Pretty much. Hmm. And uh, yeah, I mean, you have to go with the, there's, there's Ticketmaster venues, so if you want to play a certain venue, you're paying ticket master that's happening. Didn't, oh, who's the band that tried to Seattle? What? The Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam. And they, I mean, they did for their fans, but you know, that's like Radiohead saying anybody can release an album for free online.

Speaker 7:          02:32:08       It's like, well, you can, if you've reached a certain size right. You know, if your, if your Pearl Jam, you can fight back against Ticketmaster. If you're trying to throw a night of comedy together or throw together a nerd carnival and you, you know, you, you have to play by their rules. Right, right, right. Yeah, it's wild. That's interesting. And it's, well, it's hard to run a fucking venue out. Imagine man, let a thankless Gig. I have a bunch of assholes come and put on fucking shows at your place. Really? Cops behind. Well, I mean, that's part of you. I mean that's, you're, you're paying for someone to clean up their venue. You're always paying for that. It's not like, you know, that's, that's built in and that's why the venue should get their charge. If they're throwing the event there, then sure you're paying for them to staff people to clean it up and make sure microphones work and lights work.

Speaker 7:          02:32:48       I mean, that's what you're paying for, but, but $17 for a convenience fee. What? There's nothing convenience convenient about that. What is the convenience for, you know, it all depends. It's a sliding scale on a certain price ticket. It's a, there's a builtin fee plus a percentage. So you have to price your tickets at a certain way so that you don't end up fucking everybody else over and you end up losing money on that front. That sounds like a viewer more successful though. And you sold more tickets, you wouldn't have that problem. Yeah. Make money. Yeah. You, you can't, you look, you can certainly make money off ticket sales. That's absolutely sure. Even how to even handle our ambassador and how all these companies like lock everything down like this. Uh, well at one point in time, I think they were a very convenient and they were sort of the only game and then they, then they started going to events and doing, you know, deals with them.

Speaker 7:          02:33:28       You're going to sell your tickets through ticket master and nobody else. And look, we're online and breezy and we're great and customers love it. And then once that wasn't trenched and they bought their deals and do deals with people who own the venues, then they lock you out and keep power. I mean it's, I think it's a snobby, there's certainly companies that are trying to disrupt it, like Brown paper tickets. They're trying to do independent ticketing for events I used for the last one. Yeah, there's, there's, there's a lot of companies that are trying to disrupt that space but to throw events at certain venues, the granted they're nice venues, the great venues. That's why we chose club Nokia. I mean it was phenomenal. Great venue and I loved everybody that worked there. It was a great experience, but it's just unfortunate that you'd want to charge $7 for something and because of the system that's entrenched around it, you end up charging 25 that's sad. That hurts, you know? That's, that's triple what we want to charge, you know? Right. It's still only 25 bucks. You stop complaining, so lead up is going to be like people are going to perform. You're going to have, I want it to be, I want it to be in a carnival, a true carnival atmosphere. I want you to be able to play skeeball wear of bow tie. When weird. Are you going to let be a weird host?

Speaker 3:          02:34:33       I'm going to put on that thing, that green suit with the question marks on it like either like the government or the guy that's selling your things on this. That's the question mark to face guy. Well, hello nerds. Let me pander to you

Speaker 7:          02:34:45       for an hour. Yeah, you're going to have to do something to stand out as the promoter, perhaps something with feathers. Would you be willing or interested in wearing a boa? Absolutely. I would. I would rock a, I would rock a bow on stage. Like how many guys who are the host have to like where do something flamboyant, like have a cigarette in a cigarette holder or that Sam, he's the host, see him with a cigarette and the cigarette holder, he's our host. I love how we're opening this year's tour. I'm Mike rounds coming along, so I'm gonna play drums with them for a little bit of it's set in. Oh, he's an Mac. Mike Brown is a phenomenal VJ. He's one of the guys that spend those visuals. He's close to the Olympics. He's toured it, the blue man group. Like, oh, he's pro VJ. Like he's the Tso objs. Is that what I think? So I put them on that on that part. Yeah, absolutely. He does remixes for, Oh, you're getting hypnotized by our first lead up promo. Um, he, uh, he's one of those guys that will cut all the trailers for official movies and films and stuff like that. All the remix trailers. But we're opening it up at that old, uh, Hbo, eighties thing. You know, like Hbo would play before every movie where you fly over the city

Speaker 3:          02:35:45       flying to the letters.

Speaker 11:         02:35:47       Diana,

Speaker 3:          02:35:50       we're doing that and remember that. It's one of my favorite. Oh good. And, and the documentary on them making that is brilliant. They were like, they invested so much money and building a little stop motion animated town that the camera could fly over and they comped in the average family watching TV. Like what? Gathering around, watch HBO and the camera flies over the city and goes into the stars. It was a beautiful piece of advertising. You need to explain to me how you don't like game of Thrones because I just don't understand you. Well that's, I got to give it three episodes because I've watched the first one. It was a lot of talking and you know, a lot of people said the same thing. I did took like five episodes for some people. I know, I know. I was in the minority of people. Lot of people got upset about that. But those people get upset about windows users tears this to, this defines, yeah, this is my charter

Speaker 6:          02:36:39       HBO time. It sound design in the cars fake. Hell yeah, they did. Beetlejuice is going to pop out of one of those buildings. Any seconds build up. Here we go. Some dude at synth in the studio is rocking. Whoa. Feel spacious. But Center at board it. And let's go into this hero. Yes. Oh Wow.

Speaker 7:          02:37:47       Factory period. Right there. I got to tell you that I have forgotten about that on 100% completely. That was what you were bringing it back. Sort of barely remembered and that great. But that was something that had been a wreath from my mind. Fuck yeah, we're bringing that bag. If we're doing a, we're doing a hardcore electronic, a double bass, just oh man. Yeah. That's all we're going to open this remix. Yeah. Wow. So you're going to, you're going to have this, you're going to have the VJ, you're going to have a what podcasts are going to perform. Uh, well, right now I'm just sort of leading the night, like a epic mealtime's coming with us for most of the tour. Hardly in the guys at mealtime. Brilliant Youtube series where guys like make like 900,000 Calorie burgers and pizza. So they'll go to every fast food restaurant and get one of everything on the menu, roll it up into a deep fried dough thing and then eat it and put Jack Daniels all over it.

Speaker 7:          02:38:33       Oh my. It's brilliant. It's a great, it's, there's epic music behind it. The cuts are great. They're buying 40 pounds of Bacon at the supermarket, filling up the shopping cart and just make these high caloric things and just eat them. So hardly came out at the first one. And we interviewed him and then we brought, we built like a youtube. Yeah, it's a great series on youtube. Better that or man versus food. I don't do man versus food. I do a, I do help to the kitchen for you. No, no, no, no. I do hell's kitchen. Hell's kitchen. Hell's kitchen is about as mainstream as it gets and it's fucking love that show. It's one of my favorites. I Love Gordon Ramsey getting pissed off about somebody. Risotto is the greatest moment in my life. I look forward to them making fucking horrible. Must it be for those dudes to go to or you're working at a restaurants?

Speaker 7:          02:39:12       I'm shit restaurant. He'd been working at the same shit restaurant forever. It's always been shit. He just fucking put out your Shitty Meatloaf, you know? Let me think about it. And also gorgeous kitchen. Nice. Right? Yeah. That's kitchen neck. God love that. I love how every single restaurant owner on kitchen nightmares truly believes they're not going to get raped by Gordon Ramsey. Yeah. And then they're just crying in the kitchen. Got It's powering into them over the oven. We've got a good salad. We've got a good dressing on a salad. These are good crew times. Yeah. Where do you store the salad or the trunk of my car. We thought we put ice in there once a week when we get new lettuce and they pull up like it's fine. Moldy things out of the frigerator. It's just for, it looks like cat mixed with how much of the staged it, none of it stage. No, no kitchen nightmares. Definitely not staged. I actually pawn stars and stuff his stage, but I mean, how many shitty disgusting restaurants are there in La alone that have C's in the window where you know there's just sour cream under a pile of dead cats in the kitchen. Like that shit exists right now. That's where we stored. That's where grandpa used to. Yeah. What do you have to do to get a d? Have you ever seen a dean at a dairy queen with a c ones? It was my first

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       week ever smoking pot and I, we made a trip five mile walk to a dairy queen with a c because I decided in an Oreo blizzard was our fucking holy grail and I shat myself senseless. Did you literally? Oh yeah. Immediately when we walked back and we were sober and I was like, that was a, well that was a trek and then immediately everybody who wait, they're like three other guys were like, ah, later bro. Everyone got sick. Everybody just, just screaming assholes. Wow. US. You have to really go out of your way to get a c. It's usually really in restaurants I've noticed and that's not to be racist or anything, it's just that that's what I've been because I'm like addicted to looking at the letters and every, almost every time I look it's always, and in restaurant that's like a B or a c.

Speaker 3:          02:40:53       People beat the drum for deregulation on everything and yet I wouldn't eat at a restaurant if half the restaurants, if I didn't believe that there was a solid blue letter in the window that was somehow certified and then someone was looking out for that. The fact that we don't want to, we don't want to monitor what goes into our food and how it's made and why it's made like people that are against labeling foods, those are assholes. Genetically Modified foods like they're like, you can't put that on the list. What the fuck? Can't you put it on the label? They're fighting it now they're finding it tooth and nail GMO foods, you GMO. Scary stuff,

Speaker 2:          02:41:23       man. This is all, I mean some of it can certainly help people. Sure, but some of it is real experimental. They don't know what the fuck's going to happen. 50 years.

Speaker 3:          02:41:31       The Shit. They're like, look, we tried it on a couple rats. Rats did. All right, how would we think it's safe now?

Speaker 2:          02:41:36       Crosspollination of other people's plants, you know, they're, they're genetically modified plants are getting into other people's crops and some that means people are getting sued for,

Speaker 3:          02:41:43       Oh yeah, you're Monsanto corn or yours. Your seed flew across the other highway and now I have your trademark corn growing in my field. It's what

Speaker 2:          02:41:51       Monsanto created, Agent Orange create a DDT like they created some seriously scary shit before they started fucking around with genetically modified.

Speaker 3:          02:42:01       Well, that's the really skin. That's the really scary shit. Yeah. That's what's crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:42:05       Well, not only that, there was speculation for a long time that they bought blackwater. You know, blackwater,

Speaker 3:          02:42:09       you mean XII? Yeah. Xxi I love how quick she to change to change it again.

Speaker 2:          02:42:14       Yeah. Agency or something like that. Something along those lines. But they were sold by someone in, the speculation was that they were sold by black water. They're sold through some private corporation and that was the, could you imagine if Monsanto bought black water? Like what if they bought their own mercenary group because you know they're, they have, they face like some serious resistance and other countries, especially in India, where in India that something like every 30 seconds a farmer commit suicide in India because he owes money to Monsanto, hundreds of thousands of farmers have committed suicide because they are involved in depth. They can't pay off and they just get fucked. I don't know why they have to make these deals with Monsanto. I don't know the intricacies of the corruption and how it's pulled off, but they developed this relationship or these people that that's where they're getting their seats from and they have to get their seeds from every year. Right?

Speaker 3:          02:43:03       Well isn't it that they sell them like a bacteria resistance, a strain or a roundup ready styles strain and they put that in, but it ends up killing other things or ends up generating its

Speaker 5:          02:43:12       own problems and how they got to buy the solution from Monsato as well. Like isn't that how that process works? At, they bury themselves in debt. I don't know. Think it is. I don't know, but there's a lot of issues to it. I mean, if he can go and read it, I get sad and I just stopped printing it and go to other things. When you hear that every 30 seconds of farmers committing suicide because of it in, well in Brazil, Brazil just sued Monsanto and farmers won. They won billions of dollars. Billions. I mean, what does that mean? I mean, does it mean that we have to go to fucking Brazil to get good food? Right. It means one less caviar ski do for somebody at Monsato who was already got billions of dollars. [inaudible] might not be a bad place to live. When the shit hits the fan, I would be down.

Speaker 5:          02:43:50       I love Brazil. Yeah. I'll just go get a fucking book on Portuguese. Do you speak, I don't use your dad's Portuguese. He is. Yeah. I told you he wears the bottle of your car. He's definitely a Portuguese. He's got thick black chest hair with like giant Golden Eagles and crosses dangling and do it. Really? Oh yeah. And a great pedo stash. The amber alert is strong with him. Really love him. Yeah. He's, he's full on Portuguese and shout it with bread rolls at his mouth. Does he know at family dinners? Has he been to Brazil? Um, and he's from the uh, A's or islands. Oh, that's the worst. Yeah. I saw a whole special Anthony Bourdain went there. Great cuisine there. Yeah. It's supposed to be amazing. Yeah. Amazing. It's a, it's a track that I need to take, but I want to take a road trip to Brazil.

Speaker 5:          02:44:29       So many Portuguese moved to Massachusetts and Rhode Island. What the hell is that about? And I was it proximity and just getting his in the first place you fly into massive amount live in fall river, Massachusetts. Fall River, Massachusetts is, do they have like, they have a lot of showing a lot of he beaded sweaters because that's why they would go down a bunch of different spots in Rhode Island. Um, there's like, there was like a whole towns where people talk Portuguese in Rhode Island, like a wound socket. I think that was it. Well, the socket was a part of Rhode Island where you would go and uh, it was like a portal, like a Portuguese fishing village. Crazy. Yeah. And I never got a, are you like in touch with your heritage? Are you really in touch with your heritage and your roots and your ethnicities and all that jazz?

Speaker 5:          02:45:12       It's where we have to wrap this one. Oh Shit. Three hours. Somehow or another, it gets too much time on the, the, the uh, audio and Fox on the other can say on the audience. I'm like, I can see that. Well, that to Jesus Christ, we can rambled forever. I would love, by the way, it was sincerely, if you will, let's figure it out. If you want to come on and do, if you want to try it on your, uh, your idea of doing like a Q and a kind of thing. If you want to do that. One of our shows or something like that out. But it would, it would have to be, you know, in a weekend I have off. Certainly, if that's the problem is most weekends I'm doing something. Gotcha. But I'm trying to do less this year. I've done less this year. I stopped doing, um, I don't do all the shows with the UFC anymore. I used to do all the paper views. Then I would do the spike shows and then they sold to FX and Fox and then they have these fuel shows. And so I don't do any of those. I want to do Fox and paper view. So I miss all, like there's a show tomorrow night. There's a, there's one that's going on tonight in San Jose. Uh, so the, the, the way in rather was today the fights or tomorrow night. So I'm missing that. Wanting to go to it or no, you're just, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       I'm trying to travel less. Yeah. I'm trying to do,

Speaker 7:          02:46:14       are you doing that so you can, what are you focusing that time on? Are you okay?

Speaker 2:          02:46:17       Cause somebody on his podcast and comedy, it's more fun to me. It's like the, the podcast, one of the things that's happened from the podcast is somehow or another, we've developed this gigantic group of people that are really into the podcast. And the rabbit. I'm one of them. And they, oh, thanks man. Absolutely. I listened to it every, all the fucking time. Oh, thanks. Yeah. So we owe them, you know, were, were linked. We, you mean they've been nice to us and we're the only ones who can make this podcast, so we owe them to keep doing this and it doesn't even feel like, like an obligation to me. It feels like a, like an obsession. Like I fucking love it. You know, like, it's like yesterday we had Tommy Chong today we got you. Tomorrow we've got this Adam called cash guy from Adam versus the man. I hope I'm saying his last name. Right. Um, but it's um, it's fun. It's, it's interesting. I'm learning a lot about, I'm not even a lot about fucking human beings. I'm learning a lot, listening to different people. So stories and yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:47:11       Experiences if I may. Like what are you think the overall takeaway has been because you've chatted with some diverse groups of people and had, you know, had some interesting like topics of conversation that, that repeat themselves from person to person. Is it, is there a common thread that has surprised you at all or is it pretty much what you figured when you were getting into it in terms of the way humans think, operate, communicate.

Speaker 2:          02:47:31       It's, it surprised me how much positivity can be generated inside of one group. That's what surprised me because that wasn't an intention. It wasn't intention to start this thing and uh, have all these people telling me that it changes our life and they become this really positive person and they're just started to cut out all the negative bullshit and their life and try to get a job they really want and try to be healthy. I never expected any of that. Awesome. That has been the most shocking storyline through the whole thing. This is just how I live my life and I've lived my life that way to try to manage my own reality and to try to, to try to live a happy existence. And what I've learned over the years is that the, um, the nicer you are to people, the happier you are, the more nice people you're around, the happier your life would be.

Speaker 2:          02:48:14       And if you all just come in, I've been a content my life. I think we all have had shitty moments where we just didn't have good control over our emotions or our state of mind or our tension level or whatever the fuck it was. It made you lash out when you shouldn't have or insulted someone when you could've avoided it or whatever the fuck it is that made you a contact person at the moment. We've what? We've all done that so we can all know that it's possible to aspire to a higher state of consciousness to a higher state of behavior, a higher level of behavior and that it makes you a better person and it enriches your environment. Like we all know the one person, like everybody has a friend that's like a joy to be around and he's like, look, Joey d is like a life of a party type dude.

Speaker 2:          02:48:54       Like you want to be around him because he makes you feel good because it's good feelings and you know, we all should have something like that. We all should have, you know, aspects of ourselves that we put out there that people like and they do the same and then we all benefit from each other. We all get inspired by each other and we all grow together and I think too many people are out there in this world thinking, you know, I'm going to pull, could be the bird is more the full girl and I'm going to fall. Could be the man. No one's over solds me took a does me. No one's ever sold as many records as me and no one's ever had as many downloads as me.

Speaker 5:          02:49:29       Your shit sucks because Ai, they can't make it myself or be, I'm trying to make it an insecure that it's better than my shit. Your Shit, your tastes

Speaker 2:          02:49:37       music. That is amazing. I don't like, you know, I know classical music is amazing, but I don't listen to it. You know, it's very, the only time I ever listened to classical music is, I'll put it in the background. Occasionally when I write, I'll have like a little classical music in the background if I feel like I'm into it. But for the most part I like, I like rock. I like old school rock. I like like Zeplin, like the door about dubstep. I'm not really into it. Oh Man.

Speaker 5:          02:50:00       Have you heard square Lexis doors song? Sounds cool. Sounds cool to me. It's like it's new metal to me. It has the aggression feeling that old metal used to give me. To me it's newer. I give it sounds like 40 Roombas raping robocop on in. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:50:12       that I don't like it. It's just that I prefer song. Sure. I prefer like the battle of Curtis Lowe to that. You know what I mean? And if I have to listen, I got to listen to something. Sure. You know, I can't listen to everything. I don't have the time. You know what I'm saying? I feel Kevin prayer. I love the fact that you have the balls to fucking jump off that show. Dude. It's a very successful show. You the starter of it, the creator of it. Thank you.
