Speaker 1:          00:00:00       What's the correct pronunciation of your last name? Dimmers. Dimmers, dimmers, dimmers. Works.

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       Ie. Yes. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:00:09       And we're like second podcast of 2016. Phil, how you feel about that? I'm ecstatic. Joy, I can't even begin to thank you for this. Honestly, if it wasn't for my having been on this podcast two years ago and returning now in a very timely manner, I think I'd be a fish out of water. What do you mean? Well, in terms of the cars that I sort of represent and all the multiple lawsuits that are levied against, uh, all the animal activists that you know, that I'm amongst. But let's explain to everybody who is unfamiliar. You, uh, had a lawsuit with a marine world used to work for marine world marine. Larry Marine land skews me, which is like seaworld for Canada, something like that type of thing. A type of seaworld. Seaworld is a day at the spa for animals compared to marine land. But yeah, really?

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       Oh yeah, it's that much worse. Significantly worse. So you worked for them. Um, you were released from your job fired as it were. I quit voluntarily. I quit amidst a. They say you're fired. No, no, no. Everybody admits her. Quit. I never gave him the opportunity to fire me. I made there were going to, I think that that's the inclination I had at the time. But you were a trainer and you, I think you opened up a lot of people's eyes to it. Um, this was, this was actually pre blackfish, right? This was pre blackfish. You came on. I, I, I ate pot candy and uh, was in Hawaii once, like many years ago and I hadn't experienced with dolphins were uh, uh, these dolphins were, we were fishing in. These dolphins were coming by the boat and they were jumping and playing with us and I remember thinking like this or they might as well be people, they might as well be like water people or something.

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       These are, there's something weird about this, like they're, they're enjoying playing with us. Like as we yell to them, they do more stuff. Like they came by and they were jumping and they were clearly looking at us when they jumped to the water and I'd never went to seaworld before because I had seen some documentaries on dolphins and I knew they were really smart and had seen some documentaries and orcas as well and it just always seemed really fucked up to me that they make them stay in these swimming pools. But when you came on the podcast two years ago and illuminated what it's like behind the scenes, at least that marine land, it was horrific. Man and I got a lot of tweets from people, um, and facebook messages that said they would never go to seaworld or marine land again. And then they realized really what it was.

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       Then the documentary blackfish came out and the whole world was sort of forced to take a look at this and understand that these animals are super intelligent just because they can't manipulate things just because they can't pick things up and they can't write their name. They can't send you an email in their environment that's unnecessary and environment. They're in the natural world. They're moving through three d space and the water, they have free food and fish. They have a huge community of fellow orcas and fellow dolphins and they communicate with each other through a very complex language that we barely understand. They have a fucking language, not like, like monkeys go, Ooh, and the other monkey goes like kind of a language. Now they have a complex language with dialects. They might as well be water

Speaker 3:          00:03:27       people. They've already evolved to be the top Predator of the sea, so there's no need for them to learn to email. They have no use for it, so they've all their already the the absolute top predators of the sea and that's a way to look at it, right? Like we have this kind of view of

Speaker 1:          00:03:42       our position being the top. Let mean we're kind of the top Predator, but we're only the top Predator because of our minds because we figured out how to manipulate things. They have huge minds, they have incredible brains, and then they're also. They eat everything they want. They don't need to evolve any further. They've sort of mastered there

Speaker 3:          00:04:02       and they're amazingly adaptable. They evolve in every which capacity to, um, to be able to, to, to adjust to the ever changing world killer whales now, uh, I recently watched the documentary and a on account of the melting ice in the Arctic in the summer. There's, there's, you know, the, the ice floes are receding, they're becoming smaller and smaller every year. So now orchids are now going into territories that they'd never had before. And you're in nun have documented that they've seen orcas actually hunt bowl whales, which are 50 ton larger than an ORC itself. And what they do is they isolate the animal. They bite their, uh, their, their fins, they hold them underwater while another oracle goes on top of their blow hole to try to drown it. I mean, this is amazing. Adapting. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       Jesus Christ. Well, that's where they got their name killer whales from killing whales. Yeah, exactly. A lot of people think they're a type of will there actually a cousin to a dolphin.

Speaker 3:          00:04:55       That's right. There are dolphins. They're just the largest dolphin and the Dolphin family, they just, they eat dolphins too, which is kind of fucked up. Killer whales, humans eat monkeys unbenounced to most killer whales are and you have to, you have to sort of disassociate things. You have to sort of draw a line between killer whales being cute and loving and just how you want to use the word statistic. They are, they are evil, evil, evil in the way that they hunt and kill. They are merciless, you know, well we have this idea of earth, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:05:29       I'm like, the smart things are supposed to be compassionate and we're supposed to be the stewards of the land and take care of the little chipmunks and all the other animals. But because we're so far ahead of all the other animals that we kinda. That's how, that's, you know, we kind of feel bad the way we treat each other. We want to kind of treat other animals that way, which is why, you know, animal rights organizations and all these, these, these people that really, really love and care about animals. That's where they sort come under fire because they, they want people to treat animals different than animals. Treat animals. Animals are fucking mean shit to each other. And that's just the way of the world.

Speaker 3:          00:06:06       One of the videos that stood out for me, and actually it was like a sort of a wake up call for me was just how was, how nasty nature is, and it was a video that you actually shared and it was of a bear taking down a deer yard.

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       Yeah, that guy's back. Yeah. I mean that's tough to watch, right? It is. It was screaming. The deer was screaming. The bear was just eating it like ferociously. Well, that's the thing about bears as opposed to cats. When a cat gets a deer, they go right for the neck and they kill it pretty quick because that's all they do. But bears do a lot of thing. They eat berries and roots and plants, so they don't always kill things. That matter of fact, they probably eat more plant matter then they do animal matter. So when they kill things, they basically just hold these things down and start eating. It's a question of opportunity, I guess, if it arises. Well, eat a lot of funds. That's a big issue in Canada where you're from, sir. That's right. They eat a lot of moose, moose calves and a deer fonds they eat them like as they're coming out, they actually smell the placenta and like the, the, you know, the, all the stuff that surrounds the baby and they'll find these moose as they're giving birth and just literally pull them right out of their body fucked up.

Speaker 3:          00:07:25       You know, I'm an animal rights activist by a, I suppose that's the label that I've been given, but I should mention that, uh, there are a lot of animal rights activists that owe you a great deal of credit for, uh, for your sort of, your, I want to use your sort of advocacy despite the fact that there are, there's a stark line between those who believe in not killing animals and everything else. But then there are also other people that can appreciate how nature operates. Predator prey relationship and can also appreciate that, you know, at least in what you've, what you've said before, you yourself are opposed to the captivity of animals. I mean, the last time we were on, you've mentioned of going to a zoo and maybe eating a cookie and having a look at the monkeys and being like, you know, you're throwing bose through animals and, and I very much respect the fact that the way that you hunt in the way that you eat is a kill what you eat, movement or whatever you want to call it. And as an animal rights activist I can say that that is a far more responsible way than, you know, want to take a look at the factory farming things and whatnot. But, um, uh, I forget. Shit, I forgot the point I was making. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:08:32       I know what you're saying. That it's sort of almost would seem like I'd be a against them in some sort of a way because I eat meat. But the reality is a lot of animal rights activists have fucking cats, man. And they feed their cats cat food. And guess what? That shit ain't grown on a cat food tree. You know, there's, there's a reality to the world. And cats are brutal. Cats are vicious little fuckers and they need protein and if you have a cat and I have two of them, I love them. They're awesome. They come cuddle with me and while I'm watching TV

Speaker 3:          00:09:00       on any given day, I've got five cats, three that I claim as my own too, that just sort of come and go at will wildcats. Uh, well. One is one of the neighbors sort of, I would say that he's sort of neglected it. And in terms of how you care for a domestic cat. Um, and when he moved away he said, look, you know, you, you take care of this cat, which I did. I'm on my second level balcony. I built this thing, I call it the Taj mckinney. It was this place where the cat could come live in the winter. Right? And it's real cold. And uh, so he said, you know, do you want to keep this cat? So I got it fixed and whatnot. And he likes to show his gratitude by bringing us a baby rabbits. If you've ever seen a baby rabbit, the cutest thing in the world. And he maliciously licks them down to the point of just chewing them until the sound stops and leaving them as gifts. And you can't help but love Eugene. Eugene is the is amazing and loving cat. He's also a just a cold blooded killer.

Speaker 1:          00:09:52       That's why they're alive. We don't want to think about it that way. But animals today that are alive today in 2016 are alive because their ancestors, especially predators, like cats were fucking vicious. They were vicious and ruthless and they made sure they killed everything they could because if you don't kill that little baby rabbit, the there might not be anything left for you to eat that day and you might starve or you might be too weak to get away from something that wants to kill you. Exactly. He might be too weak to get away from a bowl for you might be, you know, it's, we, we have a beautiful situation. We'd go to the store, we buy food that someone else killed for us and we can get it every time. It's not like a rare thing like you have to wait for it if you have to put in a lot of effort to get it throughout human history.

Speaker 1:          00:10:38       It's always been difficult to acquire food until recently. Recently it's become so ridiculous. You don't even have to get out of your fucking car to eat. You literally pull into a fucking drive thru you hand these people paper within seconds they hand you already cooked meat in a sandwich, a ground beef sandwich. You put it on your seat, they give you a glass of liquid sweet shit. He's stick that in your Little Cup holder and you're eating. That's insane. Never before in human history is that happened and that lack of effort and lack of connection has bred a lot of people that have a really distorted understanding of life itself. Love really distorted understanding of what it takes to make a ground beef sandwich. You know, if you want to raise a cow yourself and go through that whole thing. I have a few friends that do it. I have my good friend Doug in Wisconsin. He grows his own cows. They're all grass fed and he, he'll, you know, he gave me some, some meat from it last time I was there and he does it all himself. He shoots him himself. I mean he does the whole deed. He butchers them, he hangs them, the whole deed and that guy understands what it takes to make a ground beef sandwich, but most of us is pulling to that drive through.

Speaker 3:          00:11:55       I think it's a privileged perspective. It's people that have never had to do anything like that. Yeah. Put any effort in raising their food. I have friends that are farmers and it's the same story and they love and respect their animals through and through, but at the end of the day, they. It becomes a steak. It sounds like a contradiction, right? You know, loving your animal, put killing it. I think in defense of anyone that likes to call out hypocrisy is that you have to take a look at the fact that there's hypocrisy in absolutely everything you do. I mean the fact that loan that. And I'm going to use vegans as an example, if you, if you're going to look at what, what an abomination of nature is really the functions of society as a whole city, a city of physical city is an abomination of nature. Yeah. So if you're a Vegan and you're, for instance, renting an apartment and driving a car immediately, there's hypocrisy in that. And then this is not me calling out at the idea of living a compassionate life or propagating that. I think that's fine. I think it's great. I encourage that. I think the world needs more compassion, but uh, it's the judgment, right? It's the judgment. I think, uh, when you, when you start looking from the perspective of someone who's privileged, then yeah, the judgment.

Speaker 1:          00:12:56       But I mean, the judgment comes. I think a lot of it comes from a real place where people are like, fuck this factory farming shit. Fuck. People who eat meat, you know, they get, they get angry, you know, they love animals, but it's so hilarious when you have a cat that's feasting on a multitude of animals that have been raised in captivity. All of them being the way they raise animals. When you you're buying

Speaker 3:          00:13:18       food, man, you're buying like

Speaker 1:          00:13:21       the worst treated animals ever. I've never even heard of like ethically source cat food. I'm sure it exists. I'm sure I haven't heard about it. But even as it'd be sourced cat food, whatever, man, it's murder. If you feed your cats plants and there are people who do that. They have organ failure. They fucking get heart attacks. They die, they can't live. But there's a lot of people. There's a whole. I found these people because I found these people because they're hating on me after my last, a comedy central special where I did this bit about vegans. So, uh, whenever people get really mad at me, I like to go to their twitter page and read what they're into. It's like he's fucking people's twitter page and I found out that there's a whole Vegan cat forum, Vegan cat owners and you know, Hashtag cruelty free and these fuckers, they, they feed their cats plants and they don't live long. They die. I'd like to have a conversation with those cats. I mean, it would be nice if we could bridge that language barrier. Oh yeah. If you rolled a mouse by one of those cats, they would dive on it like a, like a dress, like a man in the ocean that just finally got to land.

Speaker 1:          00:14:27       Yeah. Like if you just barely made it this door, that feeling that you get when you get to land. Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:14:34       I think there's, there's, there's a line, there's a line in, in all advocacy where how far are you willing to go? And it's a question of it really. It's a question of how willing are you to sacrifice. I lived in South Korea for awhile and this is a country that was leveled back in the mid fifties. They had to rebuild from essentially nothing. And so I saw a, I mean I saw a pig heads being served up on the side of roads, but I can appreciate that these people had suffered so much so that they had to eat everything that was available to them and I don't want to sit here and defend that, you know? Okay. So South Koreans are eating dogs and whatnot. And you know, it's, it's symbolic of their history and whatnot, but if you've got nothing left to eat, I'd like to see how quickly your, uh, your ethics change, right? Because truly, if you are truly suffering

Speaker 1:          00:15:15       and a dog, I love dogs. I have two dogs, but let's be honest about what a dog is. A dog is a little captive pet. They're your buddies because you feed them and you take care of them and you have this relationship with them and you have this agreement with them. But if you ran into a wild dog, there was a couple, an elderly couple I want to say like maybe seven or eight years ago that was killed by a pack of wild dogs in Georgia, Georgia, United States Atlanta. Know that area. Of course, like what the fuck man? Like dogs will fucking kill you if they don't have any food. If you, if you think that they are like old yeller or lassie or some know what they are, is exactly how you treat them from birth. If you get a puppy like my dog johnny, I have a dog named Johnny cash.

Speaker 1:          00:16:01       He's the sweetest dog of all time. He is so nice. He's just so gentle. He's just, he's a mastiff and he's just so friendly. He just like anybody that comes over. I never worried about him barking at them or if he barks, it's like, hey man, come play with me, you know, and when you go up to and be like, what's up dude? And he's always like super happy and super sweet, but it's because I've had them from the time he was a baby. And the guy who bred him, um, he, he's always been like really ethical about how he breeds these dogs and they're very smart and kind. But it's because of the relationship that I had with him. He knows I'm the Daddy. I give him the food. I give them the love, you know, it's all this, this agreement as part of the revolution. I mean, there

Speaker 3:          00:16:40       they're physically cute on account of the fact that we selectively bred them through and they themselves learned that, hey, if I'm like really Das island cute, look what these big puppy dogs, I get more food and I get a better place to live and get more of a warm, a warm or shelter and I'm not likely to wind up in the backyard and winter, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:16:55       Well, there was actually a radio lab podcast. It was absolutely fascinating on raising foxes and they raised foxes. Yeah. You say Fox is right. It's not like dear. I think so, right? I'm not going to correct you. I'm goofy. Seems like fishes foxes. Fishes isn't acceptable word

Speaker 3:          00:17:16       if I'm not mistaken. Yeah. But you can use the word fishes. Really. I thought there was a large debate about this and this was figured out back in the mid nineties. I started this as part of my.

Speaker 1:          00:17:23       You might be right. I don't know. Um, but anyway, the radio lab about foxes, they selectively bred fox is based on their behavior based on whether or not they were aggressive in the ones that were aggressive. They killed and the ones that reacted a certain way, I don't remember the actual parameters that they set, but ultimately what it was, and if you're into this google it because I don't remember the name of the episode, but it was amazing. Within a few generations, like within less than 10 years, they had completely changed with these foxes looked like their ears had become droopy. Their jaws would become less pronounced and smaller. Their behavior was markedly different. They were literally were almost a different species and it was within 10 years. Things adapt and change and that's the reverse to that is, and I think I heard on your podcast, is that if you were to release a wild or rather a pig and then it eventually starts growing hair again and like maybe protruding some tests because I'm out of six weeks.

Speaker 1:          00:18:21       Yeah. Within six weeks, a fucking month of a pig living in the wild and all of a sudden their hair starts growing thicker and longer. Their nose extends, their tusks grow larger. They become a different thing. They literally start to. They start to adapt to the, the, the, the, the physical shape of wild pig like, have you ever been around wild pigs here? So not, it's really interesting. First of all, they're all, there are, a lot of them are black. They're like a dark, dark color. And I'm not even talking about boards I'm talking about, right. Well, we think of bore. What is a board is actually the term for a male pig. Okay. So when you see, when people go to a menu and it says wild boar sausage, is it really? How do you know? It's not a wild girl, you know, it might be a sow like the word, but it's a, it's an ignorant terminology.

Speaker 1:          00:19:10       But then there's these Russian bores is a different type of bore that lives in other countries. I don't know exactly what the genius is, what the name is, but the crazy thing is they're all interchangeable. There are other can all breed with each other. They're all the same thing. Ultimately there's dodgy crossbred all the time to sort of like pull out the, uh, uh, the, the, the advantages that we're looking for when we're breeding them so you can make a, I know they were breeding I and I don't know, I can't remember where now, but uh, they were selectively breeding this hunter have a dog and they just made this mammoth machine but also a domicile, domicile and trusted creature. So I wish, I wish I remembered where I, where I read that. Yeah, there, um, I mean it's, it's amazing that dogs are a lot like people in that way that there's a lot of different variations of people.

Speaker 1:          00:19:59       No, I mean you've got Shaquille o'neal and then you've got a Natasha Leggiero, right? Little Tiny Natasha. She's a comedian. She's a 100 pounds, but as you know, there's people very almost as much as dogs do in that sense. You know, we're, we're all sorts of different shapes and looks and. But my point being wild animals, like a feral cat. I've had feral cats before. I had a feral cat and he was fucking nuts. Did you actually get near him? I could only me, like literally only me, no one else could get near and he would hiss and fucking run away. He would hiss at me half the time, but if I approached them real slow, but once I picked him up, oh my God, he would start preparing like crazy in fact alone that you got close enough to be able to pick them up as a pretty rare.

Speaker 1:          00:20:46       Well, what I did was I tamed him and it was a weird way. My friend Lanie, um, her boyfriend and her, uh, lived in this apartment and they had, um, down below I went to high school with her and down below their apartment they found a cat that had given birth to a litter of wild. And this is like Santa Monica. So they're like, oh my God, what are we going to do? So they decided to capture these cats and try to get them home. So me and like the asshole that I am. I said, all right, I'll take it. So I took one of them. I brought them home and he was. So I thought, oh, he's a kitten. I'll bring them home and hang out with my cat. Everything will be cool. And I had two cats at the time and he was so fucking different than them.

Speaker 1:          00:21:27       He was like, he'd look at you just fucking jump up. Five, six features mentally different. Oh my God. He was so scared of everything. He was terrified. It was. Everything was a legitimate life or death struggle. So, uh, I did. The Internet wasn't around back then, so I was trying to figure out like, okay, how the fuck do I do this? I got to get to know this little dude. So yeah, I food and what it did was I uh, took this room in my house. I put a bed in there. It's like a guest room. Sir had bad in there. But uh, I decided it's going to be my room now. So a close myself in there, put a litter box in there. I brought some books and hung out with his fucking cat for two days. You're brave, dude, man. This cat, I think cat attack humans.

Speaker 1:          00:22:09       And it's a violent man. He was a kitten. It was a baby. It was a baby, I would have never done this with full blown can. You can, you can't. Full blown cat. You just can't. You can't train them. He was only, he was a little tiny thing. So what I did was, uh, I would, I would pet him and he per like crazy and then when I put him down he will hiss at me and run away. Like he was so fucked up and I mean he would jump. He would say he fucked up my curtains, jumped through the air and grabbed the curtains and was like trying to climb them and shit. It was like out of control. It's like, dude, I was just petting you a few seconds ago, but the life or death struggle that these things were involved in even whatever he got from his mom and his dad, like the genes that were passed down, their genes have wild animals that were really scared of everything and trying to survive.

Speaker 1:          00:22:55       So he thought he was about to get eaten, but it became my little buddy. Yeah. Took a while. Was there an element of you that's sort of loved the fact that it was bad ass and scratching your curtains that shit or you're like, no, I hate it. It was fascinating. It was like, like I'm, I'm a big fan of just the idea of wildlife, you know, I think we live in cities and living in cities and driving cars and sleeping and nice houses and you know, having a yard, it's probably as close to a lot of people get to nature on a daily basis. They got a tree and some fucking grass in the yard when you're out in wild and you see wild nature. One of the most fascinating things about hunting is not just the pursuit of an animal that you're going to eat, but it's also spending a lot of time out there in the real wild.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       Like the real while we're fucking elk lives, you know, we're a thousand pound animal lives its life with fucking trees growing out of his head and wanders through the forest and couple weeks a month out of the year gets to fuck. And the rest of the time it's just running from danger and eating, fighting. It's massively interesting. Not the slightest clue. Native of the modern world, you know, couldn't care less. All it cares about is doing what it naturally does to stay alive. And that's really where animals should be. Yeah, I mean, that's the premise of, uh, of, of what we're sort of dealing with that it's just so fascinating when they're there. Um, I encourage everybody. I mean, zoos are bullshit, man. They're bullshit. They give you a stupid idea of what an animal is. It's just a business. They're there to make your money. They're not in reintroducing animals into the wild there.

Speaker 1:          00:24:33       There's no program. I mean, I don't want to say there's nothing that I'd like to hope that there are some programs where they help animals and then you know what it is. It's like there's, there's some animals that are so far gone and needs so much help that it actually, it benefits them to have some of them in captivity just so they can keep a breeding population alive. But ultimately, does that breeding population get reintroduced into wild in any capacity? Some of them, in some cases, they've done it with tigers. I know they've done it with some animals. It's hard. You know, it's fucking hard. I mean, I'm not. I'm not sliding in any way. People who care about wild animals. I absolutely care about wild animals. I think it's made people think you don't. If you're a hunter, you eat and I get it.

Speaker 1:          00:25:13       I understand. I understand where they're coming from, but this is how I try to look at it. Those animals are going to die no matter what. Every they're all going to die. They're not going to live forever. I'm not talking about wiping out populations with hunting. It's not. I'm not doing that and I don't think any hunters are trying to do that. In fact, what hunters are trying to do and what they have done, there's more deer in North America today than they were when Columbus landed. And the reason is a bunch of things, but a big part of it is wildlife management. The wildlife agencies, like department of fish and wildlife in in America, department of fish and game, they're. They're very careful about how many deer they allow people to take and there's consequences for poaching, like stiff consequences. They put you in jail and because of these rules and enforcing these ethics, they've allowed these animals to grow in massive numbers and then of course there's also agriculture.

Speaker 1:          00:26:05       Agriculture contributes to them a lot. Like the most deer population or the biggest deer population in America is usually around people. It's usually in people and farms. Some of the biggest deer in the world, like Iowa and Kansas, they're known for like the biggest deer in North America. Canada is actually known for the biggest ones, but that has to do with cold temperatures, creating larger body to animals because they have to generate more heat to stay alive, but my point is I'm not a hater of animals exist just because I kill them and eat them. In fact, I love them. I really do. It sounds. I get it. I know it sounds contradictory, but what you're. When you're eating an

Speaker 4:          00:26:43       animal is almost like a sacred thing. When you hunt an animal and you kill and you eat it, it sounds like such a hippie horseshit or some pseudo spiritual horseshit, but it is kind of sacred. There is something that happens when I Cook a steak of an elk that I ate and I grilled that thing and I eat it. There's A. There's a connection that I have to that meat that's. It's crazy. It's an environment of different levels. I don't know if the word earned. It is the correct word for it. I'm connected to it. Sure. You know, I'm connected to that animal. I'm connected to where this meat comes from. I know that that animal ate from the grass, you know, in the forest, and then I killed it and now I'm eating it and this was like this weird, crazy cycle, but I grew up on a moose meat.

Speaker 4:          00:27:30       My Dad was a hunter, avid hunter. He went out there. I mean a nice stock photo recently. If a kid up on that microphone, my friend, so pull it towards you could pull it towards the back. I saw a photo recently have my dad back, it has to be in the eighties and he took down a bull moose. I mean this was a massive animal and the, the, the best of my recollection was just eating that animal. So I mean even the fact alone that I'm a meat eater and you know, people rarely now back in 2012, this is a different story, but you know, there's been a largely a paradigm shift in how we view animals, especially captive animals, but that was called out quite a bit for being a hypocrite. Oh, you eat meat or you got leather shoes and it says as if my message is worth nothing.

Speaker 4:          00:28:06       It's like, well, you're not paying attention to the, to the core of my message, like stop attacking the Messenger and that's the sort of defense I have against people who like to call hypocrisy in everything. Do you eat fast food and like store bought food? Yeah, on my, at my weakest moments and admittedly a week, man, I tried, I tried not to. And last time I was on the show, I had stressed that, you know, I, I tried to get away from pork and still I tried to make an ethical decision as possible, but not at three in the morning, you know, it just, it happens. It was just like last night we were driving around with cruise around, we needed to eat and we found our food and we gave them that paper money and I slept better. So it's tricky, right? It's tricky trying to stay alive.

Speaker 4:          00:28:44       And the last time I was on the show, I had actually mentioned that I was, uh, had a hard time getting off cheese. And it's recent. It's interesting because recently I read a study that cheese may very well, uh, react to you or your mind may actually react to cheese. Similarly to crack that it was, I wish I could quote it better again, I'm not a scientist, but I did read this article and it said that the more processed that a food is, that it creates some type of fat that your brain itself becomes addicted to it. And they actually referenced an addiction to crack. And that it was similar. Look at this. Cheese really is cracks. Jamie, you're on the ball. You need a raise change. She's really, it's crack steady reveals cheese is as addictive as drugs. That is fucking insane. Well, you know what that makes sense because it tell you what Anthony Bourdain, um, that motherfucker loves cheese and he's a, had notorious substance abuse problems in the past.

Speaker 4:          00:29:34       But I've fucking hung out with him, man. The way he talks about cheese is a way young 22 year old guys talk about pussy now you, it's like, oh my God, stinky cheeses. Stinkiest the better. Pull that up so I can understand that. Jamie, let me, let me pull it. Pull it up so the techs could read. This is fucking nuts. For years you've been telling your friends family cohort, what is the title of this? That it's from the La Times food daily dish by Jenn Harris. And uh, it says for years you've been telling your friends, family, coworkers, and anyone who will listen to that. You're addicted to cheese. It's part of every meal or snack. And you think about it constantly. A few studies suggests that food addiction is a real thing. The study published by the US National Library of Medicine examines why certain foods are more addictive than others.

Speaker 4:          00:30:21       Researchers identified addictive foods from about 500 people who completed in the Yale Food Addiction scale, Huh? Okay. It's p achieves happens to be specially addicted because of an ingredient called caisson. Okay. It's a protein found in all milk products during digestion case. Am I saying that right? Case in C, a s e I n releases opiates. Whoa. Called casomorphins. Holy Shit. Opiates get released when you eat cheese. Really play with the dopamine receptors and trigger that addictive element. Wow, that's amazing. People are gonna. Start putting some crafts. Synthetic cheese and syringes. I don't know what I've been eating lately. I've been eating raw cheese, beginning raw cheese from the whole foods. Whole foods has the raw cheese which made with raw milk. It's fucking great. It's really good. Raw milk is great too. That's the thing I've gotten away from the most. I growing up, I drank a lot of milk, a lot of milk.

Speaker 4:          00:31:17       I would say more than the average person. Now I can't, I can't stomach it. Burleson milk. Yeah. I just can't. I have no urge for it whatsoever. Now just so how do you eat cookies? Okay. There's the window. Hypocrisy comes in, right? The largest hypocrite I admitted. Yeah, so you're right. So I guess I do have, I do have a different course. I, I, and I, I've heard on the podcast before and I'm going to accept some of the judgment that's going to come from it, but I've made the switch to almond milk and feel free to rant about how bad almond milk is for a, a, the environment a for all the almonds that are being wasted and the water use and everything else. I mean there is a perspective that people like to say, Oh, almond milk, that's a healthy alternative. But if you look at it from the other side, the environmental impact, everything else, almond milk shit.

Speaker 4:          00:32:00       So. Well it's not bad. It's just what almond milk. Here's one thing that everybody needs to consider when you buy almond milk and it tastes good. It's like, oh, this is so sweet. Look at the fucking label bitches. All right, because guarantee that shit is filled with sugar. Duncan called me up, dude, I've been drinking almond milk. It's amazing. It's so delicious. I go, okay, what? What? What kind of drink? And he tells me that I go look at the label and look how much sugar is in it. He goes, Holy Shit. He's like 18 grams. I'm like, yeah, every class is 18 grams of sugar. All right. That's a whole lot of sugar. I think you're not supposed to have like if you're trying to be healthy, I don't believe you're supposed to have more than 25 grams of a day.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       I think there's like a limit where you hit a limit and if you go over that you're like, Whoa, you're fucking with your body there and this dude's getting most of that from a glass of supposedly healthy almond milk. Well, I don't drink a lot of it admittedly, but tastes the alternative. Yeah, I think it does taste good. That's kind of nutty flavor. It's got a nice texture. What can I say? It's, I'm really bad when you're in a place like California, which is normally how experiencing a drought today. It's porn like fucking crazy. We're in the middle of the Nina. I around know if you'll know theses Nino and it's a fix. Do you want to warm the water? You'll think they do. There's no consequences to your actions. Danielle is ia. It couldn't wait three days for me to go. No, it's good.

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       It's good. I like it. I like watching all these fucking dummies who have no idea how to drive when it rains out. Oh, that's one of the things I loved about when I lived in Colorado for the brief time when it would snow. It's like, ah, yes. I love a little consequences for living on earth and nature is a thing that we avoid in California. We have avoided it. It's doesn't. It barely exists. When we go to the ocean. I'm like, Whoa, cool. Nurture. That's the only time you know you can go visit it. You can go to the park and visit it, but it doesn't rain. There's no. Whether it's no consequences. I feel like water probably in California as some, in a way, the glue that's going to keep the ground together because you guys are bad ass drought. I've seen these before and after pictures and I'm like, wow.

Speaker 1:          00:34:07       And I remember when I was repeatedly asking you to come back in the show, I'd be like, I got to get down there before California runs out of water. We're not out a water. We're right next to the fucking ocean. They just need to figure out a suck that water out of the ocean. Get the salt out of it. It's it. Look what if we could put people on the moon, how the hell can we not get salt out of the fucking water? It's to just stop making smaller phones. Stop adding new TV channels to DIRECTV. Figure it out. You fucks. Just get in there and suck that water out and let's turn this bitch knew a rain forest. Starts praying that shift from the sky hollows chem trail, planes and all these Wackos or worried about, let's have those fuckers for real. Just fill them up with water and just dump it on us.

Speaker 1:          00:34:48       Just get those giant planes filled with water and just dump water and everybody, surely a million dollar idea. Uh, I think it probably costs a little more than that, but I was thinking of the earnings if you can manage to figure out how to, how to extract that. So they actually have, um, a desalination plant that they are going online with this year, I believe in San Diego. Is that this year? Do you know that story? Jamie? Um, there was a, uh, there apparently they do have emerging technologies to extract salt from water and they've used them in the Middle East where they just have ungodly amounts of money. You know, they just have so much money over there because of the oil that some of these, some of these dudes have, uh, tried to use that money to create machines that can suck the salt out of the water and figure out some way to filter it. Bill Gates can drink water from his own shit. You'd like to think that someone could do what he's doing.

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       What he did, he'd been invented a machine that we extracted water from human shit. And then he was like, from actual shit from like think it was, I think it was shit, we'll use the word sewage just for the sake of making a little more broader spectrum of. Well that's what you do when you have $90,000,000,000 bold. Everybody's getting Fiji and heavy on. And I heard Fiji's not even really from Fiji. Those fucks I heard. That's bullshit. Yeah. I heard Fiji is just some fucking. Just some spring water from the middle of nowhere. Plant opened up December 14th. Oh, did open up. Okay. So went online at the end of 2015. That's interesting. It's good. Huge developments. That's gonna happen. That's gonna. Fix the whole fucking problem. We're going to go Jesus Christ. Why we were right next to so much water. You have to fly over it in a fucking plane and it takes 16 hours to get to the other side.

Speaker 4:          00:36:27       And I'm just going to. And I'm going to plead ignorant here, but why are we not just showering with saltwater, maybe extinguishing fires with saltwater. Why are we not using the salt water in different capacities that we're not imposing so much? Good question to, to, to process it. Um, uh, the thing about saltwater is it does corrode things like really badly if you're near the ocean. Uh, I have a friend who has a beach house and every time we go to hang out with them and his beach house, like everything's like all fucked up and corroded. Like they're constantly dealing with corrosion because of the salt in the air. It's just a constant moisture and salt together. They corrode the shit out of things. That's why I'm. Why used to live in Boston? The uh, cars are always fucked up like old cars. It's hard to find like if you want to find like a 1970 plymouth or something like that, it's hard to find one that's in good shape because they're all rusted out from the salt that they throw in the ground when it, when it snows out to melt the snow.

Speaker 4:          00:37:19       So that's why my cars were all fucked up. Right. So the point being almond milk, the problem with almond milk, because it uses a lot of water, they use a shitload of almonds. I guess you're extracting very little of the, of the nutritional value from the almonds per capita if you will, like versus like this mass amount. Right? But writing it down or what? That's what I say, dude, fuck them. Okay. So I'll eat almost all day. Not Care about their life. That's the thing about life. We don't really. We don't really care much about plant life. We want it to be there, but we don't think about it the way we think about animal life. Like we want animal life to be there, but we don't want anybody to kill it. Like plant life. The only time people get bummed out about plants and someone chops down ancient redwood or something like that.

Speaker 4:          00:37:58       Like, Oh God, how could you. And again, I've read somewhere where plants can actually hear when they're being eaten and I've seen some studies, or rather I read something somewhere again, where a plant has a similar hunting behavior as animals, where they're actually the roots will physically chase or get fined their nutrients. So, you know, some would argue that, uh, that plants are just as conscious or conceivably conscious as a, as animals as well. Well, they're different in the same way that humans are different than dolphins. We were talking about the intelligence level of an Orca versus the intelligence level of a person. Like we would like to think that we're smarter

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       than them, but there's no evidence of that. If we lived in the ocean, we would look like fucking idiots if we were swimming around with them trying to stay alive, they'd be like, look at these dummies with their fingers and they're exposed. Dick's, he's going to eat by crabs. These fucks, they can't even sleep in the water. Like what are they going to die? They would think we were retarded. Right? So that's sort of how you know when we look at their life and what they're doing, like they're perfectly adapted to their environment. Well, a tree is perfectly adapted to it's environment and there's been a lot of research done on plant intelligence and there is a lot of evidence to suggest that these aren't inanimate objects like a rock. It just happens to get larger every year. No, these are living things. They're living things that do calculations that somehow or another communicate with each other.

Speaker 1:          00:39:29       They let other plants know when they're being preyed upon. They develop methods in order to discourage predation and that's where poisonous plants come from. All poisons. Plants come from discouraging predation. That's what. That's what it's all about. It's funny because one of the cruelest things I've ever watched, and maybe it's because I have a vivid imagination, but if you've ever seen a venus fly trap, it's like slowly dissolve. You know its prey. It's like wild shit. Pretty evil. Yeah. Well there's one that aedes rats, there's a fucking plan. The Amazon that looks like a giant tulip that each route. Pull that up, Jamie. A rat eating plant and it's, it's a plant, it's like it has like a sickly sweet smell to it apparently, and these animals go in it looking for food and they go and just close in on them and they don't fight and kill them.

Speaker 1:          00:40:23       They slowly enveloping, just smush them, just trap them, smash them, and then absorb their nutrients, break them down to the very molecules and protein and liquids are going to get 250 people would sign out of plants. Doorstep, protest them. Well, plants are alive, man. We need to eat living things. Life eats life live feeds on life that it just does. And what's going on now with animal rights, activism and pita and the Animal Liberation Organization is people who care. That's what really is. Whether they're misguided, whether I agree with him. There are people who care and there are people who feel deeply about these animals. Check this motherfucker out. Watch this shit. That's hunting behavior for sure. Look at this case will be fishing. What happened? We went, here we go, here we go. So this thing, um, it, it has like this open leaf. And these plants, what are we watching here? This is like a fast speed up version of it. So what happens is, um, is it growing here? Is that we're watching. I thought final countdown

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       was about to play it that way too quick. It was just a mouse falling into a plant. So I didn't want to go with that. And this one was a guy in front of one, but this is, um, we're watching the whole fucker grow. This isn't. So this is what happens. This is, this is where it is. It opens up and it looks like almost like a hamper. We throwing a closing or something or strange green vagina. And that looks like a snake. Like that's crazy. Yeah. Well there's a lot of that in the animal world. Um, this is all just growth though. We're watching like high speed rail. We're not gonna watch it, eat anything. Jamie. We're going to have to find another video. When these things open up, they open up and the rats are attracted to the smell and they climb in that tube and when they climb in that tube, they wind up dying.

Speaker 4:          00:42:16       Show the one that, uh, that has a hair goes eatsa fraud. Here. Go. This is perfect. This is the one that's just going to close right up on it. It already did. Jamie. Just watched this. Just do it from the beginning. Here it goes. Watch this. He's just hanging out. Like, what's that smell? Let me just blew up and that it eats him. It's over. Yeah, it eats a. and this is a new plant. They've only discovered this fucker I think like five or six years ago. And um, eat frogs, all sorts of things. Look at this. Watch this because this Venus flytrap. Wow. That's a wrap. Bitch. That's cold blooded. That is so fucked up. Play that again. Could God that fucking frog. Okay. He's like, what's the smell? So I bought. That is so crazy. I said it's one of the. For me anyways.

Speaker 4:          00:43:03       That's one of the toughest things to watch. I think it's ours. That poor animals are going to be just laying there a incapacitated until ultimately wow. If it's suffocated than it is what it is. No. A Venus flytrap could do that. I didn't know the Ada frog. Is that a different plant or is that a Venus flytrap? It looks like the fingers. It's just. I know that's what those plants have figured out is their method to get ahead. That's their hustle. There. Hustle is they trap things and they suck them into their body and they eat them. They survived. They evolve and get bigger. Get stronger. Yeah. Those are predators, man. These are carnivores. So look at these. Look at these fucking hands getting killed by this plant. Oh my God. There's so many of them, man. There's so many different. Weird one. Look at this. They roll up these ants. Oh, this is so creepy. It looks like a giant green tongue with like weird sort of spikes that grow on it and the spikes lift up and wrap around the aunt or the fly here in this case and just trap them and once they have them trapped in there and he's stuck in the stickiness of the. Look at this with these ants and then it wraps up and rolls them up like a Burrito.

Speaker 4:          00:44:18       That's fucked up, man. That was a tough place here. It doesn't give a fuck, but I think nature is beautiful. I think it's amazing. I think if you really want to see nature of the weight of see it is obviously documentaries and dvds if you want to stay in home, but

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       to actually see the physical animal go somewhere, go somewhere and see them, go see them in their natural environment. That's what you're going to get a real respect for them. Absolutely. Yeah. I'm taking one of my upcoming trips this year. I want to take my kids with me. I'm not when I kill an animal because I don't want to make any noise. I don't want to have to quiet them down because it's a very patient thing and it's something that will be very hard for a five year old to do. Would you take issue with them seeing the kill itself? No. They've watched it on TV. They've seen the meat, they've seen me butcher meat. They haven't seen me kill the whole animal, but they've seen me chop up a giant elk backstrap and turn it into steaks in the middle of the kitchen just sitting there with a cutting board, slicing it up and they ask questions and there's a disconnect between that meet having been a live animal.

Speaker 1:          00:45:19       No, no standing. Well, they've seen me on television kill animals on a TV show. Okay. So they know that I do it. They know that I have targets in the yard and I'm always practicing arrows and archery. But um, I want what I want to do is not, not even the hunting aspect of it. I want to take them so they could see the elk when elk are running and they're screaming is amazing. It's like you're in Jurassic Park. It's like you run some hobbit movie or something when you're in the hills. Like, um, what I want to do is I'm going to, I want to plan a week of hunting and then I want to pay a guide just to call in the elk so we could just watch them because I just want the kids to see what it's like when you make this noise and then you see this fucking thing looks like a giant forest horse that comes up and wants to fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:46:09       And they're screaming. They have this crazy whale. It's, it's amazing to watch outside of hunting, like separate that, that's, that's all great and everything, but just be just being a part of the environment, like stepping on the ground where these things live wild and they all they're worried about. It's like mountain lions and bears and that's what they're doing. They're trying to stay alive. They're trying to get laid and they're, they're existing in this very bizarre world that we rarely get to see that we can't really truly appreciate it because we don't have to worry about it. We don't have to worry about what their concerns are anymore. We even like, look at Africa, man. They have these tourism things they do in Africa, but a good percentage of them are in these high fence operations where they've sort of fenced in these animals and these giant contained wildlife sanctuaries and the animals thrive in there. But how do you see, you mean the way you see him as he get in a jeep and you drive around and even if it's something, there's something fucked up about knowing that they're not, they can't leave even if it's like 10 miles in every direction, there's a fence and they would never Rome 10 miles in the wild. The fact that there's a fence at all, the fact that we've gotten are greasy little hands or in their world, it kinda changes it in a way. Well, it's funny because I actually a running

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       deer, a male of course, uh, trying to enter the premises of marine land and there's a large fence around it and this thing was. So. I mean, uh, running deere is actually a pretty dangerous animal. I mean, they are, they are there. Their sexual urges are far beyond any type of. Like it just trumps any behavior that they would have. So this thing was smashing, it must've been smelling the females inside the park, but it was repeatedly smashing itself against the fence trying to get in to the point where he'd ripped half its face off, its antlers were getting fucked up. So we actually called a hunter who had been in the back like, who had had the, the permission by the owner of Greenland to hunt inside some wild deer. And we went and got him and he came, put the first boat directly through the animal, didn't kill it, got a second bowl and then uh, took, uh, put the animal down and won't kill it.

Speaker 4:          00:48:15       And then we had to sausage some, some time later. Of course. Yeah, they get crazy. Moose are super aggressive when they get horny, they're dangerous. I've been in Algonquin Park at the times when, uh, when uh, the Moose are running. And that is by far the most dangerous animal out there for you. I mean, you don't want to get anywhere near a running moocs. They're so big. Have you ever seen one in the wild? I have, yeah, of course. The first time I saw one out in the wild was in the middle of British Columbia in the forest and it was like the first one I saw it was a female and we saw them in the distance and I was like, oh my. It was like that scene in Jurassic Park where Jeff Goldbloom lifts his head up out of the jeep and it's like, what? Like, you can't believe how big they are.

Speaker 4:          00:48:57       They're like the males get to 1800 pounds, 1800 pounds. Like the biggest elk that I killed was around a thousand pounds. So imagine something fucking twice the size of that. Drive your car. Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah. Well my friend, my friend Mike Hawk Ridge who runs a big country outfitters up there, he got chased by a female Moose on a horse. He was on his horse and the female had the caps with them, which is when they get really fucking dangerous and they get aggressive and the horse was running in the fucking moose was gaining on them and he was like, Holy Shit. And he realized like, Oh my God, like this is fucking, this could be good to the horse. Kept his cool or kept it its footing at least that have fucked up scene. Oh yeah. Well if the horse slipped and fell or if the horse said, fuck this guy on my back like I'm out. I don't think he could. I mean he had a saddle and everything like that. I don't know if the horse was that smart point to what we're saying is a almond milk is bullshit. That's, that's the bottom line. Almond milks sucks. It's all right. So, um, what has changed since the two years that you've been here? Other than there's a lot of public acknowledgement and understanding now that wasn't available or wasn't. It sort of wasn't at the level that it is now. I think people are much more outraged now about seaworld and about a marine land and just the idea of captive orcas and dolphins. And in your case walruses well. So the first thing we did was we managed

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       to ban a orchid captivity in Ontario. That's, that's done now. So marine land will never. And Mark my word, they will never acquire another, a killer whale, whether it be a wild caught or not. So that was a big win for animal activists, if you will, or anyone for that matter has invested interest in the wellbeing of animals just as of January first 2016. Now, uh, there are standards of care, which is what I actually petitioned the government for back in 2012 because when I came out and sort of revealed marine land for what it actually is behind the scenes, uh, during that time, there were no standards of care. You could literally have dug a hole in your backyard, fill it with whatever you want and then, you know, plunk yourself some dolphins in there. And that was fine. There were no standards of care.

Speaker 3:          00:51:11       There was no, uh, oversight in any capacity. That's changed. I'll be at the letter of the regulations that we have now. I would say that few people are really satisfied. There's still lots of work to do with them, but the fact alone that they are now legislated, we'll be able to, uh, to change some of the, the, the, the parameters, you know, the one of the biggest things that there's in fact water quality parameters. Uh, when I, in the last eight months of my tenure at marine land, I was witnessed to, um, some of the more horrific things that a, that caustic water can do to animals. Uh, I witnessed dolphins lose their skin. I mean the skin was flaking off, literally flaking off their skin and we're not talking about it. Just a regular slough. Uh, there was some permanent idemage that was done.

Speaker 3:          00:51:52       What happened was there was, there was a breakdown in a disinfection unit, a water disinfection unit. We used to use ozone in conjunction with chlorine. Ozone mitigated the use of chlorine, so he didn't have to use so much of it. And when that machine broke down, the resolve was just keep pumping more chlorine and keep pumping more clearance flirting. And because we were in the off season, the public wasn't seeing this. Okay. And this is 2012. I had an old shitty blackberry, but I knew I was conscious enough of how bad things were that I started snapping photos, taking videos and you know, there was a major complacency for management because hey shit, we're not opening again for another eight months or six months, whatever it be. I think the issue started in October. They opened in November and so there were no parameters. There was no oversight.

Speaker 3:          00:52:32       There was nowhere for me to run to find help. Now there is that. So now marina has to adhere to new legislation that will require some capital investment from them, which of course is something that we'd like to hear, um, but there's at least some stuff in place. And most importantly is most recently there's a senator, a federal Canadian senator, a liberal senator by the name of, of uh, Willie Moore is what we're actually the Hashtag. We're saying free willy more and sort of a in the hopes of getting Justin Trudeau's attention. And he's introduced the bill. It's called the ending of captivity of whales and Dolphins Act. It's a bill, a two. Oh, three, I believe, and uh, this bill, once it passed the Senate and ultimately passes into law, is going to ban both the import, the breeding of all whales, porpoises captivity or rather, and whales in captivity in Canada.

Speaker 3:          00:53:27       Basically putting a shelf life on marine land in the capacity that they, that they do business. Now, this is a bill that I'm urging people. Look if you, if you give a shit about animals in captivity, you know, a tweet, Justin Trudeau are our recently elected prime minister. And uh, yeah, we're, we're really trying to, we're looking forward to moving this thing forward. Beyond that, it's always a, it's always a thing about the, the what I call the paradigm shift. Um, people don't want to see the only visit zoos, no more attendance at marina is a nihilistic. Now this doesn't stop him from exacting a gross revenge on me, but nonetheless, we're still afloat. We're still here three years later amidst all these bullshit lawsuits as I stressed before, these slapp lawsuits, strategic lawsuit against public participation when I got sued, well had hope to one day we'd be in court.

Speaker 3:          00:54:16       Here we are well over a thousand days later and not, and I've spent, well I say I've spent, but we've publicly raised a lot of money. We spent collectively over the three former animals trainers that are turned whistleblowers. We've collectively spent over $100,000 and not had a single day in court. So it's all just trying to drain you legally. Joe. The fact alone that I'm speaking into this microphone is exactly what Marine Lynn doesn't want. I'm dangerous to the anti captivity or rather the captivity industry because I know a lot of things. Of course seaworld was if you want to use the term in bed with marine land, a seaworld likes to acquire because because in the states you can't acquire a wild caught animals at seaworld would do is they would get the animals that marine land would import. So marina would import wild cod belugas from Russia breed them, and because the calves were bred in captivity, they could now be moved to the states.

Speaker 3:          00:55:10       So this was how seaworld in the states was trying to continue to acquire these animals. So that's, and this is exactly what this bill is sort of trying to stop, so that's one of the things that sea world was full of shit about because seaworld was trying to say we haven't done like one of one of their commercials was saying that they haven't, they haven't caught in a whale in 35 years. Yeah. They haven't captured a whale from the wild in 35 years. There's a number of examples of that being bullshit. One being a wild orca or what they deemed rescued, orca named Morgan that was captured off the coast of the Netherlands who was, you know, it was by itself. It had left it's potter, it was, it had lost contact with his pod. And so it's a, it's a, a dolphinarium called Darfur, dolphinarium hi bike. They acquired this animal and then what they did or they took it and they called it rehabbing and then they, of course demon non releasable. They sent it to a place and it's outlined in a black blackfish. In fact because there's a, there's a large, uh, the documentary blackfish. There's a relationship between seaworld and, uh, a facility called in tenor reef. It's called Laurel parking. So what seaworld did was they had that animal Morgan, the wild Orca, transferred to, um, to Laurel Park and now

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       it's actually part enlisted as part of its collection. That's a wild caught animals. So seaworld was sit there and tell this idea that we haven't done this in years and yet they're, they're importing wild, wild caught animals that have just recently bred one the babies from Canada and then they're, they're basically adding to their, to their stock of animals. This other wild caught animals. So we can talk about the bullshit that seaworld spews all day. But the nice thing is most people are now conscious of it. Most people look at it and say, I mean every time seaworld tweets, anything, they get a lot of fucking hate because people know now they know they're essentially a slavery organization. Yeah. I can't disagree. And saying that we haven't captured a slave in 35 years, it's still disgusting. The idea that that's how that's okay, that they can just say, we haven't participated in slavery catching slaves in 35 years.

Speaker 4:          00:57:16       We just keep them here. Locked in a tiny little. Have you ever seen the map? I'm sure you have. The parking lot is in juxtaposition to the actual area where the dolphins give to swim. The most heartbreaking one is would that pool is right next to the ocean when you could see it physically right there. There's a lot of facilities with the dolphins or spy hopping and they can see the. See it's right there. The ocean is right there. It's a question of picking them up and throwing them back in there. Why can't they make it so that they can go back and forth? Why can't they make it so that they can have like set up a facility? This is the way you can make it. Some of these animals can transition back into the wild and that if they do decide to come and participate in show that they could do it on their own.

Speaker 4:          00:57:56       Free will have like an open area where it's connected to like a dock where the pools and the areas where the animals swim, they should be examined by some marine biologists. That demon ethical, this is an enormous place as long as you don't keep them in here, but they can do their stuff in here and everything will be fine and have it be actual ocean water and then have an open portal so you don't have to worry about them starving to death in a wild. They can always come in and get food anytime they want and that way you can kind of keep both things happening like they develop a relationship with these animals where it's a. it's an actual real relationship. It's not captivity. They come because they want to get food sorta like squirrels, the park or something. This is exactly what animal rights people if you will, and and scientists these days are advocating for.

Speaker 4:          00:58:42       They want seaside sanctuaries where which these animals remain in human care and are available for people to watch. Of course you're going to have to keep the stop. The breeding, the breeding has got to stop. Ultimately, you want to phrase this this out completely, unless they want to fuck on their own in front of everybody, I'm going to guess that people are, that the scientists going to try to stop that, but that's what people are advocating for really is the seaside sanctuaries. But seaworld keeps saying that, oh, there's so many pathogens in the water and it's going to make these animals to central. Again, it's all bullshit. You just mean. Well, it means they think that they're going to become susceptible and say, or that or that. The transition itself from captivity into this new environment is going to be too much to stomach. Well, where was that logic when they were plucking them out of the, out of the ocean and putting them in these concrete tanks?

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       Right? Well, they're going to have to adapt if, if they changed the laws and they make it so that, that's, um, that's just the only acceptable solution. Then they'll adapt. There wasn't any way. There was a law, uh, introduce a couple of years ago by his name was assemblyman Richard Bloom. And it was a bill that ultimately was going to retire all the orcas in San Diego to seaside sanctuaries. The issue that was raised is that there are no seaside sanctuaries yet. And so the bill ultimately died. Well, fucking seaworld use your money, bitch. What? Yeah. You have a giant facility. You obviously made money off of those things. What, how down are they right now? Yeah. Well their net worth or rather their, their company valuation when they did their initial IPO, initial public offering was uh, in and around $2,000,000,000. And basically that's down to one point.

Speaker 4:          01:00:13       It was down to one point five at one point seven. So, you know, animal activism, if you will, has really caused them a lot of harm financially. They've literally taken, I'm just aware that they're not, they're not. Well of course they're still worth a lot of money. But for a slave organization to be worth over a billion dollars, that's kind of fucked. And then you could buy stock in the slave organization. Yeah. What the fuck man, I watched that stock price daily. I mean, they're not recovering that man. Are they? Have they rebounded? Is that wasn't showing depending on where they're at today because of us. Well, look it, look at yesterday. Look, people don't like me. Fuck a reuben. I'm going to get a lot of that to pump your money in the seaworld, the others and investment. Yeah. Well it's not going to be around in 20 or 30 years, so you're right.

Speaker 4:          01:01:00       It's more, the more we do research into the language of these things to the more scientists. I mean they've been trying to, you know, John Lilly was trying to get them to speak human. He was trying to get them to speak human languages like way back in, I guess it was like the sixties. Yeah. And he even set up an experiment where a woman lived in sort of this bizarre home where there was water. She spent most of her time, like waist deep in water. Yeah. Which wasn't jagging off the dolphin. That was the problem. She checked off the Dolphin Dolphins get horny. And she was like, well, this is a distraction. Let me just check them off real quick. And, and everybody's like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. What the fuck did you just say? And that's really, we've come a long way since then because clearly that was just a question of the animal mimicking.

Speaker 4:          01:01:48       I mean, the idea that this animal's going to adopt the English language over and above. Yeah. But, but to be fair, the mimicry itself was pretty impressive, pretty impressive. And I've worked with dolphins and I never, I never actually tried to have the dolphin mimic my own sound, but with what I was watching that duck, I watched a documentary recently as well is uh, it was pretty impressive. It's pretty impressive. Very. But the idea that that was teaching or trying to bridge the communication was pretty. I mean, that's, that's out there. Well, it was all lily could come up with back then. At the time, first of all, he was on acid almost every day. I mean, lily was a fucking maniac.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       You take ketamine and he was the guy that invented the isolation tank, which is one of my favorite things in the world. I have yet to do it. I can't wait to though. I'm going to. How long you here for? I'm here till uh, I leave Friday morning. Like hell yeah. I love that. Will set it. Set you up with the end of the float lab. There's a new place in Pasadena and that just opened up the largest place in the world. Yeah. Very interesting. Yeah, we'll look it up. That's fantastic. Appreciate that. What part of town he's staying in while you're here? We're going to be in Venice beach. Oh, Jesus Christ. That's where the float lab is. Oh, how about that dude? That's perfect. That we're going to call them right after this. We'll set it up. I'm extending because crash is the best car.

Speaker 1:          01:02:58       I've heard that. He's been on the podcast before. He's a fucking maniac. I love him. And he kept the float business alive with innovation back when no one did. Um, I had a guy who was fixing my tank and um, you know, I had an old tank which is one of the original tanks and it was starting to deteriorate a little bit because I'd had it for awhile. And um, this guy told me, it was like, this is crazy guy in Venice. It's making these tanks. It's just, they're just so much better than anybody else's pods. Is it? Or like full square rooms? I mean get into it. It looks like a small meat locker. That's what it looks like. You open a door and you climb and he has a bunch of different models. You have some that you gotta gotta gotTa Kinda Bend over when you get in.

Speaker 1:          01:03:40       But mine is like seven feet tall and like nine feet long. It's huge. I've heard you say that you find it like incredibly therapeutic and just clear your mind, take you to places where you can think clearly. I could benefit from some of them. It's great for that. It's great physically for your body to. I'm like my back, like opens up and relax. I feel like I couldn't like pop. It just felt like stretching my, my, my shoulders up. It just goes pop, pop, pop. Because everything's just relaxing. It's a great source of magnesium because there's a thousand pounds of epsom salts in the water. My older one was like 800 pounds, but the bigger one requires more so it's a thousand pounds of salt and that epsom salt, when you're bodies floating in that your, your skin is absorbing the magnesium super healthy for you. He used to feel great.

Speaker 1:          01:04:23       You get out of there, you feel great and be going like I do trip your balls off in there. I went on mushrooms on New Year's Eve, took mushrooms, so I was cleaning my office and I'm like, look what I got here, do I do this? So I ate the mushrooms and then I didn't take a big dose, but I took enough where I started getting really weird. I waited about an hour until I couldn't take it anymore. I was like, I can't be around people anymore. I got to get in the tank. And then I got in the tank and the tank was good to you for bracing. Just to set me on a voyage. Just sent me an, a voyage through my mind and got me in this very positive groove. Do you really like it was, it was a good trip because it was, um, it was a new years eve trip.

Speaker 1:          01:05:06       It was like a, like New Year's Eve bullshit. Really the end of the day, who cares, you know, it's just another day, man. Like what? What is in your butt? Rituals as I'm getting older and more experienced, I used to reject anything that was established because of my life wasn't so good when I was growing up and I thought that everything that was everything that everybody wanted and everything there, but he's working for. It was all bullshit. Degrees are bullshit and rituals are bullshit and fuck you. I'm a rebel. I know I can appreciate that perspective should be told. But as I get older, I recognized the benefit in like a new beginning in your mind, like this year I am going to do this. This year I'm going to like how many people. It's hard for people to actually re tweeted something today from Neil Strauss who's a really brilliant guy and a, it's an article that he wrote about strategies and systems that you can set up to, uh, make sure you don't fall into the same traps and sabotage yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:06:02       Cycles. Yeah. Which a lot of people do, but you don't have to be the idea. There it is right there. Why you need a Ulyssa strategy for 2016, the eye people have this thing in their mind that this new, this new day in this new time is going to be the start of their new diet. They're going to quit smoking. They're gonna start exercising. They're going to get their life in order and they go at it with this, these ernest's intentions, but very few continue that process. And the problem being we are creatures of habit and we have these comfort zones and we've sort of set up and when you set up those comfort zones, you set up these established patterns. It's, it's very easy to fall right back into them. It's very easy to be lazy. But John Lilly that was studying like the different levels of consciousness that he himself said that there are these, these cycles that you have to try to make yourself conscious of and try to break these cycles and like, um, I know I myself find myself too often sitting in a bathtub feeling a pretty down on things and I'm like, you know, maybe if I get out of the fucking bathtub, go for a jog or so I wouldn't feel like this.

Speaker 1:          01:07:14       Right. It definitely would help. Going for a jog is one of the best piece of advice anybody could ever give you. Have you ever have something that's fucking with you? Just go for a run. Get those endorphins flowing and get that blood pumping and put things into perspective. Your mind starts to change immediately. You actually start the language that your, that your mind beats the shit out of you with changes and suddenly you start getting resolved and answers to your problems versus like dwelling on them. I, myself personally, I have gone for runs and I don't run that much but. And I ride my bike like in in the dark when I'm amidst the darker depths of hell. And every time I come back saying thank God you've went and did something right. Well, I think we associate as a human being. We associate dilemmas and physical problems like issues like bills or lawsuits.

Speaker 1:          01:08:01       In your case. All these, we associate those things with a physical thing because our bodies are used to any fear or danger from the time we were monkeys. It's always been a physical danger. There's never been like a social issue until recently. I mean the last few thousand years when human beings start talking to each other, the real problems that we had were all. They weren't fucking bills. It's more instinctual almost looks like there's a physical problem. So when you develop stress and anxiety, you have this physical response to that like Holy Shit, what's going on? And then you don't do anything with that physical response. That physical response never gets fed. He never run. You never exercise. He never exert. And so your body just gets into a deeper and deeper level of funk and stress and the physical exertion. All that seems like a meathead thing to say, look, you just got to go to the gym,

Speaker 3:          01:08:54       walk it off, but you really do. You really do. And if you do do that, you will feel better. Like some of my favorite people are people that do Jujitsu because judges

Speaker 1:          01:09:04       two is such a life and death struggle on a regular basis with people you love and care about. It's a bizarre thing, like, you know, when you roll with people that you love, like your friends with you slap hands and they tried to fucking kill each other and you're going to war. I mean, it's exhausting. So when it's over, you're drained. So other pole shit of regular bullshit to seems way less significant. You still have to deal with it. You're still a person who still live in the real world, still have taxes, still a problem,

Speaker 3:          01:09:32       still have lawsuits. Yeah. Your situation's very, very extreme. My situation is extreme. In fact, if you don't mind, I wouldn't mind a sort of offering a perspective of just how fucked things are. Yeah, please do. So shortly after I was on the podcast, and I don't know if you recall, you probably don't, you see a lot of tweets, but I tweeted you, um, video of the owner of marine land, who is the man that's suing myself and a number of other people to try to stifle our advocacy and essentially punish us. And the video was of him driving past our home and uh, you know, I upload it to Youtube and whatnot. And then shortly thereafter there were more videos and then neighbors started taking photos when I wasn't home. So he drives by and just threatened you may slows down. Well, I assume it's to intimidate my girlfriend and I, he has a history of doing this and I want to touch a little bit on that in a moment, but I just want to give my example to begin with.

Speaker 3:          01:10:24       Give this videos on youtube right now. Yeah, we see it. Sure. What's it, what's your channel? I wouldn't mind showing you a couple of them, just google John Holder j o h n h o l e r and you'll get videos. Footage. I mean there's a pretty elaborate history. We've unearthed a lot about sort of how he, how he operates. I'm getting a little nervous talking about this jewelry now because I just, I know the consequences of which are going to cost a lot of money and cause a lot of anxiety where I'm going with this story. But when is this fucking lawsuit get resolved here? Here's the video. We're going to watch the video real quick. So this is you looking out the curtain. So I live at the end of a dead end street and across from me as the water. It's a beautiful place. I love it and he's trying to take from me my home essentially.

Speaker 3:          01:11:03       But I saw him come by and he stopped in front of my house. I armed myself with my old blackberry camera. He went down the road and you see them now coming back. See speeds up and right here you'll see slows right down and he just wants intimidate. Of course he had no idea that I'm there. Of course I present myself and I'm just like, what you want bro? And then there he goes. So he drives off. When you come there, he drives off little pussy. Yeah, well that's the same push. You like to put a lot of bullets in a while. He'd shot those dogs if you don't recall my telling you a couple of dogs wandered off to his property. Boom. Filled him with a shotgun pellets. Anyways, so he pulled. Do you know that for sure that that's his truck? Absolutely. And in fact we've got them in this new vehicle as well as license plate.

Speaker 3:          01:11:45       The whole works. The police in fact set up a surveillance camera. Two of them, they caught him independently and, and don't quote me, but I'm going to call it 12 times. The police refused to lay any charges because they said a driving past someone's home isn't technically is criminal harassment. Despite the fact that we were like looked at the man suing us. He's, he's dangerous. I mean, I, I knew the man, at least historically, they've had a shotgun in his vehicle. He's got a lot of reason to not like my myself and my girlfriend who's on any given time alone in my home, so nonetheless the police wouldn't do anything. We took that information and went to a justice of the peace to try to lay what's called a private, a charge, not a charge, but we just want him a summons to come into the court and explain this behavior. This is normally a 30 day process. Marine lands lawyers managed to get in an appeal to the summons, which is largely unprecedented. I mean, I guess with, I guess people with money can skirt the law, but nonetheless it took a year and a half. The lawyer, the judge ultimately decided that this issue shouldn't be decided in the criminal court. In fact, it should be dealt within the civil matters. So he quashed the summons so the owner didn't have to come in and explain himself. And now I'm waiting any given day. Now because the lawyers in already informed my other lawyers, they're seeking a cost, a motion where I'm to pay the legal fees, which they're claiming upwards of $100,000

Speaker 3:          01:13:13       to have had to try to get this summons against him. His stocking leads to my trying to lay a private, a charge if you will, or whatever, private summons. He gets it quashed and now he wants to put me on the hook for his legal fees. So he's just trying to drain you financial. It's a war of attrition and it's like there's just trying to crush anyone that's showing any type of opposition. Now I know the last time you were on you have like a go fund me or something like that. People contributed to how do we, how do we help you? Wow, what is that address? And so recently I had to retain a new lawyer to have my lawyers have left and these were ultimately the ones that were working really at a cost. Effectively they're gone. So I had to retain a new lawyer.

Speaker 3:          01:13:58       I don't ask for a lot of money from people, but I do ask for a lot of people, as long as we've got money in our lawyers can work, this lawsuit has to run its course and at some point, and the judge has already said it's already criticized marine land for taking as long as they have now. Marina wants to say, well, this is the behavior of the people of the, of the defendants, the behavior being that we tried to seek some, some protection from this man that took a year and a half. He's trying. The lawyers are trying to allege that it's our behavior that delaying this process and yet here we are two years after I was here and not a single day later, of course, a significant legal fees, but we recently got a very generous contribution from some animal rights organizations that are running little fundraisers for us. Uh, we used to have what you would call a benefactor, which was sam simon. He's cocreator for the simpsons. He was giving us a lot of money. Unfortunately recently he passed away. So that's sorta ended. But yeah, largely it's the, it's the, it's the public support. This is really quite unprecedented to have a litigation, uh, funded by crowdfunding. It's really unheard of. It's an important.

Speaker 1:          01:15:02       So what is the address and how do people get. We're going to put the address on Youtube, so if you're listening to this on youtube, it will be in the description of the podcast and I'm also going to put it on twitter and uh, so we'll, we'll have it as available as possible. If we can put it in the itunes, a description of the podcast, we'll put it in that to what is, what is the address and how do people get to it?

Speaker 3:          01:15:25       Save smooshy Dotcom. Smooshy being the walrus that had the anomalous relationship with. So it's s a, v e s m o s h I. okay. Dot Com. So, so again, I'm not funding just my own lawsuit. I stuck my neck out and said I'm going to pay for all these lawsuits. Right. Because for some years ago, and I'd mentioned before that I won wipe out Canada. So there was a period where I actually had a good chunk of change in the bank. So when these lawsuits started to fly, I just started cutting checks, just start cutting checks. Blow. That didn't last very long. Right. So really it is the support of the people. But if you don't mind my touching a little more. Here's the, here's the page. Oh cool. So save smooshy. That saves smooshy.org. Go to go to the Dotcom one. Yeah. What's the difference? The differences. That was just a website that I had created for sort of like ongoing fundraising and not exist. Safe, smooth. No. Put it all together in one word. They're safe. Smooshy DOTCOM. It did. It didn't work. No. It should.

Speaker 1:          01:16:19       That motherfucker close down your website. Yeah. Oh, he's trying to shut down my twitter. Nevermind it. Is He. Okay. Here we go. Save smooshy.com. What is it? It had needed www dot. Well, it forwards to a gofund me. That's probably why it needed a ww. Um, defend animal abuse whistleblowers. So right now you've got some donations and there's a donate button. Donate on. You can share it on facebook and uh, let's, uh, let's fucking pump this up just to stress that that's in Canadian currency. Not to scare anyone because a lot of people go and just like, well, what's the seat next to the donation? You guys just stop using your bullshit money and use ours. Cut it out. It'd be nice. Yeah, that's for damn sure you're connected to us. Let's cut the shit. Goddammit. Mexico to cut the shit with your pesos. If I can just touch on

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       a story that I think it's important in the realm of public opinion to, or rather consciousness to know of, but this isn't the first time that the owner Marineland has stocked and intimidated people. In fact, uh, some years ago, uh, a woman named Paula Miller was living in a trailer park that the owner marina actually owned that was across the street from the park and he had promised them all that he was not going to, to, to move them or displace them and this was going to be their home for a long time. A lot of retirees there, people put some permanent investment in, in their properties while ultimately he did elect to kick everyone out. Uh, he had the city support, which is not, again, we're up against a lot of forces, if you will. Well, one woman was having none of that. She was, she was refusing to move and the owner would repeatedly drive by an intimidator. And ultimately what she did was she had written on the wall, she'd written John Holder made you get exactly what you deserve tenfold. And then she thereafter committed suicide. Yeah, I think it's important to tell that story. I, it's because, uh, it illuminates sort of who he is.

Speaker 1:          01:18:17       Yes. Essentially. Allegedly, of course, to say that, well, we're going to help you, man. We're to pump this fucker. I've said it before and I'll say it again, like, we're really still in this game because of you

Speaker 3:          01:18:29       heartfelt appreciation for having me back on. It's a can't tell you. And the timing is right because we have a bunch of different motion dates coming up and.

Speaker 1:          01:18:36       But I appreciate that, but I also appreciate what you're doing. I think that guys like you were super important for this. You, you in particular, you probably one of the most important because this whole thing that we're experiencing right now is essentially our civilization is awakening to the horrors of the past and we're doing something that's really fucked up and not right and we've been doing it for a long time, so we think it's okay because we've been doing it for a long time and this is sort of the same thing that they experienced with slavery. I mean, slavery had existed for a long fucking time and it took a bunch. I mean, people feel like you're exaggerating this. This is not slavery. These are animals. Nope. They're insanely intelligent animals. There are. They're so much different than a fucking puppy. There's so much different than a squirrel. They have a cerebral cortex that's 40 percent larger than human beings. We don't know why. We don't know what they're saying. We know they have an insanely complex language, but we don't know what it's. We don't know what the meaning behind the sounds are. We don't know. We've recognized dialects. They have different dialects in different areas. We know that they speak differently in different parts of the world, and I can,

Speaker 3:          01:19:47       I can personally offer perspective of having had a really strong relationship with an animal, like my anomalous relationship with smooshy, the Walrus, and I'll just do a quick, uh, summary of it is that she at one point believed that I was her mother. I mean, she still does. It's an eight now. She thinks that I'm her mother. It's tattooed on her brain, right? I've imprinted on her, uh, so I got to appreciate what it was like to raise this animal in that unique opportunity and in that the language. And I wish Jonsi lily would still be around because I think that he himself will be calling a lot of bullshit on what's going on. He'd say, this is a fucking catastrophe that during your, your what's being imposed on us, the separation, everything else. But I got to learn what it was like to teach an animal, to have a sense of humor.

Speaker 3:          01:20:27       For instance. I mean, this Walrus has a sense of humor. This walrus knows me intimately. Whether I raise my voice or I lower it, she has, she knows me in the, in a second dog. Now I'm going to say, I'm going to say for outside, this is an animal that could appreciate when there was real threat against me and we used to joke around that and the way that we discovered that she was so protective of me that people come really close to me. She would beat the snot out of these people. I mean she'd come into like a 200 pound bowling ball and displace you, but she knew when I was messing with someone or when someone had grabbed me and it appeared to be a little more violent. It was mean. Her reaction is someone grabs you in a violent way. The owner's son in fact.

Speaker 3:          01:21:02       And uh, yeah, the owner's son came over one time. He just didn't believe what was going on. And he grabbed me and he didn't grab me in a smooth and fun way. He grabbed me and shook me. Smooshy never forgot his face. A she'd fucking shoes. There was a gap between associate smashed up against those bars really aggressively harping on him, the yellow and everything else, and even in the weeks and months to come, every time he'd come any, any even remotely close to me are in the room. She was ready to pounce. It was amazing. How fast is a walrus pounds. They can you call it pouncing? I wouldn't call it that kind of waddle right there. Pretty fast. There are a heavy animal. Actually I can say that I've, I've, and not just myself, another other former trainers have actually rescued the owner of marine land from, uh, from Walter says that we're, that we're about to attack them.

Speaker 3:          01:21:45       There's a video on youtube, which is actually hilarious, where, uh, he's out on stage, obviously yelling at a trainer to bring out more animals. Everything in a Walrus, breaks from them and starts going towards the owner and he's turns around, starts booking and the walrus stops and he turns around and grabs his water and froze the water. And then the wall was, goes and he sort of tucks away behind this sort of safety door. And I'm just like, what a con. I couldn't wait for him to get knocked down, man. It didn't happen. Whatever. But there was a number of examples of that. Actually, there's another video, if you don't mind, um, look up. If you Google John Holder again, you can get to a place where he's actually a confronting a, an activist who's just, they're offering on public property, which has now since been leased to the two marine land by the city.

Speaker 3:          01:22:28       Um, he's handing leaflets with information while they have a, they have a conflict. They have sort of a coming together and uh, John Holder in plain English threatens to stab him and bury him. And of course, the activist, who's Mike Garrett, he's a fantastic guy. Uh, was um, was, you know, he's like, I'm assuming he saw us. He tried to keep, keep some sense and keep things as light as possible. But John just has a conniption. He's yell and his arms and up. I mean, John's a little guy, right? He's got what I call it, a little big man where he's just. But anyways, he goes all because the guy is protesting against what we use the word protesting, but more than anything he's handing information. He's handing a history of marine landed, but it happens to be at the end of the park on public property. But nonetheless, you know, uh, the city obliged and leased the land to them. I mean, it is what it is. Greenland's operated for 53 years. I'm above the law. There was no loss. There was nothing. Now there are some. Thankfully things are, are turning slowly. But if you could find that video, if not, that's all right Joe, while I've got a while, we're just here, I'd like to show you this. Oh yeah, let's, let's take a look. So here he's like, oh look, we're hugging. And then here

Speaker 3:          01:23:37       that little guys, the little guys, the owner, and that's his hired gun on the uh,

Speaker 5:          01:23:41       right. They're all it is, is information. That's all public property. All we doing is asking. People don't have to take it. Whale, whale and Nadia. It's called me a whale earlier. Let's stick with the program. I can see John getting a little furious here. Thankfully. Thank God John doesn't have a knife. You all see very me right here as you said. When did he say that though?

Speaker 3:          01:24:13       You said it earlier in the video. Oh, let me hear the beginning where you said him.

Speaker 5:          01:24:19       This is the closest I've ever been in my life. Like literally I come on, he's just doing his job. You're lucky. I know. I'm lucky you don't have a knife so you would stab me if you had a knife. Oh, you kill me right here. You would bury me right here. You wouldn't even bother to look into mass graves. Come on up folks. It's just information. That's all it is. Just information. John doesn't want to stab me and

Speaker 3:          01:24:47       great guy. Mike's a great guy. I've tried to support him as well. He's being sued. Of course. He's actually having his wages garnished because marine land, what they do is they use these lawsuits and then they propose all these different motions, so it's sort of a function inside the lawsuit. Well, what happens is during these motions is it can go either way, right? A lawyer can, can win a motion against another lawyer, whether it be a bullshit lawsuit or not, but what happens is in that process it becomes a cost award. So unfortunate for Mike, he got a cost order against him and he couldn't afford whatever the price was. Of course, Marineland we'll say an inflated price prices. All this costs $25,000 to have to bring him in here. And so the judge awarded $10,000. So Mike's happens, his wages garnished. Now this is not a man who broke the law.

Speaker 3:          01:25:27       This is a man who opposed, uh, the policies and the, and the practices of marine land. This is because of this right here. Because of that, right there. So he's having his wages garnished to the tune of how much, I think he said 30 percent a month for how long or how much per paycheck? He still knows quite a bit of money. How much does he think he owes in the arrange of six or 7,000 at this point. And he just lost his lawyer. We, we actually had the similar lawyers. He's, he's looking for a lawyer. So this is a public plea, if there are any lawyers in Canada, they're looking to make a name for themselves and help our ourselves or Mike Garrett like, yes, please get involved. And if you do help, I'll tweet it out. If you do help, I'll put it up online and I'll. People know that you're doing

Speaker 4:          01:26:03       a good thing. Joe, while you're here, I just want you to take a look at this print we've had made. This is from a, a. it's just an absolute sick graffiti artists named Walk Brooklyn. Save smooshy marine land. Does that, that teacher and this teacher that I'm giving to me. So I'll hold it up. Yeah. This is a courtesy. Lofty Towers is a place in Niagara Falls that, that, uh, generously printed it for us. And then of course, each one you've got to see this guy's work. It's fantastic. And it's basically, if you look at it, you've got the wall, you've got the Walrus. Smooshy is basically giving the finger to what appears to be an old man who's with a shirt that says, bury me with my money, who's got some shackles around it? And it says, it sort of looks like it says fuck marine land on the bottom.

Speaker 4:          01:26:43       I don't know if it actually does, but um, so that's the old dude supposedly. I don't think. I Dunno. I have no idea. Listen, look like I'm good. Totally not him. No, not. Can't possibly be halfly. Not Slave, but there's a nice shirt for you to wear it when you're doing some gardening or raising your chickens in the back, then I'll use that for sure. It's much. It's. I hate hearing stories like that. I hate hearing. I hate hearing what's ultimately human failure. That's like a civilization failure, societal, cultural failure. This, this old creepy fuck that's getting away with. I mean, you could just tell them that video is disgusting and this whole thing is disgusting. Guy Wants to continue his slave business and he's, he's out there themselves getting his own fucking hands dirty. It's worth more money than I can even conceive. And yet all he wants is the power we hold to like if I was worth that much money.

Speaker 4:          01:27:38       Does he have a wife? He has a wonderful wife, in fact. Yes. Wonderful. Yeah, she's a, she's a, she's a very nice going to say if I, if I didn't Costa Rica about hookers and coke until the heart stops. He likes the hunt. You'd think he'd just be able to hunt steady, like just go do the thing that you liked the most, but what he likes the most, what appears to be is to be a tire. You know, I watched that episode of you and Lance Armstrong and I thought it was really great. It really humanize the situation he was in. But the thing, the thing that he expressed the most, uh, the regret was when he ultimately was a, was a, I forget the word he used, but like get throwing all these lawsuits against. Yeah, he fucked up. He fucked up that, that was a fuck up.

Speaker 4:          01:28:16       But that was, that would be 100 percent supportive. Um, that's the, I mean cause you know, it's like if you ever seen the bill burr bit where he's on Conan or we talked about it until it happens. But I am learning about bill burr now. Actually. I find his comedy amazing. It's one of the best ever that do show that he's got half is so great. I watched an episode the other night was really good. It's on Netflix folks. If you want to watch it. It's an animated series called F is for family and he's just a great guy. He's just, he's the real deal. Bill Burr is the real deal. He's just one of the best guys ever. And um, he had this amazing bit about Lance Armstrong being that like, you know, basically his, his words are psychopath beat. You're a psychopath, like the whole fucking sports on steroids.

Speaker 4:          01:28:57       They're all on drugs. And it's true. He became the face. Unfortunately he was pegged being the guy and I mean he had all the accolades. He had the image. So it. And which also means you had the most to lose. But the thing that he expressed most was he regretted on people's lives. I mean, he was trying to keep this whole thing going. This guy, what he's doing is just normal. It's what people do. You know, when power, when people have established power, they try to protect it. He recognizes all the benefits that he's had for that power and he doesn't want to step down and relinquish it. And also if he did, he would have to somehow or another admit that what he was doing was wrong. And I assumed that marine land is still making money. Uh, it still makes some money out a little bit, is it?

Speaker 4:          01:29:38       The balance is down significantly because tourism is up in Niagara Falls. But I think if you guys really want to get a, a, a good perspective. There was a podcast that I was recently on called Canada land and it's a, it's a big podcast hosted by an investigative journalist, a Jesse Brown, and he's very meticulous and very thorough in his, uh, in his work. And he had, and he detailed this exchange between he and marine marketing. No one put a name on it. It's got to be marine lines. Lawyers, I don't know. But nonetheless, if you want to see how they operate and how far they're willing to go to suppress what I say and the information that we provide, do go to the candle and podcasts and check it out. Um, they've threatened to sue him, they vowed to suit to what they called judgment, and that's a quote.

Speaker 4:          01:30:20       Um, but that's just the way they operate. If you, I mean, you yourself, Joe, and I hate to say it, but it would be a dream if they threatened to sue you. It's not going to happen, but why would they sue me? First of all, I'm a fucking American. You can't sue me. The goofy kangaroo court. He's a Dick. He's suing Americans right now. I'm trying to threaten them with that and I'll drive by his house at Fuck, how about that? I'll just say nice things to him. I want him to threaten him. Yeah. That Canada land podcast details at all. It was well, it was really well done. I just think the whole thing eventually, when you look at it historically, I think, um, my friend Amber Lyon had a great quote when she was talking about when she used to work for CNN. Um, it's, I love this quote.

Speaker 4:          01:31:06       It's being on the wrong side of history. Yeah, exactly. And that's what this guy is. He's on the wrong side of history. Yet, when it all boils down, you're going to look like an ugly monster. Yeah. I don't know what he's trying to. What type of legacy is trying to protect at this point in? The funny thing is all of these make it lawyers rich. It's not making me broke. It's not working. I mean, to a certain extent that doing old rich fucks. Do they sue you? You know? I mean, that's common practice they have. That's their avenue of getting back at you for talking. He exists in a different world. He is an old man and he's born in a world where there was no internet and he's experiencing the ramifications of this time that we're in and also the new information that exists now where we understand that these practices they've been engaging in for decades are cruel and inhumane and disgusting. They're disgusting. There's no other way to say it. Yeah. Captivity of

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       mammals like that. It's fucking disgust. I indeed. Where's it going to go, man? Like what? How long can this guy keep dragging you around the courts? Well, unfortunately there was some changes to the law societies laws and where it used to be, I believe three years of inactivity and the lawsuit you can, you can file a motion to have it thrown out. That's been extended as I think it was march of last year to five years, so we've got a lot of things going against us. So you have two more years of inactivity before they could sue you. I, I mean, I don't know. I'm not a lawyer, but this is my understanding of what was an opportunity before that is no longer there, but the idea is at some point he, he himself has to play by the rules of the courts. He's going to have to be examined.

Speaker 3:          01:32:43       He's the one that's got the information that we want. We want to go get that information. This is information that marine land is steadfast right now and isolating or other insulating any type of, of, uh, of, of witnesses. I mean he himself as a witness to all of the things that he's alleging against that he should be the one that is responding to the lawsuit instead. They give us this, uh, this, uh, this glorified janitor. Well, what the fuck does this janitor have to do with our lawsuit? We want to look at your financial files. You're claiming financial losses, uh, in, uh, in, in the region of what's the janitor? What are you talking about? So what marine land doesn't listen. This shouldn't surprise anyone is rather than be like, okay, look, I'm suing you so you can take a look at my files. I'm going to present to you that the net losses, financial losses of that I'm claiming, and then you're going to have to defend against this information.

Speaker 3:          01:33:25       Well, instead they, they gave me this, this janitor. Well, what the hell, what the hell has that got to do with anything we don't want to, we don't want it gave you a janitor for what? Like to look through his that he's gonna. Give us the files apparently that we're looking at. That is going to give context to the lawsuit. It's nonsense Joe. It's just another means that I have to fight and spend a lot of money to try to get to the, to, to the root of it all, which is the legitimacy of the lawsuit, which there is none. I'm being sued for plotting to steal a walrus. That's what it's all about. My last wanting to steal smooshy my lawsuit is plotting to steal smooshy. My girlfriend's lawsuit is defamation in the sense that she expressed concern for the lone remaining killer whale Kiska, which was bleeding profusely from her tail and hurt her or talk with the, with the Toronto Sun or rather the Toronto Star, which is the newspaper that revealed all the, sort of did the investigation of marine land.

Speaker 3:          01:34:16       So she's being sued and they had a video and then the video, you see the killer whale bleeding like crazy. I don't know how you can call that defamation. And then there's another lawsuit called, uh, that's a, that's going against Jim Hammond. He's a former land animal care supervisor and he's the one that witnessed John holders shoot the dogs on his property for no reason. I mean, that can't be defended. It's indefensible. These were, these were golden labs. These are puppy dogs and coyotes and these were his neighbors and the neighbors were afraid to press charges because they thought that John would sue them. They probably thought, right. I mean the police themselves said to me, we can't lay this charge on him because he's going to lawyer us. He's gonna. He's gonna lawyer up. Oh God. Yeah. It's really a stone wall. They're putting up, so he just gets is just strategy.

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       He just sues a war of attrition. He's got a suit. Everyone and what? I don't understand how the courts are allowing him to sue for this. This doesn't make any sense because it. Because we've gotten nowhere in terms of trying to prove the legitimacy of it. It's just the process itself in and of itself is, is, is punishing to people like me. So his idea is not, let's go to court. It's let's put him through the ringer so that he goes broke and ultimately the only way I can get out of this lawsuit was if I signed something, say I'm not going to talk anymore. Well fuck that. I'm not going to not talk, I'm going to continue to talk to talk. I'm going to continue to get my ass on these podcasts and spread my word and I get a louder and louder voice.

Speaker 3:          01:35:34       I mean that's my. That's my resolve. So you think ultimately this has to somehow or another come to a trial? It absolutely has to. Or he has to drop the charges and then he would have to get him. I am suing him. He's yet to respond to it. This is something again that normally lawsuits have 30 days. This has been three years and they've not responded well, how's that work? That how come you have to respond? But he doesn't have to respond. They've. What they've done is essentially, or what I believe they've done allegedly is they've hijacked the process is what it's called, where you just inundate the courts with a bunch of different things and every time a court date seems to come up, it gets adjourned or we do. In fact, I mean recently I lost my lawyer. He's moved away so I was having to find another one.

Speaker 3:          01:36:15       Marina and pounced immediately called for a motion. All of a sudden, okay, so now I'm defending or rather it happened to my girlfriend and she got a had to go in, but my court date ultimately did get a journal because my girlfriend was successful and actually having the motion to adjourn despite the fact that they're continuing with these motions. It's hard to explain. I'm not a lawyer. I can't really get down to the nitty gritty of it all. I can only just offer you the perspective of someone who's being punished unjustly with, with a, with a process that just in an is inherently a abusive. It's an abuse of process. It's really discouraging it. Welcome to my world, man, and I'm still trying to put food on the table. I mean actually got a life to try to live. I mean here I was 30, 35 when when this thing happened, I'm 38 years old.

Speaker 3:          01:36:59       I'm going to sweat so I get to look forward to resetting my life and try to pursue some personal endeavors. At what 45 is that? When is that? When I finally get to be freed of this thing, I mean I'm an activist. Yes. Okay. Call me an activist, but you know, when this is all said and done, I'm also a human being that wants to do stuff in life. What are you doing for work these days? Um, I do some. Uh, actually recently I was a pallbearer for hire. That was interesting. A lot of people don't have families, so I'd get a call and say, you want to come help carry this casket? Christ carrying dead that, that'd be great for the book. That's another thing. That's the problem in the book. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. That's a problem. Well, it's a problem because getting a publisher's tough right now. I mean, if you're going to publish my words, you're going to be sued. You know? I assume there was a documentary that was in its initial stages. It is gone. There was a big story in outside magazine that was coming out. This was, this was the feature piece. It got quashed. A lot of people show fear when it comes to lawsuits. Thankfully Ontario passed what's called

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       anti slap legislation. We got the thing, and I'd mentioned this in the earlier podcast, we were getting anti slap legislation. The problem is, and there's a major conflict of interest, is that Ontario's premier, she herself had a slap suit against one of the, uh, uh, mpps during the elections. She launched the lawsuit so that they couldn't talk about this controversial issue which was this gas plant scandal. And so what she did when she reintroduced the bill is that she took out the retro clause. This was our home run dude. We were out, not only that, marina was going to be up against a major punitive damages, like as per the letter of the law, they took out it being retro. It's no longer retroactive. It doesn't apply to us. It's insanity because this one woman, while she's the premier of Ontario, fuck her, I can't say that.

Speaker 4:          01:38:39       That's not going to help me. What's her name and appreciated Kathleen Wynne. Fuck you, Kathleen, dare you. I dare you remember I didn't say that. How dare you felt if I didn't say it? God Damn it. It's cruel, man. That what I've come to learn and involving yourself in any type of government process and everything else is that it's a thankless work. It's fucking brutal and it rarely to ever actually goes your way. I swear to you, I've had an arrow striking the bull's eye and every time it just glances every fucking time, but I'm not discouraged. Look, I'm on this fucking show, man. It's a dream come true. It happened again. I cannot fuck a believer, so a good things to come. I just gotTa keep focused. Good things to come. It's just so bizarre that no one from the government recognizes what a horrible thing this is not just in terms of the injustice that is being done, but also in terms of the pr for their legal system.

Speaker 4:          01:39:29       It is recognized. It's large. It's been expressed in a at Queen's Park and provincial legislation. These are abusive lawsuits and like we had a, an MPP standup, Sherry Denovo and she's just like, when is this gonna stop? I mean she's pounding her fist and everything else and what happens one? Unfortunately she's. It was a political issue and she's not a member of the Liberal Party. She's part of the New Democratic Party and that's the. That's a, you guys have a liberal party. We have various. We have a liberal party that's in power across, on both the federal and provincial legislation. Your king is a liberal, right? King the King Justin Trudeau. Yeah. I like that guy. He's the one that's going to legalize marijuana in Canada. Who seems like a cool guy. I've heard. I've seen him talk. I'm like, I wish we had a candidate for the United States president like that.

Speaker 4:          01:40:12       He's the one who were trying to get attention to see if we can't get support for this. Uh, for this bill. We're getting the Benne, the whales and dolphin captivity. He definitely should be a part of that and he definitely should step in and do something about what's happening with you. Have you guys tried to contact him about that? Uh, I've not, but that's it. This is something that's governed with by Ontario provincial. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So he, there's nothing he could do about that, but he's the king. He's the king. Yeah, that's right. Heavy is the crown. Yeah. What the fuck. You can't just step in. You'd think you'd tap on the shoulder. Now granted, uh, uh, I remember touring a lot of public figures and intern during my time at Marineland, including John [inaudible] who was a former prime minister's son who still goes there.

Speaker 4:          01:40:52       So there's still some government ties to marina. Of course. I'm still goes there like he visits. He brings some people to Scuba dive with the, uh, with the Beluga whales, people, people with disadvantages physically and stuff. It's, it's a great program. But uh, that I know of. He was continuing going up until 2012 at least. I don't know that he still goes, I haven't been in the park in that long. It just seems like Canada has so many great things going for it. And when I hear lawsuits like this and that are so insane, that lasts for so long. And then that your counter lawsuit doesn't get any traction at all and that no one's paying attention to it. I just don't understand how they can allow that to happen. That's a good thing. There's a lot of people helping us, right? I mean, because it appears that it's going to be the will of the people versus the government.

Speaker 4:          01:41:38       Yeah. Fuck man, I don't discourage me man. I know that. I know how I'm. I hold. I might hold deep and Shit, man. I know. It's just, uh, it's so frustrating. It's so frustrating as an observer, as an outsider looking at this and saying, man, this is just so strange. It's so strange that in this day and age this can happen. Then someone can get away with this. He hasn't gotten away with it yet. I ain't done. But he's getting away with what he's doing so far. So where, I mean literally the government should shut him the fuck down. They should have stopped this lawsuit. They should have been forced to your lawsuit against him. They should arrest him for stocking the whole deal. The whole deal. It's just, it's all disgusting. I've become quite jaded and admittedly I believed even when we came out that there would be some type of justice.

Speaker 4:          01:42:23       I mean, that's what we seeking. Of course, right. Isn't doing this for shits and giggles. Money is draining that justice. When you speak to power, you can expect some serious consequences. It's a simple as that, but it's so insane that the charge is attempting to kidnap a Walrus. Correct and trespassing. And here's the challenge, and I offer this to all your millions of viewers and listeners. You find a single video of the last day. I can't remember. Shit, I think it was April, I think. I believe it was a. oh shit. Why do I not know the date of this? Let's, uh, let's call it October 17th, I believe. Two thousand 12 marina alleges that I broke into the park with these legions of animal rights activists, which, which actually did happen. Not I wasn't there. I was on public property. I did not go into the park, but you know, hundreds did actually storm the gates.

Speaker 4:          01:43:07       And what marine line alleges that I trespassed in there and there's tons of videos. I mean you can get 15 different vantage points. If any single person finds me in that video, I will personally cut you a check for one point $5 million dollars. That doesn't get you to have one point $5,000,000. How would you offer one point $5,000,000? I'll blow you auntie. Well, it's not going to happen. Right? So it was guy about it. There's no video. They're going to photoshop you and then just for a blowjob, I was going to someone to use that CGI shit they did with Avatar. I think I can negotiate my way out of it. I'll get one point five my hand job marilla and thinks they're getting point five out of me. That's what they want. One point $5 million out of the other guy who essentially is, but put it this way, but they're trying to sue you for one point $5,000,000.

Speaker 4:          01:43:47       Yeah. That's the damage that they're claiming. What's that in real money in terms of like outside of Canada, like America where accounts. Oh, let's call it a million bones. That's a million bones. Your money's worth more, isn't it? Right now? Or significantly less. What? I'm drinking three beers. I can while I'm here. Well, we'll send you some things. I don't think it's legal. You send beer across the border. Probably not. It's probably a drug is a drug. Well, we'll see what Justin Trudeau can do about man. So, um, have you gotten any traction on any other shows? Like any, uh, anybody else reached out to you? That Katelyn podcast was timely and big and it was great. They get a lot of downloads and it's still going. It was published two weeks ago. Okay. So is Canada land, is what it's called? Yeah. And do you know what episode it is?

Speaker 4:          01:44:33       It's called Marineland. Okay. Everyone loves Murraylands most recent, uh, send people to that. What about a American podcasts of people? I'm Abby Martin, thankfully has had me on a couple of number of times and through the show I've, I've received quite a bit of support from like what I would call some real bad ass. Awesome people. So I'm, I'm most appreciative. But beyond that, no, there's, there's really quite a bit of fear of, of, of my speaking. So there are mostly in Canada, right? Uh, mostly in Canada, in America, outside magazine, they quashed that story. I mean, there's gonna be a big feature. How did that happen? Do you know? So, yeah, so the, uh, the writer was staying at our place and at the time, uh, I believe we had a, there were, um, there were people watching us and I had specifically said because his, his rental vehicle was parked across and here he was sitting on the couch and, you know, we're talking and talking and I looked and it was a truck that repeatedly drove by and stopped and went to the other industry, turned around.

Speaker 4:          01:45:27       I said, fuck, you're being, you're being watched. Like, and he's just like, you know, I think at this point he didn't truly appreciate the depths that we were in and at this point I don't, we weren't even sued yet. And uh, sure shit, marina named him by name the author and uh, and that was it. So he, he, he wouldn't, I mean, he, he tried to get the, the, the, the article to run, but outside ultimately said, we're not interested in being sued now it's a different time. There's anti slap legislation now, so outside if you're listening, but well, why didn't they just shut their fucking mouth until they published it? A he was. How did they find out what he was looking? He was asking a current and former employees to see if anyone would speak and then obviously there was someone that went to, you know when you live, when you worked in an oppressive sort of regime, if you will, you're quick to try to score bonus points.

Speaker 4:          01:46:15       I assume the former trainer or someone probably said, hey, this guy's calling around looking for something. What other businesses that guy have? They're all in house businesses, but yeah, he's got. He owns a lot of property. He does. He owes no one any money. There's no outside a financial interest whatsoever. He is the sole controlling mind. It seems like God like that needs to come to Jesus moment. We're just realized. It was like, what am I doing? My life is. I mean he's at the later stages of his life and just living like this. So when people talk anger and evil, and I hate to mention it, but a couple of years ago, a few years ago, and this was my greatest ally, his son actually passed away and this was the guy who actually allowed into the park when I went unbenounced to me, I was no longer allowed there.

Speaker 4:          01:46:52       He let me in and that's when I saw, you know, smooshy in the condition that she was in that ultimately inspired me to sort of speak out and not be anonymous. And uh, he shortly thereafter actually passed away and he was my age. How did he die? I had, I'm afraid to say, but I'll say that it was, I would, I believe it was avoidable. I think that when you live under an oppressive and difficult situation, especially with regards to your relationship with your father, that maybe you resort to methods to, to ease that pain maybe so to, to sort of a, I don't know, maybe forget your woes. So something drug related. I don't know. You don't know. Okay. Okay. I understand what you don't get. Cheers. Cool. Thanks. So I'm. So what's the next step? Like what happens now, other than the next step, tell everybody to go to save smooshy.com.

Speaker 4:          01:47:45       Throw some money around. The next step would be nice if maybe Peta would step up. I mean in terms of hypocrisy. Peter likes to use our headlines and to raise money for themselves on their websites and they'll donate here. Look, how do you say Murraylands animals donate here. We have not received an iota of help. In fact, I asked them, look, can you, can I just get a tweet out of you guys? And they said, Oh, it's a nonprofit. We've learned that. That doesn't help. Wait a minute, hold on. So they say donate here to them to help you and the money to them to help them. They know they don't. They don't ever say to help to help you. It's just that they use that stories. They'll be like, oh, mass graves found out marine land and then you know, there's the article and it's whole.

Speaker 4:          01:48:20       It's horrifying. Filled the says donate here and the donate. Donate, donate. Here's the donate to Peta. Yeah, it's tough man. Well, they're too busy killing cats and dogs. And tweeting you on Orca Day tweeting Joe Rogan, the guy who's, who's throwing arrows into every animal that, and they're asking you for retweets. I thought, I actually thought that was brilliant. I'm like, wow. Pete is like, really? Uh, they're, they're showing their true colors, but well, they know that I do love orcas. Yeah, fair enough. Just love to eat deer, right? Fair enough. I don't throw ours into everything. Not only edible stuff, but I mean, they, they've, they've retweeted things that I've posted up about, um, about orcas and particularly about my, my low thing of orchid captivity. And I think there's new laws had been passed in California, right? So recently seaworld. So what happened with seaworld, they had to ask permission from the California Coastal Commission for a $100,000,000 expansion of their pools of the existing pools.

Speaker 4:          01:49:23       What they've said is, we're going to eliminate the show, which is not true. That's not true in any capacity. What they're going to do is create a new environment. The larger one, which is good, but they're still going to have a presentation of sorts. It's going to rely on, you know, animals performing more natural behaviors, but still is going to be food deprivation in the train and it's going to be, you know, it's the same thing. It's just, it's presented differently. So what the, what the California coastal commission said was, look, we'll, we'll grant you permission to make this large expanse, but you can't breed a orcas anymore. So what seaworld basically said was, okay, well a, they've, they've considered not doing it altogether be now they're suing the California coastal commission alleging that they've, they've overstepped their boundaries, but what's really. So they want to keep breeding them.

Speaker 4:          01:50:07       Exactly. Doesn't that tell you everything? They're all of a sudden they're not gonna going to create this large habitat for the existing animals that they supposedly care so much for. But if there's that clause for breeding, not they're not going to do it. I mean that says it all. Really? It does. Wow. So they're not going to create the new, larger environment just because they're not allowed to breed them because they've got this clause. Well, they're going to sue, I assume, to try to have that overturned where, which I hope the California coastal commission would reconsider their, uh, their approval of. They should step it up and just make the whole fucking thing illegal. Jerry Brown, come on. Jerry Brown, you're a hippie. There is a, there is a recently tabled bill, which is a federal ban across the states for a Orca captivity. They should, they should.

Speaker 4:          01:50:44       One hundred percent. I mean that. I wish there was a way that they could hook up a fucking machine to a pond or a pool or an Orca is and have that orchid communicate and have it broken down to English. Now we have google translate for Russian and Spanish. How about an orchid translate? If they've, if they figured out a way to scientifically without debate, analyze the sounds and break them down into an English language that we could, could read and understand that people would be mortified. Oh my God, what if work has just started saying really racist shit. Just hate Chinese people. Well, they have reasonably well. Maybe not the Orcas, dolphins and whatnot have reason to hate the people of Japan who are just repeatedly a hacking them up. And then of course in the Faroe Islands where, and I watched the video of our documentary on what's called the grinned is when they, uh, they, they, they do these drive fisheries, what they do, they drive the animals, their sonic animals, so you know, pound the bottom of the ocean floor or these metal rods into other steel structures.

Speaker 4:          01:51:45       And then the herds, the animals onto the land. Well, what they do here in the Faroe Islands is they grabbed these hooks and they embed it in the fucking blow hole of the, uh, of the pilot whales for instance. And there's a long rope and then the people drag these things up and then they go up and then hack their throat, right? They want to call it substitute subsistence hunting. But it's hard to call that subsistence hunting. Maybe historically it has been, but it's pretty brutal. So they eat the pilot whales, is that what it is? They eat the pilot whales. Yeah. But if I, I'm, I'm of the opinion that it's, it's a, it's a cultural thing and they're on the wrong side of history. Now you've done it. It's done. It's documented. You've got the photos, if you will. The history's there. Let it be there.

Speaker 4:          01:52:24       Keep it in the history books. Well, it's one of those things where if you look at the environments where they eat whales, they, there's people starving. There's desperation in those places. I'm not going to argue in subsistence. Eating and hunting is important. I don't doubt that. But in the Faroe Islands across from where they're doing the grind is a law is a vast, beautiful cityscape. Like you can't tell me, you can't just go grab a couple eggs and a cellphone omelet. I don't know what you're saying. The Dolphin thing in the movie the cove, which is what you talked about about Japan, they, um, they tried. They were killing them because they were eating the tuner, right? Isn't that the idea behind it? They will use anything to defend the culture of killing these dolphins. But really it's fueled by the captivity industry. Those dolphins are invaluable.

Speaker 4:          01:53:09       And, and places like, and I'm not gonna say seaworld now because it's been a number of years, but they have, they have historically acquired animals from these drive fisheries, but they buy these animals and these hunters are driving around in fucking porsches and shit. It's not because they're, they're chopping these dolphins up for meat. That's not, that's not the, that's not the thriving industry. It's the captivity industry. They're selling them when they're killing all those. Why would they kill them if they could sell them? Well? Well, because they're not aesthetically pleasing. They take, they take so many of the animals, they take the more aesthetically pleasing. What do they sell them for? The, you know, the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars when they chop up the dolphins. And then they, uh, they, they, they, whenever, I guess they gave him the supermarkets and whatnot, but to give him the supermarkets are, softens.

Speaker 4:          01:53:47       Yeah. I've never been, I've been in Japan and every dolphins, but in Japan, the dolphin they have. I think that that's something that's going away. I think the, the, the new sort of generations of kids. I didn't watch the cove because I didn't want to see it because I've seen enough youtube videos of it. It's just, it's horrific. I can't watch burger. I didn't know that they ate them. Yeah. Well, and what we're coming to learn is that there's a high levels of mercury and this in the dolphin meat, so they're actually, it's actually poisoning people so that people are really getting away from that, but more than not, I think it's front to keep the captivity industry going and to keep that money there because they sell them to places in China. They sell them the places in wherever, in in Japan itself, and there's a lot of money that's being exchanged between the facilities and the and the hunters.

Speaker 4:          01:54:31       So outside of Canada and the United States, there's a bunch of places in the world that still have those sort of marine type shows. China, especially right now, China is really starting to, is like a burgeoning environment for the captivity into. So they're ramping it up. They're there. They're plucking elephants out of, uh, out of Thailand and stuff. I mean, I mean wild caught wild barn baby elephants. They're stripping them from their and from their mothers and their shipping them to these places in China. Now the zoos. I mean this is another thing that has to stop now. Right? Trying. Damn that dog festivals rough. Yeah. The Yulin dog festival. I watched that the other day on TV. There was some sort of a special. This woman goes over there and it was interesting though, the way the Chinese people looked at it, you know, and it's hard to argue, you know, they're looking at the same way we look at Bacon.

Speaker 4:          01:55:22       It offers great perspective for the people that are, for instance, saying, I will never fucking eat this dog. Well guess what, it's not any different. It's no less a conscious being then your pigs who are arguably significantly more intelligent than, uh, than dogs or your cows or your whatever it is what it is. But it does offer a glimpse into the hypocrisy of loving one animal and eating the neck. So I appreciate this thing. Offers that context. It's bizarre how we have these ideas, these hierarchies of animals were this one. It's okay to kill an Itam. This one that's not. It seems more novelty based. Really? Yeah, because I mean, you can make a hell of a hell of a pet out of a pig, but it's less cute. Well, there was a guy who had a pig the other day. Where the fuck were we?

Speaker 4:          01:56:03       Um, somewhere here in California. Guy had a pig on a leash. Awesome. Yeah. Well the dog is a dog and a pig and he had the pig on a leash like, well, okay. I don't quote me, but the intelligence of a pig is, from what I believe, I remember they're very smart. Ten year old or something human like my kid because it's so much smarter than the human mind fucking kid. No, there's supposed to be intelligent. I don't know if there were like a 10 year old, but they're supposed to be quite intelligent. It's hard to. It's hard to quantify, you know, like octopus. They're just starting to realize how intelligent octopus. Of course I eat the fuck out. Was anxious. Tuna, tuna, tuna or intelligent apparently. Brilliant. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Well to some, I guess wasn't smart enough to stay out of the cans. Cans of tuna room soon.

Speaker 4:          01:56:49       Sure, sure, sure. Are fucking. The ocean's fisheries are decimated. I think we've got basically an expiry date of uh, I think they said 2014. I watched a documentary called end of the line recently and they basically said that 90 percent of the ocean's fisheries are fucking gone in tune especially is really susceptible to extinction. And that's just because we just overfish over fish and the, it's the methods that we do it. And I mean you get these trout, you've got these trawlers that are, that are setting up nets to the size of football fields and they're just grinding the, the ocean floor and it's just decimating the ocean. Yeah. It ruins the bed, the ecology as a whole. It fucks up coral reefs. Everything. And what? What can be done about that? I mean they've got to leave it alone and let these things grow back.

Speaker 4:          01:57:32       It all comes down to what you can do with your wallet if you don't, if you're not spending the money to go to a, you know, a Nobu and get that, uh, that, that piece of Tofu or rather that whole shit, that piece of tuna, then, uh, then you assume that in some way, shape or form that that's gonna, that's gonna curb this behavior. But there's got to be. The problem is also that the ocean is not like, like if you're in a country in the country establishes like bag limits on animals, they can keep the populations very healthy. Precisely do that with an ocean is governing the oceans very aggressively. Well, if they were this whole thing in China or Japan wouldn't be taking place with the dolphins. You want people that are doing it is sea shepherd and unfortunately a Paul Watson is considered a terrorist and a lot of countries and can actually set foot on, on sound, on, on firm land, right? Some countries funny. He's the one that's being like a demonized for, for really trying to save the fucking planet. Well, the one of the things they've done in Japan where they've sort of skirted around this whale killing thing is they say that they're doing it for scientific research, but then they take these animals on board and

Speaker 1:          01:58:41       they butcher them and they sell the meat, but it's so fucked up. All they have to do is like pretend to run a few tests and they've documented. The Sea Shepherd has done that. They've documented these whalers and they're doing it in whale sanctuaries. They're doing the places where it shouldn't be done, but it's not monitored by anyone except for sea shepherd. End of the world, brother fucking. It's not though because this is the first time ever where people are wildly aware of this kind of activity and this is where I credit this show. I'm telling you, I'm sitting here before you as a fan, first and foremost, you've illuminated so many issues and like broadened my spectrum of my consciousness so much I am. Now. I can tell you I am in the seat of that of your millions of listeners. I am that person right now.

Speaker 1:          01:59:27       St Himself. Damn. I wish I could be on that fucking show. I just happen to do something that, you know, my, my life circumstances just ultimately led me here, but I am that guy and I have to extend another, you know, a big thank you for ultimately shaping a paradigm that is shifting so God damn fast and so many different levels and so many different topics out there. And largely what you did started what six years ago, I believe it was when you started the podcast, you know, you're the guy who did this so well. I couldn't have done it if it wasn't for people like you being on the show though. Well all I'm doing is having conversations with cool people. It's this whole thing has made itself. It's very bizarre. I love that. My ass is in some way of making physical contact with some awesome assets that have sat here.

Speaker 1:          02:00:09       Man. You know, we're sharing an interesting way of looking at it. I love it. I love him running up against. It's going on. Be able to grasp radon. He wasn't in that one that was old, old seats already mentioned. These are pretty, these are dope, right? Yeah. They are saying to Ergo depot for uh, providing me with these, these are called [inaudible] Pisco chairs because people constantly ask me on twitter. There are super comfortable. They're ergonomic chairs well to, well they move well, but here's the most important thing. These are the only chairs I have ever sat in that are comfortable that I can sit for a three hour podcasts and my back doesn't hurt. It's got the lumbar support and yeah. Well when I leave let's just forces you to sit in a way where your direct, which is how we're supposed to sit. And when I would sit in like a standard office chair by the end of the day, my back is all fucked up from Jujitsu.

Speaker 1:          02:00:54       So like the middle of my back would be hurting like hell leave podcast and I'd be all stiff. I leave these like I like, I just like I feel right now like I just sat down like it doesn't bother me at all. Yeah. Full disclosure, I was moving in my seat because I'm just fidgety guy. Comfortable these ergonomic chairs, man, they are the future. They are the, they are the present there, there, there, there is so much better than a regular office chair. Regular office chairs cause you to sit in as sort of a weird way unless you consciously like I need to get these fucking things to the UFC because when I sit and watch the UFC for six hours, I sit like a hot chick on instagram. Like when they stick their ass out. That's how I sit. I've purposely forced myself to sit in this unnatural way.

Speaker 1:          02:01:38       Whereas if I had chairs like this, I would just uh, yeah. So ergo depot Holler at me, we'll send these bitches over to the UFC and the UFC has um, you know, they use the chairs that are there at the Mandalay bay or mgm or whatever. But my point is these are the shit. Yeah, the great. Um. Anything else before we wrap this thing up? Everything else I could talk for hours, man. Wrap it up and let him do anything else important that we left off the table. Oh Shit can. I know you got a whole notebook there, dude. You're like a comedian. You have like notes. It's my process. Oh, AG gag laws. You're familiar with ag gag laws is agriculture laws that a factory farming and the perfect example of what we're going through. This is a microcosm of what we're dealing with.

Speaker 1:          02:02:18       Greenland sort of gets creative and sort of creating their own little law, the Ag gag sort of procedures with existing laws, but yeah, these ag gag laws are just a. just an absolute. Just the fucking horrible thing. I mean to to to be able to prosecute and punish people that are trying to expose the truth of farming and agriculture practices. This is absurd. This is fucking crazy, right? Yeah. Well what they're doing is if people have a video, like a cell phone video or something like that, and you film pigs in captivity or chickens or anything in agriculture where they have factory farming, you can get sued and you can go to jail. Like you can go to jail for exposing something that makes people sick and a reality of business. If you're buying something. I feel like if I'm buying a chicken and then I find out, oh, I can no longer be detached from this process because now I know exactly how this chicken left and I feel horrible about it.

Speaker 1:          02:03:17       I've been educated and so that company needs to change its practices because I don't want to buy chickens from them anymore and if some people do, that's fine with them, but to stop people from filming that and showing you what you're trying to keep people in the dark or misleading people, what you're, you're, you're hiding facts, you're hiding truth. That's not cool and this is exactly what we're dealing with in reality. Right? It's the same fucking thing. Yeah, it is. It is. It is exactly the same thing. Hiding truth, hiding reality and, and, and trying to keep people from being aware of what's essentially torture. You know, I buy as little meat as possible and no eggs. I don't buy any eggs from anyway unless I'm in a restaurant or something like that. For your own chickens. I have my own chickens and I, I have like, I've, I have a good feeling.

Speaker 1:          02:04:08       I my chickens, like me, they come to me like I come out to them and I bring food and like what's up kids? Hey girls and I put the plate down there. They're not scared of me. They run over and they lay eggs and I take the eggs. Sometimes they pick on me when I tried to steal their eggs but like reach under them to take him, but they barely know me. That could, you could take them, but my point is it's like I enjoy that relationship and I know that not everybody can have that sort of relationship, but that is what you want. If you want eggs, like Peta has these really ridiculous campaigns against chickens and against eggs where they call it a chicken period and they have a frying pan on their website with a pair of panties that has like a, a fucking bloody spot on the panties and you're frying the period.

Speaker 1:          02:04:55       It's so bizarre. Have you ever seen any Jamie? Pull it up. Periods tasted as good as eggs. I don't think there'd be an issue, but there is. Don't do something with Jesus. Come on. How dare you take a penny? What's the problem? How dare you keep going? Um, the problem is captivity. It's not eggs. Joel Salitan, who is a really fascinating guy. I had him on my podcast and he's an advocate of, of what you would call natural farming when he, when he, um, has pigs, what he does is he puts this enormous, um, electrical fence up and the pigs, they don't want to go near the fence. It's sort of, it doesn't hurt him, zaps them so they don't pass it. And then they moved the fence so they continue to graze and new property. So they're eating acorns and roots and all natural things that pigs eat.

Speaker 1:          02:05:41       And that's what he does with these pigs, with chickens. The same thing. He has these enormous chicken houses and they roll them to new environments. And so on his farm, this chicken house, um, the, the, the Hen House has rollers on it and they'll move it to a new area. And the chickens, my chickens, I opened the gates and my chickens run around my yard and then they go back in the hen house at night. It's what they do, they so stimulating for them because they get a new environment all the time. Yes, and they're free. They're literally free and when you get eggs from those kinds of chickens or a dark orange, like a really dark, deep orange, and that's because it's much healthier than when you see something that says like vegetarian fed chickens. Guess what? Chickens aren't vegetarians. They're fucking dinosaurs. I fed my chickens a mouse once and here's another example of like the hierarchy of animals.

Speaker 1:          02:06:30       We love animals we don't love. It's really interesting how this happened in my house. My kids found a hawk. The Hawk slammed into a, I think a window or something. Not sure we weren't there, but we found this wounded Hawk so my kids decided that we were going to do is we're going to take this hawk and get it to a wildlife rescue organization. So they had to feed it because it was over the weekend and the rescue organization wasn't open, so they went to the pet store and they got the called Pinkies, which are these little tiny mice. Yeah. For the people listening, their mice that haven't their baby mice and they use them to feed snakes and stuff like that, and so they fed the hawk, these pinkies and there was one pinky left and they got the hock to the wildlife rescue organization. The Hawk was taken care of and everything and hopefully was released into the wild, but we had one pinky leftover.

Speaker 1:          02:07:22       My daughter wanted to raise it and I said, sweetie, this is going to die. It's not. It has to eat milk. It's only been alive for a few days. It's just not going to last. I'm amazed it's still alive and she was crying and I said, but we just fed them to the hawks. Do you understand this? I go, there's one of two things we should do. I go, we should either bring it back to the pet store. No, I go, listen, if we don't bring it back to the pet store, it's going to die. We bring them back to the pet store, the pets pet store. I don't know if the mouse will accept it. Now that we've got our scent on it. I don't know how that works, but they're going to feed it to a snake. There's going to resell that. Someone's gonna, someone's gonna buy it or it might die because it hasn't eaten in 24 hours.

Speaker 1:          02:08:02       I don't know. And our other option is we give it to the chickens and they're crying and this and at this point had you known that the chicken was likely to eat this thing or I've seen them eat a mouse before. Really? They're fucking ruthless, ruthless. Like I put that mouse down. It was not down on the ground for a fucking half a second when one chicken slammed it grow, got it in his beak and the other chickens were chasing this chicken around the cit. The Hen house like this chicken couldn't pause to try to eat this because all the other chickens knew what had had and they were running around. He couldn't. He couldn't stop. It was running and it's trying to eat it and the other chickens are running with it and it was just. I should've filmed it. I had no idea to.

Speaker 1:          02:08:45       They're monsters. They are with each other and they like to pick the shit out of each other and they pack everything. Here's what's fucked up man. They picked my daughter a couple of times and one time I almost killed one of them because it packed her face. And um, my wife is like, it doesn't know. I go, listen, listen, it's trying to eat her. It just can't. Do you need to get this in your head. It's not that he doesn't know. It knows she's alive and it's trying to fucking eat eater. And if we held her down, those chickens would eat her. She's like, you just, you, you get crazy with this. I go, I'm telling you right now. They are fucking dinosaurs. They are cold blooded. There they have, they have the fucking brain of a pencil eraser. Okay. Little tiny on the tip of your pencil.

Speaker 1:          02:09:23       That's how big their fucking brain is. Walk. Fuck. Fight. Exactly. They'll eat everything. They follow my wife around like she'll like lift up rocks and they dive under the rock to try to get worms and anything that's there, the little predators, man, are straight up predators. So when you see you like vegetarian fed doesn't, those are good eggs and not doing any service to that. They're omnivores, they're omnivores and they would eat meat all day long above grass if you gave it to them. They like that more like my lawn is filled with grass and they pick up the grass and they eat all kinds of other stuff too. And they eat the chicken food that we bought. We tried to buy the most nutritious chicken food available. There's some brands that are like more more diverse and the the, the, the food and the nutrients that are in them.

Speaker 1:          02:10:04       But the bottom line is they abandoned all that shit. When they see something live, they'd try to eat living things. That's what they want to do. That's the thing we got to be scared of most is chickens. They're going to get big, which is lucky. The little. Yeah. Well you ever heard of terror? Birds like to tell people that all the time. It's just like, if you don't think that that cat wouldn't fucking eat you. If it was just a significantly larger believe you'd have a different respect for, oh fuck you. For a the ammo and the idea that eating meat is. Yeah, dude, fuck. Like a large mouth bass. Your swimming pool big enough for large mouth bass teacher. You're done like a group or have you ever seen those groupers and Florida? They would eat a baby. One hundred percent gay babies floating around group would come up.

Speaker 1:          02:10:38       There was a nutty video of a group or eating a shark. I saw. Isn't that crazy? I'm crazy. The shark was like Three v swallowed it. Just put her into jumper. Mammoth fucking animal. It's like a giant large mouth bass from the hobbit movie. It's crazy. They don't even seem real. I don't know how big they get, but I think it's hundreds and hundreds of pounds that massively. This. Here it is. These people, they caught a shark and they put the camera in the water to film this group or that's coming up to the shark, so they have a small shark on the hook and as they're reeling it in and they're bringing it in and they see this video could use some editing and as they're reeling it in, they've got this shot. It's not a small shark, it's about three feet long, maybe even more.

Speaker 1:          02:11:20       I might even be four feet and this group or comes along and some mashes it as they're trying to get it out of the water. Look at this. Boom says great. I mean that group has got to be two, 300 pounds. I don't know how big they get, but I would assume they get to be like three or 400 pounds. How big your group is, Jeremy? Well now let's. Let's end this with groupers. Those they taste good though. Do you ever have a grouper sandwich? No, I haven't. I don't know if you would want to eat it. Old One like that. Probably not. Yeah, they get a little. I don't know. I don't know if that's the case with fish. I know it's definitely the case with fish. Is it? I go fishing. You don't want to keep your 11 pound Walleye. You want to eat the like a three and like smell really three pounds.

Speaker 1:          02:12:01       Why? I went wildlife fishing for the first time last year with good eating. Anxious perch and yeah, and Alberta. Man. How big they get two point five meters. Eight feet. Oh my God. They can weigh as much as 790 pounds. Holy fucking shit. Wow. That is insane. I had no idea. Eight feet. That could eat you. 700 fucking pounds. That is so crazy. Wow. I did not know. They got that big. Oh my God. Eight feet. Imagine Shaquille o'neal. A foot bigger than him is a grouper. That's insane. Look at the size of that thing is one with a dude. Oh my God. This thing is bigger than the guy. Look at the little fishes thing on the other side of the guy going like, fuck no, I'm not coming. I was thinking I'd find you. It's hoping that the group or like taking chunks out of that guy and like leaves a little for him.

Speaker 1:          02:12:56       God, ocean is awesome. The ocean is so amazing. Deep Ocean. The more you learn about it. I mean you see in Japan that massive. A massive squid. Yeah, that's crazy. The swimming. I don't want to swim anywhere near that fucking thing. That's a. that's an evil Predator right there. You didn't know when it gets stuck in those tentacles. Oh yeah. They are really evil and they're so big. They're the. What's really nuts is that giant squid were just a myth and a couple of decades ago they had no idea if they were real like they had. They had never caught one of these things on camera. Now they have one. It looked like it was in a base somewhere because it was really close to boats. It was crazy to look to allowing people to swim in it. Like they never caught one before. Like they didn't know if they were real then catching them.

Speaker 1:          02:13:35       I wouldn't swim with that thing. I want to have a catching them so because they're catching them much more frequently now. Like look at it, look at the video of it. My God, what an amazing, amazing creature. The entire body flexible. Nothing but a beak like as far as the only thing that's hard. Do you know, they found evidence really recently of a gigantic, some, some sort of octopus type species that would be like a cracking their thinking by the size of the tentacles. This thing would be 100 feet long and they found these enormous tentacles that were like, you know, dinner plates and they're, they're saying, okay, well this is what the myths of the crack and I've always been. The crack was always this gigantic tentacled monster that would eat anything. I look at that fucking well, it's hard to perspective when you see it with a person, you get a real good idea of how, how enormous it is.

Speaker 1:          02:14:25       But I think that thing is like 18 feet long or something crazy. But these crackings the. There's nothing left of them when they die. So what they found is a fossilized remains of the tentacles had dot when they went into died, the tentacles had left an imprint on the ground, on the bottom of the ocean. And so that's the got the fossilized remains of these tentacles. They're like, Holy Shit. And they realized, well, okay, well this is where these myths come from. This was a real, a real creature. It's amazing how little we know in terms of what the deep ocean and has available to it in terms of, uh, of, uh, animal life. Oh, it's crazy. We're discovering stuff every day. Yeah. They say we know more about the moon than we know about the ocean. Well, it's, it's, what is it? Seventy percent of the earth or something like that.

Speaker 1:          02:15:10       Something percent. Some giant percentage of the earth is water and the ocean floor, I think they've only examined like five percent of it, which is amazing. So 95 percent of this incredible, essentially wild world. Meaning it is a wild world and it'll ultimately comes from the ocean. The ocean is what gives us life. That's where we have to respect. Supposedly it all came from, right. We all started off somehow or another as some little fucking fish thing. I got to watch more cosmos. That's another thing. I can't get enough. I know, right? I'm so glad they brought that back with. Especially with Neil degrasse Tyson's. Great. Great podcast too. It's called startalk. It's awesome. It's really good. Definitely check that out and it's all about a bunch of different subjects to like, he had a really cool one with David Byrne from the talking hands about creativity and he's just a really interesting curious guy.

Speaker 1:          02:15:58       Neil degrasse Tyson had got a great demeanor and I liked the way they do the cosmos with the, with the sort of, um, the, the imagination and the animation, the animation. It's great. It's awesome. Great. It's a very engaging. Um, so we're good. Anything else? Yes. All that safe. Smooshy.com. Follow me at a.
