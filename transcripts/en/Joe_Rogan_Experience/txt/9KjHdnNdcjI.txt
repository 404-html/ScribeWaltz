Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Oh no, go ahead, click the button and we're waiting on them. I'd hate for you to drop some awesome knowledge and we're alive. That's it. Steve Rinella. The only hunting show ever in the history of mediator or excuse me of Netflix, have meat eater. That's a. that's an awesome accomplishment, man. You're the first hunting with. See, I tell everybody that if you want to watch a hunting show, I feel like people watch hunting shows and they go, oh, these shit. What the fuck are these guys doing? They're sitting around. I go, well, look at that blue, the size of this book, my own. This is amazing. Your show is so different from all those other shows like it belongs on something else. It belongs on like the history channel or discovery channel or something more mainstream. So I'm glad that Netflix picked it up. Oh Man, I'm delighted they picked up 32 episodes. I'm glad we got to this plugin part right away. Right away. Yeah, because if I turn people off and they tune out, they'll remember this man, this is great. I can just walk out the fucking door right now. Nobody episodes. How many episodes have you guys done? All told?

Speaker 2:          00:01:00       No, no. Have more than 75. Way More than 75. I think. So there's sort of. Just remember one day we had a little. I remember one day I was having a drink to celebrate us having wrapped number 50 and that was long time ago. So we're way past that now. Wow, that's a good question. It's a lot of weeks. Upwards of 75. It's a lot of weeks out in the field. Yeah, the hundredth. Yeah. We'll probably have a little party on the hundredth episode, but no, it's been, it's been great man. I mean the Netflix thing is really just. I mean it really, you know, exposed to a lot of, you know, a lot of people and it was cool. They instead of starting with season one, you know, they put up season five and six a Netflix, which is nice because it makes people real curious about the other ones.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       There's one episode that's probably one of my favorite episodes you ever did where you never shot anything. So one episode with you alone, deer hunting. And he started talking about your dad.

Speaker 2:          00:01:52       Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Arizona area. No music, a lot of ambient sound, loud wind who makes those choices, like those editorial choices that was, you know, the Ed or one of our editors, kind of one of our core editors, the editors that's been doing it for a long time. A guy by the name of guy. He, um, yeah, he, he did that. And at first I was like, Huh, what? Because he wanted. Yeah, he wanted to do one, no music. There's no vo on it, you know, and we're pretty vo heavy, sound pretty tend to be a voiceover, like I do a lot of narrating, you know, um, in fact I was just writing some narration for the United recently, but I do a lot of narrating and then we just did one with, there's no narrating. And I think a lot of times it comes down to how talkative I'm feeling in the field, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:02:44       Um, and yeah, I just, whatever, for whatever reason I was suffering a little bit of exhaustion or something. I just did a lot of rambling. And then when he started cutting it together, he just wanted to run it like that with no sound at all. We want to one night with no music at all. No, no, no voiceover, no. No narration. Just all spoken to camera. No other people there. So everything just like not delivered his dialogue, just like two camera dressing. We talk now about doing one that has no words in it, but it's all music maybe I was looking for. I was looking for like, excitement to register on Joe's face and I got the opposite. Yeah. Well that's one of the things that I think is most ridiculous about a lot of hunting shows. Just how terrible the music is. Some of the music choices.

Speaker 2:          00:03:34       Just like, what did you guys just go to fucking, uh, what is that program that you have on your Mac? When is that a garage. Garage band? Yeah. Pick up some beats and I don't know the name of the system that we use, but it's a, you know, it's, it's a searchable database of music, like a catalog of music. The documentary we're doing, we're, we're beginning now to work on, we're in the initial stages of, you know, having it scored, which is fun because it's not something I've ever messed with, you know, like I, I think we're very rarely in a television show or do you have a television show scored, you know, you're usually using library music or licensed music. You know, I was watching westworld the other night, which is an awesome show if you haven't seen it. But uh, there was one scene with his music started playing.

Speaker 2:          00:04:17       I'm like, this is so bad. I hate this. I hate when I'm being manipulated by music during a scene. Like if the music is telling you to where you're like, where they come up to and they're like, man, you're not going to feel like this isn't making you feel how we wish it made you feel. Perhaps if we played this, you'll feel this way more. Yeah. It's weird that we just, this is the part where you're supposed to feel, you know, kind of like a feelings of nostalgia and, and you know, and like these remorseful feelings and we have no idea how to invoke that in audiences. But this musician did a wonderful job some years ago. Let's play this. It's always like violins and shit, piano, it, there's something about that that's just, I feel so manipulated, like I should just get into it, right? Because you're accepting these are stories of success of like, you're, you're giving me a program, you're showing me something in an hour.

Speaker 2:          00:05:13       You, there's all these edits. We're going back and why can't I just accept that, you know? Uh, there's a, there's a musician I liked quite a bit named Micah p Henson, and he's, he's out at Abilene, Texas and he has a song called the de Texas sank to the bottom of the sea. And a friend of mine who's a screenwriter, we have joked about someday writing a movie. So sad that you could play that song at the end. It would not feel manipulative like movies. So sad. It could earn to have the day text, the sank to the bottom of the sea, played in the end of it. What's his name again? Mike? A P hints and Micah and my ca. Yeah, a h, a h? Yeah. Seems like a young fellow. I don't know. Seems like a young fellow. He seems like he's got a background in drug

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       taken a one of those guys. Um, but uh, I really, uh, yeah, he's a good musician, man. Yeah. There's something about music in movies that we've just totally, we just totally accept it in television shows and music when there's a scene and they want to manipulate you and they want to establish some sort of a feeling that you're supposed to invoke. They just lay it in there. The radio head album. OK. Computer has a song called exit music for film because I think they just felt like it would be. They're trying to send a message to the licensers. Yeah. It's a wonder who was the first. I guess they did that back in the movies before there was talkies, you know, it was all when movies were silent. I mean, that's how they sort of manipulated you and then they showed the screen and they had the words on it that, oh yeah, like the Peter and the wolf thing and then it just carried over. But yeah. Well we're working on the show with music.

Speaker 4:          00:06:55       Um,

Speaker 3:          00:06:57       I've, I've a hard time describing visual stuff, you know, like I'll often see something like a visual treatment for something, you know, or artwork or whatever. I'm like, I don't know. I can't disappear. I'll know it when I see it. I'll know that I like it, but I can't tell you what I like and when we're doing it. And I listened to music when the editor is putting something together and I hear music, I never have suggestions. I always just have no, it's like, it's me. It's like, it's like, yes, no, yes, no. And I never could be like, make it more, you know, I don't know, I just had to hear it and I'd be like, oh, that's, it's too heavy handed or not. I saw one show where they were deer hunting and there was electronic music playing. I was like, who chose this? Well, they might be trying to create like a weird tension.

Speaker 3:          00:07:47       Yeah. Make you upset. Yeah. That way you want the deer to die because they're forcing you to listen to this music. There's a great compilation of a hawks. I think they're a rough legged hawks. Maybe I can't remember what time, but uh, just bitch slap and Mallard ducks up in Canada and the guy said it to hell's bells now. Always thought that it was the obvious choice, but just has a great effect watching a hawks killed docs to hell's bells. Um, but other than that, no, I like it to be. I always kinda like it to be not obvious. Like, you know, like let's say you're doing a show in West Virginia and so on and be like, oh yeah, we kick it off of some Banjo music, you know what I mean? It's like I hate that kind of decision making, you know, cliche. Yeah. And then, and then I don't like it to be like electronica to deer hunting. Like you kind of want it to be sort of like, not obvious, but. Right. Yeah. Like who was it that decided to outer space sounds the way it does, like no one shows images of outer space to Banjo. Good point. And show images of outer space like do, do, do, do you know? Or

Speaker 5:          00:08:59       it's gotta be like Star Wars, symphony type music.

Speaker 3:          00:09:03       Someone decided to outer space feels like a kind of music. So if I was doing something about outer space, I would want to find something that you'd never guess was outer spacey sounding, but in the end you're like, yeah, you know what, that's not out of place for outer space. Like a harmonica. Sure,

Speaker 5:          00:09:23       sure. I'll know when I hear it. I hear it. You'd have to enlist a bunch of the world best harmonica players who come up with something spacey. Yeah. That'd be to watch outer space stuff. I think like a didgeridoo would work for space now. You could do that, but that, but the, all the, all the, all the editors

Speaker 3:          00:09:41       all that music up for when they got to cut to an Australia thing. That's true, right? Really? What's Australia sound like? Oh, that's right. The degree do. Um, but yeah man, Netflix, it's, it's a, it's got a lot of emails and people kind of stumbling out of the show and it's funny because you make a show about hunting and you want to like in your head you're like, people that like to hunt would have found it, but then you, you hear it from people who hunt their asses off and they're like, hey, I just discovered the show and it's, and you realize this, all these people, like all the, the untapped millions that are out there.

Speaker 5:          00:10:17       Yeah. Well there's a lot of people like me before I ever started hunting that are interested in it. They think it's interesting and I think the gateway drug for them as those Alaska shows those like subsistence hunter shows like the last frontier and the mountain men chose. They show these people are like, wow, that looks cool. Yeah. You know, and then I think the next step is to switch on over the sportsmans channel or something like that. And something interesting point. But you can get turned off really easily. You could go to the wrong kind of show and it can be boring or you can stumble upon, like I always say about uncharted, the Jim shockey show. Have you seen that show? I have a great show and it, to me it's not really a hunting show. It's a show about cultures and travel and culture.

Speaker 5:          00:10:59       Yeah. It's about a really curious, open minded guy who loves to go to different cultures and he goes there, you know, and the premises. He goes there to hunt, but he's, he's traveled to some really, really incredible places and film some amazing stuff. Did you see the one where he went to? Um, I forget what river it was in Africa where these people have a significant problem with crocodiles eating. Oh no I didn't, but I've talked to some people about that one. Everybody in the village was like missing an arm. They had a hole in their head. This. Everybody had been jacked and while he was there, a woman got taken. No, it was crazy watching these people wail and cry and sob. It was really, really intense. You know what? I was in a

Speaker 3:          00:11:43       seventh grade. We had a teacher named Ms Dot Merkel. I don't know if she's alive anymore, but I remember she lived down the Muskegon river. She was in the Peace Corps and one, look at this. What we'll see is the hands on your kid and you realize later. It's weird. One day she brought in a photograph

Speaker 3:          00:12:00       of her, I believe it was her fiance at the time of his body after it had been removed from a crocodile's stomach. Holy Shit. To show us now to set that, to set the times. I also, when I was in ninth grade, there was a teacher named Mr Wright and he wanted me to read blue, a shotgun form. You know the bluing on the shotgun, like the coding on a shotgun and blew it. Yeah. How do you do that? What is it? It's a chemical dip. You Strip it and then it's like a chemical treatment blooming blooming. It's kind of fallen out of favor, but everything used to be blue. Anyways, just set scene like for what you could do back then that you don't do now. He gave a shotgun to a kid, brought shotgun school, gave me the shotgun. I took her home, reboot it. You know what? He paid me back with what? He gave me a 25 caliber semiautomatic handgun in a sweat sock

Speaker 5:          00:12:59       school. I brought it home and my dad confiscated it from me and I never saw it again. Wow. So the teacher gave you a hand gun. What the fuck is this teacher doing? Give me that. Yeah. Wow. Twenty five caliber. Semi auto in a sweat soc as payment for blue and his shotgun. The transaction all happened at [inaudible]. Is that in Michigan? It's my high school. So when I say the shadow,

Speaker 3:          00:13:28       she had a photo of a guy's body coming out of a crocodile. It's like just the, you know, that's not that long ago though. No, I'm 43 now. How old am I? 40 two times have changed pretty radically. Oh yeah. I remember when they instituted the rule that you couldn't have firearms at school and I remember going down and talking to Mr Backman and being like, hey, you know, and he's like, oh yeah, of course. I mean, you know, you guys aren't

Speaker 5:          00:13:53       and everything so you can stick a gun in your locker. Have it

Speaker 3:          00:13:58       your car in the parking lot though. Wow. Now for our documentary, we interviewed a guy who used to get on his school bus with his shotgun, Holy Shit in Martha's vineyard of all places and he would get on the school bus with the shotgun. Wow. So yeah. So he could hunt ducks afterschool. Whoa. How old is this guy? Old. He's a Vietnam veteran.

Speaker 6:          00:14:23       Wow.

Speaker 5:          00:14:26       What happened? What happened? Started shooting people at school. I don't know if we could answer that. I've been talking about this a lot. What happened to go and postal? What did the post office figure out how the post office get it together? Like why did that stop happening? Like was it. It was a huge issue. There was a game called postal. There was a video game that you could play in the early days of video game called postal and this is another thing that you probably couldn't do today, but there was a video game based on mass shootings. We'd go to a post office just fuck everybody up, but was, I don't remember. I, I know. Of course I remembered that, but I don't remember word. They're actually like more than two. Yeah, I was going to say it's called running with scissors. Was the company that made it look like this is the fucking game you would just run around and shoot people and chop them up and got them down. I mean, it's terrible graphics because it's the early days of gun or excuse me with video games? No, it looks like my six year old did the pictures, but this is the game and this is like the original grand theft daughter auto. Really? Yeah. How can we could just go over the roof like that shitty ass physics.

Speaker 5:          00:15:40       Yeah. I mean going postal was a thing that people used to say all the time, but if you said, uh, he went postal to like a tire now you know, people talk about. I think people will use. Use it as being. You got real mad. I think it's a murderous thing. No, I know. But once it became in the lexicon, you know, you could say like, Oh yeah, you know, he went and posted all about me, not, you know. Right. Sending them the check. But you could say going postal because you're 42, but could you say postal if you're 22, I don't think a 22 year old. Any idea what you're talking about? Something happened. It ended the, the, the, the, the phenomena. Yeah. What did the post office do? Questioning is. What was it based on? Two things. Three. Monotony. Inbox. Outbox inbox outbox. No. Yeah, but I mean, I mean, how many postal, how many, how many exam were there at post offices? Jamie's pulled them up here. Look at this to a 19, 86, 1991. Ninety one again, two events in [inaudible] 93 and took a 13 year height and then it came back strong in 2006. Baker city, Oregon, 2006. So 2006. It seems like that was the last postal event.

Speaker 5:          00:17:03       Says that was based around these ones in 1986 is where the term started. So it probably is just a novelty thing, like one person did it and then a bunch of other people. Well, I wonder if there's a disproportionate amount of mass shootings and post offices as compared to other warehouse jobs or other. I mean, because there's been mass shootings at work before, but for some reason that distinction got put on post office said 35 people and 11 incidents that is high. It's fairly high, but when you're, you know, you're dealing with the number of people that come in and out of the post office. Irate. Yeah. But it's one of those weird things. It's like, why don't you see that about Jiffy Lube? There's no Jiffy Lube, mass shootings, you know? Yeah. I can't answer that. I bet there's people who studied at carefully. I read the book, I read the Book Columbine. Oh yeah, yeah. You read that book? No, I didn't, but I just got a book from one of the kids that survived, uh, met him. He was with Marilyn Manson at this podcast that we did for the election night, the end of the world podcast. And uh, he gave me a copy of his book. He survived, they came up to him right before the shooting and they said, hey man, we like, you get the fuck outta here. Really? Yeah. And he left and guns started blazing. He survived.

Speaker 6:          00:18:25       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:18:26       that'd be a good guy to have on your show. I'm going to have them on the guy to go to calm him by me. The guy that wrote Columbine. Columbine is a good book man. I mean as far as the psychology of, of, you know, the psychology and background and context of shooters. It's, it's a good book. It's an intense phenomenon, you know, that is attributed to North America more than anywhere. I mean you starting to see a lot more mass shootings all across the world, but a lot of them are religious related, but it's, it's, it's a very, it's a very confusing one to people because there's so many factors involved, you know, and it's one that gets lumped in with a gun culture. Like, this is a tweet that I put on my twitter page while back that I said this country has a mental health problem disguised as a gun problem.

Speaker 5:          00:19:10       You know, and I really, really believe that. I just, I don't think you can attribute, there's so many guns in this country and so few mass shootings. There's so many guns. I mean the number of guns exceeds the number of people and the amount of mass shootings in relative. Obviously they're all horrible, horrific and terrible, but relatively to the, to the amount of people that we have, it's relatively small. I think that the kind of person that can engage in something like that, there's so many factors and you can't blame it on guns. It's like blaming forks on people, getting fat. It doesn't make sense. You know, like when you look at the tendency to want to like grasp bond to somewhat easy solutions for stuff,

Speaker 5:          00:19:58       it's something people go to. Yes. Because it's like, it seems conquerable you know, so people go, people look at like a really complex thing. We saw so much this during the round of the presidential election where, you know, to make a point really fast, you look at something that's terrifically complex and it's not just that you want the magic solution, but who would kind of go like, well, what could be pop, what possibly could be done? And I think people move in the direction of moving in the direction of the second amendment. And there's also this sort of an agreement that people have when discussing it. Like yes, guns are a problem and that guns are a problem because these things happen. And then they all start talking about guns and then if we get lumped into two groups, you get lumped into people that are pro second amendment that go, no, no, no, it's not guns. And then the people that say, wow, those crazy people with guns, you know, Obama. That was one of the famous, one of the famous statement that he said during his administration is how people are so attached to their guns and, and the, the second amendment people got so mad. The NRA. People like the cling into religion and guns.

Speaker 3:          00:21:02       Yeah. Yeah, it's, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:21:05       if you just look at the sheer number of people who actually have guns in this country, it is a little crazy. I mean the volume is very, very high. The actual number of firearms and the thing that always gets me is they don't, it's not like they stopped making them. I mean they're making guns every day, you know, a lot less now since the election. Really. Yeah. I had this trump white friends, right. Are

Speaker 3:          00:21:25       So convinced that um, you know, or like, like most people in the country or whether you liked it or not, we're convinced that Clinton was gonna win, you know, and they, they had, I got it. I got one friend in particular that went out and bought a bunch of stocks for company, you know, fire her companies and he said they took a little hit after the election because people are relaxed. They didn't worry about stockpiling. People aren't worried about stock pond. I mean we were all talking about it is like the, the, the, the stockpiling thing is self perpetuating. Where when I, when I was a little kid, you know, in our Christmas stocking we would get bricks at 22 shells because we use 22, we'd hunt small, we'd done a lot of squirrels and rabbits, 20 twos and it's just like you always at 22 shells, you know, you could go anywhere and get 22 shells, a body mind one of our camera guys, he grew up on a ranch and at the ranch store they had two items chew, so tins of chew in 22 shells that you could get on credit at the ranch store.

Speaker 3:          00:22:26       The ranch store was a, had a very limited inventory, but that's like how pervasive 22 shells were. Now when Obama won, you know, no one's going to use it. Twenty two, 22 is not a goto caliber for, for doing, inflicting harm on other human beings. It's, it's, you know, it's just not a great. It's a very small, small game round. But the history about guns drove people to gobble up 22 animal. So all of a sudden then it was you couldn't find 20 to animal and not being able to find it. Like I used to just buy these little boxes of 50, right? It, you go like, oh, it's hard to buy it and then all of a sudden you've gotten the need where you wanted to buy all you could get because it was in your head that you couldn't get it. So then you'd see a thousand of them and I'd be like, I'm going to buy it because everyone's buying it.

Speaker 3:          00:23:11       And I think it was self perpetuating. Now I got shitloads of 22 shifts. But I was like, I had no need for them. I just, I, I felt in this thing like there's this thing that I've always had access to and I won't have access to it, you know? And, and it, I don't know where it came from. And I think that now all through the last eight years, there's been just this, there's been this like great arming of America because I feel like so many people were worried about having their rights and fringed it was like, there's like, at least now in that community of which I'm apart, I suppose there's a, there's a, there's a sigh of relief. You. Yeah, there's a great relaxation amongst sports when they think that trump is gonna come in and, you know, protect the second amendment rights.

Speaker 3:          00:23:53       But a lot of people got to do, have to be worried about private land or public land. Yeah. That's the thing that I'm really watching. Um, and I'm curious about it, you know, at this point, you know, the talks over, right, the rhetorics over. So now I'm a for, you know, whether someone was forward or against it for or against trump's victory. I think now like the responsible thing to do in my mind are the realistic, responsible thing to do. My mind is because there's so many unknowns, just approached the administration with an open mind. I mean, you know, be like, now I'm like, okay, the talks over now like what's gonna, what's gonna happen, like what sorts of things that we're going to see come out of it and I don't know if anyone really knows the answer to that and, and like in my outward public facing way, I don't generally talk about politics outside of issues that relate to wildlife issues that relate to hunters and fishermen.

Speaker 3:          00:24:54       Right. Like I kind of focused in because I politically, I'm a mess, you know, I'm all over the place. Um, I have no use for and I know you don't either. I have no use for like classic definitions of conservatives, liberals to just, that shit makes no sense to me. Like I don't get, I don't draw my viewpoints from going and looking and finding out how I'm supposed to feel about it in order to be like a consistent part isn't individual. Um, last January though, uh, for people who aren't even theirs, I'm sure it's probably a lot of people aren't familiar with this. Can I get, can I give a quick rundown on public lands? Yeah. So the federal government has holds, owns millions and millions of acres of land in the US, primarily in the western us. And there's a handful of different land holding agencies. You have the bureau of land management, manages lands, the US fish and wildlife service manages lands through the refuge system.

Speaker 3:          00:25:47       So when those boys, uh, in Oregon took over the wildlife refuge there, that was a, that was actually, um, us fish and wildlife service land wasn't blm land. You've got the national forest holds Land National Forest Service, which is under the Usta already said the Blm, right? Yeah. Um, and then of course you have, you know, a states owned public land, but the but the federal land management agencies of which there are several hold deed to millions acres land and, and they wrap it is owned by the American people and it's represented through, you might think of it as represented through a trust and the trust is administered by the federal government on your behalf. That's our public lands where people recreate, um, oh, another large holder of public lands and National Parks Service. I didn't mention that one. A gene in the lower 48, you don't, you don't hunt on national park land, you fish on national park land and you generally haunt national land bureau, land management, land refuge land, and uh, there's a push right now to the people feel that we should, that the federal government should be dumping a lot of federal land.

Speaker 3:          00:26:55       Um, now the, for what reason, why you asked that, that's what I'm good at. So people get frustrated with dealing with the federal bureaucracy. And the reason that is, is generally the feds are pretty. I mean this is a gross generalization, but generally the feds are pretty, are much slower on exploitation of natural resources, less responsive to demand for exploitation, natural resources than state agencies are. So federal lands, you know, they're there. They in exercising the will of the American people, federal land agencies are, I'm not as easy to deal with when it comes to mining and development and other issues as state agencies are. So people who are, who want to see a more readily exploitable system in place for, for developers, miners, loggers, others will want to see like people able to more readily make a buck off the land, they'd like to see these lands that are federal lands, they'd like to see him go into private hands or like to see him go into state hands because they know that either way it goes, if they go into private hands or state lands, they're gonna have a much easier time doing extractive industries in development on those lands.

Speaker 3:          00:28:16       So that's what that's like under the surface. What's going on? Um, and then for instance, like the guy, you know, one of the reasons the guys that took over the refuge, the, a wildlife refuge in Oregon, one of their gripes was they run cattle on public property, right? So they pay a fee that one of those families is heavily involved in running cattle on federal land and they pay a fee far below the going rate to run cattle on public lands. So this is what you'd go pay a branch, or if you wanted to run cattle on his land, they pay about 10 percent of that by some estimations to run it on public land. And then when federal land managers don't want to renew those contracts because again, because people are thinking about other issues, other uses for the land or whatever they want to do with it, it causes an intense amount of, like a serious amount of frustration with people.

Speaker 3:          00:29:07       So there's people don't want to dump lands. Now, I heard Donald Trump speak, uh, last January, so almost a year ago in Las Vegas, and he was standing 40 yards away from me and was talking about the that he has no desire to see the, he has no desire to see our public lands privatized. However, um, he's, you know, one might argue kind of by name only. He's, he's Republican. I mean, he's not. He definitely hasn't demonstrated in any sense of being beholden to party orthodoxy. I mean, he's like, he takes it issue by issue, stance on things and doesn't really care for how things are done at the party level. However, his party is very much a, you know, they've, it's, it's right in there. It's one of the planks of their platform is right in their agenda to see us dump federal property to see us offload federal lands, to see us offload American public lands to, into, into state or private holdings.

Speaker 3:          00:30:06       So I don't know, I, I hope that he has good. I hope he has luck and resisting that if in fact, if in fact he is still standing by that statement that you made. I don't think most people in America understand how unique this situation is, that we have these massive swaths of public land. No, they don't, they, it's one of those things where, and even the people that do, even the people that know don't really conceptualize, like I grew up, um, I grew up about two and a half miles south of the southern terminus of manistee national forest in Michigan. Uh, a significant portion of our outdoor activities took place on that national forest. We took it like, it fell from, like, our perception of it was that it fell from the sky. It was that it just existed. Um, just had always existed, we took it for granted, like how you look at the sun and be like, the sun is just there, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:31:03       So I think that even people who are public lands users don't often don't take the time to be like, how is it that I'm able to be on this land, why I never considered it at all until I hung out with, you know, but I, but I'm saying I hung out on public lands and it wasn't for, it wasn't until I was, you know, it took me 25 years to start being like not home. It now what does this now, this public lands you speak of that you hold deed like the, as an American citizen at, in most ways as a global citizen because our national for our public lands are open to anyone American or not right? But as an American citizen, you hold deed to hundreds of millions of acres of land. Now there are conditions to your use like just things you can and cannot do, but you're free to roam camp, Hunt Fish, look at the stars, whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:31:55       You're extraordinarily wealthy. Um, and these things that came about, like they came out in various ways, it's probably the most influential person in creating the public land system we have now is Theodore Roosevelt, and he was controversial in his time for creating, are for helping to create our public land system. He had the same resistance when he was doing it from industry, from extractive industry. He had the same resistance that we have now to public lands and then went and chiseled his face on a mountain because everyone, like now everyone, every politician would like to liken himself to Roosevelt. Right, right. He's like one of those dudes and you can just be like, like Teddy Roosevelt. And people are like, yeah, positive feelings, positive feelings. He's achieved rushmore. This was a guy who was like a radical. You see a little bit of that with Reagan. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:32:47       During the Reagan administration during the time where he was actually president and massively polarizing figure. Yeah. People hated him. I mean, there was, there was so much going on during the Iran Contra hearings where it's like, oh my God, who is this asshole that we let run president? Yeah, I think around the time, like by the time he died he had to sort of ascended to political heaven. Yeah. Right. Now you can, like, Kennedy enjoys that position. I mean, Kennedy barely won the damn election. Yeah. It's, it's debated whether he actually won the, you know, people say it all these volts wound up in Lake Michigan. Well there's a lot of fucking shenanigans going on with that election with the Mafia. And that was a big part of how he got elected. So, but later in life, reluctant look back and say, now there is a guy. Right. And so roosevelt creating our national forest system. Um, yeah, he was considered a radical. Yeah. It was like this outlandish idea, like, you mean to tell me you're just going to take huge chunks of land. They could earn some individuals an extraordinary amount of money right now and just set it aside for just joe blow future person to enjoy. And he even made a point where he went on to say at one time that, that he was doing it for those in the womb of time. Whoa.

Speaker 3:          00:34:05       Because at the time people were arguing like, okay, if public land like, because here's the other thing we haven't that kind of pertains to this is wildlife in the Americas publicly owned. It's not like most countries is not like that. Like while leaving us is publicly owned, so a deer. If you've got a deer standing on your neighbor's place,

Speaker 3:          00:34:24       you as not a federal citizen citizen, but you as a citizen of your state owned that deer. That person can control access to it, but it's not as deer. He can prevent you from going up to it because you can't go on his land, but he has no more right to that deer than you do generally speaking. So when people said to Roosevelt like, how are you blocking industry out of all these lands and how are you blocking industry from getting at the the wildlife so we can sell the wildlife? Back when we had commercial hunting, he goes, if you're, if it's for the people, give it to us, and that's when he had his line. He's like, yeah, but it's for the, for those still in the womb of time. That's deep. That's deep. People didn't like them. I'm sure someone tried to do that today.

Speaker 3:          00:35:08       Dude. He had a thing one time where he had a timeline. He had to. He had to drop. There was a. There was an endo when he could. He kept just throwing shit into national forest for everyday. That guy was an office. I think he saved about something like 50,000 square miles of land or something, some sort of model and for everyday I could be wrong with that, but an absurd amount of land for everyday. He was an office and there's a thing he did call the midnight forest where he had a deadline that expired, like his ability to keep drawing up. Big Chunks of national forest was set to expire at a certain time on midnight and he was up

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       to last minute and midnight with a couple aides marking up maps making giant national forest and now we celebrate them all.

Speaker 1:          00:35:44       Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:35:45       Right. When they made. When they made yellowstone also national park, people were pissed. I'm sure mineral resources in their mental piss today. Timber in there. Yeah, but I'm saying all these big decisions like these decisions happen, did we create a public land system in America? Like the decision happens generally people look and go, wow, what foresight, you know, it's kind of this insane idea that you would have a country is prosperous as ours, you know, with our GMP, $350 million citizens, right? You'd have this. Like this thing is huge as us that would still have and intact suite of megafauna.

Speaker 2:          00:36:29       No one else pulls that off. So we've accomplished a lot. But then now and then people just get pissed because they want to be able to do stuff while they want. There's like interests that want to make money and when they want to make money and if someone tells him no, um, they get a little bit pissy and then the smart ones of them and I will know and I would never detract from their intelligence. The smart ones have them. Um, rather than walking away, they go like, well, how is this law? Why is the law this way and what can we do about it? And Right now, those folks, those folks have an idea that, that the solution to their problem is that we would begin undoing the great work of people like Roosevelt and Gifford Pincho and Aldo Leopold and all these, a seminal American figures that we would, we would undo their work and go back to a system where, um, where these landscapes are privatized

Speaker 1:          00:37:29       people who've never been to yellowstone. And I mean, even if you're not a hunter, you, you should go once a yellowstone anyway. Right? That's the point. Yeah, I have problem with that Dan Jordan, but it's, I, it's just forget about hunting, just the fact that we have this immense state park that you could go to. And I took my kids there this summer and uh, we hung out with Buffalo, were like standing there that there was a buffalo that was 100 yards away, which is looking at these giant, huge prehistoric animals. Yeah, it's a great place for introductory wildlife viewing. We have, we took a lot of selfies with elk because the elk, because the wolf population has increased in yellowstone, the elk have decided, look, there's one spot to hang out the fucking visitor center. Yeah. So you got by the visitor center. There's a coca cola machine, is a vending machine and a right next to the vending machine. There's a fucking elk just chilling, just laying down there. I mean they have zero fear of people and it's amazing how they become sort of acclimated, habituated, betray his work. It's funny when you look at,

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       there's a problem. I've identified it as much as I love yellowstone. It in my perspective that as a fellow that does what I do for food and, and, and, and enjoyment, which is to hunt A. I look at it from a grand wildlife thing and I look at it as a, it serves the purpose of being just like fantastic wildlife sanctuary, you know, and everyone, like, you know, our, our, our mutual friend Doug, during, um, even on his farm, right? He has established a, like a sanctuary area, like on his farm, a place where you don't go that it's always a spot where we're deer go and they don't get harassed in that area and it's like a self imposed sanctuary and so you have yellowstone provides that, but if identified this sorta thing, um, the idea I've been working on called Yellowstone Syndrome though is where people, Americans, some, so many of them, they're only id about wildlife and wildlife politics and wildlife management comes from the yellowstone story, that they wind up having a difficult time understanding wildlife and wildlife management in situations that are outside of a national park setting, which is to say they don't have a very good grasp on the inevitable conflicts that are going to arise between wildlife and society.

Speaker 2:          00:39:54       And that's a large chunk of ground where you just do not have those sorts of conflicts. Like what kind of conflicts we talking about. Oh, like for instance, a thing has been very difficult and very vexing for wildlife managers is what happens to a what, what happens to buffalo when they leave national? The yellowstone national park. I'm just, I mean, tobacco on the, on the yellowstone is she goes to get a sense for how revolutionary that idea was, you know, there was the Indian wars weren't even over when they made yellowstone. Yellowstone, you know, we were, we were still battling American Indians on the Great Plains when you also want it to affect, matter of fact, yellowstone was a park when the Nez perce were chased through by the US army and they actually killed a couple of terrorists in yellowstone bright at some of the buildings that are still there. Wow. Yeah. So you, you went to and got shot by Indians who were engaged in a war with the US army.

Speaker 2:          00:40:57       Wow. It was like a, it was, it was like they hadn't even, you know, the West hadn't even been in some ways that the center west hadn't even been settled and they were made and they made the national park and then Roosevelt went there and uh, you know, at the commemoration to like, it was, you know, went there to applaud it. So I just get a sense of like, I mean just it was just an outlandish idea, was so far ahead of its time, but with like the buffalo inch situation for instance, how it's kind of, how it sort of is like colored. The broader conversation would be a. You also is one of the few places where they've, where the animal buffalo or bison, you know, they're, they're lenay and name is bison. Bison. Some people say it's bison. Bison. Bison as opposed to bison.

Speaker 2:          00:41:46       Bison Atha backus at the baskets, but a buffalo, I call them Buffalo, ca. It's very controversial to calm. You're not cool if you call them buffalo, really know you're suppose to call them bison who you're hanging out with. Old timey folk. They use coyote. Yeah. Well, yeah. Well Kyle. So let's get to that in. Yeah, we'll, we'll call them both Dan Flores books. Oh you are good with that. Good. I'm going to call them bison. What the hell? So it's [inaudible] was one of the few places where bison have always existed. Now at a time, the ones there were fenced and fed, but they've always been there. And your then you have there is you have a genetically pure strain or there's been no cattle intro aggression into those animals. There's only a handful of herds in the US that were, there hasn't been some amount of cattle integration.

Speaker 2:          00:42:38       Um, you can't see it usually, but it's there. Oftentimes there's some New Mexico that don't. There's some of the Dakotas that do not in the yellowstone ones do not, they've never interbred or bending and interbred with cattle. So they're valuable in that way. And you know, at various times there's, you know, a few thousand of them in the park and the snow's pile up and one of the things they like to do when the snow piles up, so you'd like to leave the park and they'd go out at West Yellowstone, which is one of the primary entrance points into the, into the park. And they'll go out and, and the late at the gardener entrance in the late winter that were pro, that would be fine. Probably maybe be kind of fun if it weren't for a couple of issues. Uh, there's a, there's a livestock disease called brucellosis and it's a year age and disease. So it was a, it's a, it's a nine, eight, you know, we don't know everything of diseases as being native or non native, but it's a non native disease called Brucellosis and brucellosis causes cattle to it causes heifers, heifers, the kyle.

Speaker 2:          00:43:38       That's hasn't, you know, with just one young. So halfers a cow that said having her first going to have her first calf, it causes the heifers to abort their fetus. Now they've gotten brucellosis eradicated from cattle hurts. Generally when a state is getting brucellosis cases they have to pay for testing. Okay. So it's expensive to get all your cows tests, but if you have brucellosis in your state, the producers got to pay the testing to get them tested to make sure that not brucellosis positive. Well cattle long ago past brucellosis to the Bison on the Bison leave the park. They carry brucellosis with them and could reintroduce it into cattle herds though that hasn't. There's no known case of that happening. I don't have it spread. They well, uh, the primary way it spread his animals eat their own afterbirth and Lee after birth of other animals.

Speaker 2:          00:44:41       That's an interesting thing. Why the ether? You know, some folks he thrown. I proposed that to my wife. She was not down with it at all, but I've got friends that take their placenta. I got some buddies that had their wives placentas made into pills. Pills? Yeah. There's some gal that dries it up and puts it in capsules for you. I've heard of people cooking it with carrots. Yeah. I wanted to cook some man, but their thing is when my wife, uh, I swore up and down like I was going to drink the breast milk, you know, I've got a body to put breast milk in his coffee and everything. Man, you know, and do to nea and I couldn't go near. Does he wear a diaper to know? But he's like, he'll go if he's going to have coffee, you know, w when women are breastfeeding, they have little bottles in the fridge and everything.

Speaker 2:          00:45:20       Yeah. He just go in there, grab one of those, put it in his coffee and cheese. It's just drink it. I tried it just to taste, but I felt like I was stealing from my kid. I felt like I was being a cannibal, which is one thing that's my. That's where I draw a line. That's where you draw the line. Well, you ate a monkey. Yeah, I know and I felt horrible. Did you know? Yeah, I felt real bad. Well not so bad. I didn't eat it, but it was, it was. It was like emotionally complicated for me. But. So we'll get back to that. Yeah. The brucellosis deal. I'm trying to get. I'm trying to excel in yellow. I'm trying to explain like yellowstone syndrome. So the bruise, the lowest. The steel is a real issue for some people. So it conceivably a buffalo could leave yellowstone, give birth.

Speaker 2:          00:46:01       The afterbirth could be their cow, could eat that after birth can get blue brucellosis and like everything. And like everything we're talking about, this is so there's so many caveats and complications and things such as elk have brucellosis but outcome and go as they please. Right? So the minute a buffalo or bison, when he leaves Yellowstone National Park, if he walks into Montana now, it's not even fenced, right? It's like he doesn't know, but when he crosses the line, he goes from being a wild animal, from being native wildlife. Okay. To being livestock. So he goes from being the property of like under the administration of the National Park Service to the administration of Montana's Department of livestock. Wow. Native animal. Now she goes, how does that work though, if the native animal crosses over onto private property is the only. He's the only animal that happens too. So coyotes, Fox, Wolverines, grizzly bears, black bears, bighorn sheep, elk, mule deer, white tail deer, Moose.

Speaker 2:          00:47:07       They leave their wildlife. Buffalo leaves. He becomes errant livestock. Wow. Therefore, every year there's a, you know, there's a perennial story every year where a bunch of buffalo leave the park and get rounded up by the Department of livestock and sent to quarantine are usually sent off to slaughter. Yeah, they just killed a bunch of them. They killed like 2000 of them. Yeah man, they get, they get a lot of them. Um, you know, that plays cranks out a lot of animals too. So it's like they're always throwing out these humongous numbers of animals they've gotten in and every year you wind up having quite a few animals in the park. So, uh, but it's a thing now people point out this because elk have brucellosis in elk are calving in proximity to cattle and there and as far as we know that there's not like all your in class cases of cattle, of elk transmitting brucellosis to cattle.

Speaker 2:          00:48:00       People wonder like, well why are bison picked on? You know, why them. And one thing might be to say that we got, and this is generally true of wildlife in America, I think there was a brief period around 1900 when we had, you know, maybe about 75 of them left in the US. People got very used to their sort of like not being Buffalo Bison. And now this becoming like an a player again is the, the animals becoming a player again that we now have. We were down to 75. We've got 500,000 in the US now. Ninety four percent of them are privately owned, but we have a population of a half million buffalo in his country. Um, so. But we got really used to them not being around. And so it was this thing, it was like this additive thing. Like I think if there had been a long period when there were no elk.

Speaker 2:          00:48:51       And then all of a sudden someone said, hey, guess what? We're bringing these big ass ungulates back the eat tons of stuff. And they're huge and they might have a disease and we're just going to let tens of thousands of them cut loose across the landscape, have been up in arms, but they were used to it because elk are always on the ground. So that's why buffalo recovery has been so hard because it's kind, kinda like you're trying to sell people on this new thing, even though historically it's hardly new they've been around, but there's just, there was a period of, you know, century, not quite a century when it wasn't an issue. So it's really hard to get livestock interest and private land owners around these areas to unanimously get on board with the idea that we're gonna have animals roaming out of the park that are, has been proven to happen that will get into your corral and kill your horse or, you know, take out a school bus if it hits them or possibly transmit disease.

Speaker 2:          00:49:49       And the big thing that people don't really talk about but which is a huge issue is um, impact grazing rights, impact cattle, cattle grazing, get back to kill the horse. You had a gore that Gore stuff, they just go into the horse of stable and fuck them out. It's happened when they run, they run crazy. Yeah. They wrote in the summer and in the Bulls get very. They get real fired up and then, you know, the funny thing there too with, with the yellowstone ones, you're dealing with animals that are habituated, so it's only been like, you know, it's been 100 years that you can't. You haven't been able to hunt in the park. The animals have gotten habituated to humans. We like to look at yellowstone, think you're seeing something kind of natural, but you're actually seeing something pretty unnatural because that landscape was hunted for 12,000 years the last hundred years, not withstanding.

Speaker 5:          00:50:33       So the he wrote always hunted yellowstone. The unnatural thing is these animals are super comfortable. Being habituated to humans is unusual, but we go there and be like, this is what animals were like. I'm like, not if you draw a line back to when humans arrived in the new world. Well, that was one of the more fascinating things about Dan Flores on your podcast where he was talking about buffalo and that at one point in time the Indians or the native Americans when they had guns and they had horses, they were on their way to extra painting the buffalo on their own. Yeah. Before the market hunters came into place. That's an incredibly controversial idea. That was a. yeah, that was a controversial idea. Now is put for again, not I talk in my book that I wrote,

Speaker 2:          00:51:15       you know, I have a book of American Buffalo about, you know, the history of the animal and, and in my own personal experiences is hunting for the animal and finding a skull of one that I found that absorb a journey that led me down. But in working on that book, I spent a quiet time reading the work of Dan Flores and he was a mentor of mine in graduate school and he, and he wrote this a very interesting piece called Bison Ecology Bison diplomacy. And what he looked at was he was trying to find, was there a period when, um, when plains tribes. Okay, was there a period when native Americans had actually reached equilibrium with the bison herds and, and he argued that there was, not, that they had not achieved equilibrium, um, that even if that one of the, one of the points he makes many points this thing out, I don't want to sell.

Speaker 2:          00:52:06       This is pete short, it's a, it's a very large piece of scholarly work, but one of the things he talks about is just the introduction of the horse had humongous impacts on the animals on buffalo for a handful of reasons. Grazing competition. Okay. So enormous hort herds of wild horses and the horse was distributed. So you traced in flurries explains all of this as well. You can trace horses in to native American tribes on the Great Plains and elsewhere they go back to the Pueblo revolt. So you know, the Spanish can keep the doors last lot of their animals and the animals are traded up the east earned face and up the western face to the rockies. And then we're distributed all around. And so you're, when you get this idea in your head of a, of a, of a plains warrior right, mounted on horseback hunting for Buffalo, that was a very distinct phenomenon that didn't last nearly. It didn't last as long as the US has been a country like it did not last long between the introduction of the horse and the Indian wars

Speaker 2:          00:53:16       they want to. But like largely, you know, re removing free roaming, um, autonomous tribes off off the great plains. It just didn't last that long even though it became like the iconic image of the mountain plains hunter. And what he argues is the advent of the horse changed hunting practices. So much up until that point, you had tribes that were, were partially or largely agrarian coming out of the Mississippi River valley out of the Missouri River valley that would grow crops. And they would, during the summer when the buffalo herds were gathered into tremendous gatherings during the breeding season, they would do trips. They would do buffalo hunting trips. Once they had the horse. You had all these cultures turn into nomadic cultures that could have a troy and a horse and just follow the hurts and it was a tremendous amount of pressure put on these animals to support that amount where you had tribes migrating out onto the great plains and fighting over those resources and I think believe was one of his graduate students later looked at this piece where when Lewis and Clark did their big westward journey in the early 18 hundreds, the places where they talked about seeing the greatest amounts where they were just blown away by how many buffalo they're seeing.

Speaker 2:          00:54:34       We're generally fa fell upon sort of no man's lands areas between warring tribes. So the buffers of zone, the buffers of traditional hunting zones like where the blackfeet and the Su met up the edge habitat. There was where you had a lot of animals that weren't getting exploited by people. So you started to see these like regional extra patients of the animal and then firearms. What was another big blow where even outside of white hide hunters just showing up, but just those, those, those European technologies of horse gun. You were seeing a a steady depletion that would have not been in. It seems like the resource would not have lasted and you'd had the same outcome. What was interesting about his paper was that he was saying that the early settlers or the early explorers of the United States in the 15 and 16 hundreds, they didn't talk about Buffalo, so when the Spanish, the Spanish would go through places and they would.

Speaker 2:          00:55:34       They would name wildlife now like some of the Spanish came through, you know, they go through the entire Florida. Some of the first guys have stepped foot in Florida. They talked about everything they see right down to possums. Okay. They're not describing buffalo though. They're describing everything else. The English going there 200 years later and they're talking about buffalo. So there's sightings in what's now new orleans. Cabeza de Vaca ran into buffalo around what's now Houston. There's sightings of buffalo in what is now Washington DC. Simon Kenton and Daniel Boone figures like that were hunting them around the site of Nashville and Memphis. They were all way to the east coast. It seems there are only a handful of states that at some point in time didn't have any. My home state of Michigan doesn't seem like there were any for a long time. People thought that there had been buffalo in New York, but it turns out the the evidence for them and the paleontological and archeological record is two skulls.

Speaker 2:          00:56:35       Both the schools have cultural markings on them and it seems that they were the same way that that mean in in Joe here will like hunt an animal and bring the head home that they might've been just things someone had trophies that were traded or whatever because there's no other phone will remain from the animals in New York, but most places had them. Now the mound builders, so you have all these like mississippian culture is along the Mississippi River in Ohio. River valley is called the mountain boulders. They made these giant effigy mounds that people didn't even realize they were there until we had airplanes to get above and see the snakes and serpents and deer and all these creatures. They were building out our earth mounds that were so big that guys would like live around the mountain and never recognize it for what it was until they could look at it from above.

Speaker 2:          00:57:18       You can see these things with satellite imagery. They never built buffalo mounds, but once we emptied, and this is one argument, kind of a Tupac argument, once smallpox and other diseases carried off 90 percent of native Americans, 90. That's an estimate. Jesus. Many people say that. I mean that's I, I think it's a. I think like the scholar, the consensus is that it's, that it's in that ballpark. What are the numbers? Do they estimate the actual physical numbers? You know, I've seen it, but I don't know what it is. I think that there was a number that was floating around for awhile, 10 million, but I remember a lot of people criticize that number as being high. I don't know what the fashionable number is now, but 90 percent approximately why diseases diseases from the Europeans and that this was primarily responsible for this explosion in the population, the Buffalo.

Speaker 2:          00:58:10       So that's why when the Spanish would go into places, this is a theory now the Spanish, we're going to places first contact, like first peoples traipse through an area, they would go into places and they were described village after village, after village, after village. Okay. And they never talked about buffalo to English. While later they'll go down, someone guy, I'll go down the Mississippi river, he knows, see shit for people. But it was buffalo crawling everywhere. Wow. So, and another issue, another thing people talk about is changing agricultural practices that slash and burn agriculture was becoming a used and slash and burn agriculture was conducive to, to, to uh, spreading to. It wasn't conducive to buffalo because it created open spaces for them. That's another thing people look at is slash and burn agriculture. But either way it's proposed that the apex of that species was at the moment we found the fashionable number used to be $60 million. And that was, that was put forth by a guy named, you know, Dodge city, dodge city, Kansas. Got His name from a guy named Colonel Dodge,

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       Colonel Dodge. I could see, if you're interested, I could explain how he came up with it, but Colonel Dodge is the one that floated the idea that there were 60 million buffalo, now the fashionable number is, you know, 32 years, $32, million or 40 million and people say that that was that. That was an extraordinary amount of those animals and we witnessed it at its apex and that at other times in the history of the continent and other times with the natural history of our continent, there weren't nearly that many of the animals.

Speaker 1:          00:59:54       Fascinating concept and I never had heard it before. I'd only heard that there was a giant numbers of them and that the Europeans came over and Americans wiped them out because we wanted the skulls and the for [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          01:00:05       We wiped out the tail end of them. So if you get to like the end of the day, once you get to the end of the civil war, you know at that point there's maybe $15 million and that's when it was. It was in 18, 71 and 1872 that the, what you might call the commercial scale harvest of the animals happened and it happened in the south, what was called the southern herd around 1871, 18, 72 and the area surrounding dodge city where there's a large population of them and then it took 10 years by 18, 82. You couldn't find one. Wow. So the last big slaughter happened around mile city, Montana and it happened when the railroad, the railroad, made it to mile city. The northern Pacific made it to mile city and and provided a way to get hides the market and they did the last big kill there and killed about a million of them up there.

Speaker 3:          01:01:03       And then a year later Roosevelt came out to Madora North Dakota there thereabouts, hired a guide in scoured the countryside hunting through the carcasses of riding animals, trying to find one last one. Wow. So they could save him? No, he wanted to get one. It was his epiphany. He got to think about that guy. He kills one and does a war dance around it. What kind of dances that I don't know, I've always heard described as a war dance who didn't Holler and dancing around like a hunting show. Wow. So, but then whatever kind of effect it had on him, he then went and became the most influential conservation is we've ever had in this country. So it struck him somehow. But as a young man, yeah, he was like, man, I missed it. There's got to be one left. So you found one. He caught one, killed the Montana North Dakota border there and then.

Speaker 3:          01:02:04       And then went on to do all these kinds of amazing things. But that was, that was the, that was the big slaughter. What's cool about that? The time that worked out, his photography was just coming out. People were starting to have portable cameras and there's a photographer named La Hoffman had been sent out to miles city and he actually took a lot of images of those hide hunters working. The last big hurt, the last big shoot 'em. And then shortly after that there was some number animals left. And uh, and they lead a bunch of, uh, they a lot of bunch of plains Indians to, to leave one of the reservations and they went and did a little bit of a mop up. But yeah. Then shortly, uh, shortly thereafter there was a guy named Hornaday who was kind of writing letters around trying to find out who had one of these things laying around because they'd all fallen into private hands, you know, there's guys like buffalo hunters would kill them and they'd be like, Holy Shit, there's like none left.

Speaker 3:          01:02:55       And some of these guys actually went out and caught a couple. There was a guy named Buffalo Jones down in Texas that went out last, sold a couple calves, raised them on a cow's milk. And that's how, that's why we even have some now. Now it turns out no one knew this, but it turns out there was several hundred in Canada that no one knew about. Really? They didn't know about until much, much later. And how'd they get to Mexico? Oh, they probably always roamed in New Mexico. Now, the first buffalo the European ever laid eyes on was in Mexico, now Mexico City, but it was in, it was in, uh, who is the, who is the, the emperor there, you know, a Jamie. What was that dude's name? The, the Aztec leader in Mexico to notch to notch lawn was [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          01:03:45       I'm Kevin. What years? We're talking about know in the 15 hundreds. Cortez found one in Mexico City, but it was in a zoo. Montezuma? Try saying that. The city of topnotch salon. Oh, okay. So which is in which is now Mexico City. Uh, they had, he had one in a zoo. That was the first one described by European. Wow. But he was hundreds of miles away from their native range. They just had one, as he had all kinds. He had a menagerie. He had all kinds of animals that he collected from throughout their domains. So that was the first one described by European, but he didn't realize that the time that it was from far north of there, but they did stray down into the, into Sonora. And they strayed well of all the way up. You know, still today we have by great slave lake, you know, the extent well up into Canada, so there was a number of them, some people call them wood buffalo, some people accept the idea that there's subspecies by last time about bison.

Speaker 3:          01:04:45       Bison, Athabaskan, Bison, Bison, Bison Plains Bison would bison. There's morphological differences. They look different. They're in the boreal forest. There were hundreds that we didn't know about and know some of those populations are still in now in Canada. So we have, you know, like, like, like in all things with Americans, we have an American centric view of everything. We have an American centric view of wildlife where we'll say there's only 75 left and I feel like our Canadian neighbors are oftentimes being like, you know what, we didn't quite handle it quite as badly as you folks did. So yeah, it was a, you know, it's a long, bizarre picture. I can't remember what the hell we get even got us on the subject. Uh, Dan Flores, uh, I don't remember either. Public lands, Yellowstone Syndrome, yellowstone brucellosis. Yeah. So there's a tremendous background in the buffalo story. Has we just explored and

Speaker 3:          01:05:43       w, W, W if you follow wildlife politics, it's a conversation happening in places like Alaska, which is a whole other long story, but how it's happening there, it's happening in Alaska, is happening in Montana. It's having a Wyoming is happening in the DAKOTAS. Um, which would be. Do we welcome, are we going to welcome this animal back onto the landscape as a free roaming wild animal? Like all of our other. Earlier I mentioned how this country, we have an intact suite of megafauna like we haven't lost. We might have damn few of some things. We haven't lost any of our large mammals. It's kind of mind boggling during the colonial period. Uh, western Europe, I think last five or six species of large mammals.

Speaker 3:          01:06:35       The oryx many things we've, we haven't, we haven't lost any large mammals. We came pretty close though, right? Damn calls with the buffalo in particular. Yeah. And we lost. We've lost birds. We lost the passenger pigeon and we lost the ivory billed woodpecker. And you know, we lost many things of many kinds of. Many. Not many, but we've lost substantial numbers of things we haven't lost any large mammal. Extinction is terrifying for us. Right. That's one expression that a extinction man made. Extinction. Yeah. That's terrifying for me. To me it's a, um, it's a moral sin that just is like, you know, we have all these conversations in bioethics and other things about playing God. I think that extinction like human cause extinction is a, it's terrifying.

Speaker 1:          01:07:18       Do you support if there is evidence of human products to human caused extinction, if there is the opportunity to bring something back through scientific methods through like some sort of cloning. Do you support that or you think it's gone, it's gone, it's gone,

Speaker 3:          01:07:30       man. I'm on the fence about it and in my understanding of the, my understanding of the technology is probably too limited for me to really speak to it with any authority but it. But the most interesting aspect of that is when you get into the Pleistocene extinctions where you notice it just just to kind of bring people up to speed on what that means. If you just look globally at where we lost that, where we lost were in when we lost package terms, so elephants including the woolly mammoth, mastodon and in our own on our own continent. If you look around like where are we last packet terms, we always lose pack derms. I'm right around the time show up, know, like we lost, we lost them, you know, humans arrived in the new world. It's a hotly debated number. 14, 15,000 years ago. And I'm kind of contemporaneous with the extinction of woolly mammoths and we know that to some degree humans were preying on wooly mammoths and mastodons.

Speaker 3:          01:08:36       There's context of, of hunting equipment in context with, with wooly, mammoth remains. There's butchering sites, there's all kinds of stuff. And they vanished right around then, um, yet we didn't reach an island out in the Bering Sea till 4,000 years ago and there was a woolly mammoth on that island till 4,000 years ago. And then dudes show up. It's gone. So some people will look, there's a thing called the blitzkrieg hypothesis, which hold that all these large mammals though, nine general of large mammals that went extinct when humans arrived in the new world that they were somehow human caused extinctions. Not other people argue that it was, you know, other things,

Speaker 1:          01:09:14       climate change issues. Randall Carlson is a guy who I've had on my podcast before and he argues that it's due to asteroidal impacts. Yeah. I hung out with a guy who's doing research on that and there's a lot of evidence of evidence. This guy was looking for nano diamonds. Guy Found namel domain or diamonds, I think you say it's called Triton night, but it's nuclear glass. It's the same exact glass that they get on sand when they have nuclear explosions. When they do test sites, they find that all throughout Europe and it's all around 12,000 years and there's also more, somewhere around 10,000. So it seems like somewhere between 12,000 and then another thousand years or so later there was another series of impacts. And it has to do with this, uh, asteroid belt that we pass through. And it was fucking fascinating but terrifying conversation with.

Speaker 3:          01:10:00       I went with a guy that, there's a, there's a famous, uh, Paleoindian site, north of Denver called the Linden Meyer site and the Linda Meyer site was one of the few, not one of the only place that we now know were large gatherings of the, of the folsom culture, a large gatherings of the folsom culture where you had perhaps hundreds of folsom hunters in one place at one time and the site is marked by a larger, like a, like an easily recognizable escarpment. And it's, it's presumed that it was just a place that you could describe and people could meet up. But that's the, the Linden Meyer site has been studied extensively in tons of radiocarbon dating has happened at Linden Meyer site. And I was with a guy there who was looking, who is working on that theory. Then you know, the theory with the, the asteroid impact and the nano diamonds, because he was able to go draw samples from strata that had been tested and studied so much, which is an expensive laborious process to get datelines, you know, when he was there, drawn those things out. And then I had other people who, who worked professionally in this space talking about how um, because sorta ridiculing idea

Speaker 2:          01:11:13       and saying that it's just like one of these ideas that never dies and I'm never quite lives but never quite dies. And, and uh, but when you look at it, it's just so hard to believe that they hunted them to extinction so quickly. Well, the many things, 65 percent of all the North American mammals died really quickly and it wasn't just big stuff. Yeah. The thing is like we use it because when we used to do digs, right, they used to do like archeological digs, you know, they would use high pressure hoses and shit. And they were, they only had an. They're only looking at the big stuff, but many, many things went extinct. Did you see that bird species? Small species, you know, it's, it's Kinda hard to picture it. It's just so hard to picture what exactly happened. It's just, I don't know, especially in people killing them with adult adults.

Speaker 2:          01:12:01       Yeah. Those goofy things. Which I mean, how far can you throw an Atlatl, uh, that people kill stuff? Forty yards. I think that's a real phrase. It'd be like the hulk, but then the thing they say is, you know, we talked about wildlife in yellowstone being habituated. That wildlife probably would have been the other extreme. They probably would have been like, uh, the elk in yellowstone wolves showed up. Was it like, Whoa, what's that cute dog? Right. So, and then they have very low fecundity, you know, pack in terms of we're not just talking about, that's a problem. We're just talking about packing or you're talking about like a short faced bears, the American Cheetah, giant ground sloths on and on and on and on and on to these guys really hunted to extinction. It's hard to imagine but it's also hard to imagine all that shit going to extinct for any cause. Well its also coincides with the end of the ice age, so something happened. Something radical at the end of the ice age is just an idea that we've created, right? Like we did during. There were interglacial periods, like if you look at the ice ages are or the pleistocene, right? There were interglacial periods where the water was much higher than it is now. There were interglacial periods when the water would have been up over the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty Really? And then shit froze again as like. But the idea that the pleistocene holocene transition is just like a.

Speaker 2:          01:13:24       it's just a point we divided in our heads, you know, we had, there was many glaciations right? Time will only tell if we ever see another glaciation again, but I don't know. And that's one of the things that, that's one of the things that makes that emboldens people who contradict. One of the things that emboldens people who contradict human caused climate change is that we've been through so many cycles, they'll often point out and say, well, how do we know this isn't just a normal, another warming trend between ice age periods and then a lot of people pointed out and go because there's no evidence that they ever happened this quickly. This is like radically fast. These are things that played out over 10,000 years. These aren't things that played out over human lifetimes. You know, an interglacial period being a 10,000 year thing. Interestingly, interglacial periods are really important to understanding all these issues because interglacial periods in glacial periods, mark moments when wildlife could have come into the new world when wildlife such as you know, buffalo and then later elk and other things when they would have had the opportunity to come from Asia and crossed the bering land bridge and come down and do our to our continent and when it would have, when they could have not done that.

Speaker 2:          01:14:41       So when you look at like when did humans show up? When did these other things show up? Like when did the horses disappeared? When could they have come down? One [inaudible] buffalo come down. How did elk get here? You're sort of always looking at assuming they didn't come down when the entire north of swerved and 40 feet of snow and ice, presuming they came down when it was the icefree corridor and so you can kind of fine tune all these comings and goings, but looking at moments when there was an ice record or to come down and so if it's beautifully intertwined, man,

Speaker 1:          01:15:10       it's so complex and there's no way to really lock it down yet has no way to really. Totally figured it out yet. But it's so fascinating when they find these animals still. They just pulled a big giant skull with tusks out of a ranch in Montana. Like really recently. I think I tweeted it, I think it was c, see if you could find it on

Speaker 2:          01:15:29       my body. Found a jaw with the maulers in it, but

Speaker 1:          01:15:33       to museum. Wow. He just found a couple of years ago he found it in the tone. My friend John, his buddy owns a ranch in Montana and he was talking to some. This might be the same guy. Do you know where it was? No, I don't know, but this was. I'm talking about the tusks. Oh, nevermind. Okay. They, they, they found a dinosaur on his property. Said the, uh, archaeologists came. What was it? A paleontologist? Paleontologist paleontologist came to his property. He said he went for a walk up the hill. He stopped. He found something on the ground. He looked around, he made some calculations and it came back to him. He goes, congratulations. You got a dinosaur on your property. He was what? They came back. They have a fucking t-rex on his property. No one guy got a million and a half dollars because they pulled a fucking t-rex from his property for the paleontologist, found it, and literally founded in five minutes, said he started walking around the property. He found a tooth or some sort of chip, a piece of bone. He recognized it immediately as being dinosaur. Made some phone calls, called some people and next thing you know, like within weeks they had started excavations. No shit found a fucking t rex and I was prepping cars because it was on private land. You could sell it a million and a half dollars on

Speaker 2:          01:16:43       public land Foa. Once something's fossilized, you can't touch it. Yeah, that's interesting. But do I agree? Cause I don't want to escape your question about undoing human caused extinctions. What else getting at is the animals that I'm most interested in just from a boy in a very boyish way. Are those pleistocene creditors. Um, and if I knew, you know, if I had the diamond and bullet right there would tell me that. Yes, absolutely. We lost the mammoth because of human hunting behaviors at the pleistocene holocene transition. I will be like, let's bring them sons of bitches back right now. Wow. If you could prove without a shadow of a doubt that human hunters created that problem. Yeah. And I knew the tech, like, let's say the technology was just fail safe. You want to talk about some controversial. You think people are up in arms about some buffalo hunting around you cut loose them short faced bears or you know, that would be a giant issue.

Speaker 2:          01:17:47       Yeah. You think the wolf reintroduction when she was shaky? The short face bear, the scary guy. They have animal. That's a huge bear very fast. Really? Yeah. Yeah. They, they were, they were a fast runner and they're bigger than polar bears. And you know, there's a, the American Cheetah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the reason why antelope are so fast. That's a theory that the antelope are ridiculously fast for any predator. There's like, there's speed doesn't make sense through the context of what's chasing them right now. Why do people call them speed goats while they haul. But why goat? Because. Because there I think there's a, there's a, there's a dumb ass reason and there's a tax nonvocal reason and I know dear friends of mine on both sides of that spectrum where I'm fast, if I put it to my brother who on occasion calls him goats, he'll talk about how taxonomically there, uh, you know, they're distinct.

Speaker 2:          01:18:43       Like they're the only thing in there. They're the only thing in their family, right? Um, they don't have any close relatives, but there, there, there are only there a horned animal that sheds its horns and antlers shed elk, Moose, deer. All the servants like antler shed horns don't shed. Animals carry their horns for their whole life. Like a Kraton a sheath. But antelope shed their horn. But it turns out that some people like to point out that they're like a close to a goat. The goat is close. Other people say just because they kind of looked like goats. I don't know. I think it's a derogatory term. I don't like it really. I don't like derogatory animal terms. The why is goat a derogatory tone? Well, go is what people call the greatest of all time. It's the goat. Now a mountain goat is a noble, majestic animal, right?

Speaker 2:          01:19:30       A barnyard go. I don't think it's noble and Majesta. Okay. And I don't think they're equating it to a mountain goat, right? The mountain go. Being as beautiful white, fluffy goats will be in a wild animal. Those are awesome. Yeah. It's a wild animal. And to be like a speed go, you're saying like, oh, it's like a goat, a lowly barnyard. Go that hauls ass. I was just in his act. I feel that this derogatory. This is a minor issue. I'll point out. But it does bother me. I don't think it's derogatory to call it a go. But I do think that. And I haven't met whatever it does. I haven't met anyone who does think it's derogatory. But it's so funny because mountain goat, you agree as a noble animal. I don't want to you. I was in Hawaiian culture everywhere. Bizarre. Driving down the road.

Speaker 2:          01:20:10       It's fucking goats everywhere. Which just wild goats. And they're like, they're like a wild animal. Yeah man. You already talked about wildlife politics. Hawaii. Hm? Do you ever want to get into that? Yeah, it's crazy. That's interesting shit. Where you have your whole suite of mammals is, uh, your whole suite of mammals is all non native. Yeah, all of them. But here's the, here's where it's interesting. So polynesians colonize the Hawaiian islands, like the first people, the first humans to colonize the Hawaiian islands. Polynesians who carried with them rats. Dogs, pigs, right. We have native Hawaiians, right? Like Hawaiians and indigenous Hawaiians. People are carrying native rights. They regard themselves as native Hawaiians. Yet people are always telling them that the wildlife is non native, so you get people that showed up with pigs and now the nature conservancy will get chunks of land in Hawaii and eradicate the non natives and the native Hawaiians be like, but were contemporaneous with these animals.

Speaker 2:          01:21:15       How am I native? Right, but you're telling me that the thing I like to hunt is not native. It needs to be gotten rid of. It's ridiculous. They should think it is. Well, I don't mean to say they like. It's a unanimously held viewpoint, but people who hold the viewpoint of that, they that they hunt pigs, their father hunt pigs, their grandfather hump pigs. They're great. Great, great, great. Great grandfather, hundred pigs. Now what's the pressure coming from to eradicate them from agriculture? No, it's from people who who are worried about losing yet more and we've already lost, doesn't know. Speaking regional extinctions are extra patients and in some cases extinction extinction. We've lost dozens of species of, of Hawaiian Flora and fauna to considering a wide range of ground nesting birds have been lost to rats and pigs. So now it's not so much focused on the animals but, but flora, so there are people who are trying to read who would like to, and then I get where they're coming from, who would like to restore, um, large areas of, of native plant communities in the Hawaiian islands because anything, when you go there, all the fruit you see the coconuts are not native papayas, mangoes, breadfruit, none of that stuff's native.

Speaker 2:          01:22:33       Wow. It's all introduced. It's a p that places a petri dish, man. They got their turkeys, pheasants, chucker, they're hunting access and everything there. But none of that shit's from there. So there are some people who look and they say like, we have, uh, we have, uh, you know, ecological responsibility to try to salvage some part of this. But meanwhile, another perspective would be like, we made this place bloom, this place oozes with life. And there's people who, you know, they get all their, they're able to glean all of their

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       food sources from the island, from things that their ancestors have established on the island, and it's offensive to them. Do you know about Darwin visiting the Galapagos silence and that it's one of the ways that he sort of formulated his theories about evolution and all the various variety of wildlife, uh, through visiting the Galapagos islands unintentionally. People have had seeds that they brought with them on the bottom of their shoes. Oh, I'm sure. Which is really crazy. And all these animals and plants are either are growing that are non native and this debate pops up as to what to do with them. And then there's all these turtles that live there and there's this debate props up as to like how to protect these turtles. And they brought in goats to eradicate some of the, some of the plants now. And there's some people brought goats over there, like some sailors, brock goats over there as a food source and left them on the island figuring, hey, we'll stop back when we need food.

Speaker 5:          01:24:04       And now they've got goat problems, so they're trying to figure out how to eradicate the goats. And you know, the Judas, Judas goat. That's good. Well they take one goat and they, uh, they sterilize that goat and so that goat can't breed, but that goat will find all the other goats and hang out with that goat and they put a radio collar on the little fucker and then he lets them know where the other goats are and then they gunned down those goats and he goes, well, I to go find some other goats. And he goes and finds the other one. And they're like, oh, we found him. And the thing is the poor guy, I don't even know if he's like, he's like, man, am I lucky they show up in his helicopter that, that, that may have taken them out like platoon style. Yo, the writer, Tom Robbins, um, is he still alive? Skinny legs and all. I think he jitterbug perfume. Yeah, I think he's alive. You know, he was talking about. And one of his books, he talks about Hawaii, how Hawaii had a rat problem. Then they brought in the mongoose and they had a mongoose problem and he makes the joke that we had a crime problem and we brought in cops.

Speaker 5:          01:25:12       Well that's sort of what Australia did. Australia brought in Fox to deal with the rabbits. They brought in rabbits. The rabbits got out of control. They brought in Fox and deal with the rabbits, the Fox already in ground nesting birds. And they brought in cats as well. They have a huge feral cat problem in Australia to the point where they're hunting magazines are really bizarre because holding up cats like what? Like my friend Adam Green tree lives in Australia and you know, it's, it's a crazy place because it's similar in a lot of ways that Hawaii is, that a lot of the animals they or not native, but they're hunting magazines are filled with fucking dogs and cats and shit. It's just weird to literally shaken up Mary if you left one of those on an airplane. So the next passenger to find while I was on an airplane and uh, I got to the part where the guy was holding up the cat grip and grin and I just turned the page real quick. Come

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       on. Fucking Jesus is heavy.

Speaker 3:          01:26:07       Yeah. The non native thing is, uh, it, it amazes me. Our inability to anticipate, or I guess it's Kang. I'm going to say something. It's like weirdly contradictory, our inability to anticipate unintended consequences, which doesn't entirely make sense, but you see what I'm getting at. Right, right. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:26:28       Well there's no forethought to bring in boxes or cats like and say, well they're just gonna eat the rabbit that we left behind. Yeah. Yeah. Had Your fucking mind. They're gonna eat everything. I kid you not see that coming. Don't you know what a cat does? No. That's killed things. You can't even throw a ball of yarn in front of a fucking.

Speaker 3:          01:26:45       Yeah. I mean, it Kinda doesn't end like we're doing. We're doing it now. Something we just don't. We won't know yet. In 10 years we'll be there 20 years. We'll be goofing on. Something we're doing right now that we think is a good idea probably, right? Yeah. Well we like. Can you believe those dumb asses? Yeah. In 2016 thought x, I have some theories about what those things might be, but I mean, you know, we're not done

Speaker 1:          01:27:11       well. Commercial sales, commercial, large scale agriculture in a way is not only just really, really recent. It's completely unnatural to have these giant swaths of land. It's filled with corn. Yeah. Like monoculture stuff's very unnatural. So people that think about like, oh, I'm, you know, I'm eating vegetables, I'm eating natural and I'm not a part of this whole factory farm system. What the fuck? You're not. You're a part of factory agriculture system. If you're eating corn, if you're buying corn, you're eating corn on the cob thinking you're all healthy. That shit is coming from a really unnatural place. It's coming from this ground that has been filled up with all this nitrogen that's been sucked out of the air through the harbor method. They've, they've dumped it into the earth because the earth earth's been depleted with minerals to the point where they're no longer supports growth of plants unless you add stuff to it and then you have these large scale machines that they need to attend to this stuff. And there's nothing natural about large scale agriculture. No, we just don't consider it because we consider factory farming when it comes to living animals as being horrific, you know, whether it's pigs or cows or chickens, that disturbs almost anybody with a conscience, but we don't think twice about the consequences of large scale agriculture on actual wildlife and wild

Speaker 3:          01:28:27       when you picture that we have, I mean much vaster than this, but we have entire counties that support a single species of plant of plant. Oftentimes a single species of a non native plant. Corn. Corn is. It's kind of a native, you know, it's derived from maze. It's like kind of a native species. So oftentimes it's like entire county's given over to a single non native plant.

Speaker 1:          01:28:56       Well isn't corn sort of like looking at a domestic dog and saying, well that domestic dog as

Speaker 3:          01:29:01       a wild animal? Yeah, I really, I, I don't even know, like if you took someone from pre-colombian times and showed them a corn cob, I don't know that they, they, I don't think that they would probably recognize that. You wouldn't know what the fuck that was. They were dealing with a corn that was more. It was. That was a smaller than when you are making a stir fry and get the little baby corn things, whether that's small, small, little things. Yeah. Wow. They can't even tell like they can't tell how it even came to be. Some people have a theory that it was bred from a grass. It's like they're like the lineage of corn is hard to track. Wow. So was this native Americans that did this where they figured out how to splice these plants together and tie. There's a book, I can't remember the name of the book that gets into it, but just trying to like track down sort of the history of corn and how it came to be.

Speaker 3:          01:29:51       You know, the oftentimes points you would domestication of animals and plants. Sometimes it was sort of an accidental domestication, you know, like you'd go out and gather something, right, and you bring it home, you process it near your home, you're scattering seed, right? And eventually you're like creating these things. But yeah, corns, difficult to track the lineage of corn is not clear. It's just so bizarre what kind of a foothold it has an American culture to everything, man. It's, everything's crazy. I recently interviewed for a documentary project we're working on. I interviewed a animal he's at, he's from California. He's an animal rights activist and a, he's a, he teaches animal ethics and um, he has a brand of veganism that I think it would be refreshing to. You should have this guy. I keep telling him you should have on your show. But, uh, he has a barrier. What's his name? His name's Robert Jones. He has a very, uh, refreshing sort of veganism. I'd had this dude over dinner. Really? Yeah. But, but, but he, he doesn't, he doesn't hold out ideas that he's peer

Speaker 3:          01:30:54       because of what we're talking about right. Like he's, he's educated enough about agriculture and educated enough about the inherent struggle, the inherent life and death through all food production did. He doesn't think like, oh, I have all the answers. I am the gentle kind one because he's seen cornfields like he knows like you're churning your violently churning the land with the equipment. Things are dying when you grow vegetables like we're in, we're in meshed in a in a cycle of life and death. That is inescapable. His point, we're not on. I don't want to totally steal the guy's pointing. He'd do a better job explain himself, but his point is that if we agree that we should minimize suffering, right? There are steps we can take to minimize suffering. Not Saying that I've got it. Answer is no, I've got it figured out, but if we want to minimize the suffering of sentient beings, then that's a conversation we should have.

Speaker 3:          01:31:54       The best thing that he said, the best thing that he said in explaining the animal rights movement, which I've always been a little bit baffled by, is he gets into this idea of he uses the term speciesism. Yeah. I've heard that one. Yeah. So you know, we had, we've dealt with and deal with racism we've dealt with and deal with sexism and we are, he would argue, I think he would say we're on the cusp of, of tackling our problem with speciesism and he would say like if you went to someone like, you know, if you went to the Mississippi Delta, you know, in the, in the 17 and late 17 hundreds and said to someone like, Hey, you know, have you ever thought about the fact that uh, you know, you kind of like own and abuse these people. Have you ever thought about how they're like people too, you know, they're like you and me.

Speaker 3:          01:32:50       He was, he was saying like, the guy wouldn't be able to cope with what you were saying. He'd be like, oh, clearly. I mean, come on, any idiot could tell you that that slave is not. I mean, come on. Right, right. He says, that's where we're at right now with animals. Like when I say it to you, you're like, well, clearly we're so. Does he aim to stop animal on animal crime? You know, I asked him about that and um, that was one of the things that I, at the end of our conversation, I even said to him, I'm like, you got a couple of things you need to work on because he didn't have a great one for that. Another one that he didn't have a great one for his. He had nothing to, not that he ended a great one now that I was like trying to stump him because he's, he's, he's a very intelligent, well thought person and very respectful to people that you talking.

Speaker 3:          01:33:42       Do even people that disagree with them. I have nothing but admiration for the guy. But we had a, a conversation that, that I, that I was not totally satisfied with where he has a deal of reverence it seems. And again, at the risk of putting words in his mouth, he has a reverence for like indigenous hunting cultures, right? That they had like this sort of respect. They had a respect for animals that we don't have and somehow that made it okay for them. Like they had a spiritual connection. And so that made that okay. And we don't have that, so we're not okay. And I asked them about are you able to identify the point in human development and cultural development? What is the point when you're supposed to give up the chase? Like at what point do you have a responsibility to stop hunting because you're saying that it is okay. For some people it's absolutely not okay for us now when should we have made the jump? Because earlier Tom Bout like the Spanish, there's a. there's a situation where the Spanish had gone into in the American southwest and we're trying to, as they called it civilize southwestern tribes and they were building homes for them, trying to instruct them in religion, trying to create schools for them, trying to provide them with

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       the tools of the agrarian lifestyle. And they would write letters back to the king complaining about how these people refuse to stop, go hunting. Like you give them a chance and he sons of bitches take off to go hunt and here we are giving them everything they need to be sedentary and they just won't get with the program. So there is this struggle where people were like, you're supposed to be like, I think some people expect you, like if you're a human, they think that the end result of humanness is that you like wind up not hunting, that it's sort of the goal of civilizations to make you not a hunter. And I think he's a little bit guilty of that because he thinks it is okay for some people and where he runs into trouble. As he talks about that. I asked him about ethics.

Speaker 2:          01:35:48       He says, but the animal doesn't care about your ethics to him. He's dying. If he dies and you have a good feeling in your heart or if he dies and you have a bad feeling in your heart, he's dead. It doesn't matter. They don't know what trip you're on your car. They suffer the same regardless of your motivations. And which leads me to want to point out, okay, but the indigenous cultures that you say, it's okay for them to hunt. Their animals are suffering to the animals they killed. Don't know that they're being killed by indigenous peoples and therefore it makes the suffering more palatable for them. They're dying. So there are some traps there that, that, that to me were answered in a satisfactory way. Does any of that make sense?

Speaker 1:          01:36:29       Yeah, absolutely. It's a very messy situation if you want to try to confine behavior that way and you want to impart moral judgment on people because what do you do with people with pets? We do it. People that have cats. I mean he has, he has companion animals. He has some very good. He has good stuff to say about that. Yeah, it was very interesting. So saved. What does you have to say with those animals that are mistreated and confined and ground up in the food? He wouldn't like that, but I, I don't know if you feel. I, I would imagine, um, I feel, I feel kind of like you can feed your cats, have a vegan diet and I would imagine in my act about it because I got into it because I found out I got, I got harassed by someone online and I went to their twitter page and it said Hashtag Vegan cat and I went, you gotta be fucking kidding me. And then I found this entire community of people that feed their cats vegan food. The problem is the cats go blind. They die

Speaker 2:          01:37:19       like that. He didn't, he wasn't that interested in an argument. And when I was saying to him like, would you, do you feel that we should separate predatory animals from pray and put them on like a soy diet? And he just thought I'll. And I don't understand why he felt that was being like ridiculous for the sake.

Speaker 1:          01:37:35       Well it is, but how you're going to see those stats. It's a real quick question. I mean, why you, you're, you're, you're taking this cat and you're putting this cat above the animals that it eats. Your deciding that these chickens and the fish and all the different things that you need to grind up to make cat food. That's okay because you love this cat. You have a hierarchy of animal life and we all have a hierarchy of life. Vegans. I've seen

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       vegans slap mosquitoes. I've seen it. I've seen that. I've seen them kill ants. You know, there was a lady I used to live near [inaudible]. The lady that ran the Ashram was spraying bug spray with the from. It's a Buddhist temple. It's okay. And she was still live in a house next to it. Oh, next door to it, sorry. Um, and um, she used to spray bug spray on the ants and I was like, what the fuck you on the ant on the answer to kill the ants. She was killing him and I go, what are you doing? She's like, well, we don't like to. But they get into our food and like, Holy Shit, like you're a vegetarian who's committed to a Buddhist life of do no harm, but yet you're, there's no way around this. You have to poison these fucking ends with death from the sky that comes out of these containers. These metal containers is aerosol containers of death. This is, but this is a bizarre lines that we draw, but as long as I am putting my, uh, taken the liberty of putting myself in Robert and Joe and Wethis is Robert Jones, his position, I think that he would have some interesting stuff to say about, about this conversation we're having when we're like, because some harm happens.

Speaker 5:          01:39:08       Then let's just say fuck it, and we'll open up the gates. Well, no, but let's talk about life. Is his life in a small form more insignificant or less significant than an elk? Like, who decides that an ant is less significant than an hour? If I shoot one elk, I can eat it for a year. That's one life, one life for a year. You don't like ants getting on your peanut butter and Jelly Sandwich. So you spray a whole colony of these fuckers. You've killed thousands of life forces. And even ruling out the insect thing. I've ever, uh, a guy that wrote a, a pretty scathing review. I think he might've been, it might've been. I came, remember it was in the Wall Street Journal or somewhere you, this guy wrote a pretty scathing review of my third book and, and there is like just the number of animals this guy has killed about me.

Speaker 5:          01:39:58       Right. I remember thinking if you go and get a 12 pack of mcnuggets, how many chickens, how you sorted out the parts, you're probably eating hundreds of chickens probably. Yeah. There's, it's all scraps. It's emulsified. Scrap. Yeah. They're not like, okay, we're going to take this chicken here and we're going to produce 30 nuggets. Well, my problem is they never turned that force on themselves. They never turned that high powered vision of, you know, the consequences of their actions on themselves. If someone's talking about like, if this guy is a Vegan and he's a vegetarian and he's talking about how many animals you've killed, how many animals are you responsible for, for your fucking, your whole wheat. He wasn't even, he wasn't he. He was. So he was a mediator. Well, that's preposterous. That's Ricky Gervais'. It's Ricky Gervais' constantly talks hunters

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       and hunting the guy who eats meat, like there's so many weird laws and I, I get it that he doesn't think people should hunt animals just for trophies. And I agree, but it's very rarely do these animals get hunted just for trophies. Like can you, if you shoot a fucking elephant, the village eats the elephant when you're feeding hundreds of people with that elephant.

Speaker 3:          01:41:16       And I'll point out too, and I do all the time pro elephant shooting. It's illegal. No, I, I like, we're going to talk about yellowstone syndrome. I almost, I'm almost having a personal. I'm, I'm almost, I'm taking a couple year long break from discussing wildlife in Africa. Really just black

Speaker 1:          01:41:36       now. The your article that you wrote was one of my favorite on that subject and it was right around the time that the Cecil, the lion thing was going down and it also referenced that Kendall Jones girl who uh, got a lot of hate online because she had, she was a Texas cheerleader and she was really cute and I think

Speaker 3:          01:41:53       yeah, people hate a good looking woman hunting in Africa. Big Smile on her face and do not. They do not like some dude, like did a real good and heating and cooling and like my hands aren't going to go a lot. People are like, yeah, that's fucking cool. Hot Girls. Hot American girls don't go there. Well, and it's also like, what are you shooting? If you're over there and you're shooting a Kudu and you're going to eat it and you know, you feed the villages every as well. It is an antelope that's okay. This is traditional. Something that we owe. We're going to talk about the hierarchy because we spent a lot of time at work work when we're out filming mediator. We spent a lot of time talking about the hierarchy because for instance, we have a camera guy who worked with Rick Smith, has a long professional history and working with wildlife, filming wildlife and uh, didn't grow up hunting.

Speaker 3:          01:42:40       Um, he, he, he, he, he's coming around, he's curious about it, but he asked a lot of good questions and we were looking. We had killed a Moose and um, the next day it happened. We were up in, uh, in Alaska. We killed a moose in the next day. We rolled our camp and having to go near there and there was a wolverine dragging off Moose parts when you talked about this on your podcast. Yeah, it's great story. Rick was like, and you're allowed in that area between September one and March 31st you're allowed to kill your lot. Oh, Wolverine. Um, and my friend bought boat and you know, he, he has eaten and enjoys wolverine meat and the hides, as we all know what phenomenal the height. I don't think we all know that well, digital listening to this, like we all know traditionally parkers are trimmed with Wolverine because Wolverine will not freeze up when Scott Frost on it by trim, demean the, around the hood, around the hood.

Speaker 3:          01:43:35       When your exhale and you're. Yeah, stuff gets fraud. Will Ring. Doesn't frost up. Wow. So is that going to be used? I don't know. I don't know why it was a hollow hair, but I don't know what it is about it that it resists. This fraud resists for us. So anyways, we're kicking around. I'll, I'll, I'll tell the end. First day we didn't shoot the bull ring but we were just about, you know, we legally could have gone and take a crack at it. Did you have an opportunity to do so? Yeah, we would have had to have acted quickly, but yes. Or You could have staked it out and just waited for him to come back because he wanted to. He's a little thief. He's stealing your Moose, but we already butchered it. Right. He was taking the hooves. Oh, okay. Guts. Right. But you're a leader, so he's taken bone.

Speaker 3:          01:44:13       He actually stole two our marathons because we then have the fucker cause he, we took, we took the four big marrow bones and he wound up getting over on another night at dark and stoled some of our marrow bones out of our cash. But we didn't see it happen. Anyhow, Rick's point now, I don't think you should mess with like, he's like, that's an animal that I think is off and we're like, why is that? He's like, well, they Rome. One of the things he was talking about, he was like, man, they cover so much ground. You know, they'll have a home range, you know, they'll go 250 miles. It's like, yeah, but we just killed a Caribou and Caribou go a thousand miles hundreds of miles. So it's not distance traveled. No, it's just a, it's just something, you know. It's like, yeah, it's just something. Well, people are pairs, of course.

Speaker 3:          01:45:03       The way you describe it. Charismatic megafauna. Yeah, that's, that's not my term, but it's a great. I hats off to whoever did. I'm sure you could find out who invented the charismatic megafauna there's attributed to you. So I'm going to leave it with, you know, I didn't come up with it. I heard a linguist one day. You could find it. Hurdle linguists one day talking about, uh, he, he was interested in tracking where things come from. That would be an easy case, but you know, what he was interested in tracking was a waitresses saying, are you still working on that?

Speaker 3:          01:45:32       Because there was a time when no one said that and then all of a sudden everyone said it and he was interested. Where did, are you still working on that? Come from the one mouth that it first came out of. So yeah, I didn't know. Charismatic megaphone is great and I think that there's some things are so charismatic wolves and grizzlies that like New Jersey cat ladies know about them. Did you see that? The, the billboard that they were all cecil, there was a lion hugging a bear that was trying to stop the bear hunt in New Jersey. No, he never saw it. I know that you don't even guy someone, you know, the pedals, the bear as Sherman's shot pedals. How rude.

Speaker 3:          01:46:16       Like whenever something like that happens. Man, I remember reading it. I read it right when I, right when it came out like a fish and game agency. They're just a little background is a bear. Is there kind of a neighborhood bear in New Jersey? And he had had some kind of injury or uh, possibly birth defect where he wasn't able to. He spent a lot of time walking bipedaly yeah. Um, which is not uncommon, which is probably when he had his, he had obvious injuries in his front section. So would, would walk. Yeah. Debbie, not uncommon and probably,

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       you know, it could be a lot of the things we have about harming, you know, like, like large, mysterious and it's could come from, you know, obviously bears walking around their back feet. But you know, New Jersey had their. Have they haven't, I don't want to say I don't want to have this mean too many, but they have a exploding population of black. I'm always reluctant to say something's overpopulated because you always got to ask like according to whose definition is it, like the automobile insurance comp industry, because they'll say everything's over populated that you might run over with your car. Agricultural interests have a different definition of overpopulated, so they have a shitload of bears. That's a fair statement. They had a hunting season. Turns out some guy comes into a check station and he had shot this bear that walks around on his back feet and they'd given him the name pedals because he'd taken two scavenging bird feeders and stuff around the neighborhood.

Speaker 2:          01:47:39       And um, so I can't remember the magazine, one of those, one of those dip shitty a New York online magazines and just basically coles basically steals shit out of the New York Times and writes its own interpretations of New York Times articles. Wasn't Gawk or something like that. Said that pedals had been assassinated? Yes. Oh, I read that. But what are those websites that all they do is like hack on traditional media, but then they just write articles commenting on traditional media stories. Yeah, but they're not generating leads. Let's look at this billboard ban the bear hunt. Bear all seesaw. They're crying, they're crying, they have cartoon tears like literal and look how the bears hugging or the line rather is hugging the bear. Poor babies. Yeah. That's a nice billboard. Um, what, what about pedals? Oh, the people that get the charismatic megafauna because another that we talked about, our podcast recently, we had a biologist on, um, who works for the Kalispell tribe, you know, Indian tribe and that historically you were in Idaho portions of Washington and portions of Montana.

Speaker 2:          01:48:49       Um, and they're very involved and Caribou Mountain Caribou recovery in the US. So most people do not know that. Um, traditional, traditional. We had a Caribou population that drifted down from, drifted from Canada down into northern Washington, northern Idaho, northwest Montana. We don't have that now at all. Well, it was about a dozen of them. Okay. Right at this moment that we're talking right now, there are some, a couple miles from the US border inside Canada, but there used to be the last legal one to be killed wasn't. It was back in the 19 twenties. What happened in was just disturbances that habitat, um, uh, there was always a small, not a large number of them and we had a lot of things that mess with their travel corridors, development road, construction, logging activities and now they, they rarely ever drift down into the US, but as an active recovery area there. So we got about a dozen Caribou that are contenders to be in theU , s net sometimes we'll actually crossed and come into the US in the selkirk mountains. No one gives a shit

Speaker 4:          01:50:03       about mountain Caribou.

Speaker 2:          01:50:07       The amount of like energy, the amount of mental energy that goes into people's favorite animals at the expense of other good projects. We could be other good wildlife projects we could be working on. Kind of boggles my mind. Black bears you have. So we have enough black bears that we have black bear hunting seasons and I think 36 states.

Speaker 4:          01:50:33       Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:50:34       Rapidly expanding population of black bears and people will spend enormous amounts of energy and resources because it's like I don't understand it and they're just. And they just like are willfully ignorant about other wildlife issues that are much more important because it's like, it's not cuddly. It doesn't look fuzzy. Well, they don't have a stuffed one. I don't know what it is. Stuffed Teddy bears. There's a lot of it. The what

Speaker 1:          01:51:01       we, we've gotten accustomed to thinking of these things is our friends. It's Yogi bear. We, we've done these anthropomorphization with these cartoons and television shows and it's ingrained in the consciousness of a lot of people. No matter what you do, you can't get it out of there. There's, there's some legitimate differences between animals. You know, we were talking about that yesterday. We were talking about the differences between bears and deer. Like deer looks at you in a bear, looks at you. You know about how when I was talking before the show about whitetail deer, it's like catching the other day. You in a way, nothing has ever looked at. Look at you. That's their electric. Their eyes are like, they like, no, you're there to kill them. And they're like, oh, that's fucking person. I've got to get out of hand. Or a bear looks at you like going on here, can I eat you?

Speaker 1:          01:51:45       Can you eat me? You know, there's like a weird sort of relationship that people have with bears. Like they look at you and. But they don't look at you with the same sort of intense fear that a game animal looks at you. Yeah. There's this blurring of the lines there and I think that when we think of animals that we eat, we have very distinct classifications. You tell people you eat bear. They go, Oh God. And I did, you know when the first hunts that you tried to take me on was black bear hunt? And I was like, man, I don't want to go. It took some getting used to. Yeah. Now I'm like, when we go on, let's go get some blueberry bears. Yeah, I have.

Speaker 2:          01:52:23       I, you know, I have the same. I had the same problem. Why do I do create a hierarchy? But I also try to like question where the hierarchy has come from. It comes from. And to suss out contradiction, but the only problem to me where it gets problematic for me is the way that in which it seems that you can get some American, so excited about preventing any kind of exploitation of a handful of species, yet there, yet they remain completely uninvolved with the,

Speaker 2:          01:52:58       with the the issues and politics and recovery efforts of other things that needed really that need it right now. Yeah. You know the fact that with wolves and grid like certain populations of grizzly bears, certain populations of wolves have reached recovery objective. Yet we still cover them on the endangered species act because people are wanting to use the endangered species act to save things from any threat of exploitation at all, like nothing to do with what? Nothing to do with what the legislation was meant for. It's become. It's become the favorite animal act, and if you want to initiate something called the favor animal act and try to get it passed by Congress, feel free, but don't steal the ESA and take it away from its intended purpose. In order to protect your stuffed animal animal

Speaker 1:          01:53:45       sales, you had a very important point on one of your podcast where you're talking about population numbers, population objectives, and you were saying that will like if you look at a elk, for example, in some places elk are extremely common. You know, in Colorado for instance, there's more elk in Colorado that I think any other state, but yeah. Bye Bye. I think of almost like a factor too. There's a lot. So if you tell people in Colorado that elk are in danger, they're like, what the fuck are you talking about? Go to Florida. There's no elk and elk are gone. Wolves, same thing, right? Elk are gone from 90 percent of their historic range in the US. Wow. Ninety percent. Yet no one has a problem with elk hunting seasons, right, exactly. But them, that's the thing. Who is eating wolves? Well, that's the problem. And Wolf Dog. No, I don't think it's an arctic explorer as his favorite wild meat. What's loved? Oh, he's a psycho dude. You know, he ate two carpaccio.

Speaker 2:          01:54:40       He ate a, they found a. Oh, a desiccated whale beached. And it had been like in the, in the salt and its tongue was dried out and he cut the tongue out and he said the how. They boiled repeatedly, repeatedly tried to get the salt out and eventually ate it. And then he ran into some eskimo hunters who said that thing been laying there for three years.

Speaker 1:          01:55:08       Jesus Christ. What? He was hardcore. How the fuck did he eat in three year old tongue.

Speaker 2:          01:55:14       Like you said, you just kept boiling it and rebounded. Do it hit anyone. Like if you want to do, he can't have that some bitch on your podcast. He made Stevinson. He's got a book my life with the Eskimo. So he made first contact with a lot of people in the High Arctic. They knew he was meeting people who knew about whites but hadn't met and yet. Wow. And what was funny about this dude is how frustrated he would get with a trying to show him his shit, which he thought they'd be blown away by. So He'd let get out a gun or one day, he's one days. Explain to people that we can do. He's like, my people, you know, we can do surgery. What year was this? He was making first contact and the early 19 hundreds of Blake, like coronation goal Victoria island up open the Canadian High Arctic again.

Speaker 2:          01:55:59       They knew, they knew that there was whites. They hadn't met any whites yet and he'd come to them and um, he'd expect blown way. Like he, he shows some guys his firearm has gone and this dude's like, yeah, that's cool. But I know a guy that can shoot his bow and his error will travel to the far side of the mountain and kill a care with the, you can't even see. Or he was saying we can do surgery on people do an appendectomy. And he says, I know a guy that can take your whole spine and skull and brain out and put it back in again. He was talking about telescopes and he's like, you can see the moon craters. And they're like, I know guys been to the moon in haunted there. So that's one upmanship dude. It's like, it's the greatest book man.

Speaker 2:          01:56:55       How frustrated he gets from one of the cool things he describes as a, he describes how they would kill, you know, when they killed a polar bear, they would bring the head back and put in their lodge, sort of like, I don't want to draw it, like I don't want to push this too far, but much in the same way you might bring a head home and hanging on your wall. They would bring it home and put in their lodge and the thinking has explained to staff and some was that um, I'm bringing him home so that he can observe me and my family and see that we're good people. And when he goes to the afterlife he will tell other bears if you got to get killed by somebody, not a bad guy to have it happen. That guys. Okay. And I often point out about the, the animal skulls and hides in my own home that I feel like, you know, I don't want to make myself seem to spirits will in some ways I, I think of that. I think of that with the animals. I haven't in my. Just a concept that you run in your mind, eh, that I run in my mind. I think about him. Why was I talking about step? Oh, loved wolf. So he ate every damn thing like Muskox, Caribou, walrus. He ate everything. And in talks repeatedly about his preference for wolf meet preference. Above all, I'm telling you, you read my life with the Eskimo. Well, you ate a coyote. Yeah. What was that like? Didn't like it.

Speaker 2:          01:58:18       But here's the problem that I've run into because I in, in Vietnam, I a fair bit of domestic dog. I Caio and I know monkey red howler monkey. Those are my big, my big transgressions of me. You know, we all, like I said, I admitted earlier to having my own animal hierarchies and those were the times when I've sort of strayed uncomfortable ground for myself. I'm canines and hominids or they hominid no, not a harm in primate primate. So, um, yeah, I, I get like a, a, I get where I can't really tell what it tastes like. It's difficult to tell what it actually taste like because you're feeling that there's so many other things going on, emotions, thoughts, contributions and and I get like a hot, a hot guilty feeling, Woo. But when I was in Vietnam, they described dog as a hot food and I kept asking him what that meant because I didn't really understand but it does it like makes me sweaty.

Speaker 2:          01:59:19       I thought it was like a guilt thing, but people would, they would eat it and serve it around the holidays. So the lunar new year, it was auspicious. Suspicious. It's auspicious to eat dog meat in the days leading up to the lunar new year and it's a game. It's a food that you have. It's like a risky enterprise and summer. Vietnam is kind of a risky enterprise to eat deer and it'd be like a dog. Yeah. I'm sorry to eat dog. And it's like some of the people like these restaurants open up that are only open that time of year and there's people coming in to like bring in good luck, risky enterprise. How so a guy told me that. One of the guys I interviewed told me that he was unable to get his, he's unable to have children and they determined that it was. It was on him. His wife was fertile, he was infertile. He ate dog

Speaker 2:          02:00:18       and it changed. His fortunes have changed his luck and he got his wife pregnant. Now he says, I will not eat dog again for fear that I would undo what I did. It's a powerful food. This is a sentiment held more in the north than in the held more like I spent time in Hanoi and I spent time in Saigon or Ho Chi Minh City as the sentiment that was expressed, more like in more of a semi spiritual way in the north than it was in the south. Now, a translator that I had hired a told me I don't eat dark. Uh, he said, I don't eat dogs. I have a dark.

Speaker 2:          02:01:01       I went to his house to see his dog. I come in and the dog is in a small cage probably. I'm not exaggerating. I say it was, yeah, I mean it was probably maybe two feet by three and a half feet and it's a wire mesh cage and there's a, like a drip pan below it basically to collect the animal's waste and, and there's a bowl of rice in the dog, just goes ape shit and when, when we come in and it just like looking at the dog, it just was not, it just did not seem like a well dog. Okay. I said to him, uh, and he lives like a very busy in Hanoi,

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       like you walk out and it's just the full Vietnam may him scooters. It's just like insane. And I said to him, so you just take them out, like you can just go walk them

Speaker 4:          02:01:50       here.

Speaker 3:          02:01:52       And he kind of looks at me like he doesn't understand when talking about. And it turns out that that dog hadn't been out of that cage since he brought it home. That was his pet dog, which he kept like a parakeet Jesus Christ. He said I wouldn't eat. Now conversely,

Speaker 3:          02:02:10       in the training, I went out to a farm. There were a guy has a small plot of land, he's there, they have like a, basically there's was system there, the you have very poor farmers who don't own the land, but it's state owned land, government own land, but they have subsistence farms and this guy raised a sugar cane. He had an air gun, you can't have a regular gun, but he had an air gun and he would hunt various, uh, arboreal marsupial's and, and things to eat and he had some water river flowing through his place and he had a small amount of livestock and raise some crops and peppers and various things and he had a bunch of dogs running around on his place, just pet dogs. He was explaining to me that now and then when the dogs are bred up to a number that's hard to support them, the dog buyer comes and the dog buyer will give you some cash for your excess dog population.

Speaker 3:          02:03:07       And those are the dogs that go into the markets of Vietnam. Other countries actually have places where they're like breeding and rearing dogs for slaughter. But that was the Vietnamese system. So it might've been, I have many interesting things about this whole thing is about being like comparing like this guy's pet to this guy's livestock. You sort of got into this thing as which is the more enviable position, which is more enviable position livestock. I'll take that life over. Then living in the cage, shitting onto like a great. And I went to visit a guy that actually a wholesaler who buys the dogs from farmers on the countryside and he comes back and they fatten. They would fatten the dogs on beef, stomach beef trim. Basically the stuff that in the US we send a rendering plants. Like, like when, when when they slaughter cat, almost everything, you know, once the meats gone, everything goes to a rendering plant.

Speaker 3:          02:04:06       He would buy basically what us production facility send to a rendering plant and that's what he would fatten dog on. And you'd go to the markets and they'd have dogs stack like just dog part stacked up pyramids at the market. It was bizarre to see man, and I'll tell you I'm a, I went out in different places and with different people and different things. I went out for seven nights in a row and I could never get beyond. I could never get beyond my own biases about what's food and what's not food. It was just like very difficult for me to, to eat it and fake my way through and it was hard. So I do understand when people come to me and they're looking, they're like, hey man, a bear, like in, uh, you know, I'm 100. I've, I've 100 grade I've hunted and eaten hundreds and hundreds of pounds of black bear meat.

Speaker 3:          02:04:58       Um, when people come in, they're like, dude, I just like, I don't want to act like that. They're coming. When people come to me and express disapproval, right? I don't want to act like I can't understand where they're coming from because I had the same thing I felt there. Right. I've ever making the argument. I never fact checked it, but I feel it is. There are more people in this world who live in a country where it's socially acceptable to eat dog meat. The not. I haven't formally fact check that, but I remember looking at some basic figures and thinking that that was true.

Speaker 1:          02:05:34       Well, it's interesting that we choose to not eat pigs, but pigs are probably as intelligent if not more to choose to eat pigs rather. Yeah. Probably as intelligent or more than dogs. Yeah, and dogs are probably more dangerous when they're feral than pigs are. Yeah. When pigs are feral, they generally avoid people. When dogs are feral, they known always. I mean there was an instance a couple years ago outside of Atlanta were an elderly couple was attacked and someone was killed by wild dogs.

Speaker 3:          02:06:04       Yeah. The Australian Dingo traces back to being a is a, is a dog who knows it's ancestry to, to human activities. So that's it really.

Speaker 1:          02:06:14       So it used to be a domesticated animal. It was, yeah. It was a very early form. Wow. Check that out. Make sure I'm right about that. What the, what the genetic history that Dingo is.

Speaker 3:          02:06:24       What's their wild dog called?

Speaker 1:          02:06:26       Dingo. Dingo. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think it's some kind of a. it's like a dog breed. Probably Find Adam Green tree holding one up by his ankles to the fucking

Speaker 6:          02:06:36       bowl

Speaker 1:          02:06:38       arrow hole. And it's a wild dog. Says wild but lupus. But what's, uh, what's his ancestry? Just uh, just google dingoes were once domestic dogs. Dingo domesticated animal.

Speaker 3:          02:06:59       I'm looking at the genetic status origin here. I'll just pull it up so you can see Indian wolf and Arabian Wolf evolved from.

Speaker 6:          02:07:07       Hmm. Here.

Speaker 3:          02:07:09       Mad. Don't feel like I'm wrong.

Speaker 1:          02:07:13       Hm. Interesting. Widely held. The dingoes have evolved from the Indian Wolf. Yeah, right there. 6,000, 10,000 years ago. Bread from a was assumed for all domestic dogs. The theory was based on the morphological similarities of the Dingo skulls and the skulls of the subspecies of wolves. Genetic analysis indicated that a much earlier domestication. Huh? Oh. So there is a domestication. New study suggests dingoes may have in the south China. Okay. So you have humans. Interesting. So they were originally domesticated and then cut loose. Yeah, we, I mean, I, I've told you, I mean I have my own. I had my own thing about bear and then I hunted bear and eight bear. And then that thing went away. Yeah. Yeah. It's just been this what it is, but it still doesn't seem the same to me as like a deer. Like if you, if you gave me a choice, hey, would you rather go hon? Axis deer, which I've never hunted seems so much more natural to me. Think go hunt black bear.

Speaker 2:          02:08:14       Yeah. I know. I have such a complicated, a complicated sets of feelings about black bears. And as a hunter strange, I've gotten to the thing where I'm maybe before I even say I'm going to say why it's not quite strange. I have found that a lot of big game hunters

Speaker 4:          02:08:37       will

Speaker 2:          02:08:39       do some amount of bear hunting, get a couple of bears and then drift away from bear hunting. Um, they still respect how difficult it is and how much you can learn about barriers by fine at blop you have gotten some bears are always excited to go on a bear hunt if it's someone's first

Speaker 4:          02:09:01       bear hunt,

Speaker 2:          02:09:03       like to like, you know, I have no desire if you want to go, I would love to go along. But it's something to happen. But whereas like something like elk, the more you get and the more you eat, the more you want to get in, the more you want to eat.

Speaker 1:          02:09:16       Right. But you don't, you think that's a public pressure thing though in a lot of ways about bears because I, I've described even to my friends about hunting bear and that just put their head back like they're fine with me hunting deer. They're fine with me. Hunting pigs. Everybody seems to be in supportive hunting pigs. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:09:30       You know how my brother, you know, my brother put the bear thing is. Here's the conundrum for him and it's pretty simple. I'm a bear. Has a very beautiful, very usable hide. Okay. So you know like deer hides. You can, you can throw it through a process, you can get like a buck skin from it. You can get some deer hides, you can get a pretty good usable leather that, that the use used to make apparel. In fact, everybody knows Daniel Boone, right? Daniel Boone was a much of his life was spent in the business of trading deer hides. Daniel Boone was a commercial hunter. He will go out and shoot white tail deer in the summer when their hides were thin and sell them, and it was used for industrial work where it was used for work apparel. Like basically the 17 fifties version of carhartt close was made out of deer hide summer. Dear. I'm not familiar with that term. Carhartt. What does that mean? Like carhartt work wear? Carhartt jackets, Carhartt Pants, Jesus Christ. Joe. No, I know. Dickies. Yeah, same thing. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       I never heard a carhartt. This same thing with Jamie. Like you know, like work pants. He got like a little holster for a hammer and shut up inside of them. Yeah. Okay. I'm so used to make them out of Buckskin. Yeah. Like work, work apparel and his time was making bucks again. Those things smelled great. At the end of the day I'll do. My Dad had my dad saved a lot of his deer and had a uh, an had a sport coat made out of his own deer and do that thing was amazing and smelled good. Really? I'll do as a nicest jacket. He's dead. I should find. I should go dig around and stuff and find that he, it was dyed black is beautiful coat, but it hadn't had one mate. You've shot a lot of deer. Well that wasn't good at is. Uh, it's like, yes you can do stuff with, but it's not really in today's age of other fabrics is not practical.

Speaker 3:          02:11:20       However, a bear hide has timeless beauty and timeless application. Have you ever thought about making a jacket at a bear hide? Yes. Did you ever do it? Yeah. Well no, because what I was doing for a long time was saving up my bear hides and I wanted to cut them into like nine or 10 inch squares and have a very large conflict are made out of many different bears cut into squares stitched. I haven't given up on that idea, but I give a lot of my bear hides away to people who really liked them anyway. When you get a bear, it's like no one in their right mind gets rid of a bear hide. Right? So you get one and you get a Tan and then you've got to bear hide. And once you got to bear hide and it's like on the floor and then you got bear hide over the back of the couch and you got to bear hide hanging on the wall, you get to a point where, um, you don't need any more bear hides, you eat the meat and you have the highest but you don't need more bear hides and when you get a bear there's an expense to getting the high prepared but you feel wasteful not using the height.

Speaker 3:          02:12:20       So it was very hard to shoot a bear just for me. Right, because you feel like you're wasting something that people really want and it's beautiful. And people like to use the, decorate their homes and use it as a totem of the wild as opposed to a white tail deer with very few people do anything with the highest. Yeah. So now, like one day Danny was like the last bear he got, he got up to the bear and, and, and found himself just kinda. He goes, I just don't, I don't need, you know, like I look at it and I'm like, I have like a set of obligations that this animal now and uh, I'm not excited about it anymore. I don't want another bear hide. It's, it's an expense. Then he just, he never killed another bear. Wow. He's got some bear hides and he loves, but he just, he just got to where he's got enough other stuff to eat. He's a moose snob. He killed a moose every year. Likes the moose meat, um, feeds his family, moves, feeds his family salmon primarily. Well, if he kills a moose every year. The other problem with that is you're talking about like 600 pounds of meat, right? Yeah. He's got a family of four. He Burns through it plus let me, I'll eat. Yeah. So, but that's just kinda like where he got in. I knew a lot of people, for whatever reason, I used to hunt bears and my other brother and then he don't.

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       He, he like when he's out at his, his, when he's out at his wife's ranch, he'll see bears running around during bear sees and he doesn't even think about going hunting for him and he used to hunt bears. What happens? And you just quit. You just quit wanting to hunt bears. One of my favorite episodes of yours was on the Prince of Wales Island where you had a bear in your site and just decided, I don't want to shoot this bear. Yeah. It's just like I, I really, I enjoy watching them. I enjoy hunting. I enjoy making smoke. Black Bear Hams out, but it's like, uh, I, I, uh, would you ever do that with any other animal though? Do what? Look at it and say, I don't want to shoot this. Like if you saw mature, a mature mule deer, 180 inch mule deer. No, no. Right, right. But I could picture like with, with, you know it, there's a handful of animals that

Speaker 2:          02:14:27       you know what it is you can't. One of is, one of the things is this, I can't help but watch a bear if I'm out and I glass up a bear, you know, when I say out glass up, I mean like if I'm sitting on a big glass and tin or glass and knob up some highway, have a commanding view of the lands glassing meaning use your binoculars to look at the landscape the way that the way I generally hunt. I hunt a lot of open country in the American west and then Alaska and things where you have good visibility. Um, the bulk of the time I spent hunting, I spend on a good lookout point, a high point where you can see, you know, a good one, hundred 80 degree view or maybe not always 108, sometimes three 60, whatever, a commanding view of the surrounding landscape.

Speaker 2:          02:15:14       And we generally hunt by sitting there and observing a with binoculars and just watching, watching, watching to the point where sometimes we'll spend days doing nothing but watching animals through binoculars. And um, and when you get good at this, you, you find animals that people would never in a million years find that other people would never in a million years locate when I'm doing that and I find a bear and I'm observing a bear, you, I would never leave that bear to go do some other thing. When you find a bear, like when I find a bear, I watch him until he's gone. You can't turn away from them because I always feel like at any point he's going to do some amazing thing that would blow your mind. Like, what? I don't like crush something skull. I don't know. They're just, they like are always doing weird things. They eat a vast array of things. My friend John Dudley was watching a bear through his binoculars and he saw a bear run up on a Moose and smash it on the back and crush it. That's what I talking. He saw grizzly smash a on the back and break its back, literally hit it so hard that it snapped the Moose is back and then he tackled it once it was down, started eating. I haven't seen that, but that's what I'm looking for. So you watch them and there's this sort of anticipation was seeing them right.

Speaker 2:          02:16:46       Deer, they're very interesting and the more you wash them, the more you learn about them. And the thing that I've always been fascinated by and was talking about with some friends of mine recently was, um, how interested I become an interpersonal relationship is among mule deer, like the body language they use and how you can locate deer that you can't see just based on body language of deer that you can see that you watch them and you become aware of things that are aware of and you learn where other things are that are out of your view. Just by how, just by what it's doing, both male and female. Generally it's, it's doe, not sometimes in a general, the most obvious one is dosed that no, there's a buck around. You took me for body language there and then doles that are encountering another band of Doe's have a body language they use and you just get used to this and you sort of a base. Yeah, and then once you see it you go like, oh, he knows about it. There's a deer somewhere that's not net group and that deer is aware of the fact that the deer is not in the group and it's like wondering about it and you just see that. So I'm interested that kind of stuff. But I could walk away from deere.

Speaker 2:          02:18:01       You, I could see there's some deer and I can just go look in another direction. Something about me makes me stare at bears. Wow. I can't give up on them. Like I just like I'm watching them, watching them, watching them. Do you have the same feeling about wolverines? Does the first bull run over? See my whole life. That was the one that was the thing on my checklist. Like as far as like if you large land mammals. That was the one I was missing. So you'd never seen one? I mean, yeah, large like American land, mammals. I. That was me. That was the one missing from my list. Do you think you'd feel a feeling of remorse if you shot the one that you. The only one you saw. That's why I said I wasn't going to touch that screen because of that. Yeah. I even said right then in there I said I'm not going to shoot the first one is something I saw.

Speaker 2:          02:18:40       That's how I feel like when I was saying earlier about the black hole of Africa, I always imagined that guy's going to Africa and being like, no shit. That's what one of those shoes look like. Well that's right. It is. Yes. I just didn't, I hadn't built up a context about it. So then we're like talking about. So if you see another one, yeah, I'd, I'd reconsider. But no, I didn't want to shoot the first wolverine I ever laid eyes on. That's what I was trying to get. You know, Yannis has seen, um, you know, he's been out Caribou hunting and watch wolverine scavenge and Caribou Carcasses. And so I was like, you know, he's not the first one you saw and then we just dilly dallied no one so he could have shot it because it wasn't the first one he saw, but no one was feeling any. It was just one of those things. No one was feeling, I felt, you know, great. Assuming I remember watching my youtube, by the way, a white tail deer looks you. I remember watching the

Speaker 5:          02:19:27       first links I ever saw and um, I feel that, uh, uh, um, anthropomorphizing a fair bit here, but he was the first links that I ever saw and I just had a strong feeling that I was the first person he ever saw a look of. I'm a look of like sheer, like uncomprehensive for what he was seeing. Wow. And he's like, he's like, is this good, bad? What does this mean? And you see what kind of run through all these calculations in his mind and just drift off. Like after awhile I, he's like, Eh, something about it. This thing has got its eyes, him looking at me like his eyes are centered on his face, right? Like a Predator maybe for someone tells me something, you know, he's looking at me very intently. He's not trying to act like I'm not there and therefore he can't see me, you know, and you just see them kind of run it through his head and just be like, yeah, no, because nothing good's going to come out.

Speaker 5:          02:20:37       I didn't go off the road direction, but just based on where I was. Yeah. I mean it was very safe to say he'd never run into a person and I'd never run into a length. We just had this moment of um, you know, I, I carry a, an, a, a cultural awareness. So I at least knew about what I was looking at but, but he was in this point of I'm just, you know, processing and like the white tail that you encountered who damn sure knew what that, that thing carries with it. Yeah. We talked about it before the podcast started, but, uh, I was hunting with my friend John Dudley and we were in the tree stand and we were supposed to get down at 1:30 and at 1:25. I'm like, what do you want you want to call it and then eat lunch. He's like, yeah, so I climbed down first and that 1:25 like five fucking minutes before we set it and this big mature whitetail walks through and John Signals to me does the bowl winkle thing, but putting his thumbs on his head and he starts pointing and then I realized as a deer coming down the path and so I kind of hide behind the tree, but there was all these branches in front of me.

Speaker 5:          02:21:38       Anyway, you've already heard the story, but for the people listening, that deer locked eyes with me and there was this intensity, like immediate intensity in his eyes that had never experienced an animal looking at me like it was. It was very tuned in. He knew exactly that I shouldn't be there and I just froze. I was wearing Camo. He's looking me right in the face, like right in. His eyes were bulging out of his head. I turned around and bolted, but it's like electricity to them like they know I have very vivid memories of when I was 12 and had just hit legal hunting age and Michigan and I was sitting on the ground hunting squirrels on a farm owned by a man named, uh, there a lot and leaning against a tree and, and having,

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       uh, uh, for corn white tail coming through the woods and you know, like this, like a buck like that. This isn't always true, but Gianluca for chrome white tells a year and a half old the way, even at that time, you start hunt squirrels, September 15 and Michigan. So, I mean, that deere was, you know, he could have been as little as 15, 16 months old. He locked on to me, saw me and knew to look in my eyes but didn't know what the Hell I was. I remember him coming at me and coming at me and coming at me and getting so scared and I and I had always known like, you just like there's a thing you just like, you don't yell in the woods like you don't make noise in the woods. You'd try to be quiet. And it was. I remember grabbing sticks and trying to snap them to make a noise to make that deer spook off, you know, but being like conflicted between just being scared shitless and doing the thing you don't do like as a hunter is you just learn like don't make loud noises in the woods when people made loud noises.

Speaker 3:          02:23:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:23:29       It makes me cringe, man. Well, what's interesting about this mature deer that saw me and freaked out when he saw me is that literally a minute before that, because I was down when I was down, that deer came through with two other deer and one of 'em look to be like maybe a two year old deer. And one of them was baby. One of them was like one year old and the one year old got within 15 feet of me. Yeah. I just pinned up against the tree and the one year old walked right by me, had no idea it was alive. The other one that was younger deer walked by me, didn't look my direction at all. The old one looked right at me. He's like, fuck this. He knew right away he'd seen people before maybe. I mean they're in Iowa and I was really different because I always a great state for bow hunting because they have a very short gun season. It's only shotgun. So. Oh yeah. Yeah. You don't get a big rifle heart. Right. So a lot of what they're dealing with is a bowhunters. So He. I mean, he might've known that I had a bow. I mean, who the fuck knows? Saw a bow and say, I've seen that fucking thing before. Somebody shot me in the ass with one of those a year ago. That's one of the things I like that egg

Speaker 3:          02:24:30       about big bucks. I, you know, I think that culturally in this country we're kind of getting where it's almost like this thick accepted idea that you're supposed to hate trophy hunters. Right. But um, I eat everything I kill and I will even talk about there's like meat box and shooter box, right? And meaning like there's like big huge box that are cool and meat box they eat, but I always eat my shooter box. It's like, you know, like shoot, a big buck is elite one. It's illegal. Two, I love them. You can Pepsi challenge them. I can. Pepsi challenge of five-year-old deer and in a two year old deer and you can't. Well you can because you're really good at cooking. Yeah. But I'm saying it's good. Yeah. If you know how to cut it and trim it and stuff, they're great. Right? Yeah. So point being I do like to look for big animals.

Speaker 3:          02:25:17       Okay. I like, like if you, if I have to deer and I can go after a small one or go after one, I like to go after the big one. One of the things I like about going after the big one and the challenge of it is that they are harder to get and the reason they're harder to get it because they have learned from mistakes, you know, a big buck to, uh, to, uh, to, uh, experienced hunter when he sees a big buck. He sees more than the antlers, the antlers one up kind of becoming like symbolic of something of a very worthy, challenging cory because he hasn't made any mistakes yet, right? You can have big box in areas that have very low predation and low hunter pressure and he could get big and still make some mistakes because he doesn't have as many mistakes that could be made.

Speaker 3:          02:26:07       But a really big buck and an area that has a lot of lines, a lot of coyotes, wolves, human hunters. Um, he's big because he doesn't, he hasn't messed up, he hasn't fucked up, doesn't fuck up. He remembers stuff, you know, we had a occasion to watch. We're hunting in Colorado hunt mule deer this year. And we watched, um, I glanced up at pretty nice buck and they went up and do an aspen grove. He was traveling with a bunch of dose and they all go into an aspen grove later. Yannis was looking above there and he said, there's some coyotes rolling down into that aspen grove where all the deer, when it's now the middle of the day and it's rifle season, has been rifle season on and off through a couple of weeks of hunting season, the coyotes go into the Aspen Grove. All those deer component out of that Aspen Grove.

Speaker 3:          02:26:58       I at the time comment on how it seemed like someone like squeezing a tube of toothpaste, the way the deer came shooting out of that Aspen Grove and ran out across a large sage flat exposing themselves. The one deer out of the group that didn't walk out of that stage, that didn't walk out of that Aspen Grove was the big buck. Never budged because he ran a calculation in his head where he's like, I get it. Y'all scared of those coyotes. I'm afraid of the unknown. I would rather stay in here and my little thicket and he stood up, we could see him stand up in there, that son of a bitch would not move and that's during the Rut. So every thing in his body is saying chase those donors and breed those dogs. That's all he's thinking about. His breeding dose. A dumb Bach would have chased those.

Speaker 3:          02:27:47       Those if not for fear of the coyote, he would've chased the dose just because for fear of that, another buck is going to go breed them. But he resisted that. Right? He resisted the fear of the coyotes, but he's like, I know that there is trouble when you run out in the open shit shoots at you or whatever. He knew. Wow. He just sweated it out, you know? Wow. So it's like he didn't like and he lived. He didn't mess up. Well, a big book like that is also kind of threatening to a coyote to. I'm sure. I'm sure that's part of it. Yeah, sure. As part of it, but it's just like he, there's a threat in instinctively or whatever because here's the thing that they weren't, they were not interested in those deer. They weren't chasing him. I think they know because they see they lose Fonz to them all the time. Right. I mean they see stuff die from, but it's like, you know, right now there's a couple of. Kyle's is at that time of year isn't going to drag down a healthy fire. Mueller, they weren't even chasing him, but he just like, he knew, you know. Um, and that's one of the things I admire about like the old ones, if you can consider, if you can go into areas that have heavy hunting pressure and consistently find those deer, it's, you know, it's like, it's the highest challenge. Yeah, man, I respect it. I respect it.

Speaker 1:          02:29:07       Well, it's a very difficult quarry and when you're eating that animal, I mean there's, there's, there's a completely different sense of not just accomplishment but connection to that animal. Then buying some stake in a store or shooting some button buck.

Speaker 3:          02:29:21       Oh yeah. It's such a. that's the thing that winds up being like such an obvious conversation that it's that you sometimes feel like it's. I'm done having that conversation with people who don't get is like shooting fish in a barrel. Right? It's like so obvious and so easy that you almost feel like a little bit like, like almost unfair to bring it up. Will you say that like, yeah. Why do something like pro for the same reason why you challenged to chase after big bucks? Like you're telling me that somehow you like if you eat meat, that somehow the system by which you go about getting meat to farms and stores and Shit like that is somehow morally or aesthetically or or ethically are somehow superior to me eating an animal that I've hunted myself from a sustainable population as well managed and that I've decorated my home with it's parts that will be there until I die and then we'll decorate the homes of my children. If you're telling me somehow that I'm like depraved for that, I have a hard time engaging in the conversation because I can't. I just don't understand it well with other mediators years.

Speaker 1:          02:30:38       It's a ridiculous conversation. It's very short sided conversation and it's part of the problem is that people have so many things going on in their lives there. If you have a job and you have a family and you have some sort of hobby, you've eliminated 90 percent of your time. How much time do you have to actually immerse yourself in wildlife and understand the politics of it, understand what's really going on out there in the world. How many people have actually seen an overhead view of the Pacific northwest and looked down at all the forest and just done the calculations in their head about these animals and how many of them there are and how much of the wild west is filled with animals. And that doesn't stop people from having opinions of, of course, does it.

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       They're just not educated. It's the reason why. And, uh, is the reason why after all these years, I still have no opinion on obamacare because I do not understand it. So I'll point out like I have no opinion now trying to have this infectious result on people where people will stop talking about shit they don't fully understand.

Speaker 1:          02:31:38       No. People have these knee jerk opinions. They're just, they lock them in like this is as a left wing person. I think this is a right wing person. I think that, I think as we pointed out, you and I both,

Speaker 3:          02:31:48       I believe that that's a ridiculous perspective. Can I close a bit of flattery please? Um, it didn't occur to me til I was coming down here today, but I've been railing a lot on, uh, the, the, the echo chamber that we all live in. Um, and I think if anyone goes and you look at your, you look at your facebook feed or any number of things like we surround ourselves with people who tell us what we think, you know, and it's kind of become very obvious and I think that this presidential election cycle really brought it out where you had just two vastly different narratives playing out and people on each side of it feeling like so absolutely certain that not only were they right, but everyone felt the way they felt. Okay. Right. And it's just been a big part of the national conversation. Like the echo chamber thing. Um, what I have found with people that listen to your show who come up to me and be like, oh, I heard you on Joe show. The Times I've been on there is that you haven't, you've somehow managed to defy that where you have the,

Speaker 3:          02:33:00       the right wing nut jobs and the left wing nut jobs all listening to at the same time in the middle of the rotors. But like when someone calls up and says, I was listening to Joe Rogan podcast, I'm always thinking like, like, what does that make you? It doesn't mean anything.

Speaker 3:          02:33:21       It's like, I don't know, just the fact that you listened to it. I don't know what. That doesn't tell me anything about you. Other than that you'd like to wrestle with ideas because this is one of the few places where people are talking about shit and you talk about stuff and bring it up where it's like people are willing because of you in the way you're handling it. They're willing to subject themselves to disparate views for a minute. And I don't know what it is, the formula if you've even thought about it, but it's a nice invention.

Speaker 1:          02:33:50       Uh, it's just how I look at things. I think I don't, uh, you know, I have my rigid lines that I won't cross, you know, where I think something is evil or something is ethically wrong. But I'm willing to entertain ideas and I'm not, I'm not rigid. Like if if someone comes to me and they tell me that I'm wrong about something, I'll go really like, how am I, how am I wrong? If they tell me I'm wrong, I'm like, Oh, I'm fucking wrong. I didn't know it was wrong. Like I'm not married to my ideas and I that's, that's a real problem that people have where they define themselves by their knowledge they, they think they're smart or they're. They think they're valuable because they have a certain amount of information in their head and I think that's crazy because there's, especially as you start getting into more things or get exploring new subjects and new topics, you realize it is impossible to know everything.

Speaker 1:          02:34:38       It's not possible. So for you to define yourself by the knowledge that you know or the knowledge you don't know, it seems kind of crazy. I think you're far better off defining yourself, not even defining yourself, but far better off approaching the world by searching for the truth, you know, and not being connected or married to any ideas. It's far too often people get into these discussions with people and it becomes a game of trying to win, you know, trying to one up the person with information or data and then coming along, coming off of that with the victory. Yeah, no, I'm with you. Yeah, I mean that's what you're seeing on all these news shows, man. You seen. One of the things that I did during the election was while the debates were going on in and post debate, I would bounce back and forth and spend an hour on Fox News and an hour on cnn and I was like, what is the world like?

Speaker 1:          02:35:27       This is so baffling because these are, these are just enforced narratives from one side and the other. And I think the, the, the country suffers because of that. People suffer because of that. It's a tribal inclination that I think we have to, uh, to support one side or the other or to adopt these predetermined patterns of behavior are predetermined belief systems or the or that it's shameful to switch positions. Yeah. That it's a flip flopper like how the fuck do you not learn? I mean he, he, you can't be right all the time and you can have preconceived notions that turned out to be incorrect and you have to be able to recognize those. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:36:05       it's good. I enjoy like I enjoy talking to you.

Speaker 1:          02:36:09       Oh, thank you. It's always fun. Bad. We should definitely do this more often. But I think um, yeah, I mean I, I appreciate that perspective that you have to, that you are willing to say it was like I don't have an opinion on obamacare because I really don't know know enough about it. That's, that's really healthy and really important and for some reason really rare, especially with a well read person like yourself. It makes you sound a little bit like a dumb ass. I sound like a dumb ass all the time, but I'm willing to say it, you know, you know, I would be remiss if we ended this podcast without discussing the revenant because you fucking crushed me on that. I love that movie. I thought it was bad ass and I found out it was all bullshit.

Speaker 2:          02:36:49       I, I only have a couple minutes. I got a, I got to leave, but I'll, uh, explain everything that was bullshit about the revenue first I want to say, um, my, my dear friend and colleague, Mo Fallon loves the revenue. I love Mo. He was out of town. I, He was, he was hoping to come by and say hi. But he's, he's in a, he's in. Where is he? He's in the middle east somewhere. No, he's in Oman right now in Jordan. So he, uh, he loves it because it's cinematography and that's the end of the conversation for him, but he's a cinematographer right now as a student of american history and someone who, who's favorite era is the mountain man era, which, which ran away to define the mountain man and rob. It began kind of like the moment lewis and clark made it back to st louis after their expedition and a man named john colter turned around and went back out west to trap beaver. The mountain man era began. One could argue that day and it ended when the last rendezvous was held for the free trappers, which is an 18 forties, very short period of time. That's my favorite time period of american history is the mountain man era and it was um, the, the, the great escapades and discoveries and adventure to the mountain men played out in the arid west,

Speaker 4:          02:38:13       uh,

Speaker 2:          02:38:14       in the willow lined riparian zones of the american great plains and into Montana and valleys by taking the most famous story from the mountain man era, which was the mauling by bare of, um, how was his name not cold, was his name, glass glass. By taking that story and setting it in the nbc along the edges of the boreal forest and a sop and dripping landscape of conifers,

Speaker 4:          02:38:49       uh,

Speaker 2:          02:38:51       was a, was just a distortion of, of every. It'd be like if you were making a movie about the people who came when, when Washington and franklin and everyone came together to drop the american constitution and you set it like in the jungles of Thailand. Okay. It's like instead of philadelphia, it just struck me to the core. Everything. Hugh glass did not have a child. You didn't have a son who he was avenging. Hugo asked, got mauled by a bear and they left him in the protection of jim bridger, a very young jim bridger was a teenager and another guy and hugh glass through much struggled, crawled his way back to I'm a fort and he later confronted bridger

Speaker 2:          02:39:38       and said, just so you know, a body, next time someone leaves you to watch a guy died in the woods, don't leave them laying around by himself, and that was all he did. That's it. It's a story of forgiveness. Whoa. Now in the movie, he does forgive Bridger who cowers, but then he has to go after the guy that killed the son. He didn't have. And it's like, if you love the story as it exists, to me it's like the bible. It'd be like if you were going to go film a movie about the bible, but change real big parts of it. He added aliens. Yeah. Or like it was how people, when

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       it was help is probably how people felt when last temptation of christ came out and they had, you know, the christ figure lusting for, can't remember, you know, people were like, it was an abomination. Right. Um, so for me to like take parts of, of, of a story that demonstrates sort of the american landscape and american grit and turn it into a british colombian, um, you knoW, uh, a canadian farce. It just was insulting to me. Well, how about the fact that he fell off a cliff and landed on a tree. The lot of that stuff was offsets all fake. None of that happened? No. He did a lot of crawling and I think he ate a rattlesnake. he did come across. He stoled, uh, he came across a, a, a wolf kill and scavenge some parts from and most will use doing this kroll.

Speaker 3:          02:41:04       Who could he walk it all? You know, I don't know at wHat point he started walking. He started out crawling. It's a great story. I have done damn movie like that. I would have called it the crawling person, sort of like toM hanks and lost right when he's on the island and it's a lot of struggle, right? It's not likE he makes his own teletype machine and start sending messages to the rest of the world and I could see how it went. Like I've, you know, I've been around in business enough where I can see that there's, there are forces at play where they probably went in, they were saying, you know what, I get all that shit, but you better put a love interest in this. Well, isn't that a lot of ways similar to your experiences in hollywood when you were doing your first show?

Speaker 3:          02:41:48       Yeah. You kNow, I mean, uh, what was it the wild within wild within. Yeah, when I, when I saw your first show and then I spoke with you about it and you know, they're telling me like they were trying to like let him loose loose and then you would shoot it. They had like a captain. He was just, it was an early cOnversation I had where I was trying to explain it. I'm like, no one's pretty hard, like a lot of times stuff doesn't show up. And the guy who I later became friends with and have a lot of respect for him, but he was new to huntington, was not, was not new to television, was new to hunting. And he would say, well, that's why they have animal wranglers. And that's Just one of the, you know, one of the early conversations we had, I wound up liking quite a bit.

Speaker 3:          02:42:22       But yeah, it was, uh, I think that one of the things that gets reality television in trouble, there's a fake anecdote I often tell about about two kinds of producers, right? Like a, it was a producer who would say to you, how would you do that? Whatever you're doing. And you'd Say, well, I'd take this really small little knife and I'd very carefully make a really delicate little incision right here. And they would say, great film that. And then there are ones that would go, but could you use a machete? And I think that, um, you know, and those are two types of, you know, and luckily in my career I've now I'm able to surround myself with people who, who liked that little small knife.

Speaker 1:          02:43:14       Well, you got very fortunate in that you went to the sportsmans channel, which gives you essentially free reign.

Speaker 3:          02:43:19       Yeah. They don't mess with us. Yeah. That, that I bought. I just loved working with them in the way that they've just allowed us to make a, just allowed us to do our own thing. Um, there's a lot of trust there and there's a leap of faith there and I'd like to think we haven't let them down. But um,

Speaker 1:          02:43:35       well you are definitely onto that trust and I think that's one of the reasons why your shows the first show of its kind to be on netflix. And uh, I think it's educating a lot of people. It's not just a show that's a show preaching to the choir, you know, it's not just a show for enthusiasts, it's a, it's a show that gives you an insight and a perspective into it. I think you're the guy to do it too, because I think the ethics that you carry, you know, like here's an important distinction, like even though it's legal to use walkie talkies and certain things in some places you don't want to use them. And I had this thought the other day because I was listening to this podcast and these guys were discussing different lenses for optics. They're comparing spotting scopes and they started talking about walkie talkies and they got it. It became this combination of things that guys love because god is love like gadgets and tech things. It became tech talk and and gadget talk mixed with hunting and I, I started thinking, I'm like, well, when does this end? Does it end with drones? Does it not end? Does it end with what? I mean, what if we come up with something

Speaker 3:          02:44:48       pharmacy appearing? It's ending with drones. Yeah, it's ending with drones,

Speaker 1:          02:44:52       but it does if knowing. Absolutely. What's sending a drone up in the air, it flies over. Okay. The herd of elk is, you know, a mile to the left. We can't see him from here because there's a ridge over us, but we can. We know where the wind is. We can hook around this way and get those animals that is in, in your eyes, that's cheating.

Speaker 3:          02:45:14       Well, categorically at this point it's illegal. Is it illegal in every state, but every state where every state, the state were the states where it matters because of having like open country it is or is becoming and it's not. You're not going to be. It's not gonna happen. I mean so many states out and for I think 13 or 14 states have banned drones, but it's great that they got out in front of. It sort of came out of nowhere, right? Two way. Communications is something where a lot of, uh, you know, some states, and I'm not talking like liberal softy states, man, Montana, Alaska, you can't use too many communications. The hunt because they decided that that's where you draw the line because they might have even discussed and the ethics thing, but it's something that goes back to the great conservationist and writer, elder leopold, where he had said we spend a lot of energy improving the pump but not the well, so we have a resource, you know, we have, we have a resource of wild animals and if you just work on improving ways to, to pump them out without also working on ways of improving the well and having there be a stable population, um, you're gonna drain the damn well.

Speaker 3:          02:46:24       So when we're looking at as emerging technologies come out wrong, you, you have to constantly ask yourself, um, with increAsed efficacy, like if we get it where technology, it means that every hunter is always successful. What will that wind up meaning for wildlife populations, it's not going to mean a diminishment of wildlife populations. It will mean a tremendous diminishment of hunter opportunity. You have a lot, like a lot of over the counter public land. Elkanns constantly. American west are about 10 or 20 percent success rates. So you give out 100 licenses, you're going to kill about 15 out. This is a generalization, but generally you give them a hundred guys an opportunity. If you have success rates at 100 percent, how many tags are you given out? 15, right? Yeah. So it's, it's not, it's like you're talking about ethics, but you're also talking about access and privilege but aren't for you personally, aren't you also talking about the way it makes you feel?

Speaker 3:          02:47:27       Yeah, because. Well, I think it makes everybody feel that way. Guys that shoots up behind high fence, they don't. Defense has never in the picture. And guys at radio hunt, the goddamn radios are never in the photographs. Right, right. You see a guy standing there with 10 people in the photo and you know that nine of them were up on glass and tits with radios radio and the guy in, but they sure should, aren't wearing the headsets and the picture. So they kind of get to that. They're not proud of it. Like I would like one way to to, to look at things for me is I'm like, you know, is it something that you kind of tuck away when it's all over? Is this something that celebrated? Yeah. A guy killed south with the bowl. That's some bitch. And beau is laying on top of the animal always. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. The guy with the gun maybe. Maybe not. Who knows? He doesn't really care. It doesn't matter. Yeah. He's like, yeah, maybe I might put my gun in there. It might not. That's not the point of. Gary would never lays out a walkie talkie on top of the bowl. That's very. It takes a photograph. That's very true. Very true.
