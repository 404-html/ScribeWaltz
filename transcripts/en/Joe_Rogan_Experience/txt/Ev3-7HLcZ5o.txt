Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Five four, three, two day Ruben lays gentlemen, how are you buddy? What's up bro? Dude, I haven't seen you a while. The last time we saw each other, it was just now, but before that was right before the election. The day before the world changed. Squirrely tourette's. Squirly. Doesn't that literally, it seems like a lifetime ago. Not even a lifetime ago. It's like a different life for me. I think it's a different life for you. Think about how much has changed for both of us in that time, but it seems like another planet, like an alternate universe of the day before the election. It is in a lot of ways, right? I mean people are, the world's going, well, people are, the world's trying to find its footing. Yes. You know, it's a lot of craziness. I hate to tell you jail. Oh, but you are a little piece of the finding of the footing because people are finding the footing.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       You know, I'm on tour repeaters in right now. I just got in this morning from Atlanta and it's like there is, without being hyperbolic, there is some kind of awakening happening right now. People are kinda getting their shit together. They're kind of sorting out things there through long form conversations like we're all having and all these people that we're now connected with. There's something happening where people are going. There's another way to make sense and let me figure out what that is. It doesn't mean we have all the answers and I can sure as hell no I don't and I don't think you think you do either, but we're at least giving them a little room to figure it out and it's pretty cool. Well, the thing about Peterson that's been fascinating is how many people misrepresent what he says to try to frame him him in a way that makes him evil and mix their position seem more ethical or more moral or better or more intellectual.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       There's so many articles being written about him almost on a daily basis. It is misrepresent what he's saying. It's epic bullshit. I mean weird. That's all it is. These guys want clicks. That's all they want. I mean, I've, we've done about 20 shows in the last six weeks or so, bounced around from Nashville and Houston and Atlanta and Chicago and everywhere else, the crowds have been incredible. It's, it's probably split, you know, first off they always go, well, it's angry white men. That's the main thing. It's all angry white men. Now, first off, let's say it was all angry white men there, that in and of itself doesn't mean it's bad. Let's say there was like a really disaffected group of angry white men that really felt like by their masculinity had been compromised or they couldn't get jobs or they didn't feel good about their lives.

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       Like if there was someone talking to them that was helping them, that would actually be good. But let's just put that aside, right. Cause they don't mean it in a positive way. So they say it's all angry white. But now I can tell you it's about 60, 40 male to female, roughly. Um, at Jordan shows Jordan shows. Yeah. And it's, do you think that's like dates that reluctantly go along with men? Like right. There are some, I mean there will be guys that you will, he's actually, usually girls will come up to me after and they'll go, you know, he's a big fan of you guys are, he loves Jordan are he loves you or Blah Blah Blah, and I'm just here. But then they all have a great time. I mean I'm telling you, this thing has been insane. Love

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       Fest. I know you saw the video that Jordan posted last night. It was his birthday last night. We were at, where the hell was I? Atlanta, the Tabernacle in Atlanta, you know, almost 3000 people singing happy birthday to him. We brought out this freaking stuffed lobster and a and a piece of meat cause he's on this crazy meat diet now and it's like, it's an endless love fest. Every street. We walked down, people high five and us saying hi. We did a little meet and greet impromptu thing at the Lincoln memorial and about a hundred people showed up just out of nowhere. And it's like these people are just trying to figure shit out. They're not white supremacists. They're not all right. They don't hate women. It is literally nothing that they say because they want clicks. And the way they get clicks, I mean, you know, the way they get clicks because they saved the absolute reverse from the truth.

Speaker 2:          00:03:44       It's not that they lie a little bit like a little lie. I think nobody would even pick up on it. We don't think that's what they do. I think they're just misrepresenting. I don't think they're, they're saying the APPS, the opposite of the truth. They're just, they just look there. They're finding these little categories like homophobia, transphobia. I'm not a homophobe, he's on tour with a gay guy. He's not a transplant. There are trans people that show up there. And I, and I discussed it with him every freaking night. I asked, you know, we do. So I basically do like 15 minutes of stand up, up top. He does an hour and a half and then we do a q and a together. Um, and we bring out all of these things and every night to clear it up and sometimes I'll have people bro bust out their phones and I'll be like, why don't you guys record this tonight?

Speaker 2:          00:04:24       Let's get it out on twitter where he takes down the alt right because he hates the identity politics of the right as much as the identity politics of the left. I mean, I think, I think the reason we all focus on the thing of the left is because it has encompassed culture in media and politics and what you're allowed to say and, and uh, universities and all of that. So it makes more sense to focus on that. The little sliver of it that's on the right. Yeah. It's Shitty. It's horrible. You should not look at your skin color as some great thing that makes you better or, but it's sort of right thing, is racism always a right thing? Like, oh, not at all racists, right? No. I think the left is far more racist than the right at this moment. Yeah. Why do you think that?

Speaker 2:          00:05:02       Because identity politics is based in racism. You happen to be white. I know nothing about you by the color of your skin. I know about Joe Rogan because I watched the show, I listened to the show. We've done this several times and we can for the hours that we're going to sit here now we can dive as deep into any issue and that's the only way that I can sensibly judge you. But the idea that you will look at people that you would look at a black person, a black person will be sitting there or a Muslim person will be sitting there are transports and sitting there and you'd go, I have even an inkling of what you think because of that immutable characteristic that is actual racism that is prejudging, right? Judging first before you know somebody. So I have a much bigger issue with that because that has infected everything in American society right now. The identity politics of the right, that this should be a white ethno state or something like that. But it's that of course it's nonsense. That's not really the identity politics of the right.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       Well, I don't think the left is necessarily that way either. I mean, I think the identity politics, there's a real issue, right, with people that only identify with other women, women that only identify with women and don't care about men. There's a real issue with people that are a only American. They don't care about the rest of the world. This is like, there's all these weird groups, but I think we run into problems when we start saying, oh, it's the left. It's doing this as the right that's doing this. I think it's just tribal. It's just this weird thing that human beings tend to gravitate towards. Crow tribes for sure. And look, we can we, can I talk about things usually from a little more of a political lens then I think you do. So yes, of course. Ultimately it is tribalism. However you want to parse that tribalism, right?

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       So yes, the law, and I say this all the time, but the left right thing doesn't make that much sense anymore. You're either basically, you're basically for freedom. You're for the individual to live freely, however they see fit or you believe that the government should engineer things and that there should be central planning so that people, I think that's always shitty thinking. I think that people that say that the government should engineer things, they're just looking for a solution and then they think the government should handle it. So yeah, I think we should pay more taxes or is that going to go, it's going to go to the government and what is it you're agreeing with me? Yeah, and a lot of, oh okay. I thought you said no, no me. Your thinking. I mean their shift, they're having shitty thinking. It's like this idea that the government's going to fix it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:22       The government is filled with people like we don't have our own individual solutions so we don't have a solution as human. Just as human beings, objective human beings looking at problems. Why would we ever think that elected officials, these, these people that are for the most part full of shit, like they're just trying to say whatever they can say that's going to appease both the special interest groups and the lobbyists and the people that are helping them get into place and people are going to vote for them and you know, and then just sort of like skirt around all the other issues that are controversial to the point where they can get into office named three politicians that you really like. I don't know any of them. I mean, I know. All right. Then Gary Johnson who is like, who I like him too and I've heard it before, but he was the worst possible libertarian candidate, you know, who's the best libertarian candidate?

Speaker 1:          00:08:10       I mean ran. Paul should be, if he really had the balls to be what he is going to learn how to stuff it takedown. Yeah, right. He's got a lot right guys coming at you again, you got to figure out a way to sprawl. You could do, you could do two hours with him and he'd be a lot better and a lot of ways, but he should be the guy but he doesn't have the balls to do it because he wants to maintain being a Republican senator in Kentucky and he's not going to do it if he has to leave the party. But if, but I've seen a major shift I think in Republicans or at least conservatives or generally people on the right, whatever you want to call that thing. There is a massive libertarian streak that is alive in them right now, which is why most of the people that I liked these days that I get along with that I think are fair and decent and honest are pretty much libertarian.

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       Define Libertarian, libertarian, so libertarian or classical liberal. This is what I get more than anything else. Cause I say I'm a classical liberal, which basically means you believe in the individual. The sovereignty of the individual is the simple most important thing. It is your life. It is your duty to do what you see fit. The government is supposed to do pretty much nothing other than protect your life. So it's supposed to have an army and police and stuff like that and then really just laissez faire economics and that. And then the difference between classical liberal and Libertarian is how far do you want to go with the government. So I think there is some utility for the state, but the more I do this, the more I have these conversations and I talked to ann caps and real libertarians and all that. I find that hard to defend the state at almost any level at this point.

Speaker 2:          00:09:42       But I do think that because I don't want to live in Mad Max fury road just yet, although we may be heading there, I still will defend the state at some level. But I would say everything should be local. We have an incredible experiment here with 50 states. If your state taxes too high, move, go somewhere else. If your state doesn't have good education, you can go somewhere else. If you don't like the weather somewhere. But the second we make everything federal, and this is what, it's not just the left. This is what people who were using lazy thinking that you referred to, they think we should just have one law that we should all live exactly the same. No matter where we are geographically, no matter what our religion or what. However we set our set of uses, that is a nightmare. That is a nightmare for a totalitarian state because if, if the federal government, if one government controls everything, guess what?

Speaker 2:          00:10:26       If you don't like it, you got to leave the country. You know, go to Mexico, go to Canada, you probably won't like it. They're really referring to like in terms of like you want subtle laws. Well because you want states' rights you should care about is state, right? So for example, we live in California. We are taxed out the fucking Wazoo. I bought a house last year. It's my first time at 41 years old that I owned property in America. I made it. I own property. I don't have to tell you about my property taxes. They're insane. They're very high. They're absurdly, absurdly high. That's the price you pay for living in a spot where everybody wants to live. No, but that's it. That's the beauty, right? So like there's a trade off there. Now I could move to Texas and the property taxes would be way low and maybe because they don't tax as much the schools are and as good or a series of other things, but that's the beauty of the foot vote.

Speaker 2:          00:11:12       You can go. This is an experiment, this thing in American who's against that? Anyone that wants to keep giving more power to the federal government, which is pretty much everybody these days. Pretty much everybody in mainstream. Certainly all of the Democrats, all of you know the, the, the mainstream set of Democrats and the Bernie and the progressive crew. They would love for the federal government to control everything and that is an absolute nightmare. It's an absolute no control. Everything like how so? Like they want to control all economics, department of Education, a configure out, all the environmental regulations, all of those things. I would kick back everything to the states, let the states decide. And if you don't like it, get going. I mean, that's, that's a beautiful thing. If you, if you really care about marijuana and you live in Alabama right now and it's not legal, guess what?

Speaker 2:          00:11:59       Go to Colorado, go to California. I mean that, that's, that's how you'll influence things because you can move your family, your value, whatever you bring to your community in your life. I mean, think about it right now. If California just kept taxing higher and higher and kept screwing up a lot of this, a ton that's going wrong in the state, eventually Joe Rogan might be like, you know, I just built this freaking kick ass new studio here. I'm now paying, I don't know, hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes and all this stuff. You might want to try it somewhere else where they're going to tax you less. But that's the beauty of the thing. You don't have to leave the country. So the, the federal government should pretty much do nothing. It should make sure we're not warring with each other that the states aren't warring that's about, and then protect the borders. Beyond that. It doesn't have to do a lot. Leave it to the states. Let look if you had a problem here, you know you're a sewage leak right outside, you want the federal government to deal with that or do you want the local municipality to deal with that? You want everything to be as local as possible because that's how you'll influence things. And that's how you as an individual will be empowered. And that's all I have.

Speaker 3:          00:13:01       No, I mean, hearing what you're saying, but I'm just not hearing this, this clamoring for the government to take care of everything. I mean, you hear, you heard a little bit from Bernie, you know, but I just think again, a lot of that is like, it's not doing it now. So the idea is that the solution would be if the government takes over and we take more rich people's taxes, you know, and he will spout off about income inequality and take that money and redistribute it. And then somehow or another that's going to fix everything. But it's not, you're just going to make government bigger. You're going to have more jobs, you're gonna have more jobs in government, red tape, more bureaucrats, more bullshit. So you're agreeing with, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:13:37       Yeah, for the most part. I mean that's the thing. It's like they look, you want to give free college education, everyone first off, it's not free. I mean that it's just, this is just stupid lazy thinking to say it is free. It's not free. You got to pay the janitor and you got to pray the professors and everyone else,

Speaker 3:          00:13:49       well they mean free for students. And the, the idea of being that our taxes instead of going towards the military, they would go towards education.

Speaker 2:          00:13:57       Sure. So they should at least be honest and say that because a certain amount of people just hear free and you just think it's free but it's not free. You obviously have to pay for it. But also we're moving into an economy where robots are taking over automa automation is taking over, go to, you know what I think Mcdonald's said within five years it's all going to be ipads. Go to half the Mcdonald's and you know, a fast food places in airports. Now it's all ipad. So if you're, the more you're going to the government, which doesn't do anything right or well or efficiently, the more they say, okay, private business, you're going to have to spend more on employees. Well then all these businesses are just going to figure out ways which they should do. I mean that's ingenuity, right? They will figure out ways to save costs, save expenses, and then less people will be hired and then at the same time we're going to be subsidized and all of these people to go to college. We're often in college, they're learning nothing and gender studies and, and all of these other crazy classes and we're just going to have this set of people who have no real skills

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       and we're going to set up businesses that will never want to hire them because the government is going to tell them how much to pay. I mean, you have employees here, you don't, you pay them what you think is fair and if they don't want to do it, they don't have to. But imagine if the government came in and was like, Joe, you're going to have to pay your guys this amount. It's ridiculous. Well think how many people would love to work for you for free. I'm sure you get emails every day as I do. I don't want to, I don't stalker. Yeah. I don't want people to work for me for free. But like the interns, I don't like the idea of it silly. But you're a small business owner. I mean that's the fact. And you should be able to do whatever with your business and your property that you want.

Speaker 4:          00:15:27       It's as simple as that. I'm, I think we get real, there's a lot of cliche terms and one of them is like that people who go to college or studying gender studies or lesbian dance theory, but how much of that is really happening? And then the man, it's very small. It does exist in some weird states. Like I'm sure you're aware of that lady who was the professor from Fresno State who, uh, got in trouble recently. So many of them. Which one was his? Some big lady was talking a bunch of shit. It's just there and she said she could never get fired. They didn't fire that lane. Yeah, there's a lot of them. I mean there's a lot of really wacky professors out there that do have tenure. Yeah. That woman was tweeting out some bananas stuff and she has tenure and she's not going to go anywhere.

Speaker 4:          00:16:12       There's universities all over the country. They're constantly teaching kids. I mean, for the most part, these are there. It's a small percentage. It's a small percentage, but they have way over influence on the amount of people. They have scared the majority into silence. I mean, I don't know how often you're doing colleges these days, but I don't do it. I'm doing them all the time and what I find, so I did this thing at University of New Hampshire. We posted, saw it, so look, they first off, what they did was they were supposed to be about 300 people there. So they, at first, because of the protestors, the school said we can't secure a room. So thinking what are they protesting you about? Well, I was split technically I was supposed to be there that day with candace owens and Charlie Kirk from turning point and we were going to talk about cultural appropriation and you know, some of the hot hot button stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:16:58       So I don't even know that they all were there to protest me specifically. But anyway, that day was the day that can, and Charlie ended up on TMZ with Kanye, so they bailed on me and just left the left me for the wolves. They were on Tmz with Kanya. We've been just a couple of weeks ago. They, Kanye showed up at the TMC offices with them. So they just showed up with him and they blew off there. Yeah, they're all good appearance. Yeah, it's all right. When was it was me. It was me and university of New Hampshire or Kanye and TMZ. Yeah. But they had a schedule like they're supposed to be there and they just decided not to run again. So the people like paid to have you come. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And they were supposed to be paid to go to come to think of it.

Speaker 4:          00:17:37       I didn't get more money for this. That is ridiculous. The whole thing's ridiculous that they would just blow that off. It's like, that's a Gig. You don't blow off a gig because Kanye wants to go on the gossip show. Yeah. But now you're fucking stupid. Or what? Now you're talking to me like as a comic. Good. It's like, yeah, we wouldn't do that. It's just a different, you don't blow off a Gig. Yeah. It's just a different, but come to see you don't just decide, oh, this gig is better for me right now. Yeah. I'm just curious. With Kanye on TV, Hi Harvey Harvey that they spent time with Harvey Levin instead of me. Well, he seems like a nice enough guy. Yeah. This business is a little shady. Yeah. But the whole thing behind it is you don't, you don't cancel a gig because he got another Gig that you think is better for you last minute.

Speaker 4:          00:18:20       Like that's terrible. What's that phrase, man? The show must go on. Yeah, it's supposed to go on. Yeah, for sure. So I saw you getting, uh, was that the lady that the coins, the jar, they brought noise makers. They were slamming on shit. They were screaming things where it's so ridiculous. Like you would let them talk and they didn't have any to say. I mean the best part of this. So first off, 300 people supposed to be there. They say we can't secure a room on campus. So think about what a defeat that is. So this is where you might say, okay, it's a minority of students, but think how they affect the majority. That meant that the University of New Hampshire, it's a pretty solid school in the live free or state live free or die state. Right. They could not secure because I'm showing up a room on their campus.

Speaker 4:          00:19:01       So that's already a massive loss. When you, when you say could not secure you mean safety wise, he said they could not secure it. Safety wise. There were too many threats, whatever the hell that means. Twitter chat or other non, so candice and the other guy are gone. So it's just you? Yeah, the, the Gay Libertarian Guy. And they're like, too dangerous. Too dangerous, too crazy. Like what is he going to say? We're going to, we're going to have to silence him. Yeah. Well I flipped the script on their heads. I mean, that's what it comes down to. Like they don't know what the fuck to make of me because I don't play their game, but I'm just doing what I think is right. I don't think I'm a freaking rocket scientist. I don't think I'm some massive intellectual. I think I'm someone that can communicate these ideas pretty well.

Speaker 4:          00:19:41       And uh, and hopefully we'll talk about it. But I'm back in, stand up now like I'm doing, I'm just doing what I think is right on this planet while I'm here. That's it. And so when you do these speeches, what do you do when you go to these colleges? So, so I get up there, so they move it from this, from the university 300 seat room. They move it to a hockey rink of 7,500 seats. So think how absurd this absurd, this is 300 people and they're in a, how many people are in the audience? 300 people. Oh God. So apparently they didn't apparently like another hundred supporters of mine showed up, but they didn't even let them in. And even though they were roughly 7,000, 100 empty seats, why wouldn't they let him in? I Dunno. Cause at that point security starts, everything just gets whacked.

Speaker 4:          00:20:20       I mean this happens at every college thing. Like nobody knows who's in charge anymore, you know, it's just like this big cluster fuck. So anyway, so they put up a step and repeat with the turning point symbol behind me and I'm doing my thing. But there's a freaking Sam bony back there. I'm like, what the hell am I doing? Like this is ridiculous. And turning point is that conservative think tank things. They're the largest conservative, uh, college. A nonprofit. So why do they have that behind you? Well, cause he was sponsored by them. Charlie. Charlie runs turning points. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       Yeah. But he didn't even have the fucking show up. It was either that that then goes, they were, I sit literally, I stand there and literally in front of, you know, 6,000 seats. Seriously. Why? Yeah. I mean, that's for, for them to figure out why they did that. But Anyway, 7,000 empty seats. I do my thing. I talked for about a half hour and I knew they were a certain, you know, 250 of those kids were there to listen and agree or disagree. I mean, think about it. These, this is the conservative group. They're bringing a gay married guy who's pro pod, who's pro euthanasia, who's against the death penalty for reforming the prison system. Uh, I'm pro choice. Like I could go on and on about the liberal crowd that you and I don't get anymore. And they're, they're, they're applauding. What do they, what are they mad at you for?

Speaker 2:          00:21:30       Well, so it's not those guys, man. It's, they're mad. They, if they don't know, they just want you to bow forever. They don't come to listen. They want to silence. That's it. They just want to silence you about like what is it that they oppose that you're saying Joe, I w I literally, every time I they would scream or they'd start robotically, you know, they set timers and then they robotically chant. We're not the problem or just some other nonsense. We're not, we are not the problem we are. I'd go, I'd look at them right in the eye and be like, I'm standing right in front of you. Do you have a question for me? Is there something that I said that upset you? Any of that? And they can't respond. They, I mean they just can't respond because they're not there to exchange ideas.

Speaker 2:          00:22:09       They believe they are oppressed and they boo. I mean, look, I always go up there, what do I say at every college thing I go, think about it. Do you think you have it worse than, than your grandparents? I want everyone in this room to think about your grandparents right now and 99.9% of people in America right now have it better than their grandparents had it. I'm sure you have it better than your grandparents had. I have better than my grandparents had it. All of these kids, they're at University of New Hampshire studying whatever the hell they want to study. They have it better than their grandparents. But that the power of thinking that you're oppressed, the power of thinking that the world is warped against you is it's a drug. It is truly a drug. And one of the things on that, so it turns out, did you see the exchange I got in with the Trans Woman?

Speaker 2:          00:22:49       Yes. So it turns, so this trans woman is telling me to go fuck myself and whatever she's saying and screaming along with everybody we'll ship set about. Well cause I mentioned the Jordan Peterson Pronoun thing and I said, look, I want trans people to be treated equally under the law. I want trans people to be respected. I hope you find, I literally said to her looking right at her, I hope, I hope you find someone that loves you and your life. I mean all, I want you to be as equal and happy as anybody else on this planet. That is what I want for you. She's still telling me to go fuck myself. It turns out, I didn't know this till weeks later. I found this out about a week ago. She's a professor of gender studies at University of New Hampshire. So she's literally trying, you have a professor that is part of the protesters and she's live tweeting the thing about, all right, Dave Ruben. I mean, so that's where, when, when people think it's this little thing, it's, yeah, it's this little thing that's, that's metastasizing and spreading like a cancer. And I truly believe that identity politics, that this thing, I think is

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       the biggest threat to the west and to freedom that exists. Did you communicate with her at all? I communicated her from with my mic and then was there, did she exchange say what? She has a problem. So she kept yelling at me and people can have a video of this. Oh yeah, it's there. I don't know where it's probably maybe an hour in herself. Um, I saw it and I just was like, oh poor, what's he dealing with? I got a lot of pity for that, which was good. It was like, you know what, I was shaking the jar coins. I was like, Oh, you know, it was really funny is that I realized that there's one, so there's one moment and I never lost my cool cause it's like it's a bunch of kids yelling and as long as they're not going to take a Samurai sword out and stab me or anything, then it, then it's fine.

Speaker 4:          00:24:26       But there was one moment where they just kept going and going. So I sarcastically said it. I was like, guys shut the fuck up. And it got a big laugh and then I repeated it a couple times, but then I realized that when the school newspaper wrote about it, they said, and then Dave Ruben told them to shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up is very different than shut the fuck up. So that was my one, my one lesson in there, it seems like is the answer. She didn't want anything from me. She wanted me to be thrown out for doing that because if you are doing that, you're, you're disrupting a performance. I mean, I'm sure you would have a q and a with those people. Right. He'd be happy to do that. Do it. And if they're a half hour, I opened it up for q and a so let's do the rest of the last hour.

Speaker 4:          00:25:11       But you didn't even get a chance to get to that with her. Right. She was already yelling at know and then I think I even said to her, I know I did it. Several people. I'm pretty sure she was too. Do you have a question for me? And I think her last thing was your, I hate you or something. Something to that effect. I mean this is a professor should be, she should be disqualified for teaching. She's an a logical thinker. This is not what you want raising your children. Yeah. But essentially that's what they are. They're still children. You got this fucking dummy who can't focus enough to have a coherent argument that they're yelling out in the middle of your performance. And by the way, for the record, the uh, authorities or the police or the campus safety, whatever it was, did at one point try to have some people sit down and be quiet.

Speaker 4:          00:25:54       And I was like guys don't worry about it. Cause it's like yeah, I guess we could escalate it to that point. I didn't even want this video to be released when they videotape this. I did not want it to be released cause I don't want to add fuel to the fire. I'm trying to fix some of these products as part of the problem. Right. Is that this becomes something that they know that they can get a video of if they go to your next performance and interrupt you. Yeah. But you know what? I don't think they want one person over to their side. I don't think one screaming lunatic who, who did not come to respect me even though I was there to respect them. I don't think they want anybody. I think I actually want a lot of people to my side. And I think, I mean I know it cause I've received tons of emails about it.

Speaker 4:          00:26:29       I know what you're saying, but I don't think it's about winning to your side. I think it's about other lunatics that realize that there's an opportunity to get attention if they go to your show and yell things out. Yeah, well that's why we ended up putting the video up because a couple of them would put up these little clips, very selectively edited that made it seem like I was doing things that I wasn't like I was silencing them or just some other nonsense. So then finally I was like, all right, if this is the way the Internet is and it just is, then we'll just put up the whole thing on edited. Even though I had 10 minutes before, I said, guys, don't even record this. I said, don't even record this, because because Charlie and candice hadn't showed up and I was like, it's ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          00:27:03       I got 7,000 empty seats behind me. But then once people start playing that game, you can either just be the bitch, which I refuse to be, or you can fight back. Yeah. It's a weird place to be because you know what they're doing and they're essentially just trying to rile you up. And if they're not willing to have a real dialogue with you, they're just yelling, fuck Dave Rubin. That really should disqualify you from being a teacher. I mean that's, that's the worst way to communicate. You're demonstrating that you're thinking sucks and that you want to teach about gender studies, but yet you know, you, you, you're interrupting a comp and you're trying to claim transphobia or whatever the fuck he's, she is trying to claim she, it's a she right? She, she's a trans woman, but she was a man not as a woman. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:27:50       Yeah. By the way, I treated her with complete respect. Like that's the thing, they, they truly, they want you, they want to put their foot on your neck and have you stay there forever. And that's why every time now that somebody's mainstream writes something about you, half the time they're calling you a conservative cause they don't know what the fuck to do with this guy who's talking about drugs and all the crazy shit you're talking about. All the time, but also you're woke enough to actually identify there is a problem here with what's happening in the mainstream. So they can't categorize us in any sensible way. So in a weird way, especially because me and you also, because of the nature of what we do, we sit from people that are a little scary. You know what I mean? Like you've had Jones on, I've had molyneux on I, you know, I had certain a bit John at the, at the beginning, and I'm sure you've had plenty of other controversial people and it's like, so they, there's an odd way that they want to look at the two of us more than other people because we, by the nature of our jobs, by the nature of how we exist, that's a threat.

Speaker 4:          00:28:50       If you want to control the way everybody thinks. Hmm. Yeah. You're not supposed to give people a platform. That's what I keep hearing. Yeah. So, so what's your policy on that? Because that seemed to be the, after this idw intellectual dark web article came out, that was the big thing that people kept hitting me on. It's like you don't want any gatekeeping. You'll talk to anybody and first off, I won't talk to anybody, but I'm a general believer that you let ideas out there, but what is wrong with talking to people and it's always been what people have done their, they've always been interviews with controversial people. Guess what happens when you stop talking to people? Yeah, not good. Yeah. That's when shit goes down. But there's a lot of people that don't want us talking to people. I mean I look, a lot of people were pissed you, you smoke pot with Jones, right? You smoke. Not with Alex. I watched it. It's bananas. I watched all the games and it's like, look, that guy has done some seriously twisted crazy shit. There is no doubt about it. The Sandy Hook

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       stuff, and I didn't know about the sandy hook stuff by the way, before we did the podcast, I knew that he believes a bunch of stupid conspiracies that are genuinely just dismissed, but I didn't know that he was saying that those kids never died or that it was going to change the equation for you. Yeah, it would have been mad at him and I would have talked about it right away. I would've been like, what the fuck are you talking about? This kids are dead. Like there's a guy that was, uh, it was a terrible story about a guy who was a conspiracy theorist before sandy hook. Then his kid died at Sandy Hook and a bunch of people were threatening him and calling him a crisis actor and saying his kid never died. And then he realized how insane it really is. People are looking for conspiracies everywhere, man.

Speaker 3:          00:30:20       I keep hearing them now about Anthony Bordain that bordain was going to expose some child pedophile ring and that's why they suicided him. It's fucking stupid, man. Without going down and fully on that road. There is one odd thing about the bordain thing, which is just a few weeks ago, didn't he tweet some odd thing about having the, the, he's met the Hillary Clinton like machine or something and it's wrong. And he was talking about, no, no, I'll tell you exactly what he was talking about. The same people that Harvey Weinstein used would that were, um, Israeli, what does it black cue or some shit. See what you find the tweet because [inaudible] he was basically saying that, uh, Donald Trump's people use the same people that Harvey Weinstein used Israeli intelligence group too. You know, there was something that Harvey had done to his victims where he was trying to silence them by scaring them with these, uh, these, you know, Israeli mercenary type folks don't go down that conspiracy.

Speaker 3:          00:31:24       That's not what he was doing with me. He was just saying, God is just standing there like he's got, he had some crazy thing with his girlfriend. We was like fully invested in her battle with Harvey Weinstein, you know, so that's what he tweeted about. But it was, it's like they would kill him for that. Like that's so fucking stupid. Yeah. Well what about Ronan Farrow? What about all the people that wrote the story? What about all the people that are accusing him of rape like this? The guy's going broke. Two d people don't understand that Harvey Weinstein's businesses going bankrupt. He's fucked. He's going to jail. It's, the walls are caving in. He doesn't even have his business anymore. I ran a mercenary to go kill a chef. I mean, this is fucking stupid. This is stupid thinking and you know, look, it's not, it's not that it's impossible for someone who will want to hire someone to kill someone.

Speaker 3:          00:32:09       But I don't think that's what happened. I think he killed himself. And I think it's a terrible, terrible tragedy. And I think it's really disrespectful to have all these dumb speculative ideas because there's sport in conspiracies. It's a sport. It's a game. There's a hobby that people have. And looking to fucking, I'm looking for the truth bro. I'm looking at fucking close the gaps. This is what it is, man. It's the Illuminati. The second you think you got it right here. Um, okay. Here it is. Hold on. Scroll up. I am in no way Hillary Quinn. I've been on the receiving end of her operatives wrath and it ain't fun. Right? And that's from about a month ago. Those operatives, Oh, here we go. Now you're going to fill some gaps for me. Her operatives wrath. Okay. Know, but he was, the thing is Hillary Clinton was before the track, before the scandal happened, there's a lot of photos of Hillary Clinton hanging out with Weinstein.

Speaker 3:          00:33:05       Yeah. Oprah hanging out with them out. Everybody cuddle and Meryl Streep, Meryl Streep, cuddling up with them. Like the whole thing is there's people that are complicit for sure in one way or another. So after everything you just said and knowing that Joanne's plays that game a little bit, would you have him on again? If I had them on again, that would be the first thing I would talk about. You know, I'm, I'm, I've been friends with Alex since 1998 I've known him for a long time. I don't think he's a bad guy, but I think he's very wrong about a lot of things. He's very misguided about a lot of things and I think he loves conspiracies. There is a bunch of people in this country that love to make, they will have to connect the dots and find conspiracies in fucking everything. Everything that there is.

Speaker 3:          00:33:47       And sometimes the right and Alex has been right. Definitely. He's been right about a bunch of things. He was right about the World Trade Organization particular about when they were using agent provocateur tours to disrupt protests and make them violent protests by smashing windows. And he documented all of it and all these people were um, none of them were arrested. They were all, they all went to one safe house and then negotiated with the police. Then they were released, they all had military, um, military issue footwear. Like he's got all these, the, these documents from people that worked inside either police or law enforcement that say that there is a standard practice and this is existed for a long time and when you have peaceful protest and you can't do anything about it, the best way to do something about it is to take that peaceful protest and turn it non peaceful.

Speaker 3:          00:34:38       Yeah. The way you do that, he have these guys wear masks, they go in, they pretend they're one of the protesters. They start smashing windows, flipping over cars and then you move the cops and then they shut the protest down. So you essentially shut the peaceful protesters down by introducing non peaceful people and you, these are military operatives, these are people that are working for the government or working for whoever the fuck decides to pull the trigger on this and this is real. This has happened. There's a lot of people saying that's happening with the Tommy Robinson protests in the UK right now. See, I don't know enough about that story other than the fact that a bunch of people were mad at me on twitter. I'm not talking about talking about, I was like, I don't even know what that is. I'm going to back away. And then I saw it was something about he was, he was filming outside of a trial of Muslim pedophiles. Is that what these grooming gangs? Yeah, grooming gangs. Yeah. Tell me the whole story. So I don't want to do this as if I'm the freaking lawyer of the whole thing, but in effect he was filming outside of the trial for these, this group of men that are raping, they're to be like

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       12 and 13 year old girls. Basically they're on trial. He had already been on probation or something for something else. And you're not allowed to fill them outside the courthouse. So technically I suppose he is in jail now for the right reasons, but there's a lot of people that think he's not going to survive being in jail. And I look, I had the guy on my show. Have you ever, have you ever talked to him? No, I didn't know anything about him until this, this thing happened. I mean he has no, I know. It's a lot. It's all the time, man. No, I know you shit to do. I have kids. I don't know. You have to do occasionally just pick one and you're like, this one dude. There's a lot of them. I just don't know. I don't know what's going on. Like people who will, how come you're not calm and going?

Speaker 1:          00:36:14       And it was like, I don't even know about it. You fuck. I know. I love it. I love that. When you sit out something on twitter for six hours and people started screaming at you like that proves or you say anything about it. Yeah. Oh, you talk all day long about this and that, but then this comes up and you don't hear a word like I didn't even hear about some just now. Well, all right, let's not dive too deep in that so quick, but quick on Jones though. So I'm not actually in case you think I am. I'm not giving you shit for doing it. I'm just curious. I'm just curious because I think part of the article that that Barry Weiss wrote in the times about us, she was talking about that and there's a line in there where she said, you know, if you talk to these people, meaning Jones in Cernovich and Molyneux, that you're either cynical or stupid and in effect that was, that was a shot at me and you, it wasn't a shot at anybody else because they don't have to talk to other people.

Speaker 1:          00:36:58       You know what I mean? Like I love Eric and Bret Weinstein. What she said, yeah, we can probably find the line. But it was that you'd have to, I think it was, you'd have to be cynical or stupid. I would argue that, I mean, are you against that? Because I don't think you have to be, they're cynical or stupid. You just have to be a person talking to someone. Just because you're talking to someone doesn't mean you agree with them. Yeah. Idea of giving someone a platform. Like I'm going to have Ted nugent on the podcast. Right. You obviously endorse everything he's ever since. That's what you're saying. Right? If you haven't gone, that's, that's the only way to look at it again. That's it. How come you can't just talk to the guy and find out like, like candace owens, I don't agree with everything can to so and so's.

Speaker 1:          00:37:31       Yeah. Yeah. And this is nothing wrong with having a conversation like that. In fact, it's illuminating. What do you got here? Let's find that holding up the line. This is from the Times piece. Um, it says, it seems to me that if you're willing to sit across from an Alex Jones or Mike Cernovich and take them seriously, there's a high probability that you're either cynical or stupid. Now, if there's a reason for shorting the idw, it's the inability of certain members to see this as a fatal error. So that's, that's Rogan and Ruben. That's, that's what that's saying. Yeah, I get it. I'm just definitely things you can criticize about me, but, um, I have the list, right? But here's the thing. If you're saying I'm taking him seriously, I got Alex High and drunk and he started talking about interdimensional, chogm molesters. Like if anything, it showed people who he really is. Like, I've known that guy forever. I've partied with that dude. I've had them coming to my comedy shows. We've gotten fucked up and ran around the town and went to bars together back before everybody knew who he was too. We could go places. He's a fun guy. I don't believe everything he believes. I think he's silly

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       and a lot of ways, but I like a lot of people that I don't agree with. I don't have to agree with them. I didn't know about his Sandy Hook denial. If I did, it would have been the first thing I pressed him on when I talked to him. I wanted to do it with my crazy friend Eddie Bravo cause he believes every fucking conspiracy theory and I wanted to get him with Alex together and it was the cluster fuck that I hoped it would be it. It was a good thing about it is it showed people who Alex really is. It showed a side of him that you just don't get from his info wars show. You get to see him hi and laughing and drunk and pounded whiskey and fucking around and people are like, oh I could see why you like that guy. I can see why he's fun.

Speaker 3:          00:39:16       We had a good time together. That doesn't mean I endorse his opinions on things. And the idea that this is only red or white, that it is one or zero. It's binary. That's ridiculous. That's ridiculous. I just didn't, those two choices of adjectives I just thought were slightly like you could say defending our position, I think. I think she's doing a smart thing because she's a writer for the New York Times. I do have a lot of ridiculous people on and you have had ridiculous people on too. So what she's saying makes sense if you take them seriously. But she left that caveat. If you take them seriously. I do not take Alex Jones his opinion on interdimensional child molesters. Seriously, I don't his opinion, I don't want to smoke pot once a year just to test to see what George Soros has done with the marijuana. George Soros is giving the marijuana fucking dosage recommendations. Like that's pretty sure. Roseanne told me that too. Well, she thinks that that's another thing. I don't know what to do with her now. She thinks she apologized for that, but she said George Soros was a Nazi or something. He was captured by the Nazis. I mean he was like, okay,

Speaker 2:          00:40:18       well anyway, this, this gate piracies this gate keeping thing. I just think it's, it's interesting because if we're going to do what we do well at whatever level we do it, it's like we're going to have to talk to people that people don't like. And listen, look, Larry King, and this is the one thing I always say, it's like Larry King in the, in his heyday, think of the Prime Larry King, right? So 1991, CNN prime time, he could have, you know, uh, the Oj Simpson lawyers on, on Monday, he could have the cast show Seinfeld on Tuesday. He could have a magician on Wednesday. He could have Lucille ball if she was still alive on Thursday. And then, you know, George, the secretary of state or something. So no one thought he endorsed all of those ideas or I was friends with all those people. But I think somehow now, because, because this feels like your home. Mine is actually in my home the way we are. We're different, we're friendlier. We're not sitting here with note cards and with I fbs and it doesn't feel all produced and planned and all that. Even though I think we both do a hell of a fucking professional show that I think we're both really proud of. Um, I think because of that, they think,

Speaker 3:          00:41:23       ah,

Speaker 2:          00:41:24       now you're seeing the real them or something like that. Like it's a, it's something that I'm looking for Shit to complain about. Listen, I might be the easiest, right?

Speaker 3:          00:41:31       One of the reasons why I decided to do a podcast in the

Speaker 5:          00:41:33       first place cause I wanted to be able to do whatever I wanted. I wanted to be able to talk to my friends, have a good time fuck around. Along the line it became something different. And along the line it became not just talking to my friends, it became talking to people that are famous are interesting people or professors or writers or whoever it is. And I'm going to do whatever the fuck I want and that's why I'm doing this. I'm going to do whatever the fuck I want if I want to talk to. And if you don't like who I'm talking to, it's super simple. You just don't listen to that episode and go load rogen. You're all right now. All you have is alt right people. You think you're balanced up cause you have abby Martin on once a year. Like I just think I talked to people, you know I, I talked to a lot of people. There's, I like talking to people. I like talking to people I agree with and I can usually talk to people. I disagree with them. I get something out of that too.

Speaker 2:          00:42:19       Yeah. How, how aware are you of the thing that you just said there that like you did exactly what you set out to do. I don't know that you fully set out to do it this way, but you did it like this thing that you have created is so it, it is so what you wanted to do, whether you fully got it or not, but like you created it, it's awesome. Like I'm, I'm doing it at a, I think a lower level than you are, but I'm very aware of that. That like I somehow I hated what the system was offering and I was like, I gotta do something that feels right for me and from a different place. Did it? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:42:51       Cause I didn't come at it from a place like I need a Gig. I came at it from a place like, oh that'd be fun. Yeah. Fuck around. All the other side of things. I mean, I was already a professional stand up. I was already the commentator for the UFC. So this wasn't like when I came, I mean I did it for years for zero money for years because I just did it for fun. Like literally for fun dude, once a week have fun, sit down and have some comics over wood, smoke some pot, talk, some shit, have a couple of laughs. And then next thing you know I've got Graham Hancock on and you know, next thing you know I've got bordain on and I've got, you know, this professor and this author and the, and then it got weirder and weirder. But it just, to me it's just what's interesting.

Speaker 5:          00:43:33       Talk to people and I've never looked at it like, mmm. Like, like there's anything I have to do. I've never looked at it like that. I've, I've just always like, well this would be cool. Oh that guy sounds cool. Let me get him. This guy might be interesting. Oh, I like to talk to that dude. I want to find out about sleep. I want to find out about exercise and want to find out about dying. I want to find out about like, well how the fuck this finance is really where I want to talk to Peter Shift. Tell me how this works. How do you, what do you do well, how do you, how are you making your money? Like what it, what the fuck is going on in Puerto Rico? I this, this, I love talking to people, man. I, it's a fascinating thing to just to pick the brain uninterrupted with no distractions, to sit down and talk to someone for hours at a time. You learned a lot about yourself. You learn. Conversely, I'm much better, much better at talking to people and being sensitive and open minded and being considerate and listening. And that's a big thing. Like listening and communicating people, not just waiting

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       for my time to talk, but communicating with people. It's like, I feel like conversation is a lost art with a lot of folks and I've gotten way, way better at it over the whatever many years, nine years, nine years of doing this show. Yeah, I'm with, yeah, I mean I hear you all. I mean, I said at the beginning, but I just am doing what I think is right. Yeah, it's fun tactic. That's why when I see like the barrage of hate that I'll get online for this or that or just, you know, it's the same thing. It's just these people that just endless. You want to hate on everything and all that. It's too much noise. Oh, it's like if you're spending all day long hating on me, like if anything what I'm doing and he's the real problem here. You know what I mean? Like let's say I'm wrong on everything I say. Everything I said for the first 10 minutes about politics is wrong and we should have strong federal government and identity politics like even if that is, that's how it, it really is. Am I really the biggest problem here that people are all day long devoting twitter accounts, people that make accounts all day wrong. Fuck Dave room and Dave Rubin socks, Bro. I was like, what are you doing? Is that going on all the time?

Speaker 2:          00:45:31       People get laid anymore. I should know that that's happening. That's the part of the problem is you're, you're sort of indulging it, but paying attention to it. There's just too many people paying way less attention. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. You can't pay attention at all, dude. I was in a sensory deprivation tank just two, three days ago. Thanks to you. I've been doing it more. I was just in one of these infrared saunas. I'm doing it, you know, I'm doing all my August off the grid. I did it last August. Just literally nothing. I locked my phone in a safe, really locked my phone in a safe for 30 days. Do you call it the TV? No, nothing off the grid. August we had some Ruben Ruben esque something or other yellow dog. It's something like that, but I'm going to do it for now on.

Speaker 2:          00:46:09       I'm doing that every August. Really? Yeah. I am completely shutting down. Uh, I'm working on this book that I started last August and then, and then of course the year gets so crazy, but I have to pick it up again in August. I've been writing it now while I'm on the road. What's the book about? I mean, I don't want to go too far in it, but it in effect, it's when I did that prager u video about why I left the left. That's sort of the genesis of it, of sort of giving people a little bit of a roadmap. What does the prager u video, I'm not aware of it. So you're, you're familiar with pay for you, right? Well Dennis Prager, super conservative fellow. Yeah. So he does, he has this online university where they do these five minute cartoon videos on different ideas and they'll do on economics and foreign policy and race and religion, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 2:          00:46:50       And so I did one, it was a bout a year and a half ago, February of last year called, well, I had actually never said the phrase why I left the left, but I just talked about my frustrations with the left and why I believe in freedom and in liberty they titled It, why I left the left and it's chilly. The first, the first half hour when it dropped, I was pissed because I was like, man, did they just like blow my gig? Like I really felt at that time, I feel a little differently now that I was trying to fix the left from within or at least have conversations as someone that was one of these people. Like that's why I was focusing on the left. The all these liberals were, were my people. This is the thing that I grew up in. I always believed in. So the fact that they did that first half hour, I was like, fuck, like did I just get booted out?

Speaker 2:          00:47:35       And then quickly I realized that video went, went so viral, it's their number one viewed video on youtube that I was like, you know what, I have to just kind of embrace this. And, and again, it goes back to the labels thing. It doesn't really matter whether you left the three, whether you're a libertarian or classical liberal of the rest of it. Um, but anyway, that's the genesis of the book of like just how do you escape this sort of monolithic totalitarian thinking and how do you just be whoever you are and how does that, how does being an individual basically lead you to being happy? Because I think that's actually the only way that you can be happy. I think that that's it. You have, you know, it's the most cliche thing ever. It's what Peterson's telling these people every night, the thousands and thousands and thousands of people are showing up every night and he talks about the individual, he talks about stand up straight, you know, clean your room.

Speaker 2:          00:48:24       Like these things all sound silly at some level and the more that I'm with the guy, it's like he's giving these people saying that has just been so lost. Like so. Absolutely lost. People think you can just be pathetic. Blame the system. Everything else. It's somebody else's fault. You should be given shit. All of this stuff. And it's like ethic about every movie, any movie, whatever your 10 favorite movies are. Is it about a guy who just was like, oh, the world sucks and what the fuck am I going to do on somebody? It's somebody else's fault. No, every great movie, whatever. You guys got a problem and guess what he does solves the problem and that's what you're supposed to do. And this is an adventure. This, this life. But when you mean the individual like being an individual is the only way to be happy. What do you mean by that? That, well, first off that we should only be judged as individuals. That's it. So remove all the immutable characteristics. I'm gay, big dam. What? But you got any specific questions for me on that big dam? Whoop.

Speaker 2:          00:49:22       I was that big dam. Right? But like you know, like that, just saying that means nothing other than you can figure out who I sleep with. Right, right. Okay. That's it. All we can do is judge people as individuals and you have to just figure out what is right for you. So for all the people that I disagree with that are sort of like big government lefties and blah blah, and I get why that unique, maybe need a little more of that. If you live in a big city where you might need more noise regulations than if you lived in the freaking, if you live in the middle of Idaho on a farm or whatever, it's like if that's the life that you want to live, then fight for that. But what we're doing now is this collective is craziness, is causing people to be unable to think clearly.

Speaker 2:          00:50:01       So like Huffington post yesterday wrote a thing about how you have to choose between being for gay people are I said I think it was for queer people or for chick filet. Now I happened to be the peers because of Jack. Cause Jack got in trouble or he's tweet about chick filet and it was like you have a tweet about chick filet. He, yeah, cause he tweeted that he, he showed like a digital receipt that he bought chick filet and then solar. That O'brian was like, you tweeted that on gay pride month and it's like endless.

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       But why would he tweet of a chick filet receipt? Who the hell knows? The guy likes chicken fillet. Who Cares? We're not allowed to like it. Yeah, you better not like chick fil a chick fil A. I took a picture yesterday, there was a chick filet next door to, uh, to the theater we were at. I took a picture of chick ballet there and I tweeted out the thing and it's like, I like chicken sandwiches. Every time I've gone into a chick fil a that people are going to find me one fast food restaurant. Is that so that, so that's what he did. Oh, it's the cash app. That's one of our sponsors. You're 10% boosted. Chick-Filet was applied. You were charged 28 43 chick-filet ah, he dared and leave 10% on gay pride. He wrote boost and then he tagged chick-filet. Hmm. And Soledad O'brien showed who's I showed him who his loss.

Speaker 1:          00:51:19       But that's what I'm saying, that that sort of this endless guilting and, and you know you do this, so your eval it, it's ruining the fabric of society. It really is. Eat Chicken. If you like chicken, don't eat it if you don't like it. But that's what individualism is about. If you want to make the choice, if you think that whatever chick-filet is doing to gay people, whatever they're secretly doing, it gave live. You think that's so evil. Even though, by the way, during the pulse nightclub shooting at the gay club in Florida, when 51 people were killed, they gave free food to everybody. But if you think they hate gay people that much, then don't shop there. But you don't have to harangue everybody else into doing everything that you want them to do. That's actually the reverse of freedom, you know, live and let live that.

Speaker 1:          00:52:01       That's why I believe I could see people, if they're saying that chick filet is a homophobic institution that that you shouldn't endorse. Chick-Filet is particularly if you're a gay man, but what does that mean? I go into chip Jay, not that I know of. Okay, so it's not that that seemed weird. I don't like to, I don't know either. But he clearly is an influencer and I think that the cash app, if I had to gas, because they sponsored this podcast, they're very active in sponsoring podcasts. They probably have some sort of an endorsement deal with him, which is why he did that. So it was a financial thing for the cash app, if I want to guess. All right, so we don't know about that specifically, but if they were paying him to do it, I mean that's for him. That's again, that's for him as an individual to decide, I am going to say pride month is this month, this month, this is the gay as month there is dam and I'm here with you.

Speaker 1:          00:52:54       Hello. This is the gay as they come into all of June. All right. Yeah, June. It's very gay. But that's what I'm saying like how many people were upset, how many pieces but, but it goes exactly to where we started with this whole thing. There is this loud group of people and most of them have some sort of odd influencing media. They're all of these blue check, buzzfeed, 4,000 twitter follower people then retweet all of the articles of the people like them at Salon in box and buzzfeed and then in that, and they make it seem like we're all hysterical, crazy people. And I simply don't believe that, believe that most

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       people, I would say the vast majority of people probably, I mean I think it's something crazy like 80% of people I think are good, decent people who just want people to live. They want, you can fuck who you want to fuck. You can smoke what you want to smoke. You can't do it on my property. You can't take what's mine. You can't force me to bake a cake or do any of those things. But you can allow people to live as they see fit. I think that's what most people are and that's why there's such a push back. That's the answer to the Peterson. Peterson said, I'm not going to use pronouns that the government forces me to use. That's all. That's what put him on the, that it's all sold. I mean there's so many of them. They got so silly with that, that it, it, it made sense that someone was pushing back to 78 different gender pronouns.

Speaker 3:          00:54:08       And you're obviously dealing with people that are being silly. This is not like there's, it's not just people being silly. You remember when ms came along, there was miss and there was messages and when was that? What year was that? I was a kid. I remember being super confused. I'm like, dammit, a new thing. You know, what's the matter? He's the CEO of that company too. Who Is Jack? Yeah. Of Cash App. Oh, he's the advertising has company. Oh, well that makes total sense. Makes total sense. Yeah. Okay. Oh, there you go. Um, I just think that, well that's a tricky one. That's, that's different. Well look, he's a guy promoting something on one of the things that he owns and he, but he's doing it on gay pride month. Who Cares? I mean, really like it just so, so what is it that they, so I guess at one point they were against gay marriage and maybe they still are now.

Speaker 3:          00:55:01       Who knows what every cut. Think of all of us not to late CEO. Isn't the CEO dead? I think the CEO that was like super, I think it is the, the original guy in his honor. His wishes though and keep it close on Sunday still. You know what? Every time I do, but it's fuck, cause I want a chicken sandwich on Sunday. Yeah. So somebody should be opening that. Somebody should be opening the Sunday chicken sandwich. Not In pro gay, not in June. Solidarity to my gay brothers and sisters. It's all so stupid. Eat a sandwich if you want a sandwich. Don't, every time I've gotten into chick ballet when you've got it play, are they nicer? Not just when been there. Literally twice. And are they nice? I don't remember. They're nobody. They're friendly. They're friendly. They don't look yelled at me for things.

Speaker 3:          00:55:41       Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know ma'am. I just don't think that, uh, I don't think there's that much outrage. I think there's a business in outrage though, and there's certainly a business in a lot of people that write these articles. And the Jordan Peterson thing has been very illuminating to me because I've watched them misrepresent his positions on so many different things and call him so many horrible names, transphobic, racist, all right. All these different things and, and do so with, you know, with no justification or rationalization. Like you look at the actual article and they don't, they don't post to what he actually said. It's like that woman in the, uh, the munk debates. What was it called? Oh yeah. What was it called? The monk debate. Yeah. Yeah. Um, whoever that woman was

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       Goldberg, I think whatever. Amen. It was her and Eric a dyson. Yeah. When she said, you know, that he doesn't want her to, where he doesn't think she should be able to wear makeup at work. And he's like, I never said that. Well, you can google it. Well, we can. We can google it. We can find out. You made me Google something that you were wrong about. That's, that's upsetting to me. I don't want you to do that. You know, that bothers me more than anything. That is dishonest. It's a hundred percent dishonest. She knew. He did not say that if they were, he was having an intellectual exercise with an interviewer and it's, I think one of the things that's gotten him into trouble is his openness to discuss things with question mark. Just bad. I don't question marks. I don't know. I don't know if we can work together.

Speaker 1:          00:57:07       We've only been doing it for 40 years. I don't know. Why do women wear makeup in the workplace? Why do women wear short skirts and high heels? Why do they, I don't think he's saying you can't do that or you shouldn't be able to do that. He's saying why? He's saying that there's obvious realities and when you turn on CNN, why is it that Jake Tapper, Anderson Cooper, Wolf Blitzer and the rest of the men are all in suits. They dress exactly the same. Andersons are a little more tailored, but everybody just say, what are the women all wear every single woman dresses. They all wear dresses with cutoff sleeves. That right there all sprayed 10 they all have gorgeous hair, lipstick, blah, blah, blah. Why is it Wolf Blitzer walking in there with the, which we're going to have to cut off. I would look like Netflix special.

Speaker 1:          00:57:49       I have a whole bit about it. About women on Fox News versus men on Fox who's watching it with the sound off smoking pot. Some sort of a wild life show. It's something very strange. It's a weird cultural dance that we're doing, right? So the idea that Jordan's talking about this, that men and women dressed differently, women put on lipstick to look tracted why do you work out Joe Rogan? Uh, cause I don't tell people I don't want to buy now be angry. So number one, so you don't kill people. But number two, you want to look good. You want to feel good, you want to be in a body that you want to look good for your wife and blah, blah, blah. And you want to live long like the, to deny these realities all the time and to think that that's because of your toxic masculinity and all of this nonsense.

Speaker 1:          00:58:30       I agree that it is a loud minority, but what I, what I think maybe where we're having a little difference is that I think this thing has spread in a way. It is so easy to believe this nonsense, this abject drivel that it is. It is infecting young people at an alarming rate. But by the way, there's a lot of hopeful signs on this cause now they're doing all these studies that the generation right after millennials. So the kids that are like, you know like 15 now that they're actually more conservative now because they see all this as absolute hysteria. So I think there is, we are getting like a little bit of a rubber band effect on this thing and I think things are shifting into normalcy and that's why people are listening to your show and listening to Sam's podcast and everything else. I think there's an issue with people commenting on things that other people were saying and just sort of jumping in and not having the other person there to discuss these subjects

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       with it. Particularly like why do women wear makeup at work? Why do women dress the way they dress? I think if you sat, if you were sitting down with Jordan talking about it, he's willing to engage in these subjects with a very, very broad canvas. I mean, he's willing to look at all the various aspects of them because as a legitimate intellectual, that's what he's doing. It's an intellectual exercise in discussion of cultural norms. Like why do women wear the shoes where you can see their toes in the, in the workplace. Whereas if a guy showed up with flip flops on, you're like, Mike, the fuck we're at work here. Get outta here with this bullshit outfit. Yeah, go put on some goddamn dress shoes were in the office. You know, it is strange that women were very little close in comparison to the way men do on these shows.

Speaker 3:          01:00:09       And I don't think there's anything wrong with the discussion. The problem is framing it as if he's saying you shouldn't be able to, he's, if, if someone got on TV and said you shouldn't be able to wear makeup at work, you shouldn't be able to dress like that, that would be a problem. So think about what these guys are doing in effect. So, right, so you're saying that Jordan's taking basically a, a decent but potentially confusing position, but it's, but it's basically a right decision of let's have a conversation. So when they write all these hippies and why do they do it? Because they can't get any, you know, they just did release this study about journalists and they're basically all paid like 45 grand a year and they're alcoholics, you know, just broadly speaking. And they just want all these clicks. They want their jobs and they realize that these websites that are faking as journalists, uh, faking as places of journalism that they're just trying to hold onto their jobs as long as they can.

Speaker 3:          01:00:58       But if you're one of these people, what's a great way to keep your job? Oh, there's a guy out here who sold over a million copies of his book who's on tour selling out beacon theater and blah, blah, blah all over the world. I'm going to write a hit piece on him because guess what? That's going to drive a hell of a lot more traffic than writing something, something honest. So that's part of the game. And you know, he, I've discussed this many times, including onstage with him. Why does he keep retweeting the articles? His belief is while I'm still here, I'm still here. I have exposed them and I'm still here and if anything, I'm bigger because of it. And now one of them was a guy who was his friend. Yeah, I know he's pissed about that one. That was a weird one because the guy's argument was shit.

Speaker 3:          01:01:37       It was like I was, he was like, why? I think Jordan Peterson is dangerous. Like dangerous. You didn't explain dude, why. The problem with that is I don't give you many chances like that if you write something like that, it doesn't make any sense. Now I'm going to discredit your opinions. I'm not going to think about, I'm not going to go, Ooh, let me listen to this intelligent person's perspective. I'm going to go, oh, this is that silly fuck that dumb idea about Jordan Peterson. And I feel like it was just, it was a some sort of a rationalization for him. Getting attention to virtue, signal over what Peterson is saying. If it didn't, he didn't have any real points. It didn't make any sense. I don't think I actually read that, that full one, but I know that I tried to go back over it and see if I'm, if it made any sense to me and nothing.

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       You got nothing that he just didn't represent. His opinions are accurately. That's the problem. When people don't represent the opinions accurately set up a straw man and then attack the straw man and then have this click baity title. I'm like, Oh, you just need a hug. You need attention or is that what it is? You're not getting the attention. They need a hug. I mean, that's what they need.

Speaker 2:          01:02:38       I'm telling you, man, th this tour, it has been a freaking love fest. Every night when I go up there and I'm warming up the crowd and I'm doing silly lobster jokes and you know, some of his other buzz words, and I'll talk about, make a couple of jokes about Kathy Newman or like some other silly things. So we trying to say is like, I do like a role on though is like five different lines of like a whole bunch of other stuff. But like when I, I'll go up there and I, I usually make some reference to the intellectual dark web. And if I say your name or I say Shapiro or Sam or whatever, people go crazy. And what's, what I'm realizing about it is all of these people think about all the people, however many hundreds of thousands of people are watching this or listening to this right now.

Speaker 2:          01:03:16       And then how many millions will you know in the next two weeks or whatever. Most of them are doing it alone, right? They're watching on their phone or they're listening on their IPAD, whatever it is, or you're maybe watching with your boyfriend or girlfriend. But most people, it's a pretty solitary experience in the, in the world of what we do now imagine. And it's like when you do stand up now, 3000 people piled into this place and you can look around and go, Whoa, there's some other people like me and they're not bad people. And actually what I've found is that these people look good, they dress right. Like I'm not to make it all about material stuff, but like they look like people who are trying to get their shit together. And I think I said it to you right before we sat down, but me at this moment, I truly feel like, like the best that I've ever been, I really do. And it's partly because of that because you cannot be around that constantly. I'm not saying everything he says is right and I'm still not with them on some of the religious stuff. And I have Sam, I'm doing my show when I leave here to go with Sam Harris and there they, you know, they are really at logger heads on some of the,

Speaker 5:          01:04:16       the training need. I'm a moderator, I swear to God. And Sam has said this too. I swear to God, if I was there with the two of them, I could worked it out when that whole truth thing that they bounded back and forth for an hour on the meaning of truth. I wish I was there and we talked about doing some live event together. We never got around it because Sam's doing a lot of live events as well. So they're doing it with their having Bret Weinstein, uh, moderate it. But I would have been thrilled if it was, look, I love bread and there's nothing about prep or would be nice like so either it could have been one of us or or whatever. It's completely fine. And I think they just wanted like a more sciency focused person and he's a great biologist powerhouses. Like if there's any, like they're doing Jujitsu on each other. This is any like openings and trying to choke each other. It's kind of, but that's how we find out if ideas are valid, you know, you'll, you'll let guys like them discuss them. They just, it was very unfortunate that at least their first part. First one. Yeah. The second one I think was much better, but the first one was just a cluster fest. I called Sam up afterwards. I was like, this is crazy. This is a non conversation you guys. He's like, yeah, I just

Speaker 3:          01:05:17       got stuck. Yeah, but think how cool that is that two of them are. The two of them are some of our leading public intellectuals in the country, in the world, probably [inaudible]. They're debating over the nature of truth and millions of people care. That's a little different than what's going on on CNN on any given day. Oh, for sure. Well, there's a real problem with mainstream news and first of all, there's a problem in that it's a ratings driven thing. It's like everything they're doing, they're trying to get ratings. Anytime there's a big story in the news, it's just like, what is it? What are people going to pay attention to? That's what we're going to put on. There's no consideration. Like, is this interesting to us? Is this what we want to discuss? It's, it's a news program, but it's not a news program because it's also in an entertainment program and then they have commercials every 15 minutes.

Speaker 3:          01:06:02       Did you say that Jim Acosta thing? What he did during the, during the Korea thing like that is crazy. That's crazy that a journalist would insert himself into that sort of a situation and interrupt and yell things out and people don't have a problem with that. We are, we are truly watching the implosion of the media and that's why I meant before, it's like if they would just lie a little bit, well just lie a little bit on the margins as they probably always have done. I don't think we'd be in this position because people wouldn't be able to so clearly see how messed up the whole thing is. But because they've become so hysterical writing articles that are completely the reverse of the truth, because they're actually acting like petulant children all the time and because they, half the time it's like they pretend they're nonpartisan, but if you just look at any of these journalists, twitter feeds, it's like pretty obvious what you all are.

Speaker 3:          01:06:52       All of you in the mainstream media, they've created an opening so that now if people want some sense of truth, you turn into Joe Rogan and you're turning to all of these other shows. I think it's very difficult to get employment if you're not on one side of the fence or the other side of the fence and you're a journalist. It's not, it's, it's not a simple world like the world of podcasting where you truly can be independent. Yeah, and I mean I think, I think in a lot of ways it's like Hollywood. I mean I've always described Hollywood is one of the main problems with it. As you get a bunch of people that come here seeking attention, right? That's the reason why they are here in the first place. They want fame, they want exorbitant amounts of attention. And then on top of that, you are entered into this system where you have to be chosen for each part.

Speaker 3:          01:07:35       It's not like you can, like you have a sprint and the the guy who's the fastest is the one who wins. Yeah, it does not like that. It's someone's who smelled. Dave, why don't you read these lines like, hmm, I might like you dave. How do you feel about Hillary Clinton? Because I'm pro Clinton. I mean, we want Clinton to win. Don't we want Clinton to win Dave? And you're like, oh my God. Yeah, you'll drop your standards are like, I'm, I'm a huge supporter of Clinton. I think she's amazing. And I've seen this because you're, you're, it's this weird environment where you want these people to like you. So you are terrified of saying anything even remotely controversial that doesn't stick to the script of this left wing discourse. So there's all these people that are just, just, just faking it. They're bullshitting you if they didn't mind, not even have real opinions, but they've adopted this predetermined pattern of opinions that they think that is going to help them get through the door with these producers and these studio executives.

Speaker 3:          01:08:28       And that's Hollywood. And then when someone breaks free and you know, the, occasionally someone becomes right wing, you know, whoever the fuck they are with, it's chuck woolery or Dennis Miller, or they'll like, look at that fucking crazy man probe from the pack. You know, look at what's, what's his name, the fucking actor guy. The older guy, Jon Voight, not Jon voight, the other one. A very good actor. Gary sinise got a bigger deck, supposedly got in trouble with Dave crosses a wife. He said like Dave Cross's wife said that he tried to hit on her when she was 16. James Woods. James Woods. Yeah. Yeah. He's, he's really dealt himself. He's got a giant deck.

Speaker 2:          01:09:06       Yeah, that's what I hear. Uh, yeah, he's dealt himself in. He's all in. He's all in and he's like sort of like resigned himself to never work again. Yeah. I mean it means, but he's probably like 75 years old or whatever he is. He's probably, I don't give a fuck anymore. Yeah. I mean I'm pretty sure he's got fuck you money like probably, yeah, it's definitely saying fuck you. So if he doesn't have the money that he might want to send their data. Yeah, exactly. But doesn't that prove though why doing this was the right thing to do? Because I'm very aware right now. It's like I got a lot of good shit going on. I'm getting offers and all sorts of different things and I'm like, I, I, I'm my own boss. I'm not going to fire me. I'm not going to accidentally tweet something one day and then go with that.

Speaker 2:          01:09:45       I'm going to fire day Ruben. Like, you know, like my, my fans fund most of what we do and it's like I need to grow. Like we definitely need to grow because there's, we're just, my guys are just doing too much. But I'm also very aware that the more we start growing that, all the problems that you just laid out, we'll start becoming more and more real. So I like being as slim and trim as possible, at least for now because I don't want to be down the road where we've had, we got too many people. There's too many just different competing interests and business interests and political interests and everything else. So it's like, that's why, I mean you're what you're doing here, it's freaking, it's amazing man. It's amazing.

Speaker 3:          01:10:21       Yeah, it's nice to be able to do it for sure. It's nice to be able to just have opinions on things and, and, and also just know that you're a nice person and that you're not trying to, like, I'm not trying to do any evil. Like I'm in a, I'm, I like, I look at like who I am. Like I'm a nice guy. Like, okay, all right, well what are my opinions of, why can't I talk to this guy? Why can I have, what can I have discussions in these subjects? You know, like there's a lot of people that feel like if you're not in a certain group, you shouldn't have discussions on certain things. If you're a straight man, you shouldn't talk about gay rights. If you're a man, you shouldn't talk about women's issues. You shouldn't talk about me too. Unless you're 100% supportive. You shouldn't discuss the subtle nuance of human interaction. Well, it didn't. Martin Luther King, he wanted us to be judged by those things. Right. And he said, if you're only this color, you can talk about that. I'm pretty sure that's what he said. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       that's where we're at. But also, you know, there was an article right after that idw thing came out in the times that was calling you a conservative. And I think, I, I think I emailed it to you, man. It was the twitter thing. The renegade conservative, that's what it was. Pro Gay rights. Pro Women's rights. Pro choice pro marijuana, pro universal health care pro universal basic income. Like what else do I have to do? Like what other things am I, oh, pro second amendment. He must be right one. Yeah. Well, Joe, you're off. You can't just have you, what do you think? You can have a series of thoughts that don't all lock in with what you have to be in a pattern that you have to be in the pattern. I'm not just don't understand why someone's willing to be dishonest like that. Like a cursory examination of people's thoughts and positions on things would lead someone to realize I'm definitely not a right wing person, but, but the thing is that they own the narrative for so long and that they can still get away with it.

Speaker 1:          01:12:10       Yes, yes. And what's happening is now it's shifting and that's what I mean by I think we're starting to win. And I don't mean it when like we're going to destroy these people. I mean, I think the narrative has started to shift a little bit where the enthusiasm behind the conversations that we're all having, whoever it is in this thing, the enthusiasm is so great and there is no counter enthusiasts. Like where are all the versions of us on the other side of this? I'm a bright, no, I don't even mean on the right, like the people that really are selling identity politics had a really great way at a comedy level who have a huge podcast and like where is the, where is that intellectual set of people? Where's the Sam Harris of the other side of this or the that have real followings. They don't exist and that's partly why the hysteria has been ramped up.

Speaker 1:          01:12:55       They can't believe that out of nowhere, just because of our, all of our just wherewithal and desire to do what we think is right or what makes us happy or whatever the hell you want to call it. They can't believe we all freaking created something. Well, the queer shout that we're all in a group, I'm weirded out that we're in a super boy band. We're in a boy band or I guess Christina Hoff Summers. Isn't that band too? Who else is in that band? Is Heather in it? Yeah, it has it in hang a sheet in there. I mean it looks, we don't have to Brett, but you didn't get the car yet and then get the card. The clubhouse is under your studio. Man. Shapiro with joking around about it, but like we're like the super friends, like what is this? This is the weirdest avengers ever.

Speaker 1:          01:13:33       It's a weird group of humans. I mean me and Ben, we disagree on a lot of shit, but we're super friendly to each other. Like when I do his show or he does my, I really enjoy that guy like him. You do freaking Shapiro show before my show what? Sorry. What? The guys had a shelf for three weeks. People were mad at me with the way I dressed. See that. They're like, everybody else is wearing a nice shirt at a time. Like, listen man, I told the guy I was on my way to the comedy store. You want to take a photo of me? I'll be there. You're not in the bush. In the brush. Yeah. I should be in a bush. I everybody down sucking it up my ass. I'm wearing a fucking chucks or converse and a some sort of a flannel shirt that I bought that jacket Alaska.

Speaker 1:          01:14:14       I've just, that's how it was where I just, what I was wearing at the comedy store. I said, all right man, that's what I'm wearing. No greenery around. The comedy store could go up to sunset, but either way I just don't, I don't give a fuck. That's what I looked like. That's who I am. I'm not interested in portraying an image. Just it is what it is. You know? It's like this, this intellectual dark web like it's fucking Eric. He's crazy and he's, he gets mad when I call him crazy. He loves it. He's trying to get me to, are you on the whatsapp? Oh, I'm on the one hand. The little fucking check group. No, I haven't jumped in yet. I've been busy. I don't have the time. Just two or three messages a day for different group text conversations with comedians were talking shit about things and talking around.

Speaker 1:          01:15:02       I don't have time for this. I'm busy, man. All right, well then you can't come to the club trying to make a yoga class. I don't know. Fucking time. Yeah. Who the hell goes like are we a group that we do, we have a meeting and shall act cards and like we have in common. I think we have a respect for our audience and intellectual curiosity. Curiosity for sure. Yeah. Yeah. And I think that's where, that's where a guy like me and Shapiro, although we have very different opinions on many different things, you know, I think we both are intellectually curious. Yeah. So think about it. I've had been on many times, I consider him a friend. We've, we've broke bread together, although he's kosher, which makes it fucking pain. What do you have to eat? Has such a smart guy. Follow that blue, do well.

Speaker 1:          01:15:46       I eat whatever the hell it to him about whatever I want. But he usually brings something or you know, has to watch. You did a kosher restaurant. I did eat at a kosher restaurant with him once, but then it was all these orthodox Jews there and then they treat him like Jesus. And I was like, dude, I'm not a photographer. You know what I mean? I have to take all these pictures of him. And they're like, who's that guy? I was like, I'm not doing that again, but it's funny, but you know, I've had Shapiro and look, he's not inherently for gay marriage, right? I've had my studio is in my house where I knew what his thoughts on gay marriage. Well, now he takes the Libertarian position at, which is the government shouldn't be involved, but I don't know. But I see a lot of conservatives doing that where they should have all, like, this is where Rand Paul Lynn mentioned before, he should have been years ago screaming that he's for gay marriage because if you're truly a libertarian, the government doesn't delaminate the smoke was sleep with the libertarians.

Speaker 1:          01:16:31       She could have taken a really awesome, powerful, principled position and said, this isn't about religion. It's not about, it's about freedom. It's one of the things that a shove in the face of people that were Hillary Clinton supporters and my, do you know that she didn't support gay marriage? She'll 2013 you know, goddamn crazy. It is. I supported it when I was 13 this fucking grown up old lady with grandchildren. Yeah. Is Talent people that she's not for gay marriage until it became convenient politically and she just wanted to separate herself as being at least the semi conservative option compared to Barack Obama. Look, Barack Obama was not for gay marriage at the beginning. He got pinned into it. Biden made that stupid

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       comment on meet the press where he was basically like, everyone's forward and then Obama had to come out for it. But think about it. If, if all of this stuff that we're talking about keeps winning, if it all keeps winning, what will happen in 50 years, they will literally look back at video of Barack Obama campaigning the first time around saying that he's for traditional marriage and they will call Barack Obama a homophobe and they will eventually want them. They will want the Barack Obama library that's being built now in Chicago. They will want that being taken down because that will be the, that will be the statues of our day. So that that's why I don't know where you're at on the monument stuff, but I would not take any of them down. You can put up a counselor plaque or something right next to it to say Robert E. Lee did this or that, but the idea that they're removing the shit I think is absolutely terrible. You can't erase history.

Speaker 5:          01:17:53       No, I agree with you. I think they should. This is a problem with having them in town squares and celebrating them, but there's also a problem that they were all, most of them, the ones that you're there, they're talking about in the south. They were resurrected during the civil rights movement to sort of counteract the civil rights movement. So like these, these are really, this is not like a celebration of these people back in the day when they were a viable, this is during the civil rights movement. They erected these fairly cheap and they put them up quickly and they did it in response to black people wanting more rights and you know, they would still, I would still face, yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:18:29       I get it. I would still be not for taking them down. You put up something next to it, you put it, you see what I would you want to come?

Speaker 5:          01:18:36       I'm for taking it down and replacing them with something else and putting them somewhere else. Like if you want to have a civil war museum. So that would be the compromise where you could get me, I'm not saying you should melt them, but it's, there's something too, there's something to the argument that they're racist statues and especially if you understand the motivation behind creating them in the first place. Yeah. The problem though is that,

Speaker 2:          01:18:58       you know, I mean, I know you know this, it never ends where it's supposed to end,

Speaker 5:          01:19:01       wanted to go after George Washington and trump said they did. Trump said that and people were riddick ridiculing him. And then almost immediately afterwards, someone wanted to take down a statue of George Wallace.

Speaker 2:          01:19:11       I was in old town Alexandria where George Washington's Church was, and it's actually the same church that Robert E. Lee went to. So they had a plaque for both of them. And because they took down the Robert E. Lee One, they also took down the George Washington one at the church that George Washington went to. I mean, if you follow that logic, and this is what you have to do when you're, when you're doing these sort of historical trackings, they will come for everything. So think about it. Thomas Jefferson's my favorite founder, Thomas Jefferson. You can go to his house in Monte Cello and they do, if you go on the tour, it's incredible. They are incredibly honest about his relationship to slavery, that he owned slaves his whole life. He was having an affair with at least one slave and most likely had children with that slave. At the same time he was writing the laws that freed the slaves. So without this man, these things don't move forward. So we all live with these odd in consistencies. George Washington, George Washington, who gave up power after the, after the revolution, like he did the most incredible thing. You know, he a power as the commander

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       of the army after the revolution, the most incredible thing that a leader of a country could do. He owned slaves his entire life when he died and this, they do this at his house in, um, it's out. It's outside DC. I'm blanking on it for a second. I'll get in a second. But you can go on the tour there. And he had his slaves his entire life. When he died, his half of the slaves got freed. But Martha Washington's half didn't, Martha kept a slot that kept this bitch. Yeah. So it's like all of these things, it's like so surely had half the slaves were kind of inherited them I think from her parents or something like that. Like it's all, it's deeply twisted and warped. And of course it was. Now of course we can objectively look at it and go, slavery was wrong and you shouldn't of course.

Speaker 1:          01:20:53       But they all were doing things in their time that you'd, the world doesn't magically become what you want it to be just because you exist and think something. And the more that we start thinking that, the more we'll eventually come after Obama for running against gay marriage the first time and, and all of these things. There is something that we think you love meat, right? You love elk and all this other stuff. Guess what? One day, if this craziness keeps going, they will look back when you're grandfather and there'll be like date meet because we're at that point we'll be eating, you know, artificially produced whatever. And they'll, they'll literally watch videos of you chomping on, you know, some ribs and go see what a savage he was. So that's why you have to just be aware of what your time is. Your time in this world.

Speaker 1:          01:21:33       Yeah. They're doing it right now. Exactly. Yeah. Um, did you ever see the video of Obama talking about illegal immigration? It's incredible. It's really amazing. It's when he was a senator and running for president the first time. And he is more like, he's stricter than, than trump. Yes. I mean it's a fascinating thing because no one brings that up and no one called him braced. But I guess we're dealing with a long time ago, you know, I mean, there's a couple of things. He was, it was a 2011 it was doing that. He was a senator, so it was probably around 2010, 2011, something like that. I mean, look, there's a lot of things there, right? He, I mean, he's black number one. So it's like they're not going to call him racist. It doesn't, it creates a thing where they can't compute. What does that actually mean?

Speaker 1:          01:22:17       He was saying the things that people wanted to hear. He also wanted it to be elected. He wanted to be elected. So they elevated him to a point that he was God play that he was pulseless listened to this 2005, 2005. Yeah, it says early. Oh, so he's on the need to better secure the border and a punish employers who chose to hire illegal immigrants. Uh, you know, we are a generous and welcoming people here in the United States, but those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law. Uh, and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law. We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting

Speaker 6:          01:23:06       patiently, diligently, and lawfully, uh, to become immigrants in this country. So that's why we need to start by giving agencies charged with border security, new technology, new facilities, and more people to stop the process and deport illegal immigrants. Having said that, securing the borders alone does not solve immigration management. We're going to have to better manage legal immigration in order to end illegal immigration. Uh, senators, mccain and Kennedy point us in the right direction on that point right now we've got millions of illegal immigrants who live and work here without knowing their identity or background. That's part of the reason that we need a guest worker program to replace the flood of illegals with a regulated stream of legals who enter the United States after checks and with access to labor rights. Part of the reason that illegal immigration is so damaging is that it ends up creating a pool of workers with depressed wages and no rights. And that's not something that we find acceptable. It's crazy dude. American employers also need to take responsibility. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:24:18       I mean I just scribbled down like I was doing homework in seventh grade and think about what he said there. We have to secure the border, secure the border trunk, secure the border, punish you if you hire, if you hire illegal workers, if you, if you enter illegally, you're showing disregard for our laws. You, we cannot allow illegals to pour in. Uh, we can't let them go ahead of lawful people who are trying to enter the country. We need better border security, more pr, more process and deportations. Uh, we have to better manage legal immigration. And then he talked about the millions that are here now, which in effect is a pathway to citizenship, which by the way, trump is basically four at some level. So it's like, so what are we really talking about? Every time we scream that everybody is racist? It did. He just make a wild what, sorry. I assume he's talking about Latino people. So as Barack Obama racist against Latino people.

Speaker 3:          01:25:08       Well this was when he was a senator Ellis. Like he was elected in 2008 and so he was probably gearing up to run when he was in 2005 the things that he was saying, he was letting people know who he is and that he's out there and starting the ball rolling. You know this a different time to 2005 was just a different world and it seems like it shouldn't be because it was only 13 years ago, but God damn is it different? So what does that say then? What, what does that actually say about the way things have changed or the cult of personality around trump or just sort of the general derangement of the media that they can't view these things. It's not just a media. I think it's also people's access to communication. The fact that anyone can voice their opinion, whether it's on facebook or youtube or what have you, you know, it's, it's a different world. Twitter, you can just, you can just tweet instantaneously. This is fucking bullshit. You know, people should be able to whatever they want or whatever,

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       you know, whatever you want to say. And then a bunch of people can agree or disagree or retweeted or do you know or or or screen grab it because they think that it's damaging to you and they put a, can't believe you support this piece of shit and think about it. You can wake up on any given morning, find someone you've never heard of who said something you slightly disagree with and you can help get them fired. That's a lot of, there's a lot of people want to do that too, which is really interesting that people want to get people fired for opinions. Does that doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but really if we were to do a deep dive on that, it's like, well what did we just hear that is different than what trump is trying to do right now? Does trump you sloppy language?

Speaker 1:          01:26:38       Yes. Does trump lie? Yes, but they all lie. Obama, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor lie Siri or red line the lie. Those are pretty big lies that he did not as trump lie about everything constantly. Yes, but what he has a way of doing is getting these odd big picture things correct. And then it causes this. So like almost anything. So like they'll say you okay. You know, just in the last couple of days with North Korea that trump said, um, I've been traveling a lot. So like getting the exact quote, it'll be tough, but it'll be something like, um, you know, trump said to the North Korean dictator that they are, that they're good friends now or something like that. Like he's already giving him respect. Well, it's like if Obama, Obama, when Obama ran, he said he would sit down with aqua, Diana died and he would sit down with the leaders in North Korea and the rest of those things.

Speaker 1:          01:27:26       Now trump is doing it. So it's like, do you want him to sit down with them and tell him to go fuck himself at the same time? Like I'm not even saying this things good or bad. I have no freaking clue. Nobody has a clue. But everyone has every opinion on everything. Well, people want them to fail too, which is fascinating to me because you see the Bill Maher side? No. So Bill Maher on Bill Maher on Friday. He said that he's hoping for a recession because that's how we'll get rid of trump. Now. We talked a little bit about bill before this thing, but like, oh my God, he's been a huge influence of mine. I like him. I used to want to be on the show. I've kind of moved past that at this point, but think about it, you know, Bill is probably worth a hundred million bucks or something.

Speaker 1:          01:28:03       I have no idea, but like he can afford living through a recession, but when people talk about the liberal elite that they hate, it's that type of person. It's this person on the coast who's like, yeah, yeah, have a recession so we can get rid of trump. I hope he does amazingly well. I agree. I hope trump does amazing the well in terms of country when I hope he evolves his ideas as a human being. I hope he does. Mushrooms grows to love people. Why would you hope for failure? Especially failure for the whole country and sending people into a recession, which is undoubtedly going to cause suicides and turmoil and crisis, and people are going to go into panic thinking and panic voting, which is not what you want. I mean, literally that's what started Hitler. I mean that, that, that's what started Nazi Germany, right? They were in the middle of a horrible recession and this guy came along that proposed a solution. You're not going to get a better version of the future by people living in fear and poverty and sadness. Like

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       I as I didn't vote for trump, but he's the president I want him to do great. I don't agree with him on a lot of shit. He lies about a lot of shit. Yeah. Still want them to do great. You know why? Because he is the guy that's running the country visa running the country. I want the country to do well no matter who's running it like that. My, my thought was like this, this is almost what it's like. It's like, I don't like this doctor, so when he fixes my knee, I hope you box it up. Right. That's it. That's it. It's really almost what it's like. It's like he's the God damn president. Okay. If you want him to be in peach, because he's done some fucking horrible crime, which I still, I've gone over all this Russian stuff. I still am not convinced that he did anything horrible.

Speaker 3:          01:29:45       I don't see, it seems like the Democrats did more horrible things. Definitely aiming caught on something. They definitely did something. And just what they did to Bernie Sanders alone should be a devastating blow to the credibility of the DNC. It really should. Yeah. And the fact that it's not, it's just, it's just blind allegiance and that he could say, I hope for a recession. Maybe he said that without thinking, you know, maybe it was just a flipping remark or, you know, I'm pretty sure it was a, it was a package line. Never hope for a recession, no matter what. I would hope the guy does fantastic. Even if he's hated across the board. I hope he does an amazing job. And I hope the economy sores and I hope people have more jobs, more. I hope there's a method to his madness. I really do. Why would anybody hope differently?

Speaker 3:          01:30:26       I don't understand. Well, I agree with that and basically, and again, I voted for Gary Johnson. Look, if I had my choice, I'm pretty sure you know me well enough. Like I would much rather have like a really bright intellectual person who I'd rather have randon I, yeah, I'd much rather have rand Paul. I'd rather have a libertarian who basically is kicking everything back to the states. But you know what? Trump is cutting a ton of regulation and doing a lot of states rights stuff. The economy's doing really well. Do you have any sense that we're going to get into something tractable war in the Middle East to nation build? I don't think under his watch there may be some level of some peace now in the North Korean Peninsula. So it's like thing, man, I don't think anybody else would have done what he did with North Korea. So talked to a bunch of shit to that guy.

Speaker 3:          01:31:06       I'm going to call him fat short. And you know, like it was very funny. Like what he does is kind of funny and then he gets to have a meeting with the guy and the guy agrees to a meeting with it. I think they're baffled by him. They don't know what to do with him. North Korea and South Korea, when the presidents of the two countries met at the DMZ and shook hands like that was an historic moment. Like maybe they can get past all this fucking bullshit that's been going on forever. And if part of that was helped in some way by trump being crazy, like maybe it's good to have someone that fucks things up a little bit and mixes it up. It doesn't mean he's a perfect person. It doesn't mean he's not a liar, right wing conservative neocon Joe Rogan, but Nigga about it. So they'd be like, what does he do? So he brings in John Bolton, who's thought of as a neo-con, like a warmonger Neil Kahn, and then he has madison as the secretary of defense. Warmonger neo-con maybe what he was doing is that he was scaring people from the get go. And I'm going to bring

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       in all these people who are really scary, who don't talk about peace that often, who don't, who talk about exercising our power and all of that stuff so that Kim Jong Un is going to go, hmm maybe this time they are actually being, they might actually depose me cause I don't. Yeah, he's looking at the trump is like this guy's fucking crazy. And by the way, this is where I would say my, my side in this, the libertarian side is pretty weak on this cause a guy like ran Paul. What he would say is, you know, we should be cutting all military and never doing anything about law, in which case you can make a strong argument that you're constantly emboldening your enemies all the time because if they know you never want to do anything, then it's not a great argument to get bad actors to stop doing things.

Speaker 2:          01:32:38       But I think that's a great place to have a, a good conversation. And Rand Paul is supported a lot of this stuff trump has done at the same time. Yeah. Um, I'm gonna just, I just don't understand the logic behind wanting a recession when I can understand the logic around wanting someone else to take over in two years or three years when the new elections take place. But, but don't you think things are basically going pretty well right now? Like if you remove the twitter hysteria, like remove just like hysteria, stuff like this. He said, she said like in terms of what's happening in the country right now, black and Latino unemployment all time low economies chugging along, um, like the basic things that matter for a society are working. That's pretty good, right? It's now really good. I don't know enough about this, but what I've understood what I've, what's been explained to me is that a lot of this is the momentum of what Obama did when he was in office and that the economy, he's riding the work of Obama, there's riding the wave of the previous administration's policies.

Speaker 2:          01:33:37       So I've, I've, yeah, I've had a economists on my show argued kind of both sides of this thing. Most don't agree with that, but I've had probably more libertarian leaning economist in general. Well because they're all about cutting regulation all the time and trump has been very good at that. I think it's something like, at one point it was like for every 63 um, or for every one regulation he passed, he cuts something like 63 regulations. So if you're a libertarian economic economist or someone on the right economically you want the government out of all of that stuff. So they're very happy at the, at the economic level right now. But all right. But let's even say that's completely true what you just said there, that this is all just because of Obama stuff. Well, it's working. Like we've got a guy that maybe has just picked up the ball and he's the lucky guy and maybe he's going to get it to the next thing.

Speaker 2:          01:34:23       But what I'm actually more enthused by is that I think after all this craziness that we're in right now, I actually think people are so starved for sanity and like a reset to decency. I actually think things are going to get much better. I think again, this is where I think the conversations that we're all having or are affecting things in a big way and I think that even politically it's going to start bubbling up. I when I was in DC the other day, I was at a small dinner with a pretty influential senator who probably doesn't want me to say his name is not going to say it but I'll tell it to you later. But on the river somebody, it was somebody big and he got it. He, he really got it like he knew about us like this whole thing and that's what I'm saying like I'm not sitting here like, oh my God, it's so amazing what we're doing.

Speaker 2:          01:35:05       But there something, there is something happening and I think it will reach the political level too, that people will not want the hysteria anymore and that eventually trump will, because of his own craziness, become unnecessary. You won't always need the icebreaker. We needed the icebreaker to get all this shit out. Now it's all out. Everyone's reevaluating everything and then out of that is going to grow. I mean, look, maybe it grows something horrible, right? Like maybe the Hitler comes. I don't think, I obviously hope it doesn't happen, but what I think is that something decent is going to come that that's just, that's just her.

Speaker 5:          01:35:40       Something decent is going to come on. I think there is, there's a lot of decent that's coming right now, but I think there's some people that are always going to resist that. Oh, of course. People that are just ideologically driven and they can't be shaken from the, they can't be shook from that position. They just, they're hard left or they're hard ride or whatever they are. They have this rigid idea in their head of what reality is and anything that's contrary to that, they're going to oppose. And I think Jordan has been one of my favorite lightning rods for observation for watching this because all the disingenuous articles about him deceptive, talking about his positions and an extremely inaccurate ways and labeling him as some sort of a prejudice, terrible person. What those have done is solidified this idea that there is a campaign of people that just are completely ideologically driven and they don't mind being deceptive.

Speaker 5:          01:36:34       And that strengthens the puzzle. It helps people like us that just talk about stuff and don't mind talking about being incorrect or ignorant or not worried. We're not worried about our stance. We just, we're, we're going about most conversations from a place of objectivity if it as much as we possibly can. Most people are subjective at least to a certain extent, as much objectivity as we can, as much honesty as we can. And just talking about things. And this is, um, this is something that's not happening in these little click baity articles or in people that interrupt your shows and shake fucking jars and Nicole's or whatever they're doing. It's like there's that, all that stuff's strengthens this position that we're in, that we're in this weird time of intellectual dishonesty and turmoil. And I think a lot of it is because there's a lot of people that were just extremely upset that trump got into office and anything that seems to represent that position or that side must be opposed violence.

Speaker 2:          01:37:34       Yeah. So I think underneath everything you're saying, the right there, you're very hopeful right now. I actually sense that you're really hopeful. And I am too. And it's like, how could we ever do this if we weren't right? Like I, I would say that I'm a, if I had to like sort of widdle it down what I am at, at the core, I basically, I'm a world weary optimist. I'm an optimist by nature. But I believe that the world, the world is rough and tumble and all the things that Jordan would say about existence, I believe. But I'm still an optimist. Despite that and what you just said, right there basically is showing that the trump thing was necessary because imagine if hillary was president right now in the same machine and bullshit and nonsense and media and all of that stuff kept churning along.

Speaker 2:          01:38:16       Think how much worse it would be for these conversations right now we would so beyond the wrongs, you know the wrong side of things so to speak, and the forces that don't want us to do anything good and have conversations would have been so emboldened. Trump just came and took a freaking bat to the whole thing. Now, as I discussed with Eric Weinstein, it's like trump was the bull in the China shop. I think most of us would have preferred a panther wait, like we kind of wanted something to walk through, knock a few things off. Trump just blew up the whole thing. You don't the phrases bull in a China shop, not a panther in a China shop. That's right. So that's what you get. But after this, for every reason you just said there is going to be a return to sanity. It. It goes one of two ways, but I, I just am a firm believer that it will go that way, that there is enough of us out there now trying to reset things and because I don't think people are evil.

Speaker 2:          01:39:03       I don't think people want to be talked down to. I don't think people are dumb and even the people who are dumb, I don't think they want to be dumb and because of all of that, I think this was the necessary thing to happen right now. I'm with you that I think, I hope that he continues to do basically good things and that if that means that he gets in for another four years and continues to do good things then so be it. But yes, would I prefer that it's sort of more of a small government calm person who could tell you how many branches of government there are and like all of that shit and all of the stuff from that flag that's right behind you. Yeah. I've got a freaking declaration of independence in our control room and a constitution and a big American flag. Like, would I rather someone who knew what the federalist papers are and all of those things be in the Oval Office? Yes. You don't get everything you want in life, so you just kind of work with what comes and I think we can, we have a little room to work right now. I think

Speaker 5:          01:39:56       also as more people open themselves up to the ideas that Jordan is espousing or you are, I am or more people are genuinely objective about these ideas and start discussing them. The more frantic the people on the radical left in the the, what would they call the regressive left, the more ridiculous they're going to get and the more obvious it's going to get that they're out of control. It's just what happens. People Start Ranting and screaming louder because the, their initial meshes doesn't work. It's not like they're going to go back and revamp the message and make it more logical. There's no logical message there, but think about that. So when that's exactly what they're doing with trump too. You keep screaming trump's Hitler, right? He keeps screaming, trump's Hitler, Hitler, Hitler.

Speaker 2:          01:40:39       Now, Hitler killed millions and millions of people in many more millions were killed because of Hitler that he didn't directly kill. Now, if you keep doing that with trump, and then someone plays that Barack Obama clip and you go, wait, whoa, whoa, Whoa, you're calling trump Hitler. Here's Obama saying something that actually sounds possibly even more extreme. If you believe this is an extreme position to take. So now is, is Obama Hiller. And what they're doing is they're creating a situation where they're going to cause a rebound so that people will be like, oh, these guys aren't all nuts. But if they, if they destroy all of our ability to have this conversation, then when the real Hitler comes in, we won't even be able to recognize it because they will have cried wolf to the point that someone's going to come in and they're gonna have a big smile. It won't be a trump win when Hitler, the Hitler type, and I hate using Hitler as the, as the metaphor, cause it's so overplayed.

Speaker 2:          01:41:27       But like when the Hitler type comes, it ain't come in as the angry guy like trump is. It's going to come with a smile on its face, right? That's that socialist tee shirt like you know, socialism, Smiley face. That's how it will come because it will be masked in identity politics. It will be masked in all of this nonsense that will rip us apart. That will literally have us killing each other on the streets. What do you think would cause a, what scenario do you foresee? There could be possibly if the extreme, the ideas of what I consider the fringe left, which are pretty much mainstream Democrat ideas already. If the Democrats keep going more towards the Bernie, Elizabeth Warren, Keith Ellison, real hard left progressive stuff. It is rooted in identity politics, which I, you know we've done already but like it is rooted in something that separates us.

Speaker 2:          01:42:16       It is rooted that you should that even today. Did you see this, that Harvard, I just tweeted out when I was on the way here, Harvard released this statement of defending the fact that they are okay with basically having quotas that work against Asian students because they want to have more other minorities basically meaning black or Hispanic minorities. So think about it. Why would you discriminate if you are hiring right now, let's say you're hiring today, right? You're hiring for your studio, you can hire, you can hire the most qualified person. Are you going to try to figure out every little identity thing to figure out who you should hire? Diversity, Bro, I'm all about diversity. Exactly. You'd hire, it's racist against Asians. Just haven't been very vocal about it cause they, they tend to just put their fucking nose to the grindstone and keep ticking out so they have to use that against them.

Speaker 2:          01:43:02       Now that works so that that's the new thing. You will not be a, if you're Asian and you, and why did they, why did Asian Americans are Indian Americans are a great example that they have succeeded at every level that we measure success. I think the highest socioeconomic average salary over a hundred grand and no education, et Cetera, et cetera. If you now say, well wait a minute, these people played by the rules, they came here as it most, you know, like, like all of our ancestors virtually came here pretty much with nothing. People on small businesses busted their ass, worked in coal mines, it's said wherever you had to do it, if you do all of those things and then you focus on education and on family and all of those things. And now the system is going to say, well it worked for a while, but we're going to have to put you at the bottom of the thing now.

Speaker 2:          01:43:43       And you guess what? You're not going to get into Harvard because you're Asian. That is racism. So I've been calling this out for at least two years that the next move by this identity politics, this evil oppression Olympics machine is that they will come after Asian people and it's starting to happen now. So I see all these minorities, by the way. So candace, who, I watched the show and I know you guys definitely have disagreements on stuff as do I do when it comes not only to politics but tactics sometimes and stuff, but I really do like her. Um, you know, look, she's causing a massive rift in the black community and you can see it in the numbers. Black male support for trump or for trump? Doubled it was at 11% it's 22 no one. Well, it's Kanye. Kanye was the wrecking machine, but I actually think, I think in the grand scheme of things can't, candace is much bigger.

Speaker 2:          01:44:27       I really believe that in terms of, because I think she could be a direct line to all of the political parts of this if she decides to go that route because I think she could, I think she could run for Senate or, yeah. Yeah. I, I can't, I'm not high today. Not, I'm only smoking maybe once a week on Sundays and now and now I'm on tour so I'm not really at all, but let us park up at joint and have you reconsidered what you just said? You can smoke a joint and maybe I'll reconsider. Said you watched the podcast I did with her. Yeah. Yeah. I watch, I don't know. Maybe at least at least an hour and a half of it or so. Yeah. Why? Why? What? I don't know why you saying it that way because I don't think she should run for Senate. No, no. I'm not saying she's a, a young girl with some interesting ideas and she's got a lot of passion.

Speaker 2:          01:45:12       I know. I didn't say, I didn't say you think she should. I even say I think she's here. I think she could have a bigger effect. Even then Kanye, when it comes to just everything going on politically, I'm going to ask you again, this girl, she wants it. She wants it, man. Sure she does, but when you share affecting people in a big way, I think maybe in a bigger way than then perhaps either one of us don't understand, but my butt forgetting candace specifically. My point. My point was nice person. Yeah. My point was though that I think all minority groups are reevaluating what's going on here. If you're in the black community, clearly there is at the moment a reevaluation of do we have to be democratic? If you're, that is an issue. Yeah. It's a, it's a racist issue. Yes. Because people assume that if you're black, you must be a democrat.

Speaker 2:          01:45:57       If you're not, you're some sort of an uncle Tom. It's kind of fucked up. Yeah. Talk to my friends, Larry Elder, I had thomas soul on the show or my buddy David Webb, or, or many of, there are many black conservatives. Sure you are allowed to think however you want it despite your skin color. Right? So I think the black community, Ben Carson, I mean I think the black community starting to split, I think the gay community starting to split because the left has sort of had this odd embracement of Islam, which is bad for gays. So I think the gays are starting to split. I think that, uh, Latinos are even starting to split a little bit differently because I think for all the people that came here legally, they're actually not as thrilled with illegal immigration as the media may imply that they are. So I think there's just massive shifts happening all over the place. And the way we look at voting where every election, you know, what's his name? John King goes on CNN and shows you the map and he goes, well, the white working class people here voted this way and the black inner

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       city people. But I think all of that is about to explode and they won't know what to do because they haven't been listening. But I think some others have them. Listen, there's real room in this country for a third party. I mean, I think for sure someone could take a position that's outside those two boxes. Yeah. And and make some real valid points and have a little bit of ideas from each side. But the real concern, this country seems to be throwing your vote away, right? That's the thing that people were always worried about. Well, if you go that way, you're throwing your vote away and you're essentially giving it to the person that is on the other side. I used to kind of buy into that, right? Cause realistically within, but this is why I was so disappointed in Gary Johnson. Every half the country hated hillary, half the country hated trump at at the highest levels that you could hate a candidate.

Speaker 3:          01:47:35       Right. So if there was ever a time for just a decent guy, right? Like Gary Johnson's, just a decent guy. If he was here, like he'd probably want to spark up and you know, and a nice guy, he's just a nice guy. But he was such an ineffective, confused memory problem. Couldn't lay out his basic principles simply, you know, he wanted as a libertarian, he wanted the baker to bake the cake. That that's a crazy position to hold as a libertarian. Makes no, it's completely against. What would be your, uh, line of thinking as a libertarian, you would never want the government to force someone to do a specific task. Talking about the gay couple that wanted a wedding cake made. Yeah. Yeah. What's your position on that, by the way? Um, well there's two issues. One issue is that this, they apparently went to places they thought would deny them so that they can make a story out of it.

Speaker 3:          01:48:25       Yeah. It wasn't as simple as a loving couple went to someplace they wanted to get a cake made and the people said no. And they're like, what the fuck? Now they wanted a story and this, so they sought out places that they thought were going to deny them and then they made a giant national event out of it. I don't think people should discriminate to the point where they're not going to make someone a cake. I mean, I think there's the government. Do you think the government should, government shouldn't step in? No. Yeah, I think you should let people know publicly these, these are people that they discriminate against gay people. And so if you want your dollars to represent your opinions and your feelings on things, maybe you shouldn't buy a cake from these folks that don't want to make a cake for gay people.

Speaker 3:          01:49:11       But the idea of the government's going to step in. It seems crazy to me. But then as soon as I say that, I go, okay, well what if they wouldn't make a cake for black people? Should the government step in then? So, okay, so there's a couple of things, right? So there's a couple of things there. So first off it, it was about the specifics of the cake. I know this guy had a lot of people are going to get into the nitty gritty of every legal part of this thing. But it was about a specific, it wasn't that he wasn't going to sell them a cake that was on the shelf. Right. Didn't want to make, he didn't want to make them a cake for this wedding. Now that's asking him to do something that's artistic or that's not, what was the variables like that. You want men.

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       So I apparently am the conversation actually never got to that point cause he denied them before that because he knew what it was going to be. So it never got to like, oh, are you when you're going to draw us together or whatever. But he knew it was going to be a gay wedding. So let just said no, I'm not making a cake for a gay wedding right now. Look. But they could have bought a cake that was there. So like it was an interracial wedding. Would you have a more of an issue with that? So, so here's the deal. So it's, look, we have the civil rights act of 1964. You have to serve people based on race and, uh, all of the minority statuses that there are. I'm not for re litigating that, but uh, but there are, there is a libertarian argument that basically would say we don't need those laws anymore because the, the civil rights act was in response to Jim Crow laws were states in the south had discriminatory laws.

Speaker 2:          01:50:34       So we had the federal government come in and clean that up for everybody. So you have to serve everyone equally. You can't deny a black couple to come into your restaurant or [inaudible] can you walk? Can you deny a gay person then? Nope, because, but it was a specific thing. It was a specific, so let look put it, put it this way. If you had a, if there was a Jewish artist who took commissions, uh, for paintings, would you force that person to bake to paint Neo Nazi signs? Of course not. You would never have the government come in and say that they are forced to paint something that's against their conscience. So I would say that your original position is the right one, which is, it kind of sucks, right? It kind of sounds like, I wish in my heart of hearts I'm gay again.

Speaker 2:          01:51:16       Like I wish that every Baker would treat everyone equally and every person would treat everyone equally. They're not allowed. He wasn't allowed to deny them something that was in the store already because you can't deny based on those protected categories. So he wouldn't have by the Civil Rights Act, he wouldn't have been allowed to deny a interracial couple of cake that existed there already. But could he have cody have denied them one that he would have had to draw a black woman and a white woman if he was a real racist. I think the answer is that he could have denied them that and that would have been very shitty and he would be a racist and a really awful person. But if the answer is that the government should then come in and tell this man what to do, I would not be for that. I see what you're saying.

Speaker 2:          01:52:00       Um, I just, that's just the cleanest way to deal with this related to freedom. It's kind of shitty. Like freedom is messy. It's definitely shitty. It's Shitty. And, but the government can't protect you from shitty. Yeah, no, I mean obviously that's why the KKK is still exists. Yeah. And what's the alternative? I mean, what's the alternative? We would all love the KKK to go away. We would all love there to be, not all of us, but most sane people don't want racism to exist. But should we not let people meet? Should we be bugging people? Should we force people to do something they don't want to do? I mean, I just don't, I just fundamentally do not believe in that. I don't want people to be racist. I don't want people to be homophobic or transphobic. But the idea that the government can use its authority to make people do all of these things I just think is absolutely crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:52:47       So whether they decided to intentionally inflame this or not by finding people that, that weren't going to do it. If you really, if you're listening to this right now and you're getting married, you know you're getting gay, married, um, or untraditional, he married as they call it, you're doing that and you live in Alabama and there's only one baker there and he doesn't want to bake a cake. It sucks. It does suck. But what you might want to do is what I said about an hour ago, which is maybe leave that town like maybe take your skills, whatever, whatever worth you bring to a community and move to a bigger town where there probably is some of their do it or order a cake online. I mean the technological part that you just mentioned that you can now tweet about stuff and go, don't go, don't go. Like we have power as people. And the idea that we outsource all the decision making to the government is extremely dangerous. I mean, every, every horror in human history is a government doing things basically, you know, as long as governments have pretty much existed, it's not bands of Nice individual people that disagree on some stuff murdering.

Speaker 3:          01:53:45       Yeah. I mean, I understand your position and I'm with you to a certain extent. Uh, I wish there was a clean answer. There's no clean answer, but freedom is not clean. That's the, yeah. Yeah. I mean even the freedom to be a piece of shit. Yeah. And to be racist and to be sexist or homophobic or whatever it is. And you know, we, we have to define what that is and the first place, right? Like who by whose definition is something homophobic or by WHO's deaf? And I mean, is it homophobic or is it religious freedom? Like if, if, you know, if someone is deeply religious and their religion discriminates against gay people, are they discriminatory or are they religious? You have to give me an example of what they were actually doing. Like you're allowed to hate gay people. You, you are, I hope that you do not,

Speaker 2:          01:54:30       and I actually think this is somewhere where the conservatives have moved. I really do think they have moved. There's virtually no mainstream conservative that's screaming about gay marriage anymore. Even Mike Huckabee who sort of irrelevant or like that, that the Christian conservative side of that, they pretty much have ted Cruz, what does he say about gay marriage anymore? But that's again why rand Paul should have led or the the real, the true conservatives that believe in limited government should have led the charge on this. So this is where the progressive's did do something right years ago because they were fighting for real equality because real equality means you should be able to marry whoever you want. They weren't going for extra rights for anyone. Now they're going for extra rights because we all have equality. Doesn't mean we all have equal everything, but we have to have equality under the law. That's all the government can provide you. And then once you have that, some of us are going to be born into more money, right? Like your kids are going to have more money then you did right. Fact should they be punished for that?

Speaker 3:          01:55:26       A lot of people would say yes, he was a lot of, we do think that, yeah. I mean, look, I don't believe you should be able to give your kids money when you die. We'll do

Speaker 2:          01:55:35       the estate tax. I'm mostly, I hope that I'll be able to make enough money in my life that that will be a problem, but it will be a problem for you for sure. Short of you go bust on everything you're doing, which I'm assuming is not going to happen. Do you think at the end of your life that you've paid taxes your whole life, you've paid payroll taxes because you have employees, you've done all of these things, you've done everything right as a citizen, do you think at the end of the day the government should be able to come in and take something like 55% of your money at that?

Speaker 5:          01:56:00       No. That's creepy. It's creepy that they're able to do that. To take money from taxed money. Yeah, so the money's already been taxed for your whole life. Yeah. You earned that money and then they're going to tax it on top of that, but that's a mainstream democratic talking points. It's one of those things where they're dealing with the redistribution of wealth that that conversation, the redistribution of wealth is super slippery because like who's going to redistribute it and to who and like when do you decide that someone has too much money or what? You know, what's the standard, what's the metric and what what, what occupation are we going to, we are we only going to go after the bankers and we're going to go after artists as well. Like what if someone's a successful artist and we're going to take all their money are we're going to remove incentive for success? There's a certain line that you're going to cross where you shouldn't be more successful because they're going to tax you harder if we're going to keep people in some, some, some sort of an artificially constructed glass ceiling to avoid being taxed like it's a real weird,

Speaker 2:          01:57:01       I hate to tell you, but everything you just said there is completely against what Democrats basically are for. They are for the estate tax. I mean the bold why, what's the argument? The argument is you died and now in the greater good, which is, which is a phrase that sounds really good but it's, but it's your, your face pretty much summed it up. It never leads to good. Well we can, okay let's just give more money to this thing that wastes money on everything at that has no accountability. This giant money churning monster. Yeah. That's the real issue, right, is that this thing doesn't have accountability and that it does waste a shitload of money. Think about this. If the government was slim and trim and effective and you know, we were all tax right and it was transparent and effective and functional, there would be no reason to be a libertarian.

Speaker 2:          01:57:44       I'd be sitting here going, I'm for government. You know what I mean? Like if it really operated in a slim way, but what the government doesn't do anything good. Name one problem you could possibly have in your life, Joe Rogan that you'd be like, get me, get the government to solve this. Did they do the post office? Well, no. What? Like what do they do? Well they do. The Post Office is pretty good actually, but guess what? If the post office closes tomorrow, it will be all right. You'd still get mail, Amazon pick note. When Amazon was, say us through ups, it would cost a lot more. He wouldn't though. Competition would start kicking in and between ups and Fedex and Amazon and drones and Blah, blah, blah and DHL, they'd all start. I would probably drop prices because right now we've just got this artificial thing that sits there that then allows them to price according to that, but if you drop that, why is the government in that business anymore? I have three chickens. I've really done the Joe Rogan lifestyle here over the last couple of years, but I have three chickens right now. We had, I'm going to give you a good ups story. We ordered them. They were born August on a Monday

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       in a cleveland. They hatch that day. They threw him in a box with a little hole you sps, and they showed up at my door in La on a Tuesday. The USBS has been doing that for about a hundred. The only way you can do it, by the way, you can't order chickens through any other methods suggests usbs. Yeah, so actually I was given the usbs credit there cause my chickens all arrived live. Yeah, they send the checks. Yeah, you're, you're buying these live checks. That's the way you get them to the US Postal Service. I'm pretty sure though that if the u sps stopped, it didn't exist anywhere. You'd still get chickens delivered and Amazon and could probably do it even more effectively. That's my point. It's like I'm not saying these things have to be eliminated tomorrow. I'm not even really calling for them to be eliminated. But just generally what problem would you, everything you were building here right now, right?

Speaker 1:          01:59:26       Do you want the government to tell you how to do all these things and all the regulations that you got to have your electric thing this far from this and like all have regulations like that for construction are important though. You don't have to make sure that people don't do stupid shit, but a power lines near a water line. There's a lot of, but I would put most of that on the builder's though. They want to build things that are good. Now I get hauled. That's not true. Listen, people don't know. People are going to build all the time like you have to have regulations when it comes to construction methods where people are going to get fucked, they cut regulate. They cut corners when there aren't regulations anyway. They do. They would cut a lot more if there weren't regulated. I'm not totally third world countries and look at construction methods.

Speaker 1:          02:00:04       They're fucking dangerous. That's why schools collapse on kids and foreign countries sometimes like, well, I'm not complete. I'm not telling you that I'm against all regulation period. That's where, but that's where I said intellectually, I like that argument because you could make us, I think you can make a very sound argument that competition would force people to do better work. Like if you're a plumber, you have a vested interest in doing the best plumbing job you can so that people were rate you on Yelp so that you will get more work. You don't have a vested interest in cutting corners. Now you might write, you're going to push it as much as you can to save as much time and energy and money as you can, but once you go over that edge, yeah, you don't want to be known as the guy that the, you tighten something too much that you flooded the house or when you're building a house.

Speaker 1:          02:00:44       Thinking logically though, when when people fuck things up and short things and do things terrible, they're not thinking logically, but I don't think it's the government. I don't think it's the government that they're like, the government gave me this regulation so that's why I'm going to do it. Right. Well, you know, didn't have any regulations. That would be no incentive whatsoever to do it. Right. No. There would be an incentive knew there were no inspectors, no one was going to check their stuff and make sure that their stuff was up to code. Listen, man, I was in no instruction my whole life. My Dad was an architect. I've been in construction since I was a little kid. You fucking need regulations. These guys, a lot of people that are in construction there, they'll do whatever the fuck they can to make money and it's not good for the people that have the house because they might have that house for five, 10 years before that problem manifests itself. The people who are establishing these codes are licensed builders or people that have been involved in construction for a long fucking time and they know what's safe and what's safe. That's why

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       those codes exist. It exists to protect the consumers. You can't just protect the consumers through the marketplace because so I'm not calling all the time for these problems to become a real issue and these problems could potentially damage everybody in the neighborhood. It's not just going to affect the person on this one lot like of a fire starts, it burns all the houses in the neighborhood or if a flood happens and it floods everyone downhill, it's, it's a real problem. Like you have to be real careful with construction. I get it and you know, my dad wasn't in construction so I'm not privy to like all of that, the little stuff. But I genuinely believe that as a general level people have a vested interest in, especially now because of phones and apps and yelp and all of them doing good work because that's how you will get more work.

Speaker 3:          02:02:25       You are, you're never going to remove the people who will do shotty, shitty malicious shit, but you can keep them at bay with regulation. I think this is where I'd say you can hate it. Some regulation, educated, regulate regulation, people who actually understand what's going on and you know, make sure that someone doesn't do something stupid with a power line or someone do something stupid with the, the way they constructed main beams where the, they're just subject to collapse. I that's important because most people buying a house, I don't know what the fuck they're looking for. Most people getting a house built, they have no idea about construction methods and they need someone to inspect things and make sure that it's up to code. That's why code exists. It's very important. Yeah, I saw, I'm not, I'm not totally with you on that. Like I do think Mo, I think most of it, probably 90% of it would be who has the most vested interest to build a good house.

Speaker 3:          02:03:14       It's the builder because he wants more work. He doesn't want the house to collapse because then he'll be added. I'm telling you, man, I got you. I got you though. I get it. Then he's got not just cops. There's a specific thing. It's a dangerous thing too, because it's where you sleep. It's where your kids sleep. It's, it's, you know, you just, I think there's a lot of idealistic notions about deregulation and I think there's, there's some consumer protection has to be put in place because people don't have the time to spend all this time researching construction methods and making sure everything's done correctly and be there and make sure that the joists are a certain width and they have a certain amount of support. Like all that stuff has to be done by people who understand code, assuming that the government regulators understand code correctly and aren't just on the take or just try, you know, you know, just basically just taking money and signing off on things.

Speaker 3:          02:04:07       I mean, house Spec things, man. If you ever had a construction project done. Yeah, well I got my house last year and we had to go through all the inspections and had several guys come back and we didn't build it. Now there's a big difference between insurance inspector and a code inspector. Code inspectors are very different when you're having a house built. And I've had construction projects where I had to explain to people and go through it with, with builders. They're there making sure that the house is in fucking fall on you, that the power lines, you know, are, are done correctly, that all the electricity done

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       correctly, the pipes, uh, late incorrectly, your septic system, where your sewage system has done correctly. Do you think that could be privatized then? See, cause again, I'm not, I'm just, I just think it's an regulations. How would it, how would you could have the company no incentive. Well No, you could have companies that would, that their job would be to make sure to inspect. Yeah. And you wouldn't have, they wouldn't have the thread of law to, to enforce these things. Like if someone is, if someone is building something and they're not up to code, they lose their license and they can't build. If you privatized it, what's the incentive for them to follow the guidelines? Yeah. So this is, this is where I'm not telling you that I'm calling for all this. I just think intellectually it's just an interesting space to, to argue something.

Speaker 4:          02:05:20       Cause I think that there's more the more that you can give to people to freely do what they think is right. I think generally they will. Like again, I get it. There's going to be some real shitty construction people out there you don't think you should have on to talk about this. And I think people have looped you in before is you're on Brooke from uh, from mine ran institute. He's, cause he's no only sweet began with no, no. All right. So I'll be happy if they have, I'm pay attention. Okay. So I'll, I'll be happy to do it. He's a really interesting guy whose mother was thinking a little bit on this. Those iron brand people are fucking harsh. They like ideas, man. Those are, they're not the most fun people on the there on the planet. But I generally, I generally liked them because they just want their kind of live and let live.

Speaker 4:          02:05:59       That's really it. Like that's like the crux of it pretty much. Is that really the crux of it or I mean, yeah, people think that there's like sort of a cruelty aspect to it. I ran philosophy, well they believe in, in rational self interest, which if you say self, it makes people think you're evil. But, but we all basically operate in rational self interest all the time. Right. But espousing it with us, the thing, it's like proclaiming it is a thing that people go, oh, you're, you're, you're essentially setting up the idea of the Gordon Gekko idea. Greed is good. I kind of buy into that idea. Do you buy into greed is good. Yeah. Basically not greed to destroy the world. But if you do you joe, do what is good for you. And by extension greed, well that's [inaudible] ambition. Well, all right. Exactly. That's my point, right?

Speaker 4:          02:06:45       Where it gets conflated, isn't it? Right. So with, so without wiggling it to the definition of greed versus ambition, it's like you do what's good for you, but, but, but it doesn't mean you're just running this like rampaging program to destroy the world in the name of Joe Rogan. You're doing what's good for you because you actually like your audience and you want them to learn you. You want to have money so that your family can live in a house that you can afford, that you can send your kids to good schools and all of those things. That's all rational self interest. If at the same time you were running a nuclear power plant and you are Mr. Burns and you were dumping in the river, well no, that's actually no longer rational self interest because now you're polluting the very environment that you live in. So rational, I mean the key takes care of that. Who regulates that? So they, so generally comes in. So those guys, I don't want to speak for a little, gets you in trouble if you, in your opinion, if you're, you're this deregulation

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       guy who goes after you when you dump shit into the river.

Speaker 2:          02:07:39       So I'm not saying there should be no regulation. I just was saying that I like this. Generally I like this line of thinking there has to be some regulation. I agree you can't. But what I would say is, you know, that's where the regulation comes in and the environment. Yeah. That, I would say there has to be some, but I've had some interesting people on conservatives who are dealing with doing uh, environmental stuff from a conservative perspective that there's ways to make money actually in green stuff, in green products and in Al Gore. Yeah. Well, look, yeah, he's been, I don't know that he's creating anything other than movies, but he's making me make a lot of money, a lot of money in green corporations. Right. So that, but that's him doing it privately,

Speaker 3:          02:08:15       right? Yeah. Yeah. But what is like, what's the solution if someone pollutes, if you're not going to have regulation, what is the solution? If someone does something that's illegal?

Speaker 2:          02:08:25       Well, if you're not going to have regulation, he wouldn't be illegal. But your question is,

Speaker 3:          02:08:28       well, it's illegal dump, dump things into the river, right? I mean, it's just illegal. That's not a matter of regulation. I mean, polluting, we'll willful poisoning of rivers.

Speaker 2:          02:08:39       I'm sure he's actually terrorism. It would be a bunch of like, so what those guys would argue is what I said before, which is that ultimately, especially now because of technology, like in the old days, so like every time someone cuts regulation, I've heard Bill Maher say this a lot, they're going to start a polluting the river immediately. That implies that these businessmen, whatever their, you know, where they're, whatever they are, whatever industry that they're in, that they're immediately going to be like, Huh, the regulations gone start polluting the water. We live in a time now where everyone's walking around with an iphone where maybe 50 years ago you could've got away with a lot of bad shit, right? Coal miners that we're breathing, all kinds of horrible shit that nobody was ever going to find out about where now everybody is walking around with snapchat and instagram and blah, blah blah. So a lot of this stuff would be exposed more so that all of the things that we've been talking about for the last couple of hours about, about people getting involved, a lot of the things I think would start self regulating. But again, and then I won't say it again. I'm not for just deregulating everything. I just think there's probably better ways to do it than just having the government come in and say, this is what you gotta do and now figure it out because the government isn't that good at most things.

Speaker 3:          02:09:48       Yeah, I know what you're saying there. But, uh, I do think that obviously there has to be laws in place, uh, specifically laws in place that protect people from someone doing something and it's going to damage all the other people in the community.

Speaker 2:          02:10:01       Yeah. Well, by the way, that, so you can do that from the government supposed to protect your life and your property. I mean, that's a very simple libertarian thing, you know what I mean? Like, so that there's a good argument there for why you could have some level of regulation. Right.

Speaker 3:          02:10:13       But I don't think it's just like specifically in terms of like someone polluting rivers. I don't think it's good enough to snap chat about it. I think people should be locked up and go to jail if they find out that someone's dumping toxic waste into the river because it's too expensive to process it and get it removed and put in some place where it's, it's, you know, safe.

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       That's a crime.

Speaker 2:          02:10:35       Yeah. Well I'm all for finding those people and having the company's fire them and all those things. As far as putting them in jail, I don't know that I'm glad come up. Yeah. I don't know that I'm getting them off the streets. Take the money, give it to Bernie's kids. I'm not a fan of putting more people in jail generally. But

Speaker 5:          02:10:50       yeah. No, I'm not either. You know, I think that's one of the more interesting things that happened in this administration is when Kim Kardashian got that lady incredible generated or whatever, he did got a release to get her sentence commuted. That's Kinda crazy. Like she showed up and she presented this case about some woman who's, uh, been in jail for, she's essentially jail for life for nonviolent drug offense. Right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:11:15       And how many other people are like her for non violent drug? A pen this long, doing something with your own body.

Speaker 5:          02:11:21       Yeah, well that's where we're full and total agreement. I just think that this idea that the pharmaceutical companies can sell drugs, but people can't sell drugs that they can, they're responsible for the UN untenable. The unimaginable number of people that have died from opiate withdrawal or opiate, um, overdoses. Fentanyl. I mean, fentanyl. Just last year we lost Tom Petty. We lost prince. Um, couple of other people too. I can't remember. There's some other famous people that died from fentanyl. Um, uh, Patton, Oswald's wife, she was another fentanyl. This, it's like, it's a horrible, horrible, horrible drug and no one's clamoring for these people to go to jail

Speaker 2:          02:12:07       scratching drugs all day long. You go watch cable news all day long. What are they selling all day long? Prescription drugs with a zillion side effects that are seemingly far worse, including thoughts of suicide and depression and blah, blah, blah. Then the original thing they're trying to treat. So look when specifically opiates. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:12:24       it's of the day, the real deadly ones. And then you think about how many people that are in jail right now for marijuana, how many people that are in jail for cocaine, how many in jail people are in jail for psychedelics? MTMA mean it's, there's no comparison in terms of the amount of damage done per capita.

Speaker 2:          02:12:39       I, I completely agree. Look when when the thing happened with Roseanne and then she blamed ambient or she at least said she was on Ambien, you know the Ambien, the parent company, whatever it was, they tweeted out something like there are a lot of side effects but it doesn't make you racist. But knowing how Glib and ridiculous that was. Yes. No one is saying that ambien makes you racist, but ambien does have a litany of, I don't know, 50 side effects it, you know, sleepwalking saying crazy things, eating, you know, literally just being unable to control what you're doing while you're on ambien being in this Zombie like state. So is it possible that even though she has also said that she didn't realize that Valerie Jarret was black, which I actually kind of do believe. I don't know. I sent it to me. Yeah. I don't know her. I know, I know. I mean, I know her a little bit. So

Speaker 5:          02:13:24       she didn't think she was black. I believe her. I believe her 100% but look, she said dumb shit in the, the Susan Rice

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       thing was much more egregious to one where she said that a Susan right rice was a man. Eight balls. Yeah, no. Yeah. So I'm not defending what rue events at all I'm saying is that Ambien, the maker sends out this Glib tweet, like we don't make people racists, but guess what? You have people doing all kinds of crazy shit that they can, having conversations, people have driven their cars and the wrong side of the highway. People who have done all kinds of crazy shit on there. Right. So is it possible that made her impaired enough to have a stupid thought and then 100% yeah, it's 100% there's definitely side effects. The, whether or not they're responsible for those side effects is where it gets into the realm of personal responsibility. Like, if you take ambien and you do something, are you responsible for it? No.

Speaker 3:          02:14:15       Yes. What are we going to say? If you drink and you go commit a violent crime, are you responsible for, we all agree, yes. So it gets real strange. You know, it gets real strange. I mean that, that's one of the weird things when it comes to gender and responsibility because there's been so many issues of men and women, particular, it's almost always men and women. You never hear about these from gay couples, but men and women or I haven't heard about it, at least men and women, uh, getting drunk and having sex and then the man gets accused of sexual assault. And this has gotten so weird that a guy, um, preemptively guy and a girl got had sex and the guy, um, called the police and wanted her charge was sexual assault because he was drunk. And he did it as a preemptive measure because he was worried that she was going to come after him.

Speaker 3:          02:15:00       And so the university took action against the girl and I'm like, Jesus Christ. And we play in little stupid games. And pretending that girls rape guys when they're drunk or that it's really devastating for the guy. Like what the fuck are we doing? We are going to criminalize everything. We're going to criminalize every, I think of all of the stupid things you've done in your life, whether on drugs or not or whether we when you were in college or not involved. Now add social media to that. Add the the amount of pictures that people send to each other and everything else. If we don't stop this attic control monster, we are all just going to destroy each other. But there's a gray area because we know that some people do take advantage of people that are drunk. Like if someone was, if someone was like porn drunk drinks down someone's face and they were sober and they were doing it with the intention of raping them once they were intoxicated and they couldn't consent anymore, that's one thing.

Speaker 3:          02:15:47       But if two people are getting together and drinking and then having sex and then the woman has regret in the morning when she sobers up. So she decides that it was rape because she and he were both drunk. That's preposterous. But we don't have this ability to rationally process each and individual. Each individual case. By the way, here's something that trump did that was really good. He got rid of those ridiculous title nine laws that Obama in stated where they were basically having these clown courts in colleges that you could go to them and instead of having due process, which is perhaps the most important piece of, of a functioning western free society where you are innocent until proven guilty. They were suspending male students just by accusations and then it was leaking. I had Laura Kipnis

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       on who's a professor that they were, she was fighting against title nine so then they brought up title nine charges against her. I mean there's, and there's many, many other stories on this. That's something that Obama brought in that trump actually got rid of that evil. What's her name? [inaudible] Betsy devoss got rid of. So it's like we've, we've just gotten to the point where we've politicized everything. We've politicized our own capacity to be free and make decisions for ourselves. If you get drunk and are fooling around with somebody, some of that's on you, you might regret it. And the next one, we, every, every single one of us listening to this has had sex with someone or done drugs with someone or something. Woke up the next morning and be like, fuck, I shouldn't have done that Jamie. Jamie's clean. Um, except here's my thing. I was thinking about driving.

Speaker 1:          02:17:16       If you drive in, you're drunk. No one says you're exonerated because you're drunk, right? No, man, you are drunk and fucked up and you did something drunk. You're responsible for your actions. But if you have sex drunk, all of a sudden for some strange reason, you're not responsible for your actions. That's preposterous. It doesn't, they don't match up. It's not, it doesn't make any sense. Yeah. But again, this is where the, the identity politics of all this ruins everything. Because you're not saying that anyone that gets drunk, you're saying if a girl really, although that one example that you gave is true. That's like a curriculum. It's a complete throw away. Ridiculous. Shows you how fucking stupid the university is that they let that fly. They should've smacked him. Send it back to class. Smack him in the face. Yeah, Sun right back to class.

Speaker 1:          02:17:57       Congratulations Buddy. He's got laid. Yeah, good for you. You were drunk and the girl took advantage of your penis. Did you orgasm? You did. Shut the fuck up. Get out of here. What are you doing? It's, it's ridiculous. Across the board. It's a far more ridiculous though. When a guy is accusing, and let's just be honest about this, it's far more ridiculous when a guy is accusing a girl of rape in those circumstances, and I don't want to hear all your progressive nonsense screaming and yelling and no, it's not. We're all equal. Fuck you. It's not the same of a guy does that to a girl. If a guy purposely gets a girl drunk and does it because he knows that she wouldn't consent any other way. And then gets her department. She's like, oh, and she's barely conscious and fucks her. In my opinion.

Speaker 1:          02:18:39       That's rape. Yeah, and my opinion that that person, but if a couple gets together and they have a few drinks, they're laughing, they're flirting, and they make out and then they go back to her place or his place and they have sex. It's not rape. We know it's not rape. All right, so let's split the difference on that one. So now it's a, it's a sorority party. In College, the girls decide they're going to drop Ruthie's in a couple of the guys' things late at night. Girls are just, you know, let's just, I don't know what the girls look like. Right? Okay. So girls look good, right? So, right. So a bunch of hot chicks now there, they drug these guys. I mean, I'm sure this has happened. This is definitely never heard of it. If you're sure it's happened. It's got to have happened. They roofie to guy. I'm sure a guy has been, I'm pretty sure I got roof by a girl in college. Now I'm married to a dude. So who knows what's going on. Me, she fucked her brain up. She, she seriously, it was some high level

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       Ruthie Shit. I was like, we went all night and then I was like, you know what, I've had just about enough of this, enough of this gal stuff. You really got roofie by girl. I was roofied once in college. I like just like a keg party. What'd you like? Who did it? I don't know who did it. I don't have much of a recollection of it other than I remember I had like half a beer. I could not really think. And I remember I couldn't stand. Did you realize something was wrong and try to get it out of there. I knew something was wrong, but your mind doesn't operate correctly. And I remember I was Kinda, I remember my friends were there, but we were all like stoners at the time. So I don't even know that. I was like thinking clearly like something you don't realize fully.

Speaker 4:          02:20:03       You don't, you know something's not right, but you're like, at least what happened to me was I just couldn't like put all the pieces together. You get tested, do you find out what it was now? I mean I remember, I remember at one point just sitting on a couch in the corner. I remember a very bright lamp light above me out. I have no recollection of how I got home or like any of that. But it also makes 20 years roofing all like why, why wouldn't you think it's, how do you say it, hip and all something. How do you say that? Let's just say Ruthie, Ruthie. What makes you think it was that and not like, oh I don't know. Maybe, well cause I didn't trip. I mean I wasn't, you know, I've tripped, I've done that stuff. What does that other stuff that people give or ge or something like that?

Speaker 4:          02:20:39       Yeah. Like I don't think I was in like a k hole or I've never done that. I don't think I was in that kind of state. I was just in this, like my body kind of couldn't move, you know, little aura kind of stuff. Bright light and like I kind of couldn't think straight that that's the way I would describe it. But I've, I mean, I've done mushrooms, I've done most things that are out here. I wasn't hallucinating in any way, so, but, but just playing that went out for a second. If a girl did that to a guy, managed to get him hard, fuck them. Right. I think you think it's the same thing. You walk it off, walk it off policy. Those are my four words. Suck it up, suck it up, get off. You got you got laid.

Speaker 5:          02:21:19       Yeah. It's not good. It's definitely not good for anybody to take advantage of someone's body and particularly give them a drug and where they can't Dev no control and then raped them. Yeah. It's the same thing. If a girl does it to a guy, it is the same thing. She roof, he's the guy and has sex. And especially what if the guy has a girlfriend and he doesn't want to have sex with her or you know, fill in the blank. He's not attracted to her or he's gay and you do that to him and he's repulsed by it. Yeah, it's right. Yeah. Yeah. But you know, now we're in the realm of Bill Cosby, right? The bill cosby situation is fucking break, right? Yeah. 100%. No doubt. It's a big difference between that and a couple that gets together and has a couple of drinks. Have you heard it from a gay perspective, like two gay guys getting drunk and having sex and one of the guy's accusing the other one of sexual assault because he was drunk?

Speaker 4:          02:22:05       Well, I've definitely heard of the first part, two gay guys getting drunk and hepatitis. I've heard any of the events that's happened a lot. Uh, the rape one,

Speaker 5:          02:22:13       I haven't heard it that I've heard so many stories about a woman in this one story about a man claiming that he was sexually assaulted because they were drunk. I've never heard it about two gay guys.

Speaker 4:          02:22:23       I actually do know one of a guy, um, that was given something, that gift that was given something. Yeah, but not two guys not willingly got drunk and then, no, not that. I definitely have people been given. Sure can attack 100% that that's probably just a guy thing. Fucking dark thing. Man, that's a dark thing that people are willing to do that that caused me, thinks, shook me to my fucking core. The idea that this guy who was America's sweetheart, America's dad was possibly the greatest series, not the Russians or the greatest, but one of the worst serial rapists of all time, if not the worst. Did we we, the first time I came on, we talked about cosby. He's the reason I got into comedy at four years old, I think it was 1981 or 1982 maybe I was five. I saw a bill cosby himself on HBO.

Speaker 4:          02:23:11       I remember sitting in the, in my family room buckled over and laughing to the point, you know, when you just your whole body, you cannot pain in my stomach. And I remember thinking, I want to be funny. And now my comedy hero is basically the biggest serial rapist of all time. What the fuck, man? I used to have cosby records hanging up in my house even to three years ago, and eventually as the story started leaking out, I have one of his great records and I, at first I was like, I'm just going to leave it up. Like it doesn't change my feelings about him as a comic. And then I remember people would be coming into my house, oh, you got gotta be over there. You should do you just take it and then put bars over it. That's what I should do. I bet you that leave it up there, but bars over it.

Speaker 4:          02:23:52       Yeah. I might do this just so fucked. Like how could he, how could he be that guy? How could he be the guy who is so funny and everybody loves them and also be the guy that that drugs people and rape some. It's like what a dark, dark, dark secret. I mean, I think Jordan would have a lot to say on this stuff that we, these inconsistencies that we live with that often drive us and that, you know, why did we find out that that, you know, these people preaching about morals or all the time are the same people that are doing all this weird shit or that we've all done things that we're not proud of or whatever it is. And it's like that's part of being a human. It's just part. Yeah. Yeah. You're talking about the evil, I mean, someone who's doing this into his fucking sixties he was doing this, but he gets, it becomes an addiction.

Speaker 4:          02:24:34       Like anything else like you or your mind, I'm sure, I'm sure people do studies on this about what happens to the actual brain chemistry when you're doing these things that I would guess it has something to do with the dopamine levels that are released at the same time when, when you know somebody's snorting coke and doing whatever they're doing, you know, whatever it is, I don't know what it is, but it's just so stunning to me. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's a, and again this is, it goes back to laws or there's a need to protect people, but there's also a need to go, hey, college boy who got drunk and had sex with a girl who was also drunk. He didn't get raped. Fuck off. It's, it's really disrespectful to people that actually had been raped, you know? And I get, it's kind of funny that he's turning the tables and he's doing it to her. I think there was a story, part of the store was something about, she had done it to one of his friends.

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       She had said that to one of his friends. So he's preemptively doing it because he thought that she was gonna come after him now.

Speaker 2:          02:25:29       Well, part of it is that it's gross, that it's all public, right? Like everything has become so public. And I think that that's part of the problem all the time. Like who banged who in college? The idea that that now is like this thing that gets written about and people get interviewed on all of these things. Like, again, all of that is kind of dangerous and that's why I try all the time. And I think what you usually do is you usually talk about ideas not people cause it's the underlying philosophical ideas that matter. Not the specifics of this kid. I mean you didn't pull up the picture of the kid and mentioned the girl's name and hers are twitter and all that, but that it's the underlying philosophical issues of why are we doing this? Why are we exposing everybody? Why are we attacking and destroying everybody and all of that. That, that's much more interesting to me. Then just the specifics of the people or you know, all the people that I'm so sick of all these blue check writers and buzzfeed people. Like I never called them out specifically like that guy. I hate that guy. Cause like he, that guys, nobody during the business of writing. Right.

Speaker 5:          02:26:28       You know, I think a lot of it is, I mean we can decide that these people are enemy, but like we're in some ways photos on the battlefield. You know, I just, in a very perverse way, in a very perverse way, and I don't, I just think it's just like their job is to write about things and when we're involved in a story, they find an angle and they go after it. Just like I do with jokes. Like when I, if I crack a joke about somebody else, I do a bit about someone else hate them. Like I had this whole bit about, um, Bruce Jenner and the Kardashians. What led bruce to become a woman because I hated him. It's cause it was, I thought it was funny. Yeah. I thought is there's an angle there. It's a story. It's a big thing that's on people's minds.

Speaker 5:          02:27:12       And so it became a target for me the same way it is when a lot of these folks write articles and you know, a lot of them are in their twenties and you know, they're idealistic or they're young and evolving their thoughts and maybe they wouldn't write that article five years from now or 10 years from now, whatever. And we don't think we have to take that into consideration as well. These people are embarking on a career in journalism and you know, for a lot of them shitting on Jordan Peterson gets them social brownie points. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:27:43       You know what, you want to shift topics for sure. Can we do a little mid shift there? Sure. We can do a little mid ship. So I was talking to Jordan about something that I think is kind of interesting that I haven't talked about publicly before and I thought if I'm going to come on Joe Rogan, let me see if I can bust out something kind of personal. So you know, Jordan was having all these autoimmune problems and that's kind of what led him to, uh, to doing this crazy diet where he in effect is on the carnivore diet. Yeah. Like it's like meat. That's it feel doing that. Great. He looks so much better. Even even then, probably last time he was here, maybe what, four or five months ago, he, he, his skin looks good. He looks, he's got some color back in his face.

Speaker 2:          02:28:18       You know, he's definitely lost some weight, slimmed down a little bit, but, but in a good way. His energy, his back. Um, he just, his hair looks better. Like he just looks better. Like I don't know all the science behind the carnivore diet of whether you can do it forever and not eat vegetables and truly survive. I don't know where you're getting the rest of the nutrition that you need and the rest of the vitamins and all that. But, but when I've gone out to dinner with him over these things, guy gets a freaking the biggest steak you can imagine at every place. Chops it up, eats meat. That's it. Um, so anyway, so we were talking the other day in the green room before the show that it's interesting that he had this health problem as his success was growing and it's like you don't really think about that in life because we all like to think like as we're growing and getting better and doing what we're supposed to do, that our health is kind of in line with that.

Speaker 2:          02:29:06       So, I've actually never talked about this before, but about two and a half years ago, right when my show was really taking off, I think probably about the first time we, we did our first sit down, so not the one last year but two in about two and half years ago as I was for also first getting hate online at the same time I started losing tons of chunks of hair, tons. Like I'd be in the shower. Yeah. And tons of hair would be everywhere after I showered hair in my towels and everything and lost like huge patches back of my head, up top, like all over the place. So I had a al or I have, I guess I technically still have it, alopecia areata where it's an autoimmune thing. They don't know why your white blood cells start attacking your hair follicles. Um, so I went about two years ago and again, this is just as I'm like starting to really succeed.

Speaker 2:          02:29:52       Like I'm really just like breaking through for the first time. And uh, I went on this like crazy experimental drug. So usually when you have this, they just shoot cortisone into your cortico corticosteroids into your head and they hope that that basically reverses it or stops or whatever reduces the inflammation that's causing us something like that. And, but my case was so severe that I went to, I found this doctor who's doing this really experimental thing, we're in effect, they're putting something like poison ivy on your head so that your white blood cells will attack that instead of attacking your hair follicles. And the hope is if you do just the slight amount that's necessary that you won't have like crazy reactions and you'll be, and your hair eventually grow back. Anyway. I did it for about a year and first off when I was on camera, I mean there were points where like I was like, oh my God, like I don't, I can't be on academy more.

Speaker 2:          02:30:43       I was doing like, not spray hair but like powdered shit and like grew out my hair to like hide so that we'll later I can show you. Like I still actually do have some spots here. Um, but anyway I went under this experimental stuff and literally for two years, virtually my entire body was broken out like red, itchy, Gross, disgusting. My head was like, like terrific years. Yeah, for like a year bad and then and then a year not as bad but like Ge, like oozing my head like as if you had poison ivy. I was literally basically putting poison ivy on my head and like I was sensitive to heat and light and like it was, it was a truly misery. I had like a real, oh I gained weight because of it. Cause it likes screws up. You're like my, my neck actually look thicker.

Speaker 2:          02:31:30       Like I look at videos where I did not look good for a year. Like I look kind of bloated because my body was basically having like an allergic reaction at all times. I was putting something on my head to cause my body to have an allergic reaction like it for whatever reason I was just very sensitive to it. But anyway, I bring this all up. Hey Cause I've never talked about it and I thought it would might just be something to like throw out there. But B, what I've discussed with Jordan is just this interesting idea of sort of as you're succeeding and as you're doing what you're supposed to be doing, that life just throws you weird things. And I'm, I'm pretty much over it now. I'll show you later. Like I definitely have some stuff still that, um, now I'm just taking the injections and we'll see what happens.

Speaker 2:          02:32:08       Um, but don't you think it's stress related? Yeah, so I'd really Jordan doing the float tanks. Now I'm doing the Saunas. I get massages every couple of weeks now. Um, I'm definitely trying. That's why I did the month off. Jordan was not famous his whole life now. And then in his fifties became famous. That is not, it's a not a normal state that people are accustomed to. Even a clinical psychologist and a professor and a professor. And you know, there's, I mean, how many stories do we have to read about people who go famous and lose their fucking marbles? Yeah. It's not an easy road. It's not, it's not easy to handle. People ask him about that. So when we do the q and a at the end there's an APP that people submit questions and then I just kind of moderate it. So I picked some funny ones and then I picked some serious ones.

Speaker 2:          02:32:52       But a lot of the questions are asked him directly about that, about what it, what pressure do you feel now that you're famous, what is, what if you screw up, what if a lot, you know they also ask them what lot, which I think is a great question and, and I don't want to paraphrase his answer because I won't do it justice, but they ask him, you know, you talk about religion and archetypes and all that, are you a profit? They will ask him now, not because they're saying he's a prophet, but like if you believe in all of this stuff, if you believe that product you factor in, right. And he, he goes out of his way to say he doesn't believe that. And he's not trying to make anyone drink koolaid. He's trying to help have them live the best life for themself, not in life that he's laying out for them.

Speaker 2:          02:33:28       Um, but, but watching him go through all this, it's just been, it's been truly fascinating. Like it really, it's like, and then I think I said it before, but it like the whole thing is like this love fest. It's not what they want it to be. It's not the people that are writing all of these pieces and who often, I invite a lot of the writers sometimes that right things. I'll be like, you want to come to the show tonight at any of them are welcome to come as my guests. They can sit right up front. I'll do the exact same thing, Jordan. We'll do the exact, so you know what's good about those people. What's good about is the same thing that I try to do with all my material. I look at it and I learned this from Doug. Stan hope, Doug Stan hope actually said it to me and I realized I kind of do it, but from him saying it, I did it more. He said, you should write your bits as if you're a defense attorney, like you're defending your bit like right. Your bit like as if

Speaker 5:          02:34:18       you, and so I, I think that one of the things about having haters out there or critics out there is that they're examining your material, finding holes in it. And I think if you go over all of your material and all of your ideas from the perspective of someone is watching, I'm right now trying to find fault in everything that you do. You will find it. Just be undeniable. Just be undeniable. Find, find those holes, patch him up. And you know, there's going to be disagreements. It's not like you're always going to be able to state your point and it's going to be, uh, undeniable to someone who completely disagrees, you know, ideologically with your stance on whatever the fuck it is. But no, as long as you, it's undeniable to you, uh, you've, you've rationally made your case. You've objectively stated the facts. You've, you've, this is your position and this is why. And you could back it up. There's too much sloppy work going on where people think they can and you see this a lot, there's a lot on the progressive left or the regressive left or what do you want to call it, where they just expect that other people are just going to agree with their stance on things. So they, they, they have this sort of

Speaker 4:          02:35:23       will, this very rigid ideology that they're, they're trying to put out. They often think that they're morally right. Yeah. So then you don't have to do the leg work of the arguments. It's a lot harder to take a position that says you should be who you are and you have to fit that into society rather than saying, this is what the moral imperative is. This is why we need those laws. And if you deviate from that, you're the bad guy. So unfortunately they've just embraced that, I think too much. So it's like, it's like one of those things like when I go to these colleges and I'm usually invited by libertarians and it's like the returns want low taxes and limited government and live how you want to live. Right. That. That's the basics of it. But they'll often say, you know, I talk about low taxes in a college class and people say I'm racist.

Speaker 4:          02:36:07       And it's like, well, how does race get into that? But what they will say is that what they'll say is, well, wait a minute. If you want low taxes, that means you don't want money going to people who need it more. And often it is people of color who need it more. So you inherently are racist. You have to think on how to make the counter argument to that. The, I think there's a very valid counter argument that I buy into, but you have to think it's very easy to just take somebody who thinks the reverse of you and go, you're racist. You're race such such a lazy way to approach an idea. Yeah. Yeah. It's so lazy. The only thing I, I've a problem with what Jordan has been saying lately is this idea of enforced monogamy being the solution to insoles, these involuntary celibates that's not going to help. So what do you think the, I become men. Well, what do you think his definition of enforcement argument is? Just to be clear with the horse, monogamy were people, you know, the, the culture encourages and supports the idea of monogamy. Yeah. In effect, he's talking about Matt, he's just talking about marriage and that, but that's not going to clear that way

Speaker 5:          02:37:10       to people that no one wants to fuck. It's just not going to, the idea is that there's a bunch of men out there that are taking all the viable females

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       because no one's getting married and they're just, there's no room for these insoles. No. They are not attractive to women, whether they're not physically attractive. He told me Harvey Weinstein was physically attractive. That's fucking disgusting pig. Forget about what he did to those women are the rapes or the sexual assaults. He had a gorgeous wife. His wife is gorgeous. That was a voluntary relationship. Okay, so how did that happen? It happened through success. It happened through success and confidence and whatever the fuck else he's got intellect. I don't know what his mind's like. These, these insoles, they have to become men. Okay. And there's a word. It's all about that. I mean his whole message is right. I just don't think that enforced monogamy has any factor whatsoever in this. So he, I think he would say this, but I'm not as lawyer, but I think he used the phrase all he meant was marriage.

Speaker 3:          02:38:07       That generally societies that more people are married and let's just say married. So I think going to help. I think perhaps if he was being interviewed again by, by her, he would use a different phrase. Even if they, even if he says marriage, marriage is not going to help in cells. These guys that are involuntary celibate, they have to become attractive so they have to become men. Well the rest of his messages about that, but they have to do difficult things. Yeah. That's what they have to do. They have to, they have to deal shit, confidence, get your shit together. And martial arts I think is one of the best ways to do that. I've seen so many men that were like sick, insecure and Dorky and w they become fucking nerd assassins through martial arts. And it did. I think it's a great way to build confidence and I think there's an extreme lack of adversity, like physical adversity and a lot of people's lives.

Speaker 3:          02:38:55       And overcoming physical adversity is what leads to a lot of confidence in men. And I just think that there's a lot of men that are just have no idea whether they can or can't do anything difficult. And they have massive insecurity because of it. I think he would agree with every word. I think he went to everywhere that you just said there. Yeah. I just think that marriage is not fixing it. You know, culturally enforced monogamy's not going to fix it. They have to become men and women was to have a reason to want to have sex with you. Yeah. Yeah. So I think he would agree with that. I think he would say that once you accomplish that, that that's when you will find more women and that the next step, the next natural progression in life is that you will find someone that you want to be partnered with and that that then has the best value for our society.

Speaker 3:          02:39:38       But I don't want to completely state his case. Hmm. It's an interesting case, but he completely, I mean, look, why is it that for the little bit that these articles get right about him? It's that he's helping men. He is, yes. He's also helping women. But yes, he is helping men. Men need their shit together. They need framework for sure. I mean, people need this, this thing about discipline and you know, uh, you are, you, are you aware of, you know, you're aware of Jocko Jocko willink. Yeah. That discipline equals freedom. It's like one of the best catch phrases. It's so, it's empowering. It's so empowering. Get your shit together and then you, the time that have for

Speaker 5:          02:40:14       recreation, you'll appreciate it so much more. You don't appreciate rest when you're fucking off all day. You're appreciate rest. When you've worked hard, that's when it means something to you. When you've accomplished goals, that's when this celebration is, is something that you, you get a good feeling from it. Do you have a part in your life that you feel like is lacking in that department? In what department and just like getting your shit together, like not slacking on. I'm pretty good at that. Yeah. That's what I do. Yeah. I mean, I do a lot of shit. They're the only way I could ever do as many different things as I do is if I just get after it. Yeah. I get after it pretty fucking good. Yeah. And I'm not, I'm not an insecure in that. I mean, whether it's through martial arts or any kind of exercise or work, I just, I take pride in getting things done.

Speaker 5:          02:41:01       I take pride in working, you know, especially working towards things that are important to me, whether it's working on my set, working on my stand up, whether it's working on a podcast, whether it's working on my martial arts or my fitness or yoga or whatever. I get after it. Man, did you got to? Yeah, and for me, it's not a matter of whether or not it's an option. It's like brushing my teeth. I don't decide one day, oh, I don't want to brush my teeth today. I just fucking brush my teeth. And when there's days where I'm doing fasted cardio, when that alarm goes off, it's not a matter of whether or not a shut the alarm off. That's not an option. You Get up, you put your fucking shoes on, you get the dog and you go running because that's what you do. And if you just decide that's what you do, then you get things done and then a month later you're like, oh shit, we did this all month and then six months later it's like, oh I did this half a year.

Speaker 5:          02:41:57       And then if you're doing Jujitsu, you're like, oh shit, look I got a blue belt. Oh Shit. Now I'm a purple belt. And that's how you become a black belt. You just, you know, and I got my, the good type of progressive cause it gets progressively easier too. I told you I'm doing that. It doesn't though. It doesn't get easy. You don't think so? Cause it can hard every time that alarm goes off like fuck. But you for you now then, right when you started, I don't know man. You know the reward of it, you know that that reward is some enforcement. There's some enforcement in the success that I've had in, in completing these tasks, but every fucking time I go to yoga class, I'm like, oh Jesus, 90 minutes in 104 degree temperature with these all these women that are going to humiliate me.

Speaker 5:          02:42:38       They can definitely do things that you can't do. Well. This is their tough man. There's a lot of these older ladies that are fucking tough. Yeah. You know, they just gut it out. I was just one lady that goes there. She's like 60 years old. She doesn't even bring water and this lady's in there for 90 fucking minutes, sweat it out. She's there every time I go, I'm like, she's not bringing water. You sure? She's 60 she could be like 20 and just dehydrated. Oh, she's gray hair and tough as shit. She drinks water before and she drinks it after. But when she's in that class, he's just tough. It's just, you know, they're there. It's never easy to do. You know? It gets a little bit easier when you get better at it. But then you just try harder and it makes it more difficult.

Speaker 5:          02:43:15       If you're always giving a hundred percent effort, it's always going to be hard. You know, you, you take some pride in the fact that now I can go two miles through the hills and you know, and reach the point of exhaustion where before it was one or whatever, whatever your little little progress markers are, you get some satisfaction that, but it's always difficult to get going. The the, the hardest step is the first step is not the 30th step or the hundredth step. It's the fucking first one. It's getting on the trail, getting going. It's the hardest thing. The hardest weight to lift is the first one. Cause once you get going like okay, I'm a half hour into my workout, I'm writing things down. I'm supposed to be doing now I got, you know, 20 Chin ups, then burpees and then all these days you have to do it. You just have to do it. And so many people have a hard time doing it. If read in moving,

Speaker 2:          02:44:00       if you would have ever thought when you started standup that you'd be sort of like, cause you're kind of like a lifestyle guru in a in a way. You know what I mean? Like every time I've done the sensory deprivation stuff, ride the float stuff, every time I've gone into the place when I just talked to the girl, when she's like setting it up or something, I'll be like, oh Joe Rogan got me into this. And they're always like, oh Joe Rogan, he got everybody into this. Like you literally like created float places. All, I went to one in Nashville, like the woman was like, oh Joe Rogan. I love Joe Rogan, but like that and the mma stuff and all that. Like what a bizarre adventure. You know what I mean? Like you probably would have never thought

Speaker 5:          02:44:32       now that the only reason why it happened because I had no intention of doing it. It's like I didn't have to pull them zero and time, never written a book on lifestyle or just fucking what to do. I just say what I do and I do it by example. Like obviously I do all these things. I mean that Jim's not there for looks. Yeah, I fucking do all these things. So this is, I think this is, this is just a natural thing that's happened, but the float things, the most bizarre one because I can't believe I'm the one to tell everybody but this doesn't he man. But how the fuck doesn't everybody already know they do now. More people know now, but how the fuck didn't they know when I first got my tank in 2002 and um, I had been talking about it for a couple of years before because I had done one where, you know, you go to a place and you rent it for an hour.

Speaker 5:          02:45:18       That's how we regular people do it. I get it. You've got to get it. I need one man fucking need. When I tell you how often do you turn it? As much as I can. I mean it's right there. It's nice you're doing this more like once a week or oh, more than that for sure. And I like to come in here, you know, different, I'll come in here sometimes even after the comedy store, you know, coming near Weird Times. I'll come in here during the day. But the whole idea is that this is something that somehow or another was created in the 60s by John Lilly and nobody talked about it. It was like kind of a suit, Weirdo, popular thing with hippies for awhile and then it fucking went away. But they were barely around. And then I started talking about it and now they're everywhere all over the planet. And that is the strangest thing to me. It's one of the strangest things about my entire career is that the float tank business has sort of started up because of me. Yeah. And that they're everywhere in the world now. There's hundreds of them everywhere in every country and they didn't exist before. You know, and that somehow or another, you could directly connect them. A lot of them. To me that's very strange.

Speaker 2:          02:46:22       What does that say about ideas? I mean, what does that say about saying what you think and explaining what your life is to people? That's what they want. I mean, I think when I, when I'm with Jordan, the thing I realized more than anything else is he's giving them a little room to be who they are. He's taken some of the bullets, you know, the hit pieces and all that stuff that we've talked about. He takes a little bit of that to take these positions that are not wrong, but her just politically incorrect or somewhat intraocular are controversial. And by taking those positions, he gives other people just a little bit of a force field to think a little bit. So, so for you in this, it's like you started doing something that gave you a little peace of mind, a little something that made you feel good and feel healthy and clean and mentally sound and all that. And then you started talking about it and then holy shit, somebody in Nebraska was like, I'm going to try that. And the next thing you know, she opened a clinic for it and is doing it. You know what I mean? And then that that spurs and so if that's the beauty of saying what you think,

Speaker 5:          02:47:18       well it also works the same reason why this podcast works like this pot. I've never promoted this podcast. I just did it. And through word of mouth it got bigger and bigger. Yeah. The thing about float tanks is I'm telling you how amazing it is. You try it and it doesn't suck.

Speaker 2:          02:47:34       You know what I mean? It's not like if you don't enjoy that, I don't know. Yeah. It's not like all these people went and tried it out. Like he fucking lied to me. God dammit. No, they went to, oh my God, it's so relaxing. It's amazing. I got it.

Speaker 5:          02:47:45       Fresh perspective and my body feels loose and relaxed. This is crazy. It's like there's a real positive benefit. I'm telling the truth.

Speaker 2:          02:47:52       How quick can you snap into the zone that you want to get into and you're in there. Cause that's when I was just did it a couple of days ago. I've done it a couple times now and I've usually been, it takes me about 20 minutes to kind of clear the clutter. But you know, sometimes it's more, sometimes it's less. This last time just cause I think we've been traveling so much. I've been planes every day and everything else. It wasn't till the law. That's what it happens. Like the last five minutes I finally got to that place where I was kind of disconnected. But do you have a trick for that when you get in there?

Speaker 5:          02:48:19       I've done it so many times that my body knows what it's doing. Yeah. I lay in a tank and my body is like, oh here we go. Oh yeah, just sink in. But I've done it. I don't know how many times I've had a tank since 2002 so you're more tank tank, tank time, you know, and then I've been in there on mushrooms and weed and you know, we'd edibles especially that's the weird one. This marijuana edibles or the one on some of the most underrated psychedelics in terms of like introspective thinking, self examination. It's like, it's one of those things that just forces you to really go over every single aspect of your subconscious you're trying to hide from.

Speaker 2:          02:48:59       You got gotta. You got a good strain of Endeca that's not going to completely destroy me. Like my weed situation at this point and I used be a big pothead. My weed

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       thing is like end of the night puff for my vape pen, like watch the same simpsons episode that I loved in 1989 like that's good enough for me. Like I don't need, like I know a lot of my comic friends, like they want to smoke a sativa and write, write, write, and I'm like, I've opened up enough doors in my brain. If anything, I'd tightened a couple of hinges, you know what I mean? I don't need to go the other way again. Like for me it's much more about relaxation. Well there's a lot of great sativas or indicas rather. All you have to do is just go to any store and then just take a little hit and then we'll try it out. Just the whole thing is just don't go too deep. Like people try three, four or five hits and then never smoked pot before and then they were in a k hole in the corner crying and screaming.

Speaker 4:          02:49:47       And you know, it's like Jesus, what? Your body doesn't know. What the fuck to do with all that. Thc like this, watch this, watch this. I, that's it. You're good. Blow it out. Relax. Give it an hour. Find out what the fuck the effect is. Don't just keep hitting it. You know, I've seen people that don't smoke. Poggle I'll try and then an hour later I'm like, are you going to die? You think you're going to die? Like you, you look, you're freaked out man. Yeah. Um, so I back in the day, like college and a little bit after college, I did mushrooms, I don't know, maybe 20 times in my life, something, something around there. And then I haven't done it in about 15 years. And then about six months ago, so mushrooms appeared, it doesn't matter how they were in my house. And I was like, all right, here's what we're going to do.

Speaker 4:          02:50:32       My, my, uh, that's friends over and David was there and we were like, all right, we're all just going to take one cap. We're not going to like have a full fucking pussies. It's been a while, man. Come on. So I was like, you know, we're just going to take one cat. Okay. See what did I do? So we'll take a cap. And we had smoked a little and we had drank. It was after dinner and we were just all hanging out. It was a couple of us and we were like, all right, we're going to go play some video games. So we're playing, uh, like nba jam kind of thing, you know? And we're playing and plan, plan, plan. And I'm going, guys, guys, my controller's not working. My controller is not working. I can't control this. Nothing's, we're working. David looks at me, he's like, you're not holding a controller.

Speaker 4:          02:51:10       I was playing on my leg. I was actually, I had the controller on my life. Yeah. I had no control over. I was actually, I thought it would. So I'm telling you one cap, you mocked me, but one cap can do the trick. That's the story with a, you need to go to a doctor and find out what's wrong with your brain. One caption this. Hmm. Wow. Worlds for more interesting than I thought it was. Video Games. Rogan, playstation four I jumped connected. I have jumped right into like playstation four you know, video games are good when you're with a little bit. I would recommend once you get into the two or three caps, you put the fucking video games down. Just lay down and think about your life. Yeah, I but I for video games, like again, I just want to have enough time. So like I like old school, eight bit run one way.

Speaker 4:          02:51:55       I want to run Wah Wah. I want to run back. Yeah. I want that. I want to run that way. I don't even want to run backwards and I definitely don't want to run this way. I just want to run that way. So Mary Oh metroid that kind of thing. I tell you that new silly shit. Yeah. Like I want to blow some stuff up for a few minutes. I can, you know, I don't have to murder a family and rape people into steel crown or, I mean I, you know, I've raped a couple of prostitutes and you know all that. It's fun when you're doing it. Someone's going to take those fucking sound bytes. There we go. I see you subconsciously. You give it to him. You know, I just gave it to little people. Who are they? Who are, who are you? Are they? They all need a hug. Everybody needs a hug. I think do, I'm less combative with every year, less defiant and combative with every year with this stuff. I'm more shrugging than ever. I'm like, just try to be a nice person. Tried and tried to be nice. Try to be nice to each other.

Speaker 5:          02:52:47       Do you do your best at whatever you're doing, keep moving. And when things pop up and people write, things just go,

Speaker 4:          02:52:54       okay, well what am I gonna do you think that could be a connection though to eventually killing the drive to want to keep doing things, like to want to keep being funny, to want to keep getting out there? No. My drive is for the people that enjoy my work. My drop when I'm, when I'm doing standup,

Speaker 5:          02:53:08       my drive is because I know there's a bunch of people that are getting babysitters and they, they're there. They bought tickets in advance and then like next Friday, Joe's coming to town and I'm,

Speaker 5:          02:53:18       I'm working hard for that. I don't want them to have a bad experience. I want to do the best fucking show I can do. I'm dead serious about that. That's very important to me. I understand it's a massive responsibility and I'm doing the Chicago theater like I did last weekend. Two shows, 3,700 people show. That's a lot of fucking people. I don't want anybody to be disappointed. I want to do my best job the best I can do and that's where my drive is. My drive is to, I'm dissecting material, I'm rewriting it, I'm practicing. I'm going. I went up three times last night. I'll probably go up. I'm going up at least two times tonight. I'm doing the Improv and I'm doing the comedy store. I do that all the time, man. I do that all the time. And my drive is to, there's a great reward in making people laugh and there's a great reward in, in d we made an exchange, you know, uh, they came to see me, I made them laugh.

Speaker 5:          02:54:08       Everybody's happy. Look, we had a deal. That's the deal. And I've worked, it's not an easy deal. It's like you got to work hard to fill your end of the bargain. But if you do work hard and you do work at it and you do examine it, you do put in the hours on stage and you do go over the rewrites and listen to the recordings and do your best. It's rewarding. Yeah. The reward is that I, I, I, I can say that those people have a good time. Like when I put a video up on Instagram, a bunch of people cheering after the show, my feeling, what am I, this is like, we shared this time. You guys had a good time. I had a good time. I'm super happy.

Speaker 4:          02:54:45       There's nothing like thank you. Yeah. Cause I told you I'm, I'm just getting back in. So I just booked my last couple of hours. So on the nights off that I'm with Peterson. So we sold out the DCM prep. So that champion perhaps holdout Irvine Improv here or by an Improv. Yeah. Urban apro and yeah, I feel that now cause it's weird because you don't know me from comedy. So it's like

Speaker 2:          02:55:04       I did it. I lived all those New York City years as a comic, never hit into, I was a good comic, but I never hit into to TV in that way. And that's why I started doing all these other things that led me to this. But it's like they can put my name up and now it sells out. And I was, it wasn't before. Right. So now it's like, I feel this extra pressure of like, wow, these people, like they're really coming from me. It is extra pressure, but it's reward to it too. It's been awesome. I mean it's like I'm getting back to this thing that people don't know me from and it's like I'm good. I, I sent you, uh, the hour. I haven't sent it to anybody. I'm not putting up publicly, but I wanted you to see it because even if you could only watch a minute, because I wanted you to know that I'm a real comic, you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          02:55:44       Like, because otherwise it's like we can all sit here and be like, yeah, I'm kind of blah, blah, blah. Um, but it's, it's incredibly powerful. Like when you're in that room with those people and you make it real for that. And I know my style, like I'm never going to be the best joke writer on the planet. It's not where my passions lie, but I like being in that room with these people doing what we did here and, and getting everybody playing and being in the moment. And I get people kind of yelling at each other and screaming and announcing their political differences and like all this crazy shit. And I don't know anyone that's doing it the way that I'm doing it. And it's not like I'm doing a set the way Seinfeld with layout, you know, every word, you know, for the hour. Um, well not a, but I love it.

Speaker 2:          02:56:25       Again. It doesn't matter. The beautiful thing about comedy is any way you want it. You do it your way, your way. Dave, we just did three hours. Shit, man. Now I got Sam Harris. I've got to run home. I came here from the airport already. It's already three 20 that's crazy. I got Harris at four I got to get the hell Outta here. Well, thank you, man. It's always a pleasure. Wait, hold on. Now I'm getting you official. You went to Shapiro before me. This is what I listen to. Just it happened and it was free that day. We'll do your show. All right. I've so many other things to say to you. Gentleman, Dave Rubin backs brother.

Speaker 7:          02:56:57       Thank you. [inaudible].
