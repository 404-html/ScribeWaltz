Speaker 1:          00:00:00       When I'm driving around that corvette. The corvette doesn't have a radio. It's one of the best teams. Yeah. You know what and have them know radio when you drive around with no radio. D Two one live. When I was a young and I used to deliver newspapers, my car didn't have radio and I used to come up with some of my best shit like for like standup comedy material with no radio. Just drive it around doing other things cause I had a fold newspapers up and throw him out the window. And when you have no radio you have, you're forced to think. And when you force a thank you think about shit. When he forced to think about shit you got, it's like we're constantly distracted, man. We want to look at our phone all the time. When I see this podcast today, ladies and gentlemen, no laptop.

Speaker 1:          00:00:43       I'm trying the new thing. Jamie, Nice. No laptop. I'm trying. And then if I got Jamie here, if I need to Google some shit, boom here, I probably should have tweeted it's about to start here at Twitter right now. That might help. That might help, but there you are. Yeah. Here I am. Distracted, distracted. It's important man. I mean once it in the car, you spent so much time in the car and you listened to music and just to pass time. Exactly with you man. Well one thing that's good though is a podcast and books on tape. I do. I do really enjoy doing that. I so I, I think that like having the option is probably better, but the corvette doesn't have radio and I just, I liked not having a radio. I like sometimes just drive it around just being alone with the thoughts here in the rumble of the engine.

Speaker 1:          00:01:31       You know, if I had that engine, yes. Well your engine is pretty fucking sweet. Sound intense, dope. But it's not that corvette think sounds well it's a different kind of thing. But you wouldn't want to live with that everyday either. You'd get annoyed. Correct. Alright. You're fucking loud. It'd be like living with a crazy coked up stripper. It's just going to say that it's like dating stripper ban. It seems fun. Every now and then it gets real. But not just living with her, but like she would have to drive you to work and everyone sees you look at hey and she's got tattoos on her

Speaker 2:          00:02:03       Mac and cheese loud and she smells like calm. I was like, Oh, this is fun on Saturday. Yeah. Like listen lady, I'm almost 30 years old. I got to get my life in order. You got to get out of my fucking life. I'm at Starbucks, which I need you to play. That's what happens when you're, when you're young, like those things are okay, but as you get older you realize like, hmm, this is not fun. This is just, there's a lot happening. So I think it's fun when I'm drunk, you know? Well I think it's good for like once or twice a week and then the girl true. It depends what they were talking about. Cars for the group depends on the guy. We are talking about cars, we're talking about all things. You don't want to watch an action movie every fucking day. Hell No. You don't want to watch explosions and fucking missiles. [inaudible] you want to watch like stepbrothers, fun, mix it up, mix it up. And I love ice cream but I want every day. That's

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       right. Mixing it up is big and that's what people with everything, right? Everything man. We were talking about it off the air. People get too comfortable. They do never comfortable. You know, one of the things that would freak me out lately, not freaking me out, but it's been like, I've been like wha wondering on it. Like on my message board sometimes I'll have a guest and then I'll read like after the podcast that like for like, it's almost like half and half sometimes like Ha, I had this Guy Milo Yiannopoulos, you Annapolis, Annapolis, uh, on the other day, hilarious guys, gay guy. He's a blog or really funny blogger. Lives in England and he was over here from London and some people love the podcasts on people. Fucking hated it. Worst podcasts ever. This was shit. Oh my God, this was just hilarious. I love that guy. He's so entertaining.

Speaker 1:          00:03:48       I want to drown him in a toilet bowl. It's like you can't, that's what you want though. Yeah. You kind of, that's kind of what you want, that you want to, as long as they're talking about it, you're good. You cannot make every, it's not possible to make everyone happy. It does. The only person who ever made everyone happy was bill Cosby. He was the only guy. I'm not, I'm not choking. He was the only guy. You're right. He didn't, but he was the only guy that for a long time. You never heard God damn bad thing. Nah, those Jello commercials pissed me off that bullshit sweater all the time. Black blacking up. He was so good as a comic and so good as the host of a show and it's, the Cosby show was so well done that literally no one spoke ill of them and all the while he's drugging checks and ray brown dude, but he might be the only guy.

Speaker 1:          00:04:44       There's like a few like Anthony Hopkins, you know, there's a few actors, but no one knows him. You know what I'm saying? Niggas feel like we feel like we know bill Cosby or we thought we did. We thought we did. I feel like Jay Leno was one of those guys in what most people love Jay Leno. You don't hear a bad thing about it. Really? Oh, that's so not true. My way off on this. Yeah, you're so off. Yay. Let, first of all, I love David Letterman might hate him. Not just a Letterman, but there was a bunch of fans of Conan O'brian. There was a whole situation where Conan took over the tonight show and then remember Jay Leno had a show before him and then it became like this crazy thing where the tonight show wasn't doing so well. Well, yeah. This is like Cosby rape and bitches. Just before that, before that, before we knew that people still didn't like him, man.

Speaker 1:          00:05:29       Yeah. Yeah. There was certain, first of all, shops love Jay Leno, my household. What state was this again for Denver? Colorado sounds about right. We love, especially Lamprey, weed being legal debt, living on a farm with really good electricity that's being on a ranch somewhere. So people that, a satellite dish. But I think, um, uh, there was a lot of people from the Howard Stern group, like for standup comics, Jay Leno at one point in time, it was like one of the top comics in the country, real edgy, real edgy. When he was young, he would go on David Letterman, be like this, like super edgy guy. And then for some comics it felt like when he started hosting the tonight show, he kind of became more middle America and became more, but he did it. It's like it was a calculated move on his part. Smart move. Really.

Speaker 1:          00:06:20       It was a smart man. He's more, he's more corporate you're saying right. It kind of sold out. Oh, a hundred percent corporate Conard percent corporate, we say sold out. I don't know, because I think people who like what he's doing still think what he's doing is great. He just found a broader market that maybe might not appeal to like younger, more hardcore people the way a real sharp guy like Letterman or maybe Colin and Colin has some of the best writers in all of a late night. I love coding. Yeah. Especially like when he was on in the late night show in New York, he had like I had my buddy used to work for him, I got to see like one of their very first shows, you know how they have it, like we're having this banter back and forth because we're just talking to friends just shooting the shit when it would appear that they were doing that.

Speaker 1:          00:07:01       But behind them there was placards that have every word they were supposed to say. So their conversations were fake blood. Yeah. Yeah. They had a fake conversation so they'd be, so I went to the zoo yesterday. So someone's holding up zoo. Yup. Yup. Right behind him. They had, everything was rehearsed and everything was preplanned and eventually he got away from that. And I think in the beginning they were nervous because he was a writer and so he really didn't have a lot of performance experience cause he, cause he wrote for Senate live and Simpsons, right? Is that correct? I believe so. I don't know. But I know he was going to be super respected writer and a really funny guy. And the thought was that he was the guy that was like, it was always really funny in the room, like when he would meet with executives and writers, he was like the funny guy, really strong, intelligent, funny guy.

Speaker 1:          00:07:49       And they're like, this guy should be a host of a fucking show. And then they decided to, you know, build it up and make it work. But in the beginning they laid literally, it's probably micro management on the network side. They were probably just fucking with his show too much. They didn't just allow it. They're scared what it is. Yeah, sure. They're taking a big chance of having them there. So it was weird that there they're coming, I don't remember what my original point was, but their conversation, oh, this is what it was there. The conversation was written out though. So it was like the writers, what really sharp dudes that were trying to, and then they came out with all these different characters and reoccurring themes and everything that they would use on the show. And it became like a real cohesive thing. And then when he went to the tonight show, they change the show.

Speaker 1:          00:08:30       Like all of a sudden he was doing like the tonight show, you know, it's like the whole thing was different. The feel is different. You got to do what got you to the dance. Not only that, when they did at Jay Leno was number one, like when they had Jay Leno step out and they put Conan O'brian in, they, I think they probably, you know, they have these weird things where they base it on how old people are. Like if you're old as fuck, they don't want you because all people don't spend any money. They want those 1834

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       year old men who are single. That's, that's the, that's the real money. The real money is in young dudes who spend money on stupid shit and they probably easily influenced by commercials. So they didn't fucking shit. I know that, I see those KFC commercial, they fucking go. But there was also this thing where the Howard stern show was pissed at him and Howard stern was pissed at Jay Leno because someone, whoever it was on the Jay Leno writing staff most likely was ripping off ideas from the Howard stern show. Allegedly. I've never examined this, but I remember Howard being really pissed about it and he's not unreasonable when it comes to stuff like that. It doesn't make sense how it's a powerful dude too. Yeah. I think also like sometimes writers do shit like that, man, that's happened like a gang at times with standups. Writers will come to see you perform and then they turn your bits and like a part in a sitcom that happened to Kevin James.

Speaker 2:          00:09:51       I witnessed it. I saw the whole thing. It's happened to several guys and a bunch of different shows and well, you know what it is like say if you're a writer, you're a young kid from fucking Cleveland and you get a Gig writing for crystally his show, right? You got to be assigning a man. Yeah. You got some fucking demands and some of these guys will come to comedy clubs and they'll just pull a pill for idea. It's a bad idea, man. I mean just shitty at your job. It does. It does, but it also means you're trying to get by. Fake it till you make it pregnant job, but you can't fake it off other people's ideas though. I bet you're going to get caught up. I agree. I think a lot of them is no longevity and they think they're not going to get caught up.

Speaker 2:          00:10:31       True. They think they're just going to get away with it. Just do it now and then. I'm really good. They just don't know it unless Joe Rogan sees that shit or anybody now. You know when I, when we put out that youtube video of them and see a thing that was a long ass time ago. I just saw that like couple months ago. That shit was awkward. It's so awkward. What'd you get on stage like? Well, I was on stage before him. I know the stories coming up. Right. He actually wasn't supposed to be on. He took the microphone away from the guy who was next, the guy who was next to this guy, Kirk Fox. He just debotta like give me the mic because I brought him up as a writer because Kurt used to write for, for Carlos and I said there was a writer for Carlos men steal.

Speaker 2:          00:11:12       Yeah. And so, uh, that was it. That was it. It was a straw that broke the camel's back. But then you jump up there and then you, and then he kept saying, he goes, I have the mic. You don't realize dummies. I have the mic. And you like give me a fucking mic and you get the Mike shut that shit down once he's still alive. He's alive. Is he still alive? Did you have him kill? No, he's alive. The UFC mafia get to him. Is He, is he dead? He's out there doing standup still. Yeah. Yeah. I hope he's doing well. I hope he's doing well. Hope he's doing his own shit. You know, the problem with those guys are, one of the big problems is when you steal, you don't learn what it to come up with. Bit like, I've got a couple of bets right now that they're, they might die there.

Speaker 2:          00:11:57       I'm looking at them, they're like, they'll like bad dogs. Dogs are broken hips. I'm like this mother fucker down. So a horse sort of broken legs. See, I'm trying to think if I should fix the bit or if I was just tank it. That's the battle though, right? It's what makes you great. It's the, well, it's the only way to make a bit good. You gotta bring that motherfucker out to the light of day and you got to tweak it and roll it. And there's some times that bit's just, they just don't seem like they're gonna make it. And sometimes you gotta let them go, but that's why you're making a living as comedian. And then Carl has been seen as like, fuck man, we still making a living. He stopped was still probably does really well, you think? Yeah. Yeah. I mean he's a name, you know, he can go to weird spot and do comedy clubs and still probably do pretty good.

Speaker 2:          00:12:37       But the reality is, you know, when you, when you do that, when you steal, you usually steal because you're, there's different mindset for a plagiarist than there is for someone who's creative. And I think the mindset of someone who's a plagiarist is the mindset of it's all about me, so me getting this stuff and then I'm going to do it. I'm going to be a bad motherfucker. It's about me. Whereas I think the mindset of someone who's more creative is all about whatever the idea is and you're just sort of like on a train to get the idea to the people. What I think if you're creative too, you see an idea and you're like, well you, you viewed it from a different filter. Does that make sense? I can see the will, people can see an idea and view it from a different filter.

Speaker 2:          00:13:22       Like I think this is the funny way. Like this angle might be funny sometimes. Yeah, sometimes. I mean, it really depends entirely on the idea, but I think the big factor, one of the big factors is ego. And if you have a big ego, it can help you and it can fuck you. It can do both. It can help you in the gives you like the courage and the belief in yourself, even if it doesn't make any sense to try something that's very difficult to, it's huge, man. That's huge. At our first live show, the first eight, nine minutes was me by myself. How's that? Was the bit watts is sanded it off. Who told whose idea was this? Both of us. Why would you want to do that? It went awesome, man. You're talking about egos. Egos and went great man. Well People Love Dad came there to see you, man.

Speaker 2:          00:14:14       So he did stand up. Yeah, basically. Basically like told a story. Wow. Yeah. And had this whole bit and pieces you've done standup. Your first standup was in front of a live audience, right? It was a podcast. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. That's crazy. Your first stand up Everest on the Internet. Yeah. Whoa. That's not what we are. We're not releasing it though. Oh, you haven't released it. We're not going to. People want to release it last. I'll release my, my, my standup portion, but we want to make it special for the life fans. People hate that. Why would you want to do that? They're already there. It was very west special for them. They bought, probably want to hear it again and then a bunch of other people want to hear it too. But yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       So come to the other live shows. We're doing all these tours. No, you think we should release it like their accounts idea? We'll probably mind. Yeah. Um, I was thinking as to retard to be yours. This is my only thing. I honestly think it's special for these people live there live. It's already special for them. They probably want to hear it again. There's probably a lot of people that were there that said that was a really good time. I would love to share that again in my, on my commute. And then there's other people that weren't there, which you going to punish them because they couldn't get to break. That's what you're doing. That's what you doing, man. Recording released the house. Unless you're thinking about, oh, you should release it 100% full fuck. Do I have to do well, you should should. It's good.

Speaker 3:          00:15:48       If it's good, you should release it. It's great. Then you should definitely release it. Why not release it? Because we're doing a nationwide tour. Good. Keep doing it. Like you would bring more people to the, to the actual live. They're going to come anyway. Don't worry about it. Yes. God, what are you worried about? This 350 million people out there. You can't. You you need to do is clone yourselves and have more shows to do them in more spots. Well you don't need to worry about is people not showing up at a spot because they heard alive. Unless the live podcast sucks. If you come up with a dud, you do have that advantage, but if you come up with a dud, you could tank it. Like if for whatever reason just goes awful. Just bombed. Excuse. You know, if someone has to roofie you or something before the show, they could, you never know.

Speaker 3:          00:16:32       You just start talking. I'll tell you what, man, we did live questions and use. Usually we filter them. Some girl, you know, like I've never been on stage relates brightest. Fuck. They give them Mike, some girls shields. Shab uh, do you remember to me, do you remember me? I propose to you four years ago at the UFC expo and you said, yes, we're the fucks my ring. I was like, what the fuck? I'm trying to look like fuck. Is that moving on? Next question. Next question. Uh, Brandon, what do you think of? And it's some Ronda Rousey question. Next question. Oh, how much would Reebok next question. Oh yeah, it was fun to mix it up, man. I get that though. So you're involved a lot of controversial shit. Really tell him the truth. Oh, you're going to be real honest. Yeah. I mean, being honest.

Speaker 3:          00:17:16       Don't you think that's controversial? I guess it is for an athlete. I guess I'm supposed to be this fucking cookie cutter and get in line and it's just, I don't know what, you just have terrible PR skills and it turns out it works. It depends how you look at it. What is PR though? It's public relations. See, that's where they're wrong because your public relations skills are awesome because everybody knows you don't really have a very good filter. No filter. Your filter is like a bunch of string in front of a river trying to keep the salmon out. It's like you need a need more than that. They're going to get through that and they go over rocks. You got to have more than that, man. It's like a moment of pause where they get to this training and they go, ah, what am I doing here?

Speaker 3:          00:17:55       I'm going to do, someone asked me a question like, oh, fucking don't worry about it. You're a good guy. Yeah, sure. Try. If you're a good guy, just be yourself. If you're a good guy and you're telling the truth, I don't see why there, why you wouldn't just keep doing it. Like I was training the other day and this guy came up to me, he goes, man, dude, I love what you do. You know, you give me motivation to do some outside fighting, blah, blah, blah. He goes, but, but he goes, I wish I could talk about some stuff. You'll do it, man. Oh, oh, he wishes he could do the same kind of, but yeah, he just goes, I wish. He goes, I wish I just can't. Like some people, well, he might not be able to now and the road for him to get to the point where he can is long, but people that, people always think that they are who they used to be.

Speaker 3:          00:18:43       Does that make sense? It's like people look at themselves like say if you were a loser in high school and you fuck, there's a lot of people that are haunted by high school for like their whole life or certain events. Yeah. That's why for sure. But that's why being bullied and so dangerous to some people because if they get really fucked with by people and tormented by people in high school, that chicken carry over to wrestle live. It did, it devastates their confidence. So when the early developmental period they have it's really poor self image and having a poor self image is fucking super hard to get over. It was really hard. Well you know I've talked about before in this, I've basically body dysmorphia, which is fucking crazy man cause I'm in great shape. But it, and it happened in college. I had this girlfriend for a long time and I had this huge event.

Speaker 3:          00:19:27       Uh, I was getting ready to trap for all these NFL teams and I, uh, the night before I was going through all my mental stuff on how it was going to do and I put on exactly what I was going to wear. And it's the, you know, you don't know how to act and eat like a pro, but I did it for fuck four months and I was like feeling good. And I'm like, damn, do I look like an NFL guy right now? This is how an Nfl guy looks right and that my girlfriend, I go, what do you think? How do I look? And she goes, look a little soft. You look, it looks soft. You're the kind of Chubby. Wow. One girl got you. Got me. I was literally like, ever since then, man gave me a fucking with you when she, did she date some bodybuilders before you or something?

Speaker 3:          00:20:07       So dude's cut weight and eat. I think she was just trying to be honest. Maybe she didn't have a filter. I don't know. Make that pitch another pill. Could we see? Yes. You look down under the car. Did you immediately for calling? You saw shortly after that, very shortly. But you were like, why be the nerd? But ever since then I was like, damn. And then fuck that. Fucking my competence the next day. That can do that then yeah, if you let it, and I think it's like snake venom. Like you get a little bite. Gil will bite every now and then. I think it's good for you. Good, good. You got to understand what's happening when is insulted you, you got to understand, you know, and sometimes they're just being honest with you. True.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       And there's a time for that, but that was not the time for that. You had a fucking shows tryouts, big games. Big, big event. The next day based on my life up for at the time is a huge event and she's telling you soft, tough man has a mean bitch. Did you guys have fights before this? Was She mad about something else? Uh, I mean, I'm sure I was a shitty boyfriend. Did have another girlfriend at the time. Yeah, I did. Okay. We'll figure it out as a bad guy. Well, I'm not a bad guy. I'm in college. You're not going to get married. Yeah. Young, dumb and full of cum. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Right. That's why that expression exists. Yeah, man. When you say young and dumb and you never heard young, dumb and full of calm, no. Oh my God. That's a old really up Jamie has, that's all he's heard from me a hundred times before.

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       Rogue out. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, for sure. It's not mine. I was, I think it was around when I was in high school. But you got some old school shit. I think it's some old school shit, but it's new school too because I've heard it from people recently and someone would have told me that in college or high school. I'm like, damn, that's aggressive man. Super. That's it. But correct Jesus Christ. I know, right. It's like you're just trying to damn old air flow. Yeah. But when you say that nobody goes, I don't even understand. Everybody goes, yeah, I get it. Yeah. Hundred. Yeah, 100% that was me. I was thinking about myself in high school the other day for whatever reason. You know like sometimes you have this weird moment where you just think like, wow, what was it like to like to be like if I had to go and do that again, what was it really like?

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       What are my memories of it and what was it really like? Cause my memories of it were all like, oh, always nervous. Fucking never confident. Always weirded out. Yeah. Yeah. Trying to get away from everybody. Always just, I was weird here. That kid so weird. I was accepted cause I like, I fit in like the way I looked fit athlete. I didn't know anything about sports. I don't know. No sports and all I wanted to do was kickbox so I wanted to do, all I wanted to do was taekwondo and kickbox one tough back then it was a, I was so, I was such a Weirdo. It's all I did all day. I was upset. I was always insecure, everything but that, like when I did that I was super confident. Like I knew I was really good at that. So there was like one thing I couldn't wait to do and get the fuck away from people.

Speaker 1:          00:22:59       What about girls? I had a couple of girlfriends. I did all right. I was good looking guy. It wasn't, it wasn't that hard of just, I wasn't like, I wasn't very good socially. Not for sure it wasn't good at it. I was like, it wasn't really good at that until I calmed down. Like I don't think I was even that good socially when I started doing stand up. I think I got way better at it cause I realized I need to, but I was, I was like one of the things that I was thinking when I first started doing it was like, man, I wish that, I wish I would just go back to competing because in competing I didn't need anybody's approval. I, I kinda liked it if he didn't like me, I kind of liked it. If there's a bunch of people cheering against me, I was like, just wait, wait to see what I do.

Speaker 1:          00:23:40       They're like, wait a minute. Yeah, it doesn't matter to me. It just going to give me some more motivation. It's going to give some more intensity. But with comedy everybody has to like you and then you realize like you're not that likable. Like just kidding. Yeah. But like sometimes like things we do, like things a person does, you do to be successful, but you're not thinking in terms of like being liked. Like I always wondered about like guys who are extreme extreme winters, guys like Lance Armstrong or guys like Michael Jordan and they get reputations of being not very good guys are very nice guys or maybe greedy. Like you always hear that about Jordan. He doesn't selfie selfish. Selfish. Yeah man. Then you got to think like a guy like that is so focused on this one thing. He's so focused on winning. You're so focused on just beating everyone down and it's all about him and him getting ahead.

Speaker 1:          00:24:33       You're so focused on that so you're not thinking about how other people are perceiving you cause you're like, fuck them, I'm coming in a dunk on their face. Yeah man. That's, well that's what greatness requires. That that's what I learned through my journey of athletics. The best players I've ever played with. They weren't the friendliest, oh the the the best fighters who I trained with or best fighters that I ran with. God, not the friendliest man. Georges St Pierre. Saint Pierre's is super fucking friendly guy. He's like George George. George is super friendly, super friendly. I wouldn't say George is the most out. There's a, there's always something, George might be the exception. George is, uh, a very cerebral fighter. I went say George isn't the most outgoing guy, you know what I'm saying? Like George is kind of an introverted soul was picked on as a kid and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          00:25:19       He, he's different. A lot of the, the super winners, they're just different men and it's something, maybe they are born with that or they some event in their life happen or something like that and they're just these ultra winters. And I could never relate to it. I gotta be honest. I wonder if being like that that's the only way you become an ultra winter. If you just think about the winning only, you can't be this like really social butterfly person that just goes around and makes friends with everybody. You gotta be some driven psycho that's getting up at four 30 and running up hills. Yeah, man. And then you mix that with talent and how yeah. Fucking the greatness. That's where the greatness comes from, man. Yeah. You know, I had a crazy conversation with Bj Penn the other night. Um, I just got texts out of the blue from Bj called Bj up and a beanie.

Speaker 1:          00:26:04       Bj and I were talking about all sorts of shit and he was talking to this friend of his, who got his black belt for years. You know, Bj got his black belt in three and a half years, which was crazy. Crazy. So the guy, you know, and Bj talking to in Bj goes, wow, that's amazing. Congratulations. You must be really talented. And he goes, no. He goes, I'm, I was, I'm addicted. He goes, I'm addicted to Jujitsu just like you, you were addicted to. And Bj Sat. But he goes, I never thought about it that way. And then he goes, I realize, yeah, I was addicted. I mean, that's why I got my black belt in three and a half years. I was addicted and we were laughing. He was talking about how he's addicted. So he like final fantasy. You're playing game. I have

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       one in like eighth grade. He plays that shit. He got no one point though. He got addicted to that game. That's just, again, that's how these, that's how these crazy successful people are. The, there is no one foot in, one foot out. It's fucking all in men and nothing else matters. Nothing else matters. Yeah. That might be my problem. Joe. You're too nice. Um, but on occasionally, like I wash our cro cop fight the other day. You weren't very nice. No fight. That was not nice. You know, you were super aggressive in that fight. I was, you know, it's weird, man. It's like I watched the, uh, the, the Alexander in DC fight where it's back and forth and I used to get inspired by those. Right. I used to, I used to watch a great fight and as soon as they ended, I hit the ground running.

Speaker 3:          00:27:33       Well, I love to run. I would just run. That's how I dealt with being nervous and what's next for me. I just start fucking running now. When I see that stuff, I think first about their health, I'm like, damn, what? I hope he's okay. Yeah. And I felt that change in me and I'm like, that's, well that's not good. Yeah, that's not good. That's not good. Don't get me wrong. I still appreciate it. Great. Fine. I fucking love fighting. I don't miss a fight. I view it different now instead of thinking that was amazing fight. I think, man, I hope they're okay. Hopefully they're not too injured and what's next after this? Even if you win the belt. All right man, what's after this? Cause I, I've, I have friends who have one belt and you know, they're not fucking killing it these days. It seems like it's one of those things where you just have to, you have to be able to put aside any thoughts of the damage that you're doing to yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:28:25       You've got to be able to just do it. And now as soon as you start taking into consideration that damage and it becomes, that extra factor becomes that extra thing that you have to think about, you know, that that can fuck with. And also that thing that can fuck with greatness like we were talking about, about greatness is like this obsession plus talent, dedication and drive. But then you add the variable of fear of injury or concern or playing conservative to avoid injury. I agree. I think, um, I was obsessed with fighting and I think if you ask anyone who, who trained with me or, um, one of my coaches, man, hardest work in the room, Shab by far I was crazy. Crazy. But then when it came time to fight, you ever seen the old school robo cop? When he's about to attacks on, it's like calculating and it's like fucking 70% of gun here. That's how my fucking mind works, man. I don't know what to do. You know what I'm saying? Like, uh, my last fight, I'm sitting there and I'm like, I know here you can close this. I know he's going to kick in too much. Um, and yeah, I'm thinking too, I'm too, so rebel. I'm thinking way too much. While they're probably not like that, they're going, they're in the zone. They're in the zone there. They're fighters. They're going, yeah, it's tough, man.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       Well, it's one of the most difficult things I think for, for people to do is get in that zone to figure out that that place that you get to where you're just relying on all of your training and you're just their instincts. That happened to me once, once Gabriel, Gonzaga. Really only once. Only once. I don't know why. Could not tell you why. Well, I think I remember that fight. Just everything was slow motion. I didn't hear the crowd. Everything you through I already saw coming and it was just like, it was just like this white noise. That's a one time I've been in the zone. Never gotten the zone and football really. Maybe once, but fighting, it's a, it's a fricking to get there, man is unreal. Well, it's different. It's like if you get in the zone with a plain pink pawn, the loss of getting in the zone, it's, it's not dangerous to your health.

Speaker 1:          00:30:34       Yeah. I, the thing about fighting that makes it different than anything else, even more difficult than Jujitsu cause Jujitsu's nerve wracking and when to watch two guys going at it and they're trying to kill each other. They're nervous as fuck before that, you know, but they're not as worried about injury. It's a different kind of injury. Cause the Jujitsu injury you might get choked, you might get your arm snapped. It is possibly get hurt me. You could always embarrassed, right or you could land wrong. Fuck your knee up or fuck your neck up. But it does happen. It is possible. But MMA or kickboxing, anything along those lines. Moitai yeah, I watched this Moy Tai knock out the other day. Oh my God, it was fucking insane. Some guy from Thailand, I wish I knew who it was cause it was an animated Gif that someone's sent me and this dude hits this guy with the, he's got them in a Thai clinch.

Speaker 1:          00:31:21       He hits his guys with this fucking ridiculous knees to the body like three Riddick boom, boom, boom. And they go into the ropes and then dude hits him with a flying knee that is just the most perfectly time flying knee snaps his head back. His body goes limp and he just slides against the ropes and down to the ground, but it was just the poetry of it and the explosiveness of it that just boom, boom, boom and he flies through the air, Bang, hits him in the flying knee, like the fact that that could happen to you and you get in there with a guy who's training how they mean you just like hoping he doesn't know how to do that. Yeah, well especially this day and age, you know I was watching the last UFC, I was watching the last UFC and that that, what's this?

Speaker 1:          00:32:07       I forget his first name. The Rodriguez Feller. I air GI here and the Northcott. Northcott. I watch. Yeah, year Rodriguez and I'm like, what the fuck? Well you know what the difference is? The fuck is going on taekwondo, taekwondo, those guys have all the other shit to Northcote this small. I did some research on this kid. Oh Yeah, the smallest dad has him fucking do all this crazy stuff. I'm like, that's the future, man. It's neck. And then I watched two, uh, you know, I'm, I going to say her name. I'll watch two other guys who, you know, we're kind of the same class. They're a

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       little older than me. I watched him fight after watching Rodriguez in north gut and then watching them fight. I'm like, I'm watching. I go, that's how I fight, man. That's what it looked like. Like you fucking went all throwback Thursday in the middle of the card. You know what I'm saying? Like these guys are just boxing, wrestling, and then you see these young guys and it's like, fuck man. Yeah. Yeah. Did you see that? Uh, what is his name? Macramed off the Russian dude that fought Sean Jordan. Yes. God Damn, that guy can throw some fucking kicks. You see that front leg question Mark Hickey was hitting him with yes, but it's more of a taekwondo point scoring. Like no one's going to be scared of those kicks. Cool. Great. Even his punches, all the slapping you, he's moving, he's moving. He's going to be in trouble when he gets in there with a killer.

Speaker 2:          00:33:28       Maybe not that Jordan's not a killer, but a guy who can deal with that maybe and hits for heavyweight. I was almost a little bit of a a point score where it's so much footwork and I'd touch and move, touch and move. When you get a heavyweight and he's gonna. Okay, touch, touch, judge whacked. Right. It's like a heavyweight is when he get in trouble being a lighter heavyweight maybe. What is he to 40 he's not lying. He was two 36 I think. [inaudible] that'd be a lighter, heavier anything on I considered lighter canes to 40 and he carries a roll of fat on them. Now would you say Keynes, a knockout artist? I wouldn't. I wouldn't say he's a knockout artist, but you wouldn't want to get hit by him. But came guy who stands outside and point points, moods get puts, gets under hook, puts his head in your chest and makes you do it.

Speaker 2:          00:34:10       Does work completely different fighter mag man seems to fight like more strategically. Avoid damage first and then land shots and don't drain your gas tank. I agree. Which is smart at heavyweight. So he's a certain point because then you can get a guy who's not going to play that game. Well we'll see. We'll see what happens to him as he moves up. You know and we'll see. What am impressed with is his technique though. I agree. His counter punching was nasty. He liked that question. Mark kick does not have a lot of power behind it. That's a fact. But the fact that he throws it like that off of his front leg, like for folks who don't know how hard that is to do, that's, that requires like some crazy dexterity. And to see that from a heavyweight, it's pretty rare for the listeners. Most people will know Donald Cerrone for Donald throws him a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:34:56       He throws buffer a heavyweight too. It's pretty crazy. Yeah. And Well Donald doesn't throw it that much off his front leg though. Donald Can, he can certainly count. He'll use the bag. But that guy was throwing it like, like a whip office front, like it was coming up. And then swap, but just there wasn't much behind it. That'd be my, the, his footwork. Everything is cardio's great counter punching dope everything. But you're going to heavyweight where they're going to make it count. Sean Jordan. It's tough as fuck man. You know, he broke his rib in that first round. Yeah, he's went back to his corn. So all those broken, you never saw it from his effort. You know, he never laid back and they were put his arm over it. Ever tried to protect it. He uh, he had to gut it out while that guy was staying on the outside land and combinations.

Speaker 2:          00:35:39       Yeah, that main main event saved that card for sure. That main event was amazing. Those guys like sage Northcutt though. And here's another one. Wonderboy Thompson. Wonderboy is the motherfucker right now. He's a motherfucker because everybody, like in the beginning it was about taking him down and grappling with them. But now that he's been spending so much time with Weidman and he's learning how to grapple learning, grappling, defense correctly, you're going to see more of what you saw in the Ellenberger fight. Guys that are forced to stand up with the true and joy that you have a good time. We can we finding a snake, can we call them wonder man though? He's 34 couldn't five like what the fuck is there any way we can use that wonder man? He can keep it. Yeah. He keeps wheel kicking people in the head. He can keep it as the only thing coming up.

Speaker 2:          00:36:24       I don't know. I think you're always fighting. He got surgery. I know. Get from person a to bring him in was named Mark Cart and Denver. Nate met him through I think a church thing, whatever, how that goes. So brought him down and he's just this bad ass in the gym but had zero grappling. But standing with them was a fucking nightmare. And then Nate told George about them and then we see Thomson up north and he starts getting his grappling in. And then when he got to the UFC, I think he was doing well with matchups and then he got Matt Brown, right? Yeah. That's when he got in trouble. Yeah. Matt Brown beat him up. And he also, uh, was overtrained for that fight. He said, uh, he came in that fight real flat and he knew it was in trouble even before Matt Brown. He's like not taking anything away from Matt Brown.

Speaker 2:          00:37:05       He goes, I just could not recover. But yeah, he survived though. He made it to the third round. He's a beast man that came down to watch for sure. Now he's so nasty. I agree. But what those guys can do that guys like him guys, I got a year and code. We're a sage Northcutt rather sage Northcutt has that front leg kick that he throws and he is very unusual because he throws, he stands orthodox and throws his front leg side kick off his left leg and it's a really good front leg side kick. So you, so you've seen his previous fights, was he seven to oh seven to nine other previous sites for getting the UC? I haven't seen anything besides, I've seen a few of his fights. Okay. I've been watching him for awhile. I've been hearing about him for a while too. Um, but what he's, what he's got is a, uh, an unusual, he's got a very high level of like karate and kickboxing and talk window, very high level of taekwondo skill, but then also ridiculous athleticism.

Speaker 2:          00:37:59       Like he does front flips here. That's what I see out of it. Doesn't most Flint front flips and lands on the tips of his toes and like gently comes down to his heel. It's not like a clumsy bounce. It's like this effortless flip where he knows exactly where the ground is stocked as Instagram. I saw him doing some crazy shit like caring wheels and shit up sand hills. He's a free look at this. We have this flip. I mean it looks like it's like some moon landing shit that looks fake. It looks like a model too. He looks like what the fuck is going on Paige vanzant if she was a boy, those two need to procreate. No they don't.

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       They'll be like some Uber race. Look at how he does that. Doesn't use your mill. That literally looks like someone's got wires attached to it saying, I'll give you, showed this to Eddie Bravo and put some chem trails behind it. He would be absolutely, dude, he's going off for an hour for Northcott and half the class right now. I put, ah, dude, you don't use a student at Texas a and m o was talking about dropping out to do fighting full time now man. Nah, no way. Whoa, whoa. Because it pussy. Yeah. Texting him. Johnny Manziel who used to run that page. Now it's you. Mr Northcutt. He's, I don't think he needs any help. I think it's probably better if he takes breaks. Nest a break every now and then. You know, I think he's Uber religious. I don't think he cares about that. That's not good.

Speaker 3:          00:39:17       That'll build up. Kid needs an outlet. Yeah. Those flips won't be happening like that after a while. Well, a body like that needs to fuck. He got a little bit, I kick to be extra just like those quads. 100% don't sleep on that Dick. Don't cut. His wrestling is good too though. I mean, he's not like, he's not like the best in the world at anything but all together. It's a nasty pack. He's good at everything and his athleticism is going, came so far and he's only 19 he's going to be so much better in a month. You know? It's a little scary being 19 and being in the UFC already is there. Yeah, you can be champion with it, but let's say he loses three in a row. Well that's not what's, what's scary to me is that he is overmatched quickly. But that's what I'm saying.

Speaker 3:          00:40:00       We don't know. We don't know if that even can. Michael McDonald, Michael McDonald, 19 years old fought Miguel Torres. Dude Mcdonald before he lost he rife favor and before he lost a Hennen, Barao was a motherfucker. Motherfucker. Motherfucker. Motherfucker. Isn't that a perfect, it's a perfect example. He cares, but you can't do it. This kid can do like with flips and stuff, but Michael McDonald knocks motherfuckers into oblivion punches. Where's Michael McDonald right now? When's the last time he's heard from [inaudible]? He's been injured for how long? Two years. I think he got hurt pretty bad. I don't know what the injury was. I don't even know if he's, he was up close as it fucker for awhile. I'm just saying the only thing that scares me is like if, if we, uh, reference boxing. So a 19 year olds going to have how many amateur fights? Fucking 300 before they get to turn pro.

Speaker 3:          00:40:47       Right? This is bay. We're seeing Northcott's career amateur career right now with only seven fights. What the fuck? Seven fights. Ain't shit. Well that's, let's say when it's three and he's a star. Hey my man. Or You went to more your star. There's, hey bro, there's nowhere to go. We have to toss you to these monsters. There's no buildups for three years. Trust me. You would know. That's an interesting point. That's what's, that's what's tough about this sport. Like a page, right? She's phenomenal. She looks great. Speaks great chess skills. Cool man. Let's build this up. She can be your one 15 pound champ, but she's won what? Two or three now? All right. Well in that women's Davinci. So thin we're going to throw you some mother fuckers. Well how about the motherfucker? She's ranked seventh at the top of the list

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       is a goddamn murderer straightening yarder yawn is a murderer. She's a murderer. I mean she's the best striker. Definitely top cup five best strikers in the UFC. I'd say she Merck's chicks, she Merck's him. She, she does some horrible shit to them. Straight up. Yeah. And so I think like when you look at her, all right, before she gets into MMA, she's a six time world Moy Thai champion. That's her amateur background. What she had to learn was just take down defense, defend yourself on the ground and figure out how to get back up to your feet. That's what cro cop had to learn in pride. Yup. You know, and I think when you deal with someone like, like Gennady Golovkin perfect example, he's had like a fuck load of amateur boxing fights. Sane man, saint amount. You turn pro at like late twenties and then he goes in the pros and these guys just can't fucking compete with him cause he's ready.

Speaker 1:          00:42:24       He's so ready. He says such another level. His, his technique is so sharp and on top of that he's gets just this stupid punching power that everybody's terrified. Now would we see triple g, the guy, the superstar, the is now if at 19 we said, all right, you gotta go pro, boom, get it. It's a good question. It's tough right in. But the thing it's, it's no one's fault. That's the empathy of the UFC. It's just where we're at. But for someone like Paige and Northcott, like with, with Northcott, if I sat down, I'm like, dude, they offer you a top 10 guy. No Man, you're good. I'm telling you bro. I called, I called out fucking Brock Lesnar after I beat fucking Gabriel Gonzaga. You know what I'm saying? It's like, dude, what I wish so and been like, Yo, shop chill man. This, this isn't, this isn't a fucking sprint hair.

Speaker 1:          00:43:11       We will got to jog on my man. The boxing systems like super established. Know that's what I'm saying. It's no one's fault. So long, no one's fault. But everybody knows how to do it. Like they know, like when a guy gets to a certain level, like you know Terrence Crawford or something like that, like you give the guy some tests along the way, but you realize early on, okay, you're dealing with a really talented guy. This is what we're going to do. We're going to slowly build them up with some tougher and tougher fighters and we're going to see where he's at and we're gonna sit down. Like that's why trade trainers like Freddie Roach are so invaluable because they sit down, they watch as these guys are fighting the, Oh we got to get him with a guy with a body puncher and we need to see what happens.

Speaker 1:          00:43:45       She gets pressured. We're going to give him a test in this fight. And what you're trying to do is trying to build your fighter up. Whereas what happens in MMA, there's no like longterm structure and there's no amateur structure that's like comparable to what boxing has. So it's really hard for people to get built up to the point where they come into the pro ranks with a very high degree of skill. Unless they come from a different disap Breslin. I see wrestlers, Damien Maia, Damien Maia, fucking smashing people. I mean Tammy Meyers Jujitsu is terrifying. But what, what was, he was a multiple time world Jujitsu champion. Shot Gray Jacques Perrey same thing. Yolana same thing. Murderer, Moy Thai champion, six time world. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       I mean across the board there's so many examples. Johnny Hendricks, elite wrestler, Tyron Woodley, elite wrestler. I mean you can go down the list came Alaska Daniel Cormier, wrestlers. Yeah. You look at all the champs, Ronda Rousey, judo Olympic. Yup. Look at all the chances they have this extent of amateur back and now you get these other guys who don't have that background. It's such a disadvantage. No one's fault. No, I'm not pointing any fingers at all. I'm saying it's an issue in the sport where it's tough man. Because I was talking with, so, uh, I think it was Kenny Florian. I'm like, man, I'd love to see Northcott get like eight fights in the UFC, Merck people and get comfortable. And we both agreed that there's, there's, that's not gonna happen. Cause he goes, he wins for neuro. People are crying for a tau shot and a reason for this is because of these freaks, these one percenters that everyone compares everyone too.

Speaker 3:          00:45:21       And that's like a Rhonda Rousey just comes on the scene. Merck and people are John Jones. You're talking about most people aren't like that man. Those are the Lebron James of our sport there most people in the sport at the championship level or not like Jen's what I'm saying or run, but they're just not there. They don't have that mental game. You know what I'm saying? And then again at the extensive competition background, before you ever get to MMA, I think you become like a champion already. Like there's only a few guys like Gustafson's a good example. Gustafson was a good boxer. You know he was an amateur boxer I believe before he got into MMA. Correct. But how much experience did we haven't boxing? Did he? How much? How many amateur fights of, yeah, I don't think it's extensive. I don't think, you know, he was like, oh, but he's obviously like a hair off the champion, you know a hair off the Jon Jones fight here off the Cormier fight.

Speaker 3:          00:46:12       He wins that fifth round with Cormier and he's a world champion and I agree and it's heartbreaking. It's soup that, that, that fight was super heartbreaking for me. That fight was crazy for dustbin cause it's like he lost a John and I, this is loses the DC. He's just, he's that guy man. Did you see the picture he posted on his Instagram today and I saw you between this almost made me tear up. I know man. Me Too. You know I love that guy. Yeah, he's a great guy. But I love DC to DC too. And that was a great fight. But now you've got a motherfucker waiting. Yup. John, John and I don't know if you've seen his Instagram, but this motherfucker's motivated and lift. He was whooping, everyone's asked three weeks of training. What now you're going to take coke, Keno away from this motherfucker and drugs and make them lift weights and I was going to do a real camp.

Speaker 3:          00:46:59       What the fuck do you think's going to happen? It's going to have a hard time cutting weight. Nah, it's figure it out. We'll figure it out. What it was that he looked big, didn't he? Jack looks like he's getting ready for prison. Jack, Jack, Jack Man. He's the best. He's the best. As far as a light heavyweights. Go for sure. I mean it's not close though, Joe. You know what I'm saying? Like I love DC, I fucking love DC. He hit that guy. I love working with them. I love being around them. He is greatness at its finest. And you know I have a son on the way. DC is a god can point to and say be like DC. He's a good example. He's a great dude. He's done it the right way. You can't say that about John, right? Well right now you can't.

Speaker 3:          00:47:42       But Johnson, she's a young guy. He's 27 years old, right? Not that young. But the thing is is with, uh, with DC, he's like, he's like, he's like the Phil Mickelson. You what I'm saying? He's like Phil Mickelson of golf where it's Tom Nicholson. If tiger woods isn't exactly, if tiger woods in the round, we're all fucking wearing fill mix and shoes and shit right now. Really? Yeah man. But Tiger Woods is that motherfucker. He was that 1% better and just beat them every time. Socks to be Phil. I know, man suck. He's still making bank. He's still making bank and people love them. But it's a difference between the UFC and golf. You're not making that Jon Jones my place. You can still have a private jet. You should take down number two's doing mind Ronda. It ain't fun. You Ain't sipping champagne with Dana white on private jet and number two, we're Nike Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:48:35       The disparity between number one and number two financially is fucking enormous and fighting. Yeah. Fuck yeah. It's fucking enormous. It's like there's no other place where it's bigger, you know? Uh, yeah, I mean box and you could say that a little bit. Well not really. Cause you'll get to knowing who I think is the biggest threat to John. I just hear this rumble. Oh I disagree. I think rumble. If rumble gets his conditioning together and I think rumble had a real hard time in that Cormier fight. Um, but the, the rumble that you see when you saw him fight Jimi Manoa, the rumble that like you're smiling. Why are you smiling? I'm smiling because you're like, man, if if rumble fucking got his cardio together Bro and fucking got taller and longer, his not on them. I'm not saying that you're asking for and say that, well, can't help Gustafson when he fought gossips and he took us to send out in the first round.

Speaker 3:          00:49:30       True with a headbutt. But the thing is, oh no, I love, don't get me wrong. We definitely did clash heads, but I think his head got hit too. Exactly. What happens if John Fights rumble? What happens? John takes him down. Where's his us out and break some of the second round? Probably so midsummer Tkos wow. That's how good John is man. And everyone's like, oh, shops at Jon Jones. Not hugger. Nah Man, he's very good. I don't know what to tell you. It's better than very good. Very good. It's not even a good description. That description. I agree. He's, he's by far the best. Like there we have everyone and then we have John. That's how fucking good this guy is. That's how bad he's beaten. People would have John and the kind of technique that mighty mouse has. Fuck kind of took me on footwork. We're going to ask you like a rumble match.

Speaker 3:          00:50:12       Like what if to have this time off, John Jones comes out and he starts fighting like Tj Dillashaw. I'm like God, why? Oh okay. What do you think about this Tj Dillashaw thing? Tj Dillashaw moved camps to elevation team elevation in Colorado and you know Uriah is a note. Well understandably upset. You know, I knew this far weeks cause he moved to my head coach, my old head coach. Oh really? Yeah. I can't say anything. I don't want to break the news. I'm not fucking surreal. Hawaii, someone's coming with cash. Is that what it is? Yeah, muscle farm. Jim is his pain. The UFC fighters now. Ooh. And so yeah, Tj is grown there and I tell you what it does. Do you ready for this one? It sets up your a t j Taco bout our fucking countdown. What Reebok kits for everybody. What you imagine that?

Speaker 3:          00:51:03       Do you think they would do that 100% they were agreed they would fight each other now even more. Wow. Yeah. They've said previously they would be down for it. So what is the muscle farm deals at? Some dude with oil money or something. I don't know what those muscle phones, a diamond factory style or no, well I think what they're going to do is cause they can't really be in the UFC anymore, so they came up with this plan. We're like, all right, we'll sponsor fighters. So we'll get all their Instagram and social media and we can put our brand on them that way. Oh really? Yeah. Because since where all came, right, like that's pretty smart. It's smart. It's actually pretty smart. I don't know how much to pay them if it's smart, but what makes smart to get their social media? Because I always thought about this because let's say you give me whatever, 10 grand to wear a tee shirt for one night for 30 seconds or you can swap it for the year and all my fucking social media training, I'm rocking your shit.

Speaker 3:          00:51:49       You can get way more coverage, man. Well you can today too, especially with a guy like Tj is super popular or someone like Rhonda or you know anyone who's like very popular on social media. You'll be social media savvy though. A lot of guys aren't all, you've got to have someone that works with you and for you like a manager or something like that and knows how to do that shit. I used to hire a photographer, Eric Williams, beast photographer, and he come to my train camps. He would take all these pictures and send to me at night so I could post them throughout the week. You would post them on yourself? Yeah. Yeah. Some people post all their shit theirselves and some people, like some athletes and even some, uh, like musicians you see like posts posted by team cruise. Tom Cruise has like a team that posts, it's kind of lame though in its very lame.

Speaker 3:          00:52:33       Like I think it's dope that social media allows people access to that they normally wouldn't have. Yeah, that's what I talked about, the personal interaction, like whatever. Not Saying Dick Pics. We know what I'm saying. That's what it's supposed to be all about. It's supposed to be all about like, like if you get a tweet from me, unless it's a, if you read a tweet from me, unless it's from a youtube video, like the youtube videos, when they get uploaded, they automatically generate a tweet. Yeah. But that's just the title of the Youtube Video. There's no opinion in that or anything like that. If you get opinions or, Hey, this movie was fucking awesome. I ate at this place. It tasted great. I chill. That's amazing. 100% I don't want to let anybody else do that. My manager one time, I forget which fight it was like, oh, I'll tweet live free during your fight. Like get the fuck outta imagine. What do you kind of phrasing? Oh Shit. He was saying, no, hell no, no. What I was doing a show, they wanted to take my social media, uh, safe. I wanted to

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       take over my social media. You're bat shit crazy. I never do that. I was like, you gotta be, you gotta be on drugs. I didn't let my girl fucking see me. What? I'm not giving the Cineo Hall was a, at the Ice House one night and I was talking to him. It was after a show, you know, he did the Arsenio Hall reboot and uh, after they did it for a while, it didn't work. Yeah. It didn't work out or whatever. He's having fun. He doesn't give a shit. But he was like, I can't get my fucking Facebook back. He's like, they have my Facebook. And I go, well, you can't get it back. He's so glad to give it to them when a, I had to give control of my social media fucked up. Yeah. You got to do that. Well, Kevin Hart was talking about this, how movies now.

Speaker 1:          00:54:05       Uh, tell him like, hey man, we need you to tweet out or Instagram the movie. He's like, that's on the contract. If you want that, you gotta write, then that's extra money, man. This is, this is a completely different machine. W Well I'm, I'm doing the movie. You're pay me for my talent. If you want me to promote on salt, my social media that I've built myself over the years. You don't have to break this into the contract. That's interesting because I would think that if he did something that he enjoyed, he would want people to see it so he would, so I get it 100% I get it 100% I do. But I also think like at his level, he must be making so much fucking money that like to say I want more money to use my social media presence, like what the social media presence is really just going to do is alert his fans to some movie that he's watching his movie.

Speaker 1:          00:54:50       Good. Sometimes you gotta be careful of social media and this is just me, right? To compare it to Kevin Hart. Tom Notch. Shit, I'm a grain of sand. But when a company comes in, he goes, whatever, we don't work with the fighter and the kid. I'm like, cool, well the deals with me and Brian and like, yeah, but we want your social media to have me post this stuff. Listen man, Fans Smith, they hate that shit a motherfucker, man. They will always want to figure out some way to weasel in always some way. I always gotta be a way to get in you. You know what? A lot of things, a lot of people are experiencing this, they're getting courted by these networks. Like there'll be a network, like a podcast network will come to them and want to take a piece of the action and get in return.

Speaker 1:          00:55:32       They would provide them with a certain amount of commercials. Like really? They're not providing anything. But what they're doing is they're saying by saying, you know, hey, we'll provide you with some commercials. We'll give you some commercial revenue. But by saying that, what they're really doing is they're trying to figure out a way where they can make money off of what you're doing. Where you're doing it completely independently. Like right now what you're doing is you're taking your stuff and you're just putting it online. Now you got to figure out that somehow, some way someone that's eventually going to figure out how to advertise that. So what they're doing is they're seeing like, this guy is missing out on some money. What I'm gonna do is I'm going to move in here and I'm going to take some of his, I'm going to give him some money, but I'm going to take some of his money where it doesn't make any sense that I would make that money. They're, they're like, they're giving away 50% in some of these cases with adjoining podcast networks, the networks asking

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       for 50% and the people have done this. It's like, what are you thinking, man? It's crazy. Don't give anyone 50% if you had a radio show that makes sense, like say if you were on a, you know, CBS radio, whatever, just to, just for a name to use, right? And you had some sports radio show and they said, listen, we're going to syndicate your show. Uh, we're going to bring your shell across the country and well, this is what we want. We're going to get advertisers and we're going to give you 50% of the ad revenue, but you're gonna make a lot of money. You'd be like, well, okay, that sounds pretty good. It sounds like a good deal, but the really they don't, there's no channels that people like automatically go to. What people do is they get, they download podcasts that they like, whether it's radio lab or the fighter and the kid or the Church of what's happening now.

Speaker 2:          00:57:08       They go to what they like and then they get it. Like the idea that you're just going to tune into a dial 6:40 AM it's the ghost, you know what I mean? Ghost morning show, you know what I mean? Like this, that that is like you have a distinct location that people are accustomed to going to, they're going to go there. It's like if you want ad space on Santa Monica Boulevard, well you know Santa Monica Boulevard is a well traveled area. If you put up a billboard up there, it kind of makes sense. You have to pay a lot of money. But if someone says, dude, I got this billboard, it's the middle of fucking desert. I want a lot of money, I a fuck load of money. I want to half of what you may, 50% is billboard up. Can other people get to that billboard? Yes. They just have to get in their car and they have to drive out to the desert.

Speaker 2:          00:57:49       And now about the money, me and Calvin had a serious discussion because you know, with, uh, with the Shibori link yet, no glory. Huh? We're trying to find it. I supposed to going with the podcast to better we, you know, we're getting more sponsors, advertise and stuff like that and we had a major like corporate sponsor come to us now. I fancy myself when I was younger, a couple of these products, especially with cheese and ketchup only, right? I loved a man. I don't promote it now, but I could buy a lot of with it, you know what I'm saying? But Kevin was like, absolutely not, man. He's like, I would never tell people to buy this stuff. You can't tell people to buy that. You can't. It's because it's the talking to Callen and I ran some stuff by you. It's just like, you can't do that man, unless you love it.

Speaker 2:          00:58:37       Like if in and out burger came to me and they wanted to offer a sponsorship, I might have to fucking say yes. I'll tell you right now is the chick fil a comes to me. What chick filet to hate gay people. Do you know that? Hey Man, I'm striking a chicken sandwich sandwich, bro. Listen, they hate gay people. Do they? Yeah. Jamie's like, not anymore. Not Anymore. Our push. It only worked on Jamie. Jamie's you one like not anymore. He interrupts apart. Not Anymore. Don't even know that. That's why. That's why. Damn. So I can't eat chick flay anymore. That's crazy. That's why those Goddamn promos with work. That's why those, they got me and Jamie says, I'll fucking take a chicken sandwich right now. Oh, they're very rude about the gay. They spend money to try

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       to stop her marriage. Yes. Been a big thing. You've ruined my good job. It doesn't matter. You can still eat. It doesn't matter in the long run. I like gay people because you have stupid opinions. Doesn't mean you shouldn't be allowed to make money. The problem is when they use no stupid opinions seat there was super religious and that's one of the things that religious people, they don't freak out about some things that are in the Bible. I like you very rarely see religious people protesting against tattoos, but in the Bible it's very clearly says don't get tattoos. We're both fucked. We're both fuck all superfoods. Hilarious is there's a lot of people that are super religious that fucking tattoo religious shit on their body that's not supposed to do that. Like there's other stuff you're not supposed to. Like if you go old testament, you're not supposed to be eating pork.

Speaker 1:          01:00:07       You know you're not supposed to be like an animal. A split hooves that chews its own cud. Like there's like we have rules like what you're supposed to eat and what you're not allowed to eat and there's a lot of people that break those rules. There's a bunch of rules about divorce and his rules of out property and it's like this is the rules that people break in the Bible all the time, but for whatever reason with really religious folks, that gay rule is the rule that they want and forced. I think they give a fuck. That's weird. It's weird. Like my good friend Joe Rogan said, maybe they're worried that Dick's tastes delicious, they're fighting off the gay for sure that some of the gay fighting it off like a vampire or putting garlic around her neck and shit. It's also, I think they, they, they think of gay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:49       This is, this is my amateur psychologist opinion love to hear and I think some people think of gay as being decadent and indulgent and that this will lead to Slava only behavior and too much partying and fucking and guys suck sucking each other off and come at each other. And this is not conducive to a good well-oiled society like Well Oiled Society needs people to be buttoned down and conservative. That's why conservative people, they tend to dress with like suits and ties. They tend to let you know, like, look, we're going to follow, I'm, I'm down with this agenda. Okay. God, guns, country. Um, uh, I listen to country music. I got a second amendment. They like, there's, there's so cookie cutter in the way they think that it's somewhere along the line, like, God, there's so many people that think along the same way.

Speaker 1:          01:01:38       What is it? Well, this is an adoption of an ideology. They're adopting a way to think they're adopting this hardworking American blue collar or you know, uh, conservative, uh, religious God bless America. Put your hands over your heart. Let's all join in and in prayer. God bless America. Don't you think they're doing that so they don't have to think for themselves? There's a little of that. Yeah, there's a little of that. And there's also, you're subscribing to this ideology that would most likely what you believe it's, it will most likely prevent people from acting crazy and doing stupid shit because they're going to follow God's rules. So it'd be easier to raise kids. Like it'd be easier

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       to have a family and just bring them to church on Sunday. And you say hello to the Wilsons and everybody talks fake. You're all talking like your strip club Djs. Hello Mr. Wilson. Look, Hey, you got a nice new sundown there, Mr. Wilson. Jimmy, come on down. Ah, listen man. People are looking at it all wrong. I mean the more gay dudes, the better more chicks for me, man. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. Well, I think there's that and there's also like this shit that I don't like. I don't like discrimination. I don't like it. I like any discrimination. It drives me nuts. I agree 100% but in both ways though too. Like I saw today, there was a Seattle Yoga place that will not accept white men or white people or white men. I tweeted it earlier today. Yeah, there's some Seattle. It is.

Speaker 2:          01:03:06       Fuck, do you hate money? I'll, I'll pull it up in a yoga class. Like damn, there's a lot of black people in there. Well, it's not that common and I don't think, but some people, some of the, some of the black folks enjoy the yoga. Hey mine. I'm saying in general, if you want to make money for sure don't kick out white people. That's their point. I think they wanted something that's there is, but to say that like that's, you know, to say that white people can't come. Like you got it Tammy, you're missing the boat, you know, it just doesn't seem to make any sense. So when fucked you on your business plan, well no whites allowed. It's whites. Yeah. It's only the one we want people of color. They want to exclude Caucasians in Seattle. Yes. Kurt Cobain. Lynn, you fuck it up man.

Speaker 2:          01:03:48       Yeah, like white people. Todd's tough. Well, you know, some people think that supporting black people is not racist. That just supporting university, supporting black people's not racist because black people have been oppressed and that we, we are doing is you're giving them place where they can join in a community and feel like they belong because they feel ostracized from the rest of the world. Especially in Seattle where everybody's white problem with that kind of thinking is, it's still the same thing I was saying. White people can't come in. It's like still the same thing saying like black people can't come in that's racist towards white people. It's just racist. Just make your fucking yoga place. Just super and guidance to blacks. Make it awesome, make it awesome to everybody and you know, and, and if you want more black people to do it because you identify with those black people, reach out to them.

Speaker 2:          01:04:37       But to say that white people can't come to your yoga class, that seems crazy. Why would you not like people based on how much melanin they carry it in their skin or their ethnic origin of their grandparents? It is fucking stupid. It's fucking stupid. So stupid. If you're white, stupid. If you're black, it's stupid. It's stupid. You're ignorant. Yeah. So what religions Chick-Filet Christian fucking a, yeah, it is heartbreaking. Yeah. Fuck you. Check. There's a bunch of Chick-Filet stuff online. Like there's people that were boycotting them and shit. That's crazy, man. You know how to, I had a cousin who was, uh, basically beat to death because he was gay. Whoa. Yeah, man. So it's touched for me so

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       no more Chick-Filet for me even though I love that fucking chicken sandwich. Yeah, see that's fucking crazy. That's not because he's on a bus and he was very like flamboyant. They jumped him and basically beat him to a pulp and he went home and died later. Um, crazy. Right? Jeez. Sahmri man didn't mean to fuck up. The flow of the podcast trees was crow timer. Denver Denver has on a public transportation bus. Yeah. A bunch of dudes jumped him for them to find out who it was. Yeah, they did catch up. Wow. What happened to them? I'm not sure. I remember I was in college at the time. My Dad telling me, I was like, what a fucking, and I remember like when I was younger, me and my brother are pretty close to him. Him and his brother Nathan and, and then then we know you do shit and just fall out of touch by her.

Speaker 3:          01:06:10       And my dad told me, I'm like, what the fuck? I remember being mad that I couldn't help them. It's weird, right? The idea that someone would want to just hit someone because they're flamboyant because it, yeah, I know what the fuck is wrong with the way they were raised. So 100% what it is. It's the way they were raised. It's 100% if you were raised in a community that didn't give a shit, that would be like no big deal. Like if if, okay, let's, let's just say us, like all of us in this room, like you, me and Jamie. If we had our own little community and one of us had a kid and then other ones, another one of us had a kid and we found out Jamie's kid is gay. Do you think you would want your kid to beat up Jamie's kid?

Speaker 3:          01:06:50       He like, would you, would you say you've got to kick their ass? Would you promote that kind of thinking of it never wet. No Way. It would never happen. It wouldn't be possible. But when you get enough fucking idiots in a city and you get enough really narrow minded, bigoted people that have these shitty ideas about other people's sexual orientations or the way they choose to wear their clothes, or whether they choose to be goth or whether it's anything, whatever it is, if it doesn't, it doesn't affect you. Is it poisoning your pool and they killing yours, your vegetables and your garden, like what's going on with your upset and you're, you're raising people to have this fear of it. And then they're interacting with other people at school and they all have this fear of it and they all want to let everybody know that they're not like that.

Speaker 3:          01:07:31       And one of the best ways to let people know that you're not like that is to attack. People are like that crazy man. Think about, uh, uh, we had a transgender person, I'm on our show, uh, Caitlin back and she was saying, Kristin Beck, Kristin Beck did save my men, Kristen Beck. And she was saying she'd locked down the road and just group of five guys came from behind his beat the shit out of her. She said it happens all the time. Transgender, it happens all, it's the number one concern walking down the road, getting beat up and she was a navy seal. He was a navy seal and gets her ass. What? That's a crazy situation. I had to be a navy seal, full beard, bad ass American killer out there, I think. I think it proves that they're

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       wired like that. You know what I'm saying? Like no one chooses like, oh, I want to take all this on and it's especially today's society. What y'all want to take us? I want to be gay and have people criticize him and all this shit. Some people are certainly wired that way. I think some are, yes, and I think some choose, but I think a lot people are born that way. And you know what? Here's the other thing though. The people that do choose, that's their choice. I agree. Fun Man. They're allowed to have that choice. Yeah. It's like if you want to be Debbie now, it's cool. You know what? Whoever the fuck you want to be. I don't give a shit. Again, same thing if it doesn't affect me, if it doesn't affect me, I don't really care. I agree 100% the people that do care though, they're scary.

Speaker 1:          01:08:52       They're scary to those folks. To folks. Someone that's transgender or someone that's flamboyant or or black. You're in the wrong place. You're black or white. If you're in the wrong place, you're white. There's people that will beat the fuck out of you because they feel like you got a fucking easy hand cause you were raised white. This will just crazy, man. There's bad people in almost every single demographic. You're going to find people that for whatever reason, they got to where you are in a fucked up way. Curve Ball, not to change subjects, but you think fucking humans are mother fucker watched national geographic for a little bit. Oh yeah. Mother Nature is a motherfucker. Yeah, till another level, man. Oh yeah. Dude, is this live? We got it. It's done now so we can see the whole thing's done. The entire event or getting ready to start it back up at eight o'clock Pacific Time.

Speaker 1:          01:09:43       But we've worked Kelly West coast, you can go back and watch this. Let's watch it now so we can start it whenever you want. Bring it. Bring it. So, so, uh, Joe Schilling already fought. The whole thing was done. Wow, that's crazy. It's only, it's not even eight o'clock. Yeah, it's like a four hour event. But Denver, it's in Denver. That's weird. They're only an hour. Okay, well let's, uh, let's see it because the main card though, right? Or do you wanna watch you do whatever the fuck we want. Now we've got power. Jamie, Doug, um, glory kickboxing. This is, uh, this is this podcast going to morph into a fight king penguin. Cause, uh, my good friend Joe Schilling is fighting on that card and, uh, he's in the main event against Jason Wellness, who's a bad motherfucker from Holland. Uh, two really, really good kick boxers and both world championship level.

Speaker 1:          01:10:31       Joe Schilling, of course. Uh, he's, he's been world champion has been, he beat our Levin. Who's a current glory world champion. He won that fucking crazy four man tournament. Crazy arts and 11 man. Those guys, they had to fight it. Was it three times or four times in a day? Three times, right? Three times that horrible kickboxing fights. Just he had some rough, oh yeah, man. The first one with a Simon Marcus where it went to the fourth round, they had a, they have three rounds. They were a draw. So they went to a fourth round and Schilling knocked him out in the fourth round was fucking crazy. Ah, that was round one. Two. Can we get some volume, Jamie? I don't think, Gloria, what do you want me to start

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       it? This is one of the early ones is just the whole four hour event. I got to figure out where. Oh, right. Does Christ. That's a lot of key. Let's get a, let's get this, uh, this screen over here and give us the data of who is that? Do that with this? I can't, I'm using the computer for the video. Oh, that's right. You're going to eight and 12 cause. Okay. Kevin [inaudible] strand a lot of Denver boys on this card. Being in Denver, this is a tough place to fight. Denver can be tricky when you're a, well not like Mexico City. Mexico City is the trickiest of tricky. That's why it's going to be interesting to see the Cain Velasquez we're doing reading jail. Yeah. Are they going to do it in Brazil? I don't think that that's confirmed exactly from pretty sure it's confirmed I fee.

Speaker 2:          01:12:02       I feel like you would know better than me. Well, I don't think it is honestly like it is. I talked to Javier Melendez how long ago? Javier Mendez the other day. Okay. It's a couple of days ago, man. I thought it was an, I hear Mauro run Nelo. I liked his commentary on these two events. He's great. He's gotten so good from doing showtime boxing during the Floyd Mayweather fights. He's really, really, he's excellent. I love the showtime crew. This feller with the tattoo on his back with us in Denver at grudge. J Ho. I liked that tattoo. That's dope. It's American as fuck. Sawn super. Got a Goddamn John American flag.

Speaker 2:          01:12:41       Uh, you were talking about nature being a motherfucker watching the, the, uh, oh my God, I have to turn it off, man. I don't do well seeing the animals die shit. Horrible Shit Man. I saw this mountain coat can chase by a snow leopard. Snow Leopard chase him all the way down the cliff. Grabbed him by the ass about the anus first. W key got away instead of dealing with death in the fucking snow leopard full just jumped in the river, died. Commit suicide, Babe. Baby dare just born in this fucking wild pack of dogs is coming. The mom pieces out. This baby deer can barely stand eight done. It's intense. Nature does not fuck around. More than half of all the Moose and deer that, uh, get killed. And Canada, uh, they get killed right after they're born by bears. Dude, I was depressed as fuck coyotes, shit like that right after they're born.

Speaker 2:          01:13:36       You know, that's a big thing too about grain. You know, a lot of people think that they want to live a life where they're not involved in any death. And, uh, that's, that's a noble, you know, you don't want to cause any animal suffering. I get it. I totally understand that idea. Even though I hunt and even though I eat meat, I totally get why they feel like that. But there's a reality to commercial grain and one of the realities commercial grain is, you know, those, those things that combines those things that they turned up there, they cut the wheat with those things are indiscriminate. They kill everything that's on the crusher rabbits and they kill a lot of fawns too because Fonz, when they're young, when they're newborn, what they like to do is stay put. So if there's anything common with they do is they just stay put and they kind of hide and they get ground up by the combined.

Speaker 2:          01:14:22       It's, it's super common. Rabbits, Rodin's ground nesting birds, all of them get ground up and those things, there's almost no way, unless you're growing your own food and you growing your own vegetables and you're there for the whole process, you make your own compost. There's almost no way to leave. No footprint. How about that Lq shot. You just posted it today with the deal. That thing. I shot it with it. Wednesday morning. 5,000 pounds. A thousand pounds. Enormous. A big animal. A giant animal. I'll show you another picture that's even more crazy of it. What'd you hit? Shoot him with a bazooka. Bone Arrow. Straight Bodell yeah. Yeah man. A lot of work went into that. A lot of skill of the bone now. Yeah. The SPEC for shoot Arrow bar. Well it's uh, it's coming from a guy who was the different shirts that you get a look at.

Speaker 2:          01:15:10       Huge hanging off of a, uh, a tree. We're cleaning it. You kind of get a sense of how big it really is. That's how he got into a truck to huge. Yeah. He's probably a thousand pound animal. It's a norm and they get bigger. There's some, some of the like 12, even 1400 pounds, a really enormous ones, especially at [inaudible] ranch. And by the way, they're not even the biggest moose are even bigger than them. Moose, her giant dude. There's Moose in the Yukon that are 1800 pounds. Dude. That thing is fucking huge. Imagine something twice as big as that. That's a moose in the Yukon, literally twice as big. Then what do you guys hang it then? You and your friend? Well first you, you back the truck to it and then they'd put it into the back of a pickup truck and then we, um, took it to a cooler, like a walk in cooler and then you, then the real work begins. You start, it's when you get your hands on ordering it and taking pieces off of it. And you brought it home. I brought most of it home. Uh, some of it is at a butcher shop and it's getting a turn into sausages and shit. And when you shoot some elk sausage, sausage, high protein son might wake up in the middle of the night with Predator dreams though.

Speaker 2:          01:16:19       When you shoot a thing like that, how long did it take for it to die? That was pretty instant. There was a, it was a perfect scenario. It was dead within a minute. But you know, that's one of the things about the discipline of, uh, of getting better at getting better at dealing with the nerves, getting better at aiming, making sure your archery skills are on point or your rifle skills for that matter. Like rifle, you could injure an animal rifle hunting too. Super, super important that you work really hard on it. It's also just so fucking nerve wracking, really. God, this is my thing though, with that fucking giant elk. If let's say you nick it, you miss or whatever and you it had your way. It's your ass. Really? Yeah. You're fucked. And if it decides to, Oh yeah, I'll slap the shit. Oh you.

Speaker 2:          01:17:03       Thank you. Well, does she the antlers? I did see the antlers. Dude. It's a tree. It's Kinda trail behind a tree, bro. I don't get it. All right, so Tom, if you could go behind a tree, you could pull it off, but keep going around the table. If you got stuck in an open area and some, for some reason he got to you first and getting fucked up, you're getting fucked up. It happens. It's not that common because they usually scared of people. They try to get the fuck away from you. What really happens is more with bears, with bears, it could really happen for sure. And Moose right, aren't Mussa gross of a shit. Well, they're definitely aggressive if you want. If you wound them Rinella, Steve. No, my friend from that show meat eater, he got run over by a fucking moose on a show dude.

Speaker 2:          01:17:44       It was crazy. Did he told me about it after the fact that I watched on TV, like the way he described it, it sounded crazy. But then watching it you're like, oh my God, he shot the Moose, the Moose went down, he thought the Moose was dead, came up on it and then the Moose got up and he went, oh shit, he's alive. And he went to shoot him again and the gun misfired which is so rare. It's so rare that you pull the trigger and nothing happened. So he had a re re chamber another round and in the process who is moose comes behind him and sends him flying and there was blood on him and he couldn't figure it out. If it's his blood or the moose is blood. He's like, he's feeling his body. See if he's been punctured. And we got nailed by a big ass animal. And for the Moose one for the Moose. The Moose get away. No, of course. No, no, no, no. My Buddy Ryan was there. Ryan Callahan put a bullet into him. What happened? We lose our, our feed. Yeah, let's move ahead. Anyway. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:18:44       But um, so, you know, just nature being dangerous. Nature, being a ruthless. We're a, we're so, I'm so insulated from it. That's why people have these beautiful ideas of what a, what animals aren't. How people fit into the food chain. We're so used to getting our dirty work done for us. This is true. You got to bring me some time, man. Oh, I got you. You want to come? I'm sending Everlast out. Everlast uh, he totally unrelated. They didn't even know that I got back from, from a hunting and he, uh, sent me a text saying that he wants to hunt and he wants, he wants to, you know, find someone that'll take him through it. And so, uh, I set him up with this guy, Brian Meadows who, uh, was, uh, my, uh, guide this past weekend or one of my guides. And He, um, one of the guys that works there, there's like a bunch of like really good guides that work at this one ranch and uh, he's going to, uh, do like a thing with him where he takes him out, shows him how to shoot, shows them how to you in the rifle and then they're gonna go hunt pigs.

Speaker 2:          01:19:47       How long is this parable? Days? Yeah. Well you don't like pigs. Some, a little more danger. You know what I'm saying? You ever see a wild boar before? Dude, they have wild boars on this ranch, Texas tusks, no tone ranch. It's up north, north of here, like an hour and a half. Not far at all. They have some photos. I'll show you some after the show received bills while the war's not fun. Wild boar sound like monsters. We were, we were there the first time I was ever there. Uh, we were passing by this really thick, these thick, uh, grasses like high tall grasses but weeds and grasses. Like it was like four or five feet tall. He couldn't see inside of it, but you knew there were pigs in there. And so we're walking down this dirt road really slow and quiet so they don't, they don't even know were there and we hear them fighting like what? It sounds like there's demons in there tearing each other apart. They fighting for some reason why they're making all these crazy bore noises. I was freaked out, dude. I was definitely freaked out by wild boars. Did you see that movie or that TV show? Game of Thrones? Yeah, the fucking king got killed by a wild boar. Giant boy until he got them. I've seen like one damn, uh, to just got dropped another demo. We don't even know who's fighting, who's the guy in the orange. Trump's, that's the Denver kid can understand them. Train. This is over.

Speaker 2:          01:21:10       Yeah. Dammit. My kids. Good little hairy armpits though, Huh? Yeah. Yes. Those up, man. Let's hold. Cool. I like that. Was his Bush look like? Probably ridiculous. See that Dick. So you see that? You see that doctor in the ring? They just show him with glasses. Check this story out. There's bang. There's bang though. That doctor on the left. Check this out. Oh, so he was in trouble right now? No, not at all. Okay. Horrible story though. Jamie. Do we have any more of these things? We have regular coffee, don't we? Didn't you make regular though? Are you still in my system? Coffee? No. No butter. No bullshit. Yeah. So that doctor, right? He goes on a family vacation wife, three kids. She bit life, three kids and fucking Subaru, outback, whatever the hell it was. They go, he's in Wyoming. They go, don't drive.

Speaker 2:          01:21:58       There's a flash flood warning. He goes off. Fuck it. We can get through. It drives flash. Flood warning through this thing. Takes the car over. Entire family dies separate home. Oh my God. Three kids. Three little kids and the wife. Oh my God. I'm just full of fucking who brought don't news first. The good news bear. Hey Man, I didn't know they were going to show the fucking guy. Oh, Jesus. You didn't have to tell the whole story. It's intense, right? That's pretty intense. So then, uh, Shane car, when a bunch of us did, or like a fundraiser form, ugh. Horrible men. Natures are cruel, cruel bitch. Nature does not give a fuck. We found an elk, the cop murked by another elk. Dammit. Elton crime. That's rare, right? Nope. We're all super common. They fight to the death. Sometimes they stab each other with their giant antlers. That's what the amateurs are for. But occasionally, you know, sometimes they just get scarred up and to get you have cuts on their head button shit on TV. Maybe rams. Cause they, they tangle antlers like deer and elk and Moose. They tangle antlers. That's the angle antlers are for, I'm trying to suck on those

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       antlers. So that eight, oh, was it IGF one or some shit people were doing. You want the velvet? Yeah. I want to suck on that velvet. The velvet deer, velvet and elk velvet. Uh, it was like a real hot property or one year ago. It was such a hot property that what they were doing was it

Speaker 1:          01:23:21       to see via the, um, the, uh, there were farms in Alberta where they were growing this shit. They were growing elk just to use their velvet. And then the process, for whatever reason, it became less and less valuable to people and the, uh, amount that's that Stevia is super weak, just pour a bunch and they're like, it's sugar. I was like the worst Stevia. Jamie got it from the dollar store. Dammit Jamie. But um, um, so this guy spent like a million dollars investing in this elk farm thinking he's just going to cash and on his deer of else spreading shit. Yeah. From the elk and uh, eh, nobody gives a five idea while he thought it was going to be

Speaker 3:          01:24:07       gangbuster business, but the business dropped. Is this the same guy that opened up a fucking all black yoga studio in Seattle? Oh, those poor fox. They're going to get attacked and attacked online to them. They showed this fool's record set three and five. That's a weird thing. Like where

Speaker 1:          01:24:28       that's bang on Bang, Bang, Bang on bang. But he's that guy that um, this guy tough to man the guy's three and five are they said he's tough. The Guy Bang Bang on bang is the guy that um, what is his name? Who did he fight? He fought somebody recently on a really good fight. I'm trying to remember, but he fought Raymond Daniels and Raymond Daniels hit him with that spinning flying ThreeSixty side kick to the face of it. Yeah, he jumped with the front leg side kick like flying side kick and then he touches you with that and spins and clipped him right on the Chin and send them to la La land on banks. Tough as fuck man. The other guy I think is from La, I think he's a, uh, he might be from the yard I think. Oh Shit. Nice knee. How much of these boys make? Not that much money, man. Did. Why? I'm sure shilling makes good money. She'll be making good money in the light being the headliner. So anyone know or no, I don't know what guessing. I'm just guessing. You know what I just root for for glory. I love kickboxing. I've always loved kickboxing. I love, I love Moitai to let's I root for lion fight too.

Speaker 3:          01:25:40       I almost what? I almost watched every line fight every glory. Uh, I watch every one of these. Me Too, man. I don't miss much. Especially the lion fight. I like lion fight cause they use elbows. I like lion fight a lot of time. There's a lot of uh, new guys on there and they'd go for fucking broke man. They seem to get a lot of like high level Thai guys to correct and they fly him in against like an American and show no one. You seen the wad wildfire.

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       Jesus Christ, he's national. We've said it before that tiff time bomb man a little. She's a very good teacher. Some takedown defense. You got one on one 15. She's very enjoy that lady's reverse Joanna, she talked some shit about joining a stand up. She said she was basic. Ooh, basic bitch. They say go, we got to get me trying to start something. Oh, what do you have in diet coke? Bitch basic bitch, bitch. Stupid basic bitch. What'd you got up? Fucking blueberry muffin with your coffee, your basic bitch. It's her. Anything worse to got a basic bitch. If you're a girl, ruthless man, it's well being called anything, you know, but something happened. Someone to find you. But having someone like limited defining you like that define unit. You're limited. It's hard.

Speaker 2:          01:26:54       It's hard out there. Still worse. Yeah man. It's worth it to have your coffee. Basic pitch book for a girl though. Does a girl have to be more than basic or she could. She'd be basic in hot. That's tough. Well see the hot factory? Well yeah man. It's like that's, that's nature right there. That is man nature. One hate on it. And h likes that hip to waist ratio. We do. Nature's a big fan of Teddy's. They're universally accepted. It's not like there's a place in the world where you have perfect set of tests and people go, Ugh, get those out of here. There's not a single country where men don't look at juicy tits and go, oh yeah, check. Totally useless to sit on it. They don't do anything for you. They don't increase pleasure unless you're fucking, unless your titty fucking, but you see them and your brain goes, oh yeah, it's nature.

Speaker 2:          01:27:45       There's bags of fat, bags of fat with nipples that you can suck on and they gently put in if they have weight to them and the girls riding you and you could like hoist them up and suck on them. Like, oh, everything gets so exciting. Why does, and they do nothing. They did nothing. Nature Nature wants you to have a wife and that's some big old titties so that when your kids need breast milk, this, these titties or down to produce big ass titties, dudes that need big hips and fat and asses and legs that looked like they can run and jump. So you have kids that inherit those traits? Yeah, man. If you see a girl with like weird hips and her ass is flat, she walks with a stumble. You're like, oh no, no, no. Immediate basic bitch. I call it the it beat it with your flat feet.

Speaker 2:          01:28:32       Flat feet, flat ass. Why can't you walk straight flat outside? There's nothing worse than a flat ass. Yeah. I don't mind if a girl, a small breasts now we'll figure it out. A lot of really hot girls that have small breasts money. We'll figure that out. Well, it's funny you don't, man, if he gets serious enough, I'll cover this. What'd you though? Would you want to or would you write a hundred person shop sponsor. You take that over, uh, over what? What would you take though if you had the option between a girl with a really nice acid, nice legs and small natural breasts or a girl is pretty dejected ass. Pretty decent legs, but big fake titties ass all day because I can fix the titties because they haven't, they haven't. What if she didn't want to fix the titties? What if that's a deal breaker going to have to move on?

Speaker 2:          01:29:18       Wow. I'm just kidding. I'm not kidding. I just said if you've seen my girl, she's from planet Pluto. But the thing that's so fucked up, but the thing is they haven't figured out a good way to make asks implants like you see a fake ass worst thing you've ever seen. There's a difference, man. There's a difference. The the ass thing, it's like there's an, there's like various factors, right? The titty factor is like the nurturing factor. Like that's the attraction is that she'll be good at nurturing. She has breasts for, but the ass thing is like an athletic body. It's like an exciting body. Oh, I'm banks can't fucked up. This dude who's three and five is teeing off bitch on form five. You Basically, oh yeah, he's foreign five tonight. Five motherfucker. I liked the fact, oh damn. I liked the fact he's done.

Speaker 2:          01:30:09       Done, done, done. I liked the fact that they throw knees. I do like that. I'm glad they could still throw knees and I think there are a lot of hold only with one hand though. That's it. His fights over. He's taking it. He's done. Done. Yeah. Let's go ahead and call us the day. Everybody. Wow. He's standing or not. We're Sni. I've ever seen Overeem. Fujita. Yeah, there was that one. I thought I'd killed him over and killed again. Overeem to share it. You ever see that one? Yes. To share with the crazy dreadlocks man. He hits with a knee and that dude is like, he went down like he was Danny Fajita Day. He was in the ring. Like there it goes, faces in cave like you so fucked up and that's Uber Rain. We're not talking about normal. Oh No. Like, oh, I don't know if he's going to win.

Speaker 2:          01:30:47       We're talking about fucking Japan over rain. Well, Japan, Japan over him. Once he hit that like k one grom pre heavyweights. Yeah. Fuck it. Don't they dug up Nazis that had special science just sued shit. Brought it into the lab. Well, this dude, uh, four five. What is his name? Do we know Jamie? Good for him, man. You know, I've seen this dude fight before. He's good. That was like a big victory. That was very impressive on bank. Took a beat. Is that Dr. Brooks like Irish fear got his ear pierced? Well, maybe he's wiling out. I'm sure he is. 100 hunter were chains on his neck to the back. Chest. Palmer. Hey, he's trying to make it happen. How dare you? How dare you? How dare you, dude. If I was like Joe Rogan, scrooge McDuck rich, I'm hiring scientists to build fake ass is like no other. I don't want to fake gas though. That's like the flat earth. Tough life. It's hard out there and you don't breed. Just like what happens if you know in the, in the wild, what happens if you have unfavorable characteristics, you get ate

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       up as first. That's how it goes. Oh, but we'll make it prevent way of the world. It's the way of the world. But how you can't prevent that with a piece of plastic. You can wave. They're going to be rented. No, no, no. You can give the illusion that you preventing it, but you know that ass is fake. It's the same thing with lips. Lips, you can't do to live. So he did the tits. They found a crazy loophole with tits and it works. They snuck in, they snuck in with a tid implants and everybody's like, well, hey, we could do it there. We could do it everywhere. But you can't. It only works on women's tits. Doesn't work on guys tits, dude, I'm not maggots. 10 implants. Women's lips. Girls don't want that shit. Some women's lips that a, I'm not mad at them.

Speaker 1:          01:32:35       They get a couple. We're going to talk off. Here we are. We really is. Nonsense. This is craziness bro. Who is this young gentlemen here? I've seen him fight before. Not a full crowd yet is this isn't the main card, is it? No, no. Robert Thomas Geoffery. If this is early in the card is early 22 yolks. My boy and the ride is jacked at 34 I think he's flourishing. Makes Sense though, right? I he's flexing a hundred. Got a beautiful beard though in a Mohawk. That's rare in flavors. Fresh off the set of 300 okay.

Speaker 1:          01:33:10       I think they're going to fix it with gene therapy. Dude, that's, that's the real fix. This plastic they shove in your ass and make your ass stick out isn't fooling anybody. The same thing with your lips like why are your lips bigger than all the surrounding tissue? That doesn't make any sense. They fool man with the lips. They full may bro might be a little bit basic. You know what? I might be a basic bitch. I like lips. I think a girl's lips are like really important when you're kissing a girl hockey over many of reasons, but if you're feeling like a rubber thing under there, I can't think that that would be good. It just looks weird to not if it's done right. Okay. Maybe I'm, maybe I'm wrong. There's a lot of state doctors out there. I hope so, but I think that the what what you're seeing now is like this.

Speaker 1:          01:33:57       It's the beginning. Like when they were, when they thought that they could put like feathers on people and have him jump off cliffs and it didn't work out or not. Well, eventually it became an airplane. Like somebody had, they keep saying like trying with that thought until they got it right and now you know, you get on a virgin airlines jet to Boston and you fucking got the beautiful red widget lighting. You have yourself a champagne. It all started from some asshole with a bunch of feathers. You thought it could jump off a cliff. True. It has to start there. And right now, these girls that you're looking at with these crazy fake lips and these plastic plates in their asses, they make their ass out. What they are is the dude with the feather jumping off the cliff and they're unfortunate demise and they get tangled up in the branches of the tree below. Their unfortunate demise will make people innovate. True. I'm with you, man. It's fine. I hope I'm around for that. What do we got here, Jamie? Oh Damn. This, this dude from Canada just landed a beautiful knee to the body. So we're watching these fights. Um, if you're watching

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       these at home, you might not even be able to, uh, there's no way you're going to sync this up, but we'll, we'll try to sync it up when once we get to Joe Schilling, stitch him up who, uh, is a little bit later on the card. Once we get to stitch them up, we'll tell you exactly what time it is and you could sync this thing up later. This fight him. I think mcnichols arena, that's the old school man isn't super old school. One of those few of these was that team Miss Denver at all in any way? You know what, now? Wow. It's weird, right? I go back and I feel like I'm in a country Western man. Denver people are going to eight me, but it's whatever, bro. It's true. It's my favorite spot. Oh, there's some great spots in. Have great family and friends, but you could not pay me to move back there, man.

Speaker 2:          01:35:42       I will never leave. My number one choice comedy works outside of a California, Colorado is my number one choice, either evergreen, evergreen, boulder, or Denver. He goes, my three spots that nature. Shit. I love the paint. Don't shit, Bro. You don't like, how would you kill some shit? But then I want to go back to Marina del Rey, jumping my Porsche and do some weird shit. As I've gotten older, I appreciate nature way more and more. I feel like it's like something that I just didn't, I didn't appreciate it enough until I got older. Like a, I think when I was younger I was always concentrating entirely on doing whatever I'm trying to do, whether it's fighting or going, getting into comedy, getting my career in line, you know, like becoming a professional comedian. And then, you know, all the things that I've ever done.

Speaker 2:          01:36:29       I've always been concentrated more on them than anything else. More on the, and then as I got older I started, well, what brings me pleasure? I started thinking like, what do, what do I enjoy being around? And one of the things that I enjoy being around was beautiful nature, likes to see a mountain. Like I remember going to, um, Jesus, I don't know where the fuck it was. Like one of the first I got us, you know what to hear. One of the big one was going to the aspen comedy festival, man. I went to the Aspen comedy festival, I want to say like 2002, I think it was like 2002. And, uh, I was in Aspen and I was driving with this dude who worked for the festival and he was telling me how he has elk off of his back porch. I didn't know elk screamed.

Speaker 2:          01:37:11       I did. I had no idea. I didn't know a goddamn thing about grain back then. And they scream elk. Bugling you never heard of elk? Bugling I recorded some of it from my trip. You, this is real shit that happened this week. Elk make it easier to kill you. They scream. Oh, they don't, they're not easy to kill it, man. There, especially with a bow, they're hard. But what it is is that they, um, they're trying to get some pussy so they call out to women or to let them know that they're the right to fuck. And they also call it the men. They're ready to challenge them and they, uh, they do battle. Like I'll show you some pictures of this dead one that they found. It got stabbed up. He got murked by some other fucking bull and they're big. These are a thousand pound animals. Just like the you killed bigger as big as the one I killed. Thanks fucking the one. The one that died was bigger than the one I kept bigger. Who killed him? Some bad ass. Bitch. Listen to this though. This is what it sounds like. Oh, it sounds like a grown man yelling.

Speaker 2:          01:38:10       Hello Sir. I'm here. It is. Listen. No Sir. You hear that? That's the guide. Trying to call them. He's making like a cow call to listen to the sound that they make when they respond. It's like a like a monster that, that high pitch shit. That's the guy making the call. Now listen to them.

Speaker 4:          01:38:42       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:38:43       You hear that almost sounds like Ortho whales.

Speaker 5:          01:38:48       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:38:50       Damn. They scream at each other like that. Now really loud one was the guide right next to us with the call. That's one of them screaming dad. That was an ALC.

Speaker 2:          01:39:11       Oh, weird. Right. Then do you listen to that and find out where they're at? Just destroy him. Well, you got to sneak up on them when you should know where they're at. He sneak up on them and then you hide behind stuff when you make calls like a cow. So they think they're going to get some pussy fucking basic bitch elks. Too easy. Become screaming too when they come towards you. That's one of the most nerve wracking parts about it. Oh yeah. Cause I think there'd be your hook. Exactly. Dick out there. Like, what's up? Will they come? They come all over themselves. They piss all themselves and come all themselves. They look at their whole under suicide. When you find them in the running. Is this covered with like common pis? They're all wet. They're looking for a good time. They're just, they're partying.

Speaker 2:          01:39:56       Fuck man. You guys just, Hey, what's up? Oh, raging boner, ted, bro. It is rude. But uh, it's also hot mountain lions fun too. When we were in Colorado, one of the guys I was with, uh, told me that they had found this mountain lion on top of this elk and they found it by following the, uh, the path that it took once a drag the elk. So what he found was like you could see the mountain lion footprints and then he could see the elk footprints and then they collide. And then there's no more mountain line footprints because the mountain lion is riding the elks back. Can you get this 1200 pound elk in this 150 pound cat is on its back biting its neck and it runs like 102 hundred yards with this cat on its back. And then it piles up and then the cat eats it.

Speaker 2:          01:40:49       They catch the cat on top of this thing. You know what man? I think the reason why I don't get down with nature and mountains and stuff, cause I grew up in Denver man. So I was, I was going camping all the time. Uh, I was shooting arrows when I was young and shit. So I'm over it man. I love the ocean. I can't get enough of the ocean. Yeah, see that's it. You're, you're experiencing the new nature. So then the next, I mean the ocean is, I rented a place in Malibu for like three months this last summer and uh, I would wake up every morning just looking at that water going, wow. I feel like there's nothing crazy. Love it. It's crazy. It's a crazy view and it's a, it's a morphing view. Like in the daytime it's inviting and it's night. At nighttime it's terrifying. Terrifying. And that that's the only difference. The only difference is you can't see. Yeah. Would you ever live in Malibu?

Speaker 2:          01:41:41       I don't know if it's wise to buy a home next to the water. I don't know if it's wise to spend several million dollars for a house that's stuck in the sand right in front of the lip of the ocean. You want to talk about basic bitches? Like are you not paying attention to the entirety of the human history that's been recorded about the changing of the earth's atmosphere and about how the, like you find cities that are underwater, there were like Roman cities and shit and other underwater. Why? Why are they underwater? Well, they're underwater because there's the, the ocean moves expense. It's not stuck there. It's not going to stay. Exactly. If you're looking for investment 2000 years from now, yeah, probably don't buy a house in Malibu. However, for when you're alive, you should be fine, Joe. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Maybe, but maybe not.

Speaker 2:          01:42:30       I can almost guarantee. How about fun? What happened in Japan? That shit could happen in Malibu in the day and Indian, you need need day. I have a friend who lives in Pacific Palisades. It's got a nice sweet spot up a hill and uh, I could want you to live by the water. You've got a lot of money. He goes, so nominees tsunamis. I go, really? He goes, yeah. He goes, they happen. He goes, they might not happen, but they happen. And when they happen, guess what? What are you gonna hear? You can hear a horn mill the night I sleep with a sound machine. I have a sound machine next to my bed place. Sounds like birds and shits or get sleep. That's what he said. He goes, I'm not drowning in death. God Damn, that's dark. I mean, fuck bro. I live right on. You know I live on the marina.

Speaker 2:          01:43:09       The way they sold me. They're like, you have a tsunami comes thing. I said, really? There? Yeah, I'll take it tilts. I'll take it, save all that shit. It's going to fill up with water. [inaudible] up, man. The real tsunami, the real bad motherfuckers. It's going to drown it. It's going to be all under water, like the idea of like 500 feet of water up and down. That's nothing in the history of the world. That shit's happened. Thousands sometimes role. Just how you're not a real estate fucks. Say I'd be like, look, what you really want to do is you want to be on top of the mountain looking down and you want to have a raft up there. Yeah, man. You got to have like Noah art. I don't know if that's a reason not to live by the beach. No beach town side. It's still awesome.

Speaker 2:          01:43:56       If you were like super baller, like Richard Branson type character, you really ideally want to houses. You want a house at the top of the mountain. Now you want three, you want a house at the top of the mountain, you want to fat place in the city and then you want a spot on the wall. You want to do that. If you're going to be a fucking super baller scrooge McDuck style. Yeah you, but you got to have like, you know, fucking Shell oil type money if you want to do it right. A lot of money and having three mansions. I'm not talking about mansions. Maybe have a condo downtown like a dope ass penthouse. That's a good move. Yeah man. I'm a, I'm not a big fan of living downtown because the God damn traffic, but you know, it's tough man. It's brutal. It's brutal to get downtown's row ruthless.

Speaker 2:          01:44:40       But I would never live down, but it's kind, Kinda dope. Like, like you could walk around downtown now and it's like he's cleaning up and ls putting a ton of money into it. They want it to be like the hot new hot spot. So it's a good place to buy it. They got to kill bums. There's only one way they're going to have to kill some bumps. What the fuck you sit. We're kidding folks. We're not kidding. Well, I'm not going to have crappy value. We don't have to get rid of them. No, I'm just kidding. This guy, first of all, this dude from Canada is a mother fucker dude. The guy in the black shorts is he from Canada? 22 two and he's bad ass man. This is a tough fight that other time that the other two is taking some serious body shots.

Speaker 2:          01:45:17       Third round here. Um, I just think that uh, the bump thing is, it's all bullshit aside. You know, obviously I don't think you should kill him, but when you look, you stop and look at it. If it's a horrible indictment of how flawed our current system of community is, that our community allows people to get so disenfranchised, there's an entire, like a whole ecosystem of people in downtown La. I get that. I look at it and they make me sad when people don't know what we're talking about. Like if they'd ever seen skid row, like these people that are listening to us like, oh, you're being so mean about homeless people. It's is a different thing. It's like walking dead. But imagine all the zombies in one place and they will eat your dick off for crack. It is really crazy. It's, it's one of the craziest things you'll ever say that there's a ton of them in Venice to man.

Speaker 2:          01:46:06       Oh yeah. Tom In Venice. Yeah. They get uncomfortable too. And you're out those uh, Venice beach spots when they gather and you know, they want money from tourists so they start bagging. Yeah. It's, it's rough. Well, it was a lot of crazy people. That's really what it is. It's a mental health issue that gets thrown around a lot for everything. Right. I think some of our mental health, I think some were just like, fuck, fuck it man. Yep. I think also though saying fuck it though is a bit of a mental health issue or is it just called giving up? I think even that is mental health. Like don't you think it's healthy to have good friends? It's healthy to be a good friend. It's healthy to be in love. It's healthy to be fulfilled by your pursuits in life, whether it is a, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       your artistic pursuits or athletic pursuits or your career pursuits, those are, that's a health issues. It's like isn't it healthy to exercise? Right? That's a physical health issue actually. He doesn't, he doesn't exercise well then he's nice, right? But when you talk and consider physical health, physical health is dependent upon choices. It's dependent upon dietary choices and it's dependent upon choices that you make as far as like how much exercise you do and that's your health. I think mental health is the same thing. I think there's aspects of mental health that are undeniable, just like these aspects of physical health that are undeniable. There's people that are born with horrible physical diseases and, and, and, and there's not much they can do it physically to overcome those. And there's all sorts of deformities and all sorts of real problems that people have that are physical.

Speaker 1:          01:47:40       But then there's also people that are just fucking overeating lazy fucks and they develop heart disease. Well isn't that a physical health issue? Well, it most certainly is and have that physical health health issue manifests itself through choices and decisions and your actions and so then it becomes a mental health issue as well. So it's a physical health issue, but it's also a mental health issue because it's your mental health that is out of line that allows your physical health that gets so fucked up, but also sort of people's experiences in life. I don't know if I take to mental a mental health issue where they have an issue with their brain, you know what I'm saying? Where it's chemically different. Sometimes they might not have had the same opportunities as other people and just say, listen man, fuck this. Like maybe they lost a family member.

Speaker 1:          01:48:22       Maybe they lost their job and they're thinking, oh, I'm sick of this shit man. Yeah, that's true. Some of that. But I think that could be considered a mental health issue. I think t's, I think prom with people chalk it up. Everything has mental health like these, like these uh, shooters, these calls or these random shooters. It's always a mental health thing. Yes, right. Oh well it's a mental thing and that's an easy get away. They might just be fucked up man. Bad people. Some things up. If people are just evil, man, we could, but that also is I think could be considered a mental health issue and I think the word mental health, we get thrown around like we look at health and disease and issues like that or where you're not, you're not balanced in an order. We look at it like, oh, Jimmy caught gonorrhea.

Speaker 1:          01:49:07       Well that guy's got a disease he needs to penicillin. But if you're just a lazy fuck that eats like Shit and eventually your heart gives out. You have heart disease and that is a physical disorder. It's a physical disorder that came from you not having discipline for whatever reason, making poor choices so it manifests itself in a physical condition. It can also manifest itself in a, in a a mental condition because you could be at a point where we'd given up on that feed. Is that what's going on? I got a lot of messages just saying that that was the prelims and the act main card is going on now alive. Oh, nice. On the West. So it was just the prelims line website and that was what it was playing. So the main car supposedly is live now. Oh, so what we were when they were saying that we were watching, we were watching the prelims.

Speaker 1:          01:49:53       Yes. Okay. That makes sense. So, um, okay, now that we have that, let's put up the card on the, okay, cool. Um, but I think the word disease is an issue and the word health is an issue because it's, it's really like we categorize things like health and disease and we, we, we like, we'd get real rigid with how we, uh, look at them and we look at things like health and these people that have disorders. When you have addictions, when you have compulsion's, when you have a negative behavior that you can't help but keep continuing to repeat over and over again, self sabotaging behavior, that is a mental health issue. When you have obsessive, like you're a stalker, you start stalking a girl, you won't leave her alone. You're obsessed with her. Check her Facebook, her like that's that obsession is a disorder. Like you could call it a mental health issue.

Speaker 1:          01:50:43       You could call it as you could call it behavioral malfunction. True. But it's, you're not healthy mentally and it, so it is a mental health issue. Like if you go into a school and you shoot people 100% you have a mental health issue, 100% 100% the issue is you can't be mentally healthy and want to go and shoot random people just so people know your name. You can't want that if you want that you are mentally unwell. And so I think when we look at things like, oh, it's not his fault, he has a mental health disorder. Oh that's just a cop out. Well, no, he's responsible for whatever that disorder his butt. He most certainly has a disorder. Like when someone's a rapist, the bill Cosby, okay, he's got a mental health issue. It doesn't exonerate him. It doesn't say that he should be free.

Speaker 1:          01:51:31       And no one should, no one should prosecute him. And you know, he should somehow or another be treated instead of a locked up. No, no, that's not what I'm saying. But you have to have a mental health issue in order to drug women and fuck them when they were unconscious. You have to have a total disconnect for feeling about that woman's health, her safety, her, her physical solidarity or, or, or, or physical, um, uh, her, her ability to, to like own her own body and own her own consciousness. Like to, for you to want to bypass that with a pill so you could stick your Dick in her like you have to be mentally, he was raised that way. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because you even, you can be mentally raised to be racist like we were talking before. Or you can be raised in a mental pattern where you're homophobic though all those are absolutely a hundred percent possible.

Speaker 1:          01:52:29       But at the end of the day, you're still mentally unwell. Like you're mentally unwell because of the way you were raised, your mentally unwell in spite of the way you were raised. It doesn't matter. You're mentally unwell. Like, and I think if we look at behavior like overall, like what is conducive to a happy experience for you and the people that you encounter, what is conducive to you being fulfilled in your life and having great friendships and great relationships. What is conducive to that? Well, if you move towards that and he tried to eliminate all the errors that you keep repeating and making and you recognize those that's healthy, that's healthy. Well this is the thing though. So if, if I, if I am a of mental health issues, there's a lot of negative that comes with it, right? So, so if I, whatever have this weird, uh, inclination to, to molest boys or whatever for whatever reason, there you will for whatever, whatever it is.

Speaker 1:          01:53:25       Or to rape girls. Yeah. Right, right. It's going to be tough to get help, right? Because you have this negative connotation with that. Sure. So that's why it keeps going on. Well, that's certainly a part of it. And also there's not, and I'm not promoting any of this fucking bullshit, but I'm just saying there's no like safe house for them. Right? Like they can't go be like, hey man, listen, I have this weird fantasy where I fucking loved him. Less little kids, people like Wyatt. You know what I'm saying? Like there's no, there's no outlet for him. It's true. I mean, to have a fantasy where you victimized small children is like the most taboo and forbidden fantasy ever. You can't even pee jerk off to that. But if you hadn't, can't even vote 10, you're super fucked. Well, say if a guy, um, say if you're married, right?

Speaker 1:          01:54:05       And uh, you know, maybe your wife puts on a few pounds, but you want to stay married and you don't want to cheat on her. And yet she doesn't want to have sex anymore. Maybe she's older and she gets the menopause and you just go into your garage or wherever the fuck you keep your porn and you whack going off every now and then just went off to stay sane. Yeah, everything else is great, but when you're closing your eyes, you're whacking off and you're looking at porn, you're looking at some dirty girl that tattoo on her lower back, she sucking Dick and you just want to her sure. See you get, you're allowed to indulge those fantasies. If you're a man, like if you're a guy was no chance whatsoever of a banging some super hot porn star 10 yeah. You could still jerk off watching her.

Speaker 1:          01:54:47       Fuck you can. So that's what you like. Yeah. You could still jerk off watching someone just hold her hair and just mouth fucker. You can do that and no repercussions. Like you can never have sex with that girl ever, but you could jerk off to her having sex and have no repercussions. That's your taste. Right? But if your taste is like young boys, like twinks, like 15 year old tanks, you, you have nothing. Everything is illegal. It doesn't even mean that you want to go out and have sex with those young boys like, or you plan on having sex with us was like, you can't even jerk off to them. So what leads me to question like what happens if in the future they figure out virtual reality, like they get virtual reality to a point where it's just you can't, anything goes, anything goes in virtual reality. So you have these artificial young boys that blow you. Will that be illegal because no one's getting hurt there. These artificial boys are made a three d polygons are connected together with some visual

Speaker 2:          01:55:45       video effects engine. It's harder because it satisfies the urge. Right? And they're not doing to actual humans. Yeah. Right. But eight that urge though, you want to cut it out of the society. Okay. So what are you doing it with these guys? All right. I'm with you. Them in the bank. You might have to them in the bum. They met him. Bumps. See Ya. I, I wish there was a way to just rewire you. I mean, I wish, I mean in all, I bet a lot of people who have all those issues, those real dark people who are unhappy, you don't think they wish they could be rewired. Sure. Man. Even gamblers, you ever meet? I'll take some great wine. Rambler. Few things. Yeah. You know what's really interesting, someone was talking to me about this stuff, fat guy that I know and his wife was saying that it's Kinda crazy because first of all, that guy, what's his name, halls and, and is the biggest 185 pounds a large human because gigantic for one 85.

Speaker 2:          01:56:38       I liked, I liked Michael Page. Michael, he's fun to watch. His talents are almost wasted in that division that he's competing against. He needs to fight like a much higher caliber of fighter. He's collecting paychecks. What was I just saying? We're just talking about, oh, you have a fat friend. Oh. And his wife was like, here's the difference between being addicted to anything else. Like if you're addicted to cigarettes, you stopped smoking cigarettes and then, you know, he kicked the habit. But if you're addicted to food, you have to eat food. It's a legit boy. It was a very legit point. I thought about it. I want to, Whoa, it's a super legit point. Obviously I don't have food issues. I'm known have, um, you know, um, a real, uh, food addiction. But over the last nine days, I quit eating sugar, lost six pounds. Now as of today, six fucking pounds.

Speaker 2:          01:57:27       And I'm not trying like, I'm just eating normal. I'm doing the same. Doing more cardio or anything? Nope. Same amount. Everything's the same. Everything's the same. But you're getting your sugar from where? From the bucket name all the mango things. Yeah. I thought you were c two o c two delicious and sweet. But it's, that's natural. That's just the coconut from fruit or whatever. Yeah. Fruits. Fine. I've been eating bananas every day and I eat oranges and apples. I eat a lot of fruit, but uh, like those mangoes. So it's Chili. Mangoes are so God damn good. Heaven ain't much. I came in, I felt that bad enough that you know what? Yo Lo, fuck this. When's the last area? Lo? I don't know why that came out of my mouth. I don't know why that came out of my mouth. I don't even talk. Lights got added sugar.

Speaker 2:          01:58:10       That's the problem. It's not just the sugar from the dried mangoes. Did they put sugar and then the chili sauce together? The chippy Chili Pepper together, mangoes from heavens. When I say heaven dust, oh you mean sugar, I'm fucking addicted man. So I go nine days in and I decided I'm going on a month. Then I'm gonna see what happens when I make it to a month. You know what though? You're a real discipline type of dude who can do that. You know what I'm saying? Like you, you stick something in your fucking sticking to it. One thing I know about you, I definitely do, but what I'm thinking is why I'm doing this. I'm man, I don't even have an issue and this is like overwhelming my thoughts. Like a lot of the day, like where I see like a hot dog with a nice white roll on a white bun to white bread.

Speaker 2:          01:58:51       I'm not eating that shit. I'm not eating that. So I see that hot dog with fucking Sauerkraut on it. Ooh, you ever go to home depot and they have the hot dog cart in front of Home Depot. All those things are so fucking good mother fucker to get me. I'm going to have for our hammer. I'm trying not to hammer. I'm not trying to buy a hot dog too. I ended up walking out what that hot dog and a Chiro. They get that Cheryl and I'm like, fuck it. I'll, you know what gets me with them. God Damn Churros the Charles and the funnel cakes and Mickey mouse ears on and Shit feeling like, Shit, I'm done dude. I'm not no, no sugar for this month. So I'm gonna see what happens. And at the end of the month I'm going to see how I feel and what I look like. This is the helped me, but is I'm assuming that everyone in your household this way, because if they're not, you're going to have troubles.

Speaker 2:          01:59:34       Now, I used to date a girl who, uh, I was trying to eat real healthy, but she literally had crazy genetic. She would eat fast food every night. So I'd be like eating fucking, you know, Broccoli and chicken. She's balls deep in a 12 piece chicken nugget. You know what I'm saying? It's tough, man. It is. But when I get it in my head, it doesn't matter. You could eat pizza right in front of it. A beast with it. Well, I just, I have switches. I have like, okay, now you don't do this anymore and that's it. And once I don't do that anymore, I don't do that anymore because then if I do do it, if I give in, that'll permeate itself from the rest of my life. That'll, that'll leak itself into my other comedy leak itself into my workouts. It'll leak itself in everything you do that with your social life.

Speaker 2:          02:00:17       If someone fucked you over and you're like your dad to me off, as soon as, as soon as they like, you will run into people that will like either sabotage you or do a bad business deal with you or try to fuck you in some way. And you know, you can't hate him. I forgive him like as a person, but I won't associate with them anymore. No. Yeah, there's no, yeah, no, no, no. You mean you'd have to like have some insane apology with the, a real explanation and then, you know, we'd probably have to work our way back to a French or she'll slow, but when someone fucks you over, I can't, you can't tolerate that because those people become problems. And those people, that's a pattern that like, like if you, uh, if you have a friend and like, especially like you hear about friends going into business together and then like they start a restaurant or something and one guy fucks off with the cash and they wind up fighting each other.

Speaker 2:          02:01:12       My stepdad and his, uh, his, um, he had a business partner and architectural firm and they beat each other up one day. Should it be each other? Like he came home, he had a black eye and he was, you know, in his forties and I was a kid. I was like, what? First of all, I was like, I was fighting back down to zero skills. It's like this, like what did this fight look like between, cause I knew his basic guess Stepdad or worse, but it's like he's a good guy. He's in a bad person, but I knew the guy fought with two. I'm like, that's even more ridiculous that that guy gave you a black eye because that has to be there. It was so bad. Well it was a very complicated situation where they had uh, government contracts and then, um, the government lost money.

Speaker 2:          02:01:57       Um, like there was like a d uh, there was a recession and during the recession they cancel a lot of their contracts. And so these guys had put all this time and work and effort into these projects and the projects were pulled out from under them and all their investment was done super fun. It was really bad. And you know, they all, I'm sure there was a lot of blame on both sides and who knows what the fuck happened. But it's weird when you see someone come home, your Stepdad gets, got a black eye. What earth? Like if I was braiding shop, it'd be like, for sure. Keep your hands up next time for sure. Don't let them get that close to you. Talk my shit to each other. My Dad get in a fight when I was 12 I'm not making this up. W whatever fucking cars.

Speaker 2:          02:02:43       Right. My Dad pulls in front of him. He pulls it from my dad. He gets out. My Dad goes, you want to fucking go? My Dad's like, oh no, like an old school Irish boxer. Oh No. I remember being like 10 or 11 being like, ah, fuck man. See the problem with that is Nick Diaz can actually fight like that. Oh my dad makes off this dude. Yeah. It was about to throw them off the side of the highway and a leather jacket. Oh No, I did not fuck around when a guy stands out like that. So I was doing the old school boxing. One of two things can happen. He's trying to scare you off or he's so good with his hands. He's just Kinda roll actually. Like what's up dude? You want some? Yeah, man. Yeah, he was weird. I'll tell you what, for real man, I remember my dad get out of the car.

Speaker 2:          02:03:27       I'm like, God dammit. And then my brother gets out, kicks, guiding the balls from behind. [inaudible] was probably 12 at the time. He's Christ brother kicked a grown man in the room in the balls. But that's when it gets really dangerous when that kid gets involved, own father becomes like super violent. Little Brown was doing what was a little crying in the back seat. How old were you? Probably like 10 or 11 crying in the back seat. Can't be trusted if she goes down. Our nurse on my stepdad fight but it's, I'm almost getting a fight once we got in a minor car accident, like a little fender bender when I was like eight or nine years old and I was as young kids and saw the car and they got out swearing and yelling and I was like, oh no, I was so scared. So skin, oh so scared.

Speaker 2:          02:04:09       Cause he wasn't a tough guy either. I was told me cry. So vulnerable, prominent on might have. I don't think so cause I don't think it got to the point where anybody hit anybody. So I probably see, I would definitely have cried if they hit each other. Yeah, I would've been terrified. But that's how people die. You know, that's how people wind up killing the whole family was real man, knocked the guy out. The Guy Falls, hits his head, you go, we got to get rid of the family and they just, they mark Burg wife, free butter kids. That shit happens. You know, you run into the wrong biker gang. True. They're messed up and trying to prove their hardness for sure. Shit happens. Carbon w you know you're the wrong race. You know you're a black guy and there's a, you know, you have a white girlfriend maybe.

Speaker 2:          02:04:49       Who the fuck knows man? Yeah man. Anything. You know. How about transgender people? How about a transgender person gets in the car accident with a bunch of fucking amped up dudes? Oh the fuck. Yeah. I mean, and you're on a dirt road somewhere in the middle of nowhere and you just decided to beat this guy. The dude, I need a gun for real man. If you need any fucking, most people really need a gun. Oh yeah. That should alarm everybody because I can fight. Yeah. People need it done right. It's a weird thing out there. You could run it to the wrong people. And I've had people say that to me like you're so paranoid, you know, like why do you want to learn martial arts? Like I had this conversation with Mark Marin wants about this, you know, it's like well is that really gonna Happen?

Speaker 2:          02:05:28       Like you're really worried about it. Like I've seen it like I know bad people. I've seen people do bad things to be blessing people hit people and they didn't have to, I just can't be set the same thing. Cause I asked him, I'm like why should I have a gun? He's like, cause if shit goes down you want to be prepared man. He goes, I never go anywhere without a gun. He goes, cause my wife and my kids are depending on me. It was the 11th that guy has a gun and yeah I have all these findings because what the fuck am I going to do? He was, I would never let them down. And he's, you know, world class fighter worldclass and he's saying this, I was like, damn, I need a gun. But he's always trying to find one off the black market.

Speaker 2:          02:06:02       Why would you from when you can get one for Rome? And he was like, get the fuck out it. Yeah. Don't even say it was a joke. It was a Joe. Yeah. Lie. We lie. We just lied you 100%. You can get one. You know, legally. You gotta feel easier today. Yeah. It's not hard. It's not hard. Wink, wink, wink. It's not hard to get a gun in California. Paperwork and shit and not hard. Do I have to take lessons? No, that's what's crazy. Whose phone is that? Is that mine or yours? I wouldn't, definitely not mine. Um, you, you don't have to like fill out paperwork. At least he didn't. When I did, I mean for paperwork as far as like take a test, just kind of give me the goddamn thing. It's not a hard like a hunter safety. Like when you take a, you take a hunter safety course, um, you could, you do most of that online and then you go and take like a class.

Speaker 2:          02:06:51       Is there a weight class you, I don't want to do that. I'm going to go black market. Is there a, is there a, is there a waiting period for what? For a guy full. Yes. Yes sir. I don't want to, I don't hand handgun for any kind of firearm. There's a gun. There's a waiting period. They have to find off. You're crazy. They have to find out if you're a felon, it's running from the law. They have to find out if you're really Brendan shop, Bro, give me a goddamn gun on me, bro. Goddamn gun. You can get a gun, man. It wouldn't be any problem. But Joey Diaz can't get a gun. Joey Diaz is a felon. That makes sense. Yeah. If you're a felon, you can't get a gun that, I mean that's, yeah, it's tricky man. Joey Diaz. But, but makes sense if you just look at his record on paper.

Speaker 2:          02:07:30       Yeah. It's tough to sell that guy gun. Well, it's just, it seems like a questionable moe. Legit. I mean, there's a reason for the law. You will, you watch his podcast even watch that. The morning thing that he does. We see a hoax that's high. The morning joint. Yeah, it's he stays. He's doing peer skill. Yes. I stopped fucking pair of scout man. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gay. People get super excited about it, but the excitement waned. It went away and I was like, yeah, you know, I don't like it either. And then Facebook's doing video streaming, you know? Really? Yeah. They're all, that's video streaming. That's right. For out for however long you want. Dude, we should start streaming on Facebook. That's what people are streaming and cut out the middleman. Youtube. Well, youtube is not bad to youtube. We make money off youtube. Make money off ads.

Speaker 2:          02:08:17       They play ads. No, for sure. Podcast. Yeah, you can make money off of videos. I make money off my haters videos. People make mean videos about me. I put ads on them. Type Move Tropo. Yeah, type move, man. Shit. That's fun money. Keep on keeping on. Ultimately. I mean, do you get that much hate though? Shore. Really sure. I don't see it. Oh, you got to look around. I don't see why I don't look at the four people. Well, if people hate every show that is on the air, there's going to be a certain percent. It was like we were talking about, you have a guy like, like that was talking about that Milo, God, but even you or even Callen or anyone who I love, there's going to be a certain percentage of people that fucking hate them. Can't stand that. It's just everybody's not for everybody.

Speaker 2:          02:09:09       That dude went down from those fucking leg kicks, man. Some big boys tattooed on the left is throwing some nasty leg kicks, a white guys getting ate up. He's down from those legs. Really big boys. When you see like good high level kickboxing, it makes you realize like a lot of the kickboxing that you see in MMA especially like like doesn't this level. It just doesn't compare like this. The one you're watching here, these guys are going well to myself. Oh boy wants out. Yeah, he does. He's one of my left leg kick. Yeah, for sure. Don't bend over like, yeah. When he kicked that left leg, you can see that the thunder bolt, the pain go up into his dome. Um, yeah. People hate everything, man. There's somebody out there to hates fucking led Zeppelin. Somebody out there that hates Bob Seger. There's something out there that it wants Billy Joel to jump into the river and drowns in his own feces as, as long as it's 60 40 you're good.

Speaker 2:          02:10:01       But if everyone hates you, you might just be fuck. Why do you think 60 40 is good? I think what's probably good is like 80 20 or 70 30 but yeah, it should be on the higher end for sure. Oh, it's just a day. 60 40 is like, hmm, maybe you need to tighten up your fucking game. Tighten it up. You suck. And it's also like, there's like a problem with doing things like a podcast because you're talking and you might have an opinion that there's not the same as the person who's listened to and they can't talk back and it's fucking frustrating.

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       I think you're talking some shit about like maybe some music that they love or some food that they love or whatever the fuck it is, and they're listening and they get mad. Like, I'm fucking tired. Listening is bullshit. You know, you fucking idiot. You don't know shit. You fuck. And it's because it's an intimate relationship, but it's very one way true. But however, if you listen to a hundred Joe Rogan podcast, the Joe Rogan expansion isn't 101 of them piss you off and then you become a hater off that one. Well, that's not lose my fucking number necessarily have to be the case. They can be a hater from the jump, you know? Oh, well then there's just a hater. Then they're looking for any reason. It's just always punch. I'll tell you why I made the smartest thing I ever did was that podcast before. I got so much hate.

Speaker 3:          02:11:14       Fucking people hated me or standing. I get it. I mean, I dressed like Jay Leno and I get a fucking part in my head. You know what I'm saying? Like I get it. Part looks good. Yeah. It depends who you ask. I like it. It's like a giant Tobey Maguire. Just depends. People that hate, you know they don't, they don't matter. Yeah, I agree. They don't matter. I'm just saying the best thing I ever did was the podcasts because people are like, oh, he's not that big of a dick. Yeah. Well they didn't understand a lot of like when you would say things like this is just your personality, your sense of humor. Like they think this guy really thinks he's the shit. Well yes and no. Like in a way. Yeah, but in another way. No. Like he's having fun. This is fun. Yeah. What is this?

Speaker 3:          02:11:54       Kevin Hart and the soccer player? David Beckhams, this soccer player, soccer player that they always try to sneak in on us, not buying it. I get it. I get it. He's cute. Whatever. Well, whatever he is, get outta here. It's not working. Oh, hello. I live in America land. The free home of the brave. We don't give a fuck who the world ping pong champion is. Okay. But soccer bro, same thing. He's the captain of England for a long time. Darts. Who gives a fuck sick. His fate was sealed when he came home to La to play with the Mexicans. It's fate was sealed. They didn't even give a fuck about them. A few, like really a few really horny girls in their thirties came down because they were like super attracted him to work. David back didn't work as work. So No, I'm saying it didn't work as far as like getting us to buying the soccer did not work.

Speaker 3:          02:12:46       Did Not paid them like one, two gillion dollars didn't work and like seven people showed up. No one give a feel like this is still soccer. David Beckham is hot ticket. What we need is a recognizable face. We got them too late. We got in too late. It didn't matter if he's fucking man, Diego Maradona in his and he's got a dick. It's made out of gold. It doesn't matter. It's still soccer, soccer stuff. If that guy was playing baseball, Holy Shit Dude. Make a rod. You know? I mean the, the, the damage that guy's like a rod do. I mean he would, he would make that look silly. I agree. He would be way better. He's, he's a beautiful man. Oh, a piece tattooed up too. But he doesn't have the build. It doesn't have to build because in soccer it's like not important to have muscles. You look, I feel like some bitches be

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       the ones you don't want to fuck Trump tie. Right? Oh, you're 100% yeah. What do you want those? Nah. Well those girls who want a guy that's tight, he's tired all the time. A guy like a weak frame kind of gets neck pains. That's not what they want. No, that's not what they want. They want a big brown. The super athlete. Dick, was that a, the stoppage of that fight? Well, some girls, like some girls, like real skinny dudes. Oh, in all seriousness, some girls like dudes there look like they're like don't eat. I think the, I saw a study where the, where the the most appealing for women. It was like kind of that dad bod, like not a real rip dude, but not a fat dude. Some fat dude was trying to get some pussy. It's bullshit. They're trying to and you hate whoever wrote that gives you a rare deal and they trying to get into the heads where they say all the women out there and like, like hypnotize them.

Speaker 1:          02:14:24       It's true. Well they already did it with the fucking skinny bitches. Those, the models leave their coat racks. Girls Look at those models and think that's what they need to look like. Other girls, not for guys. Right? But they think that's what they're supposed to look like. If they just want it to look good for guys, they would listen to us. It's called honey doing squats and they would be eating pasta or rice slideshows. Nice sour cream, boom. Sauerkraut and pork chops, pork chop on the basic bitch carb and carb up stairs, ruts. You got to work those glutamates and I says, but to like women who like look at those like really tall, thin women, they think that that's, that's what they have to achieve. Who's off fuck the fuck it's from television man. It's from movies. It's from books. It's from magazines rather.

Speaker 1:          02:15:14       It's so what do the guys get the guys get we, we get, we look towards what the Rock and shit and muscle fitness. Yeah there's, there's that and then there's like a ridiculously people like guys who are just like super shredded six pack guys are sitting around like almost like, you know that guy when he took that photo shoot didn't eat for at least a day dehydrated himself to show his ass. He was on an eight week funding cut to get the, when you see ads and guys look insanely ripped and they have like chiseled six packs either they're a freak of nature, which is occasionally have those, a guy just looks insane no matter what he does like the Kevin Randleman look, you know, or oh you mean black people? That's what I was going, sorry. Or sorry. You, you got a guy who is preparing for a photo shoot who's in a very unhealthy and dehydrated state. You know when you see those guys for people that don't know, if you watch bodybuilding and you see those guys in there on that podium at that stage and their flex in and you see the strike [inaudible], they will black out. If you made those guys run up a hill, they would literally black out and fall down. They have a zero endurance. They would die. If that competition lasted four days

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       dead, they'd be dead. They'd be dead. If it was like an endurance thing where you had to keep the competition going over days and days, they would be gone. It'd be gone. Yeah. They don't look like that. Yeah, there's, it's not healthy. You can't do that. So if men had a body dysmorphia thing, it would be about being ripped. Like that's why when that girl was fucking with you 100% saying you were soft, feel like, Ooh. She's like, she's saying you don't look like this unrealistic person from these magazines that I'm fingering myself too. And I said, bitch, you don't look like Nicki Minaj. Where are we going to do? What are we going to do? She wasn't even back then, that she wasn't popular. I didn't really work. I probably said, did you guys have an argument over it? No, I, I was just like, you were hurt.

Speaker 2:          02:17:12       Uh, yeah. And I was like, I'm sad, sad. I state this girl used to tell me about her ex boyfriend who she dated this big giant body builder dude, that he used to pick her up and fuck her up against the wall. And I'm like, do you really think I want to hear that? You don't want to know that. So why do you want to tell me about some big Guy? He used to pick you up and fuck you against the wall because I can pick you up and fuck you against the wall. You're not that big. Yeah. If you want to do that, she'll, yeah, I'm strong enough to do that. But I don't need to know about other than you. I like to pretend that specific way that you can, like I'm the first one and I don't fucking picture any of that man.

Speaker 2:          02:17:48       I still a bit about that, that every girl should say, is that what a Dick looks like? I'm so glad I waited. That would be great. That would be fucking brilliant. Speaking is how I've always thought it would be the best way to suck it and then just do an ace five star Bordeaux style wifey and you're like, wait a minute. How'd you learn? Ho I don't want to know. I don't want it. I don't want to know. I'll just pretend you fucking learned it off videos. Speaking of, speaking of Dicks, did you speaking to take Justin Bieber's Dick? Cause I get to bring up, I knew it. I knew you were going to bring up a dude. It's got a good Dick. Good sized hoggy items. Kids happy kids gets killing the game, Bro. Think that maybe he like pulled it out a little, fluffed it out a little blood flow, knew everybody was going to see it.

Speaker 2:          02:18:37       You know he had that die piece of a girl waiting on the couch, so I'm sure he phoned her. He's Justin Bieber and then was like, you know what? I'm going to get butt naked, play some guitar on the balcony and someone caught them like, I don't think he's walking around with that big old hug like that. That's true, but also making it though. Maybe it doesn't give a fuck. Maybe when you have $300 million and you're 19 you're like, maybe I'll just go show my hog and everybody for real dog out for a walk. Especially take feral hog out on the balcony, this hog up for a little stroll and he's got to think like as famous as he is at everything he does, he's constantly got people. Try to take pictures of him. You'll have, if you have that hoggy though, it's like fuck it.

Speaker 2:          02:19:17       Why not? Yeah, let it, let it breathe, Bro. Let it shine. Quit hating on the Dick. That's a good point. Yeah. Right pony. Legit point. Good for him. See that something. Forget about squats. Forget about titty implants, lips, then out a God damn thing. You can do nothing. Not incredible that if you look at the game when the genetic game, all right, that one of the number one things is dick size number one things. Number one, one of the number one things and that is the one fucking nut that science can't crack. We could put a man on the moon. We can send video from your fucking cell phone to a dude in Australia. Instantaneously we could, you can download Netflix on the ride to the airport. I mean, you're pulling movies out of the sky. Hindu some shit. God Damn, you can do some shit.

Speaker 2:          02:20:07       You could Skype with people there on the other side of the planet. Talk to them in real time. Look at them like I'm looking at you. That's all possible. Can't fix that Dick. Can't fix this arc, bro. Sorry. Uh, how, how, how close are you getting close, close, man. Nine o'clock and I'm just shit out. Nothing. We could cut the tendon in the bottom and stretch it out, but I mean, what can you do? Me a half an inch. My Buddy, I won't say his name obviously has a small Dick. I was at his house the other day awhile ago, found a Dick extender for his girl. He saw, he saw me, he saw me see this fucking adapter. I sleep Damson I get it bro. You coulda. I coulda roasted them hard, hard for having a tiny Dick and having a Dick extender. Now when you say Dick extended like a rubber Dick that you put on top of your house to help your girl out cause she here's a Tater tot dick. So he put this thing on top of it.

Speaker 2:          02:21:02       It's a bomber, bro. Me Being the nice guy just looked at him, said, I get it. It's just carry on with your night. It is what it is, man. Number man. You can't do shit like if, if you're real skinny, all right, whatever. You can lift weights, eat right. Maybe even by some steroids we can figure some shit out. Like you said, your Dick. We've got three d printing where we're making all sorts of fucking new Oregon's whatever the fuck you went. We can't do dick. I got a question. When you see like women that are bodybuilders and they take steroids, they, their clit grows and then it becomes like a dick. Do you think of a dude got on some crazy ass fucking steroids? Would it make his dick grow? I'll give you got on some wild silver back Mark Coleman in 1996 type steroids.

Speaker 2:          02:21:48       You know, so some top of the fucking food chain, Alexander Karelin type shit. Cause when you did grow up, you're like, it would, I think it would grow. Your balls are going to shrivel up. You raise it, but you take is going to be balls. Your ball's going to have to step away from the game. They're not doing the job. You know, it's like what if you have a four cylinder engine and your race car and someone comes along and say, listen, we've got one or two choices. We can either take out this bitch ass four cylinder and put in this ls seven six point whatever leader, motherfucker, you fire breathing dragon per engine. Or you can keep up with your bullshit fuel economy in that Shitty Putt Putt. What are we going to do? We're here to win races. While you take that crazy, you know, Mark Carr, Haga engine 2001, you know mark the smashing machines at his peak.

Speaker 2:          02:22:42       They take some of that stuff. You know what? I don't know if your Dick grows longer. I think it might get fat or might get bigger too. I mean just the girls click gets bigger. How does this Dustin Jacoby next, is that next? Oh, that's a good fun. That's comin event. Beautiful. Beautiful product. Yeah. He's a tough kid, man. UFC too, right? Yes he did. Tough kid. Um, I wonder, I w I think genetic engineering is going to be where it's all at. That's what's going to, we'll get there and pretty soon the rosy, we walk around with Dicks to try to asses big Dicks, giant deck, seek noses. I just have this bit about big Dick Pills that have big dick pills. Really worked. It would take about 30 minutes for the first guy to die of an overdose. And then I go, cause no one's going to take one.

Speaker 2:          02:23:29       Oh, big Dick pills work it. Take one makes my Dick groat. What if I take all of them, puts out like how much do I take before I die? And I'll take one less than that. Yeah. This fucking party rolling. When I was like that, there's a Jacoby fighting that guy that we just saw that one earlier right there. Jacoby is one of the guys are beating him. The guy that we saw earlier that a knocked out Bang Bang on buyers are going to be done. Yeah. And Wayne parents, bad mother fucker. He's very good. Super Athletic. Real quick. Real sneaky man. Really, really good athlete. Good boxer too. He's a good boxer. Before he, uh, got into kickboxing. He's a real good athlete too. There's a lot of real good guys at high level in this. So I mean you're, you're, you know, a shilling. I wonder how it works with glory.

Speaker 2:          02:24:14       Like are they contracted to Gloria or they can't find anywhere else is, but is it the, you know, the bell, Tor and Gloria are friendly, but can he fight elsewhere? Can he fight over in Japan or, I don't know how it was contrary to how those contracts are. I don't know. They have glass. Be Tough. Paul Daley too though that Paul Daley, he's in both belter and like I said, that makes sense for those guys. It's just whatever it is. For whatever reason, Bella [inaudible] has been around for a long time now. Okay. It's been around for several years and for whatever fucking reason, it just has not caught on the way the UFC caught on in like the early 2000. Never. Well, that doesn't make sense to me. They don't, they don't have the stars don't have the depth. They don't have the production, but they have don't have the money.

Speaker 2:          02:24:57       Right. They have Viacom money. Crazy money. Why doesn't Viacom's say, look, we can either have this middling product where we're always going to have like a good guys like Phil Davis and Tito Ortiz and you know, uh, Sheila Manco and good fighters. Or we can go balls out and we can get the really good guys like cool. Like anybody, anybody that's in contract negotiations. Chad Mendez was talking to them when Chad Mendez had, you know, his contract is about to come up. You don't think that he got offers? I don't know what his deal was and I don't think he was even thinking about going, but you don't think that rampage went over there? You know rampages in it will lawsuit right now where he's got to figure out where he's going to fight again if he is ever going to fight again. The UFC said they would let them go.

Speaker 2:          02:25:39       They said, yeah. They said, look, we understand that you're in this big lawsuit with Viacom and Viacom's threatened to sue the UFC, said, we'll let you go. You could. You could go and fight for them and yeah, it was cool for them to do that. I think they're offering to settle [inaudible] Viacom's offering to settle. They want, because they did violate his contract. It did 100% he did fight Fabio Maldonado afterwards. The judge cleared him to fight. So I don't know what the specifics of the case was, but is the last that I read was that you're looking at, you're looking at a 10 year investment where we're going to have to get these young guys from from the UFT and then we're going to have to recruit the younger guys who come up cause guys come up through the ranks, right? Like Phil Davis or the ultimate fighter came up for the ultimate fighter.

Speaker 2:          02:26:20       A bunch of guys. Did they have to figure out kind of their feeder system because right now all they're doing is biting off the UFC. Really? Let's be really, yeah, they're putting on B level c level shows that the UFC put it on. T five, six years ago, Phil Dave's kind of the first guy who's in his prime who went there, you know. But Phil, Dave's isn't a knockout artist. I love Phil. Phil Davis just knocked out, uh, what's his face? Um, um, uh, hold, hold the Karma Karma come home. [inaudible] very good fighter. And Davis beat the shit out. I knocked him out. He looked nasty. No Davis fuck those dudes up. It's like a, he turned a corner, you know, and like did he turn to corner? Is He fighting lesser competition? Both. I think both the, I agree. I think Davis is getting better and I think Dave says in his prime and he's, he's going to run that show for a very, very long time.

Speaker 2:          02:27:08       I was super impressed when he beat Glover. I was like, wow, that is a big victory. But I think Glover had a shit camp. I really did feel big victory though. Whatever, whatever miscues Glover makes. That's a huge Vic hundred percent. But um, I was disappointed when he lost a baiter. But then when you see the way Bader beat Rashad, you're like, look, Bader need, you need to consider Bader the way he is right now. Don't consider how Bader got knocked out by Glover or bater that got knocked up. I'm a cheetah five in a row. He's won five in a row and look fucking real good. But guess what's next for him though? You're a mother fucker and Anthony Johnson. Yeah. Couldn't be worst matchup. Is that happening? Because I'm bill asked for. I think that's what's next for him cause what are you going to do?

Speaker 2:          02:27:46       You're going to sit out and wait for John and DC to fight. Who knows how long that's going to be. They're going to make you fight rumble, terrifying, rumbles, terrifying and I can't think of worst matchup for Beta and I love Beta, but if I, if it, if I'm being, I'm like God, if I'm Beta, I'd rather fight Jon Jones then rub. I can't think of a worst matchup for him. There's some interesting fights at two oh five real interesting. Real interesting. I was really surprised how well he shot were shot down. I was really surprised. I was like, wow, Bader has really turned a corner. He's really a fight to say that. Well it's just because your shot had two years layoff, but Beta look real

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       good. I'm only basing it on how good bait or looked. He looked real good. He looked real smoothly to stand up. He's getting way better. His Jab is nasty man. The was really getting up a lot of the other aspects of a striking because he's developed a rhythm with his jab where his jab become so fluid and efficient that he can like kind of half out there. He can half it and then pop you with it. He's landing it in like a more diverse way than he ever did before. He has more proficiency, like his proficiency with his jam. I agree. He looks great. Wayne Co main event. Wayne Barrett versus Dustin Jacoby. Um, he paid her. Does look great. I think it's tough to, it's tough. The base it off the Rashad fight. I agree with you. I agree with you. That was a real tough fight for Rashad.

Speaker 1:          02:29:07       I think Rashad rubbed on it better to have a fight with someone who wasn't a member. Yeah. But think about Bateman. It think what Betas come from marijuana. He lost a fucking Tito Ortiz and it's two in a row. Very lost. A Tito Ortiz Maritio teasers like hit him and he's like, he hit him and then he chokes them. Edit them. Yeah. Yeah. But that motherfucker man, because Ortiz, if he's on and he catches you, he's still Tito Ortiz, Tito Ortiz. Gotta remember he was at one point in time, the motherfucker that is put down in there until, I mean not really because chuck was always out there. We always knew that chuck was out there, but for before he fought chuck, when you think of what he did, Evan Tanner and you think of like the beat downs he put on Kevin and Ken shamrock. Yeah man. Like he's still cute.

Speaker 1:          02:29:51       The wage. He was like one of the first guys never use a one arm guillotine. He a choked out. Yuki Kondo in Japan. Remember that? Well, think about, um, such a pan. I think it was, well, think about bait or though that he was too lots of the road and just lost to Tito Ortiz. He was like on the chopping block, man. I remember just being like, damn, really Beta. Well that dude, just boom. Dustin Jacoby is going after Wayne Barrett is a dangerous fight for Jacoby because Barrett has fought more elite competition. Like he's fought Joe Schilling beat Joe Schilling once. Lost Joe Schilling in the last fight. Not Joe Schilling down like he's, he's dangerous. And Jacoby is a, I forget the Brazilian cat that he got knocked out by dude. I say mcnichols arena. That arena has been shut down for literally 15 years. That's Magnus Urena. Magnus mcnichols is old school where you'll see like two and three happened to, this is a good fight. Wayne Barrett. He slick man. Look at that. Oops. Not here. Oh yeah. Jacoby's like super aggressive too. I forget that dude that he fought this bad ass Brazilian cat put was Dustin Jacoby's record bad ass dude who caught him with a left hook. Do it's tough cause Jacoby came to the UFC and just struggled. Right? Because you can't fight like this well off, have to get off like this. It's, it's, it's a different style. Fighting with the small gloves, that's for sure. How did he lose to, that's MMA. MMA The wall.

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       That's all MMA. See you fine. Um, destined. Jacoby's a kickboxing career. Um, we could duck under coe. He slicky duck under the looping right hand. Yeah. It's just, um, the, the, the big gloves thing. The defense is so much different. Oh, 100%. And that's what happened. A shilling and shilling his last fight, he got caught with that superman punch by that dude. That was bad. Who was ruthless shit happens. But those punches, they come down on angles. There is Dan. That stretch from 13 to 15 was tough. Why can't I read that script? Make that Casey Green Burials Perera Alex Berrera. Yeah, it was pretty last diaper. Yeah, that's who it was. It was Pereira. Um, demis fought all over. Yeah, you got a d. It's a totally different style of defense when you using the small gloves, the big loves give you so much more leeway to catching punches and the punches themselves are bigger.

Speaker 2:          02:32:20       That gloves are bigger so the punches are coming at you. It's a larger object coming at you and you have a larger object to catch that larger object and all that shit is shrunk and considerably when you put those MMA gloves to the Max Day, it'd be like these guys fighting with their hand wraps on. It's completely different game. What do you think about the idea of no gloves? I won't work. No. Oh, I'm, if you hate money and ratings, it'll work. You know what I'm saying? Like, like it's rough. It's rough enough now being mainstream, you know, I don't think we're still mainstream. I think we're still working on that with the top sports. You take gloves off and these dudes are bare knuckle fucking dudes up. Yeah, it makes sense to us. Right. It makes sense that the educated people, but I mean made America sees that shit.

Speaker 2:          02:33:06       General People like what the hell? This is so barbaric. Right. That's the only thing. Yeah, maybe. I don't know man. I mean, why is it barbaric to punch in the face and not barbaric to knee in the face. I'll come show I'm with you 100% take the gloves off. It's safer. It is. It is. I'm with you. However, marketing wise, good luck selling that. They're like, hold up. We're going back to the Kimbo slice backyard brawl days thought we were moving forward. Well you would have a lot of dudes breaking their hands too. That'd be a real problem. It'd be a real problem for like longevity of your career and people think I'm exaggerating. Listen, take away the hand wraps. Take away the wrist wraps. No risk wraps. Cause I think one of the flaws of the human hand and wait for punching is the wrist.

Speaker 2:          02:33:51       It's hard. Like you have to have Rick real discipline to punch hard and you have to practice hitting things bare knuckle to really develop that rigidity in your wrist when you deliver the, the impact of a punch. Because most people when they hit things, their wristbands back twist sideways. Most people don't know. They wind up breaking their hands. They hit with the knuckles and the outside. Well that's why boss would open hand slap pitches. Well the is doing that now. He was, he was fighting Pancrase so it's the only way you could fight. He figured out that was the rules of Pancrase. Yeah. Also did it though when they had gloves, he used open hand. Shit ruined when they had gloves. He did that. Yeah. He, he would throw throws hooks with an open hand. He said. Interesting. Yeah. Huh. Well, that's one of the reasons why probably transferred so easily to pancreas.

Speaker 2:          02:34:34       Damn. It was a good fight. You know, one of the things that boss figured out how to do in some weird way, he figured out how to pull his hand back way far. So when he was hitting guys, he was hitting him like a punch with the palm. Yeah, with the base of the palm, like right where it reaches a like where the, the palm is, um, meets the wrist joint. He would pose hands so far back, like unnaturally far, if you watch his fights, it's kind of weird how far his hand was like the first freak athlete to get the, I mean, he was a freak athlete man who's the first elite striker in MMA, in my opinion, him and most Smith. But he was probably the first cars with moe. He really didn't know any grappling to speak of when we first started fighting and Pancrase he, you know, he really had to learn more grappling before we could see like an extreme fighting.

Speaker 2:          02:35:22       You've got to see what his kickbox. It was really like when you act out Culann Soviet era, that's when everybody was like, Oh shit, like this is some next level shit. And then when he came over to the UFC and beat Mark Coleman and won the title, people are like, oh, okay, this is what a kickbox are really low. It's like a world class. Kickboxer boss said he taught himself Jujitsu. That's madness. Crazy. Right? Then you'd watch videos and teach himself had a training partner, just humans trading partner with learning. Hey, I tried this on you. How crazy is that? I believe it. Awesome bosses. Crazy bitch. Savage hit some crazy ideas about conditioning too. He goes, when are we kicked the bag? I would go 100% and how long can I do? 30 30 seconds. 100% well tomorrow I'll do 40 seconds and then I do two minutes and then Tracy do to build it up so that he could get to like whatever the round was.

Speaker 2:          02:36:11       It was just sprint God the different time back then. Well they didn't, you know. Now people do Tabata. When you do a elliptical and you do like a intervals like Tabata intervals, we do what is the, is like 20 seconds, 10 seconds off the typical Tabata. What I do when I do a sprint, like if I'm in a hotel and I have a nothing but elliptical machine at the gym, I'll do sprints on the elliptical machine while crank it up. So like whatever, really high level and I'll do 30 minutes of thunder, I call it, or 30 seconds of thunder. I was like 30 minutes now god Damn, 30 seconds. Well, 30 minutes for the whole workout, but for the thunder it's 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off. That's, it gives me something to do and like those 30 seconds off like, oh, I know it's common.

Speaker 2:          02:37:04       I know it's common. Here comes up fucking 20 minutes. I think it's a part of the way to do it because you're not so focused on the overall time. Me and my folks on 30 30 30 30 30 it also gets you used to being completely exerted. It's a great way to, to get a cardio workout. Um, piece. I'm like, what people think of like a hardcore workouts. You think of an air dine or maybe a, a versa climber. Like those you think of is like Hark averse climber. You can get the same kind of insane workout on an elliptical machine, hundred percent, but people associate elliptical with like, you know, you're watching the news going slow. When I use the elliptical machine, people look at me like something fucking wrong with you. I go hard in the paint on and I go fucking hard on the elliptical.

Speaker 2:          02:37:47       Now, hard in the paint, in the paint. What does that mean? Just like this mask authors. I like the pill hard in the motherfucking paint us round two or three rounds. Three damn. Dustin Jacoby. Uh, you don't, you don't how we're starting to see a trend where guys are sparring less and less because they realize the abuse and the gym that, uh, Rodriguez was saying how he only sparked three times I think in camp. Yeah. Yeah. Year. Um, I think Brian, Stan was saying that. Yeah. Well. We'll just see Jacoby trying to, we'll get Dustin Jacoby really taking it to a man. He looks great. He looks really improved too from the Pereira fight. I think a that knockout really, uh, taught him a lot about defense. He's looking great in this fight, man. Good leg kick right there. Barrett's thrown with the but look how like how easy it is to block punches with these God damned gloves.

Speaker 2:          02:38:40       It's such a different game. It's so different. Look at this John Wayne par when he does that cage. [inaudible] Todd, did they wear MMA gloves or do they wear gloves? Yeah, he has a fight coming up Friday. He's coming out here soon. He's fighting black dynamite. I liked them in um, in cage Moitai and he's out here fighting for the title San Diego in a, yeah, in lion fight. He's going to fight for the title. I liked that guy too. He's a good dude. Yeah. Really good dude. Funny. Yeah. I got to work out with him, man. He showed me some his and was that really interesting way of throwing punches? Like he throws everything hard. Like, even his jab is hard. He makes it count. Jab. He pulls back with his right hand. Oh Shit. Wayne Barrett went down. What happened?

Speaker 2:          02:39:26       Oh my God. So it's uh, he's, he was touching the back of his head like it was a bad strike and he's out of it. Oh, he's super out of it. That's it. Whoa. Dustin Jacoby knocked out. Wayne Barrett and Wayne Barrett is a, he was pointing to the back of his head. He pointed to the back of his head earlier in the fight too. Damn. Justin Jacoby. Congratulations. Good for you. Um, what was I just saying? A fucking John Van. John Wayne par. He throws punches like this. He pulls back on his right hand. This is how he throws a jab. He goes like that. She said, I've worked out with them for like an hour and a half. We did awesome. Yeah, it was really fun. He's a good dude. He's showed me a lot of cool shit to a lot of cool shit. Like the way he delivers is interesting too. Damn. That is legit as fuck. What does he point in the back of his head for the, you could see that again, that'd be one where you got hit. He was getting battered before he got dropped there. I mean that was not just that one shot either. What happened?

Speaker 2:          02:40:27       Oh, they went to a commercial, so I wanted to see that knocked down again. That's another thing. I don't Miss Boxing. No. Any box and I'll watch fucking all of, we have a a thing, right? Can we rewind that for a second? I just want to see that knocked down again. It'd be nice. I forgot we have the DVR up in this bitch. Yeah, there it is. Not right before that, Jamie. Right before that. Oh, right before there we go. This is the money and here we go. Boom. On the temple. But when that's good chin back as a hundred percent good. That's the side of the head. Oh, that'd be the temple. Let's say that's the back of the head. Let me see that again. You come from the home and left. Took Bam. No, no chance to make it slow. Jamie and legal. Whoa. Hold on. Hold on, but make it go slow. That's a fucking temple dude. Watch it. That would be bad. Hold on. Make it slow. Isn't there a slow button? There's a slow mo thing. You press like a pause and then I dunno. Double Pie. I think pause and then a fast forward.

Speaker 4:          02:41:27       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:41:28       Oh, let me see that thing. Isn't there like a small way you can do it slow Mo. Pretty sure the rest. What does this no network connection cancel. Hold on. Oh he say it's back to what happened here Jamie. Where am precedents to, where's the receiver? It's in there. Well how does it work? Well it's not, it's not reacting. Think got to hit cancel on that thing for sure. Back in the head. But it's legal. You know what I'm saying? It's in transition. Okay, so it's legal.

Speaker 4:          02:42:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:42:02       Um, take a look at it better. That first view, lets get a view of it in real time first. Here it is right here. This is where you can see it. Back to that. Boom. Bam. See to me it looks like the side of the head. Definitely. He's grabbing this. He's grabbing pesticide the head and no, that's not where he's grabbing and he's grabbing like his temple. How do I make this thing go slow? Let me see if I can do this.

Speaker 4:          02:42:27       I think there's a way.

Speaker 2:          02:42:30       Yeah, here it is. Oh, here we go. Okay. Okay. I get the old crazy eyes on him. Okay. Ready? Here we go. It was Dustin Jacoby. Moving in. Check it.

Speaker 4:          02:42:46       Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:42:46       Mad pressure budget. Coby to good defense. Good defense here. Bear tried to swing that right hook around left to Colby. Bank catches him here. 100% clean. That side of the head side of the head, which is legit, right? Correct. Okay. Let's see. We get a good view of it here and it really relying on that right hand. Boom, kind of Cassie if grazes that, but that ones gets blocked. That wouldn't gets blocked. So now he's coming over again. Bear it is or a Jacoby has misses that left and now here we go. It goes to the back of the head to look at that. Come on son. Look where he's standing. That's basically the back of look where he's standing there standing, staring at each other. Homeboy moves though he moves his bear, turns his head sideways and he hits them right in the temple bra.

Speaker 2:          02:43:40       That's not in the template right here. If we look at him, it's not the bat not touching right there. He's not touch as he has a hook for an arm. There's no fucking way that's hitting the bag. No, look at it right there. It's bouncing off the side of his head and you see the fist appear behind his head. One more time. One more time. Let's watch it again. Watch it again. Boom. That's one. And there's the right hook misses, and there's the left hook over the top and here cubs. Here it comes. Look, they're standing right at each other and the punch comes, eh. Watch. When the companies look at that, that's not touching them and correct. Incorrect. This is a straight punch, right? It lands on the side of his head and then a glances off the side of his head and you see the fist behind the head, you'll fit is not no fucking chance.

Speaker 2:          02:44:32       There's not hitting the back of his head that is hitting the side of his head and you're seeing the punching glove. It's like, here Joe look like, yeah, yeah, that's legal dude. I'm not, it's illegal. But I think, I think that's legal. The same back of the head. That's the side of the head will will. It's the side of the head. You got to punch me and I move like this and you end up hitting side and back of the head that's, he's not hitting the back of the head. So he didn't touch the back of his head of his head. No. Touch side and back. I don't know, man. Boom to me looks like right behind the ear, which is totally legit. The back of the head to me is a rabbit ponch. That's where the base of his neck neat meets the face.

Speaker 2:          02:45:11       The head. That's the back of the year. That's legal. That's not, that's does. No, I think you're changing the game. No, no, no. That's fine, bro. It's changing again. Yeah, but it's not booming. It's legal. That's kind of legal. Yeah, it's totally legal. Yeah, I agree. Or maybe I misunderstood. Maybe I misunderstood. I thought you were saying communication here. That's all it is. That's pretty slick though. It's a big win for Jacoby, Matt. Real big win. Oh Shit. Artem leavened top of the heap. He's out though. Huh? Well he's out for this fight. You know, you look at that guy, you look at his body and you're like, it looks a lot like Ari Shaffir his body. How's that guy? Such a bad ass, you know man. If number four, Huh? Well he's been fucked up by Joe showing any sense. How is he so highly ranked?

Speaker 2:          02:45:59       Well, Joe's too though. Awesome. Well Joe Schilling hasn't really a lost in glory other than the decision loss to a Simon Marcus or did that wasn't in glory. The decision last to Artem leaven a beat Artem 11 by decision too. And then the decision loss to Wayne Barrett. Those are the fights that he lost in glory. So shilling getting paid bank to compete in MMA for sure. Stick with kickbox. I agree. What the fuck are you doing? I think he just doesn't want to back off from a challenge and he wants to be the best at everything he does. And that's how he got to be such a bad ass. Kickbox I agree, but be a bad ass. Kickboxer it'll be an average MMA fighter. Well it's just really hard to do everything, man. It's really hard. It's really fun to not do everything. It's not possible. It's really not.

Speaker 2:          02:46:44       It's a, it's a crazy game man. The game of trying to be the baddest motherfucker and two disciplines. That is a crazy, crazy game cause they got, the guys he's fighting aren't focusing on their off time grappling and wrestling. They're getting better at striking 100% that's what it's tough. Like when I see that I love, I love Joe, she'll, and I see a friend of yours is front of mind and I support him, but when I see him do I have a man, I'm like, what the fuck you doing? Well you know what? He knocked out Melvin Manhoef in MMA, but he was fighting a guy, Melvin Manhoef, that even though we had a lot of success in MMA, knocked out Mark Hunt, he's a guy who's been knocked out a gang at times. Hahnemann, knocked out by Robbie Lawler and one of the most horrific knockouts you've ever seen your life.

Speaker 2:          02:47:26       It was winning that fight too. It was, if you remember Robbie Lawler uncorked a nuke from and his lights went out and he goes flat to his back so bad. And Robbie comes down on him when he's out and oh, bismuth blood all over his mouth, his blood coming out of his mouth, and he busted his fucking limp open. I think that, uh, you know, Joseph's just got that in him. He just wants to be a bad motherfucker at everything he does, which is why I became so good at kickboxing. But I think there's, there's wisdom in your words. He's one of the best kick boxers on the planet earth without a doubt. Hands Down, hands down, one of the best on planet earth. But I think capsule, MMA fighter, but losing the way he lost that Japanese cat, that half Japanese dude that he lost to, who was that guy's name?

Speaker 2:          02:48:14       Where you got Superman Punch? Yeah. That guy is a beast, man. That guy's really good. He's no joke. He's good though. The his, his striking is nasty. That fucking punch was nasty. No matter how you slice. Super Nasty. I Isd, I'm just saying it's still Bella tour. It is. But that guy was the only fought bell toward that one time. I mean, that guy could have easily been in the UFC and get good at Dow. Fuck. Ah. Kobiashi dude. Never know. Yeah. Yeah. So I kind of get his ass up and uh, we got 10 minutes left before we go to three hours. So, um, we're gonna take a little break here folks, and we're going to have a very short part to the sh the part two will be so God damn short, it's 10. What is it? Nine 15 now actually, we'll probably go to 10 o'clock.

Speaker 2:          02:49:02       We'll make part two like, um, 45 minutes. We'll go to 10 o'clock. So, uh, we're going to get the fuck outta here. Now, the end of this podcast has come. If you're a annoyed by this, listen, this is just how these things go. Whatever for sure. Don't, don't download part too, because for sure we just going to be talking about, uh, our friend Joe Schilling. Well, I love that dude. So, uh, that's why we're here. That's why this is the first Spike TV glory event we've ever done. A fight companion, 400% for Joe Schilling. This is what this is for moral Renelle. Okay. Shied with skeletor. We'll be right back, right back.
