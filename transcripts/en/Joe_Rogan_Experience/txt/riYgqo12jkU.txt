We had a just disaster trying to order from the UFC TV app and then so we had to go through your direct TV and then we went to direct TV and then we had to call in and they couldn't talk to a person. I had to enter in shit, so I had a check. Find my fucking account number online. We all panicked. The debit. We panicked a little bit but we're here. Eddie Bravo's here. Ladies and gentlemen. Hello. How are you doing Brian? Motherfucker Collins here. So everybody hell, are you good to be a good to be here? Brian bought wine. That could be a good or a bad decision. We're gone California first then we're going to go a little Italy for my boy at via Veneto courtesy. Okay. Fuck Riccio he's giving shout outs already.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       We just started, he gave me some great one. Yancy Madeiros one already. We didn't even get a chance to watch the fight cause it. We just just got it live and printed motherfucking job. What is going on with that shirt? You are in like a 1980s he sure is movie. Oh I'm glad you mentioned that Michael J. Fox. Well you look like a dude who's in one of those breaking movie. Yeah, everybody should have a Bandana. Usually a tough guy with a switchblade in an eighties movie. That's what you should do. A poor Mexican chicks wear jeans of that material that they do do that swap in right now cause that's just artificially stretched in the extra e kids are wearing it. They just showed shogun. Did you, have you seen the UFC light heavyweight rankings? Yeah, he's like three. It's kind of your Skype for four.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       It's really crazy. They're going to have that owes Demir Dude, he's going to fight Jimi Manoa. Oh, you're talking about pound for pound champion. He's had two fights in the UFC and he's like number three now. Weird light heavyweights. The weirdest division. Jones out. Kill it with John Jones out and Gustafson obviously just rose to the top of the heap. How good did he look? God Damn. Wash that fight. Which one? Gustafson and to share. I missed that whole EOC. It was she, I was on my way back down to cost of sin was a Ninja. It'd be tough to beat man. Dude. He was so on point. It was one of the best performances of his entire career. It was incredible. Those upper cuts. Oh my God. Accuracy that heard c was insane. I heard the fight companion, but I didn't actually watch it happen. Dude. He was amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:02:29       Gustafson was as good as he's APP. I don't think he's ever looked better. He's good. He's gonna be a handful to beat for John NDC. Yeah, he's, he's coming into his own, you know, he's 30 years old and fighting for a long time. He said tough fights with John. Tough fight with DC. He got beat up by rumble, you know, and he's took a long time off, came back and look better than he's ever lived. Has Knee, wasn't he for a second? They're thinking about retiring in his hometown. Just top on. I bet you he's the light heavyweight champ by the end of the year. He could be, do you think he

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       beats John John's? Yup. Wow. Huh? Who knows. Cause your brain guy, he's the old shiny comes back. We don't even know what John's going to come back looking like. The tide takes that much time off and you know he's, who knows either he's going to come back better than ever. Like Rory Macdonald looked and Bella tour. Roy just needed rest though. He's never looked like, you know like Roy just need Resi rusted John. He's a little cocoa, you know, horror. Jeez. Hey pro button ups and blazers talking about God, I don't meet that. I don't like that job. That's the OSP, John. Those bullshit. You want that. You want to relax John and just doesn't devil may care. I want the two day training camp. John, I wanted John to takes a flying knee for his first opening movie going to show. Yes, he's 22 yes, Britain does crazy elbows.

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       How about him? Like bragging that he beat DC hi coke a week before. I don't think the best line of all time. Best Line of all time. His career's not going to be affected by that. No. Right now we are accepted. He's, oh he's the bad pile. The flow. He's the bad guy. He comes clean. Yeah. Be that guy fucking love that. It's always better if you come clean period, because you can smell fakeness from a mile away would be turns into Conner McGregor, but on Coke beat that guy. I just think if you, if you're, if you're caught up in the demon in the demons and if you're completely honest about it, Americans love you. They forgive the Shit Outta you. Charlie's Shit fucked up again. Exactly. Charlie Sheen is like the best example that ever. Well who the fuck ever admitted to doing crack? Yeah, like on a regular basis and talking about how he does it.

Speaker 2:          00:04:42       I, that's how I do it. That's how we roll and then he goes on, it gets a TV deal for $900 million. You're Robert Downey jr too. Did he got the West TV? Yeah, but he went to jail. He got cuffs function. What's that raw iron man. It was fucking, he shoes. Really? He's Robert Downey jr it seemed when I was growing up was in the news. You always saw him in court for something, right? Robert Downey Jr was always asking him for forgiveness for being awesome. And then the judge Robert Downey Jr is in court today. He still mixing humongous Ironman. Yeah, we forgive drug problems easily. It's when he got back he stuck movie start with dudes who are drunks like an ex cop and he gave up on life and he's just a loser. He doesn't care about anybody. Throws a pizza in a blender.

Speaker 2:          00:05:37       We root for Escobar. When you watch, when you watch narcos aren't you kind of pulling forward? You really want him to pull it out and that's when you know somebody did their job as a storyteller if you're at like, it's like that's why science, the lance was so genius because you liked him and wanted him to be free cause you were like, you know what he does, he eat people but he wouldn't eat me. Not only did everybody route for Tony Montana, but what when I always, anytime I would see that movie another time I was hoping there would be some kind of alternate ending.

Speaker 2:          00:06:11       I would always just leave town to go back to your house. Do you remember when, uh, we will, uh, what's his face? Is Larry David's show curb your enthusiasm? Yes. Hear that crazy. I had killer guy and he played, he played in Scarface over his house. 24, seven [inaudible] scarf. He is 24, seven in his crib and Rob Davis had Scarface. Man. Scarface is a funny movie and I know they're remaking it. It's probably the first movie ever. Would like an anti hero. Was that the first one? Well No, not the first one. The first big one. But like Clint Eastwood movies are kind of like that, right? He wasn't, yeah. Clinics. What? It was like the high plains drifter. He was kind of a Ne'er do well, came back, but he would do good things. You wouldn't do shitty shit is never a douchebag. But the guy came back to life though.

Speaker 2:          00:07:06       The Godfather was, that was a, yeah, that was, which was the one where he came back to life, was it high plains? He knows high plains drifter. He came, they beat him and whipped him to death and he came back to life control a hitman and he came back. Well, I don't know that that was the case, but I know that when high plains or did he take your shirt off and he's got all these bullet marks and the guy goes, but you're dead. We did meet him once and he's supposed to be like a ghost came back and killed everybody maybe to see if that's the case. Do you mean you know he's sure that was high plains drifter storyline was that he was like, he came back from the dead. It was a different person. Different. I'm pretty sure I love that movie.

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       I only know Clint Eastwood from his current movies. That was always old. She never saw the outlaw Josey Wales over shit. That movie stands the test of time. Oh, I'm young. I'm not the best clinics would moving high plan. I mean, uh, uh, I love jazz. Who else? Man? It's pretty close though. It doesn't matter. It cannot come out before our time. Honestly it was like in 1970 or something like that. If it came out now it would, it would still killed. I don't know too much about Clint Eastwood. I wasn't really into Westerns, but I know there's a bunch you hear Joey talking about and stuff. I would be interested in and seeing a documentary based on his career started. It started with the good, the bad and the ugly. It was the first I walk. Yeah. And then how many did he make after he made so many? And here's the most of them in Italy and more than that sheet what? But here's the door call spaghetti westerns because they were doing them in Italy because they would, they'd film in Italy and pretend they were in New Mexico and she had two of the most controversial moments in movie history. Clint Eastwood one is he rapes a woman. He straight up rapes are in a barn. He just, he just rips a girl and he's a hero. He's a hero. And then the second movie was that Hawaiians

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       drifter to, nope, it was at that point with no Douche bag in the movie. What movie? It was just him as he was. He was just a man. Just come that he raped a girl, she and then she falls in love with and then she calls them loving them later. Okay, how about this? Ready? What is this called? Then he can look past, look at this through they're making them do something to do is they always check my toenails. If you've got to trim your toenails, do with a fucking toenail clipper and then file that shit down. John. Mike Winkeljohn doesn't have a fucking eyeball because of that. That's not oh shit. True. That is something very serious and should have been taken care of a long time ago. If I was fighting this guy and I saw that he was doing that to his toenails right before a fight with his fingers, I'd be like, fuck no.

Speaker 3:          00:09:36       He's using a clipper. He's, he's, it is up to the point. He sit down, it's a file it down sharply, just trimming it and then on top of it he's going to do the other toe to the reps going to do it. Now imagine if he'd go to fucking refaced trim and his toenails. Man, he's serious. This is crazy. He's very religious. They should, but they should be polished. You should sand those fuckers down. I agree with condoms all the time. Many condoms on about it. They're really, look fingernails. Fuck People's eyeballs up. You know, that's a big part of what's going on with these IPOs. It's not just a blunt object. It's a blunt object with a fucking hard edge to it. [inaudible] he goes, well, he got poked in the US, all three Gustafson and then he goes, what? They go, can you see goes? No, but I will keep fighting the old cool. They'll let them fight off. So I'm glad that it stopped the fight and he goes, it wouldn't matter though. He had my time and use faster, but you know he had everything. Well, if he couldn't see out of one eye, that was, he was getting beat up before that though. But he did say he goes it, it wouldn't matter. What does it say? Jeremy?

Speaker 4:          00:10:36       I plains drifter had their rape and I can't quite tell if this is the one,

Speaker 3:          00:10:40       how did the guys say? Yeah, that was the one of the reasons why he got away with it because he was this guy coming back from the dead. Well, what is the, what is the, what's the premise?

Speaker 4:          00:10:51       So is that, uh, this at the beginning of attractive towns, woman deliberately bumps into him in the street and Oxys to golf?

Speaker 3:          00:10:58       No, no, no, no. I don't mean the premise of the rape. I mean, the premise of the movie, I, it doesn't really have, it's a long plot here. Okay. Five paragraphs is insanely controversial. He May, there's a girl, she's about eight, maybe younger. She saves him from a, he's a union soldier. She saves him from the confederate soldiers. He saves life. She says, no, he's not here. And he looks at her and cause he said, look, he turns and kisses her on the lips for about five seconds. How about that? Oh yeah. More than that. It's, it's like, you're like what? I mean, they've got to witness on shit. Yeah. But by the way, no, no. It was a different movie and he in this, he wasn't, you knew he wasn't like a pedophile. He was just so happy that his life had been spared that you could never get away with that.

Speaker 3:          00:11:43       I probably shouldn't it movies, but you know, the 70s really crazy. It's like how much culture has changed since 1970 yup. How much humans have changed? It's true. I feel like Paulo here could rave or go and get away with in the movies. I mean, he is a dime pays and good luck on this. Good fight before. No, it was a monster. Yeah, he's very good. He's, he's part pronounce his last name. That's going to be tough. You're asking the wrong gentleman here. He's built like a, like a speech. Congratulations. What is a d? Jamie? See if you can find the pronunciation of his name, what we'll hear it from Brian Stann. There's things that you can do anymore nowadays, but there's things now that you couldn't do back then. Like, Shit seems to be slipping into TV every now and then and maybe a fuck after 10.

Speaker 3:          00:12:29       There's no, they're starting to look at this. Did you see the lanes? They were talking shit that to separate them. Wow. Can I ask you guys a question? Uh, who were in the know, I know that you saw that is very strict, but if you're in Brazil, are you, uh, are, is there literally just asked him a shingle analysis? Let's say his name. Let's see. What do you think of? His name is Gina. Gina, Gina, Gina, Gina, and then his name is Olu la. My mind, I think it's been both. I think he's from Nigeria. That's my guess. I think. Yeah, let's hear it. Let's hear it. Give me some volume. It'd be hilarious. Flux and stuff. Oh, that's here. I can't hear my, here we go. Let's hear the names a little louder.

Speaker 5:          00:13:22       Just all

Speaker 3:          00:13:38       Boshea bamboo. Bamboo shade. Okay. Now listen to this

Speaker 5:          00:13:46       great fights. That means drunk, drunk chick or little drunk dude. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:14:03       For a cheap drunk because I bet you this fight doesn't get out of the first round, Jovan. For Real. I don't think so. The way the homeboy fights, how much volume can we have and still really what happens? I mean the sound would get in the, in the feed. Oh, okay. Right. Then we get pulled on to June's this Goddamn Youtube, youtube bunch of your hazers. Somebody's exposed to swinging. He said somebody is explosive. Yeah, because he's black. I said somebody, Bro, don't ever put words in my mouth and we'll he the black. I didn't do anything but wow, he's explosive. I didn't say that. That was a stereotype of Mexicans. When you're watching two guys fight like this, when you're watching two fight like this, there's so

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       tense. You know these guys are like, when you have a bunch of bad blood between two guys like you, you can almost like see it in how like wound up and pulled back. They are. They also don't have a lot of experience though either Joe. Like it's only homeboys second fight. She's kept up, they cut the shit out of his back. Yup. Does that work? Brian? What is it? What's going on? On my personally, don't believe it was on my knee. That worked. How did it work? What did it do it I had all like this bad blood in there. That wasn't a bad circulating and it literally got it out. It was like dark. The healer. That might be some bullshit. I call it placebo. Wait a minute. You mean it got it out? How does it get it out? It leaped. They poke holes in your name and put the suction.

Speaker 1:          00:15:32       It sucks. The, Oh, they cite the stagnant blood. Yo, look at this high back mount. He's getting a little sloppy there. You just go a little too wild. Yeah, but he's, he's attacking [inaudible]. We just barely missed that. Left to her. You can't lose guys. He's getting loose jacked. They are both six fellow you see on the beach, uh, shed the black fellow, the Brazilian. They both look like beach boys. A couple of peach, couple of beach bullies. I was talking about the Brazilian character though. He looks like some dude coming out of the water with a speedo on for Dior. Super uncomfortable about being on the beach with my shirt off. I go and run my Keto ass away.

Speaker 1:          00:16:12       I don't think he's a kid. I just think he's a nice side light kick. Great kick bamboo shit. Bomb Boucher is those John Joan legs. These things are dangerous. He's very, very stiff for this upper [inaudible]. We just get head kicked. He throws back shots and he's getting it. Bamboos it looks a little tired guys. Yeah. We're only two minutes in. Right? That's being all tight and wound up. I mean these guys got to catch their second wind and I see him pacing moving like at like nothing smooth. It's all fucking moving. A lot of looking to spin from him a couple of times. Both Guy Bam. Bamboozles Hey Glenn, I think he's going to lose when he throws it's big. It's just waits for a shot. Yep. He's not fucking around. He throws big shit. Yeah. It's whether or not he can sustain this style.

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       Dominick Cruz, he was like, he keeps switching stances. Oh, tag. Yeah. But I mean he's, he's obviously not as fluid as Donald. We know what that, that uh, he looked at us, glanced on heat though. They're both drawn. He, these guys are two dudes who don't really like each other. Oh, okay. Oh boy. Keeps looking at the blog or just as crazy as I can't tell. Oh, he's getting hurt while shit now. Yeah. Let's go board, cheat and go and get bamboozled. That's kind of smart. Oh Gosh. It was worried about the bodies when we have a body now with the punches.

Speaker 1:          00:17:49       Each stroke I shot his first fight he got, he's like Roberto Duran, Duran Duran and Dominick Cruz. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm talking about now the Brazilian. Oh God. God. God. God. Fight. Oh my God. The dread. Okay. Chance presenter. Rans boxing. It's like some of the best ever. God knows the body shots and that's who you are. Cesar Chavez right there. I couldn't drop that mark on his, the inside of his, neither on, on a Buddhist Sheena's knee and that's how I rolled the yard. But I seen that. I don't think that's the right way to say it. Well when chewing it like you're in France or something, but he didn't fuck. Yeah, I don't think books. Can you come and take your Brazilian accent for just a little while? He's going to wild for me. You know, but I'm going to try now. That guy's going to go look at, whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:19:01       Oh, oh. Control the posture. Posture Yourself. No, that guys, because I was in France because I was in Jamaica then I was in France, but I'm from Brazil. Control position. Come on, let him off posture. Very good posture. While the first round guys, he's having tried to walk Mullin, Dude, he's wobbling. He is fucking wobbling. Yeah, and he pointed, he came up to Jesus. He's just going to help them to be this dude's fucking oxygen to board she and had just poured it on, man. Are you going at this point? You know what? The black dudes and shape, yeah. Oh look. You can be built and still have endurance. I mean when Tim Kennedy with his at his best, he was always built like a tank. Never got tied to good endurance. Yeah. Was He shredded?

Speaker 1:          00:20:00       Look at those Strikeforce days, both of them shred city, but it's a fine line. It's a fine line. Like you get too much mass and not enough conditioning and you work too much on explosion in the fight and not enough on technique. Not Enough on pacing yourself. He's got a giant, she'll look at the Anthony Joshua. He's shred shredded city, 240 pounds to 40 and and came back, you know, got draw lines almost and then came back a track and the next round he got, he dropped Klitschko and then Klitschko dropped. That's when he dropped Klitschko twice in the final round. Upper cuts were caused by the way, I think it was a controversial stoppage. Boy, that guy's built. Holy Shit. Or Chino. It's the shoulders stacked. Yeah, he is man. Yeah, we'll just, we'll just toss it up. Just go ahead and let's definitely, I got amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:20:53       Know. That's what I'm saying. That's all minutes. Cause you know that golden snitches sniffing around these two like go fucking, he's young and he's got that mesomorphic structure. It doesn't look out of place. The hard place to hide. I know he doesn't look like no one would be facetious. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not accusing me double front shot anybody. [inaudible] tour on the car tonight. We're going to find out what the fuck is up. What is he going to look like? He tore it gets Nate Marquardt. Both of them have dabbled in iron man boulder. Yeah, I'm going to make a deal. They got to say, listen, I'm going to let my sister be for me.

Speaker 1:          00:21:36       He just kicked dropout bombs. Now it's going to be bad. Real bad. Eddie, what was that club? Not really tired and I didn't see the fight, but how did it go aboard? Chino put gets us. Eddie. What was that MMA fight that you posted on your Instagram or someone was gone for the heel hook be trippin. Oh Shit. What was that MMA fight you post on your Instagram today where someone was going for the heel hook. That was earlier today. I was in the and the other dude is beating the shit out of him while he's gone for the healer within the minute. Ran Out. Who won that fight? Matthew Lopez, the guy on top, the guy that's throwing bombs, Brazilian, I forget the Brazilians name. So the Brazilian was a cat that was going for the heel hook, Tim. That was a battle. Yeah, I put them right on 55th tough.

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       And he had, when he had the, he had it, he had it, but he held on and uh, Matthew Lopez used to dealing with heel hooks all the time. Great Wrestler and oppressive defense. Oh Man. Because he got the death's door. You got to death's door a couple of times. Yeah. Real good defect but damn hammer fist from hell. And that's the danger. And go to the leg locks and they work. They weren't, but some of the times you're going to get smashed. Jamie's got to play it. Look it up there. We get up there on the left. I mean this is like his clothes he got goddamn he'll hook is you're going to get this dude's jacket on it and Yanking on it and homeboy Matthew Lopez a bad motherfucker. Cause he was in pain here for sure. And he survived. Look at this thing. Top Kid, man. Oh yeah, right here.

Speaker 1:          00:23:01       They shouldn't allow a head kicks with the fuck. Fuck. You should be able to. It said, why could you kick someone in the head standing up and you can't kick someone to head on the ground? It makes zero sense. It's a viable move as spelling. If you want to say to the guy standing up, can't soccer kick the guy in the head or stopped him in the head? Okay. We can argue that because the cage, because he can't go, I can't go anywhere, but you can't argue that if they're in that position, the guy's going for a heel hook. They're both on the ground. You should absolutely be able to kick just like you could accidentally elbow to the head. You get punched in the head. Yeah. Why can't you kick to that? It makes zero sense. Zero upkick should be legal now you're percent, you're on your back. Might be too hard. It's too hard. It's too

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       hard. You can hit a guy with a wheel cake, but you can't up kick them when you're on your back and he's trying to close in on you. Fuck that. You should be able to go crazy. You should be able to, with the guys on his knees, you should be able to kick them to knees. One knee, you should be able to kick the shit out of him if you're on your back and I was in Singapore and I hung out with shots tree. The guy who owns evolve any owns one of scene or the guy who owns evolve owns one FC as well. Yeah, one championship, and I swear I've been doing, I've been to a thousand UFC investors. I never been to an event like this. Really? Dude, hey bro, you won championship as far as production goes and ha, fuck. Really doing English Clemente high level English commentary for them, it's the most incredible, it's like month, like this VIP section was just the way it was all set up.

Speaker 2:          00:24:38       Let's just, let's just spend, there's no budget. It was incredible. Every fighter, every finder that came out had its own music video and own show. They really go off. I'm promoting the each individual fighter. Each guy came out and he had his own music video, his own song cut up. Who's the big stars were there besides his ass to star over there. Ask them is a huge stuff dude, that guy has some of this. She's my way. So that's the reason I bring it up. Joe Is I was talking with them and I asked you a fucking goat cheese. I said he was going from close going back and forth on the rules like it cause they allowed soccer kicks initially. You see Brandon, very soccer kid. Eventually he said we got to pull them out. You know there was a couple really exactly know, but it's his decision.

Speaker 2:          00:25:38       He doesn't have a commission. He could do whatever he wants. So to him it's up to him and he decided to pull the, the soccer kicks but out we and all kicks on the ground and I said he included up kicks and he goes, well technically yes, but he thought about it for a second or maybe he allowed him, maybe I'm a little confused but as to what he said. But he agreed at the end of the conversation that upkick should be legal. I mean you're on your back and you allow a wheel commission, you 100% should be able to upkick at anytime with the guard says one knee on the ground to knees to the ground. No knees on the ground to gray on your back. You should be able to get back to your feet. It's a viable technique and the guy shouldn't be so confident that he can close the distance. Okay. The only reason he is so confident that he can close the distance and get get ahold of you is because you can't kick up kick them when you have one knee down. Right. It's a bullshit strategy. What's it bolsters strategy based on a bullshit safety. So Eddie, there's no commission out there. Now he's got everyone going sizzler and he calls him crazy. But I, like I said, I've never been to a show like that.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       I mean damn all the way you sold me Bro. Do you guys think this one dude shot tree? He's the man that gentlemen. It's like he just wants the best show. He's uh, he's half Thai, half Japanese. Who a is. Does the commentary for English does rich Franklin, rich Franklin just moved there to work for him. I said they pay some rich, rich Franklin. Ben Aspirin wants to move there and his shots was just move to Singapore and worked for one FC. Holy Shit. He's done buddy. But great thinking about retiring, asking us, thinking about us, thinking about our time never gets to the UFC. That's such a fucking shame. Yeah, that guy's an animal, man. I can't see you and beat our jam right now. Do you guys think that you should job, do you think it should be illegal to be, if you're inside control Geneva head hundred percent really when you're on your hand, and we should be able to, don't be in that position.

Speaker 1:          00:27:37       Right? If you, if you know, if you guy can get you inside control, you should be fucking scrambling like a wild cat. And if you're not scrambling like a wildcat, it means you're compromised. And if you're compromised, they means you either got too tired or you got to hurt and that guy should be able to capitalize a need of the head when you're down. The only time it's a problem in my eyes is when you can't move your head. That's why pride was superior in that respect because they had those ropes so you can go on to the ropes and avoid soccer kicks. You could avoid stomps, you could avoid knees. The only argument against soccer kicks and stomps and knees to the head is the fucking cage. Getting your head pressed up against the cage and getting stuck. In my opinion, that makes it a problem because you can't, the guy can't get out of the way of a strike, so then the artificial boundaries of the cage becomes a weapon.

Speaker 1:          00:28:22       It becomes, obviously you can strategize to get the fuck away from it. Don't let it happen to you. If it does happen to you, it's very dangerous. It makes fights more exciting because there's more opportunities for chaos, but you're going to shortened careers. I have a different point of view on it in that I don't think that when you don't have knees to the head, we in San position are when your hands are on the ground or for example, soccer kicks. I don't think it makes, if you added those things, I would do think of a do two things. It would not make the sport more exciting, but it would make it more brutal and it would probably shortened careers. So in my opinion, I, it's brutal enough and has enough technique to, I know, but to not allow certain like, but things, so I think more brood. I, yeah, I've kicked her different story and I was thinking that he's trying to rip your knee off and you can kick them like from that position. I think that's the luck. Yeah, you could break somebody's allowed brains if they got their head cut caught in a bad spot and you actually stomp on it 100% can you imagine just Brock Lesnar? Cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well listen man, I didn't match exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:29:29       Also asking him, I asked him about, I go, what if a fighter wants to wear spat like or irrational anyway, rash guard. And whose decision is that? It goes, my decision. I go, so Kiddo. I mean women were rash guards all the time. It's never a problem in a, in an MMA fight. It's never like what do we do with the wounds? Rash guards, we can't have them fight topless. What are we going to do? It just like you just swear rash guard. No, but no big deal. There shouldn't be uh, uh, you know, a rule prohibiting fighters, male fighters from wearing rash guards in my opinion. I mean it's not a big deal for women. Why, you know, and he, he agreed, he said he would let anybody wearing anything cause you want to wear a geek and one FC. You can wear a geek. You can work at Kido pants if you want. In one FC. I think you should be able to wear jeans. And I think you should tell him no, no gloves and gloves. If you can need something in the head, elbows, someone in the face, you can kick them in the head with your fucking Shin. My Shin is so much less vulnerable than my hand.

Speaker 1:          00:30:30       No, but take away the paddle and the knuckles. If you're going to have padding, we should have padding on the shins. We should have padding on the knuckles. We should have absolute patting on the heel cause the heels the most dangerous in my opinion because I could wheel kick something. You could hit something really hard. It doesn't really hurt your heel. Right? But you get, you punch someone in the head. You have a really good chance if you hit the forehead of breaking your hand. I've never heard of a guy we'll kick and grind ahead and hurting his foot. I mean, I've hurt my foot to the point where I was limping, but I didn't hurt my foot. I never broke it. It was like our we, but that was our, we office someone's fucking head. Right. You know like the, the idea that you could pat up your knuckles, you don't pat of your heel.

Speaker 1:          00:31:09       It's crazy. Your heels. A goddamn hammer. I mean t, what's that dude's name? There's a dude who just fought in Bellator recently. I'm going to pull this up because I told this kid I would give him props, but he'd knocked out somebody with an ax kick. I saw that as my background. Might be the only time ever. Hey Joe. It was after the main card though, right? Like he was the, he was on either before the card or after the main car doors do. So there'll be the main event and then it's over TV and then we'll have guys fight after. Yeah, like one or two guys fight after. Okay, homeboy. His name is Eric Davis. Yeah, Alfie are Davis. Alfie Art Davis and he acts kicked Kudzu acts. He acts kicked a dude and and which sweat this dome. Oh wait a minute. Go again. Back it up again.

Speaker 1:          00:31:58       Here we go. Watch this. Oh no way. Come on. Told you someone was going to do that eventually. Cause that's happened. I've seen that happen. And [inaudible] Hook kick. That's what I want to see if that, I don't think Derrick, the black beast Louis. No, that wasn't, that one wasn't, that wasn't Bella. I, but I do just for answer. But Derrick Lewis got knocked out by Sean Jordan with a front leg hook kick. Get the fuck out of that. Sean Jordan, who's 250 pounds, 260 shithouse British bulldog but can do backflips whack. Yeah. Shall I draw back Lsu Hook kick front leg bill Wallace. That's awesome. Style Shin Shun join was a freak. He's freak athlete. Here it is. Here it is. Oh, what? Yeah, that was actually, it looks like you brought it from the back of that. Yeah. And it looked like it was almost a sidekick. Right? Let's say it again.

Speaker 1:          00:32:51       Boom. It's definitely a hook now. You're right. I'll show it in slow motion. You see the hooking? It could be a shitty sidekick. Yes. In cause I mean look at it. No, it's a straight up hook kick from karate. Karate back. Boom. I mean, that's amazing. It Derek's like why even though you don't train for that as a heavyweight, he's a crazy athlete. Football background, football. Yet. We're supposed to go to the NFL, flip 250 pounds full backflip. Ooh, five should I be built like a, like just a troll, like the thing from a fantastic guy. They said he was going to UCLA as a fullback or whenever he was and he was that big and he was dunking a basketball. He's just standing there and just jumping in and going. I was like, what the fuck? Shut Sean. Jordan was supposed to go to the NFL, but he got caught with some uh, Brazilian supplements crossing the border and then it fell.

Speaker 1:          00:33:47       It was like, we're good. Go. We're all set. Yeah. Oopsies he's a freak though. You got to send those in the mail side named Mark Courses. Same. We get a bugs. You get over stuffed animal animal teddy bears to a sick care of your buddies up. Nothing to lose. Put up their ass. Come on. What are you doing tomorrow? Listen, you still have student loans. It's time to become a Buell time to become a mule. I hope Nate wins. If like if one day in the future you have 100% transparency and you get to see all the crimes that are committed all across the one how many times per day or dudes coming across the border with drugs up there ass. Oh my God, my God, I got him a mass right now. I've been offered a few. What's the number though? A hundred a day and more play more thousand a day.

Speaker 1:          00:34:38       A couple of dudes do that day got caught going through Kennedy, I think with coke taped all over their body to the bullet up randomly. Touchdown man. That's a big risk to plus the, but I think dogs can only smell one thing. And they usually use them for bombs. No, because with a drug dogs though, they can smell, you know he'll have with drug dogs, but don't, that motherfucker did a good job. That's very smart and good job on your ass. You know what he should've done? He should've got it shaped like one of those Batman suits where all the muscles are like he's intentionally do it. Yeah. Yeah. But he's in deep shit. Guy's going to jail. He's going to give, Ooh, look at that vagina. Cain. Cocaine. Pretty giant. A giant. Wow. That's looks like it's a butterball. That pitch has a big pussy. Yes. Well, I feel sick now. Once you've had a few kids, I guess you could probably get a Turkey in there. It's cool to us play that makes

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       them feel safe. Six kids, half a pound. That's impressive. Christ and her veggies. Think about what Gil Kane, if you pack it tight, isn't it like a rock? Half a pound might only be like a fist big tube, but might be giving this gal more credit than she deserves. Look at the size of that fucking thing and the thing is almost always the saying this. Tell me, Oh perspective. Now it's almost as thick as my cock. If you look, it could be a pill. Oh, look at veto. Coming out for the last time. Maybe. What if veto like, I mean he's only got one more fight left in his contract. He thought this was the last fight and then he was going to leave. Yeah, you fucked up. He didn't count. Right? Not a good sign. And then, uh, one of the other things you said recently that was crazy, he's like, he wants to make UFC bigger than Uber and everyone was like, hey homie, Uber is crashing right now.

Speaker 3:          00:36:26       If you understand like the amount of punishment that Uber's taking online. Huge. $300 million million dollar loss. First quarter. Yeah. All sorts of controversies attached to Uber. Like what? Oh, that's a good question. The CFO to their final button, a bunch of people that's a little bit troubles, but they'll come back. Uber. Yeah. But it's just a weird time. Uber, the actual idea and the service didn't work out or is it, was it just bad? That's a good question. I don't know what, you know, I looked at it peripherally like I saw like, oh, Uber's in trouble again. Uber's of the new president has said some shit that they, they've lost a lot of money and that helps lift. Yeah. That Lyft is, um, the new version. Right. That's what a lot of people use. It's like the 99 cent store for Uber. It's kind of funny.

Speaker 3:          00:37:12       I know uses Uber and it's awesome. You ever fucking fucked up Uber Pool and accident and people share. There's like six people in the car damage. You were trying to save money. I'm like, I just did on accident cause it automatically goes to it and I'm like, what the fuck? I'll just fucking wait other people's houses. I got an Uber for my friend and uh, he was gonna, he was going into my podcast. So I'm watching him from his house and I'm watching the car doing all these fucking terms like flexible Victorians. Jesus Christ, you'll be towards crazy pucks flexible. He's just doing standing splits. Oh yeah. He's a fucking athlete, man. Oh my God. One of the greats, man. If this guy never had a chemical controversy, you know what I mean? If we, if we, we had a frozen time machine from 1997 on and you've got it all dialed in.

Speaker 3:          00:37:59       He bought one of the grace of all teachers, the one that he's one of the ones that got caught. Yes. That's what I think for sure. But he's also an interesting case Vittorias in that, you know, he's had like these spectacular victories and then also some really brutal defeats and his spectacular victories are very rare because he's a sprinter. He attacks you in sprints at you, which a lot of people don't do. Like v Torches Dean's you a little peek a little bit and then he sprints back in the day. It has. He ever doesn't work these days. Guys know it, right? I don't know. See, didn't the TRT, it absolutely worked, but he's also 40 right, so it's like every bit of man. Like what is [inaudible]? There's a, there's something to be said for the strategy of your heard a guy in MMA, you have little gloves on and he just fucking swarm him.

Speaker 3:          00:38:47       But you're going all in, all chips in. Has He ever been down? Has He ever been down and come back? That's a question. Yes. When Anthony Rumble Johnson, you got fucked up. I rumble Johnson in Brazil, rumbled, didn't even make one 85 rumble was way over one 85 this was back when rumble went up from one 70 to one 85 didn't even make one 85 put a beaten on veto and then ran out again. Ah, ah. Yeah. Who else choked rumble out to people? Forget about, ah, yeah. Rich Clemente motherfucker school. How about that? Rich [inaudible] who used to fight at 55 that was, that was that young, dumb, crazy. You know what? It was 100% he cut too much weight and he couldn't sustain it. When we did warrior, he was kind of, he was walking around at two 35 to 35 I remember asking him, I said, you're a giant.

Speaker 3:          00:39:39       And I said, you're going to suck down on one 70 I go, how are you gonna do? And he goes, I'll make it. And he did such a mad idea, man. I think that's one of the reasons why five pounds, he had this bad feeling about MMA in the first place. Yeah. You know, when he says he doesn't like fighting him and make Jesus Christ, you're one of the top two fucking light heavy weights on the planet. Top two or three. I mean, rumbled beat him. I mean a DC beat him the last time. Oh, there's these two spectrums. Brown's time. Awesome. Vito Belfort, four 50 54544503452 couple of veterans than sink earlier. And for those who don't know, Brendan Schaub density trained with Nate Marquardt back in the day and you said you never saw him lose around. Never, never. And you know realize right it. And they trained together too for the rumble Johnson camp.

Speaker 3:          00:40:29       We all flew out there to help you so that you know, they know each other a little bit and they're also Jesus' brothers. If you don't know that you're there, they're also brothers and we're going to see who Jesus likes the most. And this fight when Nate is Wilkin quite thick. Yes, he is strong as shit. Nate is a freak athlete, man. Yep. Super Freak. He's awesome. If I since he was 17 it's almost like Nate just just missed the time periods. You know, like if Nate in his prime, whoa. Nate is coming strong here man. He looks very confident. He looks very fast too, man. Beautiful trip. Vito Vito Vitorin his back is not good. This is not good except against Jon Jones against Jon Jones. Jon was slacking, left his arm out there and [inaudible] pulled off the rare armbar off his back and hopped on his arm.

Speaker 3:          00:41:16       That fight too much. Sorry. No, you look at veto with the elbow from the bottom was actually a very strong people asleep on h Jitsu too. He's a legit black moon widget and he's a fucking strong dude too. And if you could hold Vito here and beat him up and he's doing aggressive shit too, like you sticking, it's fucking to see old Nate man. It's such a smart move by Nate. Cause veto or like you said, he's only dangerous than the first. Really the first round. After that he tailors off so bad. So for Nate, this and the sec around, I bet he tico. Wow. Especially the Vituro of today. That's what I'm saying. His, his testosterone levels. He says her super depleted and he's got a real problem and yeah, I mean it's a weird argument, right? I mean, why are they depleted? You're only 40 you don't stand them up.

Speaker 3:          00:42:03       It's a dominant position. That's terrible. Fuck you. It's Brazil, Bro. We want to see people bang. Yeah, but that's terrible. They're doing it because it's Brazil. Yeah, that's right. I mean mean mean. I don't know how many warnings he gave him. Oh, we're not listening to the commentary. Well, he's trying to move vittores tighten them up. We know. It looks like to me here, it looks like Nate is like super confident coming in here. This is a like a Nate who knows his opponent and feels real good that about his chances. He looks confident. He doesn't like tentative at all. Mad Skinny. He knows he's Vito or just physically does not look that good. He told us just waiting for that one. Like, look at the look at the excess body weight around his waist and his legs look of consistent 40 though gap, but fires away that I'm 50 and I don't have that.

Speaker 3:          00:42:53       And by the way he's, his endocrine system is probably a little bit, you know, compromise. Well that's what I'm saying. Yeah, 100% yeah. He also, Oh shit. Get away. I just dripped. Oh this way. You can't caught that one to the body to go rough. But I mean he caught it on his elbows. Fucking scroll. Front leg side, kick to the leg. I love that kick and it's got some treks kids. I love that people are doing that now. That's a legit technique. You know the people think that it's damaging to the name. You think it's dirty. What about heel hooks? Look, it's a good technique. If you can kick the leg, that's a good way to kick the leg. And what are we doing here? You could blow a guy's knee out with a, with a regular tie kick. I can't believe that's even a debate.

Speaker 3:          00:43:32       I can't believe it is. He was thinking sturdy. The Jackson camp really wants who started it. They do it brilliantly. We other really did. And they also do with that elliptical kick, which are uh, that. Um, what's it not elliptical care. What am I working on? The word oblique kick. That's a beautiful kick. That's a beautiful kit because it's wheat that fucking flying knees down to my leftover there. Whatever your name is. It's Brennan shot. Oh, sorry. Brennan shop. You fought in UFC door does not look good here. I get excited. My test, my test, my test starts spiking. Guys, when I watch fights. What about when you hear engines? They said no, no. It goes down. If you let your testosterone to spike and no disrespect, bring up vittores wife. Good God. Yeah. God Mighty. They'll Brazilians will, how to make a wall. You're going to talk about my standup and coming to my show? No, I dunno. I Dunno. It's in Irvine. June 8th ninth and 10th and good Jack, you brought that up name Nate gave him a finger like Yep, you got me there. The one finger, not the bad thing. Right. Got It. Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       nice. Couple of couple of front foot leg kicks, guys cook. He said, no you didn't. Oh Geez, Nate. The thing is where does, where did these guys go after this? You know what I'm saying? Like the winner that heaven, one fc to Ralph was there. Vitro is going to show up when the party Vito is going to dress like a soundbite fighter with shoes on combat. Sambo. I love it. They just went like, let's take this but not this. Let's take the shoes but not the wrestling singlet. Let's go with it. But not the pants. Okay. So we'll go with head forgot. Beat tours at Tristar. No, for Rasa. Hobby for hostels. That's racist for us. Her Robbie. Oh damn is is damn good. Brian Cowen. I'm sorry if I'm shooting to the microphone. I got you. I got your, your wine. They get your cheese.

Speaker 1:          00:45:31       Got here. We're going into their next, she made it free to leave it. I'm already going. No, no, no. You're, you're, you're in California. You still in California at Eddie. Philip, Philip. Finish off California. Do. I Dunno. I'm working on it, but uh, not for comedy. Just for hanging out and went to the Amalfi coast. Changed Year. I had a great time. It felt real good. What the fuck is my copy to? Really, sorry. Oh sorry. There's something about the way people live in other countries where they're super relaxed and they re but let me tell you something man. I had a really interesting conversation with a cab driver. Cab driver was driving us around who takes cabs? I do. We were in a place and they had a cab and you know we've got a cap. They have cabs there. Oh word here around round tube.

Speaker 1:          00:46:13       One of the interesting thing the guy said, he goes, ah, he goes, I want my children to grow up in America. And I said, why? And he goes, because he goes, man, he goes, there's opportunity. He goes here, there's not much you can do. He was a smart dude and he was a cab driver. And so we started having this like kind of cool conversation cause he spoke, I believe he spoke four languages. He said maybe they're very smart business B. This was in Amalfi coast. Where's that? It's in Italy. It's a, there's a place called Ravello and rubella. Rubella or Velo I think is rubella. But anyway, it's beautiful. Gorgeous. I mean, it's just pretty, the beaches are nice. The oceans gorgeous. And the people are just awesome people. Just so nice and friendly and interesting. But they, they, they don't have a lot of opportunity as far as like, um, careers.

Speaker 1:          00:46:58       More the simple life according to this guy. I mean, I mean if you live there and don't, don't, yeah, according to this, but the cab driver was very educated. He was a smart fucking dude. We got super lucky. We went there and we went to Rome and, uh, we went to Rome. We had a really good, a guy named Mark Court. Ladies and gentlemen don't owe any fucking hand. Dude. He looks great. He looks fucking great to be, be this wine to earthy, bro. A beautiful wine. It's super earthy. He's that good. Do you? It's a lot

Speaker 3:          00:47:29       too earthy from alcohol. Real number. Cut vetoed. Just tagged him with a left upper cut. Why don't shake his head kick five feet tour cuts. Oh, Shit. Uh, time up Nate Dogg. Yes. No mate, Nate's coming back. This is a fight guys. Holy Shit. What a fight right hand by Nate dog won a fight. Man. Is this an argument for no testing? I yes it is. Fuck yes it is and I'm currently makes sense. Neither of these guys are good testing in there. I'm kidding. They're testing. I'm, yeah, but, but still I, I would like to see guys who need a little help fight for longer. It's called the master's division. Nate Marquardt was one of the only guys that's ever been pulled from the car. Is that real? How dare you? That's horrible. Dare you put that back up. How dare you put that bag of sweet.

Speaker 3:          00:48:13       You look dog that. That's a beautiful look. It's incredible. I got to get on testosterone right now. I think that's more than test. All right, well I'm to do whatever he's doing. It's post endocrin crash two on the righthand side, like a healthy looking dude who's 40 years old. Right? It can be pretty jammed and apparently the birds compromise looks terrible then. Yeah. What's compromise? His endocrine systems compromised. But Nate is one of the only guys that Sarah had been pulled off of a card because he was on legal TRT and he shit was so high. They was, hey, hey, hey. No. Do supposed to be fighting Rick story to keep him and beat him to buy tomatoes defense. I know exact cost went down. The doctor Nate didn't remember. Sure. The shot's himself. The doctor didn't, and he's like, no, you're fine. And it was like, you sure?

Speaker 3:          00:48:59       And he goes yes. And gave him the shot. Yeah. Yeah. He went to the doctor. Feel good. It's looking good. It's looking good man. He looks real good. She got here, he had a red beard. Look at that. It's switching up. Looking at us in touch. Nate Dogg. Yeah, natives. He switched it up good. And he's also turning that left leg in. Good. Like to get rid of the check. That kick. He's sharp, man. It's a better rest though. She'd take two more take downs. Well, he got that one in the first round. I got stood up. He might be a little bit hesitant now. You might say, oh, he's looking very good. We're on the champ. Oh, look at that cohort rule plan here. Wow. Oh ha ha. What it means. Fuck. It means balls. I mean, Dick Hands-up Gracie used to always say that. He'd always be like, boy, Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:49:48       It's like fuck. It's like when you say fuck, you know, you can say fuck or you can say shit. It's the same thing. Some of his bikes like [inaudible] boy do. Do you remember when Nate Dogg Fuck Woodley and strike force for the belt and straight like Congress ministry that Nate Marquardt that finish was one of the finest. Oh, look at that big cut on vitro. Oh, we won't. The head kick. No body. Nate, Nate, Nate, Nate. Nate is no dope. Always swinging shit. Do Nate looks fucking fantastic. He does. Yeah, he does not. Since the CB Dalloway fighters, he looked as good and that was a one punch knockout.

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       He knocked him the crazy. Yeah, but that was way back in the dead. Super old school. Five Dude, I'm calling it. If you knocked out Victoria, let's bring an Anderson spider it again home. I on your back, you imagine? Yeah. He's got as good as it looks here, dude. If he looks as good as you looked here, I just, man, I might have to go with Nate, right? Oh, oh. Oh. How about, but listen, Vito, Vito, our poles for this. How about Horace? Trying to have it. How about that? Vittores going to sail off to rise and just go Bain on us. He's got one more fight, but he's got one more fight in his country. Oh, Dang dumb. They both think these guys are there. A couple of Ding dings. Ooh. Hey Man. [inaudible] bonds called it shit. I call this Dang [inaudible] heard his voice mails to a side piece he called, but it was a girl with Barry bonds. I know what you need. You need some Dang Dang. And it was just like, it didn't help them at all. It was just like a horrible day. Yeah, exactly. Me Too. Don't fucking Barry Bonds for being great, even though it took steroids and likes girls hit me that night. Fucking baseballs. I want them on steroids. Exactly. Whatever it is. Nice.

Speaker 3:          00:51:47       Demised baseball. No UPC kicks in baseball, no feet towards, got a big cup. A lot of scar tissue on that man. I'm sure it's pretty easy to open them up. Look at some highlights. Boom. Clipped him with a right hook. Nate with the high kick to, do you remember the story of veto a sister dying man when they took her for ransom, but there's that upper cut. Yeah, it was horrible. Horrible man. Took it for ransom and they killed her and do the right buyer. Brazil don't put ground. No. That's the worst thing I can imagine. One of the guys working for the UFC. It got held at gunpoint this weekend. Really? Yeah. What happened? Nothing to give them their money was just a production guy. Well God damn,

Speaker 6:          00:52:28       here we go.

Speaker 3:          00:52:30       Brazil is beautiful. It's dangerous as shit. Well, you know Chicago's dangerous. Two men go to the wrong place in the afternoon on the south side. Yeah, just as dangerous and a lot of places it's just, you know, you can have crime everywhere. You know where it's not dangerous. Australia, Australia is beautiful. I'm headed there tomorrow. I love it. I love Australia. Nervous as shit about it. Why are you nervous, Sydney? I don't know why you let us necessarily traveling, man. I don't travel. Might as well be Americans. They'd be like, they're like, you know what I say? Canadians are 20% less douche bags then a American the way nicer. Same thing with Australia. They're like Canadians with a cooler accent. Wow. I'm sold. Did the shit. I lived there. I could live there. It's not even in America. They drive on the left side of the road.

Speaker 3:          00:53:12       Never been there. I'd live there. How dare you not go there? I know what he's been offered. Your 50 go there. I've been offered. I just haven't gone. I love it too busy training. I went to melt. Wow. Okay. I went to Melbourne last year, maybe year and a half ago. She do shows out there. Joe Now. Fucking loved it. Yeah. You do chose. Yeah. Did a couple shows out there that love you, Brendan. Brendan's going to be there and he's sold out a bunch of theaters. Yeah, they'll love you for sure. They're great people and by the way, big as United States. Same amount of people as la. We're going to dig that entire kind of chose as big as the United States. Yup. Cause he can take you a start with Alaska. I did nothing in the middle. Right. It's like on the skirt. The middle kills you. Everything in the Middle East. Your ass eat your ass and then in the ocean and shark city.

Speaker 3:          00:53:53       Yeah, the ocean sharks city. The water around the ocean is crocodile city and you get deep inside. You got snake city and spider city. They have brown snakes. They kill you instantly. Tiger snakes, a bunch of spiders to kill you instantly enjoying the water to cool off crocodiles boxes, box, jellyfish box jumps. They fucked. Some guy sent me a picture of a saltwater croc passing a great white. Oh Jesus Christ. I think it was photoshopped. It might not be. Let's say it helped you live in the Australian doctor sent me that. Sorry guys. Doctors sometimes are not savvy with the Internet. They have student loans to think about it and they doctor photographs.

Speaker 3:          00:54:32       He's not a professional. Made my mark car with a fucking dude inside kick these, these. This is red. How do you call this fight? Right? He needs to finish him. These guys are bruised up because Gilbert fuck around. Sel Brasil is looking great. We'll vittores a legend so he's already up to rounds. You know what men? Nate looks super strong in this fight. It does. It's back is looking swollen like by super strong technique again. That's got to his defense looking good too. Well, he looks like health. Not Tired at all. Yeah, he looks healthy. Right? I think also a big thing for Nate was going up to one 85 improved this CIM. It improved his, his vitality. Yeah. I just think being at one 70 he was so depleted. Who's a big s seven oh, he's huge. He's so big. Walk around at 12 feet is so strong, man. Oh Man. He just clipped detour. Did he catch him with that left hook? Did it graze them grace because he grades them.

Speaker 3:          00:55:32       This is an interesting fight, man, because I think both of these guys kind of at the end of their UFC rope, right? Arguably. Oh, tagged them. Boom Pole on the back. Nine. You both look right, but they're both, they're both like, if you didn't know that and you saw this well veto, you tell kind of by his body, you'd be like, something's going on. He's a legend though. So he put up with the body fat. Yeah. Well it's not just the body fat. It's like there's a looseness to him all. We, I kicked him with the left. He a bunch of muscle down there to so much more meat. It's all gone. So meeting, but it's technique is still really good. Have such a freak. Oh Jesus Christ caught that on the, on the elbow. People Forget. Vitro is one of the best athletes that ever coming the octagon.

Speaker 3:          00:56:17       Come on on the steroid. Shit out. Guidance Stroll. We'll kick at all until he fights. Luke Rockhold throws one in missing sometimes. Another one at Kaos him. Oh boy. Nate got hurt there. You got tagged. Well, he went looking for that takedown. Looking at what I call an educated jab guys. Oh, but that left high kick is strong and they keeps moving to is right. Yeah. You could block that all day, dude. This shit is going to fuck your arms. I'll tell you what's weird is, was Tristar with GSP for ab. Oh Shit. Dang done with that head kick. So I'm wondering for us really helped Vittori with his game plan for sure. You know, some fucking trailer or something about, I can't believe what you're saying. I'm just kidding. I'll let you for us, look at that right writer when they show Nate's right side, like, look how red his fucking arm is.

Speaker 3:          00:57:00       He's also Pale as fuck. I know, but that's why you can see the impact. Like when you have a super white boy, you get to see like where he's been getting scratched up in the white boy. Yeah. How long was the veto with for, for us just this case. Just what does it, all the redness all over Nate's arm has been known to jump around campus. That's kind of his thing. Hmm. Well sort of, but I mean not that much. I mean a lot of guys have jumped around more than him slapping me from named Mark White Ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker 6:          00:57:27       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:57:27       Oh Damn. That's tough in Brasil. They're probably going to be a great fight. Great fight. One round one and two. That's great. Fine. Not balls deep and cheese and half a glass of wine, but from my perspective, one and two, as long as more cheese, I'm time traveling from that weed. Goddamn la speed. We'd would the, what is I say it was bamboo leaves or something like that. They wrap these blunts with, with bamboo now Sam's panda style. Yeah, some quality bear style. That's a beautiful installers. Don't fuck with bamboo. Oh man, they didn't have that wrap. That's all right. Come on. You guys stopped, was it? No, no, not at all. The other day. No, I don't got shit on it. Yeah. Yeah. I know what you're talking about on second angel dust or something real. The real interesting thing, if you're going to go blunt, you really should go Charlie Murphy style, which is where you take a Swisher sweets, classic the weed and you put it inside, take the tobacco out and so then you're getting the harshness of the tobacco and you get that weird tobacco buzz from the outside. They had that weird nicotine buzz. I like it. Nicotine buzz every now and then, man. I've smoked cigarettes before. I've done, yeah, what a great times, but I've smoked a couple of cigarettes before going on stage before. I like, this was a great fight, man. What's up Donald Serone. Oh yeah, I ate some dip. Oh fuck that. I swallowed some Dick. He took cigarettes. Every now and then. I say Nate's got it. But you should win two to one. It's personal, but do they have the same split decisions? Let's see what we got here

Speaker 6:          00:58:56       for this contest.

Speaker 3:          00:58:58       Oh, all three feet tall. Piece of shit. Brazil. I'll fuck you. Oh, come on. Put his hands on this. Damn. It's Brazil. That's you got to figure you up. You're just like Glen Brazilian lose around I guess. I Dunno. Good fight though. Those are terrible jersey. I say the feet, right? Definitely. That last round to one. So you thought vitro one, two? No, no, no, no. Hell No. Nate one, one and two, and then he, then Vito in the third round. Veto anything again. I paid a shitload of provolone. I've had some wine and a lot to watch some good moments of the fight by [inaudible] and I thought I saw a few more good moments by Nate, but I was in no means judging the fight by no means profit. Brian Stan with a pink tie. Confident gentlemen. It's not a big deal. You know, even a fee. Those first two, he did lose the first round kind of big right cause he got taken down. I'm struck, it was all about Brazil. Is Brazil going with the new rules? They do it the fuck didn't want, but did they, did they have the new rules? Like as far as judging and everything like that? I don't think so. Texted classy man. The Texas doesn't, uh, doesn't accept those rules. Brazil is the wild west and New York. That's it. Everyone else you're, they're false shoot with, well New York has just juvenile New York. They're just morons.

Speaker 3:          01:00:25       What it is is they just don't have a lot of experience. New York state is only had MMA for a year or so, so they're just going through growing pains. I feel like that's what's going on with New York. It's just, when I say juvenile, I mean like they're childish. They just start having a had a while, but the mistakes they're making, I mean you're talking to in extreme mistakes, but who made that mistake was Dan Merkel, Yada Dan Margiela Yada is a super experienced referee. The guy who made the mistake in the Mercury Yada, it was a merger led to her. I thought it was herb dean. Which one was Mark Liata? There's what? Which one was the Musashi fight? Was that herb? Dino. Herb Dean. Okay. Then the mercury out of fight was, there was another woman was in New York. Was it Weidman? Weidman watch one was Weidman was saucy. I thought. I thought it was her.

Speaker 3:          01:01:09       Her Dean was born. That was that one, but there was one with a, there was one with American Liana recently. Either way, the point being both Margiela Yada and herb dean are excellent refs and no shit goes wrong. Man. Her been fucking up lately though. He's my favorite fucking up. A lot of people have been saying that. I'm not going with that. Well I'm, it's just, I mean you're going to fuck up every now and then. You're going to fuck you really can't breath. I fuck up and submission only and I fuck up every now and then. I've done maybe two or three big fuckers. Fucking done 1,000,005. You're alive man. How can you not fuck up that kind of speed? And sometimes I think I'm saying like [inaudible] but I'm really saying Nate like I'll fuck it. I'll have it in my head. Cause crossed because what I'm trying to just, I'm trying to pay attention and I'm all trying to talk at the same. No, it's not the weed. No, because I'm doing, here's his back. I don't do the UFC high ever. Ever. I did like two high ever. I didn't like it like when they back in the day, back in the day, like 2002 or something like that. But, um, I don't do them high cause I don't wanna I don't want to ever have the urge to talk about some shit fight related

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       because that's what this is. Like, this is the whole, this fight, this fight companion podcast shows the whole reason why I should never do. We'd what does that, when you watch it, that's more Gelada there. That's the Weidman was saucy fine. Okay. So I was right. So Weidman versus Musashi was Dan burglary, Yada. Um, the other one that was similar, there was another one that was similar. That was herb dean. That was a recent funding fowl as well. Who, what was the fight people on line right now? Oh no, it's dirty. Alvarez and pouring. Yes. Thank you very much. My fucking beautiful, beautiful, beautiful [inaudible] top on that. So that's, that's a perfect example. I respect super. You got to give me a list of top five best referees on the planet Earth, Dan Merkel, Yada and herb dean or bolt on that list. And they both made errors, although he's number one, he's the gold standards.

Speaker 1:          01:03:15       And by the way, not like this. Oh sure he did. But Marillo Bustamante versus um, oh, in 19 [inaudible] fucked up. He tapped him. Marillo tapped him and then they restarted the fight and did it again. Look, he's the gold standard because of his experience. And that was a mistake. It was just experienced and it was a loss though. Currently though, he hasn't fucked up like he's the best. I feel like big John's the best, but I'm feeling by far, you know, here's another one that doesn't get enough credit because he went to the pokey, Josh Rosenthal, he's Josh Joshua sand outstanding. He's out. He's out. He's out. He's out. But he never got yes, snitched on him.

Speaker 1:          01:03:58       He, I'm a brown belt in Jujitsu. I think it might be black by now, but uh, what's he doing now? He's refereeing and getting, did some keying in the cages and shit. But here's what the referee X. Excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent. [inaudible] he's one of my favorites. Yeah. And also like super like out of the picture, like you don't even know he's there. So his homeboy with the, the Yosemite Sam Mustache, Mike Tran, Swan Beltran Bell trends in my top 10 in the world to stop three from, he's one of the smartest. I've deal with a lot of people in the industry over the years. He's one of the smartest dudes I've ever met and Mike is fucking great human being held. Is he so nice? I'll try him. Nicest guy that got to be nice about tomato mustache like that. By the way, you knew he was a cop and you're a Mongol.

Speaker 1:          01:04:45       He was like, Huh? He was like an undercover, uh, I think an undercover, like special detective thing that might wanna look at your phone off. Yeah. I don't know. Mike Beltrani was, hey, was an undercover like, oh, I shouldn't say that. If he's not sure, he will double down. I, no, no, actually, maybe I shouldn't be talking about it and it's too late. You Fuck, sorry. Just ratted him out. Now you're going to die by talking about it. What you should do is not, I didn't know that, but I'm just going to look. I got to look at, you know, he's writing a book. I think that didn't give me super skeptical Hipaa wise because he's writing a book. I think he's going to write a book about his, is someone going to true hall of fame? He's writing a book that he was not just in the UFC hall of fame.

Speaker 1:          01:05:26       He, this is soccer. Rob would go into the hall of fame, commentate on, I come in straight from yoga to do these fucking UFC and it looks so fucked up. I look greasy. I have red marks on your face and head, hot yoga. I slept for the next two days, but I just looked at myself, I'm like, they can only usually a couple seconds of video of me. I looked at her lineup, we get done for, I love Sakuraba. Oh Man. Soccer. I grew up in the UFC hall of fame. The greatest. That's what they're doing. I think that's what this is. And then they health, he'd wear shirts that said water on him. He fought in the UFC and also because the UFC owns pride, it's a legit um, oh. So we learned pride guys in 100% they should obey Dorin fade or wanting to lay cro cop bar.

Speaker 1:          01:06:08       But [inaudible] has got that issue. He landed a turning sidekick on Vito or they put them down on the ground, Euler, Euler didn't tap and then they stopped the fight anyway and he's like, no, no, no, no. I didn't tap. What's so cool about broken? So Gracie's arm Anton has a picture of that cancels on, but with a boiler boiler it just didn't tap and the boiler was like, I'm fine man. Like yeah, I'm getting my arm chewed up. But like for a boiler that proved to be the case in your fight Eddie, because when you're that grappling matches that you fucked his leg up. I remember watching that from the sidelines and I was like, this shit is so over. The last guy he just took it. He just let his knee get mangled or is he that flexible dude, there's no way he can be that flexible. He's just tough as shit. He's just tough as shit. He dealt with it. He dealt with getting his knee torn apart. Hence a wash on the paper.

Speaker 1:          01:07:07       Hence roof. Curious to tap. Yeah, they want some swatches. He just walked as his own fucking arm break. He will not tap. I'm eating this cheese like a Monday. Can Jake at afraid? Isn't that crazy? Yeah. Shot. Trey wants me to do a tone in did a supermatch. Shachi wants me to have one that can Sakharova. Did you see, did you do it? Are you going to do it? But how's your back dude? I don't know man. My back is not 100% yet. How's your back for a hundred thou? What? They offered you like serious cheese. We haven't even. How's your back for hunkered down on a wheel of challenge? I want you to shut the fuck up. I'm negotiating for them and we're not starting at a hundred. No. You at least the hunting. Some cheese bro and all this cheap. We're talking about check or is it coming up and talking about dollars?

Speaker 1:          01:07:56       A couple of things. Shackles still haven't recovered from my back surgery one too. I'm trying to find out if I'm, I need, I might need surgery on my shoulder. I'm not sure I've been doing that. Hang in therapy. I don't know man. Hang right now. Not yet. But based on those videos that I'm watching about the hanging that uh, you know, if you have any kind of tears, if you hang, eventually it'll fix it up. That's what I'm hearing is that wrong? Hinged mints. What it is is one of the things that happens with people with shoulder injuries is you get a lot of pain from impingements means your mobility is impaired because he get tears and damage and then your shoulder sort of like gets scar tissue to never, it never increases its mobility or never regained his mobility. And one of the best ways to regain your mobility, get on a chin up bar and fucking hang.

Speaker 1:          01:08:44       Just hang. And I hang every day, every day. It's one of the main things I do. There's two main things. How long do you do it for? Two minutes. But I'll just start out with 30 seconds. Just loosen up, get my hands loose now and then I'll let it go. And then sometimes I'll go into a minute and a half and sometimes they going to two minutes. But I take my iPhone, I put it on, I hit the stopwatch and then I hang. And you're one of the reasons why I did it because when we, first of all, because it's really good for your shoulders, but two, because we did fear factor and we had men and women hanging and the women, all one the men couldn't hang glider cause him. Yes, because the men are too heavy and they couldn't hold their weight up because if you're a man, even if you have stronger hands, is stronger muscles, the amount more that you weigh like against 130 pound woman, you, you know, most guys are weak in that regard.

Speaker 1:          01:09:30       And most primates, that's one of the things about the shoulder, like our shoulders came from primates. So the premise behind this hanging is that some of the, the lack of mobility and impingements and problems that we have at our shoulder joint is simply from a lack of your shoulder articulating correctly and stretching out like and, and doing sozo doing range of motion things like I do a lot of um, Kettlebell a shield casts with, I'm not a Kettlebell, but a club. I do these shield casts, which are really big. So these big movements, you got to wield the sword. And another thing I saw, wonder woman bro Strong. Yes. I think I do that I really recommend is bottoms up kettle bells. Will you put the kettle bell upside down and you're, you're working on some serious stability. This is only 40 pounds, but not man.

Speaker 1:          01:10:17       Very difficult to do like that. I don't know. That's pretty impressive. Let me see Brian try that. Well, I could do it now. It's 70. I want to, I started out, okay, can I bring you to Italy for a second and pull your little wine? Then I'll then I'll show you how that shoulder was fucking, it was that, that shoulder. I had to have a, I had a stem cell shots. Shots already sold as Jackson. The show that I'm pulling back, I shot maybe 80 arrows today with the 86 can we put this up? He was smoking my before. Well, no, he did it ladies and gentlemen. It's hard to balance. Well that's really good. It's really good for stroke, shoulder stability. They will, let's just start off light. If anybody's doing it and I recommend no more than five repetitions, I believe in that for weightlifting. I believe in no, no more than five repetitions and I think you're really cardio. Yeah. Your cardio and your endurance should be done doing other things. Either skill work like martial arts, whether it's Jujitsu or kickboxing or strength and conditioning work like running

Speaker 2:          01:11:18       and shit like that. Fucking 12 reps send them an email. I don't think so. Sun lift off your 250 pounds. No, no. Pretty Shock. Reminds House, you look gross sir. Shop reps with 600 pound revenue. Not done. Not done. He reps with 600 pounds. That impresses me. Those fuck movements. Oh God, yes. That's the best for him. She kept 600 pound barbell. That's right. Sitting there doing this shit. So even big goes like this motherfucker will let me have a ahead of time now he's, he's, they're strong than the shops. Strong. You've been lifting since you were at, but fourth grade, fifth grade. It's got some 10 Sam, I had a shoulder question. Oh, what was it? Sorry. Just take that goddamn fight. Okay. I like this.

Speaker 1:          01:12:18       Yeah. Well the thing about the bottoms up kettle bells is they say you should be able to do 90% of what you can do. Normally. Most people can't like 99% can't, but they say if you have a real stable joint, what's going to hold you back? It's not strength. It's a stabilizing muscles, the stabilizer stabilizing muscles, the ones that oftentimes cause issues with your range of motion. And with using it in terms of functional strength, like I'm using it for martial arts are fusing it for, you know, anything where you would be using like I guess what I would even think sports, like throwing things. I mean I would think that shoulders to abilities, like super important. I remember when I was going to ask you, when you say no more than five reps, do you mean uh, use the, uh, the amount of weight where you fail five rounds?

Speaker 1:          01:13:05       No, no, no, just regular. I've been following this Pavel Satsu Lien regimen and he created, he's like the godfather of kettle bells in the United States. He's the guy that came over from Russia. He's, he's got a ton of books out and videos and, and his belief is that strength is a skill and that you should never do a skill when you're tired. And so the idea, and I'm, I'm, if I'm paraphrasing and fucking this up please, I apologize. But the principle behind it I know of and the principle is that like say if you can lift something and you get to like seven, eight reps and you get to the age rep,

Speaker 2:          01:13:41       keep

Speaker 1:          01:13:41       going, keep going. It's like she'd never do that because you get the strength from doing the amount of repetitions. Like say if you do five reps, you can get to, if you could do 10 to five but then wait a long time, wait like 10 minutes and then comes took five, wait another, wait another 10 minutes, then do another follow. People would beg to differ. Right? You're right, you're right. A lot of people, a lot of people would, but I guarantee you if you had a cobble on, you should listen to Pavle on Tim Ferriss's podcast. Do a little bit every day. It's kind, Kinda like you do a yes, exactly. You should make sure that you can, you can do that too. But I'm telling you, one of the good things about this is you have people that get injured less because your, your muscles are never working like full fatigued.

Speaker 1:          01:14:23       They're never working to the point of failure, but you're still lifting heavy weight, but you're lifting. Say if you could lift something and you could do 10 repetitions, don't do 10, do five, do five, put it down and take a big long break. But it's not endurance. It's like you do a scene. I'll be doing the same number of reps. The problem is it takes longer. Like you would need to be at the gym for an hour and a half versus 40 minutes and it doesn't burn to death. I had a guy who there's some benefits to it. I think that as best as to, I don't think just doing that all the time. Those, the answer maybe I would love to talk to have you sit down with, you should have him on your show, man. The guys in California, poppy, he's a wizard and he speaks perfect English wiz or did they change your sheets?

Speaker 1:          01:15:07       Three of us should do it because you're a fan. He's a fest. We should do it. I'll do it. I'll do what you guys do it. I want to list, could even have them in here. Um, one of the things that he, that guy brought to, um, to the United States is not just the kettle bell, but also like some serious fucking bodyweight exercises. And then like some movements that now have become, have become like really standard. Like I'm Brian counts pour me from and where are you going to Italy? We need to learn now. Now we're in, in late 2008. I want you to take your time. Like I need a food food. He's going to like my Italy hit. This is via Ben until while I do, but what I was going to say is that, um, uh, Turkish getup, which is a big one of this, it's huge.

Speaker 1:          01:15:48       Turkish get up is so big. There's Pavel, the dude's a stud, by the way. I always wear sweat pants. Hey, bring shab up doing a Turkish get up with one 45 please bring him up. Isn't that ridiculous? It was with a bar, which is even more than that. 200 pounds. Then you do two 25, 225 pound Turkey, one arm techniques. Awful. Yes. The technique is off. It's not that awful begging for a blown disk, but that's still super impressed. Who? 25 225 they're strong in the shop. I told you, hold on, I'm going to get you. I'm going to fruit you up. You want to go California, you want to stay in California? Look at this. How much weight is, is that that right there is one 45 that's one 55 one 55 look at him. He's a fucking beast. And he did it with two 25 is ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          01:16:35       That is ridiculous. The technique shit though. You bet it doesn't matter man. But the point is that you have that kind of core power that you can get up from your feet. And how applicable is that to grappling? So one of the most applicable, like when terms of like functional strength, Turkish get up is one of these most applicable because if you could fucking lie on your back and press something and then sit up with that fucker overhead. That was my move. If you remember like with ruling as soon as the arm would pass them. So I can try to just, oh so strong if you or to Turkish get up. Yeah.

It's a good fucking look. When you make a superhero movie, you're confined to make a movie about a superhero and the good guys to win and you know that going in. She dealt with all that and she did it. She did it on her own terms and it's about us. It's about Patty Jenkins, the dude I don't want to spoil or almost spoiled toilet wonder woman, wonder woman, Patty Jenkins.

Might've daughter used the word, the name asshole today and I had to scold her, oh, you should have led with that guy's an asshole.

Speaker 1:          01:21:11       I was like, hey, write you. She said you're right, but don't tell anybody. Right. But um, the thing about the alien movie is that there's no CGI. It's all like a mummy can't, it's no, it's a dude in a suit. So it looks real. It's fuck, that movie was done so well. Really? Scott was a wizard. They did everything in that dark. Everything was like real sneaky. You only saw the alien for like quick bursts of it. It's just like American Werewolf in London with John Landis. You see it and like, Ooh, sat control. Did you see the new alien? I did not see it yet.

Speaker 1:          01:21:46       Having a hard time getting people to go. No one in my household's capable and my, my wife said I could let her watch the original alien on TV, but I can't take her to the movies to see the new alien. So yeah, wait til it comes down to man. The wife makes the rules. The flux. We were trying to keep all the time, but we were trying to keep it too. We didn't want him, you know, we keep farming. My wife died. Falling was a bet. So we were, we were trying to keep it to, don't toot. Oh No, not her. She's got her eight dash dammit. Whew. That was a big mistake. Fuck. That's a huge, huge victory for her. Oh my God.

It doesn't matter if you're relaxed or if you look nervous. All that matters. It's how your ground game that does happen. So you just like pretending that everything's cool leaning

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       against the fence. That ain't going to, that's not going to wait. What was the mistake she made there? Well, you know once it, so first of all, it's physically a beast. You're in the first round. No one's tired. Yes. She turned towards her. She gave her backup. That's second grade bullied last yards short. It is, man. It's panic shit. You just like, God want muscle my way back up to my feet. But now she's like, I control it. That's where it all ends. But she's, she's controlling here, right? She's got her and she's also, if you her, she's only got one Bush to go one go two on one. She's still, she's fine. And look at that second hook. Once it was under the chin, then she goes second hook. That's deep. Oh yeah. That's how she does an undeniable choke right there. That's like you go to sleep once that stuff is the title shot ally. Thanks. He dies. Well, I really want to see rose because we've seen it. Sorry, Rose Brazilian girlfriend.

Speaker 2:          01:24:15       I would like to see her versus rows. Let's get this started. I was chilling. I would say, oh my foot hurts or an enemy. And you guys go to therapy shortly into random me. Like I'm good. I'll just fuck your belt and you ran it. He's like, yeah, I never really wanted to fight one 45 in the first place going on 35 and that girl arms like you know, let's see Ya. This is her name. John Judge Jack Young Jay. Got It. After two years, I would say 80% of MMA fans know how to say her name. Now she's getting famous. I say he still calls her champion Brian Stann. He calls her you want to champion this cause he can't pronounce it one more time. You're on jet check. Check. Done judge. Like young Jamie. No, no, no. Like why you went and they spell it out for me phonetically when I still read it for the Engencia when I have to.

Speaker 2:          01:25:10       I might be doing it wrong, but when I have to read it, uh, for the Wayans it's like why you and j a y and then check. What was your first, what is your last name? Start with what's the first to Jay Jay. Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay's CSP. Come on Jj. What they call her. I know most people, Young John. Bad idea though. She's the only Jay Jay other than Jon Jones. There's one too much confusion, but the problem is your ingestion sounds like Jay y. That's like one of them. Them tight. Once the Thai guy start flooding into MMA. Oh, you thought you had it hard with the Polish people tie guys come in. They got like 35 letters and the sea for quite some way. Well, why? We're waiting for the next fight comment. You guys see what the fuck tall guys are training. You see what pollution going on, right? Did you see what lion fight did they put this dude Leard Zilla do you know learns

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       La? I love his name already. He is a, he's a multiple world champion. He has 180 [inaudible] him in there with a guy who had zero. No to me. Moy Tai debut fights leart, Zillow and gets head kicked into another fucking dementia. Look up there. Look, do watch this. Look at this. But Watch. Watch the combination though. Wash the combination. Do you hit it again, Jamie? Oh, is it a Instagram wash? This front kick to the body. Bang. Kick. Insane. The other guys in MMA fighter decent record, he's got like a six and four or something comparable. There's a champions training evolve right now. Lured Zilla on earth. Yeah. He's got the best Zillow's real name to relax our shit front kick to the body. And then food round kick out of nowhere. The fuck that guy fight him. He was a fake leg kick to the head.

Speaker 3:          01:27:10       Fake front kick, roundhouse kick or they call question mark kick. But what happened was a bunch of people to lion fights. Uh, this is to, you know, to their credit credit or in the interest of full disclosure, they had two people pull out that didn't want to fight this guy. And I'm like, fuck that. This guy was making his debut so I fucking fight him. He's crazy. If I was his manager, I said, listen to me son. That wasn't an MMA fight though, right? No, no. But it was a guy who had a record in MMA that was like, it wasn't good. It was, I mean, it was a default. The record. Yeah. He had some losses and he had some wins, but he wasn't, he wasn't. Habib never got that off. And we're not talking about a guy who's like an elite world class striker and he's fighting. This guy learned Zillow. Let me see. Oh, fucking assassin. 1000 bucks for that and a headache for a year long headache Nunez versus that is come on top. Robert Wilson car top to bottom Whitaker and that fight. And he goes, well, you never know. No, I'm so that's the main fight. Now that Tj and um, and Cody are out, you all wins. And then he beats bear. You know what the fuck you're talking about. Robert Whitaker could beat anybody in the world.

Speaker 3:          01:28:30       He might wait. Mike, you put the speed. Everybody. Excuse me sir. Excuse me gentlemen. He's paid everybody who's, he lost her jock gray got or you got fucked in that fight. He defeated in MMA thinking that right. Thank you gentlemen. I haven't said it from day one. World two time world champion. Wow. Well, you really picked an underdog brand, but he is a gorilla when it comes to wrestling turtle. It's ridiculous. Shred. They look real. He's going to win the world title at 40 years old. He might, he might, or Robert, Robert Winter might put those fucking kangaroo paws on. Robert Whitaker's going to take that fucking right hand from Australia and knock his ass. I'm going to need you to calm down. You got on the train, you've got this eighties in Saint Jacques and arm, which I appreciate it. And thanks from early 2000 whatever the new kids on the block, it'll be new kids on the block.

Speaker 3:          01:29:19       First of all, I appreciate it. Thank you. I admire your courage, your fashion courtesy. Thank you. I'm also outraged at the same time. It's okay in the pot that you did. You get it for free once he bought it. We've got a new kid on the block, man. He got out the new kids on the block store. They're backed by the way. Okay, so this is the main event. We're at the main event already. Yeah, it's nine o'clock dude. Oh, you don't want to fight? We will. We didn't miss it cause it was on the, uh, the prelims. But a Sun Sal vs. Dot. Miralis kid from a world series of fighting. Oh, what happened? The Sun's out. Beat them real and I split decision. Some people, yeah, we're up. People think Mariah's one, but a sense of beat him. Wow. Interesting. Marlon Moraes in my opinion, was the best hundred 35 pounder in the world outside of the UFC world series of fighting though.

Speaker 3:          01:30:06       Well, no, but he's really elite. If you look at his skill set and the way he moves and who he's training with, Ken, retrain, Mark Henry, Frankie Edgar, Edson Barboza. I mean that's his camp. Everyone is so high on a man. I always, I'm high on to the hype machine til you get to the EOC man to beat people. You're right. But I mean it's his first fight in the UFC and the son's first fight. But it should be though you're, you haven't lost since 2000 like for some shit. True. But if you are the UFC, if you're, if the UFC, someone says, look Brendan Schaub, we're tired of running this. Take care of this. Wouldn't you want to build them up? I would want to build up Marlin. I wouldn't want to, I would let everybody know how to get my highlight reel when yeah, me too. Cause his striking so elite, he was not bitches out and they need a new content.

Speaker 3:          01:30:48       Exactly. You put him in there with a guy who's, he's a monster, a monster and he's not that exciting. Yeah. You put them in there with a good hundred 35 pounder who tests them. But you know what man, that's how guys lose. And that's why you find out who they are. I mean that's what happened. Sergio Pettis, right fought Alex Cause Sarah's they through right to the wolves. And because Sarah's chokes him out and you realize like, okay, like you got some shit to learn kid. Yeah you're fucking talented. But Hey, try to frank kegger a year and biggest thing, uh, you know, uh, who do you have in this fight? Because you tend to be scientific about your pick. Man. This one's so tough to pick cause it Joe say it's so tough to, it's fucking Josie all though. But I just for yourselves Max Holloway's time, I feel like his box and he's bigger Max. Holloway's very smart and he's very, very like fluid with his movements. He moves in and out really good. He stays in the outside, he'd do anything. Here's the question, but how's he going to deal with all those leg kicks? Big Question. And it goes to the ground. People forget all those up fucking world champion on the ground. Although built cold, he beat [inaudible] in a regular Jiu Jitsu match. Everyone forgets about his grappling.

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       He's such a beast of a striker. Ways that can be trouble for Holloway cause just wants to fucking strike. And I think a lot of it depends on like where is Aldo at mentally. Well he just kept off the Frankie Edgar fight. He looked fantastic. But before that was talking about retirement remarry, retired, true play soccer. That might've been an asshole is all in though Max. Always all in. What else is in trout max? Max Hallway in a Steve Bay is these guys, they just run their camps like he's not in that some super camera. Why is he holding a British flag up when he's from Hawaii? You son of a bitch. That's the Hawaiian you. Oh my God. Even know if he had been in Hawaii. Can Can we meet? Meet with Mike for that. You never been to Hawaii? [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:32:40       Shit. Never. Never. Australia and never who? I had never sat down there. Fuck everywhere. I've been to all those email. When you talk all this shit about traveling to come to my world, I will probably try to top track one tune in tomorrow night. Yeah. Don't talk travel when Henry Rollins don't feel like a townie. God, that guy's been around, hasn't it? You know what he does every year? Picks a spot on the map. It go like that. Bali causes far as travel agent. What can we were going on? Bali. He just flies out to Bali by himself with a laptop and a camera pair of underwear. Toothbrush just lives there. That's good denture boy already do the same thing back. Ari went super deep. You wouldn't even deeper. He went for four months. Ours like, I'll show you much. I'll shoot over the wrong.

Speaker 2:          01:33:25       If you're looking for why fight and your destination, you're not trapped. Ari Shaffir stressing the fuck your Wifi. Fuck your phone. If you really want to travel, really can't. You've travel with a funk. I travel all the time and I like, I'd rather stay home. Once you travel to a thousand cities, you realize it's an illusion. Everyone's trying to travel to where I live. People are coming from Australia and I'm going to fucking Tahiti, French brother. You're walking through the airport and you see the destination, the be all end all, some dude's feet on a fucking bad ass beach. That's, that's the the goal. And then when you get there, you realize, wait a minute, that cutting off, they framed off like the people trying to sell you a fucking a crocodile unloading [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          01:34:25       Dot. That's right. Dot. I went to Thailand. I go, I'm going to go to the desert of fucking island on Thailand, and everyone said, yeah, you can. I go where they go, you need to fucking take a cap. Three hours jumped in a cab, three hours I'm gone. And then we finally get to go, what are the islands? Oh, you want to go to the island? Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking, I don't give a fuck how much it costs. It's just go. It's cheaper. If you go on a big ferry to this island or you could take a speed boat to go fucking speed boat and let's go, boom. I'm video taping. Everybody wants to speak. I want to go on this fucking ion that I see at the, I see him all the time. I don't give a fuck. I'm getting book money and Shit.

Speaker 2:          01:35:02       I don't give a shit. Fuck Thailand nonstop. I go, I'm going to go on a fucking island. You get there, boom, and there's 200 other people there and there's like snack bars and shit. The secret is the island. There was a Tracy, it was a trick. I spend all day finding this fucking I did. I was on a speed boat thinking they were going to take me to this island and he remembered I was going to eat alone. Beat boy Jason from England. The mole Deeves got to go to the mall. Deeves Jesus Christ. Hey, did you see Josie Aldo in Brazil? He has a restaurant. It's just American burgers in Brazil. Really just cheeseburger. It's called famous burgers that's ridiculous. Famous and he sells cheeseburgers. Hey man, is that cultural appropriation? Because a bunch of chicks got roundly Hartland. These girls got ran out of Portland because they were white and they were making burritos.

Speaker 2:          01:36:02       Yeah, because the United States is called the appropriation. That's how you get better at and I don't want a white girl making my burrito. Brian's about to go Fox News on us here. I was a Korea, Korea. They got a Mexican joint curry. They play fucking Mexican music making the Burritos, make it Mexican food. If we ever do a fight companion that's like in Europe or something like that. It's on the weekend. I got to take you guys to a real legit Mexican joint down the street. Do they have like, yeah. Okay, here's a super legit, you order for us is a super legit Mexican joint down the street where like every, all the, all the TV is in Spanish. All the music is Mexican. The beep of Bailey speaking you could barely order, you'll be the only you and I in him will be the only English speaking people in the room. It's fucking tremendous. Totally eat. So like girls Muto on the weekend. Ooh, I can't stand the legit minuto. Hey, why did these guys all have Bahrainian on what's going on over here? Super Skeptical eyes guys. What's going on with the Guardian Angels?

Speaker 2:          01:37:08       That makes shit like I was raised with the Mexican like no it wasn't. We didn't go. We went to Mcdonald's. When my mom, we're like, we're going to all those ram going to Mexican restaurants. Yeah. Yeah. It's two d. He looks tremendous. Like physically, dude, he looks as good as he's ever loved her. That looks like, although when he fought Chad Mendez, when it first, what are you saying? It looks fantastic. It looks like he's motivated. I'm not saying shit about steroids bro. It looks like a cheeseburger. Then say Shit Eddie. I didn't say shit but just by asking what he meant, he looks tremendous. That was cute. I will squeeze sale is very strict I think for the good, for a guy like Aldo. Well who's been the champion besides Conor McGregor? There's only been one ever 145 pound champion in the UFC. That's that guy you're looking at right now. So with a guy like that, I think many times it's a battle of motivation.

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       Yeah. I mean he's so dominant and he's been in the game for so long. And here's the crazy shit. He's only 30, unbelievable all the years that Joe's, although has been dominating and you think about it, I mean there's the guy who beat Frankie Edgar right first time and then beats them again the second time. Maybe even cleaner, maybe even better. Right? Think about all the people that if I do the Chad Mendez fight the second fight, a war, uh, the more common toma, but that was also when he was having a hard time making that weight. That was when we did that press conference the day before the fight and it was the day of the weigh ins and he could barely be on the ds because he was so weakened by the weight cut cause he hadn't weighed in yet. I think all go. I mean the crazy thing is he's always going to be judged by that Conor McGregor fight she's picked up, which it's kind of crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:38:51       I don't judge him for that. Fuck that. But it is what it is, but you kind of have to higher profile. Finer showed that a guy can come in at both guys. Talented is Connor can come in and first of all fuck with his head with Connor. Absolutely did get inside of his head, create a lot of stress for me and a lot of pressure forcing a rush and then Conor just relaxes fuck slides out of the way and drops that left hand bomb on them. Here's a question for you guys. He solved the puzzle. What happens if Holly comes there and merge some of the first round with his striking, then it's going to really taint his legacy. Here's the, was never fought any really, really good striker set for Conner. Uh, Holloway. Thinking more. What happens if Aldo kicks the shit out of his legs and has him hobbling and Roblin really early and winds up stopping him?

Speaker 1:          01:39:36       Do you have another Conor fight and we just go up to 55. Does he go up to 50 shit cause he wants to see Dana had Dana goes just to get him to commit to this. I have to have a serious talk with Mike Connors. Never going to fight. You got to move on. Like that's never happening. It's so crazy. Connor makeup fucking hunter. Do gillion dollars fighting Floyd and then come back and take on a fight against Joseph. You're right, but is a guy that just fought Eddie Alvarez a year ago. Right. And you've got to remember the result of what happens with Mayweather is huge like Mayweather. But let's just say that on the off chance that may, whether just just, just merch, some it just doesn't get hit. Not even once. And after that Connor's going to come back with a fury. Yeah. He's gonna come back with the theory to the UFC and say, fuck boxing. I'm going to come back and this is my sport.

Speaker 1:          01:40:29       If he makes it to a decision, he looks tough. He won't be tainted. It all depends on what happens. If he loses super played with, he's going to come back to the UFC with a fury. But if he goes to the decision, like you were saying, it's a win for him and it's close right at the top time when for us, no he not. Even if it's, there's no way Connor would ever let Floyd survive. But hold on it. If they had a five round MMA fight, let's all agree Floyd Mayweather would never fucking survived despite a chance in hell. They would need, there's there's, there's a chance, there's a very, very, very, very not unlike chance that he reimbursed. You have to bring you guys to the attention of the great no choice. We have to watch this fight and give it the respect it deserves and listen, settle down. No, I won't settle down because this is a very Cyril, depends on what kind of take down training yard take down defense training. Floyd Mayweather. Mayweather puts himself through the delusional kind of training or the real legit take down. It's good point. That's a good point. Cause they go, do they go for 50 74564505454 if you're sinking, it's one of the best matches for the year. If not the best feeling each other out.

Speaker 1:          01:41:44       How nervous are they built? Max Holloway looks very smooth and relaxed. So does, although everybody looks good. No one's doing that. Then I just want to see Holloway's answer for those lake cake. Well, the thing is Holloway's very clever. He's not going to rush in man. Like you see the way he fought, Jeremy Stephens mean he adapts. So we fought cub Swanson. One of the more interesting things about Holloway's because he talks, you know he's like a cool Hawaiian kid. Like people kind of sleep on that. Like they think of Hawaiians is being like fun loving like Surfing Party and people. You don't just mean j pen. Yeah, I know what I'm saying. I know, but there's something about like the way he talks almost something about, it's almost like you'd think he's just so nervous right now is BJ telling them are coming back? Yes. You're still fighting, fighting fucking homeboy.

Speaker 1:          01:42:32       Dennis Seaver and Dennis was doing too much. Bj can still have some awesome fights, but Yahya was just not the right match up. Hey, hey, this, although look like his himself right now or is he look nervous? Oh he looks perfect. Nothing's happened right now. He's just moving. See He is probably aware of that. Max Holloway wants him to commit and Max wants to counter. Max Is Taller, longer fighter and he's also, max is very good at not loading up. If you ever watch max hallways fights, he throws things very precise for the most part me and he'll load up if he can, if he can get away with it. But he's like by attrition, he's just very technical with his striking. He doesn't have a lot of super straight. Yes, exactly. Straight punches. He doesn't have a lot of fat and its movements and because he's a long tall guy that makes up for it means so much. He's got long tall, which is great and then he also has like super efficient movement. He's hard to hit. It's hard to hit. Yeah, he's really hard to get like a clean punch out. Super hard to hit any, he's fucking smart. Max Holloway's fight Iq is very high, super high, and they crazy doesn't come from the super camp either, but he just a holy book. He clipped all the right there with that left hook and he also knows how dangerous all those leg kicks are. So right now,

Speaker 7:          01:43:43       oh shit. Oh Shit.

Speaker 1:          01:43:49       Oh my gosh. They all know how those are higher shit on fire. Oh my God. Couple Lion. Oh my God. She's see, forget, forget how good. Although I remember when he hit Chad Mendez with the Duchy with that left hook to the body of that right leg kick and you watch them do it and you go, oh Jesus. Max Holloway weathered that storm. Whether that fucker he did cheese, his eyes are wide open chat. Should we come back any now right off the suspension? Yeah. Do you know what his suspension was for? No. Well, no. It was for something that he used for psoriasis or some shit. They test the Shamira. There's something in some psoriasis medication that makes you piss hot new. I sound like a fucking Alpha male apologist right there. Don't I? Shit. PDS. No, Brendon, no. Thrive. Even though Chad Mendez could jump out of a fucking five foot pool and he's only five foot seven. He's, he's a, he is a freak, super freak athlete.

Speaker 1:          01:44:52       But for real, that is what he said. And I believe him. I cared my, he does have it. I know he does it. Have these like a lot of photos with it where you could see it on his skin. And I know that steroids are a way that uh, the handle that shit, but if you just put that on the thing, you might be all right. G h our PS, what it was before it came out of, he had no idea what it was. Man Does explained to them. The test results came back. They told me I tested positive. I was like, I don't even know what that is. Bunch of research sucks. I love Chad. It says Roy is used to treat plaque psoriasis, skin condition he's been dealing with for years. Fuck. So it seems legitimate Chad. Yeah, he's fucking, you sought a relaxed. Yeah, but his God do Max Hein got take it? Yeah. He called Max Holloway. Dung them back. This is fucking, Ooh. I'll tell you what does a huge speed advantage on all those sites. Although, so goddamn explosive. He's so good at closing the gap, man. Like you remember that Mendez knee, he landed in their first fight. Oh my God.

Speaker 8:          01:45:50       Ooh.

Speaker 1:          01:45:52       I wrote, I'll never forget calling the Uriah faber fight. Got Uriah Faber fight was one of the most horrific displays of leg kicks. Worst thing in the world. Who are, I said he wanted a faint. He was trying not to faint from the pain. That's what he said. How tough is Uriah toughest? The toughest. I didn't [inaudible] Hall of fame. Never quit. Now Tie sky. We broke both his hands against her. Fucking Mike Brown kept fighting and kept fighting. Nobody tougher than that guy, but you don't get tougher.

Speaker 8:          01:46:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:19       Did first round first he documented the damage to his leg. Oh my God. Oh, backs hall with the math. That doesn't work on Josie. What would it worked? So there's something in psoriasis that shows up in the head of the treatment for psoriasis, something in the treatment that shows up. Man, that'd be a good idea. I had to get on some juice of, hey listen, go get it dyke. Go get a prescription for this stuff. So right away that was brilliant. But I cured my psoriasis. I have plaque psoriasis and I cured. I don't know what happened, but I just, you're sucking a lot. You could do steroids sucking. Strange. John's out 12 and then no. And then I heard you were sucking Dick stopped eating, uh, taking a touching cow, dairy. And uh, there's this book you ever read that book called the plant paradox about lectins. Really good book about psoriasis. Yeah. Well there certainly the bone psoriasis, but if you had psoriasis like he did, that's a reason to read it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:47:28       It literally these recommended no, no, it literally, I get up my shades, I get on my legs shorts. So we all agree. We all agree the Boldo one, that first round, fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. Right? Yeah. That book number 10, eight two. He looks good. It looks good. Cool. Oh, fucking sneaky. Left Hook to the body, man. Although one of the best ever, ever, ever still that sneaky left hook to the body is no joke. And he follows it up with that right leg kick a lot. And by the way, he hasn't thrown any of them yet. I know. Not One, no, he doesn't want to one hobby. But that's the same thing that happened with Frankie Edgar. See a lot of people anticipate the idea that all those going to try to take them to get some serious fucking hands. And when he knows he's not going to kick you but you think he might keep you, then it opens up his hand.

Speaker 1:          01:48:23       She has it too dude. And His hands are no fucking joke because he's so much faster. The Holloway, the Tude, all those hands are like lightning. He's, he's been talking lately. I mean I would like to find out how serious he is, but he's been talking about lately about possibly one day fighting and pro boxing. That's not out of the question. Oh my God, he's going to 55 I think probably for me at 45 let's be, well, I mean who knows, man. I mean, he seems to be this. If he makes it through five rounds looking like this, we've got to shut the fuck up cause he made 45 and he's like, oh my God, doesn't matter. He's looking fantastic and less. They can make a case for him to fight Mcgregor. He 55 they should. Yes. If 55 deep supercars never coming down to 45 for him.

Speaker 1:          01:49:09       But I would feel like if I was, if I was all though, look, you have to be co undeniable. Oh my God. And at 30 years old, he can become undeniable still. He's still, I mean to us, to the hardcore fans, he's undenying undeniable. But in order to sell that big paper view that would make Connor want to catch her breath, get your revenge. He's got a merch. Everybody. Yeah. He's got to become this guy like Gennady Golovkin like we're to the point where like Canelo had to fight him. Everybody keeps talking about Golovkin go up and go walking. Oh good. What happens if Josie Aldo came up and fought fucking cubbies or Tony Ferguson worked them crazy. Connor almost forced to crazy. Yeah. It's talking shit. Yeah, and Merck and Tony. I'll tell you that much. I knew you were going to say that. I'm just saying. Oh No, it's too much. Oh no, he's missing. I feel like Tony is so fucking durable and so nasty. Just like such a natural fighter. He is to be so game, but also super smart. Super Skillful and disciplined is, fuck. Tony's a handful for anybody. Anybody, anybody. I need to see him in fucking could be fine. And I know, man. You know what Tony should just ask him like, hey man, what do you weigh? 65 let's just fire you. Don't die. Don't die.

Speaker 9:          01:50:31       Oh, oh

Speaker 1:          01:50:35       punches. I don't have any tag. I'm actually, oh, oh man. It's beautiful to have that. Very best can not a whole lot of kicking folks. Cause I didn't just say as a phrase is going to catch her right hand if he kicks. Although I mean, I'll tell you what though. Max is showing his fight Iq man, he's, he's showing his fight Iq click how he's stretching those arms out in front of them. He's, he's giving that doubt. Good. Connor is he'd beat both these dudes. Yeah, but also like you see how he's doing that? First of all, he's doing it totally legal code head. Oh God. With the right. Again, this is crazy. Hey Connor, beat him to with a torn knee, by the way. I don't want to hear about that. Oh, body kick Dan, they're going off now. Ooh Man. Strong kick to the body.

Speaker 1:          01:51:20       Bags back. Holy Shit. We'll fight. What a fight Matt want that Max has a motherfucking savage was all though, man. You know what? If you take away that one punch by Connor is the best ever. He's pampered. Found number one crazy. I would say it's crazy. Did take that, but he did take that hit ain't done a bit so you know what it is, man. It's like here's a puzzle to every fighter. The question is did he seal that puzzle problem up that little hole that Connor founded? These seal that up. Any fights kind? We won't know. Damn it. They have to fight. That could be fine. If you were the head of the UFC, would you be like, listen, we got to make this happen boys? No, I let you do. I would have Conner probably fight GSP forced on him fight Florida. GSP want people to be educated. I want Oh, nice jam man. I want people to feel about sites and the way we feel about fights. You know what I'm saying? I hear you. I got one people

Speaker 9:          01:52:24       hands up. Hands down. Oh.

Speaker 1:          01:52:33       Oh Man. Slash bitch slapped him. Oh Shit. Oh well you be careful. Max was trying to give them the up and I'll know. Turn his back. So Max lost a psychological war there. He gave a thumbs up to do on his back to him. That's not good, right? Max Holloway's that guy though, you think? Oh, uh, yeah. I mean probably right. If you had a guest, he's down. He's down for sure. It's clean. That's quick. Clean. He looks good. I love it. I love it. I love it. And look and see that. Oh, he gave the thumb to his back. Never win a case. You gotta be quick Paul. No fucking cheese. And you've got a double and you meet might need to walk towards him after that. Yeah, right. Yeah. You gotta you gotta you might come up with a game plan. No stool in between rounds now. Yup. No, no, it's dangerous is, although he's got high level chokes. Oh yeah, man.

Speaker 1:          01:53:48       I'm not mad. I thought about, he's Jujitsu going on here at all. I'm going to and mustache bodied up in this great head. Mr. Steal your girl at that picture. Right? Okay, so here's the question. We're in the round three now, right? It's four 44 max down to the speed I would say. Right? If you had to look at this scorecard, but interesting rounds, right? The Max has got his both guys who've gotten things off, but all though it looks fucking sensation, the second rounds will inch in the first round. I was like, well, mixed bucket span and please make a tee shirts. You're crazy. I was interested in the first round. I'm saying that first round though, Max really got outclassed. I don't think there was something that was a big long period. The beginning of where was waiting for somebody to move true and then although eventually got the best of the exchanges, he's just showing some really nice levels trying to get them back kicked back to what the, Oh nope.

Speaker 1:          01:54:43       He's letting him out. Oh my God. This is some, oh, here's the other thing you got. How many wars? All those already been in a real fight. They took a lot out of them as the Chad Mendez thing though. I mean, and also Connor, he's had to Ricardo, Ricardo, lamas, fight lamas had him on his back and he's punched him. Dominic [inaudible] crazy, but he was on antibiotics when he was a shit's getting knocked guide yet. Brendan, please both of them all with that. Sweet. Neat. I know. I don't know. I'm hating on all though. I don't get it. Oh, I max the wind for some reason. You know what? One of the best things that's ever happened at a being a commentator is learning how to appreciate just a performance. It's got favorites. I always had favorites, man. Always when I was early. Right. I try

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       not to now, but like if somebody that I'm friends with like of cowboy fights, oh, it's the worst. It's hard. It's hard for me. Very, very hard for me to call. Your fights were the hardest I've ever had a call. Really hundred percent so hard as I've ever had a call. So you have to like decide like, oh, oh my God. Oh, he's hurting. It's not over yet. Oh my God. Oh my God. Hello?

Speaker 2:          01:56:15       Oh, she'll grappling going on right. Tagged him again. Oh, let him up. I'll do is let them hire street. Oh my goodness. Make him get up Max and knocked him out. Oh, what heart? Heart. Heart is right heart by Aldo to survive this. He's too his Jujitsu, but side your trolls. Look at this alive. Oh Shit. He's so battered, man. Oh, Halloween. Oh my goodness. No more burger joints. Oh fuck man. Dude. He might, you never know what the fuck it now I know. No more burger joints. Think Max is trying to sneak out the back door. What did you get to try and do is use. Oh, he's showing under the chin. He's got it. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God, Dude.

Speaker 2:          01:57:22       This dude is hurting a lot of time. Oh my God. What's rough is that, oh, that's a big job. And he knows what he's doing. Oh, head arm. Drag it all the time. The wrong, right. Arm's the wrong spot. Oh, well this is, if he just pours it on right now, he's going to stop. Come on. No, no, no, no. Oh my goodness. He's defending. Oh my goodness. Get the arm. Get the arm. Does a cover up. Cover up now what now? What is it he's going to say? Defend Yourself. Defend your no, GC and I'm good.

Speaker 5:          01:57:56       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:57:56       I often hear that last fight, but when I shut up and yet, oh, oh wow. Oh my gosh. Oh my God. Holy Shit. Hawaii finally gets the rural champ. God Damn fucking Hawaii. Holy Shit. Max Holloway. You know what, man? Aldo, he's shaking his head because he still wanted to be able to fight and it's a referee's called the stop, the fight, and he, he's very upset about that. He was stuck, but man, it seemed legit to me. That was a legit stoppage. It seemed legit to me. I see my intelligent, oh, you know it's legit. Eddie had

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       cruelty. Oh yeah. You think it's legit, right? Yeah, I do. Yeah, I would. I would imagine there could be. You have to protect the, the road I liked. I liked that. That big John let it go that long. But you rarely see he took a beating for like two minutes straight. Yup. Yup. Came back, man. You got tagged so hard, man. She sees what he goes through, man. What an incredible fight. Madison. Oh, let him jump in the fucking flag flag, man. No, there's this family that flew all the way from Hawaii. My where's the rock? What the fuck up man? You got a world champion in Hawaii like Cleveland. We got a world champ. Cleveland. We got to world chesty pay. That's right. That's one of my all time favorite. A guy who just won the title things is steep. Emile chick did Cleveland's, he said he ran out onto the cage. He couldn't believe it after he knocked out his last fight.

Speaker 1:          01:59:51       Kelly. Right? You like him? You like machine gun? Kelly say something nice or say nothing at all. Hey listen, there's a serious movement in Cleveland. Yeah, well listen, Cleveland is a, I had a great fucking time. We did a UFC in Cleveland just a little while ago and I did. I did a show there in Cleveland. I had a fucking great time, man. They're fun, Dude. That clip that city's coming back to life. Hawaii, Whitney lucky and come back. Let's look at this big bang. Boom. Come on. Sign drops him with that right hand. Nothing fancy. Is it the one to the one, two. Beautiful timing though, man. Beautiful timing. Look at this. Look at that. Oh my timing with that right hand is perfection. He's on top of him dropping bombs on him. There was a couple of times in the fight where it looks like it looked like Aldo went out, but his will, his will and his need to fucking get through this.

Speaker 1:          02:00:43       Like right there, Bang. Come on man. Is to be Josie Aldo once in that kind of freak fight with Conor to beat him like this. I mean, Max Holloway beat the shit out of him. He beat him in a way that no one's ever beat him, matched his best and kept going to him and he beat him in a way that no one's ever beat him. Connor only beat him cause he caught him. Max Holloway beat him down and beat him. Beat him down. Got through the gauntlet. How big is that tall? We can be Hawaii and fighting his fucking dry aunt. I've been singing happy as Bj Penn and own that island. I've been singing that kids praises for a long time. He came into the UFC super poor Joseph. Oh yeah. The background holding that devastated like it's his man.

Speaker 1:          02:01:33       Hey Man. Hey Man. It is what it did. Did a great job. He's a great fighter. It is what it is. This is fighting and people win and people lose. And the the sport ultimately, it depends upon the sort of fights. It depends upon these all time greats like Aldo facing some guy who's got the solution to what that guy presents. Yup. And that's what although did tonight. How do you mean? He went out there with all of his championship medal and he laid it all on the line. He fought his best and his puzzle got solved by the new breed. Let's hear, let's hear what he has. Both these guys give us some volume cause I know how to be a beat. Him with a torn ACL title wrapped around it a long time ago still. It's incredible.

Speaker 5:          02:02:19       Diploma. [inaudible] Jesus Christ. Second of all got, I got a his son at home. Maybe Russia. You got another phone baby.

Speaker 1:          02:02:31       Josh Holloway. Great man. I love it. George Rush. Saint Pierre Inspired Nasser. No. Nah, he's Hawaiian.

Speaker 5:          02:02:39       You now though. You're on your phone, don't you man. You guys bike brands. I love you guys. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:02:49       John, powerful shout out to Brazil. Always a good move. Yeah, but they're boring. They're pulling them. Well of course they're booing them. They feel like the fight shouldn't have been stopped because their guy got beat. You're smiling that Brazil started a little slow tonight. Then round three when you've got slow, why you gotta bring up Oh shit.

Speaker 5:          02:03:16       Sarah, you had been away.

Speaker 1:          02:03:23       What? My 50 games. He read the decision, right? Bang. I'm a smart QC. Hawaii. Wow. That's Tom UFC. Hawaii. We'd very tough shit. I don't know. I don't travel overseas, but I will fucking fly to Hawaii in a heartbeat. I will that make it happen. How about we do a joint show up in that mother fucker? We miss a show. Yeah. How about we do a fight companion in Hawaii if they do a UFC in a, why we all fly out to Hawaii and do some sort of a fight camp painted, you know Hawaii. So even if I don't work in that, we still there. Let's be in Hawaii. Yeah. Let's see if we can get a fight. Companion booth. Let's just cut the shit. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:04:13       I can do a viking penguin at the show. This is, this is what I'm thinking. This is the kind of commentary I liked doing. So what we need to do, because you need to treat the fight companion like an embassy. Like we have our own special country rules slash just put us right in their life. Yes. I want to see bringing Jamie Hall and let us do commentary. You don't have to listen. You got other options. You can listen to the Tories. You can listen to the corner options, right. You can tell daddy shops, you can listen to it in Brazil. You can listen to it in Portuguese. Is that green screen? I think I find sweet. Like can you just sit down with Tom White and have a fucking conversation? We're going to be better one of those suites instead of ring side. If we did it I see four season and watch it. We could totally or we can just keep doing it for me but we're not getting enough playing for [inaudible] here. Did you imagine if they collapse of that in fight companion, if that was one of the options like you get fight companion or in a fight pass you get fight companion, you don't eat. The ratings would go up and fight. Kiki contacted you that he decided that it's not a good idea. Come on man. Really started long ago. We have talked about on the fence head of files.

Speaker 1:          02:05:45       We may keep those motherfuckers away. Is 42,000 people watching right now that many. Is that a record? I don't know, man records. Alex Jones, right? Yeah. It was like 60 songs. Jesus, I forget. People here can watch. That's a lot of the stadium watching. How about Derrick Lewis? Mark Hunt. Look at that fight I got. I should have done my hair. Bronson, Daniel, Kelly, Daniel Kelly might just be able to beat everybody. There's something weird about that dude. He has some weird old man thing going on. I can shoot dope thing, man. The competitor thing. Double knee braces. Right? It's crazy. These are fucks up. I asked him about it after the last time I interviewed him after a fight and he said if he wasn't fighting he would get surgery. Fuck he said, but as long as they let him tape the fuck out of his niece. Dude, he's like a mummy. All judo guys. But like usually judo people I've built, all their needs are their needs, their needs get jacked. God Damn Max Holloway so long as punch fast little champ, man Holloway would that I fucking long punch. But although countered them not, oh look at that woman's amazing. Although countered him and hit him some real big shops.

Speaker 1:          02:06:49       That's how good mass, you know, it's crazy. Some people thought maybe cubs swats. We'll get the next shop up. Max fucking annihilated cub. Yeah. Well, you know what? Here's what's important about this fight. It's not just at Max. Holloway did this, but that Max Holloway did this to a Aldo Max Holloway left. No doubt in anyone's mind. This is the best 145 pound fighter on the planet earth. If you look at how all though God pass Frankie Edgar, you look at it, although God passed everybody except for Connor, and then you look, you know the car's not coming down to one 45 more. That's the motherfucker right there. And he made an ecstatic tonight. Holloway. Frankie, you're well, hey gift you then what in the world, don't you think that your Yahya Rodriguez has two forks in the road, right? There's the fork of unrealized potential. So he comes into this fight.

Speaker 1:          02:07:39       He's got Bj Penn behind him, right? He'll nylon. It's Bj Penn. He hits Bj Penn, one of the greatest of all time hall of Famer with a three 60 round kick to the neck. That just doesn't happen right? Then he gets murked by frank steroid and so he has, yes, he's not ready, but he has two paths. Like either he can learn from how Frankie was able to take him down and beat the fuck out of him and then figure out a way to never let that happen again or be overwhelmed by the pressure of that loss and the circumstances and the sorrow depends on his mindset. Also depends on match. Looks like. I like [inaudible] Holloway. That's a great, very good fats hallways and I can take him down. Sorry. It just striking for Stryker of both 45 hours. That's a great fight Gavin. Almost. It'd be damn near even money.

Speaker 1:          02:08:28       I bet. Yeah, but I guarantee you, you're going to see Max Holloway taking people down to, I think that dude is smart as fuck, but he keeps adding to his, he's not going to take Frankie now. You're right. Their buddies from Kratos listen, extra foot reach it. But Joel, there's really no grapple. A lot of grapplers left, right Frankie, you're right. Frankie's the big threat. If you're a guy who can't stop and take down the number one threat is Frankie and the white, give him a year. Why would you give him the one guy he eating your own young. You're eating your young. You say that you believe in protecting fighters. You get a guy like Jon Jones, Jon Jones youngest ever does a flying knee in his opening move against Shogun. Right? But look what he did. But that's what makes those guys, that's a hard case though because a couple of good fights.

Speaker 1:          02:09:13       But that hard case because you don't give him to a grappler like Frankie knowing that the guy cannot stop taking all time, gave him time to develop and give them the other guys who are very exciting strikers cause he's, he's a star. John before he won the title, had some very good fights, but it's real good fights where after he got the title four, which showed Brandon Vera cradled Ryan banner that Dante Tez fight with w w the Stephan Bonner fight was one of the most interesting ones because he showed up creative. It was, and he shows single-leg spinning elbow. He showed up creative. He is, and he showed up. Fluid is moving is, and it just showed that he was on another level. He never got that. But also, yeah, you're like, he had a split decision win over Bruce Leroy. Right. Very good point. And then they're like, oh here's Frankie Uyghur.

Speaker 1:          02:09:59       It's like God. Yeah, it's a very good point because I feel like he felt so good after the Bj Penn fight. He felt like he had arrived and he's like that Alex, cause Sarah's fight is out the window. I'm fucking past that now. And he might have been, but he wasn't. There's just this disease levels now. It is buddy. Everybody that knows anybody in any kind of martial art, whether it's boxing or wrestling or Jujitsu, there's always people who overestimate their proficiency. Pronounce sure. Get some more. Uh, you quit that earthy show. This is your fruity. That's your California. But the boys nine boys night, we're hanging in Italy. I'm fucking super impressive. Max Holloway, man. Super depressed him say frank, yet that's coming. There isn't the only 25. How old is Max Holloway? Now I want to say he got into the UFC when he was either 20 or 20 years in Hawaii, Hawaii together like fucking peanut butter and Jelly man.

Speaker 1:          02:10:56       They fucking love fighting. Cause Bj, Bj started that man. Dude, listen champ. Yeah, and a legit champion. Just beat who is arguably one of the great look I gotta say Conners the greatest 145 pounder of all time because he knocked out all the WHO's clearly, but it terms of like, who's got more victories? Of course it's all though body, the body of work. But the, the problem is, the ultimate question is, it's not, we're not doing MMA math here. You having two guys actually fight each other? So if you said like who the greatest of all time? Well it would have to be all go because he beat all these guys. No, no, no, no, no. Because the two of them fought and Connor murked up Corinna so you got to give it to him. Otherwise there's no other metric. There's no other metric other than a knockout.

Speaker 1:          02:11:37       What happened was is that it's the most important body of the sign with the flathead. Be penalize for beating someone easily. I mean like you beat them to easily say doesn't count. We had a really good lucky down, but this is what is in the locker room. They show him do the exact combo. Yeah. Like it wasn't like a freak, like oh my God, please show him step back, throw the exact cup and this is what's going to happen. Yup. Yeah. And they also showed him do that front leg side kick to the leg. It's nice. He created the distance. He's hopping in and out and he wanted to slide back and countered with that left hand. He hit it perfect. He called. He's the best ever. You have to say he's the best ever. Even if you never fights featherweight again. Why? Because he kao the best ever.

Speaker 1:          02:12:19       The real, the reality is all those the best ever. But Connor Kod, you couldn't say without the Aldo fight that Connor was the best ever. Cause you look at all the different people that both of them fall. You're like, wow, it's really close. It's really interesting. But within Wa, but although I was more fights, but then once they actually fight, which is all that, that's all it matters. All that matters. Not Mma match your right to competition. They file it is, I mean that, so you got to give it to the light and people will fight against it. No, because all those, the champion for so many years, you're 100% right. His body of work as much more impressive and there's always going to be an asterisk next to Connor because you know there was just this one time he fought for the title at one 45 k owed all though. Y'All be cool. Y'All be cool here, come get it. So it's really clear.

Speaker 1:          02:13:10       It's really clear. There are tied for the best guy in the shirt. And then what's the tie breaker? Oh, their fight. They got what happened in the fight? You decide, right? You know what? You know what's interesting? It's really simple, but sometimes like you'll get top ten's, you'll look at a guy who's number six and then the guy who was number eight knocked him out in the last fight. And you're like, what in the fuck is going body of work? That's crazy. I know. It was an upset. He got lucky. Like it says who when it got punches you in the face and wanted to punch you in the face and then punched you in the face. Where's the luck? We, what are you doing? He rolling. I caught him. But when Tom off hand that fats to be in the argument of the best ever liked for all though to be in the argument and from Mcgregor or for anybody.

Speaker 1:          02:13:53       John Jones, like just to be in the goddamn argument. Oh man, it's the best ever know what it was in fade or, or is it, um, Anderson Anderson? Who is it? Is it facing? Those are the two arms. That's the two argument. I'm always been in the Anderson. Kim Jones is in there. No, not yet. I think you still could because his body of work, he could, but there's so much, there's so many problems with that. So many problems with that. Off the field. Pick the OSP problem. You know, we were, he had a good fight, I think. I think you've performed well. Gets a really dangerous slick guy, but he didn't put on a show cave. Then Anderson Silva has the Damien Maia fight, the towel size, those horrible fights, favorite or had some insights to Anderson had those earlier. And then he started dominating people. And when you look at some of the crazy Anderson fights like the Forrest Griffin Kao, when you look at Anderson like motivated Anderson, when he's like in shape and the James Irvin, when he went up to two oh five jobs, I know it's true, but when you see him as an assassination, it's Vitor Belfort Vietor who named Mark Horton is price.

Speaker 1:          02:14:52       They talk TRT Victoria go through John Show Gun. You know what I'm saying? That's not true. It wasn't Trt v tour back then. No. Veto wasn't on TRT and became on TRT factory fight Anderson. He looked different when he fought Anderson. He was like, he didn't like John [inaudible]. Jack [inaudible] was Vito when he was 19 is that still considered DRTV for no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          02:15:19       He said that he was two 42 40 with a side of the picture. Sheriff Jim [inaudible] and I met his trainer way, way back in the day. We used to call them garden hoses. I remember him, I remember him 35 years old. Joe and I were looking at him. He was thinking he was Joe. And I remember the airborne memory, he was eating wars put. Of course he's eating out of a can of tuna at the airport and he and I were watching her and Joe goes like, this was looking at a good job. US, he is the color of aplomb cause crazy dude. You never seen anybody that he was, he was just a totally different, it's called pressure. It's supposed to be was like in everyone's corner. Anderson Silva's with a fanny pack and just call them garden hoses because we worked out with him once and a dude had garden hoses from Hanes. I think that was his, nick was his name growing and I think we might have mentioned it either. You and I are but, but it was, but yeah, he died. Yeah. Yeah Dude. And this is when too much gear. This is when Vito was in the Randy couture fight. So this was the, those days when Vito looked like a lion, it looks like a male line. Schuman, lion, like his neck started. Nobody had better training about

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       here. I just came straight down and he was just super jack when he fought Randy. He was like two 40 yes, he's fighting money. Any five now. Just stop and a tough lady. Five. Just stop and think of that. That is insane. I mean that's insane. Themed out garden hose down. No. You remember the other fist fight? Rockhold is Tiara TV? Do you remember? There's another fistfight. Here's a trivia question for Joe Rogan. There was a fist fight in the stands after [inaudible] lost to Randy couture. Do you remember who it was between? Um, was that the one between tank Abbott? Nope. No. Who Was it? Nope. It's how it was always getting. It was a fist fight between Gemma fee tourism mom and his girlfriend. Who's that dude? Dude's that Curtis? Yeah. Yeah. There he is. That's Mr. Hose. Oh, is that handles the dude across the shoulder?

Speaker 3:          02:17:27       Pull up is a go go big on his images. Good. Just, just, just, just does that, but that's him. Just go big. Make it big. Like close it. Sorry. Yeah. Look at the size of his fucking veins, dude. We'd be at the gym with them be like, well, how come we don't look like that? Because that doesn't even look like a human. That dude was so jacked. He's super nice guys, biceps, everything. If he right there, right with edit where his elbow is like, what is that? That's like, it's a keyboard, like a steroid that he took some stuff. He just fucking biceps right by the side of the steroids because they always say no one's died from steering. Know your heart. It can fuck with your lipid levels and everything we do. If you do it that much. God knows what he was taking pictures on cow blood.

Speaker 3:          02:18:08       He was taking crazy. People take a lot of crazy stuff. They also take insulin and apparently that's really dangerous in the kitchen. There's a lot of different stuff that they tell you. He took a lot of stuff. All of it is effective if you want to get to that fucking giant size, you know? I'm trying to get on man, I've got to contact him. We've been going back and forth. Is Dorian Yates. Ooh, that'd be fun. Fuck Cam man. He's going to be, he's going to be about July giant man. Openly. Yeah. It tells us dosages do says what he was doing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Talking about it. Still doing it now. Well, he does. He's on TRT now. Talks about that. Cause we had Phil, he thought he was Mister Olympia seven time Mister Olympia. And you go really? Like you can't like I want to get steroids. No, we don't humpy come on. Dorian Yates brings it up himself. He wants to talk about it. He's like, this is crazy. Like everybody should know what we're doing and there are no nuts. His credit, Arnold says the same thing, aren't it? Tells everybody about it too. Yeah. They were all there. I mean obviously there's no one way to achieve both sizes.

Speaker 3:          02:19:06       Yes. Terminators on this too. There's no way to achieve those sizes. If you're not taking something. He's kind of still doing something. All those pictures of her wants to be on steroids. Oh, you fixed now. He's in shape now to, Amy's going to have to terminate her ice off dad. You

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       guys know he had heart surgery. Yes. That's when he looked disgusting on the beach. That's what was going on. I mean, he had a lay lay low. Let his body were counseling him, especially alone in the hospital. If you don't work out, but he, he's bald. He's bald. Jack now. God. Holy Shit. Photoshop maybe. Right. That can't be real.

It's not that recent Gold's gym son. What he's been saying, what he's been saying is that he's, he's been working out with Franco Columbo and him and Franco Columbo travel around together and they work out together. [inaudible] Franco Columbo. Those dudes were the shit back in the day and the body and both of them are added again.

Speaker 2:          02:20:24       Well, both of them were on a fucking picture. Yes. There's a bunch of follow up. He could personally, he can blow up. Franco Columbo would do two things. One is he could go dip shit that's from that movie pumping and pumping iron and shit. He used to do dips with two girls hanging off his legs and he can blow up one of those old fashion water bladders. You know those ones you fill up hot water bath. He can, he can fill up like to the boys back hold on. Weekends. Franco Columbia could make it explode. God Damn, he didn't blow it up. He blew it up and made it pop and Jay z, he did it in like 30 seconds. That's how strong saying, just with his power, his lung power, he was one of the most powerful bodybuilders and he's one of the smallest. Yes. Power. It wasn't a big guy, please.

Speaker 2:          02:21:28       I was never going to jerk off on a guy I'm in most of the time. I'm not thinking about it. They go to a gym, they're like Lyft and people watch them. They just go to the gym together, man. Oh, that's cool. Like if you and me went to the gym together, they go to the gym together. Go guys. Two old guys fucking went at it could mean Callen went to the gym together. We're getting old bunny, but frankly we're on the way to those people. Yes, we are. Franco's not on any testosterone though. What are you talking about? He's hanging out with Arnold and he's, he's like, okay, well how many milligrams to bring up Franco right now? Nice. Had a question for you. Yeah, hold on. We've got two different conversations going on. I'm sorry. Gun to your head. Got a gun to your head and you've got to jerk off on anybody in man's face on the planet.

Speaker 2:          02:22:15       Who would it be? Donald Trump. No, hold on. So this is as long as long as that size. So it wouldn't necessarily be my favorite American, but I like what? He's not American, but don't listen to me. Look at me say no. Hold on. Absolutely not. Nothing but respect for Heather Hector love. I love Hector Lombard. I would never, he's saying because he don't even bring a gun to your head. You don't want to no, no, no, no, no. I will never, I would never, I would never splurge on a guy that I respected as a two level library.

Speaker 2:          02:23:05       I like Jude law. I know where you went with that. Now hold on. Johnny Depp. [inaudible] mother fuckers got to hold his hand and they'll get me in the eye and I have to go like this. I got to go. Hey listen man. I spent [inaudible] was the 50s movie was the 50s movie. What was it? Cold outside. It just got to go back to him and the outsiders. I'm 50 21 jump street, you know, tried to hate your but this moment because I'm 50 is it not shooting heavy? She got a baby bird. If you came on his face and he caught those teeth, you'd feel bad. Right? The snuggle t look at if you saw your own cup first just to look like Photoshop. Know Brian. He used to have terrible teeth, dammit. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          02:24:22       I think they actually added a shark tooth. Well that's him after braces. He had braces when he was like 40 that'd be braces in veneers. Yellow teeth were also off to one side. I want to know how he got, I want to know the story of how he got in. Is there a, is there a video out there? Scientology. How did he get in? Like what happened? That's a good question. I think somebody recruited them from a movie. He was good though. He was already at movies. He was the guy who made that happen on Scientology. There's like season for my podcast. She talked about it and you know, when I first met her, she was deep in it. She was with Kevin James, she was on king and Queens and that's when I first met her and he was like, she's a scientologist, was like, Woo. She's really nice. She's very cool man. That's just QT to mind. Control keys. That's all that is. Well, somebody figured out how to control people

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       long time ago. It's called come up with a set of rules and say that this is like someone's looking out for this set of rules, whether it's God or Buddha or creating mythology. Do is do that and people follow it. It's the stuff that, until they know nothing but reports of, uh, child abuse, it just gives a lot cheaper using colts. Yeah. It's one of the big problems with cults. Joey Diaz, his ex girlfriends was in a cult like when she was a kid and he, she said that, uh, the guy who was the head of the call molested everybody. Of course. Less it all the girls. Yeah. Molested. He wanted to fuck everybody's one. Yeah. It's all just, that's cool. Yeah. That's all these calls. That's what happened. Polygamy. Waco, crazy. David Koresh. That's the crazy thing. David Koresh. They shut that motherfucker shit. The down. We are allowing this to happen. It's like we want it to happen. It's like it's a CIA. Mk Ultra Express.

Speaker 2:          02:26:20       Well, what do you mean? Well, I realize, look at the time, let me feed the beast riders on the storm. I don't know shit. I don't know

Speaker 1:          02:26:42       how, and when you look into it, you got to look in the, look into it. I've been living into it. Think about this. Think about how crazy that religion is. Yeah. Think about that. Think about how it's allowed to survive and thrive. You seemed like Scientology even better. I'll do you one better. Scientology doesn't have to pay taxes. Hold on. I'll tell you, I'll tell you the kitchen, the facts, I'm not taking the actual fact. They organized a massive lawsuit campaign against the IRS. And they said that if you can say that all these different religions, whether it's Catholicism or Mormonism, Mormonism has very questionable backgrounds. More minutes was started by Joseph Smith who was a known con man. I mean Mormonism course. It's, yeah, there's, there's like he found it when he was 14 he said he found golden tablets that contained the loss work of Jesus and only he could read him cause he had a magic seer stone.

Speaker 1:          02:27:37       Like when you look at the actual, you're talking about a guy who we know the guy, right? So Scientology was like, well so fucking what if you can take that? If you'd take Mormonism, like why can't we get tax exempt status? And they said, no, fuck you. You're not a real religion. And they're like bullshit. If, if, if anything is a religion where religion and in that sense I support them. I don't think, I think all religions should have to pay taxes. But I think that if anybody gets a free ride, so I told you you should get a free ride. If you're going to have this goofy loophole, then they qualify. If Mormons get up to, that's what happened at he is massive lawsuits. It was the, and this is all you could find it. I saw it, I saw the ideal document. They filed a Shitload of lawsuits and the IRS was fuck you talking about going clear the gaskets, amazing books, amazing

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       doc. It's a great, the books even better. Great because it goes into the history of this big book. Everything's allowed to happen. The thing is no one can pay attention to everything. Everything is allowed to happen all the time and then once we find out that something's happening and it's like, okay, now what? You can't shut down a religion? Well, you can't shut down anybody's freedom of speech. If you have an ideology, your freedom of expression, your your ability to gather and talk, no shit. All I know is if, if I had a country to run, I would start. If I was running in the country, I would start colts and have mind control experiments with too, but I wouldn't have time in between negotiating oil deals and trying to figure out whether or not we should stay then NATO and prime it Paris climate control. I know what you're saying and you know in a way you're right, but no one has the time to do ever is not enough to micro manage the entire world business. Right. It's just there's, there's only so much shit you can let people take care of them. You could let people take care of themselves. Illuminati got key, got enough time for mind control experiments. There's too much shit going on. Well, they definitely have done some mind control experiments too. That's part of the problem around the country. I'm thinking of.

Speaker 2:          02:29:49       I'm saying Goodbye Comic Book Guy Writes Comic Books. I would definitely read who you're going to start a religion. You're going to start a religion. You're going to start and just, you're going to bullshit in this way and we're going to who? Who is right. I want to know from you and you better tell me my country at least 500 years old. The candy. Oh it's, you know it. You have a question, Brian, you got to tell me this, cause I know you know the fucking answer, but as a dictator hold other. I want you to ask your finger on the post. I want to know right now on this podcast who was running this country. I have no idea. Come on Bro. I don't know. Give me a little idea cause I know you got to fucking, I don't know Bro. You're out. You're playing dumb right now.

Speaker 2:          02:30:33       I'm going to guess, I'm going to guess based on circumstantial evidence. I'm going to Oprah. The guests, uh, educating guys, control the banks. That's, I don't know who would they be Roth trials. I Dunno. I could be wrong with that. Slippy Rothschild's could be a complete none of the application. That's an, I don't know. I looked up on the day in the Rothschilds like a family. Here's what's hilarious. It's 1 billion to like 70 trillion, 700 trillion, 700 billion or trillion number lays it there. The amount of money they own. It's either one a billion. Oh, a hundred percent surreal. Oh, 100% there's a family that owns all the banks. No. There is a family that has a considerable amount of money. They pass down from generation generation and these, these young, the Saturations, how much figured out how to connect in the real. We don't use it. We don't know. That's what they say.

Speaker 2:          02:31:31       They say between 1,000,000,700 zillion. Nope. Says 500 trucks. But do they even exist to the rob trials even exists? That could be a conspiracy. Can I say one thing? The Rothschilds are a hoax. Okay. Think about the Rock Charles. When, when you talk about the Ross, Charles and these different big families, if there's one thing in common, it's a hoax. Nope, follow me on this if you hear it. Nope. They're all Jewish. And by the way, if you look at their roots, if you look at the roots of these, a lot of these, a lot of these rumors, a lot of these rumors and conspiracies, they start in the the free mail, not to cams. And the ultra right wing camps and a lot of the antisemetic anti, you know the history that goes way back, that goes way back into Europe. That goes way back with the Nazi. So just be careful where these things come from. You'll find that there are roots. No, I know. I don't know shit. I'm on Youtube. Yeah, their roots sometimes starting really at off places. So you should read a book every now and then.

Speaker 2:          02:32:28       The guy who's had clear and the looming tower, two very good books. I Dunno. The plant paradox, which I'm reading now about food, very interesting. Benefits me to believe something unless I make money from it. Yeah. Idiot. You're a fucking idiot. You know, like what is, if I believe this dude, you could be fucking, your kids could be go to college if you want measurable results. If you just sign off and say you believe it, like uh, that's not what's going to happen. Is it illegal? If I don't believe it, well I get thrown in jail. No, then I don't want to. If I don't want to believe Shit, if it, if it doesn't hurt me I it shouldn't be such a big deal. That's you know, that's, I don't know what to believe man. I don't know if the Rothschilds are real. I Dunno if reptilians are real.

Speaker 2:          02:33:15       I don't know. Satanism is real. I don't know. Shit. One thing I'd say is learning, getting closer to the truth can be achieved by looking at all the independent lines of inquiry. All the independent lines come to one consensus to come to the truth is that you're trying to tell me exactly how to come up. I'm just saying generally I'm spelling in general cause I would never tell you to get closer. Come on. Come on man. I'm talking about Janet. Let me say this cause I think this is really important. One of the problems that I've had me personally I've had with any idea is that once I have an original idea, a, once I start looking at something a certain way, I become married to it. Yes. And I bet real problems with that. And the problem is half. It's confirmation bias. I understand. But I'm just saying I've had real problems with that. Like personally where I had to look at like what I believed and go, well why do I believe that and why? Why do I think, and there's been a bunch of times whether it's your big foot or Ufos or, I mean I've looked at the JFK assassination a hundred different fucking times. You know, there's been times when I said, well maybe Oswald got lucky me. Like people do get lucky. Like I, I've shot the first animal I ever shot. I shot at 200

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       yards and I probably shouldn't have had it dropped. I could have fucked that up. You know, you can, if you're aiming at something, pull the trigger and hit the president in the back of the head. It is possible. I don't think it did. It seems to me more like some other shit was going on. If you look at all the different pieces of evidence, but I don't fucking know man. And the problem with saying this happened, that happened, which I used to do all the time, is that you don't fucking know. You don't know. You don't know until you do know when you say you know, and you might be wrong, it becomes an ego thing. So you can speculate. Yes, you can get closer to the truth. She would approximate. So if you hear scientists, they always say it's so fascinating. Scientist start always with doubt and what they do is they always say if you really corner signs that say, well this is the most likely, uh, based on the data I've looked at are the literature I've read carefully.

Speaker 1:          02:35:07       This is the most likely possibility. It's really interesting to hear how they talk that way because like with global warming or anything, if you're not Kraus, uh, yes, it's across the house. Listen, I've had him on my podcast. I listened to both the podcasts you had with them and try to read some of his book. It was tough. But yes, I love book is rough dude. When he started to have to have a back age symmetry, when he was going to gauge symmetry and I fucked up by opening up my podcast, asking him to explain gauge symmetry. Now I know it's insane. I got, this is what I got some hole in your head. I got the, there's a web, there's an invisible web and we come into contact with w w we, we become mass, but we have to understand is skepticals we are of this shit.

Speaker 1:          02:35:46       These are the same motherfuckers they put together the large Hadron Collider, Sierra spinning Adams just slightly under the speed of light slamming, admitted to each other and recreating the very instances right after the big bang and they're doing that shit right. Crazy. There's a team of sign. How many sides does 130 countries? Thousands. Thousands. Guys, find out. How many of you guys all agree that Nikola Tesla was a great scientist? Oh, he's a genius. He was a genius, but you got to remember the Nikola Tesla lived in a world where he was so far ahead of the curve and there's very few people that were able to compete with them or even understand what he was doing. Do you know that if you go to youtube and you punch in Nikola Tesla hopes fraud, nothing comes up. That's amazing. That makes sense. Yeah. And that's also a guy lives 1920 on the planet dispute. Trying to say all that shit was bullshit. There's no, you go to youtube punching Nikola Tesla hoax fraud. Not One fucking video. There's videos that come up that saying, uh, something else was a hoax. Nikola Tesla approves it. Or you know, Nixon Nixon, Tesla proves hoax, but not one video of anybody ever say Nikola Tesla. I feel like, but yeah, but this is just the fact that you can take it or leave it. Put in Albert Einstein hoax fraud. Endless videos. It's a bummer. It was a free, yeah, it does videos. They're like, wait

Speaker 2:          02:37:15       a minute, it's an Albert was an Albert Einstein. Time magazine's man of the century. Let me stop. I thought he was the smartest man in a second. Let me just help you here. You're getting very dramatic. So let me stop for a second. If you put, if you put in Holocaust hoax, you'll get an equal number of them. I'm not talking about that. You know, if you put in Sandy Hook hoax, you're getting an equal number. You get it. You get a tremendous number of people that think that it's amazing. Well all sign on him. How about people that don't think that Richard Pryor was genius prior? Have you ever met a comic wants? It doesn't think Richard Pryor is one of the greatest of all time. They don't exist to videos of people trying to prove that he was wasn't the greatest sound, but I mean, look, I believe that snow melting on Nikola Tesla, I don't think that Einstein was a hoax dude.

Speaker 2:          02:38:06       Causation though. Shit, I'm not, I don't know nothing. All I know is there's nothing on Nikola Tesla doesn't mean anything, but there's thousands of Albert I you look into his life like, Oh, anyone besides business Tesla. Oh, does it have that? Is he the only guy at Thomas Edison? Thomas Edison was always accused of stealing the ideas of Nikola Tesla. In fact, Thomas Edison electrocuted an elephant in the middle of like, what was it, the World Thomas. Oh, Thomas Edison. Thomas Edison electrocuted a fucking elephants. There's video because he wanted to prove that alternating and direct current ACDC, which is Tesla's idea. There's video of analysis for an electric heater, not by Thomas [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          02:38:53       Thomas Edison did it. The reason why he did it is to prove what you tried to like. It was propaganda against Tesla's ideas, which are more advanced form of movable like he wanted, he wanted there to be alternating currents and test test lesson was a direct Einstein's. We're alive and kicking at the same time. Tesla, there's quotes. The quotes could be bullshit. You know Tesla comes from several dead. He thought Einstein was a fraud. That could be a phrase that I've heard. I've heard that shit. But there are quotes that can be bullshit of Tesla. There's, I keep, they keep popping up breaking even on it. Hold on, hold on. There's quotes. Test the quotes saying the theory of relativity is basically a joke. There's tests. Haha. No, no. What I'm saying is it could be bullshit, but it keeps coming up when they're no, we know that the theory of relativity is used right. So that we know that that's not so much a theory anymore. But here's what I think that he's addressing. So Einstein, from what I have read is Einstein was a great mind, but he was coming up at a time where he got most of the credit he got. He became very, he became a famous scientist when there were a lot of scientists working on very similar, right? He was an average side. So getting blown up and contributing to the larger debate about, uh, um, uh,

Speaker 3:          02:40:15       um, what does it need? Uh, quantum physics, right. And so there was also a big debate about their methods, whereas Tesla was a big fan of experiments. Einstein was a big fan of equations and one of the big, quite a big criticisms, one of the big quotes and say, what are you pulling up today? What does this Tesla's overrated debunking Tesla, Tesla's a pop, a figure and conspiracy culture. What is, what is it saying? What is he saying? He says, test. That's not even just a conspiracy. What is he saying? He sat right here. He says, Tessa was a popular figure today, but he's also a self publicist and this stuff he didn't invent. He did not event alternate and current. Yeah, he just was one of many people working on it. Okay. What? He's probably one of the four forefront. Mine's right. Being a showman helped popularize it too.

Speaker 3:          02:41:03       She's so good at that. Eventually had to, I don't know if he's right or not promise and he said there was no one saying anything against it, but there is free energy and he's, he's he 100% official story. He's not against not w he doesn't believe in that one conspiracy. You know, you're right. 100% and that's one of my, the only criticism that had about that guy. Like when we talked about the Gulf of Tonkin, he doesn't want to even admit that Gulf was false flag operation Northwoods. He was trying to downplay, I'm like, look man, whether or not you know what happened in any other place, like you know, the Joint Chiefs of Staff wrote down a memo saying what the plan was to have Guantanamo Bay attack by Cuban friendlies that we're going to give them guns, give them bombs, have them attack American civilians. He's always like, well, it never was implemented.

Speaker 3:          02:41:50       I was like, it's, it's, it doesn't matter. They signed it. Kennedy had a veto. Yes, but Kennedy vetoed it. That's why there's checks and balances and in place like no, no, no. The mindset behind the type of person that would want to blow up Americans and blame it on the Cuban so we could justify the founding families. There would always be people within the government that would do anything they could. And so that's where the checks and balances of course, they don't always go through perfectly. That's, I mean if, if PR, if Nixon was Reagan or, I mean if it was rather if a Kennedy rather was Reagan or Kennedy was Nixon, he might very well have let that slide. Who knows? I mean a different person in a different circumstance with a different view of the world could have let the joint chiefs of staff pull that through.

Speaker 3:          02:42:32       So that shows you the mindset, right? So the mindsets undeniable that people absolutely do conspire. So when you, a guy who never believed in conspiracies, you do just as much damage as a guy who always believed. Alexander Hamilton said that it's not just a king you have to worry about, it's your actual government that's been elected. So just because you, your parliament, he was using promise as an example. Just cause problem was voted in, doesn't mean that small group of people will not get power hungry and trunk. So therefore you've got to have all these checks and balances. You've got to have courts, you've got all kinds of things and you have to have a Senate and a house of Representatives. This is where these ideas came from. That's what the of those fucking

Speaker 1:          02:43:11       guys, well it's the only thing right now is keeping Trump from instituting. He has traveled, man do it a lot of [inaudible] still. But even with those checks and balances, he's still able to cut back the EPA budgets. Democracy. It was from the Paris climate agreement. So there's a lot of weird shit that goes on that they didn't anticipate us, but what they didn't anticipate, they did put enough checks and balances that it's keeping from one person, from just completely dominating the thing. Because they came from monarchies. Those guys, they came from monarchies. They knew that no matter who you are as a human being, whether you're democratically elected or you're, you're divinely elected like the king wasn't in Europe, you are going to take advantage of your power. You're going to get drunk with power. It's very human and to want to have control over other people and do for them what what they don't know is best for themselves.

Speaker 1:          02:43:57       That's oral man. Look at whether it's Libya or look at North Korea or looking at people want to dominate the people around them. They've been doing it since the beginning of time. If you don't think they're doing it right now, you're fucking crazy, right? The question is what is the absolute objective thing that's happening here? Like the objective view of what's happening here. That's where it gets real tricky for all of us. Whenever we say we know that something's happening, there's no way you could know and I know that there's no way you can know, so now we have a really tainted conversation because we're not looking at this whole thing. Honestly, whether it, whether whatever the fuck it is, whether it's aliens or life after death or anything, I need to absolutely fucking know that you're being honest. Yeah, and as soon as I don't think you are or if I think you're trying to gain power, if as soon as you see a politician give some bullshit fucking speech where you know that they're giving this cane, this canned cadence, this nonsense rhetoric, and you knew as soon as they get into, they're going to give into the fucking special interest groups.

Speaker 1:          02:44:54       That's right. That's what Bush, it happens with everybody. It happened with Obama. That's why a free press, that's why a free press from all different angles is so important. Uncensored press and that's why it's called the fourth estate man that keeps puking power in check. Transparency does, and that's the other thing. The other problem is that when government grows, which it always has a tendency to do what does government do? It taxes and passes laws to very coercive measures. You keep growing government. Here's what happens. It doesn't get more powerful nest. It gets more powerful, but also more people are dependent on it. More people are feeding from the public trough and then it becomes really hard to get rid of it. It's really hard to get rid of a government program once it starts because they're a cottage industry grows up around it. To me that's the big problem they have right now with prisons. Yes. There's so many fucking prisons. And then they start prison guard unions start passing laws. They started lobbying to get laws passed to keep marijuana illegal, to make sure that their, their prisons are filled because these prisons become generators of money. That's right. They don't become places where PiCompany economies in slaved. Dude, it's so, so your politicians not going to say anything that's going to get not grow that industry. That's too much pressure. As a politician, you spend 40% of your time raising money from strangers

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       for your next election. What about that conspiracy theory about uh, uh, hip hop and rap, gangster rap being created to promote um, crime. So conspiracy theory, welfare is any loan in there, long beach apartments trying to figure it out or the private prisons. People profiting off prisons. Right. If they have any connection to timeline. Here's the problem with the timeline there with the private prisons weren't really that popular. Doctors, the seventies prisons were popular. Like the rap music really came up. The original racing wasn't even, but it wasn't even a real gangster rap. It was gangsta rap. The way we're talking, like when the Bronx was on fire, I'll close to specifically gangsta rap. That's the conspiracy theory, get to the next level and that the gangster rap from Compton and all that shit, but he came from New York, man. It came from when the Bronx was a game came from.

Speaker 2:          02:47:14       That's where we're asked to wrap though. Came from rap came from New York. That whole story with the security deniable that like ice tea and Nwa and ice cube. That's think about that to help him. They would end up Niggas for lies and more new. But yeah, you guys remember that. The album Niggas for life, that's what it was called. The Mexican says, no, he can't kill hookers. They had little skits in between the songs and they, they're at a song about a gang raping. A 14 girl. You go in a drive in that day had a song about, she swallowed it. It's called, she swallow those 90 to half involved. We fucking, how did they get away with that? Because we hadn't evolved. We didn't know what it meant. Dude. Straight outta Compton had killed the police. You know. That's right. Fuck the pope. Wasn't that when public enemy or is that, that's Nwa.

Speaker 2:          02:48:12       Public enemy had some harsh songs. They got away with a lot of shit. Fuck the police. That's the worst thing you could see at a concert saying, fuck the police storm that you're jumping when you talk about like the gangster rap in La are kind of jumping up. You're not gangster rap started incompetent representing York because there's sip up and then there's gangster rap. It's ended up, you know, as I'm shooting in La, I don't know man. No you don't. But I'm out of my lane. It started in college, not talking about it. Bra 88. Um, I got them about Pavarotti.

Speaker 2:          02:48:56       He had a song called the police. He's not, he died. I've already died. He was greatness. I saw him singing person really live. Yes, I totally shit. And he sang Nessun dorma which you should really listen to it. Nessun Dorma no one sleeps. Listen please. They no one sang at the met because they couldn't hit that fucking dope. They tell us not that his book go ahead, hit. And I got good things to say. That's a, a play paradox. You motherfuckers and the greatest restaurant in the world via Veneto down in fucking Venice. If you don't go there, you're fucking lost show. And this show, I can't, there's some things I get obsessed with and that's it. That's my restaurant and fucking pub rock thing. You fucking sell it out in Australia. He's never been to Australia and started to feel insecure so he gets shut off.

Speaker 2:          02:49:43       Sorry. Eastern. Hey, you're making me feel you're triggering me dude. I'm trying shell trial back in Calabasas. You man, shout out to Max Holloway. Run in Hawaii with an iron fist. Shout out to Max Holloway was bring this bitch home. Hold on guys, let me get this to the people watching. How many people? 48,000 you Zit, couple of people listening. Probably less now. How many have we got? No, probably less dropped us rise talk now they'll, we had government talk, we drop about 10. Sorry, I brought to a halt. Fox News kills another trigger. You motherfucker, you're triggering 17 views. He goes, no, I get why you would read it. But Joe doesn't have that. So why would you tell people have stress? They're listening. I want to help you guys don't even remotely commiserate. You're like, bitch, I ain't got that problem. Save that for Solo. Oh God dammit.

Speaker 1:          02:50:46       We're gonna wrap this up. But I want to say this. Sometimes we have these podcasts and she ain't, shit gets crazy and we get heated and we started smoking pot with drinking. And there's like a, a missing, there's an a wrong impression that some people get that window. We love each other. I have the best time. You no matter what we agree or disagree on, you know, I think it's uh, it's important.

Speaker 2:          02:51:10       This is a family man. I've, I've had a lot of arguments with my brother and my cousins and stuff and it's like, you know, you are mad and you aren't going back and forth and I'm like fuck that you said that and he said this. But when it, when it's all said and done man it's good

Speaker 1:          02:51:27       cause I respect your opinion. I respect your opinion. I know Jamie, I've got quite know all you guys. I respect everyone in this room's opinion and I think it's very important even if you don't agree with someone's opinion to be confronted by it because I think if everybody just look, we've all been around that one person or many people like especially like old time celebrities, celebrities that are famous in like the seventies and the 80s and shit when there was no internet and then they, this never felt this need to check themselves. Sure. You know, they were never informed. And I think that one of the best things about having a group of friends like you guys and like all of our comedian and I think all of our Jujitsu friends too. And I think that's one of the things that kind of ties it all together.

Speaker 1:          02:52:10       You get a different, a different group of humans who, who've experienced a lot of weird shit, who, a different group and you have a different point of view than me on a lot of shit. Whether it's MMA, whether it's, um, I mean there's always, we always, we, you and I have had spirited discussions about shit that we agreed or disagreed on the entire time we've been friends. But you can do that and still be cool to each other. And I think that's what's really important. I think also the great thing about friendships after you get to be my age anyway, and you spend a lot of time with people, is that this is getting very, I want some violin music, but this is serious music coming up. You're coming up now. Here's what I want to say. Hey man, you gotta be frank there. Gets it.

Speaker 1:          02:52:58       They get to a point with friendship. You know where I was thinking about this with you, like you could do pretty much anything. You're never not going to be my friend no matter what. The only thing that would maybe question is if you heard a child, God forbid, or if you were drawing animals in your basement, then I'd be like, ah fucking guy. But you know what I mean, guys, don't help you bury somebody back. Exactly. That's exactly right. Feet touching her breasts. There's only, I mean there's a fucking small handful of people that I would call if I murdered somebody there in this room. Yeah, I would, I would. It'd be a burner. Call me. Don't call you. Call the loyal dog first. Cause I do it. Listen, we're all fucking, he'd get scared and go, I have a tummy ache. I got a tummy ache.

Speaker 1:          02:53:42       But Malibu was only six months old electrical class. My dog's afraid and living to do root cause. The first guy you call your dog right here. Last time we did one of these podcasts, got 10 million downloads, Chris, the last time. It's probably the biggest thing other than the Alex Jones episode number one, number one, and Alex Jones is one of the Alex Jones episodes, one of the best pieces of evidence that there's some potential opening for some sort of a conspiracy to keep some people down because the Alex Jones episode, not only did he get more downloads in any podcast we've ever done ever, but he got more by like what 4 million deep state, the deep state cooking, lots of silence him. It's up to 15 million, but no, here's what they did do and I don't think that they look, it could be catastrophic coincidence, but during the time when the ounce Jones episode wet running through the charts of our art, like downloads, we get like if I have a number, like this is my number one, this is my number two, the Alex Jones is 5 million downloads ahead of everything. Now here's the crazy thing. Itunes ratings went down and I don't think they went down on focus. I don't think they went down on purpose, right? Lead just his ears. They coincidentally,

Speaker 2:          02:55:05       this is what's undeniable. They coincidentally went down the very time that the Alex Jones podcast was rampaging through the tribe state. Now my podcast oftentimes reached number one on the iTunes charts in terms of like the podcast episodes. Oftentimes if it's a real, if it's Lawrence Krauss or Sam Harris or you know, maybe even this, this way. So when that does happen, I've got to say Whoa, fuck podcast. Got 5 million downloads more than any podcast I've ever done. Ever. Yeah, for sure. That one's going to be number one and not only was it not number one, but hold on, hold on. Here we got here. Itunes is being gangster honors about, hold on, hold on, hold on. Shut the fuck up. What Jamie currently number three and four overall. Okay. We are our pot. The episodes to Alex Jones podcast never got past like number 20 or so crazy. Yeah. Not only that, but the ones after it and the ones before they got way less downloads were all ranked higher. All rank tires. Do you think it's because, because I listened to that and you guys got so fucking crazy towards the end dimensional shot molester. You guys got, you all got Hillary completely nuts. I had, I had turned you guys off. I listened to two hours and I was like, well, now we're in killed.

Speaker 2:          02:56:21       Get good until hour three. It was not, not try this now almost three hours. I was like, oh no, my God, I think people turn, they went to, they're too drunk. You guys got too drunk and be honest with you, got too high and dry was fine. People got pissed. People, God, whoever. I had so much heat and publicly Cholos and shit got mad at me. Gangbangers gangbanger got fucking man, Alex Jones Kid. He started thinking, he started going, he'd go like metallic Tara. Tara Trump told me, and then you guys just go off on another fucking tell us about that. But he was high. But that's what Alex, Alex, to tell you one subject, they'll turn corners. George Soros making the marijuana stronger and then next thing you know if the astronauts really did lay on the front, but the problem was they found aliens. They're like, hey, hey, hey, hey. Have you ever seen, he goes back and forth and back and back. Damn, he got you.

Speaker 2:          02:57:16       Hey, sit back. Wait, wait, wait. Stop it this whole time. This whole time. I'm the crazy motherfucker and I go, one of these days, he's been friends with Alec Johnson's fucking 1998 he should've been on Alex Jones. Should have been on episode three or four or five. We ended up being 911 finally, I waited all this time. I knew what I was go this time. I go, oh, should I even asked Janko Dude, let me fucking jump on that bitch. I had a, I never knew that. I never do that. I did that for Paul Stanley and kiss shit didn't work out, but I was in town and I said, I can't make it. I'm going to be out of town. But it turned out you were good though. But anyways, I showed up and, and I'm thinking finally, someone else is going to just talk for me. And for the first hour I didn't say shit right and doing nothing.

Speaker 2:          02:58:11       I didn't say nothing. I didn't say you're an augurous chem trail. Shit. [inaudible] and me and Alex Jones have talked about chem trails and he knows so he knows a thousand times more about chem trails than I do. He has the documents memorized in his head. He's got a photographic memory. So I finally wanted, I finally talked after an hour and let him go. He wowed the whole world. Everyone's like, oh shit. Oh Shit, we're getting fucked here we are getting fucked. And then I decided to bring the chem trails up and he didn't want to talk about, he want to talk about Trump, you want to keep going on Trump. And I wanted to go chem trails and I kinda, I got Kinda pissed, you know, and I was like, fuck, I've been waiting this whole fucking time. Why do you, why are you so obsessed with chem trails?

Speaker 2:          02:58:54       What is it about chemistry? It's just scared air. It's just hair. I don't know.
