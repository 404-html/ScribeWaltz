Speaker 1:          00:00:07       The Joe Rogan experience podcast, whenever, whenever you talked to a rapper or any dude who has like a name like kid cuddy, you'd never know. Am I supposed to call you kid? I'm immortal technique comes on the podcast all the time. To this day, I don't know what to call that dude. I love it. He's cool as fuck. I love talking to them, but I never know what to call them. Don't call them tech comm. A mortal Mr. Technique. So I had to ask you before this podcast started, I said, do I refer to you as kid cuddy or do I call you Scott? I introduced myself to other human beings with my government name Scott. I don't walk up and say goodbye, but no. Like I get Mr cuddy sometime and that's a little weird. It makes me sound like a stripper or something. Mr [inaudible]. Mr Cuddy, Mr Kelly's cool. If it's like a chick. Yeah. Yeah, that's a. it's. It's a weird. There's not a whole lot of white dudes who ever pulled off the like the nickname, like carrot top weird Al Right. Weird. I was always weird. Al. It's always weird. Al yankovIc. No. Hi, I'm al yankovic. It's weird. al right. P dot p dot diddy, puff daddy, prince, whatever. A lot of black guys pulled it off. I mean just. You just keep going forever, but there's a small handful of white people ever pulled off the nickname.

Speaker 2:          00:01:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       I would say you're going to talk about captain kirk, captain and captain into neil. The kid goes deep into the 19 seventies drAwer, the captain to neil. What? How. That's a terrible band from back waY back in the day. Terrible by today's standards, but back in the day, people love them. Do you remember the captain into. You know, I don't remember what they sang. I shouldn't even say that terrible because I'm being a dick because I don't. I doN't remember any of their songs. Probably sitting tHere like, I believe one of them is dead captain. I think one of them got some serious anorexia through. I think the woman got serious. I might be mixing my stories up from 19 seventies bands that I barely pay attention to, but you want to talk about the people that have got some fucking stories. You know, the people that that grew up during the sixties and were like famous during the seventies.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       Yeah. Those are, that's a strange little slice of americAn life right there. You could imagine it was just a whole nother way of living, you know? I think there was a lot more communication amongst human beings. Yeah, for sure. Like just, you know, just casual conversation. It wasn't like weird. Nowadays if you even just say hi to someone walking down the street, it's like, what the fuck? Being polite. LIke what the fuck did you say to me? Well, I think two things are going on. One, people are just nervous because there's a lot of new stories about terrible things have happened over world. Like most of whAt you get in the news is terrible things, so people always woRried about terrible things when they meet strangers and then to everybody's fucking texting and emailing and the amount of time you spend. Person a person has probably been greatly.

Speaker 3:          00:03:13       Yeah, for sure. AnD, and, and um, support, you know, there's healthy dose. They'll probably just put up

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       picture the capital. Now we know. I mean, one of them love buddy miles. He has one of those caps and routes all the time. That's a good cap. Just letting everybody know that you liked to party. Miles teller, miles teller. He wills, he wears a cap like that all the time. That's one of those things. If you walk around with a captain's hat on and you're like a sober guy, you're an asshole. No parties. He gets it in one of those dudes doesn't smoke weed. Doesn't drink. I don't do toll straight. I'd be wearing like a captain's hat. You're a fucking idiot. But there's something if you're like some hunter s thompson do with captain tat on your, on while you got a bottle of whiskey in one hand, a bottle of vodka. The other that's. I want to talk to that dude for real. you know, I'm hanging out with him. Yeah. There's certain outfits that you allowed to wear if you get fucked up like the way stan hope tresses, like if stan hope was like a sober guy that he can pull off that outfit. He's hammered all the time. So he was wearing this bright checkered leisure suit or whatever he wears.

Speaker 3:          00:04:19       Yeah. Every city he goes to a thrift store and tries to find the most shittiest, I guess, suit you can pop.

Speaker 1:          00:04:25       Oh, sweet stuff that doesn't fit them all the time. It's like barely fits him. He's awesome dude. You're a, you're a young man and you're doing very well. Everything is going well for you. This is A trying time in your life. Yeah, man. I'm trying. What's it like to be kid cuddy?

Speaker 3:          00:04:42       Uh, it's um, it's cool man. I feel like it's intrusive. No, no. I mean, um, you know, it's nothing too spectacular. I'm mostly like trying to stay creative and uh, hang around family a lot, get family time and when my mom and my daughter and so, like my life is split between that and you know, creating, you know, it's a good balance. I found the balance now at 30. At 32, you're living the dream. Yeah, it's cool, man. I can't complain. You know, the days I complained, I realize I can't complain. You definitely can't complain. No, I mean to be a professional entertainer is probably the luckiest job of all time. Like you made it. Well, it's really deeper than that. I think that just have a fan base, you know, that supportive is the real ultimate blessing because you know, guys get record deals all the time, you know, some of their music and shit, you know, but then it's just like, you know, but then when you have, you know, you have a lot of artists that come and you know, ended up having like a grassroots following and they have a fan base that rides with them then entire career.

Speaker 3:          00:05:47       That's, that's man, that's a, that's a blessing on top of a blessing. You never know because today's audience, you know, these kids like you one minute, they hate you the next, like you want me to hit your next and to have a fan base in that

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       type of climate and it's awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:06:00       Yeah, that is the thing that it used to be like if you were a rapper or any kind of entertainer, you were only as good if you're a comedian, you're only as good as the people got to see you out there. LIke it was really difficult to, to build a fan base if you weren't on something, if you weren't on a television show of your warrant, you know, a weekly regular guests length the tonight show or something like that. It was really hard for someone like build a fan base. But today because of the internet, rappers, singers, musicians, I mean everybody, comedians, all, they can kind of keep tabs and just communicate with people directly.

Speaker 4:          00:06:34       Yeah. Yeah. And I feel like I caught him was at the beginning, the early stages of that wave of just know another way for people to find music online, new artists, you know, music that you probably wouldn't hear on the radio stuff. That's quality, quality, you know, music and now you know, things are way more advanced. Even since when I started, you know, when I dropped dead at night, that was 2007. I think the only platform at that time that I had at my disposal to upload music was my space and that was literally how the world discovered my voice, you know, through my space music page. And how did my space dropped the ball so hard had the world by the balls. They had everybody. I think, um, you know, everybody I don't think, I don't even think they've fallen off like that. I just think that there's just so much. There's just so much out there. There's definitely, there's an over abundance of, you know, this, like for every facebook there's five more other facebook's. Well there's always new ones coming out too. It's got to be hard to figure out a new thing though. Like what's the new things that involve video? What's going to be the new thing? Memes and emojis. I think it's just a combination of everything just like, well you, it's a one stop shop to just anything that you can dick around on the internet with. It's possible through this

Speaker 1:          00:07:53       app, you know, probably. Right. And I think it's also, have you seen that new thing that a unbox therapy did a video on? Oh my god. Louis from unbox therapy did this video of this new iron man tech. If you go to his page, go to unbox therapy. Iron man for real. I think it's called as a youtube video that he put up. It's insane to do. You're putting on these gloves. Are these goggles rather that cover your cover, your eyes sort of oculus rift style. but you see everything. I would see you clearly. But in front of you there's like icons and things that I can move around. I can open things and close them. And you do it all with hand gestures. So like as I'm looking at you, if I have these glock, these goggles on, I'd be looking at you and I'd see these floating geometric objects like boxes, circles and you can open them up and close them and move them around and they stay places like minority report style. Oh she remembers doing that on a screen. But you're going to be able to do it like in the air, like when tony stark put that helmet on it, that's going to be like reality and in his

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       words and louis' words, he said, this guy wants to make the world the desktop. The world is your screens while it's takeaway screens and the screens are going to be the world. You put this thing on and you just see through it and there's no more screens anymore. Everything you do, you do through this. This is his ultimate goal. Now there's the like the glasses look all like fucking gnarly, like some super visor, virtual reality them, they're right up there. They're pretty big right now. But so was the first phone. Remember those home telephones, those giant boxes? They used to have to crank call people up and needs to fucking put cables into holes and shit. You remember all that. That was what a, that was an old phone used to be like, but you know what, this type of technology you wouldn't want, you know, walking down the street or like on you everyday that easily to access.

Speaker 4:          00:09:48       I mean, people wouldn't, you know what I mean, like it's kind of like not that weird that it's kind of big and something that you gotta like be stationary with at home. That's actually saves, saves a world in some small way for a few years. You met? Yeah. Until like, you know, apple figures it out to have it on your phone or something. But they're gOnna they're gonna make it in like a google glass form for sure. Well the google glasses is like just a smaller version of that. yeah. So you can't, you can't, you swIpe and stuff, but you can't really manipulate the image in real time. Have you played with it at all? Yeah, I got one. One, it's a, you know, it's cool. It was, I mean I'm not gonna. I went out in the streets a couple times and I really noticed. I actually tweeted about this, tweeted about it because it was so funny to me.

Speaker 4:          00:10:31       My experience going on public with google glasses. People just really thought that I was either taking a picture of them are filming them and that when people were really concerned because there's no like, recording lie and you could tell it, there's a lens there, you know, and especially once you miss people ask you what it is and you say google glass, people have heard about it. They're like, are you filming me? And I thought it was interesting, you know, because this is something that like, you know, you might see a celebrity, you know, freak out beCause they're getting photographed or filmed trying to, you Know, live their lives and do something with their families and try to have some privacy and then the public really doesn't understand why they might freak out and why that might be intrusive, but it's, it's a funny twist for me to walk in a place and all of a sudden someone's like, are you filming me?

Speaker 4:          00:11:11       Whoa, whoa. Like, what are you doing this? It's like, no, I'm not filming a random person that's intrusive because I understand that that's intrusive, but it is a potential option for the future. That's what's weird about it, but it just, it was, it was interesting to just see like that was besides people being like, oh, it's cool, can I try it? It was just like, are you filming me? Like, are you filming mary taking a picture at home? I supposed to know that you're telling me the truth, you kNow, because you could just be lying and then even if I take it off it cuts off so it's not like you could see what I'm seeing when I'm doing it. You know, They have little cameras, members stand hope had that fox show way back then they had little cameras that would go on glasses like in the eyes, the eyebrow part of a glass and he put his glasses on and he would walk into some and do these pranks

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       and they would. The film was good enough to put on television and that was a long time ago. Yeah, I mean you could film stuff and put it up on your twitter through the google glass and the photos are pretty quality of that in a couple of times. Oh wow. It's going to get crazier than that right there. It's gonna. Get to some point where you're going to be able to put contact lenses on or something, you know, but I don't know. I mean that's, that's wild shit with the contact lenses and they all have their own. they get charged with solar power because your eyes are always open. Yeah. Constant solar energy. Right? Technology in my eye though, I don't know if I want to. Yeah, I definitely don't want to right now, but if the problem is everybody has it and it's awesome, you know, I mean I would have always been tied to a phone just because it's so dope.

Speaker 1:          00:12:42       Like to have a phone. That's an incredible thing. I'd rather have a cyborg arm before I have a contact, a cyborg arm. You know what I mean? But when you see the real thing about the sidebar ground, that really freaks me out. This is no bullshit. It really does kind of freak me out. I, we watched this video once of a dude from Australia. They got his arm and his leg bid off. I think I've seen that exact shit. It's amazing, so this guy had no army, no leg, but he walked without a limp and his hands moved around and didn't move as good. I mean it probably couldN't play piano or something like that, but move pretty god damn good. A lot better than the old ones that came With the hook style old ones and I was thinking like this guy is still a person, 100 percent human, but he has an artificial arm and an artificial leg.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       Like what if, what if the shark bit everything but his head and they took his head and they put it on an artificial body. What would that be? THat is that still a person. I guess it's a person because you got a person's head, but what if they said, listen man, this transfer of your head to this artificial body is not working that good. Your body's rejecTing it. You're head's rejecting the body, but the good news is we can completely duplicate your brain and put it in this artificial head. So to be like your brain, except better because it's never going to get old. It's not going to rot away like, well, are you a person then? No, because I think your soul is gone. At that point. I would like to believe that too, but imagine if that's how people were essentially created in the first place. Just what if they slow improvements,

Speaker 5:          00:14:12       what if they go, okay, we're going to take a snapshot of your brain right now because we're going to transfer it to this new body, so anything after this point, you know you're not going to remember. So then in for like 10 minutes before they pulled the plug on this body, you can just abuse the person that death or even your body, not the existential angst

Speaker 1:          00:14:32       dying and having no soul. You're thinking about playing with someone ball

Speaker 5:          00:14:37       and you're 40. Congratulations. Speaking of cameras, joe, I just got one added to my car so it records everything. Now that my car does and it does it on gps and then when you watch it on your computer, it shows real time. Google maps and a three 60 view almost of your car, your front. And that's pretty interesting. Yeah, it's called roadhog hawk, hawk road hockey, and what it does is you just put a memory card in there and it constantly records. Where are the cameras? The cameras like this little box, it looks like a baby radar detector that you just put a underneath your, uh, behind your rear view mirror. So you just put on the windshield right there and you have to run power. I just plug mine into my cigarette lighter and it connects to gps and it records on a memory card. Where's the cameras? The camera has a wide angle lens so it gets everything in your car, the front of your car and it also gets sound and it attracts everything because I was just tired of driving around hollywood, like going to the comedy store every night and then, and then like almost getting in car accidents, crazy crack heads, like jumping in the street, like all this shit happening all the time, like something's going to happen soon, you know, and I don't have this polluted. People have to see this when, you know, in Russia,

Speaker 1:          00:15:51       that's when they had those, uh, those mediators, they caught those. That's how they caught him. They caught him because those people have dash cams because apparently I'm like fraud and like that kind of shit like accident of fraud, like super common in Russia. Like they pull shady moves all the time. So a lot of people have those little cameras on the dash to make sure that they could resolve disputes, you know, like there was a thing that was going around in California for a while where people were suing people. They would get an accent on purpose. A bunch of people die from it. They'd get on the highway, get in front of you and slam on the brakes. So he slammed into him and this one dude who was an illegal alien, so it was like all the republicans were up in arms when he's the only one illegal. Alien does something shady. Everybody freaks the fuck out. But this student done it a couple of times. He'd done it a couple of times and that was his move. That's way it made a lot of money just getting in front of people, slam on the crazy. Yeah, but that's a risky fucking shit where you ain't got nothing to lose. It's like fuck it. Yeah, I guess it's just they're playing the lottery and the promise land just very, very strange. That's the item that

Speaker 5:          00:16:55       item c right there is where you put the memory card in

Speaker 1:          00:16:58       and it's not that big. No, it is kinda like a. It's hard to tell perspective wise,

Speaker 5:          00:17:02       it's like a cell phone size basically and he just like, I can't even barely even see my mindset high hidden behind my mirror,

Speaker 1:          00:17:10       like a disposable camera. It was probably the best way to describe it. It's like a disposable camera.

Speaker 5:          00:17:15       What's cool? It does like a dvr loop, like would they like a security companies do or where they have to film everything, like a jewelry store or something. It just, when it gets to the end of the memory card, it just goes back to the beginning. Unless you pull it out and save the files. Records over records, everything over and over and over, long before people start making porn with those. I know, but you know what it's also great. Automatically turns on, so if you give your car to the valet or something, you could hear what they're doing to turn it around. That's what I'm getting at. That's all right. SenD me link valet

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       porn. Valets. Blowing each other in your car won't get onto your car. You're like, what the hell?

Speaker 5:          00:17:56       But I'm reviewing it right now. I have a review. What site now do you ever review? Website? Java lamps.com. Oh, that's good. Yeah, it's good. Do you. You stopped doing that for awhile? Yeah, I lost my amazon account. Wow. How does that work, man? Did you ever try to get it back? Yeah. I tried three times with my llc, a social security number or whatever the business id number tried with them, so it was completely away from me. I tried everything and finally they just let me through because of this java lamps thing. TheY did let you through. They just finally did after about four years of not letting me do it. Just because you changed the name of your website? I guess so website and everything. I don't know how annoying. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:43       It seems like there was a weird thing. It was like they're upset at you because you're connected to porn. Right?

Speaker 5:          00:18:49       Porn stars on desk squad meticulous. Yeah. There's nothing wrong with porn stars. Nothing. Nothing. You just don't. They sell porn. I mean if you go to amazon.com, don't they sell porn? Yeah. VIbrators. They sell hitachi's. By the way, did you see ms dot martinez, our friend missy. I killed tony with us a lot of times she was on tmz because her hitachi blew up in her pussy.

Speaker 2:          00:19:13       No,

Speaker 1:          00:19:19       really blow up in airports. You blow it up in her pussy and make it the equivalent to the mexican dudes slammed on his brakes on the highway. It was. Was it the vibrator equivalent? What happened? Is it to the breaking crash.

Speaker 5:          00:19:35       What happened is it starts sparking in flames and smoke starts coming.

Speaker 1:          00:19:39       Footage. Did she start screaming? Yeah. The pussies that good. That's why it's sparking. No.

Speaker 5:          00:19:46       There's the hitachi though, and what's weird is that this is not new. There's nothing new about this. If you look online, there's tons of hitachi's blowing up and a porn stars. Yeah, because it's the only vibrator that you plug into a wall, so it's like it's like the dumbest because it's really for your back because it's supposed to be high powered, but like girls are getting so numbed down there that they're using these hitachi's, these high powered ones that just shave off my.

Speaker 1:          00:20:16       Oh my god. They take things to the next level. Just like when we were talking about bodybuilders have like the 19 sixties in comparison to the bodybuilders it today. I think it's the same way with like the way girls beat on their pussies. Absolutely embedded in the old days. Just a little spit and defenders need anything that didn't need anything. Their vaginas. We're super sensitive technology. Fuck things up. Soda doesn't fuck things up for us apparently if you don't. If you don't have a for skin, the head of your dick, it's like kinda just abused. So it's bouncing around inside your underwear and like having a force, getting the reason why men are upset that they're not just the fact that it's ritual, genital mutilation, that doesn't make any sense, but also that it kills the sensitivity in your dick. Yeah. but yeah, I mean that's great.

Speaker 1:          00:21:03       That's great. You like you're addicted. Look like clint eastwood and not like fucking ryan seacrest or somethIng. That doesn't make any sense because you're beating the tip of your dick up. I mean if you look at your data, it looks like you're beating up your dick and it looks like clinics with today talking about clint eastwood from the fucking outlaw josey wales. You're talking spaghettI westerns. I'm talking about porch one. The handsome clinics would not the crazy looking old man. Obama. He talked to obama. That was. Do you remember? Do you remember that shit that he did on tv where you saddled bama down? No, you didn't see. Watch It. We'll pull this out dude. Yeah, we'll pull it up. This was recent. oh my god. It was general presidential elections pretended to sit obama down onstage and improv. It didn't have anything pointing to say, but improv'd it. It was so incredibly disrespectful. It was so. He was just pretending to have a conversation with sat him down below him. He didn't just have a conversation. He wasn't like pertaining to have a conversation with obama where they're looking eye to eye like men. No, he sat him down in a chair and started. It was the strangest fucking thing ever. This is it here. yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:22:18       He was having that thing and they were talking about hope and change and they were talking about yes we can. And, and it was dark and outdoors and it was nice and people are lighting candles and they were saying, I just thought this is great. I mean everybody's crying. Oprah was crying. I was even crying. And then finally I haven't cried that hard since I found out that there's 23 million unemployed people in this country. Well, he sat them down here. Yeah. To cry for discretion. National. I'm home tomorrow morning.

Speaker 1:          00:23:07       No, you got to back it up because that's the chair pushing down in the chair.

Speaker 6:          00:23:11       You were running for election. No, no, no, back it uP a little bit more now. It may be time for somebody else to come along and solve the problem.

Speaker 6:          00:23:33       So mr. President, how do you, how do you handle a, how do you handle promises that you've made when you were running for election and how do you handle, how do you handle that? I mean, what do you say to people do. You could just, uh, you know, I know people, uh, people were wondering, you don't, but I know even some of the people in your own party who were very disappointed we did, didn't close gitmo and I thought, well I think get cash at closing gitmo. Why close that? We spent so much money on it. Uh, but, uh, I thought maybe it's an excuse a, what do you mean shut up? I thought it was just because somebody has

Speaker 7:          00:24:23       you. Otherwise the whole thing worse. Worse. I remembered, I remembered it being bad, but holy shit, I like how cnn like jumped to like the mtv camera where were there in the audience and saw shaky, like to try to make it more like entertaining him talking to him. So ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:24:41       What the hell is he doing? He's being an old dude. That's what he's doing. Being an old republican dude. Get all crusty, conservative. Not like then they don't like the youth. The young of America. Like yourself to that movie. Didn't he just do that movie though? Uh, what was it a.

Speaker 7:          00:25:01       Well, he's like the movie and you were just talking about about the immigrant pissed about people being on this porch. Yeah, I, no, it was named after, but no, el camino is el camino because he knows the grant. You know the black keys, the black keys have a cdl

Speaker 1:          00:25:22       called el camino? Don't think so. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. El torito,

Speaker 7:          00:25:29       whatever it was outscored torino grand screener. No, I had a friend whose girlfriend had one of those cars

Speaker 1:          00:25:38       way back in the day. That was a goofy ass car that was back in America. Just made these houses on wheels. They made a living room. They just drove around and this big old fucking crazy american cars, man. Yeah. That was a movie about what it was like about immigrants, wasn't it? I don't know if it was people moving in his neighborhood.

Speaker 7:          00:26:02       I just remember seeing that in the preview, seeing really pissed about kids being on his porch yet. But I mean I was sold. I mean I wanted to see it. I just never got around to it. Maybe I'll check it out. I think you've got better shit to do with being pissed about people being on phone. He had a shotgun in his hand to. Do you remember when clinics. We did a reality show. A lot of people don't know that clinics, which wife was on a reality show before we got divorced. He divorced her, but she was on a reality show and it was like some knucklehead chose ridiculous, but he was. He on episodes. Don't remember if he was on. I never watched it,

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       but yeah, it's one of those things where like the wife wanted to do it and he was like, oh, okay. He finds himself with some ridiculous situation. Have you ever met him? No. I always see him in burbank because I think he has a studio at warner brothers, so he's always walking on the sidewalk out there and it's weird just driving by glenn did. That guy gets a path from for life for me, for the unforgiven that I think it's the greatest cowboy movie of all time. Oh yeah. That shit was like, it was so realistic, so dope. That was such a good, scary ass cowboy movie. That was clint eastwood. Its finest, you know, I just love how he's just like, I don't live like that no more. No movies. Just like I'm not that guy. I love it. And then they just dragged him in.

Speaker 1:          00:27:29       Spoiler alert. Oh yeah. That's not tell him, but he's like one of those dudes that becomes this old guy and then he becomes like super duper conservative. You know? There's a bunch of those guys like cosby's a guy like that. He's like super duper conservative now, jon voight. Yeah. You know, I mean that movie though is one of, is one of my favorites, especially morgan freeman to one of my favorite morgan freeman movie. Fuck yeah. Yeah man, that was just a perfect movie. Yeah, just the way the women. I don't want to give away the ending, but the way it all goes down so much more likely than most of those stupid shoot 'em up movies that was much more probably like what, how the way people would behave. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. It was. And it ended up getting messy in there, but I like how I kind of just started off like real chill and you kinda just, you know, okay, yeah, I'm here.

Speaker 1:          00:28:24       Yeah. That was a fascinating look at the old west. I was like, it's almost like he did it, like he did all those westerns back in the day, like the good, the bad, and the ugly and fun movies. But they weren't super realistic, you know, and I think as he got older, I mean I'm just speculating, but he wanted to do one more. That really got it right, like the way they make movies today as opposed to way they made movies back in like high plains drifter days. Did you see true grit? Yeah, I saw both. I saw the old one, the new one. It was not bad. I knew what it was. Not bad. It was not a bad mood. I liked it. It's just whenever you have a movie where you're redoing an old movie, people are harsh, you know? I mean, but, you know, I feel like it kind of brought some of that realness that, you know, unforgiven hand.

Speaker 1:          00:29:08       Yeah, it definitely did. Yeah, there was doubt. I mean, it was a good movie for sure. There was a lot of fun shit going on that movie. But goddamn man, remaking a john wayne movies hard. Uh, uh. Yeah. I mean, you know, hollywood, they do what they can. I mean, it wasn't like, you know, most of the shit that comes out that gives me gurgitate. It just kind of be hard to make movies, man. You know, one of the beautiful things about, do you write all your own lyrics? Yes. Thank god. I'm blessed with that ability, you know, a lot of guys don't see. Think of that. Just think of, think of that like how happy you are that you write on your shit and imagine this, you're a one man situation. You know, if you want the kid cuddy experience, you only go through one door. There's no one else there so they'd go to you, but you don't have to worry about the producer getting along with director, get along with the actor. The network has notes of studIo rather has notes about the script, the screenwriter or wants to change this and the actor wants to improv that. You're managing it out with the fucking makeup lady who's fucking the hairdresser.

Speaker 4:          00:30:12       Everybody's doing blow after the sets closed down. It's craziness, man. Making the movies go down that in music though too, you know, my career is just purely my vision and stuff. so it's a different, it's a little unorthodox. And you know what most people do, you know the average, you know, pop star, It might be about, you know, six people involved just to get the album together. You know, somebody gets songwriter. If somebody to get the producers in the room, you know, um, and then there could be chemistry's off, you know, this person might not mess with this writer and this producer might not mess with this artist and there's all this going on and I'm pretty sure it gets messy, but that's this. I've just been blessed not to deal with that. You know, I have a, I had an idea of, you know, what I wanted my career to be and I've been sticking to that goal, that, that plan.

Speaker 4:          00:31:02       What was the idea if you could give us like a one line of it? Man, I really just truthfully wanted to tell my story and hopefully it inspired others to not feel alone, you know, and understand that they can persevere through anything, you know. And at that time of writing, I like to tell people I don't even know if I believed half of this shit. I wrote, you know, like when I, when I may pursue the happiness, I was hopeful for happiness, but I was in such a dark place at that song. For me it was more of a nightmare. More than, you know, supposed to be a happy, uplifting song. You in a dark place. How so? Well, just like I think coming to terms with just the fame factor, you know, I always, I always felt like I would get some type of recognition, you know, I didn't know to what magnitude and you know, people say like, oh, you know, you know, what you signed up for, but like really don't, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:31:53       And you kind of have an idea and you feel like, oh that'd be cool. But like I didn't and I still to this day I don't look in the mirror and see myself how other people see me, you know. So I never, I never could prepare myself for, for what came and everything came so fast, you know, I had so that, that brought on darkness. Yeah. Because I just, I wasn't comfortable and then I had to, you know, I was in a place where all this pressure, all of a sudden a to be something and to deliver a certain type of quality and these are things that I've stepped up to the plate and I was excited about doing, but I didn't know that it would stress me out to that magnitude that it did, you know? Uh, I just didn't know that many people will be watching and paying attention or care that much, you

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       know, what was the number one consequence? I just think the end that I didn't see it being too too big of a consequence that I couldn't deal with losing a lot of my freedom. But then I have a daughter, you know, I just worry so more about her now and I just want her to have a normal life and I want her to, you know, have that opportunity and not, not I think about it more now than I did then, you know, right before she was born. Yeah. I'm sure. Yeah. I have children. Once you, when you have children, it really becomes more about them than it doesn't even about you and a lot of ways the way you live your life is now always going to be like, what's the best way for them, and if it's not that way, you're goIng to feel sick, right?

Speaker 1:          00:33:26       You're going to feel like you're doing something wrong. Exactly. It's a weird situation. When you bring people into this world, you're responsible for little tiny people and you gotta you gotta teach them shit and raise them and. Oh yeah, no one. It's really hard. I mean, no, I wouldn't say no one because I think people are capable of intellectualizing it, but most people have no idea. I just put it that way. How intense the love a person has for their kid is. Yeah. It's pretty intense. Yeah. I mean it's, it's something that, you know, you have to have. You have to have a child to experience, you know, you can't explain it. You know, it's, it's just. I mean, my is man, she everything. It's also by like when you see kids that are abused, it's so extra disturbing. yeah. Because it's almost unimaginable who would do that?

Speaker 1:          00:34:14       Who would do that to anyone's kid and who would do that to their own kid? It's just, you know, I've met people that have their parents beat them and it's a fucking weird place to be, to talk to someone who is the person they love more than anything. beats the shit out of them when they do something wrong, you know? And there's a difference between a weapon and beating. Well, this adrian, this nfl thing, the guy who beat his kid with a stick, you know, the excuses that I guess like when he was young, that's how they treated him. That's how he was raised. Like, I don't know what the kid did. That was so horrible. How old was this kid? You know, I man, I don't even be reading into that really young, right? Like nine or something like that. Well, whatever it was, when you know, when they talk about, they say, well this is the way he grew up, which is true.

Speaker 1:          00:35:00       But man, there's gotta be a way to end that cycle. You can't be beaten in kids with sticks in 2014 and everybody should know that by now. I just think it's a cop out for people to use that as an excuse. We like those hall was raised even like just with anything, you know, because that's just a cop out. That's just somebody not wanting to change and grow with the times. I mean, if we could find any way to be less violent, we should try it. Yeah, certainly. Anything with these victims involved, especially if the victim is a little kid. Yeah, and by the way, if you get kids used to the idea that the person they love the most, their parents is a person who's going to beat them and hit them with things. You are introducing violence into that kid's life at a very early age and that violence becomes a natural part of the world, becomes something they expect. That's why they say that people who are around their parents beating each other up are more likely to be involved in the abusive relationships. When they get older, they say that kids, people who are hit by their parents or people watched their parents hate each other and were hit by their parents even worse apparently. It's awful. Yeah. I mean, who's to say? I mean, my mom spanked us, you know, but she had three boys to deal with by herself. Majority of the time, you know, it's not like, you know, I, I don't, I don't,

Speaker 4:          00:36:16       you know, look at my mom is a villain and you know, but she didn't beat us. I can't say like I've been beaten by my mom did some, some hoe ass shit, you know, my mom reprimanded me and I deserve it. You know what, you're doing some sucker shit as a kid, you know, especially before you do it, you know, and you know that there's a, a consequence that comes with that. But I've never experienced that. You know what I'm pretty sure a lot of people are talking about right now, but just like thinking it's okay to beat up on your kids, but like my daughter's four and a half, I haven't had to reprimand her in that way and I never will. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          00:36:53       Yeah, I do. I think it's a different situation too when you've got a single mom dealing with young sons like shit can get really unruly. That's what I'm saying. It's like holy. But even. But even with that it, they weren't beatings so it's like a difference. That is a big difference and that's, that's something that people don't like to admit. Right. It's never good to beat your kids, but if you're a young woman who's raising young boys and they don't respect you. Shit, I got a yard yardstick and my mom had a yard stick, which you hit on my ass, but it never hurt. She would smack and I'm like, oh, okay. I deserve that rating. Not like stripped down naked. Now after you're out the shower, catch you off guard, you know, take the yard sake. It's aluminum, get on fire until it's fucking hot.

Speaker 1:          00:37:48       I saw video of these fucking idiots. One kid put an iron, a hot iron, a little lost a bet kid lost a bet. So You put a hot iron on his back like after mark left the iron mark life too. IT's not going to most likely fucking some brand college kids, man, kids and kids today that are trying to make videos of all this shit too. It's like half the thing that they're making videos while they're doing this stupid shit. It's the motivation. It's like let's show people how fucking idiotic we could be. Verbal scholar, we're lucky. More people aren't. That seems like people are telling themselves accidentally left and right trying to make these fucking videos. You see that video and I'm not sure if it's 100 percent real or not, but the girl boils water and in films hurt take this huge thing of boiling water and pouring it over a dude's head

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       and he's like, there's pictures of him just. He's been in the hospital with all these burns all over his body from yet

Speaker 7:          00:38:42       just from the als ice bucket of boiling wAter. Yeah, totally serious. I'll find it for you. Oh my god. People are so stupid

Speaker 1:          00:38:54       that it's probably real. I don't know if it's real, but I bet it's probably real. People are dumb as shit, man. Fuck man. That saddens me. Fuck, that's not cool. Yeah. You can overhear some conversations that will make you lose your faith in humanity if you imagine if you were there in their goofy ass back yard, but thinking about throwing boiling water on this kid, you'd be like, you know, dad is gonna. Fuck You up for the rest of your life. You're going to be covered in scars, but that might as well be lava. You idiot. That's again, like your life has changed forever after that. Yeah, I mean it's a very least is going to be some pretty significant scarring, right? Boiled in water, the medical bills for that, you know, just the pain suffering just for one stupid ass video where people can think you're an idiot

Speaker 5:          00:39:39       tissue on your face for the rest of your life because of. Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:39:41       so were these kids uh, like where they reprimanded and.

Speaker 5:          00:39:46       yeah, it didn't really get into that part. It just showed the video of the girl doing it, boiling the water and I'm doing it on them and then make a news. No, I think it made the news because there was a, there was a photo of him later where he's just sitting there all burnt, like bandaged up. His whole body's off

Speaker 1:          00:40:00       fucked up. Fuck man. What is this desire to make these fucking goofy videos?

Speaker 5:          00:40:06       It's horrible in bullying now. Has taken it to the next level because kids are all filming them. Bullying people and then putting it online. So now it doesn't mean bowling. Bowling, bullying, bullying, bullying,

Speaker 7:          00:40:19       price, bullying. I'm like, they're going bowling. They're going to go away. I thought that was like a new thing where you like to roll in a fetal position. Pins. I was really trying to figure out what you were saying,

Speaker 5:          00:40:31       but yeah, but people are taking videos of them beating up other kids and then putting it online and sharing it around the class and stuff. So now you just see these videos of these poor kids.

Speaker 7:          00:40:41       Well, how are these kids not getting in trouble? I mean can't they are now, but

Speaker 1:          00:40:45       the acts are already being done. Yeah, we live in a weird times. Weird times took where we were talking about earlier about people worrying about your google glasses, recording them because they're recording everything and kids are growing up with that. It's like a part of a normal part of life, you know? When you, when you first got into the internet, would you say you were in your late high school days when you really started getting into it? Because that was, I mean you're 30 now. No computer except at the schoolhouse. So that was the only time and then you couldn't really explore that much. You know, it wasn't much out there because. Well there was stuff out there but I mean the teachers kept it restricted. You know, there were some sites you can go to and you know, you couldn't, you couldn't watch porn and stuff back then.

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       It's a big bummer. Do that. They can block stuff now in schools. Right? Do they block stuff? They have to man. I mean the internet is just so much more on there now than there was back then. But do they allow like porn sites, like in dorms, can kids get download porn? Well, I mean there's, I mean jamie, suddenly you have to go to a site no more. Well, Yeah, I mean you don't, but you could always just download it right from like a torrent. Well you can just google porn and it'll be right there. Right? That's true. Yeah. But I just wonder like bundles, tips, guys. What's your favorite camera? Do I Look in the one behind? You know, it's right. There. It is, right? You're a natural pitchman for the internet. The internet's official spokesperson man. They need to hit me up. Let's go.

Speaker 1:          00:42:26       So, you know, getting out of high school and then growing up like essentially like young teens, twenties, all that like being able to like get online at school and then being completely immersed, like being a part of like interactive communities, talking to people. That's one of the first generations of musicians that's able to do that. It's able to go directly from high school into communicating online with people releasing stuff online and then, you know, becoming a part of this first generation means a bunch now there's like a lot of artists that are becoming really well known because of just interacting with people online. Not even, not even any music, just being online and you know, whatever happened in an identity on, on, on the internet, you know? Yeah. There's that too. Right? That's something that people value about you as well. It's not just that, you know, they like music, they like you, they like to talk to you. You know what I'm saying? Like you've got a cool personality. Like you're a cool guy, you're a cool guy on social media, you know you're yourself. Yeah. No, I think that's important though.

Speaker 4:          00:43:35       I think it is my job and my calling to also show the world a different type of person in the position that I'm in, you know, someone, you know, it doesn't, it isn't really big into conforming because of my job because you know, the people around me because of the people I work with, you know, I always tell people I'm a human being first before anything, you know, you're born naked, you go in a really nice suit, you know, and, and everything that happens in between, it's just madness. And we figured it out along the way. But you know, it's really interesting how a lot of people just kind of like, you know, get this, this blessing, this job, getting this business and they just get really caught up and I never want to. I never wanted to be that guy. And the beauty of twitter, it's like first I was really against it because it's just so much, you know, unfiltered anus.

Speaker 4:          00:44:27       And I've learned to appreciate it. Like literally I get a of competence just by looking at my feet and seeing maybe a couple of tweets that are like, yo man, keep doing it and I'm not necessarily doing anything right now. I doN't have any music coming out but it's just a random tuesday and there's some kid in Minnesota that's like, yo, I fucking love you dude. Keep going. we're listening and I might have needed to hear that that day, you know? so like those kids don't know that that means that much to me in the. And it does. So like I wasn't really that big. We're talking, you know, and having such a presence online because I was weird about it or not. I got a grip over it. It's no problem for me. I love that I can, you know, just hit up a kid randomly and just make their whole year, you know, just some competence in something that's using it for good, you know, rather than me posting a picture of some jewelry or some new thousand dollar sneakers I bought it doesn't do anybody any good other than being like, damn, I ain't got shit.

Speaker 4:          00:45:22       You know, and that's the reality that people realized and then it's like, well, I need to do what I gotta do so I can have what he had and I don't want people to think like that, you know, like when I post I like the posts, like, you know, maybe my lactaid milk or does this come from like lessons that you've learned watching other people and, but like the, their behavior and you felt like the shortcomings of their behavior once they became famous. Oh yeah man, I'm watching everybody around me, you know, and I think and I, and I and I kind of use, I want kids to look at me and understand what not to do. You know, when I was dealing with my drug issues back in 2010, 2009, you know, I was heavy into cocaine and it was like a big thing for me to go and it was like a really big thing for me and it was something that kept me level.

Speaker 4:          00:46:12       It's something that I felt like I needed self-medicating. And uh, you know, you felt like cocaine. Keppra level. Yeah man, because I had this whole technique, I don't know if I even should get into this. I don't even want to talk about this and you don't have to go run around and talk to do it. You know what? Let's just say I got into like, you know what I would call like a trifecta, which was, you know, I will wake up in the morning, I would know, do coke immediately, even before I had cereal, breakfast and then I would have a beer and then I would smoke weed. So like I never wanted people to know I was doing cocaine, so the beer and the marijuana leveled me out in a way where I was able to walk in the streets and talk and, and seem as though I was not anything but deep inside I'm just like z with my face and just like, yeah, that's right.

Speaker 4:          00:47:00       You know, but what it did for me, it completely numb to me. I didn't care about anything and I was a robot, but also with it being so numb, it allowed me to go out and meet my fans and beyond the street. So when a twisted way it did, it did a positive thing for me and that's why I didn't see it as an issue and I was like damn, today I went walking in soho with no place to go and I was just high fiving fans and shit. Like it was just the most amazing experience, something that I never get a chance to feel because I'm just like such a recluse and I'm just at that time was just weirded out when people recognize me and just didn't want to go anywhere, you know? Yeah. That's an issue with suBstances that can help you in some ways, but they're ultimately detrimental to your health or wellbeing or your ability to keep it together.

Speaker 4:          00:47:50       Yeah, I mean I abused it, you know, it's not like the guy who like goes out with his buddies and spring break and it says like, yeah, let's do a pump. And it said, hey, cooL. You know, those guys aren't real people in movies. Everybody else is just too broke to go. They just don't have the amount of money that it requires to be a fucking fulltime head. It was definitely expensive, man. It was definitely expensive. But you know, I um, you find like why you're doing it every day. Like was there a thing that made you stop? Because that's usually there's, you got caught and then people started to know I did it. Yeah. And it was like, damn, now everybody knows I do it. It's not cool anymore. Like it's only cool when no one knows is a weird one, right? Yeah. It's like I didn't really let you know, I didn't let the public made me feel bad about it though.

Speaker 4:          00:48:38       It was just kinda like, fuck yes, I can't do that no more. But then also my daughter was born so it was like, you know, it was, it was like to kind of life lessons back to back that I experienced in 2010 and you know, my daughter's birth and being arrested were those two things because I think I had already started toning down on my cocaine use the beginning of that year. But then I was the king of like something tragic happened at or something I felt was tragical stressful and then spiraling back into it. Just needing any excuse to be all right, I'm going to go do cocaine now because I'm set and I'm dealing with something and I don't know how to deal. Just like my way of copping out and avoiding my issues. Wow. You know. So it was like a block. It was like maybe a couple months ago by I'd be in Hawaii, you know, working on some stuff with kanye and I never did cocaine or anything around those guys.

Speaker 4:          00:49:24       I was like my time to detox when I will be away because you're not if you do coke, coke with other people or alone. And I felt weird about traveling the world and every place I was at asking people where the drugs was at. So like it was something that I did, you know, at home, at a certain time, you know, and which was, you know, I was able to kind of keep it together and go out and work on my music and be into it. I had a system, it was a weird six system I developed for myself, you know, we're, you know, I was able to be cool if I wasn't in New York, but then when I was back in New York it was on, you know, because it was just like being at home in the apartment alone for hours on end. Just really just got me, you know, and doing it just kinda like, oh man, I could just put on leaky lee and just chill out for hours by myself.

Speaker 4:          00:50:11       And it's all good. It's interesting that the arrest made you want to stop because you really was it because like the feeling like, oh shit, have an event has taken place. Like this is obviously a big sign that I'm going down the wrong direction. I'm in, I'm dealing with the legal system now we're getting arrested and I was. It was just more like, did. This is not scott [inaudible]. How in the hell did I let this become scott mess? HoW in the fuck do I got people looking at me like I'm not scott mescaline and I know what it was and I know how to fix that. And I went and I just, It was just, I didn't like how people were looking at me at that moment in time. So they're looking at you like you're a coke fiend. Yeah. Crazy cracked out dude. Like everywhere I would go it was just these looks and I was just like, man, I just did a little blow

Speaker 2:          00:51:06       y'all motherfuckers acting like y'all ain't never did a bump get outta here

Speaker 4:          00:51:11       man. Like it was. So I was like, are you kidding me? People love to be sanctimonious. Yeah. Yeah. But, but that's the thing. When it happened, I wasn't like, you know, on, you know, the next complex interview I did, like I have a statement that I use this camera. I'm really sOrry to all my fans for you guys knowing how I do cocaine now, where I used to, I don't do it anymore. Uh, I'm sorry if I let anyone down. Fuck that. Fuck that. It was really just like I'm dealing with some shit if you don't understand it. I don't give a fuck. This is how I was surviving. If I didn't do it, I would have blew my brains out. Well, I like how you describe it to because you're very honest about the positive aspects of the effects and I think that's super important. And this was my contract by the way. This release. Sorry. Don't worry about it. everything's a proper method. You're very muffled.

Speaker 4:          00:52:04       You're very honest about the positive benefits of it. Like people have this idea like you shouldn't talk about positive benefits of any drugs, whether it's harmless drugs like marijuana or dangerous drugs like cocaine. He maybe even especially dangerous drugs like cocaine because the reality of what you're saying, your experience and the positive aspects of your experience, it's like he's promoting drugs when clearly you're doing just the opposite. You're talking about how you needed them and use them and they helped you, but the reality is it was because you were dealing with an issue and it just helps mask the issue, but it did help him to lie and deny that it clouds the issue for people dealing with their own drug issues, dealing with their current drug issues or their past drug issues. People aren't honest about it, man. It puts people in this weird place where you don't mind.

Speaker 4:          00:52:54       If I wasn't for fucking meth, I would have never started this business. The reason why I'm doing so well is because I got on like, I mean, there's some people that can say that. Probably the only reason why I could sit here and say that is because like, I've been four years clean man. I'm not like running and I can speak about it candidly and it's not something I'm weird about. And uh, I've just grown so much since then. And I also know that the more I talk about it, you know, the more it'll help somebody else who be dealing with it. You know what I mean? Definitely. You know, when you're in that, it's probably just, it seems like you can't get out of it because it is like a thing, you know what I mean, and cycle and you get caught up in it.

Speaker 4:          00:53:37       And um, you know, I just know is with kids listening to me talk now, it's, it could be helping a lot of people. I'm not like one of those people now that used to do cocaine and I'm like, oh, you're bad if you do cocaine or cocaine. Spanish didn't do cocaine mean I don't promote any drug but I'm not judging anybody if they do it, but know it's not like a big deal. Like I did it and I just abused it in a way and it didn't benefit me. It didn't benefit scott. I didn't like the person I was becoming. There's some people that could do this shit and they can live and do it in moderation and it doesn't affect their lives. Like how it affected mine. More power to them. They got super powers if you asked me, but I just have that, you know, it's a history of drugs in my family.

Speaker 4:          00:54:21       It was like my blood was waiting, I was like, yeah, like, let's go and I know that about myself and I just had to make that choice. I had to make a choice and I think that's with anything, cigarettes and you know, four months, five months done with now, um, you know, you just have to make a choice. And I made that choice for myself, for my own health, my daughter for a future, for my fans, you know? Yeah. A bunch of people quit cigarettes. [inaudible] the anthony bourdain quit cigarettes because his daughter to just realize like, what am I doing? Yeah. I mean, for me, Like my, my, my father passed away from cancer. All my uncles passed away from cancer and my father died when I was 11, you know. So that was an experience for me, uh, that kinda like traumatized me in such a way.

Speaker 4:          00:55:06       But I can't, you know, when I got older I started to, you know, do everything that my father was into. Like my dad smoked newports. I started smoking newports 17, you know, my dad's, you know, he, he loved mgd. Miller genuine draft. I fucking drank mgd millage and draft, you know, it was a tribute to him. No, I just kinda was becoming my dad in a weird way. And, and you know, it wasn't, you know, it was like one of those things you don't. I don't know, I just kinda, I never really had a relationship with him, so the only memories I have was just this guy, like, you know, like this guy was just so cool. He had a cigarette and he had his beard and he was always awesome and he was there for me as a man and up until you left, you know, uh, and I think I kind of got caught up in that and that's something that like, you know, I can't say the image of my father drinking and smoking is what made me drink and smoke, but I can't say it didn't.

Speaker 4:          00:55:58       Right. Do you think you took like comfort in it? Maybe like, I think maybe, yeah, for sure. I think everybody takes comfort and smoking cigarettes. It's like one of those things. Yeah. That's the grand trick that cigarettes pull on you. Did they give you comfort in that need to replenish? Like you give you a little stimulant from the nicotine and all the chemicals that are in the cigarette and then you're so addicted to it that you have this weird when you don't have it and then when you smoke it relieves that stress and you think that it's actually calming you down. But all it's doing is feeding the dragon. It's like a drug. it's anything. Oh, it's a drug. Nicotine is one of the craziest drugs all time because there's legalist book and you could just get it anywhere. Like they presented in such a way where it's all cool but you know, and, and that's another thing too.

Speaker 4:          00:56:45       I don't come to my aunties. Smokers either like friends come of my house, they smoke, I don't shush them outside. And you know like you can smoke in the house. It's not that really. You don't mind people stinking up your house. There's on cigarettes bother me. I smoked for a long time and you know, it's not like I got people chain smoking in the house. Somebody needs a cigarette, one or two school. I have friends that used to smoke and if they smell it, they get sick and I'm cool with. I'm cool with it. I just, it's more just like for people that can't stand, that there's people that might still have an issue with the addiction, but if I smell it or anything like that, it's kind of just saying, oh, it's not for me. It doesn't really bother me. You don't have a poll that doesn't pull you towards it.

Speaker 4:          00:57:28       You don't want to smoke it again. I mean I get, I can't say like occasionally, and this is something that just will forever happened because I was addicted to the shit, but like I can't say like after a meal, a really good meal, I'm like, oh man, a cigarette would be nice, but I don't do that no more. So that's that. And then I said, wow, good for you. You know what I mean? But I got hypnotized. So hypnotists. Yeah. Yeah. And do you remember them advertising you? Yeah. Yeah, I remember because you have to, you have to receive the information, you know, that he's telling you, you have to really process what he's saying because it's really a reeducation of the dangers of, you know, it's kinda like what we learned in health class when we were in school as kids, you know, it's no different except, you know, over time the fear is not, you know, as heightened as it was when we were fourth graders sitting in the room. But our teachers saying like, oh it does, your lungs are nice and pink like this. Oh, and if you smoke they're black like this.

Speaker 4:          00:58:27       It's not over time we see pop culture, we see the james deans, we see everything going on and then it doesn't seem as dangerous. And, and basically this guy reminds you of the dangerous and kind of reboot you. And it's like psycho shit. It is kind of. And as an adult you take it a little bit. It's really funny just how the cycle of life goes. It's like, at my age, I guess I was able to look at it in the same way I saw it as a fourth grader, you know, and just kind of realized, oh, this is, this is hurting me. Talked me through it. They lie down on the couch and close your eyes. They turn the lights down. Well, I had him come to my crib, you know, because I'm wanting to feel comfortable and I had a knife there. So if you tried any funny moments, but I'm just going to let you know, touching me, I didn't know what was happening. I had, I had to shake my pillow in case there's a comedian that, a comedy store, no bullshit. There was a comedian and used to go to the comedy that used to hypnotize

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       women is. His thing was that he was a comedian, but he also did some hypnotist work and like he would always hypnotized girls. And like I remember very clearly one time I was walking to the back of the comedy store and he was talking to a girl and she just pulled her head away and she goes, no, I don't want you to hypnotize me.

Speaker 4:          00:59:42       And I was like, wow, it's true. That is out there hypnotizing people. That's fucked up man. So cool. When they do do it in your bed? No, we were in the living room on the couch and you kinda just sits there and he

Speaker 1:          00:59:56       don't sleep on your back. Okay. So you fully stretched out pillow behind her head. Just relaxing. And then when they count you down, what does it feel like?

Speaker 4:          01:00:05       It feel like you're tired as hell. Like slipping into like, you know, a dream system really relaxed. You just really relaxed. It's like. Had you been touch before this? No. First time. First time. Only time. Only wants us at three times. Three times three and three separate sessions. Does their weeks apart, does it feel different each time you do it? Or does it feel the same? No, after the first time it's like he does his thing. It's like after the first one it's like you don't, um, uh, you can smoke between. So it's like we did ours from tuesday to tuesday, so they came that tuesday, that whole week I was allowed to smoke right after the first session, after the first therapy session and the hipaa hypnosis. Then after that second week you're done completely. Then after that third week it's like kinda like reestablishing that.

Speaker 4:          01:00:59       It's done and that's the final one. But after that first one, it's like the final week. Right. So to come out of that hypnosis instill, you know, him telling me like I can still smoke. I still had this urge to like, I don't know if I want to do that, you know, like I was allowed to smoke. He said it was cool. I remember like my first cigarette after like the hypnosis, I waited like a couple of hours, like I had the, I had the, that urge but I wasn't so quick to jump into it. Why did he say he could smoke? What's the logic behind it? You ask him? Just kinda like took to, I don't know, to give it a minute to give you that last week too, just know that this going to be up after because he tells you like, all right, so just this last week you could smoke and then after that second session you're done.

Speaker 1:          01:01:48       So when you're going under and he's, he's telling you I'm going to count you down and then boom, you're under. Do you remember the first things he said to you? Like do you, were you conscious of it?

Speaker 4:          01:01:58       Yeah, yeah. He's just basically, you know, just talking about, you know, the dangers of cancer and what it could do to you and how it's just nasty and it's Poison and just everything you could imagine that we'll kind of put it in a way for a human being. Understand and get it like, okay, this is dangerous because that's what it is. I think the average person that smokes a doesn't see the danger in it like that because you might see, you know, the, the old lady that's 80, 90 years old that's been smoking on her days, it looks like she's fine, you know. And he'd just be like, well, I'll probably be that lady or I'll probably be that guy or you know, but the reality is you don't know, you know, and it's like a gamble every time. and it's like literally I'm him just kinda, he'll give me scenarios too.

Speaker 4:          01:02:46       And I don't even know how much I could reallY talk about because he, he sells this, this is like a thing, you know, you just really gives you examples, you know, just like scenarios, like simple example, like if you knew someone was uh, you know, if you were dating a girl and you knew that, you know, she was known for poisoning her boyfriend's putting poison, uh, rat poison in her food, but there wasn't real approved. But every guy she did it kind of got murdered. But hey, you know, we're dAting her for awhile. And she said no, she wanted to finally cook for, you know, you know, like, what would you do, you know what I mean? Like would you, if you knew for a fact that she was a killer, would you let her cook your food? Would you let this person into your house?

Speaker 4:          01:03:31       No, you would say I'm not fucking with the chicken. I mean guys stopped messing with a chick if she calls too many times, like you know, like it's just kind of the reality of like, man. Well anytime you've seen any obsessive behavior, anything dangerous people, but it's kind of just that reality, like it's poison. It's going out your way to buy poisoned to put in your system. So you felt much more in touch with the reality of what it is. Yeah. Yeah. And so, you know, I just, I've seen there's been curious about like what the state is like of being hypnotized. You don't feel, you don't feel disconnected? No, I felt like I was, I could have woke up at any minute. I felt like if somebody or if you try something, I could have smacked the shit. Ain'T really worried about him trying to y'all because just like you just like, you know what I'm saying, if you've never done it hypnosis and you see in the movies, it just seemed like you kinda like vulnerable and, and, and, you know, I just, I didn't know what extent that would feel like, you know, I didn't want to be like, I know what you're saying.

Speaker 4:          01:04:27       You know what I mean? So did he ever. Have you ever seen like one of those comedy hypnotist shows? No. You should go and check bark like a dog or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. It's just one guy that does it particularly. Right? It's, he's known for it. Well, there's a bunch of people all over the country to do it. Oh, okay. This is like a thing. Yeah. Yeah. It's a thing, man. I've seen her. When I was starting out in boston, there was this comedy club called stitches and uh, they had a guy named Frank Santos. She did it there all the time and I thought it was bullshit at first and then from being there all the time, I got to see all these shows. I realized like, whoa, no, you can just hypnotize some people. Oh yeah. And you get some dudes to come in their own pants.

Speaker 4:          01:05:06       They would think they were having sex, they would take care of sex on stage and they will be on the ground like humping. And he would tell them when they were gonna come and they would come and they'd be embarrassed and then they'd go and sit down. Yeah, I'd be embarrassed. It's like somebody with a ghost hand coming. They're jerking you off when you're not noticing it. It was so cool. Some people apparently are super susceptible to it, but he knew he knew when people were under and when they weren't under. That's why I was. I'm always confused. Like you. So you, you were coNscious but you were under. Yeah, like he'll do things like um, once you say yes, you know, so he'll, he'll know to check and make sure that you're under or whatever. There's certaIn things that he'll, he'll do like and I'm paying for it.

Speaker 4:          01:05:50       So it's not like, you know, I'm my lying right now. It is under though. That's what's confusing to me. What is that state, I guess between dreaming and awake? I mean I'm definitely like the understate is more just like a relaxed feeling. Not like sleep, right? But it can be. It can be, you know, you could feel I could sleep because you're breathing slower and that's what sleep is like, you know, you're relaxed. And to us that's what sleep feels like. Not that relaxed state, but your conscious conscious. I hear him crystal clear. I'm not in deep sleep, you know, it feels like it, but I'm, I'm not. I'm hearing everything clearly. I'm understanding him. You know, a saw. I'm not snoring here. It's not like it's not weird you feel president, but then you just are really, really chill. So it's just basically like some weird middle state.

Speaker 4:          01:06:47       yeah. It's the in between of some shit that happens that motherfuckers know how to do. like I've never experienced anything like it. What's the difference between one session one and session two, session three m, I can't be the difference between session one and session two. I can say I can't really differentiate between session two and tHree. Are you allowed to smoke out? You're allowed to smoke after one or you'll have a smoke after two, after two, you're done after two. You don't want to really. I think that's when he actually like, I think too, the difference between the first stage and second stage, the first stage, she doesn't really instill anything. Like when you wake up from this you're not going to be smoking cigarettes anymore. Like he doesn't say anything like that. He's just educate you. And then it's like, no, you're going to come back, you know, and I'm gonna call you out from from 10 all the way up to one, you know, and count you up and cut you up.

Speaker 4:          01:07:38       But he doesn't say, he says like, you can smoke this week, you know, and, but after this you're going to be done. You know? so like you come out of that first state just kinda like, okay. But like I said, I was hesitant to smoke. I really wanted to smoke. But would it be something that, that was something that stuck still in that first session that made me like, oh man, is it is kind of gross, you know, success rate. Did he say iT literally? I mean, he says everybody does it, but I know, you know, I'm pretty sure a lot of people have a hard time with it, you know, it's not, it's just you really in, this is what he says and anybody that I know that it's done it too. It's really just kind of like, you have to be ready, you know, in a weird way.

Speaker 4:          01:08:23       You just got to be ready. And I think that's with anything in life. I mean they tried to make it like this thing, like you've just got to be ready, but like anything, marriage, you know, even just dating someone or whether it's a job, you just got to make that choice and just really want it for yourself to really commit, you know, in and out. Really it costs money to like you spend, you're paying this money. I mean, it's like a waste of time, you know, otherwise, you know, and he's the type of person where even though he's getting paid, he's, he cares to do this passionate. He devoted his whole life to this. This guy, um, carrie gainer. Uhm, I'm gonna give you his contact so you can, he has a twitter page and stuff and he does this whole thing where it was going to get bombed with dick pics right now.

Speaker 5:          01:09:09       Coming in hot, coming in hot bro. Just, let's just say his name. It worked on my sister. give his twitter page out. They'll get, they'll get them hypnosis. Like my, my sister got hypnotized and it worked for, for about a year. And then she said one day she just woke up and it was gone and she just started smoking. Carrie gainer?

Speaker 4:          01:09:28       Yeah. Wow. That's um, what, what is this twitter. You want to give it out? Oh yeah, sure if you want. Yeah. So find it, cause he's, he's a dope dude man. He's the nicest guy. He totally. As soon as I saw him, I, I knew I wasn't going to have to shank them, but you never know. You never know joe rogan. I mean not everybody has the data that you have dude, where people just like not going to try it. They'll still try a session. One involve chlorophyll. Tough for the squeeze. The sweeter the juice is twitter is carrie gainer a k e r r y g a y n o r carries one of those weird words that dudes are still allowed to have, you know, but it's a weird one. He has a twitter for, for his, his name, for his business name and a dude, k e r r y.

Speaker 4:          01:10:19       I mean, it is, you can get away with it, but it's strange. I think it's an irish thing though too. Is it? Okay. It could be that or it could be a dominant wife. Wishes she had a girl. Well, I promised a promise you that it is not what's going on. He had a girlfriend in high school and uh, her, her mom had a boys name because the dad wanted a boy. So he named her a boy's name. It was the craziest situation. I've known people that have had that. Yeah, for sure. Those ugly though, because, you know, she didn't get along with her parents, like her mom did not get along with her parents. And uh, she always resented that her dad gave her a boy's name. That's creepy. But you can just change it. Yeah. But it was, it was like a love Missing thing.

Speaker 4:          01:11:05       What was the name wasn't I want to say, come on. I don't want to say let's make it mike, but that's not as fast because girls, I didn't want to go named michael. Now it's, it's my girlfriend, my girlfriend from high school, his mom. So I don't think, you know, understood. Understood. But uh, she's a nice lady. But you could tell she wasn't really into people. Especially men. Yeah. So it's the same name. Men with the same name. She had this strange boyfriend for awhile. It's very weird wHen you see like how other people grow up and you see like, oh, that's where that comes from. like you get some weird thing about men and then you go, okay, let me see what's going on in your house. Oh, let me see what's going on. A mom has a boy's name and this is her boyfriend and he's a mess.

Speaker 4:          01:11:53       Okay. Yeah, I see how it'd be weird about dudes. It's science. It's not your fault. It's like do it science in your own house. That's fucked up, man. You know, that's the one thing when it, when everybody judges people and everybody does love to judge people. The reality is not everybody starts off in the same spot. You know, some people get a shit spot in life, you know? and then some people I think a bad spot or an an, an imperfect spot a lot of times motivates them. Oh yeah, for sure. like that happened with you. Oh, most definitely. Yeah. And I think about it like I, and that's what a lot of my, my, my issue came through you, you know, early on in my career I had this moment where literally I had like security and a car service everywhere I went and I just started to feel like richie fucking rich.

Speaker 4:          01:12:45       IT was just, I was like, I got to chaperone. It's like my mom has this person with me every where I go to make sure I don't get in trouble and then like she feeds my bank account as long as I'm good. Like it just felt really weird, you know? And uh, anyone coke he started to get on because it was because, you know, I came from a natural thing, you know what I'm saying? It was kinda like, it was hard for me to like the way of life was just a different transition, you know? Yeah. I would imagine that's got to be a, that's a big leap to come from nothing and then become a famous entertainers. Wealthy is a very treacherous and difficult path to, to manage, I would imagine. I think most people's motivation is to, you know, and I can't say I didn't fall victim to it was just kind of prove people wrong in a way.

Speaker 4:          01:13:32       Oh yeah. And that was a, I mean, it wasn't anger that fueled me though. It was just more like, okay, I'll show you. Well, it's your own desire to determine self-worth. Right, right. So it didn't, it wasn't misguided. It was always just like, okay, I'm doubted the odds are against me, but I know what I'm feeling and this is what I want. Pink. Sign your hand and then you turn it into a tattoo. Pink floyd. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I, I like to feel like a early on in my career I was, I was pink a bit, you know, putting up these walls and, you know, and I kind of connected with that story, uh, early on and, and you know, I was, you know, really into to floyd so much that it inspired my sound. A pink floyd and electric light orchestra.

Speaker 4:          01:14:18       Really ultimately elo wow. Determine the sound scapes for my entire career with vinyl you to like listen to it on old vial. I, um, I don't collect vinyls. I know buddies that do, I have, I haven't gotten into that, you know, I feel like that is a hobby that I eventually want to get into. I'm not experienced, you know, a lot of music that I, you know, would love to on vinyl because I just haven't gotten into that. It's supposed to have a different sound quality to it. Right. Why release all my music on vinyl and, and you know, all my album covers are designed for vinyl covers. Like, and that's a lot of things that a lot of people don't know that. but you know, I designed on my album covers for vinyl and, and for that presentation to be able to see the artwork and you know, have this, you know, and be able to hear it in this certain quality.

Speaker 4:          01:15:07       You know, you can't play kid cuddy back in 1960. At least. You can kind of get a little taste of you. So w we um, we mix for vinyl, we do everything for vinyl. ultimately, you know, we were not doing this shit for, for, you know, itunes and mp3s, you know. Um, yeah, the ritual is just getting the vinyl and then on their end. Yeah, it's a thing, what, that thing is rare today. Like people don't sit down and listen to music together. Like I'll like if a friend is in a car, I'll play him some shit. like listening to this, check this out or if we're here in the studio, maybe I'll hook, I got this bluetooth speaker thing it, hook it up to that. But most of the time you doN't sit down with dudes and just listen to music. But I remember when I was a kid, my stepfather, his friends, they would, they would put on an album and they would sit down and listen to an album.

Speaker 4:          01:15:59       Oh yeah. You know, they would experience. You would get the new one or whatever the hell it was. THey, I remember they had the new billy joel album. I was a little kid, man. That was the, it was a, the piano man. I remember when it was new, they pulled that shit out. I was probably like seven or something like that. And uh, they put it on the record player and everyone just sat around and listened to this billy joel album. That's what people did back when there was two tv channels. And I have, I kind of imagined that's what my fans do and that's kinda like how I create and a lot of people might not. It's like, that's why when I released a single, for example, it might be some weird shit that people are just like, what is this? But in the context of the story, when you consume the entire album, that makes sense.

Speaker 4:          01:16:42       You know, because I don't really make records for singles, you know, I make. I'm making an entire album here. This is a project. What percentage of your music is listened to by products? Something like 80. I think more than that. I think 100 percent talking about the moon again, right? The fuck in, right on, in there, man. That's funny man. But yeah, I think that, that, that's what's missing it. Mainstream music. I think everything is always moment to moment. Single, the single who's got who or what record is not about like sitting down and having an experience, you know, and I'm going to always create with that in mind and I think as long as I do that, I always have an audience because there's people like us that want that experience, that want that feeling, uh, to get the homies together. AnD even if we've all heard the album a trillion times, just to put it on from the beginning and let it play, you know, it's just dope, man.

Speaker 4:          01:17:42       Nope, nobody really does that anymore. Everybody's kind of like spotify this here at pandora and just skipping around and skipping around, skipping around, and that's because music is designed that way, you know? Um, but you, you step into like, you know what we do, the kids know. It's like, okay, you by kid cudi album, you probably have your friends come over. It's a thing. It's like don't open it until I get there. It's a very big deal and I love that there's that type of ritual going on because like, I do it too. I go and I buy my own album when it comes out and kids see me in best buy arguing, like why is it in the front, but no, I'm not doing this shit now. I don't talk to anyone and it's not in the front moving. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. Legal.

Speaker 4:          01:18:28       No, I think there's digital terrorism but, but it's kind of like I look at it like this, if I'm not going out on a day, I'm buying my album. You can't expect other people to do it. You know? If I got to support my own self too, and know that's hilarious. You're supporting your own self. That doesn't even work that way. Just keep the money in your pocket and steal your own album. I really do believe where he really truly support yourself. Get caught shoplifting or album that so everyone would go. That's a big story on tmz. That's like you would be a front page guy. I'd be a be a, but you know, like I really do believe that man. It's just like if You're selling some merge you, you gotta promote your merchant kids. Got to see you wearing your own stuff. It's you got to let them know like, hey, I'm done with this shit too.

Speaker 4:          01:19:18       He's covered in his own murder, never wears anything but death squad, tee shirts and death squad have to make my own closet business and make his own crocs. Croc is going to walk around and he's going to become that guy. I want to pair those Blue crocs with white socks. Kenny's on them. Would you ever wear crocs outside? It's so weird that you said that job went to the magic castle last night. I knew I had to buy new shoes because I don't wear dress shoes. I just remember up there. Huh? No, I got invited. A lucky bastard. You really want to go to that just to see what's up. Just I, I just drive by it every damn day. I want to know what's going on. That'd be easy. Yeah, I can get you gonna going. Okay. But I had to get dress shoes and I was joking with my girlfriend that I was just going to buy black croc so I could use them other times than just dressing

Speaker 7:          01:20:08       up and she thought I warm the whole time because I had an old pair of crocs and like these are what I buy. And she's like, oh, you know, he knows. And then right before I left I switched on, but we had this whole thing last night. No, crocs are great. Do you own crux jump? No, no, no, no, but I mean I don't have any problem with wearing them. I would wear them if there were that comfortable, but I heard they're good. It's my walk outside and get the mail or do something else.

Speaker 1:          01:20:37       Either skate shoes or wear converse. All stars. That's where I were. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. See, I got these leather. Chuck's on. Nice. they're comfortable. I got these beeps Today. Oh, those are nice. What are those? They donate a couple of years, maybe five years old. This came up. I liked it. I liked the star on the side. It's pretty dope. Skate shoes are probably the most comfortable like them and like chuck taylors, those are all pretty much.

Speaker 7:          01:21:06       I used to only wear vans and and then my girl got me into wearing jordans and stuff like that. They're built. That's. I get it. Now. They are the most comfortable shoe in the rural. Welcome. Welcome to the final. You've got Jordan

Speaker 1:          01:21:21       on mtv cribs. Were you going to your house? You've got all these jordan's like stacked up around your place.

Speaker 7:          01:21:26       Look at this right here. Oh no. You son of a bitch. Those are giant laser from back to the future.

Speaker 1:          01:21:39       Is that what their phone? Is it a. Those are the mags and nike max. Are those comfortable? yeah, they are man. It designed the shit out of those. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:21:47       Joe, have you ever wear a pair of jordans or any of those kinds of shoes?

Speaker 1:          01:21:51       I haven't in a long time. When I used to have a deal with nike, I used to have one of those things where like when I was on newsradio that'll give you free shoes and on fear factor too. They just send me boxes of free nike's. Wow. But I just stopped. I don't really do tv anymore. It'd be rude if I kept calling them the yellow so you know, I still need that shit. What are you going to do with this? It's going to work out your shit. but they had a thing where you could call them and they would give you free stuff. Yeah. But I, so they would give me a bunch of stuff that I wouldn't wear like white and red, like basketball shoes and be like I can wear these, but a lot of like cross trainers and shit, they have comfortable shit but I got into smaller sole things that have like less. You'll feel the ground more like chuck's like chuck taylors. I liked that better. I can't perform in jordan's my discovery recently. Really? In what way? I just can't move. I can't imagine that if you live on stage combat boots, I fuck with army boots with a cigar hanging out of your mouth, like fucking sergeant fury.

Speaker 1:          01:22:59       It was ridiculous. How about timberland's? Um, I've seen people do it in all sorts of sorts of footwear, but for me, I'm moving around a lot and it's hard for me to move as quick and as nimble. Why is That? With jordans I'm going to feel that were athletic shoes while I'm not like, well first off I'm not like I don't have them laced up. Oh, you know, like I'm about to go play full court, you know what I mean? So there's that, there's the. So they're slIpping around just the whole like, you know, trying to be fresh thing about it. So they're not like really being worn how it's supposed to be worn. But then like, there's nothing like converse where it feels like you're literally dancing barefoot, like on your tippy toes from one end to the stage to the other. And that's literally, I find like the best sneaker for me on stage.

Speaker 1:          01:23:44       Yeah. Converse with the best for working out too. Like if you lifting with stuff, you just feel the ground with them. There's very little padding but it makes you think like just dudes like julius erving and like back in the day where he used to wear those and actually play basketball games and um, that's incredible. That's what they wore. Chuck taylors, they would play a basketball game with no protection basically, you know, ankles were getting broken. Oh, they probably snapped. But then again they probably developed tougher ankles, you know, like they grew up doing that. Does that make any sense? Yeah. Jamie shakes his head. He's a fucking physio, vascular ankles, man. I'm there. Yeah. Well it doesn't make sense. Like if You used it, it would get stronger. No, like, like if you put too much bracing around it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I would imagine there's a letter right there.

Speaker 1:          01:24:35       You these two. Joe's. Hello kitty. Long and I'm on am my own camera. Okay, I'll make sure he's on camera. We don't want the world now. He smokes weed. So, uh, we, we got in touch because you reached out to me on twitter out of nowhere. Oh yeah, that was cool. We was on twitter talking. Shit, I love what you do joe. I'm a big fan. I'm sorry you don't mind us now please. Okay. Hello everybody. Hello. This is what everybody wants to see, right? This is what you guys want to see. They want to see you shoot heroin bumps and the other one. Brian is a bunch. There's a bunch in that one. Um, Yeah. Do some bumps. Dog.

Speaker 1:          01:25:18       I'll Tell you what, joe, when I get married, I'm going to invite you to my. When me and you going to do some bumps? No, I've never done. I've never done coke. Well, here's the thing. I don't think I'm ever going to get married. So beautiful. This works out for. I remember saying that to get you to be gotten joe. I want to be gotten bro. It's definitely better than not wanting to be gotten, been, gotten is better than wanting to be at. Man. I'm joking. By the way. I just dicking around. Everybody wants love. It's the truth. Oh for sure, dude. It's one of the weirdest things when you know somebody who just can't ever fucking get it right. They can't find somebody to care about. like everybody knows this one girl or one dude that just can't get a girlfriend or a boyfriend. There's always like the struggle. They're always saying gold. They can't

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       find anybody worth a fuck. That's sad. Shit. They can't find anyone to fuck. Fuck, fuck. I mean almost everybody has lower your standards enough to find somebody that'll fuck. Yeah. That's, you know, I mean, I, I mean, I'm not saying that I meet, I don't meet people that aren't worth a fuck, but it is hard to find somebody, you know, and, and it's just, it doesn't, it's no different whether you're a celebrity or not, you know, it's just hard to meet people and you don't. it's also, it's hard to. It's hard to really, I guess trust and believe, you know someone. I mean, how well do you ever really know someone you know and, and you know, how long does it take to say that you really know someone? How do you know what somebody is giving you is really then, you know, it's true.

Speaker 4:          01:26:53       I mean, there's definitely people that were bullshit you and there's definitely people that have layers to their personality that you didn't imagine. You just can't, especially if you cross them, if you develop some sort of a feud with them and you find out that they're willing to just go completely psycho on you and take shit to the next level and start banging on your fucking door in the middle of the night Screaming, get that hoe out of there. Know that's me. I, that's what you do. That's your moving on. Totally. Girl can be that guy mentally insane in the course of a relationship. Um, but no, I feel you man. It's, it's. But I, I, I like to keep a stance where it's like, fuck that, you know, I don't, I don't need anyone but deep down, like everybody wants somebody that's like a companion.

Speaker 4:          01:27:38       You know, there's somebody that's a best friend and a teammate and I, I kind of, you know, will always want that, but it's not something that I'm like searching for, like I used to, like it was for awhile. I was like, I felt like that was the only way I can get a certain happiness in my life, you know, just come to terms with it and you realize that that's not the way. And you know, I'm just very hopeful, you know, that I'll run into somebody but it is tough, you know, and I, and I made a lot of cool chicks, you know, I meet a lot of cool tricks and you know, it's just for me, it's just really, it's tough about being at the right place and right time when, you know, sometimes you're not in the right place in your own head to be a good person to be in a relationship with.

Speaker 4:          01:28:21       Yeah. And that's, and I really do. I feel like, you know, at this time in my life, you know, there's a lot of soul searching that scott needs to do. Scott is talking about himself in the third person. THird person. Yeah. Scott, because I didn't want to admit that, you know, so when I have to admit shit like that, you know, flaws and all, I have to step out. Scott needs to get his shit together. I never. He was like, I have to get my shit together. It sounds so much worse. Uh, jefferson starship man, they said it back in the sixties. Don't you want somebody to love? Don't you need somebody to love? Wouldn't you love somebody to love? Yeah, you better find somebody to love. And I'm pitching Saying, I really

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       feel like, you know what I actually want to add before I go into this, how did you meet your lady? Like was it just like everybody says when you don't, when you least expect it. Like was it at. I like to get you in my personal life on podcast because I think people fixate on other people's personal lives too much and it gets weird when people start talking to you in public about your personal life and you don't even know them. Okay. So I just found there's no benefit in doing that, but I just met her in a normal environment. I met her in a bar. You can meet people. It doesn't. It's like, where do you go? Well, if you go there, like people say, oh, you never meet somebody in a bar or you never meet somebody at a bowling alley. Did you go to a bowling alley?

Speaker 1:          01:29:40       Yes. Okay. Well then you could meet somebody at a bowling alley. People very. It's just finding them and that's what's. It's not that easy. Finding the right combination of you and them and you might be terrible to other people. Like other people might think like the last thing I want is just crazy. Scott motherfucker in my life right now that it's of course, sorry girls compatible with each other and everybody wants to take that as a sign of rejection or a sign as a sign of, you know, your own lack of self worth or something like that. But it's not that somewhere out there there's someone who enjoys your personality. If you, if you're honest and you're nice, like if you're honest with yourself, you understand your flaws, whatever you're trying to do in this life, try to do it well. If you've got, you know, you got a lot of positive energy about you, you could probably find somebody.

Speaker 1:          01:30:31       You got to be worth finding. Yeah, I got to get out the house. JoE got to get out the house. That's step one. Step two, I play a lot of xbox, so that's my thing. And whenever you want to come over, but you could either go deep or you could get out of the house. You could just go oculus rift and lived your whole life. That's like common man. Yeah. It's a neat character. A date in this other realm. this kind of like her, like, you know, it's just my baby in this world. She's hot as fuck. And then when you're done banger, you pull her mask off and it's, you know, is that. Well, the thing is you can always power down. It's not something you got to deal with all the time, you know, maybe maybe they get you like a hypnotist just climb inside your head.

Speaker 1:          01:31:16       I want the world to know that I'm part time a comedian when I, when I want to. so there's some, a lot of sarcasm. So just bear with us here. Kinda like, you know, decipher most of it. Yeah. You don't want them to take it. Any of your quotes in because they come from. I come from a world where anything that come out of my mouth is taken. So literally. So it's like I want to make sure that we understand we're dicking around here and exactly. You know. And that's why I came here today because I don't do interviews and I don't sit down and talk to them because this shit's weird. You know, people aren't cool now advIses coolest joe rogan bro. You know, so like a big fan. Like I said, and I know you're talking about psychedelics and I saw something you were talking about one time when you were talking about how you went into a one.

Speaker 1:          01:32:03       Is it one of those chambers isolation tank? Yeah, and I was in a video I think. No, I didn't. It wasn't video on brian made a video about it when I gave away my tank. It was like one of your best videos. You own one bra? Yeah. Well yeah, I own one now, but I had another one. My old one. I gave it away online. So we had this thing get them. Well you could buy them, buy them online. Shit. Yeah. I mean there's an order. There's a bunch of different companies but. Well we'll talk afterwards because will ask you where you live and then I'll get to tell your best option, but the place that you want to visit. There's a place called the flOat lab and it's in venice and the guy who runs it is my friend crash. He's actually been on the podcast before and he's the master when it comes to float tank technology.

Speaker 1:          01:32:45       He's the guy that really changed the entire industry because they used to be like kind of home models that were like kind of flimsy and you know, they would have all sorts of issues. He fixed all the issues, changed all the filtration system, made a much more durable, much bigger, better insulation, like he's turned them into these incredible, like complete next level devices. That's, that's in California, so the best places in California. If there's another place that's in austin that is probably right up there and that place. Fuck, I forget the name of it. I got it on my instagram feed. All this man. I need all this information. Do you live in California? Okay, well if you live in California then there's one place to go. That's the float lab. Here's. If you look at the video and here's joe's isolation tank he had at his house. This is his old one,

Speaker 8:          01:33:31       the amazon indians, and he brought it back to them.

Speaker 1:          01:33:35       I'm talking about the movie altered states, which is where I found out about isolation tank.

Speaker 8:          01:33:44       It was like 11 or 12 years ago, returns back into the box after double filter. On top of that, I also have this right here, which is a an oxygen scrubber just like they have at those oxygen bars. Well, this, this little machine right here, pulls oxygen, pure oxygen out of the air, and it pumps it through this to where this gets it all gets pumped into the tank while I'm lying in it. So I get pure oxygen, oxygen, which is amazing for your mind anyway. It makes you feel very refreshed. And then on top of that, I'm in this weightless body list experience where you and your thoughts usually my experience it takes 20 minutes is always be thinking about my life, me thinking about my friendships, my relationships, what the fuck

Speaker 1:          01:34:32       you underwater. So you just saId so much salt in the water that when you lie in it, you just float, right? So you're like half your body's above the water like this much and everything behind it is underwater. So like your ears are underwater so you can either wear earplugs if you want. I don't usually wear earplugs, I just get in. But some people like earplugs, you can just rent your ears, you float and you're in total silence. What's the total darkness? Total darkness. So it varies. If you feel like you're flying through space. Like I recently got graham hancock into it, he just did a couple of them. THen that's his description of what he said. It feels like you're in space, you're flying because you're weightless and as you're lying there like floating. That's a. That never happens in life. We don't feel like there's anything holding you down.

Speaker 1:          01:35:18       You feel like you're flying through space and because the fact that you're in this tank with no light coming in and no sound, you have no like your brain doesn't have any work to do. It, doesn't have to worry about your balance, doesn't have to worry about moving you around or dealing with your environment in any way. Nothing's coming in. So this tank was created bY this guy who is a. He's a pioneer in inter species communications with dolphins is. It's really crazy guy called john lilly and he did all these like really important studies with dolphins, like trying to teach dolphins, human words, trying to communicate. All the noises are so much different than ours, but he did a lot of it. While he's on acid. He was trying to develop a bunch of ways to get outside of the influence of the body, like he was being very scientific about it and his ideas where he, he, we used to have like a scuba tank.

Speaker 1:          01:36:08       There was like, you had a helmet on like one of those 25,000 leagues under the sea type helmet he had. I'm thinking like at first we were talking about. I was like, yeah, fuck, that's what he used to have and he used to have it where it was like hooked up where it was on a harness and you would be sorta just dunked in the water. So we'll eventually you forget about the helmet, you forget about your body, you just chill out and relax and the water was the same temperature as your skin so it becomes indistinguishable after awhile. Once he's got it dialed in just right. You don't want it too hot because then you can sweat. We don't want it to pool your cold in there and start shivering is a, goldie locks 93 and a half degrees. It's like 93 and a half.

Speaker 1:          01:36:44       Some people's 94. So a, you should do it, man. It's, it's, it's amazing. So you got to your crib. Yeah, I have one. Could I come over and try? Sure, absolutely. Loved to. Yeah, absolutely. But if you wanted to get one for your house to crash definitely sells those. So I fEel like something that should be in every university, it's something that should be and just a lot of people should, if they have the money or they have the time or a group of people get together and invest in it, it's so beneficial and it's a, it's something that's just, it's not thought of as being an important tool in your life, but the ability to tune the whole world out and just float. That's awesome. Oh, you trip your balls in and out of it because if somebody has to know, it's real easy.

Speaker 1:          01:37:27       It's real easy. It's only 11 inches of water. So as you're lying there, you mean you just stand up when you're done and you just get out. IT's nothing. I mean you, you can't, you can't drown the waters. 11 inches and it's only six feet wide. Just you touched the sides with your hands. yeah. You center yourself in the middle and relax and when you do it, you get more and more comfortable. Every time you do it, the first time you do it, it'll be a little weird. Like everybody's described. It pretty much says what I always have said like the first couple times, it's just about getting to relax, figuring out how to relax. Once you've done it like a few dozen times, then it just becomes that thing you do just get in there and you just say that for me is giant. Whenever there's any issues that I'm dealing with and he, uh, any problems that I have maybe creatively even, you know, I like to go in there, I'll go in there with jujitsu problems.

Speaker 1:          01:38:15       I'll go in there with a try, like try to analyze someone's movements. Like if there's a guy who like, keeps catching me with a particular submission, I would, I would go in the tank and I would try to work out like the defense for the submission in the tank. Yeah. It would go with like a specific goal in mind because it makes your brain like supercharged because we don't like when I'm sitting here, I got a super uncomfortable chair. This is this thing called a saddle chair, a sally's swinging something chair. It's super uncomfortable, but it's really good for your back. it makes you sit. It makes you sit like an arrow, you know? Um, but it's, it's stupid. Uncomfortable men. What was my point? No, he was saying that like, I completely lost my point. We picked up the soap to show the fucking chair.

Speaker 1:          01:39:00       But was I saying just before that, none of you guys know I was listening to three people in this room. That's a sure sign that saying it was very ineffective because no one remembers that at all. I was falling short term. Memory's a motherfucker man. that. Well, where are you talking about? I don't know. Oh, we're talking about a sensory deprivation because this, this gives me a lot of sensory input. It's uncomfortable. It's like pinching my dick. You gotta squeeze your legs together to sit up and when you're sitting in it, you're, you're constantly kind of working out your legs, like you're pinching your legs together. It's the only way you can sit up as if that's the key to it. The key to it is it's uncomfortable and when you do sit like that, it activates your and it's actually good for your back and it makes my back feel great.

Speaker 1:          01:39:50       It's amazing. Let's do a three hour podcasts. My back doesn't fuck with me at all. Whereas if I sit in a regular chair after like three hours, I feel like tight. You know, I feel like kinked up. This doesn't do that at all, but there's a lot of sensory input. I think when you're dealing with like there's a keyboard in front of you or did you see that light? She, this clock. YoU see all these different things. You're, you're taking in your entire environment, you're feeling the gravity of your body pulling the chair. There's all these things that your brain is calculating and if there was some people next to you there were screaming and yelling, it'd be really hard to pay attention to what you're saying. Like sometimes we do these podcasts and they'll be unloading trucks and we'll hear the trucks. The background.

Speaker 9:          01:40:29       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:40:29       we're here. The hydraulics and the engines and shit and it's distracting. It makes you wish that it would go away because then you'd be able to formulate your thoughts without any resistance with less resistance. RIght? Well, when you're in that tank, that is that, that that's that state at its best because there's nothing coming in. There's nothing coming in. It's just your mind. There's nothing coming in and when you get to that place where there's nothing coming in, it's beautiful. You just, you get a real chance to like go over shit. Creative stuff or personal stuff or you know, problems like if you play a game, if there's anything that you do where you constantly working on it, like some guys play golf or some guys you can get in that tank and just think about all the various things. Various aspects of anything you're trying to concentrate on and it offers you this window of concentration. It's just uNavailable any other way.

Speaker 1:          01:41:20       I mean I definitely need to try it because I've heard a lot about it, but I never really knew what it was and I didn't really know how you would go about doing it. Super easy. Another thIng too, it's like who do you ask, you know, and that's with anything like right now there's less of them than they should. There should be all over the place and people are starting to open a business. It can be a place where you just go, like they have, um, they have them. There's a bunch of them that are popping up. There's a couple of them in California but only a couple. But I know that, um, I know that the guys that run on the map, but thinking about starting one and I know that crash is opening up a bigger one in westwood. It's just very under as far as like the amount of demand.

Speaker 1:          01:41:58       It's very underutilized. That demand is under tapped into because I think a lot of people would like it at burbank. One's still there. Yup. Soothing solutions, which is in burbank, which is where I first went in like 2002 and I got hooked immediately. Like I, I couldn't. I couldn't imagine that this was something that so few people were talking about. You got to try it, try it, and then you were actually the first person. I might have heard about it in another conversation too, but you were the first person I heard talk about it extensively in detail and it wasn't this video. I heard you talking about it. One of your podcasts. Yeah. I won't shut the fuck up about it. And people get mad when you have one. I mean, it's not just that I. I'm telling you, if you don't, if you haven't tried it, you don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:42:41       I'm telling you for your own good. If I'm beating a dead horse, I apologize, but you just wanted to. Lucky sons of bitches that has one in his house. Any luck. There's a lot of people that do. They do renovations to their house and do all these different things. they spend a lot of money and there's don't. That doesn't even come into the realm of possibility. Like we've got to get a hot tub that's there. People love to get hot tub on. Mike and sue got a new hot tub. What's just come on over and we'll go sit in the jacuzzi. Oh, nice. What is this rania. I was about five grand more bob and they have these fucking stupid conversations, but if one of them said, hey man, I'm thinking about getting an isolation tank, which is like you could get one for less than now.

Speaker 1:          01:43:18       I think a company called zen float, they make one that's like really inexpensive. I think it's like 1700 bucks, like the least. The least expensive one. It's not the same as like crashes not even close. It's flimsy, but it'll work. You know, it's. I dunno, I dunno how it deadens the sound anyway, but I guess being underwater deadens the sound, you know, maybe it works great. Maybe it's enough. I'm looking at is definitely better than nothing. The kids are talking about us on twitter a little bit. Don't pay attention to that shit. No, it's great. It's great. It's being mean to you so you pay to them. They love it. Of course they do. They love us. Pistol. Fuck you up though. You can't be doing that while you're doing a podcast. We never get to talk. We'll be doing no talking on here. Kicking it.

Speaker 1:          01:44:02       I wonder what how you feel right now? You can't worry about that shit, man. Can't trust them. Can't trust them with your thoughts. Dawn of the dead. You got a dog dead shirt. Yeah, man. That's a dope fucking horror movie. That was scary as shit. Oh yeah. When that movie came out and they were going through the mall when the zombies were wandering through the mall to people don't know all these people today that are so spoiled because we've had about a billion fucking zombie movies back then with dawn of the dead was around when that first movie, that movie first came out. That was a game changer that make people shit their pants and I think that that's like, you know, I'm a big walking dead fan and you're walking just so like, you know, like

Speaker 3:          01:44:42       greg nicotero who's just like a, you know, special effects, lagging, you know, did a lot of the earlier special effects in these movies, you know, and just to see walking dead and see like just how they use real practical effects and so on. The gore is just so real looking. Yeah. So sick man. I'm just a horror movie fanatic, man. I, I've just been obsessed with horses since I was a kid. yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:45:04       me too. The only thing that bugs me about the walking dead is uniformity of their slash or sounds. What do you mean somebody up when they're killing people and stuff, you know, where they're hacking up zombies. The sounds are all the same. You know what I'm saying? A lot of variety and the sounds they make when they cut open their heads, man, they get gruesome. It's always like, it's always the same coach. you know what I mean? It's like the cat sound. Every time somebody throws something out the window, it's always the exact same, like super exaggerated. Two, I would just like a little realism, like sometimes when you hit someone in the head with a bat, it doesn't make the best sound like sometimes you just graze them and it doesn't have that, that same every time. It's like it's got a bat. The bat specialists, you know, you just know well, I've seen a lot of zombie movies pro.

Speaker 1:          01:45:54       I know if done correctly. It makes it different. Sounds like the best was 28 days later in my opinion. That's the best movie of all time. Shannon, did you see the second one? That was fun. That was really cool. It was great. Twenty eight weeks later. That was great to look. It was. There was. There was a difference in the zombies were scary as fuck. they ran at you and they could bite you and if it got in you, you would instantly turn. You know that there were some wild scenes. that scene. Spoiler alert with that chick chops or boyfriend up with the machete. She. He got bit and she goes and she looks at me. He goes, no, and she just starts attacking adam with a machete. That is dark. It's real life. Fuck. yet is joe rogan the test with real live zombie life?

Speaker 1:          01:46:41       It's not real life. It's in my eyes is real life. Joe. That was a fucking great movie, man. That was a great horror movie. You didn't. So you're, you're into like the special effects guys and everything. You know who they are. I just, I just, I'm into like, you know, art and now look at that as an art form. That's how those guys do is just, is sick. It takes a certain level of expertise and taste and uh, you know, I, I'm just a fan of that. Anybody that can do a horror movie with no cgi, I mean bravo and then still be funny and believable. It's like or tv show or anything. It's, it's, it's not easy. You know how it's really hard. These guys like pat mcgee is the guy who did the werewolf out there. Just the walked in. I was like, okay, okay.

Speaker 1:          01:47:30       I know I'm in the right place, the rick baker where, well from american werewolf in london and one of the beautiful things about that movie was that there was no. cgi was all rick baker's creation and they had to show it to you in these little flashes. They couldn't just show you so much of It like they do today. Like now. Yeah, the monster's look way better for sure. But they're showing you too much. So in showing you too much. It's actually, it actually looks shittier. Like there's a lot of monster movies where like one of the weird things about monsters, like a real monster movie is you see them so briefly before they kill you, you know, it's like, oh jesus, and then you're dead. I can sort of represented that in american werewolf in london. But you saw that thing for like a frame to frame it.

Speaker 1:          01:48:16       You were shitting your pants. The guy was running to the subway and there's a brief, like couple of frames where the werewolf's at the bottom of the escalator and it's down there and he's, he's traveling up and he sees the werewolf starting to make its way up the escalator and shit in his pants, just a couple seconds and it's gone and it's like, god damn it. It's so much better than showing people like a cgi, like those movies that are kind of fun. Underworld, that was kind of underworld movies, but they were will hour of screentime. There's A wearable if you get used to seeing it. It's like, you know, if you can tease the audience and build up that anticipation, it's like, you know, because you can, you know, do the cgi and make you know, the monster look more present in the scene. you know, it's kind of like the people aren't thinking about that.

Speaker 1:          01:49:07       Give it to them in doses, in some movies have done it, you know, dope. Like I liked cloverfield. I thought that was sick. I was, the new godzilla I thought was dope. I wasn't mad at it. It was fun to watch, kept surviving, bummed me out a little bit. I was just like, this motherfucker has the worst luck. yet the best luck ever. He keeps getting these cataclysmic situations that keeps getting out with a bandaid. Everybody else is dead. This fucking dude rises from every brushes himself off. We got to fight god's. Oh, he's not freaking the fuck out that a bridge. Just missed it. I know. He's like, we gotta get godzilla. Could've saved my family and get godzilla stone seen it. Oh my god. Is it the. It's worth seeing just for the end scene, just for the fight scene between godzilla and the other monster.

Speaker 1:          01:49:53       That's prettY dope. I wasn't expecting that. That was pretty dope. And then it reminds you that like godzilla is really about godzilla. Godzilla is a hero movie. It's like godzilla is a hero. Godzilla is a hero. So it's king kong. Those are here in movies like you can't, you can't. They're not scary movies. Like it's not like a monster movie, like king kong. You only see them in brief second. It wouldn't work. Like that's one of the main problems with like special effects and a movie like king kong. It's like it always had to be special effects from the 1930 movie. Like you got to see him all the time. It's not like this monster you briefly see for a second and then it gets you like the original alien. I mean, but that's the shit that aliens is always going to be a classic and original one was the best because you put all these sought.

Speaker 1:          01:50:38       I think they all were kind of like that though because in the environments that they were at, it was just so fucking shady like spaceships and. Well the second one was pretty fuckIng dope. That was a James Cameron one aliens. But it was different than the first one because the first one you barely saw that fucking thing. Barely saw it. It was always sneaking by the time they signed it would be on them and it would kill them and that'll be it. And then the second one, they're everywhere and they're just shooting them and killing them. Like they kill them so much easier. The first one, it was like this super intelligent thing that was sneaking up on you. It was like some super genius alien and the second one it was like this trailer park aliens and there was a million of them and theY were all idiots.

Speaker 1:          01:51:19       There were all idiots. Like the first alien was brilliant, so clever and sneaky to go or a new where people were going and it would be ambushed them. It would hide and then the second movie there were all dumb. There were just jacking them. They would just run into a room and kill four or five of them. The third one was my favorite. Really would rock the rock was. He's a nice guy, man. I met that dude once to show them like one of those a talk show type things back when he was doing that show. He was cool as fuck. yeah, he seems cool, very frIendly, but he was a bad ass in that movie. He was the only person that ever seen in that whole franchise. Go toe to toe. That's right. Go toe to toe. Wasn't winona ryder in that one too?

Speaker 1:          01:52:03       Was she in the fourth one? How many of you? I know that one was. He was in the third one, right? Am I right? I think so because that was the one she killed herself. She had the babies. Had the baby. Yeah. I'm just wanting to kill the baby and that was the one that was the one where he was down there. But the score up with the dude because he ran out of ammo was like, is that all you got? Was like fighting them. Yeah, that's right. So fucking g. Yeah, that didn't end well though for him, but you know, hey, hey, we don't make movIes like that and we don't make it. But he is poppy like in a horror movie of. I wouldn't even call it a horror movie. I was like more like a spy know throw. The first one was a horror movie.

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       Yeah, but did that, that third by the third one? It was just more like a. It didn't come off more. It was more like action insight by. But that was the only time I've ever seen in that franchise, if we dare called har, where you know, you know, the black character goes out in such a way where it's like, you know, fuck that. And you know, going out, swinging like tits, some shit like that. Come on like an alien, like dude, like come on joe rogan. You would not, you would not score up with no alien. Like yeah, we do. Do you just like shit your pants? Yeah, exactly. Let it eat you. Exactly. It's happening. So like if a puppy talk shit to you, you're like, what? That's what it's like, you know, that's what the alien is life with a person through pito.

Speaker 1:          01:53:31       Yeah. And then it became aliens vs predator. It's like, what the fuck is you to. It's a slow degradation from like one of the greatest horror movies of all time. I really scott masterpiece to like this preposterous. Just action, fun film. I mean they're fun. I didn't watch that though. I watched the alien versus one of them. One of them, I remember there was more than 1000 of them I didn't know tournament every year. How many aliens vs predators know? If I had to guess, let me guess. I want to say this. Three or 4 million predators. Don't believe this. I remember there was one. There's only to get the fuck out of here. I'm not buying that. Maybe it was a tv show. No, no. There was movies, man. There's transformers, transformers, movies. Where there three w four. If you count the cartoon. Three year four.

Speaker 1:          01:54:24       You got the touch. Isn't there a new one that's coming out or something? That's alien ware. That's the one that just came out. That already came out. The marky mark one that's been in gone already? Yeah. Not so good. Wait. No man. You gotta bring back side of the boat? Yeah, he's crazy. But he knows how to fuckIng sell shit. Ass robots. Formers are there. There's, there's the original one piece. The new ones. There's three. Okay. All right. The one that just came out with mark wahlberg. That's the third one. How many aliens? Racist predators. Is it just too too? It looks like, wow, I would have assumed there was more, man. I ain't even know. I mean, what was the alien resident? That was the one that was for dna. They somehow or another got her dna. They cloned her and it was weird cause it's happening back.

Speaker 1:          01:55:17       And then there was the atheist movie, which was weird as fuck too. I wonder if they're going to do another one. I think so. Oh yeah. Prometheans could have been. I don't know man. It's hard. Like we said, like the idea of putting together a movie, just the idea of getting all those people together. I enjoY it. I mean, it wasn't the perfect saifai movie. It wasn't the original one, but I enjoyed it. I thought it was fun and I love the idea behind it. The idea of like, that's he introduces his dna into the, uh, the new virgin planet by taking some horrible poison that breaks them down and he dies, falls into the water and then slowly but surely a natural course of evolution grows out of his dna. And that's how people are created. That's fascinating to me. I mean, it was, I mean, I ain't never seen no shit like that.

Speaker 1:          01:56:03       So I, I entertained it, I enjoyed it. Well, I think that ridley scott is brilliant and I think he's probably been thinking about this for a long time before he created this and I don't know who, who wrote the screenplay, but I would imagine all of them have been thinking about this for a long time. Like if you were goiNg to like the right way to introduce life into another planet, It'd be like just get a planet, doesn't have any life and you just inject some something, you know, some d and if it's a body especially that breaks down that bodies also got all sorts of bacteria and weird shit on it and that's going to come out when it dies and the bacteria starts eating his flesh and will they be able to transmit and, and, and go to plants or other plant matter that's on this planet.

Speaker 1:          01:56:45       Is there some primitive life that it can cling to? And, and more with some sort of a virus. So like, like diseases change people, you know, diseases can probably change all sorts of other things. Viruses and bacteria slowly mutate and morph out of this one body that comes. I mean how much, how far can a body go for body rotted if there was a planet and that planet had no biological life and he brought a body and he just threw it there. All it has plant life. Is it possible that that could somehow or another have enough fuel from eating that body and figuring out how to subside off plants, that they would figure out some sort of a way to, to become a viable life form on a planet. Is that outside of the realm of possibility that stoner talk? is it. I mean, I mean, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:57:35       I mean how is the biggest too? I don't think it's too crazy even. And then if some other dude landed on that same planet and then got sick from this bacteria that was created by the body that was left behind before then he takes it back to his plan. Everybody gets fucked up and they all die. And then the planet where the bacteria was, that bacteria is figured out how to form a civilization and as wifi and they've spread out and become. People call themselves humans. Yeah. If you get too high you can think some really stupid shit and you can talk about it on a podcast like I just did.

Speaker 1:          01:58:11       But everybody's fascinated by that subject of aliens. The, the idea of aliens creating people like a movie like prometheus's. Because I mean Like it's entertaining that kind of play with that idea, you know, for a minute. Yeah. It's entertaining to think that someone's gonna come visit to. I mean everybody loves aliens. Yeah. I mean even given except predators, if you live in an. I don't fuck With aliens at all. If you lived on an island somewhere and you're by yourself just there, just you sitting around. Maybe you've got a dog, you sit on this island, you got plenty of food, but your board is fuck. Just looking at waiting for someone to come. Someone. anyone just let me see a light. Someone. I think that's kind of what's going on with us. It's like, yeah, we have each other, but the reality is we're on some weird round boat that's bobbing around in the universe and we want someone to come visit us.

Speaker 1:          01:59:06       What is this? people like us are like, hey man, most of these people suck. Can y'all come down here and fuck with us? Come take us where you teach us your ways, but, but a lot of people don't suck. RIght? I think the real thing is figuring out how to make less people suck and figuring out how to way to accept to accept people for things they've done wrong to. I just think is love man. Lot more love. Do you need that in the world? And it ways to do it without it being signed and so silly, you know? Um, it's just something that people need to do internally, you know? Yeah. It seems like an easy thing to say, right? All you need is love. But it's like, you know what it's like to be hopeful is a good thing. You know? It's a super valuable to everything.

Speaker 1:          01:59:56       If you're not hopeful you got nothing. You don't mean just your attitude determines your success in a lot of your endeavors in life, your attitude, your approach that you take to it. It's whether or not sam harris fucked me up, man. I had this dude, sam harris on the podcast and he was talking about determinism and it's the idea that no one has free will and that basically everything about your personality been formed by your interactions with your life experiences, your dna, your genetics, your neighborhood that you grew up in and that that's just no matter what, you do, an inescapable and that there is no free will. Like every decision you make is based on all the shit that's happening to fate is your fate. Well, it's not even that you in your destiny. I mean it's sort of been determined by your past experiences and the chemical interactions with those past experiences and that you're on a path and that path is like almost undeniable.

Speaker 1:          02:00:47       Which is a. It's a weird sort of a semantic argument to its because man, what's going on when you decide did not do coke anymore? What's going on? When you decide, you know what, that's it, I'm not smoking anymore, what, what is going on? Because part of me wants to say, hey, scott did some powerful shit. He stepped up and he uses willpower and he uses intelligence to realize that he was on a bad path and that's an admirable thing to talk about because it inspires people who might be on a bad path themselves to kind of like catch your, your momentum and you know, and give them confidence and it gives them confidence hearing you today with your shit together. All cool as fuck. And think about you being, you know, this guy who was doing coke all the time and didn't like it. That's um, I feel like there's gotta be something there that made you do that. I mean, this idea of pure determinism is really.

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       And I get it. I totally get it. I just wonder how much of a personal choice is just what it, what is the force that makes a person decide to do the right thing? Well, I think it goes back to what we were talking about before. If you kind of start from one place where you know, you gotta make your own way, it just kind of makes it a little bit, you know, it just, you savor it a little bit more and it means more when you get it, you know, because you had to really work in a cheap something, you know. But my whole thing is when I was a kid, I was immediately looked at as someone who wasn't gonna amount to shit. So like, you know, they started talking about starting from the bottom. That's the bottom. When motherfuckers look at you as a human being and be like, oh he, he's not going to amount to anything.

Speaker 3:          02:02:36       But they know that's what teachers, you know, that's what your peers, you know, that's what certain people in the neighborhood may think of you, you know, because of whatever, whatever reason, whatever. You know what I'm saying off just you just being in a certain environment, you know. So you already had that against you, right? And then you, you don't want to conform. You don't want to be a statistic, you know. And that's kind of like what my thing was, you know, I just didn't want to be another nigga out here last and shit and do you know what I'm saying? Like, and, and that was, that was what I, I made that choice at that time, you know, and, and I knew that me making that choice will help other people see that they can make the choice because I was also inspired by, you know, some people that were in my space that weren't falling into other shit.

Speaker 3:          02:03:25       It might've been like one of my homies that was like, you know, in the sports and like, you know, get good grades and play sports and wasn't caught up in some shit. And I was like, man, this dude got some goals here. You know, I might not be in the sports but this dude right here has some type of goal cause he don't want to turn up like this because we got that option too. Right. You know. So it's like, it was just a lot of things I was able to. Then I was the youngest of four. So, you know, I was able to just kind of be young and look at my older siblings and kind of learn what not to do and that's kind of why they use that whole, like I'm your big brother phrase in my music because I feel like, you know, even when mistakes I've made that big brother is supposed to do like I'm supposed to to make some mistakes so you can learn, you know, and then those kids will learn and then they'll make their own mistakes. Then there'll be a bunch of other kids that are learn, you know, it's like a system, you know it. And I kinda like, you know, I liked that I'm that person, you know, I like to take that, that whole big brother thing too, that, you know, to the full extent into the music. But I really believed that I had the odds against me in such a way. And I also just felt like everybody thought I was a loser from

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       day one. That was tired of feeling like that. I was tired of people looking at me in that way. And I want it to finally find whatever it was that was my own, my calling to prove that, you know, because I tried everything else. Do you think that in some ways, like coming from a troubled background is like almost a gift because it gives you that burning fire or do you think it's like a double edge sword because it gives you that gift, but it also gives you like this whole that sometimes is difficult to keep filled. Um, do you know what I'm saying? Oh no, I see what you're saying. But it's hard to say because everybody's circumstance is different. You know, like, it could be somebody who came from money that's still got the same like, you know, dna and teachings that my mom gave me because they just have really good parents except they came from money, like it don't really matter.

Speaker 4:          02:05:25       You know what I'm saying? And it could still be drugs in the suburbs. Niggas still be all these things that one can get caught up in, in the suburbs, you know, anywhere else. So like, I, I, it's hard to say, you know, I just had and this, and another thing I was talking to somebody about, you know, because know I was raised, when I think of strength, I think of a woman I was raised by my mom, you know, and that is something that I, you know, she's someone I always will look up to how she just sacrificed everything and took care of us, you know, on a teacher's salary. And that for me it's like I got that role model. Like somebody who like could have just been like, damn, I got four kids, I need to be chasing the man and trying to find some man to come take care of us.

Speaker 4:          02:06:12       It was more like, you know, I got married, it didn't work out. Now I just need to figure it out for my kids. You know, like I just had that, you know, and, and I just kind of always looked up to my mom in that way and you know, I wanted to, I didn't, I didn't want to be a failure to her. I wanted to show her that I could be great and be as strong as she was, you know? That's beautiful, man. Yeah, it's really a beautiful thing to say. That's a cool story, man. I love that. I, I just feel like, um, there's a, a certain amount of energy that people get from wanting to prove other folks wrong. Yeah, no, for sure. For sure. And uh, it can, it can help you in some ways. It can certainly help you, but I think sometimes even like when you're talking about the benefits, you had a cocaine, like there's benefits to it.

Speaker 4:          02:07:02       It's like you could say things and do things that ordinarily wouldn't be able to do. Well, this the motivation of, of like proving people wrong. I'll show you, you know, you said I wasn't gonna be shit. I'll show you. Like you get to a certain point in time that could kind of play against you to right. Yes. It could backfire because then it becomes it for me, it becomes like an. And I definitely did my last album. I did my arm before last with that, an angry I'll show you, like full, like villainous energy, you know, and I was able to make some really great records, but it was the most aggressive music I'd ever made and some of it was the most aggressive and a lot of levels, not even in the meanwhile, but just like, you know, just the music itself and that benefited the, the, you know, what I set out to do, it all benefited, you know.

Speaker 4:          02:07:57       BuT um, I didn't, it wasn't the normal way I went about making an album so it was weird, you know, and, and it was something that I took a step back with afterwards and then drop the second album was like, all right, this one's not. So um, I don't really feel like I'm, I'm like going, you know, up against the masters, like I really have something to prove here. This is more just like about like just being at some type of peace, you know, and just having things sorted out once all the madness is all done and just kinda dislike. Now it's just like, right, right. You know, and that's why I did indicat another satellite flight because I feel like in the cup was me just figuring out how to produce, you know, and make records and then satellite fight was me having it mastered and finally putting together something that was just like fine tuned, you know, but to, in a different structure where I have like some instrumentals and then you know, you know, the kind of like interludes and then records that just completely formatted in different ways.

Speaker 4:          02:08:57       Maybe not the three verse two hook formula, maybe just one long verse in one outro and you know, maybe know who get all, maybe no drums for the first minute and 30 seconds, but there's like wraps, you know, just experiment and then try and things, you know, not that I had that expertise. We're creating a record, you know. Did you ever, um, listened to the brand new heavies? I know some records here, the brand new heavies did this rap thing where there, god was trying to remember the name of it. Um, there's a, but it was along those lines like very experimental. And this is like back in the early nineties, they did like kool g rap did one of them and it did it like some like actual music behind it. It was pretty interesting stuff. But I remember that and I remember thinking like, man, like why don't more people do weird shit with music.

Speaker 4:          02:09:50       Like how many people are thinking the way you're thinking? Like saying like, okay, how about we just do no drums for like the first minute and a half and then just start rapping and then the drums kick it. Like these kinds of things where you just like coming up with a, like just a different approach. Slightly different entry. I think people are just a little scared that they'll lose the audience's attention, which is the very real fear. It's, I get it, you know, it also goes back to what I was saying, I've just been blessed with a family that like, you know, it's into what I'm doing no matter what, you know, uh, and that's, that's just dope, you know. But the average artist, no, theY can't just experiment. And this fear where they might not sell records. And then that's bad for business and this is a business,

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       you know, um, so, you know, um, it's, it's understood why most guys don't really do it, you know, I would like to see people do it. I feel like there's, that's not an excuse. I feel like there's a way where people can be a little bit more creative and push the envelope a lot more with the music, uh, where it fits in, in a, in a, in a way that makes sense. And it's true to their, their art. Um, in their formula. I feel like, yeah, there's always a way to try something new and be innovative and bring something different to the table

Speaker 1:          02:11:07       if anybody wants to check out that. That brand new heavies that I was talking about, it's called heavy rhyme experience. Uh, and it was the brand new heavies. It was 92 way back in the day when I was, I was living in New York and my friend, goddammit, trying to remember his name, stand up, comedian told me about them. He goes, you gotta listen to this shit. These guys are doing some weird stuff. They did a duel with kool g rap. They did a, one of them with a gang. Starr was pretty bad ass that, a bunch of different collaborations. So like jazz singers was like, rap, like serious, like best of the class back then. Hardcore rappers rapping over their, uh, their ride or their music. It was pretty cool. My law. Yeah, but your point about having the fan base that allows you to fuck around and practice and take chances. That is huge, isn't it? Like this ability that you know, they, they like you as a person as well as like your music so that. And they want, they want to see where you go with it. You're always going to do your best.

Speaker 3:          02:12:09       No, it comes from a pure place to know. I'm like, they know me as the top table, say no, I'm just trying to make some cool shit that they can connect with and that's the extent every time it doesn't go beyond that and the minute it tries to just starts to get frustrating, like start thinking about a radio record to please somebody at the label. Then it gets frustrating. If I started thinking about this and that, this and it gets frustrating if I keep it just based on like, amen, this sounds gnarly and let's make sure we not too trippy and it's make sure it's not to this and not do that. But uh, effortless combination of everything all at once, you know, and, and, and that's really what these past couple of years for me have been like just mastering that technique is a producer and um, you know, really, really just going all out creatively and just trying new things because I also internally don't feel like I have anything else to prove, um, as a musician.

Speaker 3:          02:13:08       But I, I have that itch, you know, like I need to create. I feel like that's like working out for me. It's like doing reps and stand mentally fit, creatively fit, you know? Um, so when it comes time to do an album, I got some new powers I've acquired in the past year, just like, you know, from just dicking around in the studio for a couple of months is going everyday making beats. Whether I'm in the studio for five hours or two hours, I'm making something I'm making at least like on average I make about in the studio, I'm making at least two to four beat today. And when I say beats, I'm talking about completed, sequenced instrumentals that I could make records are so, like not just some sit. I started a little bit and then it's kind of cool and I'll get back to it later. I have probably like a baker's dozen of those in one session, but I'll have like four that are officially.

Speaker 3:          02:14:06       Like all these jams are dope. I'm going to sit and live with these and see what comes up. So when you sit down to write music, do you, do you sit down and do you have an idea in your head or do you just let it come to you while you're there? Like how do you know how to start? Um, it, it comes different every time. It doesn't, um, it depends. It can be a baseline that I'm thinking of that inspires me or it could be me not have anything in my mind. And just going through the sounds a or it could be like, you know, a rhythm I heard or you know, anything, it could be a movie I'm watching, I like to, you know, produce while I'm watching movies with the sound off, um, in, that kind of helps me with scoring, you know, when I get into the scoring and you know, doing that as my next step.

Speaker 3:          02:14:56       I want to get more into scoring movies and sound design. Um, but it's all, for me, it's all just experimentation and just seeing what happens and you know, it's not any pressure. And when you hear a beat, like when you're making a beat and you're creating it, you hearing lyrics. Are you hearing? Yeah, I'm hearing. I mean here's, you know, when I, when I'm hearing something I hear a completed right? So when I'm starting to record and I feel like I got some of my or I saw like, I feel like in this back to what you were talking about because you know, I feel like, you know, time doesn't really exist. So an hour from now it's happening right now. Right. So there's songs that are created that I haven't made yet, so when I'm in the studio I feel like I have this small like peek into this other world and this window that I can hear the song, but it's my job in the present to find the pieces to make it so.

Speaker 3:          02:15:55       And sometimes it might come out exactly like what I'm hearing and sometimes it might not, but it's never, it's never really spot on. You're not just here glimmers of what the song completed sounds like until it's completed and then it's just everything's perfect. But that's how I can sit there and listen to a mix and be like, something's off. Because in my completed version, you know, it's like a coloring book. Every record starts off in one way, just blank and I'm just filling in all the colors and then there's one color still missing. You know, that's what's happening in the final, in the ninth end. And you know, when we're mixing the album, I mean there's still some colors that just not in there yet. And then I'm going through

Speaker 4:          02:16:29       sounds and I find the colors and everything's full and I'm cool or I might not find the exact color, but some close enough I'm fine. And like that's literally where it's at, where you have to make the executive decision, like, all right, I'm done with this or I'll be sitting for another two weeks trying to sit with this mix because I'm really anal about it and if I don't just back away and let it be, you know, we'll never hear any news. That's a fascinating insight into the creation of music. So I don't, um, I don't know anYbody that does that like, well where they could tell me about the entire process from the beginning to end. So it's interesting to get a window into that world because I always wondered, I always wondered, like, I know jj never writes his lyrics down. It keeps them all in his head.

Speaker 4:          02:17:08       Do you do that or do you actually write them down somewhere? I'm not. Sometimes I'm sometimes. I mean, a lot of hooks are in my head, but I need to write certain things down to make sure I'm making sense. I used to do a lot of my earlier stuff just off the dome, just freestyle and shit, you know? And sometimes that works good with melodies. I do that a lot. I'll go in there and just flows and try different things like that and melodies. But it's really just a combination. It's never the psych, you know, always like writing off the dome, like some ballots out. Right? Completely off the dome. You know, I don't need paper for a ballot, but like turn off the dome. Yeah, that's a great term. I'm gonna use that from now on. Whenever there's a joke that I have this written down anywhere it's going to be offered dome that that was the end.

Speaker 4:          02:17:57       I feel like that it kinda like, you know, gets people to understand that this is something, this, this spontaneousness of it, you know. Is that some turn that rappers use all the time or is that your term off the dome? Is that yours? Yours. I like to say I know the guy came up off the dome. It's a very popular phrase amongst it all came out of kid company. I'll take it. They get. I'll start spreading that rumor. You're essentially you're open, whatever. Which way ever comes. You just show up, you show up and you put in the work you put in the work creating to be to put in the work, come up, coming up with lyrics, whatever way it comes up, whether it comes up all in your head when it comes up, writing it down on paper and the sessions are really me and my engineer in and occasionally I have like my brother from another mother, dr jean is coming through who was in a band that I came up with a couple of years ago that you know, we kind of just put together because we wanted to try something outside of the world.

Speaker 4:          02:18:55       We were already making music in, you know, it's, this sessions are really small. It's not like I got 20 dudes in there. They're kind of sad sessions were really sad and probably not sad. Why? Always wondering, I feel bad for me like, oh got nobody in town. But then, but then like, you know, like I'm in there like a mad scientist. Like, you know, I'm inventing, it's not like, you know, an inventor don't get 20 motherfuckers in his lab. Why he invented shit niggas is still is shit. or they'll, you know, rack focus and you know, distract him. He got. I find that when you have your friends in the studio, you got, you know, a couple guys on worldstar, couple of guys on twitter, a couple of guys over here and everybody's talking about what's going on over here and what's going on in here and you're trying to write this song.

Speaker 4:          02:19:40       You get distracted. You like, what happened all hell naw, that's funny. Bunny, next to you know, it's two hours have gone by. You still working on this record, you had some last. But when you came to the studio for is not done yet. Right? You know, and there's money being spent and it's time. Time is of the essence. This is what we hustled and worked hard for. You know? And I have to, I had to remind myself is like, man, this has turned into a fucking party. Like we're here for work. So I also have this like really gnarly work ethic. Like, cause I've been working since I was 15. My first job was wendy's. I remember why I wanted to work. It was because I wanted my own shit. I was tired of asking my mom for stuff and also didn't think it was fair to ask my mom for stuff because I know we didn't have much.

Speaker 4:          02:20:21       So you know, I just at work for me is always like one of those things that's very important. Yeah. But like there was also some jobs that I didn't fucking take seriously, like american apparel, you know, where I was coming in late and I didn't give a shit. And then like when my boss fired me, like he took me to this office and kind of told me. And, and when he said he's like, I'm gonna have to let you go. I was like, yeah, I figured that, you know, because I didn't give a fuck, you know, it was like, now I can go to the studio. Well it's probably work and like work on my craft and then maybe find a better paying job. You know, it doesn't have me in the fucking basement of some buiLding, you know, sweating my ass off for clothes.

Speaker 4:          02:20:59       Everybody says you should always do your best at every job you do. A champion in life as a champion and everything they do. So if you're going to mop floors, do your best to my peers, my the fuck out of floors. That's great on paper. But the reality is when you're a young man, it's sometimes it's good to fuck off at something. So you know, you don't ever want to do that again. They fire you and then you learn and there's some, there's some value in that. It's unfortunate, but we don't all learn the best way. Sometimes we got to get fired from american apparel. At least I didn't get fired for like stealing something. I got fired for being a shitty landscaper, scalp and people's lawns that fuck somebody's emotions and that would hurt my feelings if somebody just was like the word around town that I've been, you know, my main bread and butter I've been doing, investing my life in shitty yet.

Speaker 4:          02:21:47       Yeah. I wasn't invested in being atlanta mayor. Not toddler boy landscaper. Yeah, I know. I know what you're saying, man. It says there's a completely different thing when you're creating your own stuff when you're working for yourself, then it's like a focus, like an obsession almost type focused. Like the laser beam. I love that term. The lab too. That's one of my favorite terms for the rap, the rap world. They love talking about being the lab, creating material who are like an inventor scientist, you know, and it's, it's kinda like I treated and every sense of the word in every sense of that, that, that, that, that term. I asked him, no lab. It's like where I'm working, it's working and almost don't like playing around and in the studio like that, like because it is a place for work, it is an office, especially if you're trying to write, if you're trying to write things there too as well.

Speaker 4:          02:22:38       He tried to write lyrics and dudes are all jumping around and not even know what if I'm not even just me sitting there and I might not have an idea yet. even if I might just eating silence. Right, right, right. I might just need fucking silence for a little bit. Yeah, I don't, I've never been to any sort of a recording studio where anybody was doing anything like serious like that. But I would imagine it's very difficult to avoid the party. It's like, hey, we're in studio and guys come to visit you come on by, come to visit. We did that. So it's like I did that now I've been doing that since like 22, 23 going to studios and having those moments with the buttons because in the beginning it's like you want your boys around. So I kind of got that out of my system and now it's like, all right, 30 year old scott goes with studio by himself.

Speaker 4:          02:23:23       He's got his book bag, he's in there for maybe five, six hours and then he goes home. That's smart. You know what I'm saying? And then friday night, you know like in, in, in bed by like 11, 1130 kapow fucks her. That's beautiful. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No may man. That's how you get shit done. That is how you get shit done. I'm just cycle those music videos though. When they show the recording studio, it's always a giant table. There's like all those little switches that nobody understands. Maybe you mixing board. Everybody's everybody standing in front of all the switches and then everybody's partying. Everybody's in the background, having a good time. But that could also be when the album's done and they're celebrating it because that's what also happens. like when I'm done with the say that's a finished maybe eight songs and I feel like I've got the album like and I just need maybe a couple more jams.

Speaker 4:          02:24:10       You start inviting people to come here. What you got, so you have those moments too, so you might see that happen and, but, but there's a year and a half of just studio by myself before that happens, you know, like I don't really. And maybe a case that had one or two friends, you know, maybe some one of my director friends or, or um, my fellow actors. So I just kinda want who have never really got a chance to be in the studio, come by and just see, get to experience, but they're not in. They're distracted me there just watching and paying attention and want to just be a fly on the wall, see how it works. Yeah. Well a lot of people are really curious about it because it's a, it's almost a sort of a mysterious type of creativity if people aren't involved in. Especially the creating of music is such a cultural, uh, it's such a cultural influence. So sort of powerful Influence like music has. It inspires people. Like when you listening to music at the gym, it can make you work out better. Like you put your headphones on and you play some awesome songs. You don't give a fuck that you're on some stupid stamp machine, like a hamster. He just keep going. Yeah. And the music you, you liked the music so much. you get into it and it's only, it's in your head, drowning out everything else. Sometimes you don't realize how heavier breathing until you know, you

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       take the earplugs out, you're like, holy shit, be getting it in. Working here. It's because of nothing else like hits you like that. Like people's words. They don't sustain that way. You can't like read incredibly passionate essay and it sustains you through a workout like that. Like it needs to be just something that like this. Nothing like music in that respect. It has, it has an impact that very few things do. So that, that process of creating it is always fascinating and mysterious to people like me that don't have any musical talent at all.

Speaker 3:          02:25:56       Yeah, I see it. Um, I, I just approached it in a different way because I'm just, I do feel like I'm just, every time I'm in the studio it's like, um, me just, you know, trying to create the uncreated and it's a very private thing sometimes, you know, I want to, I want to be able to, you know, have my privacy when I do that. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:26:22       Yeah. No, I totally. Do. You do all your writing and everything and the studio or do you sometimes sit at home? Oh, it comes whenever, man. I'll be in the shower. Do you have any of the shower? I'm thinking of some shit, you know. Do you ever use that a note app on the phone, on your phone? Were you talking to it? I'm recording memos. Yeah, a lot. A lot of the time. Not even that. I mean the note app, you know, you can talk to it

Speaker 3:          02:26:43       had a voice recognition. No, no, no. I just kinda see if I'm recording something, some melody. I'm thinking of something, I'm not thinking of wraps like days. It's less about that now and it's more about like, like just melodies and coming up with songs and structure. You want to hear the sound and then the lyrics come next Because the music is just going to tell me what to say, you know? Wow. That's fucking wild. That's so cool. Now how much of your creation is done under the influence of marijuana? Man, I don't smoke to create. I've come up with a lot of shit sober sometimes when I'm fresh. Waking up in the morning, like sometimes the most ideas at like 8:00 AM. Sometimes people say that

Speaker 1:          02:27:27       writers like Stephen King I believe does all of his writing in the morning. I think he doesn't like nine to noon every day.

Speaker 3:          02:27:32       Yeah. It's like man, I'm fresh in the morning with something, some melody and it usually comes, is walking through the house making breakfast and you know, uh, it can be whenever dropping a deuce, you know, I come up with just melodies here and there and I record them all if something really catches me because If I don't record them immediately then I lose them. So I, you know, I got to record them somehow, but it's, it's very, um, I'm always, I'm always thinking about music as much as like I like to deny it and go shoot a movie and shit and, you know, I always think about music. I'm obsessed with the idea of just making, you know, the most beautiful songs that like, you know, really make people feel some type of comfort or some type of understanding because the world is so fucked. And

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       uh, you know, I just really am obsessed with that idea. I think I'm always going to be anomalous, just trying different, different ways of doing that. You know. Uh, we did the rap shit, we did the rock album. Now I'm just trying to be disliked weird instrumentalist, you know, and I don't really know when that's going to be, but I'm just really, I guess in the process learned not to produce better too, which is something that I've been trying to. I always want to be better. So it's good to be learning and getting better as I'm creating. Do you do any other things other than music? Do you have any other hobbies or things that like I'm also get locked into a, I like design and sometimes like a, I wouldn't look at myself as like a fashion designer, but you know, if an opportunity comes around I'll do a collaborative to you like design clothes, like clothes?

Speaker 4:          02:29:12       Yeah, like I've done a, about five t shirt collaborations with bathing ape. Um, I used to work there. That was my last job before I got famous, you know, so like I have roots back in New York and that was pretty much one of those. The only job I've really kept in touch with and you know, that I went baCk to and, and you know, did some things for the fans. So you just seemed to creating shit. It doesn't, you know, it really for me, I'm starting to write a little bit more. It's just staying creative, right? Like realized like a book or like blog entries. Like what do you mean? Like a tv show or tv shows, horror movies, ideas I've had in my head for awhile. I'll just start jotting them down and you know, just everything right now. It's just me expressing whatever comes to mind, you know, uh, anything that creatively strikes me.

Speaker 4:          02:30:03       Yeah. See, that's a dream job for people to be able to just come up with things all the time. Let's work on creating your entire day is spent mostly just concentrating on creating. I'm not doing anything with those things yet, but it's, it's stimulating, you know, it doesn't mean that I'm gonna have some tv show tomorrow or anything or it's just for me, it, it, it just, it's stimulating, you know, and, and shit knowing me I'll fuck around and my right, the next shit, you know, like something that yet or something that could lead me to some showing who knows, but um, and it probably also helps you, your, your creativity and the other areas as well. Right. but then on top of that, I was the king of being like, oh, I have this idea, but nah, that's not for me. Or no, I couldn't do that.

Speaker 4:          02:30:49       Um, music is my thing. No, I couldn't do that. So now I'm past that. Now there's nothing if it pops into my mind and I can fucking do it because I thought about it for a reason. So now it's just about finding time for certain projects and I'm not no rush. You know, I worried about being pigeon holed, you're saying no, I think I think I've done enough strong arm and let me get my space as an artist where I can kind of do whatever I want now at this point she reached out to me. I just want us to be good though. Like, don't get me wrong. I'm always feeling like I'm vulnerable to make some bullshit though. I don't feel like I'm invincible. and I think a lot of artists do get to that point. They feel invincible. Like I am very capable of making some weak shit.

Speaker 4:          02:31:31       Y'all motherfuckers don't hear it, you know, and he asked because I'm sitting there and making sure that this is not weak shit. Scrapping the ones that are and, and, and working on the ones that started off week, but you know, making sure that they were where they needed to be before you heard it. Um, do you have the other, like you gotta know when to abandon them? Oh yeah. You all know when that abandoned some shit immediately and certain feelings you get, you know when some shit is the right one and when it's not this guy. There's jokes like that too. Very similar. Yeah, very similar. Some of them you just gotta let go. Yeah. And you can't infer songs is, it's much more emotional to let go some shit that you like because it might be on the right track to being something gnarly.

Speaker 4:          02:32:06       Like she put it on the shelf. Maybe say key visited. Yeah. I go back every year. I go back and listen to the shit that I made the year before. Do you categorize them? Do you, do you make notes or do you use. They're all numbered. Just number. you just say you go back and you go, okay, this is from 2013. Let me just listen to what I was doing. MY uh, my engineer, I'll just tell him, pull up everything and we'll just listen to things one by one flag. The ones that are good and are there ones that You know, because that's the thing, you always got to give yourself a break and uh, it's always good to listen to stuff with fresh years. I find uh, And also, uh, to just gIve you your, your brain a break because for me, I'm sitting in the studio for hours listening to the same old shit, like the same old beat, you know, that you're workIng on, you know, so it's kinda like you need to back off of second and like I like to, you know, work on a record, bounce him, whatever, you know, bouncing means, kinda compressing all those sounds to one track to make that mp3.

Speaker 4:          02:33:02       That's what you bounced out a fire, that's what you guys get on your ipod is a bounced down file of all of all the files. So I bounced down everything everywhere. The ones that I feel like we're close to being finished or reasonable enough for me to listen to and write to. and um, I won't listen to him that night. I'll wake up the next day and while I'm making breakfast I might listen to them that with fresh ears and I'll be like, aw shit. Most of the time it's like, whoa, this is dope. Because the night before I'm just saying hi, this shit sucks. I don't know, I'll listen to it tomorrow, you know, because I've been in our. I've been in the studio for hours by myself and I don't have nobody to tell me like, yo, that shit is fresh. It's just me and my own expertise and just like right now I think this is all shit, but I'll bounce it down and I'll just do it tomorrow, see how I feel, and almost every time I do that, if I bounce it down it's like dope and a lot of this shit can be for someone else and not for me.

Speaker 4:          02:33:55       Do you? It's the thing about music too, it seems like when, when there's a song that I really like at any genre, it's like I really like it. I like it at first and then I started really liking it. When I keep hearing it, I hear it a bunch of times and as out here, like the fourth or fifth time. That's what I'll really get into it. Yeah, and it's interesting how music does that. Like there's, there's songs that you need hear a bunch

Speaker 3:          02:34:17       of times. That's why people don't like new shit. Like at the rolling stones go on tour. Like they let her play those fucking classics. Nobody wants to hear some weird shit. Even writing keith, they may, I learn, I learned the hard way, you know, you go out and you do coachella and it's like alright, I got fucking coachella to do this. Come with the hits, let's give them this, give them the joints. Didn't want to hear you know, I'm not going to go out and coachella and be like, alright guys, so I know you guys know these songs as they are produced on the album but we're doing them all tonight and I'm doing them all in different key so they won't even be formatted how you remember him. But I promise you, you have me tonight on this stage for at least an hour and a half and it's just the worst show ever, you know?

Speaker 3:          02:35:03       Yeah. When you go and do a new show, like if it's totally new thing. Do you do or smaller clubs you fuck around with like rock clubs? Were you talking about like, like if you're gonna work the first time you're going to do a, a live perform any of your new material tour tour. Because the tour is like, for me it's the fan club, you know, I could go up there and fumble is many times I want all night and my fans are just like, it's all good. This clubhouse right where you're supposed to fuck up, you know when you go and do coachella, there's no time, there's no time to fuck up. Everybody's watching. It's like the clubhouse. We dick around. It's like, you know, when a comic goes to like the, the, the, the, the, the um, the club used to do standup at before he blew up because he knows those people.

Speaker 3:          02:35:49       He could be himself there and can try new jokes. You know, that's the same deal. That's how I approach tour. You know, I don't let press in unless they buy a ticket. You want to come to my show and fucking buy a ticket because most of the time you get the press, their ticket in their writing and talking shit. You're giving motherfuckers a free pass to come see your shelter. They can talk shit. It's like, no asshole. You want to talk shit about my show, you're going to pay for it. Can't get any attention unless they talk shit. That's a, that's a big issue with folks. But it's like a, like, you know, whatever the case may be, I'm going to make you work hard to get in there to talk shit because it is a fucking membership. It's like the only people I want in my concert of people that really give a shit about what we're doing as artists, you know, and, and, and you know, understand me as a human being, you know, so say a very psychedelic point of view.

Speaker 3:          02:36:38       Yeah. I mean, because it is at the end of the day like we were talking about before, it's all an experience, you know, and, and, and show is even more so because it's bringing the songs to life and I'm there. It's like a play theater. Like I'm out there, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm the showman for tonight and I'm taking you to a place. It's kinda like leave your worries behind. Yeah. It's like I don't really want kids to know the average hip hop show. It's like you see your favorite artists come out at best performing it hits. They're almost there but you can't touch them. But it's just dope to, to know that you're in the same building with them. And then that's the end of it. And that's what you take. It's like man, it was, we were in the nosebleeds but it was really nice. Was there tonight would that my favorite rapper or whatever.

Speaker 3:          02:37:20       This shit with me. It's more therapy. I'm confessing some things through song. You see me, you know, confess These things. You see the emotion as unperforming, you know? And then there's kids out there that are connecting with it in such a way where it's like, man, I already connect with this dude, but he's performing it in such a way where he means it even more. He's singing it in a way where he means that even more in this environment, you know, it's like, it's a different experience. And I love giving people that experience, you know, I love connecting with them in a way where, you know, everybody at that concert is paying attention and they're there because they, they, they want to experience something. Right. You reached out to me about people asking questions about psychedelics fielding questions about psychedelic. Yeah. Yeah. What was the, what was the motivation behind that?

Speaker 3:          02:38:13       Uh, just I saw a tweet from a young man, he hit me up and he was just simply asked me, uh, you know, how much you should take some shrooms. And I, I don't know, I was just, I just saw it. I was like, oh, okay. I gave him a response and I didn't think nothing of it. But then I saw a lot of people responded and I was like, oh, this is cool. And other people were asking me questions and then I was like, holy shit, this could be bad, could be really bad. But it's like, you know, what the imu, big brother's shit, like if they're gonna do drugs and they want to know about, at least asked me to come to me, you know, I'll give you the, the real shit, you know, you want them to ask. Somebody asked me, um, and that's kinda how I looked at it and it ended up being this thing.

Speaker 3:          02:39:01       But then I know that you talk about psychedelics and you have specifically talked about dmt because I answered the question about dmt and that's why I was like, man, we should talk about this with joe, you know, because I know that I, I mean I can't sit down with anybody and talk about dmt. Even some of my friends, I've told them that I've done it and they have like looked at me in a way where it's like, you know, it's like, whoa, you did. It's a game changer man. But that lets me know that there's people that don't understand it and they're not educated about it. And so they just kind of hear these stories and that's also why I was like, man, it would be dope to if we just sat down and talked about it and educate some people because I just know it's, I mean, even some people are scared of acid. It's a scary thing, you know, I tell people I remember this is a true story. Um, I hope so.

Speaker 3:          02:39:50       This is kind of like one of those things. I'm not throwing this kid under the bus, but, you know, it's just a reality. Um, I was at coachella, we were backstage, ran random, the wiz khalifa, uh, you know, I see him often and he was telling me he was doing shrooms or whatever and experiment with shrooms. And I was like, oh man, you should do acid. And he was just like, no. I was like, oh man. It's like the training wheels are fucking psychedelics and shit, you know. And it's likE, he's all, man, I'm fucking with that though. Just you can just tell that it was just maybe, maybe he might've known somebody who had a bad trip or he heard some bad things, but like there was like fear and I was like, oh man, it's just people. People are kind of like taken back when you say you do acid sometimes.

Speaker 3:          02:40:35       And even when I talk about it on twitter, people would be like, whoa, chill. You want some other shit? and it's like man, like, I mean, well that's the one would be really crazy. Yeah. But I don't. You can go crazy drinking too much. Yeah. It's. So I don't really. You've never had a bad trip on acid. Yeah. But it wasn't because of me was because I let some other motherfucker come into the situation that wasn't ready with his shit, you know, you know, some people come in and try to act like they do this and don't do thIs and you know, you have situations like that. But I've heard bad trip and you got dragged along because you gotta you gotta make sure everybody's cool and you want to, you know, help people out. You don't want to leave, nobody abandoned and I feel like that's the big thing with psychedelics is if you're doing it with people, no matter if you know them well or not, you don't want to really leave nobody hanging, you know, and you want to write. You want to try to find that common ground because everybody tripping, you know? And it's like, you know, everybody at the end of the day we're tripping and it's scary because somebody gets to be like one minute he was trying to kill me. What? No, think back. I've never had no shit like that and I'm pretty sure people have dealt with that though. You know, that's the thing.

Speaker 1:          02:41:49       But acId is always the hardest stories. Like we were talking about pink floyd, like the dude from pink floyd, which, which one of those guys went fucking crazy. What the fuck's his name? Jeremy. Jeremy. You don't know. Yeah. One of the dudes from pink floyd went fucking crazy. that's what shine on you. Crazy diamond was about him. That song was about him going fucking crazy from doing too much asset. Hold on, shine on you crazy. Diamond. I know part of the information, I don't want to quote like I know it all. Yeah. In wikipedia days, the man. Yeah, it was written. Okay. Shine, shine on you. Crazy. Diamond is a nine part pInk floyd, nine part pink floyd composition, which is what andre waters, Richard Wright and David Gilmore, and it's attributed to former band members. Sit barrett. Syd barrett was the one who went bond. Nan was allegedly allegedly,

Speaker 3:          02:42:38       but that album cover was, is so fucking sick too. Shaking his hand and dudes on fire. Yeah. Yeah. So fucking gnarly.

Speaker 1:          02:42:45       For real. Yeah. He, um, apparently, I don't know if that's true, the whole lsd thing, but through the it says this is the wikipedia. It says throughout late 1960 for um, for barrett, for syd barrett throughout ninth, late 1967 in the early 1968, barrett's behavior became increasingly erratic and unpredictable. Partly as a consequence of his reported heavy use of psychedelic drugs. most prominently lsd. Many reports described him onstage drumming one cord through the entire concert or not playing at all. Had a show at the fillmore in san francisco during a performance of interstellar overdrive. Barrett slowly detuned his guitar. The audience seemed to enjoy such antics. Unaware of the rest of the bands. Consternation interviewed on the pat boone showed during the tourist sids replied to boone's question was blank and totally mute stair according to nick mason. Nick, what? Sid wasn't into moving his lips that day, so he was just. He was just going. He was just going. He was my hero. He went out there for whatever reason. I mean, I don't use my hero. Yeah, he might've lost it. Shit. who knows? Or he might've just got tired of was like, fuck this probably. Yeah, probably on acid all the time and just couldn't realize he was quitting pink floyd for acid.

Speaker 1:          02:44:08       That new girl shoes is still. He was still in that old relationship. well, we were talking about cigarettes earlier and in a world where cigarettes are legal and they kill half a million people in this country alone every year, it's preposterous to think that we're too much of a group of fucking babies to deal with psychedelics. We need like centers, we need centers, we have educated people with degrees and understand that the human body doctors who could administrative people can take care of people and have them in these really comfortable environments where people go and they they, they have the possibility in a professional setting of experiencing these things and that should be a part of normal human culture because you've benefited from it. I've benefited from it. Brian has kind of benefited from it. Debatable as he holds up the cigarettes. Camels smokes. Camels. Camels. Silly bitch. Do you think you can get hypnotized?

Speaker 7:          02:45:07       I don't think hypnotized or I don't think I can get hypnotized now to smart. Yeah, I think I would just think about it the whole time. Overthink about ira. This guy's trying to hypnotize me right now. I could hear his voice. All right. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:45:19       I think. I think. I think you could do it bro. They say iowasca is one of the best ways to quit. Iowasca supposed to be like a really good way to quit smoking with anything. If you want to wake up and I'm alive, thank god, but you go through it, you go through the journey and it's just so self examined. Tory. Even the regular dmt trips I've had, they're intensely self examine it, like the, the, the insight that you have in your own life and your own world, your own mind. It's just, it's, it's scary because it's so. It's so clear. The clarity. So bizarre. It freaked me out, man. I'm, I'm,

Speaker 7:          02:45:56       I'm not gonna lie, not done. You know, I've done my fair share of asset. You know, I'm big on psychedelics. Dmt, some next level shit, but I've had nothing like this. And you try to explain

Speaker 3:          02:46:10       it and you can't because there's nothing you could just know. You can't find the words to explain sometimes what you see, uh, you know, you a little bit more educated about it than I am. You could probAbly find the words, you know, like sometimes you fucking talk like a scientist and she following like, but you know, bullshitting. But you know, at the same time, like for people that might not be educated and still hard for me to, you know, put the words what I saw, but you know, the reality is, is what you're seeing is everything literally melt down and reconnect, deconstruct and reconstruct around you and your eyes are wide open. and it literally, for me, that was the only thing that freaked me out. The fact that my eyes weren't closed, but my environment was completely altered immediately, almost before I could even exhale all the smoke before I was even leaning back on my couch. I mean the room rearranged itself and became something else in it. I felt happy.

Speaker 1:          02:47:14       Graham hancock has a very fascinating way of looking at it and what he thinks. The way he described it to me, I never heard anybody describe it this way before, but it made total sense. He said, everyone says you're taking drugs and it's distorting your perception of reality, and that's what you're saying. he goes, that is a possibility. Another possibility is that like a telescope needs to be tuned in to see a far off star. That what you're doing by taking this chemical that your brain already makes, you're tuning into something that's ordinarily impossible for you to see and that there is this dimension that is around you all the time and it is filled with intelligent entities and he said, we must consider that that is also a possibility and that is a fascinating way of looking at it because we really don't know what's happening and the people that aren't blown away by it or just the people who haven't done it. If you've done it and you're not blown away by it, I don't understand. You know, maybe There's supposedly some people who don't have a reaction to dmt. There's a small percentage of people that try it where nothing happens.

Speaker 3:          02:48:22       Went two separate occasions where a first time it didn't work for me and in the second time it did. Was the first time bad stuff or do you just not think the first time we didn't administer it? Right. And then the second time it was downright. The second time it was the second time was also I hit it extra hard because I was a mistake. It's going to work this time, so I had this really like I'm at man, man. You know what, that shit was crazy

Speaker 1:          02:48:53       story is the same as yours almost. It's, it's slightly different in that I did it the first time I did it. I was pretty fucking profound, intensely profound and I thought I'd hit the center of the universe. I thought I'd. And then the second I did it,

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       I blew way past that spot to some complete new place where there was no avoiding it, no denying it. And I went, oh this is it. And then that's the spot I've been kinda going to pretty much every time since then. But the first time was unbelievably profound. Way more profound than anything else and I didn't really even get all the way through me. I didn't, I haven't been through yet. Like that world that you're talking about. Like I haven't went, like I couldn't even get out of whatever was happening in that room in my house because it was. I don't know if I want to keep your eyes open. I, I, for the most part, my eyes were wide open because I was so intrigued that like, yeah, I've seen a bunch of shit around you. Yeah. But then when I closed my eyes and I got over that, then I was a whole nother experience and that was this tunnel like thing and then it was dark.

Speaker 4:          02:49:59       It was more, some evil shit happen in there. It didn't freak me out too much. But you know, because I know like that's another thing people like as long as you, if you see some shit that might freak you out, this remember you are on drugs, you know, lIke some shit, you know or you're seeing demons for real. Yeah. But they can't harm you, you know, just sit your ass still don't fucking move and you'll come back hopefully. Hopefully. Hopefully. But this was more just like some, some weird shit happened and I didn't go down that rabbit hole too far. I'm just kind of opened my eyes back open and just kinda still shit was weird. But I kid you not joe, as soon as I was kinda like I'm all right, I'm over this. Then I came back and it was kinda like, well, I could describe as like an overlapping a little bit of that world in reality.

Speaker 4:          02:50:50       Still a little haze of it where there was shades of the other world. It was almost like I saw a face in the corner of my room, just kind of dipped back off until the walls. Yeah. I saw like these kinda like spidery things kind of coming out and my grammy and onto the ground. But that's the thing though at this point in my room was back to being it being a room, you know what I'm saying? Like I was back to reality, but it was like this, this, this, you know, the world was still. It's like, uh, the echo from where I was at was still kind of in the room, you know, and it hasn't worn off yet. Yeah. Well next time you do it, don't do it that way. We do it. Just keep your eyes closed and let it go. Don't keep my eyes open.

Speaker 4:          02:51:37       No, I don't think so. Keeping the eyes open part is, uh, probably fucking with you. Oh man, I was, you know, they say the best way to do it isn't a really comfortable. I mean I loved it though. It was, it wasn't absolutely positive, but I didn't go to, I didn't go to that world that you, you said you were going to because my eyes were open. It was really just, I was just so intriguing. I wanted to spend crazy when I got done I wanted to paint everything I saw because I just had never seen that like that and I never want to paint. Do

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       alex grey's paintings. Yes. And that's the thing, but I don't know if it was my shit was going to be like that because I didn't go to that world. Right, right, right. But just whatever you went to, it'd be different. But like, you know how you were saying like, or some of those paintings are just like some guy and it's like all this energy around it and so on. These colors. I didn't see that. I didn't get to yet. You probably. Yeah. Well most people don't get enough, you know, let's just put it. Like I said, my first experience, I thought it was pretty fucking amazing and it still wasn't nothing like the second one, the second one, I was like, oh, I get it. That was rIdiculous. I thought I was already there because what I'd seen was still so much different than reality.

Speaker 1:          02:52:43       I was like, wow, this is the craziest thing ever. But it was not even close to the actual craziest thing. So you close your eyes every time. Yeah. Yeah. Never have opened my eyes before. And what happened? She patterns everywhere. It's like it's too much. I think there's the conflict of information. There's the information you're getting from your eyeballs. There's two different trips. Yeah, and then there's what's going on in your imagination or your mind, whatever the imagination is not even to imply that it's not real or it's not a real experience that imagined the term imagination is a lot of negative connotations to it, but whatever it's going on, when you got your eyes closed, you're not. There's no physical objects in front of you. You've seen all this stuff happening in your, in your visual field with your eyes closed, but you're not, you know, there's, there's nothing you reach out and grab.

Speaker 1:          02:53:27       So that's why I'm saying imagination, but whatever you're doing when you're doing that is real and I don't know what it is that I don't know what the fuck is happening, but it's real. Do we're out of time. Oh man, it's over. We did three hours dissolve by. Thank you. Really appreciate it. And I think it was cool for people to get a unique insight into your creative process and that was really powerful. All the shit that you shared about your personal life and the coke and everything. That was amazing, man. Thank you. Thank you very much. So yeah, anytime. And a ladies and gentlemen, that's the end. He dirty fox. So, uh, we will see you very soon. Many more podcasts this week and until then, go fuck yourselves. You guys much love to everybody. Big kiss. That was awesome. We definitely.
