Speaker 1:          00:00:00       And we're live. Are you going to update the people out there? No. Oh, you shut your phone off while you're a professional drone racer. Good. Going. Well, it's going on. Um, everything. It's all pretty weird out there. It is very weird out there. We were just talking about how weird it is out there, um, before the podcast about how it just seems like it's very difficult to keep it together during these times and to keep a reasonable position and to handle all of the pressure of all the people that get upset at anything you do left or right in the middle. Centrist your two centers due to left you to write your unreasonable. You're to reasonable. You're too nice. You're not nice enough. Well, suddenly I feel like I'm in a marriage doesn't seem like it does. I think that this is why this is the era for disagree ability.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       If you're not easily swayed because you're somehow a insensitive enough that you just want to keep to first principles wherever it is that you believe. That seems to be the best hedge against getting swept up in the madness of others. How so? Well, um, I guess when I go metacognitive I look at my yearning for group belonging and then I also watch my inability to belong to groups that say crazy things. And so those are, those are two conflicting feelings. I think sometimes when people look at me they say, wow, you're really contrarian and you have an easy time standing up to the conventional wisdom. And I don't think it's, it's, it's that true. I just think when those two things fight inside me, a dialectically the disagree ability is so strong because it's protecting a comprehensive view of the world. And so since everything already kind of fits together fairly well, I would say I'm much, it's much harder to sway me because the number of things I would have to move cognitively to accommodate a wrong idea.

Speaker 1:          00:01:55       This is quite large. It seems unnecessary, but it also seems like we should be able to disagree on things and you should be able to point out with reasonable courtesy that there's something wrong with someone's idea and it not become a big personal thing. But oftentimes that's not the case. Well. So a lot of the things I think that we're, we're exploring or what I would think of as Heuristics, they're sort of rules of thumb that worked fairly well within some domain of definition and we've gotten so many of these conflicting rules. I mean the rules of thumb themselves, conflict. So for example, he who has the, his last, uh, conflicts with, um, nothing ventured, nothing gained or something like that. Uh, sorry. Um, it's a, I forget know there's the cautionary. I'm aphorism and then there's the be bold, the aphorism. And so we don't have a good way of sorting out conflicts that occurred. The heuristic level. Then you also have heuristics

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       meant for social cohesion, conflicting with ground truth. So this is why biology is always controversial because biology is a science that tells us many of the things that we wish were true or just not true. You know, I always think about Ben Shapiro's facts. Don't care about your feelings. Well, biology cares about your feelings. Just laughs at them and stomps on them and makes them feel very sad. Well, it also tries to explain your feelings, right? Exactly. But you know, if you really understand biology, the world is so dark and so interesting and beautiful and crazy that it's very hard to recover simple ideas about how people should be once you really realized that are being apes has deep consequences. Yeah. I have a very minimal understanding of biology. But in that understanding, I've come to accept some things just about being a person that I never considered before such as all the different things that are running your decision making, like just what we're talking about.

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       Like the, the need to be in a group and all of these are probably evolutionary advantages to fostering tribal behavior. So you could all work together and feed each other. You know, this, this is always pulling at you and you know, when, when people give people hard time about virtue signaling, it is kind of gross. When someone virtue signals, you know, but we understand what it is. It's gross because we've all done it. Right? That's one of the gross things about it. When someone is just like really trying hard to act like, you know, they're disgusted by the way people behave because they would never behave like that and they just want to let you know, I'm, I'm above this type of behavior. What's most likely because they weren't above that kind of behavior at some point in their life or they're not currently really above that type of behavior, but they wish they were or the part of them that speaking is the part that's above that behavior.

Speaker 2:          00:04:47       But that's not the part that's going to be operative after 11 on a weekend at a bar. Yeah. Three shots in all bets are off. The wheels are off the wagon. So I think we don't, we don't see ourselves. We are permanently in our own blind spot because the part of us that is just and righteous and good, um, seems to know very little about the other part. What's also this thing, this need to belong and need to be accepted. Like we work to be accepted instead of work to be someone that you would want to be a part of the group instead of being like really honest about who you are and how you think and how you behave and how you operate in the world. Instead of doing that and trying to improve upon that. You try to project an image of this. Well then here's a question for us.

Speaker 2:          00:05:34       Why is vice signaling so much more powerful than virtue signaling? Vice signaling. Like a person who admits their problems, like an alcoholic who steps up and says, I've got a real issue. Could be that way. Or it could be sort of Dan Bilzerian type vibe. Like you want to know what I'm into. I'm into hot chicks weed and guns and I'm making tons of money and showing it off. Well, he's super honest right now. That's one of the reasons. And you he's bulletproof in that regard. Like you can't fuck with him. Like you can't say, hey, look at you. You're just a playboy. He'd be like, yeah, yeah. Like girls. Yeah, it works. Yeah. Um, what else? Right now I'm nice, like he's a nice guy. Talked to Dan Bilzerian. He's friendly, he's not bad guy.

Speaker 1:          00:06:14       No, I mean he, he, you know, he had a, he had this post which was a, he was I think offering a hand to a woman up the stair and said, come with me. I'll ruin your life, but it'll be fun. No, it was just like, it's so disarming and I think that this is also partially, you know, a secret to your success, which is that you're a nice guy. You're really into fighting, you know, you, you hunt elk, you're clear about which ones you're going to kill, which ones you want based on the reproductive cycle. You're, you're promoting all sorts of things that people don't want to talk about to a fairly conscious level. And it's produced an incredible level of trust in an era where all of the virtue signaling gives way. I mean, I mean if you scratch any person a enough below the surface, you're going to see that they're really warning you about themselves.

Speaker 1:          00:07:01       And so the people who are the most sort of self critical, and this is like, you know, I think I brought this up recently a on twitter about Metta honesty, where there was a in the Castro in San Francisco, there was a bar and restaurant that was advertising a free food naked servers plus false advertising. You know, it was just fun and playful. And as a result, uh, you know, you had an instant desire to, to eat there and to trust them. And so I think that in this world of virtue signaling, vice signaling is really the growth industry and that's what's working for good people because they are more in touch and you know, they are going to lie to you and they're going to do all the self interested things, but they're not going to

Speaker 2:          00:07:48       surprise you quite as much. Well, in the case of Dan Bilzerian, I really don't think he's going to lie to you. I don't think that's what he's doing. I think what he's doing is living like a guy who's got $100, million dollars and happens to be 35 years old and likes to bang hot chicks and fly around in private jets and live in some fucking house that he's got. He just bought some crazy house and like Bel Air, I guess with that weed money Jesus, he's got. It looks like you'd probably cost $100,000,000 or something ridiculous like that. It's a fucking insane house, but that's what he likes. The guy drives, likes to drive around Ferrari's and d, but he's a nice guy, so it's like, well, what, where? What's what's wrong with this picture? What's wrong with this picture is he's doing things that I look at this. This is this house. What in the holy fuck is that? Does he have a golf course on his roof? What is that? This is a fucking ridiculous house. Look at this fucking place. He gives his address out, so that is address. It's pretty hard to hide that thing. Why the fuck would he give his address? Alex? I don't think you can get there. It's in Bel Air. Whoa. Look at this house. It's preposterous. Anyway, this is what he likes, but why is that bad? I mean, look, we only have

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       100 years. If everything goes perfect. I know. What do you give a shit? Like why does everybody get a ship? But they do give a shit. They give a shit a lot because for a lot of folks that are working, you know, making a good living, making 50 grand a year, whatever. That's it

Speaker 1:          00:09:08       completely out of the realm of possibility and his lifestyle wouldn't be sustainable for them. I mean because he's taking real risks. There's no question about it. When you get everybody stoned and then you take them to fire automatic weapons out in the desert. Oh yeah. That's real risk. And also the gambling, he does a lot of like crazy gambling. Well, but this is the thing about the relationship with the unforgiving. This is partially why I think your UFC and Jujitsu life is that when you have a relationship with the unforgiving, you can say, you know that guy, that guy doesn't really know what he's doing, but then you're, you're in the ring, you know, you're the man in the arena and you find out very quickly whether or not the trash talking, you know, paid off or it didn't. And I think that many people have no relationship with the unforgiving. Like they'll take them out on a hike into the, let's say the Trinity Wilderness, and then two hours. Then they'll just sit down and say, I want to go home. Right? You're thinking like, okay, you're signaling something, but there's, there's no car service and there's, we're not calling a helicopter. You know, it just that there's this. If you live in the social layer, you're surprised by the existence of the unforgiving. But oh well,

Speaker 3:          00:10:19       one on one hand, I want to support people's ability to do whatever the fuck they want. On one hand, I want to support someone's ability to sit in front of a computer and whether you're working or you're writing code or you're writing a script or you're just a fucking playing video games, I want to support your ability to do whatever you want to do. If you. If you have the means, if you're not, you know, if your family is starving, this is what you enjoy doing. Why do I care? But as a person who's experienced a fair amount of adversity, especially selfimposed adversity, I would, I would tell you that you would benefit from it. I've benefited from it and I think you'd benefit from it too. You don't want to be that guy. The two hours into the hike says, I want to go home.

Speaker 3:          00:11:01       You don't want to be that guy. You want to be. That person just says, well, this is what we're doing and I'm going to figure out how to do this and I'm going to show character and I'm gonna. I'm going to be proud of myself at the end of this. I mean not might have to walk for six hours and when it's all over, my legs might be shaky and I might have to sit down, but that gatorade is going to taste so good. It's going to be like the greatest gatorade of all time because he's going to drink and you'd be like, oh, or are in the shit out of this. You're going to feel it. And I think we learned about ourselves through especially self. Well, any kind of adversity, you know, look, I'm coming off of being evacuated from the fires, which was for me not that difficult. You know, I'm not poor. I got a hotel, I brought my family to the hotel. We got safe, got my dog to the, to the podcast studio. And everybody's all right, you know. But for those firefighters, I mean 12 hour shifts. The blaze

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       for people who lost their homes, some of them tried to save it. There was a story about a guy in Malibu, the climbed on top of his roof with a hose and tried to fight off the fire and he got severe burns and he's in the hospital. And I mean, it's raining ash and these chunks of fucking fire on people, these embers, they're falling from the sky and this guy's trying to save his house. I mean, that guy literally went through the fires. He'll be a different person after this and no question. We've been in something of a reality drought. The number of people who have very little relationship to reality. I mean, you know, I used to live in Cambridge, Massachusetts and you'd, you'd come in from Boston and there would be the science at fresh killed chicken bones about it, man. Fresh killed chicken.

Speaker 2:          00:12:39       But like chicken mcnuggets, nobody quite knows what, what part of the chicken isn't mcnugget right? It's just some abstraction that comes to you. And so I think we've gotten very divorced. There'll all of these layers of indirection between us and the world. And when a fire happens, it's so overwhelming. We were just choking on the SF smoke, uh, in the bay area. There's, it, it, it just, it gets real after having been unreal for a very long time. Yeah, it's unavoidable. It makes you, it makes you buck up like you gotta get Outta there. Like we got evacuated Thursday at 2:30 in the morning. We were looking up. We were like, we gotta get the Fuck Outta here. I don't give a shit what you leave behind. Just go keep your body and go everything else. It's either replaceable or you don't really need it that much.

Speaker 2:          00:13:28       Anyway. Just fucking get out of there. And when you see that fire raging over those hills and helicopters dropping water on it and then another house explodes because the gas line gets hit. It's just you, you saw that, you see that you go, oh, there's not enough people in the world to save you. There's not enough fucking firefighters or cops. There's too many houses as too many people and a bunch of these houses are going to go. You've got to get the fuck out of there. And um, but there's a certain. I was with a bunch of my friends from my neighborhood and my friend Tom Segura and his wife, we all stayed at the same hotel and we felt we. There was like a tangible sense of community with this. I love this point. Let's imagine you go for a wedding and they house you with your third cousins.

Speaker 2:          00:14:14       People you barely know. If you're lucky enough that the sewage system breaks and like stuff is leaking out of the ceiling and you guys all have to do heroic, crazy stuff to save the house. You're going to be closer to your third cousin than you are to your uncle. Right? And this is this very strange feature of the world that is kind of a random arrival of diversity is very often what bonds you to some particular human being. And if you avoid adversity in groups your whole life, you probably don't realize that a, you're never fully activated as a human being or particularly,

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       you know, if, if men I think don't form groups that in some sense fight or battle or contest together. So there's this very weird fact that apparently humans are the only species that organize a contests in teams. Um, you know, this is an intrinsic feature of being human contests. Do other animals have any contests? Well, just so they spiked chimps, you know, we'll, we'll have these incredible raiding parties were very methodical and they'll, they'll attack somebody else, but I don't think that they practice it. It's like, okay, your red team, chimp, chimp, what were the only ones that do stuff like that that can communicate, right? Like dolphins can communicate, but they don't do stuff like that. Right? Or you have individual sparring, like you'll have two bears learning to play with each other, um, because it's safer to play with your brother and childhood than it is to just suddenly show up against some big ass bear and have to compete for females.

Speaker 1:          00:15:51       I had William von Hippel on a couple of days ago and he's the author of the social leap and uh, we were actually talking about this, about one of the things that made human being successful as we came down from the trees and started walking around the grasslands is our ability to organize and to work and coordinate together. Yeah. Well, you know, like African wild dogs are fairly good at this and you watch what they do in their spare time very often. They just take the piss out of each other so that they actually come to each other's age eight at a very high level, uh, in times of need. But like, you know, when you're just hanging out around the fire hose firehouse, you're, you're really just giving each other shit all the time. And so there's something about the way in which we play. I'm being kind of divergent from the way in which we behave when we actually just need each other and like, you, you need to be on that line, you know, let's say, uh, you know, throwing burlap bags and I just need you to do that thing.

Speaker 1:          00:16:51       And we were both facing something together. Uh, it does not. It doesn't have to be fighting in a militaristic situation. But I do think that, um, this is one of the weird things that's going on with all of this emphasis on care and feelings, is that often men need to give each other shit in order to form very deep bonds. If I can't tease you and if I don't know where the line is like there is this line which is like, dude, that was way too far. We all know that those lines exist and we sometimes have to go up to them and sometimes we have to experiment by going over them, but if somebody says, I don't like the way you're talking, it seems very insensitive and my response is, well, you're going to keep me from forming a deep bond with that person. You just don't know that that's how we do it. Yeah. They're shielding their. They're putting up their shield and often is to project a certain image to you. They, they, they, they want to be taken seriously. They want some respect. They

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       can't deal with you goofing on them. That's true and goofing can go wrong, but yeah, but I think that one of the things that I've been fascinated by is where did all this madness come from? And I increasingly am wondering whether it comes from social and emotional learning that started to be taught in schools around emotional intelligence. So this whole idea of eat q I think had a lot to it, but not all the bugs were worked out because a lot of things that kind of are in the neighborhood of bullying might be actually intimacy building. Right? And so if something turns into some super disgusting, deadly hazing ritual, we all say, what the hell are you people doing? But on the other hand, if it's sort of three clicks back from that line and it's, you know, there was mild discomfort. We humiliate each other a little bit and now we're friends for life.

Speaker 2:          00:18:40       Um, then you know, the fear of the hazing ritual gone wrong may actually stop people from ever actually making the really deep bonds to last a lifetime. Well, isn't that like everything else? Some people are good at things and some people suck at it. So some people are good at being silly with their friends and some people go too far. I mean, you, you experienced that. Like I've had friends who experienced that where they do a podcast on the podcast, they fuck with each other, right? And they'll have someone come up to them that they don't even know right off the street and immediately say something like, ruthlessly insulting to them. And I like, what the fuck? And uh, yeah man, you do that shit on your podcast all the time. It's like, okay, you're doing it wrong. I don't know you. We're not friends.

Speaker 2:          00:19:21       We're not bonding here. You're walking up and saying something mean calling someone about Fatso. Exactly. Yeah. It's just not good at it. And oftentimes that's a, some sort of a sign of social intelligence, a lack of social intelligence, a lack of. I mean, who knows what's going on in their home that might just be bad information from parents and they're growing up in this environment of a very low level social skills. And now what we're doing is, I mean, I think that you're spot on, we're now going to try to readjust everyone around our weakest players. Right? So now the idea is that because that can be said in a horrible way, we're not going to let anyone say anything remotely adjacent to it. Yeah. You can't do anything that would be a precursor to it. So you're just going to say, well, you see that little patch of bad cells over there, we're going to cut off your leg, uh, in order to stop that cancer.

Speaker 2:          00:20:16       It's just like, couldn't we do something a little bit more surgical? Well, and also there's some things that you're, there's a reason why we have this instinct to mock things because people get out of La and then they demand too much goddamn attention and they become a problem. And this is a, I think, I believe this goes back to hunting parties and hunter gatherers were the one person who just wanted too much attention. Like you, you're fucking it up for this group effort. And that's Kinda what happened socially when people claim these very ridiculous victim statuses, you know. And there was

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       a picture that I put up on my instagram a couple of weeks ago of this guy. He had this crazy makeup on and he had this ridiculous description of himself, like non binary queer that also identifies as a Muslim. And he was talking about quantum physics and quantum physics. Got helped him appreciate his queerness and I looked at that. I said, okay, maybe, or maybe you're just fucking crying out for attention, and all I wrote was a makes sense, definitely doesn't seem crazy and people got mad at me for that. For something so obvious. I looked. I just peered into the fucking deep dungeon. That is the comment section for a moment and I saw people like you would think that the people that are most susceptible to suicide, you would leave them alone, but you're cruelty is you know you're exposing your cruel to like, listen, that's silly. That guy needs better friends. Your friends are you going to tell you you're silly. You got crazy makeup. Have you seen Scott? You have a photo. Look at this British Iraqi gay, non binary and also identify as Muslim. Listen, you need too much goddamn attention. That's all I'm saying. I'm not saying you're a bad person. You should kill yourself. You shouldn't be queer. Be whatever you want to be, but if you're going that hard, that hard to define yourself like that is needy as shit. That's fucking annoying. Your

Speaker 2:          00:22:05       point, your point is that you have to titrate the negative feedback, right, so what you did was you gave them a small dose and say, look, you might want to course correct a little bit, but the idea that there's any course correction that you're not sitting there celebrating this. Right. Well, that's. That's the thing. Yeah. Yeah. You're supposed to celebrate it. I'm supposed to celebrate so many things. Yeah. Well, you know what? You can celebrate it. That's okay, but you shouldn't get mad if I go, oh, that might be a little nuts because it's obvious little nuts. It's a little nuts to paint your face with glitter. It's a little nuts. It's a little nuts. If that was just a regular person who's like, hi, I work at JC Penney. My name is Wendy and this is what I like to wear on my face. Like, okay, Wendy's a crazy bitch.

Speaker 2:          00:22:50       Look at Wendy. Go look at Wendy. Look at her face. What is she doing? I don't know, man. She got fucking crazy glitter and our hairs. 15 different colors a little bit. Okay. Let's look at it this way. I have this weird thing which sometimes is called Makilah phobia, the fear of cosmetics. Really? Oh Man. Lips. What? Con? Like smoking, smoking. No. Fake eyelashes. Well, is the thing is, is that sometimes they look somewhat normal and then suddenly it doesn't integrate and the person just looks like they've got crazy stuff stuck to their head. Like you've got crazy stuff's stuck to you. Well, that's how I perceive it. Now here's the question. I can't be in touch like they can't be. Eric's got a problem with Makilah phobia. Never heard that word. It's freaking me out. It has to be a phobia that it has to be.

Speaker 2:          00:23:40       Eric can't accept people who wear makeup. And my question would be from first principles, how do you tell who to have sympathy with? Because this has been somewhat debilitating for me. Really? Yeah, sure. So it's been a real issue, like you've struggled with. It struck. We have. You struggled with the feeling or struggle with the fact that you have that everybody actually experienced, if you remember Tammy, Faye Bakker, right? So she was famous for freaking people out because she had no concept of how much a hangup is too much, is too much. Now what if somebody looks normal and then you turn around and suddenly there, Tammy Faye Bakker and you never can predict when that's going to happen. So that's an interesting question about do we accept the person who. I don't know why I have this, it's just that some thing in my mind. Well, because you're a logical person and you're looking at this war paint that people are putting on and you don't understand the desire to do this, but I do understand you do, but you don't understand actually doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:24:39       I don't understand why it looks normal. Like I have the feeling that other people, it looks very different than the way it looks to me. Right? Well, they've just accepted it. Maybe sometimes I accepted and then suddenly, you know, I shake it. It's like you're shaking out of the movie, like you see a movie where the suddenly the Mike is visible from the top, uh, what's going on here? It's a movie, it's a movie and and that, but anyway, we all have these weird quirks. The question is with whom should we be sympathetic and with whom do we do? We say, well, you're being judgmental with me. It's a women's shoes that have gigantic heals. Those stilettos that they could barely walk in. That one freaks me out. It freaks me out because I see women walking in. I'm like, this is so crazy that this is a choice that you are.

Speaker 2:          00:25:31       I mean, I can't imagine I'm paranoid. I guess maybe I've seen too much physical conflict. I can't imagine wearing something that would physically compromised me to the point where I literally can't run away because you can't run away and those things, and if you're in like stilettos, like these little things that you walk around in and your feet are all smushed in your. You're basically doing tiptoes everywhere you go and you fuck. You have to be killing you by the end of the night. Right? Right. You're not running away. This is a wolf chasing you or some shit. If there's something going down, you're not. You're not getting away. It's just, it's a weird, like the desire to lengthen your legs and to give this graceful appearance called Lordosis behavior. Large doses or doses learning so much today. So high heels were originally developed for men to appear taller.

Speaker 2:          00:26:18       I'm not sure if it was too pure, taller only, or if it was for writing. I can't remember. Maybe for a lot of people don't know. Cowboy boots. The reason why they slip on like that is when the horse box and takes off your boots fall off. They're supposed to. I didn't know that. Yeah, that's the whole idea behind the reason you slip on and slip off and they have that heel is that wouldn't heal that he'll slips into the stirrups. So when you get when the Horse Bucks, you don't want to get dragged on. You wanted that shit that just fly off and then you're on your back going, Oh look at that horse go and then you go pick up your boots because they've fallen off. The fucking horse is gone, but at least you're alive. Oh, that's the expression. He died with his boots if you. Yeah, if you get. Well, not really, I think that's like a gunfight type deal, but I think if you get dry, I mean if you get dragged, horses are gonna, run over rocks and shit, you're done. People die all the time that are wearing regular shoes that shoved their feet in the stirrups and then you're stuck. That's why cowboy boots come off like that.

Speaker 1:          00:27:17       Yeah. I remember when I used to ride horses, we'd have the guy leading the trail would like take us up to a gallop and suddenly say emergency dismount. It was really terrifying. Yeah. And you know, you'd have to do it at speed very, very quickly. But I think that high heels got taken over by women because a lot of the things that we claim that we like about heels, that is the, uh, I do it for height, uh, like the way it makes the leg look at probably secondary to the curvature of the back and the way in which that is typically a associate associated with sexual receptivity. So it's that particular posture that the heel keynotes. And so the way I read it is that the cost of the heel is part of the communication. In other words, I'm willing to do something that is clearly not comfortable or for my benefit in any other way. So much so that you can tell that I must be interested in sending a signal 100 percent. Yeah. So, so the. Well, but you have to deny the signal to. So part of the signaling is to say, Oh, these are actually my most comfortable shoes. They always say that girls are hilarious. They're so comfortable. These are so comfortable. Right? Like how is that even possible? Those aren't crocs. Yes. But, but, but the deception has to be part of. Now I'm like, picturing

Speaker 2:          00:28:39       that was really weird. Well, the deception has to be. You have to, you have to decide that you're not ridiculous. Shared deception. Yes. Because as the guy, I have to say, oh, that's so interesting. Yeah. But that's a lie. Well, we're all lying, but it's mutually understood is a lie. Yeah. But when the girls are, girls could say these are so comfortable because they're not killing them because they've accepted a higher level of pain tolerance with footwear than men have. Like if I had a just jam my feet into something pointy. Like some point. Yes, Spanish dancer type shoes. It would hurt after awhile you ever wear a tie? I hate those things. So that's some kind of uncomfortable thing that we do to ourselves as men. Well, I used to have to wear one when I drove limos. I think. Well I've definitely worn one since then, but very rarely, very rarely can kill you pretty easily with a tie.

Speaker 2:          00:29:36       Like if someone has a tie on and I grab a hold their Thai boy, unless you're a lot bigger than me, I might kill you. Got a hold of your tie ties. A hard thing to shake loose. It's really strong like you could you. A good tie is not going to rip. Someone gets a hold of your tie at the not just twists and holds onto you. All they have to do is hold onto you, grab an arm, and just grab, wrap their legs around you and hold onto that ty. You're a dead man. Your debt. You're. You're giving them a weapon. Heal you all the time. All right, you've convinced me no more ties. I just grabbed that and just look and twist. You don't have much time, men, you, you don't have much time to get this arm off. Your such a UFC.

Speaker 2:          00:30:17       Have to figure out. It's a Jujitsu spin. [inaudible], UFC. You don't wear clothes, but to be able to grab a hold of someone's clothing like like a person with a leather jacket. If you're talking shit and you have a leather jacket on, you're with a guy who knows judo. You are beyond fucked. You don't do this. This guy might as well have cannons coming out of his body like you're. You're doomed. You're 100 percent doom. He's going to grab that leather jacket and basically this handles and he's gonna throw you up in the air and he's going to hit you with the world. The whole world is below it. He's going to drive you into the world and you're so fucked and you don't even realize it. Joe, how often do you end up in fistfights? Never. Never, man. I don't know. I don't want to have nothing to do with that.

Speaker 2:          00:31:02       I just get away. I would never want to get into fistfights. This is fascinating to me about this sort of the world here. It's always talking about fighting and what can happen, but just in in our world, there's like almost none of this in, you know, relatively boring white guy, middle age. You ever go on Worldstar hip hop, that Shit's all day everyday. There's plenty of videos you most, most of the time nothing happens, but the one time when Shit does happen, if you don't know how to defend yourself, you're really fucked. This is. This is true, but then the thing is, is that in all the practicing that you do, you're also exposing yourself to the potential for injury. Oh yeah. So there's a question as to whether you're safer. If you spend all of your time in this kind of, well, what if something happens?

Speaker 2:          00:31:52       I want to be prepared, but the preparation for it is itself potentially fairly hazardous. That's unquestionable, but isn't that just like the guy who sits on the couch and never goes into the woods because he doesn't want to get tired. I know it's very similar because like here we are, I'm 51 years old and um, and it all works. So even though I've been injured, I'm right here. Everything works like a. But you also got of this shit fixed. What if the UFC thing was like bold and interesting when you were a young guy, do you think you would have. I would have 100 percent done it and I probably would have a much harder time having this conversation. That's right. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. So I think you hit the sweet spot where you got the skills you've been in training idiom, you really know what you're talking about and you're getting front row seats but not actually having to have your brain particularly take the pounding.

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       There's no getting away from that. And that is the unfortunate reality that every fighter accepts. There's no getting away from that. There's, there's an absolute possibility, and it's not just your head, it's also your joints. A big part is your back and your neck. I know many guys that have neck impingements and disc herniations and fused neck disks and then nerve pinched nerves or impinged to the point where they have atrophy in their arms. I know several guys who have that where they have one arm that's smaller than the other arm and it severely impedes their ability to move and they used to be world champions to guys that have been on the show bus route and Pat Miletich two of the greatest of all time. Both guys have one small arm in one regular size arm because of neck impingements who their nerves are literally pinched down by all the swelling and scar tissue and that damaged discs.

Speaker 3:          00:33:34       Yeah. Well since we became friends, I started just casually looking at this world and it's utterly fascinating. I mean there's. There's nothing like it. Well, did you Jitsu world? I think you would. There's two different worlds, right? There's the MMA world which incorporates all the different martial arts, and then there's the Jujitsu world and the Jujitsu world. I think you would find seek out. Yes, you would love it because it's basically to call it chest is not quite fair because it's more complex than chess. There's much more going on. Visa freedom are so high, but it's also easier to win if someone's better than chess because even if someone is fairly competent in chess, we'll take a few moves to beat them. In Jujitsu, if someone's fairly competent in the other one is a master, it probably crush your very quickly, but the. When you watch two really high level guys trying to set each other up, it's this crazy rolling exercise and leverage and position and in the knowledge of moves that Eddie Bravo versus a crazy crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:34:36       Yeah. It's hard to even know what's going on. It's crazy. If you don't know, it's one of my more difficult challenges of being in a commentator is when the fight goes to the ground explaining to people watching at home. What he wants to do right now is get his right leg over his arm and as soon as he does that, now that arm is stuck. He's in trouble right now, you know, and like to try to explain that to people so they can follow along. Go, oh, I see, I see. And he's going to grab that. He's arch arches back any tapped? And people go, oh, and it gets people really excited about Jujitsu because they see that and you go, oh, this is like really complicated. Like he's got, there's like a dance he's doing. The other guy's trying to resist. But the first time I saw the gracie breakdown of particular fights where they've committed to memory every move.

Speaker 3:          00:35:17       Yeah. It's like replaying the great games of like morphy or Combo Banca chess and you're just thinking, wow, that, okay, there's the evergreen game, there's the moral game and that that to me is fascinating, but it's actually more interesting to me in the UFC arena because of the fact that that's only a component and that it's. What I didn't understand was how much we could get close to unrestricted fighting and still have people fairly dependably survive with minimal obvious disfigure disfigurements there is disagreement. Would there are some. We could even be safer if we eliminated weight cutting. The weight cutting is the number one health issue in the sport in my opinion. Yeah. Number two is the brain damage and the impact and the, you know, broken bones and things along those lines, but the number one is weight cutting because it's so unnecessary. It's such a, such an issue that needs to be addressed because these guys want to compete at the highest weight possible.

Speaker 3:          00:36:14       So do you know how it works? No. Okay. Say if you were going to compete in the 170 pound division, but you actually weighed one 90, which you would do is you would wait until you would follow a pretty strict diet, keep your body weight in your fat a certain level, and then when it comes down to a few days before you would dehydrate yourself pretty radically. Yeah. And then rehydrate yourself scientifically using the. There's a bunch of guys like George Lockhart guys who are experts in this and then they'll give you the exact right amount of nutrients right around of potassium and zinc and they want to replenish all of your electrolytes and get you in a perfect balance, but you're still compromised and if you don't have a guy like a George Lockhart or someone who's a real expert in nutrition and understands biology and can get you back into that position, you're most likely gonna compete compromised, but you're going to accept that significant compromising because you're going to be a bigger person than the person you're fighting, but they also, like in boxing in particular, the vast majority of deaths have occurred in the lighter weight divisions and a lot of it is not just because of the head trauma, but because it's head trauma to someone who's dehydrated.

Speaker 3:          00:37:16       That's interesting. Yeah. It's like it's. It's. It sucks and it's contrary to what martial arts is supposed to be about. Martial arts supposed to be about skill for skill. It's not supposed to be about cheating and that cheating thing is like you're dehydrating yourself. It's like sanctioned cheating. You're saying you're 170 pounds if you're like, if you say this, the 170 pound champion and get on the scale is one 93. What the fuck's going on? This isn't a 170 pounds. Now frustrating if I want to meet you in a different class like I wanted to fight you my whole life, but we're really separated. Well, you can lose weight the right way. Look, if somebody wants to compete at 170 pounds, in my humble opinion, they should actually weighed 170 pounds. My friend Cam Haynes is a ultra marathon runner and one of the things that he does when he gets ready for ultra marathons is he loses bodyweight, but he doesn't have any body weight to lose.

Speaker 3:          00:38:03       So he'll. He'll burn 300 calories and eat 2000 calories and that's how he loses weight. He lets his body eat itself so he gets down to the sixties and that's when he runs these gigantic long races, like 240 miles. But I know he's done this. You can do this like you don't have to dehydrate yourself, but they choose to dehydrate themselves because they replenish and then they get much bigger when they get inside the octagon. When he's 65, he's actually one 65. That's just what he weighs and that's the best way to run 240 miles, so he does it through discipline, but these guys that are it and it's not their fault because it's already been established. It's a part of the sport. It's been there for years and years and years and it's. It's sanctioned cheating and everybody does it and it's the worst part of the sport because it's really damaging to your kidneys, terrible for your organs.

Speaker 3:          00:38:50       Your body starts to shut down when you do it too often and your body doesn't want to lose weight anymore, so it starts to really hold onto that water and guys fall asleep and pass out and bang their heads off. Walls and fights get canceled like pro championship level flights get canceled because guys blackout and crack their head off the wall and this is. This has happened in the in the UFC before. It's just super, super unnecessary and unfortunate and part of it is because there's not enough weight classes. There's like, you know, there's 1:55, then there's one 70. The difference from 1:55 and one 70 is not just 15 pounds because if you actually weigh 1:55 and this guys dropping down to one 70, that motherfucker could be one 90 plus and he's just figuring out a way to cut weight to get down to there and that happens all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:39:38       So you're, you're dealing with, you know, it could be 25, 30 pounds difference between you two guys if you're, if you actually way with the weight classes when you get into the octagon, so people are forced to drop weight, they're forced to go lower. If they want to compete at a world class level, they're forced to take this extra risk and it could be mitigated. It could, it could all be stopped by hydration test. The UFC could step in. All the athletic commissions could step in and say, enough is enough. You're going to fight it, what your way and we're going to give you more weight classes so you could figure out what's the wait for you to be best at and I hope it doesn't take someone dying before they figured this out because it's one of those things that people have done like circumcision.

Speaker 3:          00:40:20       They've done it forever so they just keep doing it, but if they just started doing it tomorrow, people are like, why did you cut that baby's Dick? Are you fucking crazy? Well, I've always cut babies, ticks. I've been cutting babies. Dick's for years. Like this is right. It's like a yiddish get used to it. Well, it's not just yiddish mean I'm Catholic. My Dick are cut. It's like practiced across the board under the guise of being sanitary. It's prevention of AIDS. All these stupid reasons to cut dicks like it. Really, it's just a tradition that doesn't make any goddamn sense. Now. It's not the best analogy to weight cutting

Speaker 1:          00:40:54       the cutting dicks. I do want to pick up on an analogy which I'm curious about. So when you're trying to describe the ground game, yeah, it's super tough for a lay audience because the picture doesn't necessarily match what you're seeing because the layer of expertise makes a bunch of random arm movements and head movements and hip movements into something else. We have the same problem in like math and physics where everybody wants to know what's going on with that thing. And then when you have been listening to like the physicists on your program, I don't think you have many mathematicians, but it's so confusing to figure out how to talk to the world about things that people, everybody wants to know about. And I was just curious as if you saw a parallel, uh, in those two things. Those are certainly very high art forms.

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       Yeah. I'm. Sean Carroll has done a really good job of trying to explain things. Neil degrasse Tyson's done a really good job trying to explain things. I saw, um, the explanation of gauge symmetry Lawrence Krauss on your show, which is like from two to my way of thinking when the most important principles in the world. I still have no idea what the fuck he said exactly. Well like, well I read his book. Yeah. And after I read his book, that was the number one question I had. I said, okay, I need you to explain to me what is gates symmetry? What does that mean? It's so weird that he didn't. I don't think he expected you to just bust it out. Yeah, I don't think so either. That's it, but I think that it's so hard to like, okay, here's one of my. I will get back together.

Speaker 1:          00:42:28       Symmetry maybe. But like when people say the universe is expanding, right? What the fuck does that mean? Every, every smart person says into what? Right. You know, like it's the universe. What is it expanding into? Right. And where's it going? Right. And it, it doesn't make any sense because the linguistics of the universe is expanding, isn't really what the what. So you're saying the matter in the universe is moving outwards, is that what the universe is expanding? What it means is I'm, the infinite universe is getting more infant her. No. So first of all was that they. Did you say that? Yeah, I was trying to be silly to sativa is kicking in. Yeah. Um, so if you think about this bottle, right, it's the slices of the bottle that are expanding, but if you think of the bottle is the universe the bought the bottle isn't expanding.

Speaker 1:          00:43:25       It's just the cross sections that are expanding. And so that's what they really mean. What they really mean is something like the spacetime metric on space, like cross sections has a, it's volume for them when integrated is higher or something like that. Some, some mathematical statement, but the universe is expanding is not helpful to me. Like if I wasn't able to read the math, I would say I don't get it. Well, I don't get anything quite honestly. I'm not being self deprecating. I don't get the Big Bang. Yeah. I don't get it at all. Well, okay. Here's what somebody should tell you. Okay. Um, there are two kinds of singularity's when you try to solve Einstein's field equations for gravity. So gravity as a thing, Einstein tells us pretty much, uh, what we think gravity is the curvature of space and time. And when we try to solve his equations, we get these black hole singularities which called swartz chilled singularities, and let me get this initial singularity a which we associate back to the big bang with the freedmen Walker Robertson model in some.

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       Those singularities are indications to us that we're not at the end of physics and that Einstein's equations aren't, there aren't the real story. And so rather than sort of saying they're a pretty good model up until this point and then we kind of really don't know what happened, then we have the observational thing that we would map to the big bang and then we have the model thing that we would map to the big bang. And to be honest with you, I'm pretty sure that are our models don't make sense past a point. And now we're having this conversation past the point where we're pretty sure they don't make sense. That would be much more honest to me, but because we have this desire to, um, to blow people's minds gratuitously, um, and everybody wants to. How did everything begin and where are we? Who are we in? We want to sort of answer more of that than we probably should.

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       Hmm. That's an interesting way. That makes sense. Let me give you an alternate spin on quantum mechanics. Okay. So typically people will say, you know, the mind blowing thing about quantum mechanics is that it's probabilistic and that is kind of mind blowing, but if you actually say it differently, you say, look in classical mechanics like newton stuff that we feel more comfortable with, you have good questions and bad questions. Like if you and I go hang out at the beach and I say to you, hey, where's that wave concentrated? At what point does that with wave live? You look at me and say it's a wave. It's not concentrated at a point. It's all along the shore. So as a classical physicists you to say that's not a good question, Eric, and when I asked you a good question, like how fast is that wave front, moving along this trajectory of something, you can give me an answer and it's definite.

Speaker 1:          00:46:20       So as long as you ask a good question. In classical mechanics, you get definite answers when you go to quantum mechanics and you ask a good question. Uh, technically that means that the state vector is an observable of the, her mission operator representing the question. Nevermind. I'm funny. Thing happens. You get deterministic answers. There's no probability involved whatsoever. So if I ask a good question in quantum mechanics, I have the same property that I, I, I do. When I ask a good question in classical mechanics, I get a definite answer. There is no probability when I ask a bad question and quantum mechanics instead of like classical mechanics says, you know, screw off, I'm not answering that. That's ridiculous. It's a bad question. Quantum mechanics, as you really want to ask me a bad question. All right, I'll give you maybe this answer and maybe that answer and here's the probability distribution that I'll actually give you either of those two answers and what's more, I'll even kick it into the state that I, that you asked about.

Speaker 1:          00:47:18       So for example, if you ask where is that wave concentrated? So like let's say this is my coffee cup and I drop a little drop in the center of it, that creates a circular way that radiates. And I say, where does the wave concentrated? Well, at one second it hits the Coffee Mug. Let's say it's a big coffee cup and at one second after that it's concentrated again in the center. So that becomes a good question only when the wave becomes really concentrated in the center of the cup. Right? But if that wave where a quantum wave, I could ask where is the way of concentrated and with equal probability, suddenly the wave will concentrate at some point along the circle that represents the wave,

Speaker 1:          00:48:01       right? So what would your answer be then? What the point would be a. it'll concentrate at one of these points around the circle at random, with equal, with equal probability, and suddenly the wave will concentrate randomly. When I, when it's a quantum question. So this is why quantum mechanics is so confusing. Quantum physics are so confusing to people because they hear, they hear that and they go, okay, this is confused when in my head like Jello. Well, that's the thing, but the point of if I, if I have a wave and I slow it down, I can look at a wave and a coffee mug and I can see that if I ask where is the wave concentrated, you would say it's concentrated at like half an inch from the center of the cup and say, no, no, not what ring is it concentrated or what exact point that concentrated in exact point, but that wave in quantum mechanics which is not concentrated at an exact point behaves differently. When I ask a bad question. So the, the point that I'm trying to get across is good questions have exactly the same properties in classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. There's no introduction to probability theory. The weird question is why is quantum mechanics answering bad questions?

Speaker 1:          00:49:08       Well, or maybe even weirder question is

Speaker 1:          00:49:14       not just why is quantum mechanics in an adolescent state of understanding? I mean, it was part of the problem that they don't know enough yet and they're trying to like explain what they do know and what they can prove on paper and for a person like me, like, well, what do you know? And they're like, well, we know probabilities. We know this, we know that and a person like me who doesn't have any studying and it just goes up. What does that mean? Well that's, that's great. So like let's say we were having a conversation about genetics and we were looking only at the DNA and we didn't see epigenetics in terms of like methylation patterns. Then you'd, you'd shove everything onto DNA and maybe you had no concept of like development and the model would work up to a point would explain why you have blue eyes or Brown eyes, but it wouldn't explain all sorts of other things.

Speaker 1:          00:50:01       And so now then you over overdeveloped that model. So I think that what you're saying is really Einstein's intuition, which is. I'm not saying I'm Einstein, I'm not saying that this is wrong. I'm saying this is incomplete. And then when we finally get the answer, we're going to say, oh, that's why we used to think of it in those crazy terms. So back to gauge theory, gauge symmetry. What the hell was that? All right, well, here's the. Here's the craziest thing. Okay. There is a very confusing visual image of the fundamental unit that you need to appreciate what gauge symmetry is all about. And uh, I had Jamie loaded up under the tab called planet hop and this is going to hop pf a h, o, p, f, what the fuck am I looking at you? Or looking at the most important object in the universe, what that looks like, some trippy screensaver on your laptop.

Speaker 1:          00:50:59       Take another puff, my friend because it's worth it. This is what you're looking at is a principle fiber bundle and it's in, it is the earth. Those are the continents. That's the cool part about it, which is this is very confusing to figure out what you're looking at, but it's finite. In other words, if we stay for an hour or two on this and we actually answer all your questions, you will actually know what a principal and bundle is and you will know the arena in which gauge theory exists for folks at home that are just listening and they were. What the fuck are these guys talking about? What is the name of this video? Jamie video. Not a video. It's a small file on a page I typed in planet hop and that was the first thing that showed up on math dot Toronto Dot Edu.

Speaker 1:          00:51:46       Okay, so extended thing. Planet h o p, F for anybody wants to look at this. If you're just listening and you have no idea why I'm freaking out. So this, this was done by a friend of mine named Drawer Barn Aton. I actually coded the same thing up. Um, strangely enough. Didn't do a brilliant job of coloring it. It looks amazing. Motorola. So okay. What's you're looking at is a two dimensional sphere that is the surface of the earth where an extra circle is included at every point on the surface of that sphere, which you're now visualizing, and that extra circle, which would be called the fiber, um, when you take the totality of all of those circles together, one for each point on the surface of the sphere, they create something called a three sphere that is all the points that are one unit of distance away from the origin in four dimensional space.

Speaker 1:          00:52:52       So that three dimensional sphere is the analog of a two dimensional spheres sitting in three dimensional space. So think about a caramel apple. If you've ever made caramel apples, you get a disk of Carmel and you wrap it around the sphere. That is the apical surface, right? So this is the three dimensional version of Carmel wrapped around the three dimensional, a sphere sitting in four dimensional space. Now, do you understand any of this, Jamie? I'm trying, dude. It's totally trippy, right? And so we're not going to get it completely during this session. However, I think I lacked the tools. I don't think so if that we lack the time. So the first thing is you are finding out that one of your friends thinks this is the most important object in the universe and you've never even heard of it. Much less know that there's one visual example.

Speaker 1:          00:53:47       What's a fuck? How is this happening? I know exactly. It does look fucking crazy. Well, okay. This is what was discovered in the mid 19 seventies as the connection between mathematics and different, what we call differential geometry and the discipline of particle theory. So two guys, uh, Jim Simons, the world now, the world's most successful hedge fund manager and cn Yang, a person who might arguably be the world's first or second greatest living, theoretical physicists had a lunch seminar. And they said, why don't we figure out how do we talk to each other? And what they found out is they both had developed a version of this picture and independently, independently. So it was the Rosetta stone that unleashed a revolution. So when Lawrence Krauss was talking to you about gauge theory, he was saying things about chessboards and you color it white and you color it black.

Speaker 1:          00:54:47       Super confusing to me. I would rather your people be confused about an actual example of the object on which we do gauge theory that you can visually see [inaudible] right now, if I started to tell you what gauge theory is pretty simple. So here's the. Here's the description. I never hear anyone say when you're doing differential calculus. I don't know if you remember differential calculus. Trying to figure out the slopes of lines. Instantaneous rise over the run. So that always makes sense to people. Okay. I figured out how fast it's going up versus how fast it's going across. But a question arises which is where do you measure the rise from? So for example, if I say, what is the height of Mount Everest, Jamie? We'll say 30, 30, 5,000, something like that. Something crazy like that. Well, let's get an internet connection, I guess. What do you think it is?

Speaker 1:          00:55:49       I don't know. I can't remember if I was to say it's $35,000. What do you think that it was? Twenty nine. Twenty nine. Oh, two nine. Okay. What's, uh, the highest was the highest one. Is it k two? K Two is second, right? Is it has ever the highest? Yeah, but okay, so everest, 29. Would you say 29. Twenty nine. Oh, two nine. Nine. Above what sea level. Whereas Mount Everest located the Himalayas. What does that, what? See? Uh, there's no ocean there, right? So like we snuck its above sea level and there's no ocean. So we start from the center of the Earth. Will we have this structure called the joy, which is the interpolation of sea level as if sea level is. If the earth was only ocean and there was no tie in as if there's some sort of a. So we snuck in the reference level.

Speaker 1:          00:56:39       That's my point is, is that we teach these kids to repeat why it's 29,000 and change above sea level and there's no C. Right? So that reference level is the magic of gauge theory, right? Which is that we measured the rise over the run based on a custom level, so at a level that we all agree upon. So for example, let's imagine that you and I are in some country experiencing hyperinflation, right? And I'm your boss and you say, dude, I need a raise. I said, well look, I've told you I would hire you for, you know, 10,000 dinars a month. And you say, yeah. I said, well, your salary is constant. I took the derivative of it. I've paid you $10,000 last month, 10,000 this month. So you're getting the same amount derivative, equal zero. It's constant salary. Now you have to come back at me in calculus and you say, no, I don't like your notion of the derivative because what you're doing is you're measuring the absolute number of dinars that you're paying me, but what I want to do is I want to measure it and purchasing power because I'm losing money every month that you don't increase my salary.

Speaker 1:          00:57:48       So I now come up with a version of the calculus in which Mike salary is not constant because it's being measured relative to purchasing power rather than absolute units. That's gauge there is that you're bringing in a reference level that does the differentiation. So you're measuring rise over run by customizing the problem. So these were two different applications of the calculus that cheating employer says, I want to go with constant dnrs. The gifted employees says not so fast. I know gauge theory. I want to use a custom reference level which is purchasing power, right? So it's like sneaking the geoint into Tibet to measure everest. I've got my custom level. It was. This makes sense to you. Yes, it makes sense right now. Explain it. Say what he said.

Speaker 1:          00:58:41       We would need a new reference of what we're. You want to measure what the new conversation to have like a flat level. I guess it would be really difficult for me to recall a day from now maybe we'd know we'd might have recalled that might pop up mushroom cap. See what's up. It's. I'm still in reference to quantum physics. Like how you would use gauge symmetry? Well, but let's do it. Let's look at some more cool stuff with the visual cortex because everything that we can do visually should inform what we can do linguistically. So you should push everything into the visual realm that you can. Uh, do you mean by that? Like, well I just showed you the hop vibration, which is the only, in some sense the only mature picture I can show you have a principal vibration in geometry or physics that is honest and has the full complexity. It's got a certain kind of nodded newness to it. It's got something that we would call curvature and it is visualized and so

Speaker 1:          00:59:47       it would be better that we spent, you know, a day or two on this most important object which we think reality is based around and that you visually got comfortable with it. And then you said, okay, now tell me again what gauge symmetry is. And then instead of Lawrence talking about this chessboard and the colors and all this stuff, by analogy, you'd actually be seeing gauge theory visually like I could program a computer and have done so to show you visually what a gauge theory is. And that takes some time to sort of understand what the trip he pictures are. But if let's bring up the escher staircase

Speaker 1:          01:00:24       and Jamie has a nice wrinkle on this, that instead of using MC escher staircase, he's got this animated guy who just keeps going down. All right, now what's going on with those stairs? Now the stairs are sort of an optical illusion because obviously it can't just keep going down. But then you build these systems like rock, paper, scissors. What's the best thing to throw in rock? Paper scissors? Well, it depends on what you throw. Well, but we should be able to agree that rock is better than scissors. Rock has better than says this paper's better than rock, right? So you go around that thing and now the point is that you get to like rock as much better than rock. Right? And that seems crazy. Now that can concept would be what we would call Holland Omi. The weird sentence. Rock is better than rock because of that going around the loop.

Speaker 1:          01:01:09       Why rock has better than rock? I don't get it well better than scissors. Scissors is better than paper. Paper's better than rock. So by transitivity rock is therefore better than rock because you went around the loop and came back to rock. It's like Mna. Math. Yeah. Yeah. Or if like if you're. If you're changing a currencies and you don't spend any of it because you keep losing using your credit card, by the time you come home you had more money than when you left because the exchange rates did some things so that when you changed into each currency, you somehow got richer. But by saying rock is better than rock, you're denying the fact they're exactly the same. Well, no, not. You're not addressing the linguistic linguistic fallacy. Right? So the idea that this system here, so those stairs in engaged theory would be these reference levels for the derivative [inaudible]. And you can have situations where the reference levels don't knit flatly together. Right? And so by virtue of that, we would say that the system has curvature, curvature. Is the assuredness of, of these better than transitive statements what we're looking.

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       Yeah, folks, for people who just listening, we're looking at, if you've never seen those essure etches, those sketches, they're very strange because what there are is a bunch of staircases that appear to always be going downhill, even if one of them is above the other one. It's a very strange, very strange. And this one we're watching an animated guy rolled down this staircase constantly, even though it really looks like somehow or another, it must go up somewhere, but you don't ever see it going up. But it's also a factor of the illusion of perspective and how it's drawn and, and playing games with lines.

Speaker 1:          01:02:54       Exactly. But if you do this very weird experiment, which we didn't know about until the late fifties called the aronoff Boehm experiment. If you run, um, a, a, an electric current through a wire that's insulated, um, it's, it appears not to have any electromagnetic field outside of the installation. However, if you do some sort of quantum interference experiment, you can tell that there's current going through because it affects the phage phase shift, let's say, of an electron orbiting that insulated electromagnetic system. So nobody thought that that was going to happen because they thought, well, it insulator would keep. We thought the electromagnetic field is what determines the shift in the electronic, but it's insulated so there is no electromagnetic field to worry about. It turned out that it wasn't the electromagnetic field alone, it was some previous geometric concept which is called the electromagnetic potential that determine something about the phase shift.

Speaker 1:          01:03:58       So this escher staircase in the case of electromagnetism, it's like the photons are the analog of those steps. They're partially would determine the derivative operators, does reference levels and again, in our discussion of the, uh, am I paying you the right amount and a hyper inflationary economy. So all of these things you're trying to figure out, well that's an optical illusion, but that effect actually occurs in some systems, not as an optical illusion. Yes. Right. So this weirdness, I'm requires a fair amount in terms of either study of math or learning visualizations, but there's no way to achieve it in my experience with linguistic communications. Like all the stuff that gets said about, you know, the universe is expanding or let me tell you what it gauge theory is and why there's a reason it's confusing. It's because it doesn't make any sense. I see what you're saying.

Speaker 1:          01:04:57       Sort of. But. So this is, this is like what fineman said. If you think you know, quantum physics, you don't know quantum physics. Well there's some of that like there's, you know, one of the most important things in the world is this thing called a spinner, like the electrons and the protons correspond to things called spinners. And the average person has no idea that spinners exist. What's more? Spinners have a property that when I tell it to you linguistically won't make any sense. Alright, good. Let's do this with coffee. Hit me with it. Okay. So yeah, thank you sir. Perfect. All right, here's the problem. Okay. Hold Your Cup. No sorry. From the bottom. And here's the first challenge without spilling it. Okay? I want you. And without readjusting your grip on the bottom of your cup, I want you to turn your cup 360 degrees. No, no. Sorry. Turn your fingers. Should not change on the cup. Turn the cup 360 degrees without spilling it and try to take a sip. Okay. That didn't work. Now without coming back, how would you take a sip if I got it all the way around that way? Yeah. Mr. Jujitsu man would have to.

Speaker 4:          01:06:18       Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:06:20       I would have to help myself. No, no, you're going to do it. Alright, you ready? Okay. Here we go. You're going to go around the circle. Three hundred and 60. Okay. Right now I'm screwed if I don't bring it back underneath. Oh, I see. So that system required 720 degrees of rotation unexpectedly. You just keep going. Right. Okay. Now the idea that there are objects that don't come back to themselves under 360 degrees of rotation but require seven slash 20 is probably something you've never thought about before in your life. Right? But without that, you wouldn't have the poly exclusion principle, you wouldn't have the stability of matter. And this thing is called the Philippine wind dance. Jamie, do you want to. That's not very seductive, Jeff. It seems like some very odd ethnic dance. Yeah. But like maybe you could do 11th planet Jujitsu. Here we go. So this spinner is one of the coolest, most important objects anywhere. And it was discovered to be important in physics by a guy named Paul Dirac. Right? It's fun. Okay. So this 720 theory

Speaker 1:          01:07:38       is entirely responsible for the world that we live in. This is so bizarre to don't know, but in animation and nobody knows about it, right? Like unless you're hanging out with physicists, they don't tell you that electromagnetism has to do with the fact that there's a secret circle at every point in space and time that's invisible to you. They don't tell you that there's stuff that requires 720 degrees of rotation. They just say mindblowing stuff about, whoa. So what is happening in his 720 degrees of rotation in the quantum world? There is an object that is requiring this just the way the cup arm system requires 720 degrees of is this called a spinner and that spinner is how we model the electron, Neutrino corks, all that is spin oriel matter,

Speaker 1:          01:08:32       sir. That's good. Long pause and like it. And what, where does this fit in, in our model of the universe? Like what is the function of this? Why is it there? What is it, how do we know it's there? Well, we know it's there because uh, when dereck. So there was this problem with like the Schrodinger equation. Schrodinger equation takes one derivative in terms of the direction of time it takes to derivatives in the direction of all the spacial directions. But because Einstein told us that space and time are woven together for the theory to be relativistic, you need the same number of derivatives of time as of space because space time is sort of one kind of semi unified object. All right? That means you either have to boost the number of derivatives of time up to two to match the two derivatives and the directions of space where you have to knock the two direct derivatives in the spatial directions, down to one derivative to get it to be equal.

Speaker 1:          01:09:31       Now one direction gets you to something called the client coordinate equation. What Dirac did is he took a square root of the client Gordon equation to get these spinners. So he had these numbers he didn't understand at first that he was going to get kicked into this world of spinners. He came up with a square root equation in which eight times be thought to be numbers was not equal to b times. That was equal to the negative of b times a. So it was like, what two numbers when you multiply them matter in which order. There wasn't numbers, it was matrices. So this was one of the great insights, you know, rival Tine Stein in terms of the depth of what it told us about the universe. Most of us haven't really heard of Paul to rock. We don't realize that he has. One of the three most important equations in physics now in when you say three most important, important in how it's applicable to everyday life or important and how it's given us an understanding and quantum physics or important. How it's understand it's, it's understanding is is significant. Quantum physics, we're talking about bedrock reality like you and I are having a conversation and if you're a matrix fan and what we might call the construct. Okay. What is the construct made have made? So the way I do it is I think of it as a newspaper story. There's where and when did it happen? There was who and what was involved and there's how and why. Okay, so we're in, when is space and time clearly

Speaker 1:          01:10:57       the WHO and the what? To me, let's say the who is the spinoff aerial stuff. It's like electrons, protons, neutrons, corks, the stuff that we're made of and then you and I are only able to see each other because we're passing photons back and forth which are forced particles. They're not spinning royal. They, they come back to themselves after 360 degrees. They don't require 7:20. So this is sort of the, you know, if you were going to go to a play, you'd have the, the dramatic personnel of the play given to you at the beginning. So this is what this universe is, it's a story about space and time in wherein, when about what is in that, you know, like who are the players and what equipment are they using that's like Bozo firmagon's and then there's the how and the why, which is the equations and the Lagrand genes that govern the rules of play.

Speaker 1:          01:11:50       You know. So for example, if you and I, you know, start to go to the beach and uh, we've got a ball and a net and you think we're going to play volleyball. And we actually sent me, says, no, we're going to play Seapak tuck grow, which is like volleyball played with the feet in a martial art style, which is awesome. Yeah, we showed a video on that recently. Sleeves from Thailand or Bali there. They're really good at amazing. It's amazing. It's like ballet, martial arts, soccer and volleyball happening. One thing we should, we should do this as a nation. That's a different set of rules for a ball and a net in two teams that you could have done it. One way is volleyball and you could have done it another way, a Seapak Tucker, were you using your feet, not your hands. So those.

Speaker 1:          01:12:34       That's sort of the breakdown of what a physics theory is. You got to tell me where and when you got to tell me what's in the game and you gotta tell me what the rules are and that's what this place is. So theoretical physics is the most interesting of all of these fields to me, not because it speaks to us about our daily lives because it speaks to us about, well where are we? Where is, where is this thing taking place? So it seems to me that there's a small number of people like that are studying this stuff that are. They're getting passed biology, they're getting past gravity, climate change, all these different variables that we're constantly dealing with and they're, they're getting to the very things that make everything and what is it under the wiring lift, lift up the board, what's going on in here?

Speaker 1:          01:13:31       Right? It's like getting into a computer down to the zero and one logic gates, right? Yeah. So that thing. We've got three or four equations. We've got three or four different kinds of objects in the system. We seem to be and people are going to not like what I'm about to say, but screw them. We seem to be almost at the end, like these equations are so beautiful. They're so tight that it's almost most mysterious because it feels like this thing like a movie that ended prematurely. How so? Well, when we found the Higgs particle at the LHC, there wasn't anything left that needed to close to explain the system. We know that there's dark matter out there that we don't understand. We know that there's dark energy out there that we don't understand because of astronomical observations, but all the stuff that we know about when you look at it and collided at high energies and figure out what mutates into what.

Speaker 1:          01:14:34       There's nothing missing anymore. So it's like. It's like you have got this odd thing where everything got very, very simple, very unified, and it felt like we were going to get one or two more giant unification and the whole thing would be tied up with a bow and right now we just don't have anything that is needed to close the system. So for example, when you have radioactive carbon decay, um, what you see is that one of the neutrons flips into being a proton and it spits out an electronic when it does that, right? So it's like, it's like a trans nucleonics. It shifts what it is. Okay. That electron doesn't carry off enough energy to explain how energy would be conserved. There was something missing. So this guy, Wolfgang Pauli said, I bet there's a particle that's neutral so we can't see it. We won't leave a track in a cloud chamber.

Speaker 1:          01:15:31       It won't have any effect that we can see electromagnetically, but it's carrying away some of the energy because I'm not going to give up on conservation of energy just because this particular process doesn't seem to conserve it. And sure enough, there was the sneaky particle that was spiriting away, some of the energy of the system that couldn't be seen because it didn't interact electromagnetically and it didn't interact according to the strong force. The only thing you could use to trap it would be the weak force. The weak force was so weak. That was very hard to see it. Okay, well, there's no new tree that I know have left to find. There's no thing that's missing in our standard model and I'm just not satisfied. Nobody's satisfied that the play is over. Why would the play be over? Just because we've discovered all the neutrinos?

Speaker 1:          01:16:19       Well, no, it's that we had an easy job when there was stuff that was missing and then you just hypothesize. I bet there's some invisible thing that's carrying away some stuff. Let's go look for something that's hard to see. So they find it. And so they'd find the higgs. So they find the higgs, they find the neutrinos, they find torque glue on plasma. And a lot was going to go there. But I was going to say that they found like alternate generations of matter, so you and I are made out of the first generation of matter, but there could be alternate Joe Rogan made out of second generation or third generation. We don't know of any generations beyond these two. Hold up. Yeah. What are you talking about?

Speaker 1:          01:16:58       So like the electron has, it has a relative called them yuan that behaves exactly like the electronic, except it's heavier and the uptown, the up and quarks that make up protons and neutrons have relatives called strange quirks and charmed corks. So there's like a second copy of Lego that has all the same properties as the first copy of Lego, except it's at a different mass level, which is denser, but it's almost identical copy. And nobody wanted this thing. So the famous jokes there was this guy is a door robbie who was like a, you know, kind of an ethnic Jew in, in, in, uh, in New York. And when they found the second generation of matter, he responded as if it was a group of people at a deli. And he said, who ordered that? You know, and so that's, that's the joke. And physics who ordered that?

Speaker 1:          01:17:45       Nobody knew there was a second generation. And then like, then they hit us over the head, you know, there's a third one too. Everybody's just like, what? Why, where are these things coming from? So the fact that you don't know this, like what a profound disconnect that you're having all these physicists on the show. And these are the basic secrets that were, were, these are rock solid, these aren't, this isn't speculative multi-verse. String theory will move Schrodinger's cat stuff, you know, this is like, this is ground truth and we don't know it and we don't know it because nobody will show you a picture of the vibration. Or there's a concept called the group, which is how we think about symmetry that no mathematician or physicist can go a day without talking about groups almost. And we act as if it doesn't need to be taught in high school.

Speaker 1:          01:18:36       Like it's too. It'll blow your mind. We're not going to teach you. The groups even exists. So we built the professional version of the subject around objects that we don't even tell you exist when you're studying in school. So if you think about the portal story in childhood, there's the story about either it's a rabbit hole or a looking glass or a wardrobe or platform nine and a half or whatever these things are. I don't know what the Harry Potter version of it, but how do I get from the world that I'm in to this new amazing world and even find out that it's there. And that's what I think theoretical physics has failed to do. It hasn't built a portal for most people to even understand what the issues are. What are the objects? What is the game? How close are we to understanding what existence itself is, which I think we're very, very close.

Speaker 1:          01:19:30       And the square root. This was, I was going to say before about Derok is like the most profound object and mathematics to me. And the reason is is that when I ask you what is the square root of negative one, that is a question that can be posed entirely within the familiar. So the real, the real numbers, you're comfortable, you know, you owe money, you have money. So I need plus plus one and minus one square root and understand what w, what times itself equals my number. And when you say what's the square root of negative one, there's no answer inside of the real line, but there is inside of this extension called the complex numbers. And so it's like you're in flatland and you're trying to figure out is there anything beyond flatland. So the great thing about the square root is it's a question you can ask in flatland that gets you out of flatland

Speaker 1:          01:20:21       teases. You confuse the shit out of me. Are you with this? I understood that part of it. Yeah, because I understood that part. The complex numbers thing got weird when you. Okay. Algebra. So when I. So when I'm taking like rotations of the Coffee Cup where my arm isn't involved, right? I say okay, is there a square root of that rotation? Like what does that even mean? Dude? All right, well now I put my arm into the system and my arm plus Coffee Cup gives you spinners like, oh dude, I did not even know that spinners were here. I did not know that any object required 720 degrees of rotation.

Speaker 1:          01:20:56       So the cup arm system, we just exhibited it. You don't need to learn Clifford Algebra's or all of the extra jazz that would get you to spinners mathematically, but you need to figure out how do I discover the war, the hidden world. Think about this from the perspective of, of like Iowasca somebody takes Iowasca and they have no idea that their brain is capable of this alternate state or Lsd or five Meo dmt. All of these things are like panic rooms in the mind where if you lived in a house for 20 years, you think you know your house and then one day you pull an old musty book off the shelf and suddenly the bookshelf swings open, you know? And I was like, holy crap, there's like a second home inside of my home. Well, that's a lot of what psychedelics, psychedelics are like square roots. Um, in that their portals, they can get you from the place that you know into a place that you never imagined could exist.

Speaker 3:          01:21:54       Do you think that the teaching of groups and a lot of these concepts in highschool would facilitate a better understanding of it from the general public and adulthood and the Gal and it would. What do you think is the resistance to this? It's just too complex or not applicable to jobs, you know, is that the idea behind it is not something that you use in everyday life so that it's just too weird to think about the fact that there's cousins to the electron that are fat and

Speaker 1:          01:22:25       a much worse than this bodybuilder cousin to the. You want to bulk up and get made that have strange quirks. One of your cousins is made out of lead. No, I think it's much worse than this. I think that first of all, people are terrified of just how smart children are and the differences between children have to be buried. So some children are graded abstraction and a lot of the kids were great at abstraction or learning disabled according to the teaching system. Now, I personally think that most learning disabilities have a particular type are actually teaching disability. People don't know how to teach the smartest kids and groups and things. You're going to lose some people because of the level of abstraction, but you're going to get other people who have never been able to buy a base hit and mathematics suddenly start over performing. So the problem is that when you teach this stuff, it's very disruptive to notions of the hierarchy. Have you

Speaker 3:          01:23:25       thought about what are the causes of these different levels of perception? Is it education? Is it genetics, is it environmental? Is it some sort of a chemical balance of the mind? Like what? What do you think causes people to be more perceptive to some of these concepts?

Speaker 1:          01:23:44       It's a good question. So the thing I just showed you with the planet earth in a way that you've never seen it before. I know of only two people who've ever created that image. I'm one of them. Drawing Barden Aton is the other, maybe there are many more, but I've never heard of or met them. The number of people first of all know what the hop vibration is, I would guess is really deeply know it. It is a few thousand people in the world, so if none of those people are gifted at trying to visualize or none of them care, none of them program computers, the number of people who could present that to the world is so small. It's such a tiny priestly class that your odds of getting anyone figuring out how to make this understandable are very small. So we're talking about a very small priesthood, most of whom are too busy trying to do new research, to want to care, to communicate.

Speaker 1:          01:24:39       Many of whom are not gifted communicators. Many of us realize that we don't fully understand these things. I mean like I can. I can show you spinners mathematically on a page, but if you asked me in my darkest moments, do I believe that man really knows what spinners are? I don't think so. This, there's all this stuff that to me looks like the monolith in 2001, it's just too freaky, comes out of nowhere and it's at the core of reality. Like if you really want to blow your mind, look at a tiny number, tiny collection of these objects, a principal fibrations spinners, exceptionally groups this eight, 248 dimensional monster. This, uh, what is that? There's a 248 dimensional set of cemeteries, which seems to live only to be the symmetries of itself where everything else seems to live to symmetry, tries something else and Nope, this might have to spark that joint back up again.

Speaker 1:          01:25:39       Let's do that. You know, there's this thing called the tits Fred and fall magic square after this guy named Chuck teats. And um, these guys, uh, figured out how to generate these sets of symmetries of dimension. Fifty to 78, 133 and 248. We don't know why they're there. They're like plot of Pi and a kid knows of the mathematical world. They're just different. They don't seem to relate to anything else that we, that we know yet, and that's what's so fascinating about them and these are discovered by people that are trying to figure out the nature of reality. They're discovered by people trying to find more of these bizarre equation. Who's who's discovering these in what's the impetus? Like what? What is will you ask? Very natural questions like you've probably seen you ever played dungeons and dragons as a kid? Luckily. No. Okay. While you were beating people up, stop it.

Speaker 1:          01:26:44       I've seen one video anyway. You had these die, right? Yeah. Like the cube die. The tetrahedral die. What does this shaming pattern beyond space time? This is my eight d surface parents. My Arch Nemesis when I was telling the story last time. Sober October. Yeah, Garrett Lisi. Bobby took me out into the jungle to meet this sort of differential geometric warlord who lives in the north of Maui and the jungle farming. Yeah. Well you don't remember this. I do now. Yeah. You cut off my story, man. Santa. Yeah. I'm sorry. That's all right. Go for it. Here we are again. Put that back up. So whoa, what is that? Well, this is, this is based on the eight dimensional. I'm almost certain it's gonna be based on the eight dimensional root system. So inside of the 248 dimensions, there's an eight dimensional donut called a tourists, like an eight tourists, and it generates this pattern and that pattern in some sense in codes, the instructions for building the 248 dimensional object.

Speaker 1:          01:27:43       So somebody probably pushed an eight dimensional thing into two dimensions for your viewing pleasure. And does this accurate, like when you're looking at this, this image that we're seeing, does that make sense to you? I mean, I could make, I can relate it to things that make sense to me. If the idea is, you know, can I look at it the way I'd look at a barcode and say, oh, tied unscented. No, I have no idea. But um, but this is an accurate representation if you looking at it in two dimensions. Yeah. So what, what I'm, what I'm trying to say is you don't even know to worry about this pattern, right? Because you've never heard that these things exist, and this is like the closest that we come to, you know, genuine mysticism where we have these objects. If there are aliens, they know about ie eight because the eight or the aliens one ea does the alien.

Speaker 1:          01:28:37       I've been, I mean, I, we'll go to this later. I don't want to interrupt your story again, but I have an idea. So what I'm, what I'm trying to get at is this is the majesty and mystery of being a mathematic mathematician or a physicist. These findings. So if I was to say about dungeons and dragons, you're given these dice where the normal day is always a cube, but the platonic solids, you can have an octahedron tetrahedron, Dodecahedron, icosahedron, all these things. There's an analog of those five platonic solids in the next dimension up. So I think they're called convicts polytopes. So each one of those objects has an analog one dimension up, but was found out in the late 18 hundreds that there's a new platonic solid and dimension for called the 24 says you want to bring up the 24 cell and find an animated video of somebody rotating this thing. So like this is something that Plato knew nothing about. We don't really understand what it's doing there in four dimensions. These are like communications from uh, the cosmos. So this is like when Jodie foster was in the movie contact and they were getting them signals about how to make the time machine maybe or the portal machine. Yeah. But this is on this stuff just doesn't come with an instruction manual. So part of it is you can prove that these things are there

Speaker 1:          01:29:57       and you don't know why they're there and some of them touch everything and some of them have yet to touch almost anything. And it's like a communication from pure design that there is so much beautiful structure and so much grace in the universe that we're just,

Speaker 1:          01:30:15       what the fuck is this doing here? What is it? Right, well what is everything, right? What is the whole thing? No, I mean look, if you accept three dimensional space, um, or let's say this glass right? If you accept this glass, I understand that a circle can spin the glass. The Circle circles worth of symmetries tells me what to do to spend the last. That's not that confused, right? Why is there something that the analog of a circle where a circle I would call one dimensional because it's got one degree of freedom. This thing is 248 dimensions and it doesn't seem to live to symmetry. Tries it in the jargon. We would say it doesn't have a, a, a defining representation of lower dimension. So normally you have something of low dimension and you say what are its symmetries? Symmetries are of higher dimension. This thing seems like the first thing it wants to symmetries as itself. So it's kind of self referential. It's kind of onanistic. So it's like a zero point of creation.

Speaker 1:          01:31:19       That's poetic language and I would groove on that after 11:00 PM, but I wouldn't call it that right now. I would say I was trying to pick somebody up, hey, zero point of creation, right? That's a sexy word. It's a sexy way of describing it, but like if we were saying the big bang existed and that means some point in the history of the universe, it was this really tiny thing and it decided for whatever reason something happened and it became this enormous thing. Sure. Possibly enormous thing and it had. There had to be a point where it started. Right, but so what I would say is we can competently take that story back to a and then we have to say we don't really believe that we have any insight beyond that point, but people want to go there anyway. We absolutely know that it was tiny, small, like a smaller than the head of a pin. The whole thing. I'm always uncomfortable saying the settlement. You can, you can say consensus. You can say a lot of stuff about very early, very small and it could. That could turn out to be wrong

Speaker 2:          01:32:26       in a possibly long ago, 14 billion years ago in our minds. As far as tough for a guy like you mathematics, you see it on your numbers and paper. It all computes. You see the numbers. Fourteen dollars billion is a number that makes sense for sure. But conceptually like for a dummy like me, 14 billion is like if I really, if I'm being honest, do I do I really have an accurate understanding what? 14 billion but, but it's uneven Weinberg doesn't feel $14 million either. Right. But you know, 100 yards is 100 feet, 100 yards. I'm like, that's too far to shoot a bow. Like you got to get a little closer to you. So you have some, you have some kind of an intuition pump. Well, you know, distance. It's a rational distance that you see on a daily basis. One hundred yards is a long distance. A mile gets a little weird.

Speaker 2:          01:33:12       Like is that a mile away? How far is that? Oh, it's six miles away. Wow. I didn't think it was that far. Right? Like there's, there's weirdness in distance, right? But when you get to a hundred and 40 million miles, okay, I give up, but you get to 40, get fatigued, get fatigued by that stuff that other people get energized. Like, yeah man, you have no idea how long ago that it's humbling, right? But then there's the concept of infinite, like this is one of the things that Krauss said, or maybe it was Sean Carroll that said, it's really not that we know that we can see 14 billion years ago, it's like, but that's just as far back as we're capable of seeing right now. And even if we did go further, the light is actually moving slower. Like you wouldn't be able to see it.

Speaker 1:          01:34:01       Right, right, right. So you have this thing about what the spacetime metric, which is sort of how things are, feel like they're moving apart. You know, Einstein said four degrees of freedom plus rulers and protractors equal space spacetime, right? So a spacetime metric is a collection of rulers and protractors. So I can do length and angle, including lengthen the time direction and that generates a derivative operator, which we talked about before, which is rise over run relative to accustom reference level. The customer reference levels generate the staircase that we did and that generates the curvature tensor which generates gravity. So strangely with all of this kind of like woo woo stuff that we've been doing, we just came to a much better description of what theoretical physics actually looks like. It's four degrees of freedom, plus we're losing

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       protractors gives you derivative operators with customer reference level. The customer reference levels don't knit together. That leads to an escher staircase. The degree of this is the curvature tensor. The curvature generates the gravity, which is what's keeping you and I in our chair. I really appreciate that. You're understood. You're explaining this in a way that you hope that someone can understand. Well, I'm not afraid, I'm not a physicist, but you're explaining it very well. The problem is for someone like me, I lack the tools to put there. I don't have enough open slots for these concepts. So it's like. It's like if you were explaining to me complex arguments in French, but I didn't speak French, so you were saying, you know, bones, it means this and then you're explaining all these other words and then you throw it all together. I'm like, what? And then it's cultural references and you have to deal with the fact that there's some historical precedent to certain types of behavior that I hadn't taken into consideration because he's a French people that have lived in this way.

Speaker 2:          01:35:55       Oh whoa. Okay. But look, look, that's nothing compared to what you're trying to. Let's drop some. Uh, so, so you do this thing about like, well for meathead, like me, I'm definitely a meat head. Stop it. Listen, I know me better than you know me. That's true. But you're also less honest than you think on this particular topic. It's part of your chart that, look, when we hang out, we hang out usually in a comedy club or at somebody's house, right? We don't say, hey, we're going to take the afternoon off and we're actually going to learn theoretical physics. Right? Right. So when I went to a, I did stand up for the first time, as I told you in Arizona, was there. Oh, it was insane. It was crazy. Yeah. You try and explain fucking corks to people.

Speaker 2:          01:36:40       It'd be. There'd be some real humor in that. If you could boil it down. Three quirks. Go into a nuclear. Yeah. There's like a way to do it. I don't know. There's a way to do it. Okay. Well, the who was the guy who did the. Some guy was doing. He was praying, Cowen was doing quantum jokes. What was he saying? Do you remember? I forgot. He just. He had a bunch of words that he did very, very quickly and it kind of hung together. I was like, wait, what? Yeah, that sounds like Brian. Yeah, he reads a lot, but it's a clever boy. When I, when I had to do my 10 minutes of Standup, man is that craft? It's deep. It's hard because you have to. It's not just like telling jokes at a party. It's really. You have to measure the way the audiences laugh comes whether you're taking them along or you going to divert all, all sorts of things that I never thought about before.

Speaker 2:          01:37:24       Do you know how you feel when you talk about the hop thing that it's a part of everything? It's one of the most important things and yet very few people know what it is. Maybe a thousand people understanding on the whole world. What's odd is that number is probably identical to the number of legitimate professional standup comedians in the world. That's why when I say legitimate, I mean someone who can craft a new hour every two years. It does netflix specials who headlines all over the country. It's small, good, traveled all over the world and do standup. It's an small number

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       of humans.

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       Not only that. My guess is that the number of people that you think are at the very top of that craft, like when I really think about who really knows theoretical physics, right? It's tiny. It's like fuck, it's smaller than 50. Yup. Yup. Guys that I would

Speaker 3:          01:38:11       pay to see live or women that are paid to see live, it's less than

Speaker 1:          01:38:14       50th, less than 50. And so part of our problem is that all of the stuff that humanity is developed is often resident and a tiny number of minds and I feel very vulnerable about the theoretical physics has been faking that it's in a healthy state for a long time. We are so vulnerable on the doorstep of actually cracking this puzzle in my opinion. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:38:40       that's where our comparisons in because pretty much anybody could do stand up if you put enough time to it, if you're silly, if you figured out the craft, but would you guys are doing is not just really rare, but also the, the barrier for entry, like the cost of entry is exceptionally high. Like you have to spend an inordinate amount of time studying and understanding this stuff just to get to a base level of what you've been able to explain. You've been explained like some really difficult concepts to the lay person that must've taken you fucking eons to learn and understand all your study of mathematics and of geometry and have all that. But I'm an imposter. How so? While I'm not a physicist. Right? But you understand it. Maybe don't practice physics. No, no, no. I understand it.

Speaker 1:          01:39:31       Well, no, it's something more audacious than that, which is that, um, when you see a, you know, a 10,000 hours only sign a, you know, only those who've done their 10,000 hours can come in. My middle finger goes up. I'm like, I bet it's not 10,000 hours or if it is 10,000 hours, I'm willing to get 80 percent of the juice in that orange with like 10 percent of the effort. The 10,000 hours thing to me is a, it's cute, but it doesn't factor in for phenoms. It doesn't.

Speaker 3:          01:40:07       There's a lot of people that come into anything. Whatever it is, with some natural abilities that are pretty undeniable.

Speaker 1:          01:40:15       Um, you know, that's a weird, that's a weird equation. But take, take something very simple like the harmonica. Yeah. Most people don't know that that sweet blues sound on a harmonica comes from not using it the way the manufacturer said, which is called straight harp and using it instead the way African Americans figured it out, which is it's much cooler to base it around a hole that nobody was expecting to draw rather than for blow. And that gives you a seventh chord. That sounds like sweet blues music. If you start giving us some of that right. I don't know how will work.

Speaker 2:          01:41:10       Okay. That was. You got to move, but. So what's the traditional way of using it? What would it sound like?

Speaker 5:          01:41:18       Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:41:22       I think that would be carmen pouring his fuck boy. People music. Boring as fuck white people. God Damn it. Why people at Carmen's alright, but look, that's not my point. Who knew when you get one of these things as a party favor as a kid there's somebody says, Hey, don't do that thing where you put your mouth over it. I'll sign it. You know? But who knew that that's the coolest. This. Yeah, but the idea is that there's something called tongue blocking. There's something called cross harp and there's something called the one four, five progression with a scale that no music teacher ever taught you in grade school and piano. All right, so there's four secrets

Speaker 2:          01:41:57       and now suddenly the world opens up. I mean, when I opened for Jordan Peterson, Dave Rubin invited me and they said, why don't you play a minute worth of harmonica at the Masonic Theater? So for 2,500 people, I became Dave Rubin's talking Harmonica Monkey. So I opened for Jordan Peterson. I said, rule number zero, life is too short not to play the harmonica. Everyone should learn to play the harmonica or know why they're not doing it. There's this great thing in the cal Berkeley fight song will win the game or no? The reason why if you don't play the harmonica, it's so nice. It's so simple. So few people do it. They're so small. Number of secrets. You have to have a reason because I can feed myself. I can. I can get housing, shelter, I can meet people anywhere in the world. All I have to do is carry around a piece of plastic with some metal on it or you can be annoying like a lot of people like turn that fucking guy off.

Speaker 2:          01:42:48       Why is he. Why is he playing that Goddamn Harmonica? I don't want to hear that. Put it back in your pocket. You could have your next champion. You already tainted in these people's estimation. Gets attention whore out of their mind. My life. Well, what's worse? A harmonica or a guy brings a guitar and start singing folk songs at a party on the animal house effect, right? Yeah. Beat him over the head with a guitar. You can shred. He's going to be fine. It's great. If you were looking to hear someone tread, that's that. Okay. All of these things are like options of financial apps and you can exercise them or you cannot exercise. You don't have to exercise, but there's an equal number of things that people would say that are like the Harmonica. Like you should be able to do slam poetry. Right? Everyone should be able to do slam poetry. If you can't do slam poetry, I can feed myself. I can help, I can. I can do slam poetry. I'll show up at a party and everyone wants to hear slam poetry. Is that true? You're just trying to beat me Joe. You're so adorable. It's fascinating to me. That's that harmonicas are this little

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       tiny thing that people have. Like there's not other ones. Right? There's like other things. I like these big old trumpet looking things like a harmonica is this little thing. Yeah, like how many little things do you blow? Well that's what are that powerful in terms of like the kind of music did it makes. Exactly. Isn't that weird? It is weird. Like there's no like balls, right? It's always that. It's always that little candy bar looking thing like there's nothing, no ball harmonica, comparable in terms of like musical instruments that does that little nut that has that kind of sound. No, that's what it's optimized for, but isn't that weird? Like there's two buzz and there's other things that are similar and then you get to like trombones and trumpets. Everything kind of makes sense. Then you got this little fucking thing, so candy bar thing, right? A mouth heart, a mouth harp. Ooh. What's that other one? They bought. Knowing, knowing, knowing, knowing, knowing these two Jews, those Jews. Old timey movies. Is that what it's called? Boring. Boring. Boring. Now this is like a weird word for it is a weird word for that thing. John Harp. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:44:56       Maybe I'm thinking of a complete. Okay. Yeah. That's one. Yeah. That's another weird one where you can play the spoons. Spoons are good. Well, how about that fucking Australian one where they blow into the big ones the most. That is like how hard were those guys trip and when they came up with that sound, why do I wear like if you're in this like Tuvan throat singing did that. He's good. Thank you. If you're on Haight Ashbury and there's a dude and he's got one of them diggory dues out fucking hat. You're supposed to throw some money in there. Just out of respect. This guy brought a God damn degree due to the corner. Well, you know the coolest recent one. It is crazy. Some noise from this motherfucker. Just give me a little bit.

Speaker 3:          01:45:45       That is dmt music. I know if you're tripping balls and somebody plays that you, it'll take you to a new dimension. So you've never accessed was kind of like the paint on for it to and everything. Oh, that's not true. Actually. It's quite interesting. The center center diamond church around the IOWASCA stuff has a lot of really interesting music to listen to it straight is the kind of mind mind blowing. Well, there's also, there's, I don't know if it's that one or the something do vegetal. There's one of those similar Christian based dimethyltryptamine Iowasca type churches that they sing songs about Jesus the trip balls and sing songs about Jesus and what's really weird about dmt in particular, and I guess you could say the same of of mushrooms, but mushrooms apparently when it synthesizes. Yeah, it's real similar in chemical content to what dimethyltryptamine is.

Speaker 3:          01:46:38       I'm going to fuck this up, but I think it's an n. dimethyltryptamine is dimethyltryptamine and then when it's synthesized by the body, when the body processes silicide than I think it produces something called for Fox for a lock. CNN dimethyltryptamine, I think it's real close. I might have fucked that up, but I think it's so close that it's like their cousins. Okay, so there's something about music in these things and one of the best ways to get out of a trip if you're, if you're really tripping balls with mushrooms, is the sing your way out of it. You can sing your way out of a bad trip. You can actually control the trip with good music. And one of the things that's really constant with Dmt is these arrows that these shaman will sing and these egos with symbols and like a little bit of drum and these like really rhythmic singing it.

Speaker 3:          01:47:32       It makes the hallucination dance in like a really obvious tangible way moves around itself and it changes in guides the trip. Well that's what I. my hypothesis has been that it's sort of some sort of. Yeah, I guess that's one right there. This is one of personally experienced. I've, I've actually tripped listening to this song and it was like these geometric patterns, these entities that seem to be conscious, they were like moving around. This is the guy, this is the Iowa scarecrow, this is the shaman blowing tobacco, this is part of the ritual. They actually below tobacco on you, why you you do that?

Speaker 3:          01:48:17       So this guy was just this little rattle and singing and sometimes there's actual singing, not just whistling but in their language, this beautiful soft, rhythmic sort of song and the hallucinations dance to this, to the sound of this music. Like they're supposed to dance to it like they're a part of like it's not just that you're having music on top of the psychedelic experience, but that they merge, they merge and the psychedelic experience experience is a hundred percent affected by this. So it's not just that there's chemicals that are interacting with your brain, your doing something to by responding to that music and then the music is doing something by enhancing the way your perception of this experience is and all of that is dancing together like they belong together. It's fascinating shit. Yeah. I mean my hypothesis has been that the music acts as a prosthesis to sort of lock you in because the experience is so powerful.

Speaker 3:          01:49:15       Yeah. I mean, maybe it's always a little bit weird, you know, try to imagine somebody says, do you want a glass of scotch and a shaman to go with it, what? You probably need one, but you know someone at a bar that's like, we're going to drink this, we're going to drink this good intentions and no one's going to be grabbing anybody's Dick. No one's no one's going and said, no one's getting rude here. There would be no wedgies, right? There'd be nothing. Nothing rude will be said. You will. You will think for a good solid five seconds before any hasty moves like let's, let's, let's

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       understand that I let it get great benefit going to get great benefit from this in terms of our ability to be loose and to be silly and to, to enjoy each other's company. But if, if a demon comes out during this time, you must address this demon personally on your own. Don't pull the demon out and throw it at the party. Right? This is good stuff. That's, but that's what happened. So that drunks, the throne, that dementia, that, that thing where they figured out that if you put a worm in the mescal stuff, that would be a great marketing device north of the border. Right? Cause you just tell some stories. So now we were going to open that. What that is is just think it's a marketing gimmick next and then. And then what we do is we found our own Tequila company and we only so exclusive that you can only buy it if you also hire a charlotte for the event will make tons of money.

Speaker 2:          01:50:34       Yeah. And if. What if the, the worm actually was psychedelic. Like what if there was a way we can genetically engineer a worm to be intensely psychedelic. Like the worm literally is made out of Iowasca like we. Why don't we put a toad in the misco? Well don't they do weird shit like that with a little take tomatoes and they'll like use [inaudible] frog DNA in the tomato to make it live longer. But isn't. There was some weird shit. They're already dealing with. Cool stuff. Is the green fluorescent protein stuff you can have glow in the dark rabbits and he makes these. Yes. Yes. Let's get some glow in the dark bunnies, man. They can do that right there is something like that. Right? So you have Jamie, do you have glow in the dark rabbits? No, but I do have the genetically modified potato with frog genes to resist pathogens while in the holy fuck. So how weird is that? GM potato uses frog gene to resist pathogen. So that's, that's real. Can we do. Can we do a GFP rabbits?

Speaker 4:          01:51:35       Yep.

Speaker 2:          01:51:37       So what were we on before this? We were talking about how we get to rabbits. Tequila with a fraudulent. So what if we engineer that little worm to be like a 100 percent dmt, 100 percent dsd where you get down to that worm and whoever chugs to the bottom and choose on that warm. Just call you immediately transformed. What the fuck am I watching? These are these glowing rabbits. Yeah. That is so weird dude. It's so weird. Hoverboards and archery stuff. We need rabbits. Who need. Now here's a problem, man. My kids have rabbits in there. Those rabbits, a little assholes. They don't. They don't give a fuck about each other. We have two of them is so rude. This is what happens. They're both males, unfortunately. Here's what happens when you get to mail bunnies and you put them in a gigantic chicken coop.

Speaker 2:          01:52:26       They fuck each other up. It's bunny UFC everyday with these little assholes. All they do is kick each other's ass. They chase each other around this chicken coop and when they get a hold of each other, they bite each other and they kick each other. They fuck each other up because they're both boys and they don't want a boy to be running as these two bunnies fucking each other out. Dude, this is what they do. Bunnies are fucking ruthless to each other. These two little assholes just chase each other all day long and beat the shit out of each other. That's all they do. Why don't you do commentary? I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna. Encourage their batteries. Ballard, comment. One of them is actually missing. Um, so here's what happened. We are chicken coop burnt down from the fire, but the chicken survived. One of them got scorched.

Speaker 2:          01:53:13       They all got fucking PTSD. It's crazy. I go near them, but they're alive. Right. So we had a maneuver them and move them. But one bunnies missing found one bunny. One bunnies missing. So I think it's better for the one bunny that survived. And the one bunny that probably got jacked by an eagle or some shit like that. That's a wraps on you had a good life. He beat the shit out of your friend for a year and a half solid. Just kick each other's ass. It's fucking horrible that his ears are totally jacked up to hear the shredded. Like a, like an old bag to the depth that you missed? I don't think so because there's no body. I think. I think a bunny got out and it probably ran away or who knows what the fuck happened at Coyote got it. Or some shit. I mean there's a lot of hawks, lot of hawks in my neighborhood.

Speaker 2:          01:53:54       It's most likely a hawk. Yeah. But whatever. There's one little bunnies by himself now. He's like the other asshole. They're both assholes to each other. It's not like one good bunny. They just find each other and like, fuck you. I imagined just that's all you do for years. That's bunny life. You get to male buddies together and everyday is fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck yeah. With they run at each other and one one's always trying to get away. One's always trying to eat and the other one jumped on him and start biting him and kicking him. And the other one we'll do the same and they'll rotate. You know, it's very funny. The uh, the last two Jews in Afghanistan, uh, both had to live in the synagogue. That was all the head left. That's really only help somebody. Somebody went, somebody went to go visit the last two Jews in Afghanistan and said like, why aren't you, why aren't you guys friends?

Speaker 2:          01:54:41       And one of them says here, I'll show you his small want to have lunch. The got the guy says, grow up. Did you see what I'm working with? And it's like the most Jewish conversation between the last two Jews, they can't get along. And so they're like the two rabbits that the, all the others went away, whether they're probably really horny and lonely and confused, I suppose. Yeah. I mean, what the fuck? There's only two of them. They need to get to Israel stat like, well, I think one of them died. And then the last one is just despite the last guy, someone talked to him. If it's possible for you to get to Jerusalem, that's your people, they'll just, you'll have a party over there. Everything will be great. Jewish food, everyone's speaking Hebrew. Everyone's united will like the last three Jews have. Carola. Was this young woman and two guys.

Speaker 2:          01:55:25       Just that. No, neither one of you forget this thing. I know. It's rough, man. It's rough. It's crazy to think that it's a country with zero Jews like zero. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nope. The whole country like, Whoa, whoa. That is. That is kind of this melting pot here, sir. Zero, zero melting. It was one ingredient, whole pot. That's all stu. I'd say it. It was. The Taliban actually really needed the Jewish community because they wanted to be able to say, we've had great relations with Afghanistan Jewish community. They just didn't say it was two guys, two dudes that hate each other. Exactly. Very polarizing. True. I don't know how we got into. Oh, glowing bunnies. I'm not getting any fucking bunnies, man. All right. If you get a guy and a girl together, you've got to fix the girl. Otherwise you're going to have a million bunnies and they're all going to be kicking each other's asses.

Speaker 2:          01:56:12       So they do the bunny apocalypse. Well, what's really fucked up his reading about animals that that fight like right out of the womb, how they kill their partner. They killed the good siblicide. Yeah. Pull up a obligate siblicide in blue. Nazca could boobies. What of those? What's it in Nazca. Booby. They live in the Nazca lines or these. What are these boobies? Jamie Hmi out here. We're hanging out in the word Boobie Boobie. I'm still still. How do you spell that? Naz, ca and then boobies. The usual man. I'm trying to remember what I was reading about where obligate siblicide when one animal comes out, the other one tries to kill the other one. Almost immediately. Hostile Hyenas, hyenas, hyenas. There's been. There's been evidence of hyenas attacking their sibling while it's in the amniotic sack and theirs. When they come out, the bigger one or the stronger one of the whatever one's healthy will almost immediately started attacking it.

Speaker 2:          01:57:21       Sibling and try to kill it. Pull up that if that's true, I'm pretty sure that's true, but I want to see. Boom. I went to this crazy rabbit hole about hyenas recently. What a bizarre animal that is. So this the false penis? Yeah. The false penis is just one aspect. Yeah. Everything. Everything. About 90 percent of the women die. Okay. Here it goes. Obligate symbols, similar size. When a sibling almost always ends up being killed. Fugitive siblicide means the suicide facul Tim, like it's a choice versus you've got to do a tative. Faculty tackled facultative syllabus. Siblicide means a siblicide may or may not occur based on environmental conditions. Okay, so it's sometimes will happen if there's not enough resources. So the idea is that the, the breeding cycle is retired, so you either make it or you don't. And so the danger of laying one egg and having it not work out is very, oh, this bird is fucking.

Speaker 2:          01:58:17       This is brother up and it has to be in front of mom and dad because you want to prove that you're worthy. Well that is insane, right? So Mommy, look at, he's beating it to death. So this is because there's not enough food, there's not enough food to do two. So the first one, the second one is a spare and the first one proves, proves that he's worthy by killing his sibling. The spare in front of the parents and says, yeah, you can invest in me. I got this thing, Jesus Christ. And what kind of bird is this is probably Nazca or blue footed boobies is my guess. That is insane. That is insane. It's hard to watch. Well, this is what I said about biology. Biology cares about your feelings and the mom doesn't give a fuck about her. I don't know the mom the mom wants.

Speaker 2:          01:58:56       Look, mom's excited. This one's dying fucked up, and the mom's like, mom's excited. Hey, the older one knows what it's doing. He's viable. Jesus Christ. Nature is pretty brutal, pretty brutal. Now it's, it's bizarre seeing this from, Oh God, I don't want to see this thing slowly die, dude. It's bizarre seeing it from birds. But, uh, I think it's even more ruthless the way lions, hyenas, hyenas killing their siblings, that almost a, I think they were saying it's pretty universal. That is when the first one comes out and they tried to kill a second one with, you know, this thing about lion female lions getting excited by the murder of their children. Oh, so when the new, when the new mail takes over the pride, his first order of business may be, let's stop wasting resources on the previous daddy's a offspring. So what happens through this same kind of thing? The hyena gets out and immediately starts killing its sibling. They're fighting to the death right out of the womb. Look at this fucking mad battle as babies. Look, it's still got the sack on it and they're just trying to kill each other. This is a particularly ruthless animal. There were. There were saying that 60 percent of hyenas die as a trying to get out of the tube. Wow.

Speaker 2:          02:00:15       What? I didn't know that. Yeah, 20 percent of women die. Whether females rather die when they're giving birth, but that's because of our crazy brain to body ratio. They have no female hyenas. Oh, giant Dick. Sorry. I thought you were talking about high rates of human mentality. Female Hyena die 20 percent of the time when they're giving birth because the baby doesn't come out right. Like they have this crazy, you know they have a penis that is actually a vagina. It's a. it's an enormous, huge and gorge clearest. It's far bigger than the males. They have to pull it back so the male can copulate with them, but then when they give birth he has to come out of that Dick and they don't. It doesn't always come out right, so system. Yeah, Google that because I might be wrong about the numbers, but it's some exorbitant number of babies die and a huge number of women.

Speaker 2:          02:01:04       Women. I keep saying women, female, Hyena is done. Yeah. That's why I fuck up, but there are also weird and that they're way bigger than the males and that's the because the males won't let the babies eat, so this one of the things they think like if somethings are scavengers, the males are trying to push out everything smaller. So because of that the females have to get in and go fuck off. The kid has to eat like even if it's their kid that's cool. Sixty percent suffocate on their way out. Sixty percent of them die on the way out. Yeah, and I think it's 20 percent of the females die during childbirth as well. Pretty sure. That's what I read, which is fucking. I mean, 60 percent though. Imagine 60 percent of all kids die on the way out and then the ones that don't die, if you got two of them, one of them kills the other one.

Speaker 2:          02:01:49       It's a rough neighborhood. Oh, it's a matriarchal society and they give birth through that fake penis. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. What is the purpose of the fake penis? What does take peanuts is a dominate the men. They get on top of the band and they go, listen, bitch, so it's going to be. And they got a big old strap on. They pegged their men at all. Male hyenas are cooks. They all take. It's crazy. It's crazy. That's where we're heading as a condition. Diameter. Really? Jesus. Ouch. Tight squeeze that. That creates a high death rate for first time mothers. Yeah. High death rate is and say here, how many. But I think it's 20 percent. You've ever seen the, the, uh, like the full human cliteracy? Yes. I've seen one. Have you? Uh, not in the wild. The full, the full clitoral. No, I know.

Speaker 2:          02:02:35       I've never seen it. Like a biological. Can you pull up the internal clutters internal clinic? I think it was only discovered. Is it not allowed to be shown to quickly? Think about that. Yeah. It'll cause trouble. Well, you could pull it up and just don't show the world. Just show us if you. I think if you put that on Youtube, we will be monetized and possibly kicked off their network to Google that yourself. Yeah, Google it. You weirdo and be careful of the wrath of the government. Enormous structure that I think we didn't fully understand. I don't understand how we could have missed it, but my understanding was we didn't fully understand the internal cliteracy there on the left below. It looks exactly like this sort of space ships from war of the worlds 1953. It's all that stuff on the outside. All you see on the outside, that little tip at the top, we're going to get in trouble.

Speaker 2:          02:03:26       They get mad at us. Does that picture make you horny? No, not at all. Afraid, doesn't it? It seems like an alien. I should shoot laser blogger like that's the Ridley Scott Alien. The face hugger. Yeah. Well, just the look. It's very weird that we've just come to accept what the shape of the body. His body is very bizarre. I mean if we were all shaped like sting rays and we saw a person, we'd be like, what in the holy fuck is that thing with? It's articulating fingers and it's moving. It's eyeballs, rounds, sniffing things, but its nostrils. Like we just accept the fact that this shape is, is normal, that it makes sense. Well, this is why cephalopods from last time when we were talking about the cuttlefish. Yeah. My, I just learned something new, which is the cephalopods are under consideration to be the next great model organism for biology.

Speaker 2:          02:04:18       So if you think about how weird it is that some branch of the phylogenetic tree is so far distant from us that these mollusks have such advanced minds and you know, their skin is the wonder of the world for sure. Um, nobody knows quite how all of that. Not only do they have these chromatic to get the camouflage right, but they also changed the texture of their skin to mimic things like coral and all this stuff. Oh, wouldn't it be cool if we made cephalopods the next great model organism and then we started doing comparative, like not only neuroanatomy but connectomics where we're trying to study how their brains are organized because they're so far away. They're probably the closest we will ever get to meeting aliens. I think I said that the last time was here and I'm really excited if that goes forward. Well, it really doesn't seem like anything else.

Speaker 2:          02:05:08       Right. You know, whether it's a cuttlefish or whether it's an octopus like it, you're like, oh, it's Kinda like a squid. Like, yeah, a little bit like a person's like a monkey. Yeah. But like real different than Nautilus is the craziest. Maybe the cuddle fish is the most interesting for sure. But they're both intelligent. Right. But like you regenerate. That's another part of it. That's bizarre. Yeah. Well it'd be fun to do. I mean, I would imagine that Knutson Salamanders in the tetrapod category would be the best for us to study for regeneration. I like how they regenerate up to a point like nature say. Yeah, you can grow an arm back. Kinko head back. Sorry. Fuck face. That's a wrap. Yeah. You know, you lose your head nature. Like, ah, you gave up a big piece. He gave up the queen over. Yeah. Game's over.

Speaker 2:          02:05:56       So you thought if you lose your tail, like that's debatable. Do you grow your tail back? We could do that, right? Lizards grow their tail back, but they only grow like most of it. They don't grow the whole thing, but the knutson salamanders seemed to have very high regena and you can just get in an arm off over and over again. There is. We can't cut their head off. Yeah. Why do you wanna cut their head off? Well, I don't, but I mean just saying it's weird, like you can't like chop them in half from the waist down. They don't seal up and grow a new waste. Like that's it. You can only get rid of the limbs. Yeah, but you can get rid of the limps. Like nature is evolved a strategy for dealing with probation. Just give them the arm given the ticket pop.

Speaker 2:          02:06:35       What do you make of the fact that we had this, a successful head transplant in monkeys in the early seventies and then we walked away from it. Probably good move. Otherwise chicks at Beverly Hills, it'd be getting new bodies just getting their head screwed on to new release. Yeah, get new heads. Yeah. People would figure out a way to transplant the brains. Everyone wants to live forever, man. I just have an 800 year old brain and talk about how your old motorcycle victim. Yeah, so people are going to start doing well then. I guess it's thing that we walked. I thought it was kind of a a weird move that will succeed at that and then say, okay, too much can't handle it. Do you think that's what they did? Oh, it was probably hard to get funding. People thought you were playing. God, the guy who did it, I think it was maybe his name is Robert White and he was a devout Christian, so it was really.

Speaker 2:          02:07:23       It was good because you know, there was a lot of this reverence for the human form and if a religious person is doing it, we feel better than if somebody is like desecrating. Right, right. Some atheist as scientists, but he's cutting heads off dogs and Maria attaching them to monkeys. Yeah. That's what's also like. We think of it as like, okay, it's one thing if you're trying out medicine on a monkey that might save babies, but it's another thing if you just say, hey, what happens if I cut this monkey's head off, stick it on another monkey where there's all this crazy. I don't know if you've ever seen this. The Russians had this film introduced by Jbs Haldane, great English biologist who was also a communist and therefore very pro Soviet, and there's this experiment, uh, was experiments in a continuation of the brain after death and they hook up the head to an artificial circulatory system and they sort of continued to have interactions where they swab the head and they get the eyelash movement in the tongue comes out and eat things.

Speaker 2:          02:08:29       It's quite interesting. I would recommend it. Yeah. How Dean has one of the greatest quotes, not only as the universe queer, then you suppose it's queer. Then we can suppose what a great quote. He was also the inordinate fondness, a Beatles guy, inordinate fondness needles. The Archbishop of Canterbury found himself, I think, seated across from how Dane and wanted to needle him because he was a communist atheist and he said, you know, tell me what, what, what does your study of the biological would inform us about how great creator and how they shot him back. He said that he has an inordinate fondness for beetles because beetles are so highly speciated. And what was his reaction to that? Well, I think it was a different era, like smoked burn, but like to our, to our way of thinking. It's not that hard of a burn. Well, we're really committed to the idea that all the stuff that we can do manipulating the planet, sending rockets into space, that that's more important than what an ant does.

Speaker 2:          02:09:29       What we're really committed to this, that our significance, although it's clearly if we're working together, we believe in a sense of community. It's more important to eat each other. To us it is, but to the whole thing is it really more important? Says you mean if people didn't exist, we were wiped off the planet by all the other animals. Would it be okay? Really? Would be okay. I mean, we would gain and lose more predators and we wouldn't be controlling the population. Sure. But if all the aunts went away, that would be a wrap. Yeah, that'd be a wrap. We're done. No more people. This hasn't been widely decided that if we lost all insect book, especially all ants like it probably would collapse all the ecosystems that we need to sustain human life. I have a feeling that those waterbury tardigrades would be like, suck.

Speaker 2:          02:10:18       I got rid of the ads were the only ones left. Well, we wouldn't be able to make it, but a lot of shit would make it a lot of other stuff. That's true, but the thing that I think maybe we'd make it anyway. Maybe they're wrong. Just don't understand human trying to freak us out. Yeah. Maybe didn't read the Fi. Find out if that's true. If all aunts died, human beings would go extinct. Just Google that I think. I think I read a paper proposing that and they were explaining the critical role that ants play in all these different ecosystems and how the bio mass of ants worldwide is equal to or greater than the biomass of human beings. Okay. I don't have any intuition around that. Yeah, sounds reasonable though. I'm pretty sure that's true. And so, but our ideas that were more important. Well, we are. I have cable. Yeah. Yeah. That's why I think we're more four g, four G. okay. That maybe that's more important. I have a 70 inch television and, and I, I have an Iwatch. Yeah. It must be more important than stupid. Fucking ant was dirt house.

Speaker 2:          02:11:26       If I can just piss on your house while I go jogging. Yeah. I'm a more. A more important thing than you. Yeah. I don't know. My intuition half your people by pissing on you. Yeah. Obviously nature is want to protect you. You got your house in the dirt. It's a whole mound. Okay. I don't know why I want to get serious on. You're just trying to fuck with me.

Speaker 1:          02:11:49       The really interesting thing about humans is that we're the only species that understands what game we're in and we can reject the game. Every other species is playing the game. So, you know, you, you know, my brother very well, very surprising to me that my brother only wanted to have two kids and didn't want to spend all his time down at the sperm bank. Uh, you know, making donations. I said, you're an evolutionary theorist. You ever think it's kind of weird that you're not playing this game very effectively? And he shot me back this thing he said, if you actually understand the game, why would you want to continue to play it? I thought that was really interesting that somebody who sounds like his wife

Speaker 2:          02:12:26       does want anymore kids rationalizations. I get it, bro. Yeah. The article I found says all all insects dying, not just answer, Oh, insects. And we take 50 years for people to disappear for that. According to this, a science explorer article, um, find out the biomass of ants because that's even trippier

Speaker 1:          02:12:51       open. I'm, but I want to get rid of this anti human thing because I'm not answering. I know. No, you're assuming neutral. Knowing biologically neutral. If I just looked at it objectively. Yeah, I know. I said you don't think so. You think it's more significant because we're more significant to each other? Well, there's no significance in the whole game if you just take completely materials. Like what do we care is one rock, one SPEC, big deal. Right? So the problem is if you accept that as an answer, then you've kind of failed by just taking the nihilist way out and to me like they have this annual question, that edge.org, and then finally the guy got exhausted and want to ask another one. So I'll finish this up quick and then we'll you think I'm

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       sorry. No, you want to take it and do our aunts outweigh humans? Individual workers way an average between one to five milligrams according to the species. When combined all ants in the world taken together way about as much as all human beings. That's interesting. Wow. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's fucking bananas. Who they are, 15 to 20 percent of the terrestrial animal biomass and in tropical regions where answer especially abundant, they monopolize 25 percent or more. I'm an after I have a buddy of mine, Brian Cowen, Ryan accountant used to, uh, he, when he was in college, he spent some time in the jungle. He was thinking he was going to be a biologist and he was going to study insect who's going to be in, what is it in insectivore. And so they had to sleep in these elevated tents and they had to paint like some sort of like Turpentine type chemical all over the posts because of they didn't.

Speaker 3:          02:14:35       The ants would crawl up the post and eat you and your sleep would literally climb in your ear and start eating you and tell everybody and you would die that way. Like people have died and elephants have been eaten by ants and he said, you can hear them walking in the jungle like in the night you hear, you hear the footsteps of fucking ants because there's so many of us. If you're in the wrong place at the wrong time. And there's a path of these motherfuckers moving your way and they send a signal that we got something here and they crawl up you, they just all start crawling up you. And there's so many of them, you can't avoid them

Speaker 1:          02:15:13       because they're not really separate animals right there. Use Social Hymenoptera has this weird property of this haplodiploid structures so that the females are highly related to each other. And so in the same way that your cells aren't individual animals, they all conspire to create you. There is a sense in which in this world of bees and ants and wasps and things. Hi, my Hymenoptera, the real entity is the colony. It's not the individual, right? So, you know, if I took a cytological approach, um, to you and I just went set cell by cell, you know, you're, you're this collection of, uh, you know, 10 or 50 trillion separate entities. And that's what makes ants so terrifying is that, you know, Kropotkin and the great anarchistic a sort of an amateur naturalist. And he, he would look to natural systems and say, why can't humans cooperate like this? The point is, we're not structured to cooperate in this use social fashion. The way they cooperate is so uncanny. When those leaf cutter ants designed those intricate cities with, they have places where things for meant and were gases are released through holes in the ground and it doesn't make any

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       sense that this little tiny brain could figure out this enormous structure, but somehow or another when combined, and not just any brain, right, not just one, one version of this, but millions and millions of these designs appear all over the world and they see if he could find that video. Have they filled a leaf cutter ant colony? They filled the home with molten metal. Yeah. It was something like that. Yeah. I think they. They flooded it with concrete. They flooded concrete in all the holes and then they dug out everything around it so you could see this structure and then they explained what. This is really well thought out, like they have portals and they have the. This is how they get the food in and this is where they take the leaves and they, they, they let them rot and turn into mulch and there's like a gas remedies distributed loosely coupled system would.

Speaker 3:          02:17:23       It makes it seem so amazing. It is utterly amazing. But if you think about it as individuals making decisions that conspire to create these, these structures, it's less, it's, that's more amazing than what it is, which is, it's a loosely coupled, a distributed system, you know, so that's how a bee hive will send out explorers and they'll report back and they'll do the dance and the dance communicates the information and you get all these coordinated activities. Um, in what other systems do you suppress the fertility of females because the relatedness is so high. This is gorgeous. Yeah. This is the video we're talking about. So this is really huge too. And they have these looks like tunnel systems and then they lead to these big circular areas where they're really almost uniform in size and it's a really strange way or similar in size. They.

Speaker 3:          02:18:26       So they have these pathways that go to these like rooms, you circular rooms and there's just this incredible network of these tubes and circular rooms that they uncover and it's fucking enormous when you look at how big this thing. I mean if you had to like how big is that? Was that 80 feet across, 90 feet across or something like that. Good, good. So they're continuing to dig this up. They're not even done in this video here, but you see all the pipes that extend to the left and to the right. So they've developed some sort of complex civilization, some weird bizarre network of these passageways and rooms and they do it just like this everywhere. So some pattern has emerged in their species that has set them up to act as this collective group and then operate in a similar fashion all over the world. Wherever they exist in that sort of with that kind of dirt they can manipulate, right? That that's dad alone is one that is a massive mystery. Hey, how a little tiny thing with a brain that's almost imperceptibly small.

Speaker 1:          02:19:39       This is like tiny little head, his little head was he figured out that whole, how do you figuring out tunnels that he's not really not. This is what I'm trying to get out there working together. Okay. So if you look at, for example, Si elegans, the nematode with a thousand cells for the entire body plan, 300 of which are neurons. We have a complete map, not only of the cell lineage diagram, which is how this thing unfolds from a single fertilized egg, but we also have a complete wiring diagram of its nervous system. So this is something that locomotive moves around and eats, has sex and it's only got 300 neurons. Each of those is extremely primitive machine and they send signals to each other and we still don't know that how the thing really works. Even though we've got the entire thing mapped. Jesus, this was the great insight of Sydney Brenner that we would make the, the worm, uh, the great model organism because we could actually map everything about it. Right? And it is astounding to me how little we've learned. We've learned a ton from it, but I had thought that we would have gotten much farther and understanding the brain.

Speaker 3:          02:20:53       Did you see this recent discovery of a 25 foot long sea worm that apparently is not just one organism has many organisms together combined? No. Yeah. I've got to find out about that. Yeah. You got to see this fucking thing. It's insane and I think there's a very recent discovery, at least one this large and these guys are swimming around with this thing. It looks impossible. It looks like they landed on another planet and they're experiencing this thing like this thing, this whatever this is. I'm pretty sure that what I read, I read it really quickly as I was running out the door that it exists. Large eight mil eight meter worm, like sea creature stuns New Zealand divers, so they're looking at this thing, but I think there's many different organisms inside of it and I don't think it's one individual organism. Yeah. It's made up of hundreds of thousands of organisms. I've never seen that. Yeah. Like what? What is it like? What does that mean? Is this is a weird tube for folks that are watching this or listening to this rather, what we're looking at is these divers that are just tripping balls here, they're like, what in the fuck is this? And it looks like like an enormous tube, like Jelly fish type creature that's in the water. It almost looks semi translucent, right? Would you say? And this tour Finland, it's enormous. It's so.

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       It's like the size and what moves and changes, but at sometimes it's larger than a human waste or a human chest and other times it gets real skinny, but it's a fucking huge. Like look at that. What is that thing that. I'm stunned by the fact that it's like I don't understand what they're saying, that it's made up of hundreds of thousands of organisms. Like how is it made up of different stuff? Like what is it like? Have you ever heard of anything like this? I like the Portuguese man of war I think is like five different organisms, isn't it? Isn't it? The collaborate in effect really the Portuguese man of war is not like a one thing. Look at the size of that thing above the water. That is fucking crazy. Piracy home.

Speaker 2:          02:23:16       Just whatever the ocean is like that. Like we're all. We're trying to look into space. Like I wonder if there's aliens out there. There's no. Whether it's cuddle fish or octopus or this goddamn thing. Whoa. Pyro Psalm. What the fuck? That thing looks like. A geometric pattern. That's a nice one. Look at that. One of the upper right hand corner. Jamie, what does that weird looking fucking. What is that thing? 60 foot long jet powered animal. Oh God. It's like a civilization. It's like a ship of these things flying through the ocean. What? Have you ever seen this before? What the fuck is that? That is so weird looking. Uh, come on man. That looks like something from Avatar doesn't. Yeah, it totally does. Right? Like something that comes up that tree hopefully put it in the new movie. Yeah. Tell Call James Cameron. Look at this thing. So this is what those things are, but the other one is a very smooth or it's low resolution and we can't get a really good look at it. But that's what it is, is this collective group of hundreds of thousands of organisms that combined together and they're getting jacked by that turtle. All you bitches.

Speaker 2:          02:24:30       What a weird, weird organisms that look at this picture if you stuck your arm in it and it just. Dude, how bizarre is it? The disease of civilization of these things all combined. But what they are is individuals that operate as a giant tube.

Speaker 2:          02:24:51       You never heard of this before. Now I'm so happy we found something. You don't know about your stuff, man. That was fucking weird one man. But the. Yeah, the idea that the ocean is really an alien world. Yeah. Well the funniest part is when you hear these guys with their remote submersibles and they find some new life for them. Yeah. They're like, take me down. Believe me. Those. Wait. What does that feel like? They get really excited because it's, it's the ability to meet aliens. There are new things. Yeah. I mean we, we've Kinda sorta mapped out the stuff more or less or. Yeah, there's like a few weird things you find in the jungle. Weird bugs. Like where's that? Vietnam has some surprises for us here with fangs. Ever seen those? Oh, the Sulawesi boars or they'll the deer really damn empire, dear. I Dunno.

Speaker 2:          02:25:44       I Dunno about vampires here. It's the craziest looking thing ever. It's deer with fangs like crocodile look and fangs that come hanging down like this. If this is some jackalope thing. No, it's not. It's a weird little animal. It's not a big deer either. Well, do you know? Look at that thing vampire, dear. That's a real animal. Look at that. How fucking strange. What was it? What was in this coffee? Jamie? Look at that thing will get their fucking teeth on that thing. It's probably something akin to their antlers. They use it to defend themselves. Okay. That's not real. Not Real, because that's a mule deer, so that one that you just pick some photoshop bullshit. What's interesting is apparently I'm elk have these things called the people call them Ivoree's now, but they. What they are is at one point in time they had tusks like a boar, like giant toss.

Speaker 2:          02:26:40       It probably aided them in their fights and they eventually shrank and now they're just this weird sort of nubby thing. I'm actually have some here. I'll show it to you. Yeah. The after the podcast will show them to you, but they, they're this weird thing that's not quite a tooth. It's ivory. It grows inside their head. And at one point in time it was some kind of a weapon, just like their head is. I mean the antlers, you know, it's the largest. How do we describe this? What was the, the, the, the quickest growing thing in the animal world is the, the antlers of an elk because look how fucking huge they are. They fall off every year and they grow back every year and it's all just for fighting. And they used to grow back tusks to where they used to have. The acid tests were permanent, but they used to just.

Speaker 2:          02:27:29       That's just for Duking it out. It's crazy weaponry, sexual selection. Well, you went into a really weird thing and the Dung Beetle, um, there's a conserved system whereby in some dung beetles, the amount of weaponry you have as your antler is inversely proportional to the amount of military apparatus you have, where it counts. And so if you have really impressive weaponry, you're not able to do quite as much, and that may be the engine of speciations because the vagina and penis, that system is a lock and key. And so if something shrinks too much, then you can't necessarily get, get the Job Sofa, greedy. Dung beetle with giant horns just fucks everybody up. His genes can pass on. Maybe there's a certain amount of cooperation is needed in the dung world.

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       Can have an oppressor, can have a gang, is con of the Dung Beetle world, the Patriarchy and the Dung beetle world. Look at the size of the antler on that guy, but girls make fun of them. Probably the dung beetle world because like the guy with the Lamborghini, exactly like what's he doing over there with these giant? It looks like elk antlers probably is a tiny little dick. You want. You want to, God's just got little like that, like that guy probably probably hung like a roach. Right? Have a hunting question for you. Okay. I started looking into this primitive hunting thing. I was positively predisposed towards hunting and I turned myself off of. I mean I don't hunt, but I turned myself off of hunting by watching the effect of some of these people who are baiting and killing bears in ways that it just doesn't feel to me like hyper respectful and I wondered if there's like a deeper layer where if I got even deeper into it, I would understand it or am I actually correct that there is something weird about the effect of attracting some beautiful bear to a kind of easy place to kill it and then just getting super excited about doing it in well, how

Speaker 3:          02:29:38       your natural instincts, there's a reason for them and you're most certainly correct. It's, it's a weird feeling. The idea that you're going to trick this bear and thinking he's going there to eat and then you kill them. Bear hunting is different than any other kind of haunting in the. First of all, there's a lot of emotional attachment to it because people love teddy bears and things along those lines, but bears are this idea that they're beautiful. They've definitely are. They definitely are. They're also one of the more ruthless animals in the animal kingdom and they're all cannibals. All of them and the males don't. Don't just go after the cubs. They eat them and they go after them specifically to eat them, and then when the males get chased off the female, what year on cubs, and this is universal, there are also responsible for the death of at least 50 percent of undulate calves and Fonz, whether it's moose, cows, somebody.

Speaker 3:          02:30:31       I don't have any of these issues. So they also are really difficult to hunt and their populations thought by wildlife. Biologists are important to keep under control by all of that. So in areas of extreme density like forest, you will not kill them unless you bait. You will not. So if you one of two things has to happen. Either they have to use dogs, which is what they used to use a lot. These used to be California until the 19 nineties. They outlawed hound hunting and then the odd baiting around the same time. What they essentially did, northern cal in California is they outlawed bear hunting, but they didn't. You can still hunt bears, but it's extremely difficult, almost impossible with a bow or very, very unlikely, like your rate of success of extremely low if you want to control populations, if you like to eat moose and deer or you want to have them keep healthy populations and you don't want the bare encroaching on these rural homes and these areas, you have to control their populations and there's very few other ways to control them.

Speaker 2:          02:31:30       Relations other than baiting them, so assume that I was positively predisposed to hunting. I do think that they're beautiful creatures. I think they're emotional creatures, but I understand they're all. They're all beautiful. I think. I mean, I think the frogs are beautiful. They're fascinating. It's the effect that freaked me out. It should. It's a weird form of trickery and we don't think it's sporting right, but the idea is that if you really want to control their populations, you have to accept that this is a necessary evil so that I grasped that it's still at the level that the thing that surprised me was that the effect wasn't the expected effect of the hunter with reverence in some sense. Sufficient reverence for the kill. Yeah, that's what flipped me out. Well, there's people get excited and they get happy that they're successful because hunting is difficult and then if you take that into context, if you take that out of context and people get happy, especially when they're happy, they're getting happy around people that have no problem with hunting scene, one of the problems with respect is that it's assumed that you only have that respect if you don't have happiness.

Speaker 2:          02:32:43       That goes along with that. I understand that there is some amount of sadness, some amount of happiness is a weird feeling of loss, so there's a lot of weird stuff that goes on. Surprised, and the reason I'm asking you is, is that I had expected that I would have the difficulty bears equals teddy bears. I get past that. I keep going around this whole thing. Then when I finally got to the end, it was just the. There wasn't the right balance between sadness, ecstatic elation.

Speaker 3:          02:33:14       It's hard. It's hard to. It's hard if you're not there experiencing it. It's hard if you're not involved in this hunt for many, many days and it gets very difficult when and you don't know if it's ever going to happen, but the bear hunting in particular, especially over Bait, is way more problematic psychologically. No, I think there's a really good argument and I support this argument that you must keep bear populations in control if you want people and and all those other animals to live in harmony. Got It. Because if you don't, there's nothing else that keeps your populations in control by that other than bigger bears. Grizzly bears and grizzly bears and they get out of hand our way scarier. That's a real. It's a real science, real giant problem in terms of our, our anthropomorphization of these animals, you know, attaching these human attributes and these human thoughts and thinking of them as our friends in the forest and then what they actually are the people that live out there.

Speaker 2:          02:34:09       No. My guess is that if I went hunting with you, I would expect to see elated after

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       three days of frustration on a, on a good hunt. I expect that you would use the kill responsibly, that you would forgo certain kinds of Kilz. I don't have any of those issues. I think. I think that where the issue is is that I wouldn't expect an unbalanced elation. Yeah, I understand what you're saying and especially an unbalanced elation when you're hunting over bait, right? For an animal that is not necessarily thought of in our culture as being an animal that you eat, which is bear and a lot of times people think that you don't eat them. Black bears in particular actually, they taste very good and people do eat them. When you deal with people, like I have friends, my friend John and Jen Rivet who live in Alberta and there they are hunting guides. It's a real necessity up there to hunt bears. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:35:09       Because there is nothing else. It's keeping their populations in check and if you ever go up there, you see an extraordinary amount of bears. Like you could see 19, 20 bears in a day. Well they're everywhere and there's a high density of them and they just decimate the deer population. They decimate the Moose population and there's some of them that learn that they can get into garbage cans, they can break into people's cars and destroy them. They've killed a few people, but it's pretty rare. Most of the time they realized that people are dangerous and they stay the fuck away, but it's not what I. What I appreciate his spot and stocking traditional prey animals. That's what I like to do. I like to spot and stalk deer and elk because I feel like first of all, they're the most delicious they make. Whether it makes sense or not, they make the most sense to me in terms of like a prey animal.

Speaker 3:          02:36:01       They're the ones that I covet the most. What I want to do is I want to go and get older, mature animals that are undulates. Whether it's a deer or an elk or the animal that has spread its genetics that has already, it's, you know, seven, eight years old, nine years old as animal that doesn't have much time left. If you get it now, you're probably getting it within a year of its death. Whether it's by natural causes, wolves, cold, starvation, you're. You're doing it probably the most humane you're giving it probably the most humane death. It's reasonably possible for this thing is unless it falls off a cliff, and even then it's the. It might survive that for a little while. When you're shooting an animal with an Arrow, it's dead in seconds. You know, you hit it in the heart and they shot an elk this year. It literally walked four yards and tipped over it. Just step, step, step, boom. I'm very impressed with the skill of some of these. I guess this is the print primitive hunting movement with spears and see that's. I think you should. I think it should be really careful about anything that you do. That's not that accurate. That's. That's

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       an issue. Yeah. That's a giant issue. Aba bowser extremely accurate, right? I mean there's guys that can shoot a paper plate at 100, 20 yards every single time. They could shoot a a good, a little plate like that. They'll. They'll bet their life that could drop an Arrow into that at 120 yards every single time. You can get good at that. You can get if you have good technique and reasonable control of your emotions and your anxiety in the heart, in the heat of the moment. You don't ever shoot anything in 120 yards though. You shooting at things 30 yards, 40 yards and the degree of success is very high with skilled hunters. If you are ethical and the shy, they're shot decisions. That primitive stuff. It's like, why? Why you throwing spears like, what are you doing? You're trying to prove that you're better than people that use a bow and Arrow, like this is not an accurate or effective thing.

Speaker 2:          02:38:07       I mean it kind of is, but you have to be like five yards, 10 yards. What do you got to be 15 yards Max. Even then, I think part of the thrill of it for them is putting themselves in danger. There's a little bit of that. If you're shooting, oh, you're going after a bear. Yeah. Like I've seen some of these things filmed where the person looks like they're up in there. I don't know what to call it, their little treestand Tristan, and that doesn't look like they're putting a lot of risks, but some of these people are clearly getting off on this is the primal hunt. Right, and this is. They're going backwards into something where the animal could surprise them. And what I. What I wanted to do is I wanted to reacquaint myself with, you know, now that I can, I can watch somebody.

Speaker 2:          02:38:55       Actually, in that moment, I'm trying to figure out what my ethics around hunting were and I thought that I had prepared myself and I just, I thought when I, when I saw you, um, find out where joe is because I have no question. Knowing your ethics and how you think that you would have a very subtle perspective on all these different kinds of kills. Which sorts of animals. Yeah. If you get to spears, you're in a weird place. Like, like you say, oh, I only spear wild pigs. We're trying to get rid of many way. Okay, well that's. We're in a weird place where in a weird place because ethically I think you have two choices. Three choices. Your three choices are rifle, which is number one, ethically realistically, because if you shoot something with a rifle, you, you can be really accurate, uh, like out to 100 yards a hundred percent of the time. Like unless it's crazy windy out or there's some weird conditions, altitude can affect ballistics but not that much out to 100 yards. You're fucking deadly. If you have a really good control, squeezing, squeezing the trigger, you're not jerking everything and not panicking, then Beau is second, you know, blow. It requires way more practice way, way more,

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       a fine tuning of your motor skills, but it's still possible. Okay. Then you have crossbow, which is even more effective than a bow, faster, more feet per second, faster feet per second so that it travels at a flat line because it's going quicker before it drops. They all drop at the same speed, right? Bullets and arrows all drop at the same speed. They just don't get there at the same speed, so the same amount of time, like if I'm shooting something at a hundred yards with a bow I am aiming with, with a site that is calculating for the fact that the Arrow is going to drop significantly in the time that it takes. If it's going 280 feet per second is like a normal speed for a good bow. The good heavy Arrow that's 280 feet per second that goes a hundred yards. A bullet is going to go 100 yards far quicker, but in the same amount of time it takes that Arrow to get to that target.

Speaker 3:          02:41:09       The bullet is going to drop the same amount as the Arrow and that's what most people don't understand, so across crossbow is more ethical because it's more accurate. It's have fewer moving parts. You could actually sit it on a rest and just squeeze the trigger easier to manipulate and the the Arrow is traveling faster so it's called a bolt traveling faster so it'll drop less after that chick gets squirrely after that. It's like you're throwing spears. Okay. You got what do you got? An adult adol. Okay. All right. Well you can kill things with it and people have done it, but it gets to. How accurate are you and it. What is. What's your ethical brain like? An ethical range for a really good hunter with a bow and arrow is probably 80 yards. I. It may be. Maybe it's a moose, 90 yards, something big, but with a spear like what do you got?

Speaker 3:          02:41:59       You got 10 yards so you know why? That's the question. Are you doing it for meat? Are you doing it because, um, is this your Mount Everest? You want to kill a pig with a spear? And Are you saying that a pig is not worth as much? So you should be able to kill it with a spear because these are all weird, weird decision. Just that weird decisions and people make those with bears. They make those decisions with black bears, like people that live where they consider them nuisances. Th, they, they killed them. I mean they used to be used to allow them to shoot a, you still allowed to hunt, used to be allowed to hunt black bears with a spear in Alberta until uh, a big scandal a couple of years ago where a guy filmed himself doing that. He shot a bear. He killed a bear rather with a spear and was hooting and hollering and people got a hold of the video and thought it was disgusting and protested it. And then, uh, people, uh, from underarmour dropped his, uh, wife from there, you know, they had this sort of sponsorship deal with them and uh, it, it, it ignited, it caused a rift in the hunting community. Some people think you should be able to hunt with a rock here, what you hunt with Sheila Hunt with anything and other people like, hmm, okay, but what are we doing? Are we just going out to get meat or are we putting on a macho performance of our.

Speaker 2:          02:43:19       But this is exactly what I wanted to get at, which is if you know that the population has to be controlled and you want the meat, yeah, then it makes sense to me that you have to open yourself up to some of the pleasure of the kill. That makes some sense. But what I saw just like flipped me out because if it wasn't a, it was, it was above and beyond. Yeah. I saw spirit and other things and you know, I was impressed by the, some of the skill. I'm impressed by some of the bravery, but like why doing it to population control, you're doing it for the middle. This was a surprise to me is that I got, I got kind of sickened by it. That's not surprising. It's not surprising, you know, I mean, I think if you,

Speaker 3:          02:44:02       if you were there, you'd probably be even more conflicted because you actually were there in the presence of the thing. Dying, watching bare die on video is one thing. But being there alive when they die as a completely different thing,

Speaker 2:          02:44:16       um, it's, it's, it's a very complicated thing because we have these deep set

Speaker 3:          02:44:26       emotional connections to certain animals that my friend Steve Rinella, who's going to be actually on tomorrow, he calls them charismatic megafauna that we have this different view of certain animals bears in particular. But if you use the animal respectfully, respectfully, and you kill it ethically and you do. I don't have any problem with hunting bears. In fact, I think it's actually, it really is a necessary task. It it's something that even if you don't like to hunt bears, if you're living in a place like Alberta, you probably should hunt bears because you should do your part. There's a lot of them out there and you know, one of the things that becomes an interesting relationship is a relationship between the moose hunters and the deer hunters and the bear hunters that they have. Kind of those smart ones have come to an understanding that even if I don't hunt bear, I need those people out there doing it, but it's how do you do it and why you doing it. I think I've seen animals die very quickly with the bone marrow. They die very quickly. I've never seen an animal die with a spear. Don't think it's necessary, but I don't want to be the person that tells you you can't do it. If you have an ethical range of five yards and you only hunt, bear with a spear at five yards and you kill it immediately, you hit it and kill it.

Speaker 2:          02:45:43       You're right. Then you're right based on the method. It's based on what? What are the ethical parameters around. I appreciate it also, so

Speaker 3:          02:45:51       I would kind of be a hypocrite because even though I can ethically kill something at 40 yards or just figuring out what the number is, depending on the size of the animal, right. Um, even though I can do that, I can do it way easier with a rifle. So why am I using a bow and Arrow? Why do I want to make it more difficult? Why am I making it more challenging? Why am I requiring myself to practice

Speaker 2:          02:46:12       this questions? You're very self aware. It's a very important question to ask because if I was just doing it just for the meat, I would probably use a rifle, right? Yeah. Yeah. I think that, that, that, that part of it has to do with the primal association with the kill. And then the key question is how do you want to indulge that? What is the set and setting, blah, blah, blah. So that was the, that was the thing that I found shocking is that I had thought, you know, I understood something about the need to control population. It's the effect which really killed me on this thing. Well, again, we're talking about bears, you know, as such as bears and other animals as well. Yeah, I mean I saw. I don't want to focus more on it necessarily, but it's just a question I had to ask you because I sort of. I was very surprised by my own reaction. Well, a lot of people are taking issue. My good friend Ben, oh Brian, who's a brilliant writer, who's actually also a hunter, is

Speaker 3:          02:47:09       advocating that people stopped taking what he calls grip and grins with a grip and grin as like say, if you shot a beautiful deer, you're holding the deer up by the antlers and you're smiling and he's advocating that those photos are problematic because people who don't hunt look at it like you're some blood thirsty asshole. That's super happy that something died. And that's not. Even though that's not how the people feel when they're taking those photos, what there are as happy. That something which is very difficult, which you know, especially with using a bow. Most people go home empty handed. It's it requires too much fitness, physical fitness, because you're going up and down these mountains and requires too much accuracy and training and technique and archery. Most people fuck it up and then there's dealing with anxiety. Most people fuck it up,

Speaker 2:          02:47:53       but

Speaker 3:          02:47:55       after it's all over, there's this great feeling of elation. Right? You did it. I can't believe it came together. Wow. Because it was probably not going to come together and people get happy. These are people again, that already accept hunting. Now if you take someone who is an animal rights activist or someone who deeply appreciates animals and then you show them that photo, they have a completely different association with what that photo means. What that photo means is, here's an asshole who's a trophy hunter.

Speaker 2:          02:48:21       Let me get my thing. I don't know any species that celebrates a kill for food with glee chips. Do chosen. Sorry. Sorry. You're right. Yeah. When they kill a monkey, they get pretty happy. Well then they do it socially and then they share it. Uh, you know, through altruism, they scream at each other in a. So that's the ships are my least favorite species. Almost evolved. They're terrifying. Yeah. It terrifying little fuckers. So we're. Where do you think we are on the political front? We haven't even touched that. Um, I think it's the same way as bowhunting versus spears rifles. It's all, there's this world's messy, you know, all these things are messy. Do you see a way in which this

Speaker 3:          02:49:08       political epic comes to an end? The only hope that I have is through reasonable dialog becoming an accepted and appreciated thing, a celebrated thing, and that this is possible that people can realize that there's some stupidity to this team mentality that we have is right versus left, which is almost all a good percentage of it is. He's assumed identities, right? These, uh, these predetermined patterns that get adopted in order to, as we first started talking about this, in order to establish yourself as someone who's in a group, you get accepted by this group and you see it left and right. I mean, I don't want to name any names, but there's a bunch of people that do it blatantly. You see them and I've even seen them switched teams and you see them switch teams and I don't, I don't buy the rationalizations when it comes to ideology, but I think is what they're doing is they're switching teams because they realized there's an end on this team and they can just say this is the problem with the team.

Speaker 3:          02:50:08       I used to be on those fucking losers and they're really benedict arnold, right? Like they probably have as much of an affinity to the ideas of one side. Is it do the other side. They just go all in on one side to get acceptance from the group. You just no way. People change their opinion that much over two years or something like that. Or they just decide this group makes more sense now and I've been attacked by people on the left so I'm going to go to the right or vice verse and usually what it is is when even when they say they've been attacked, like, oh you fucking baby, there's 300 million people just in this country alone. If you put something out there publicly and a thousand people attack, you don't act like you're being persecuted. Okay? You have an idea, you've, you've. You've launched that idea out into the zeitgeists and people took a big shit on it.

Speaker 3:          02:50:55       You know, whether it's people on the right are people on the left. You got to be able to argue your point one way or the other and not just immediately jumped ship on someone who shares ideas with you, decides that your idea sucks and maybe they're wrong and maybe you're right, but you've got to argue that through, but this idea of these partisan patterns that people just seem to automatically fall into there is so detrimental to dialogue there, so detrimental to us under really understanding each other and really having some sort of a sense of community. Right? This is a giant community of 300 million people. That's what it's supposed to be and this idea that it's this group is trying to fuck it up and they're trying to turn us all Muslims and this one wants everybody to be gay and this one wants everybody to fucking have free food and this and this.

Speaker 3:          02:51:40       This is nonsense. This is nonsense. We need better understanding and and you know the word better. Education gets tossed around a lot, but it also means better social understanding, better social education. I got at appreciation of who we are and why we think the way we think and calling out weasels on both sides of the pattern, like calling out weasels on the right that are pandering, that are just trying to get unit, the repeating a lot of these like accepted beliefs because they know that they can hit this frequency and a lot of people sing along or the same thing that other people are doing on the left. They're doing it on both sides. I think most reasonable people have a collection of ideas that they share from both the right and the left and most reasonable people are reasonably compassionate and I think that's one of the things that we're missing some reasonable sense of not just ethics, but an appreciation for each other for all of us as a group and do that.

Speaker 3:          02:52:41       I think if we can celebrate reasonable conversations and celebrate and understanding of other people's perspectives, be able to just look at how you're looking at things and have empathy. Okay. Let me see where you're coming from with this. Okay. Let me put myself in your shoes. Okay. Instead of just immediately like, fuck you, you cook and fuck you, you this. And instead of thinking about it that way, if we just tried to just everybody exercise a little bit more so we're a little bit more calm and come at this from a rational place and try to like realize like it's

Speaker 1:          02:53:14       exclusion. I've been experimenting with a very dangerous idea. I keep hearing, but chief inclusion officers, I thought about things from ecclesiasticus to every season. There's a purpose under heaven. So if there's inclusion, there also has to be exclusion and like d platforming or unplanned forming somebody is an act of exclusion. And very often it's very interesting that the people who are for inclusion are very focused on the need for deep platforming, which is an act of exclusion. So should we have chief exclusion officers that both monitor who is being excluded, including somebody like James Demore, uh, at Google, like is it ethical to exclude him or are there certain voices that need to not be at some tables in order for something to make progress? Because if you always have the voice that the most extreme that doesn't accept the game, then it's very hard to move forward within the game if you're constantly being reminded, you know.

Speaker 1:          02:54:14       So we had this, um, we have a series of situations in which it seems like some perspective that very few people hold terrorizes majority's or know group of people who sort of can more or less get along with each other and keeps pushing us into this very divided landscape. And I was just curious, you know, in terms of our group of people that we, we talk and hang out with a in common, um, where you see the high leverage, uh, is that we're, we've just finished the midterm. We've got this 20, 20 election. It looks to me like Hillary is Kinda I in whether she wants to get back in the game. Um, this trump thing has completely, uh, you know, it's like, it's like the dress is it black and blue

Speaker 3:          02:55:04       or white and gold for like eight years. And I just have you thought about how this ends? Well, I would never be so presumptuous to think that I have any idea how this ends. I have, I've proposed various scenarios to myself and I don't like any of them. I don't like where it's going because what I worry about, and this is also again hypocritical that because I think it probably should burn down and be rebuilt from the ruins, were not going to get such a clear thing to be clean. I know this isn't very clean either though. Honestly. It's that guy won. It's not clean. Have you heard this? He loves Putin. You know, this ain't clean. You know, the whole thing is weird. It's a, the bankers having the amount of influence they have, the fact that there's two lobbyists. What is it? What's the number like two lobbyists to every member of Congress or to lobbyists to every senator for the pharmaceutical industry.

Speaker 3:          02:56:05       By the way, the number of people that have influence over the way. Our laws are shaped. It's so fucking bananas right now. Right. So, so off the rails, is that what it is? Twelve, but I didn't type in specifically, but there's a 23 registered lobbyists for every member of. No, I think from the pharmaceutical industry, they were saying not just, I think it's two for every member of Congress in the pharmaceutical industry. Um, yeah. The question that you started out with like d platforming people, I think we're impatient and I think we're, we're. We really want to make sure that this vetting of ideas happens quickly because we see the answer, we, we see the solution, we see that this is incorrect and we see these people that think the world is flat, are idiots, and we think that these people that this I think this and think that we think they're all wrong and so we want to stop them from talking, but that doesn't work.

Speaker 3:          02:57:04       It just works for now. It, it, it. It oftentimes feeds those ideas and it also, it it. You have to question like, why are you so sure why you showed so sure that you are correct that you want. You don't just want your side to be heard exclusively. You want to. You want to silence these other people's ability to participate in this argument, even if they're totally wrong. I think that's dangerous because I think that the way to fight off ideas that aren't good is to introduce ideas that are good and you're gonna. You're gonna have a bunch of people that agree with ideas that are bad, but I think that that's a part of this whole figuring things out, like you need to have bad ideas floating around there to appreciate good idea, so if all the ideas are good, like what do we do get it out against.

Speaker 3:          02:57:56       It's not bad to have these bad ideas broadcast. What's bad? To not have someone, hey, these are bad ideas, but I need to see the pitfalls of racism. We need to see the pitfalls of crime. We need to see the pitfalls of corruption. We need to see it in action. I think it's like stock market, swindling. I think in a lot of ways it's important. We need to understand that this is a pattern that people fall into continually over and over again when they have control over the money, when they have control over the way they move the numbers. What do I do this? How about if I tell you that this is going to go down and then you invest some money and I put some money in your bank and we work together. Let's make some money because what people do right, if they just fucking do it over and over and over again, should you punish them?

Speaker 3:          02:58:32       Yes, absolutely. But I think it's kind of important to see some fucked up behavior just because we're not done. We're still in some sort of emotional and psychological and even physical evolution. We're in the middle of this thing and I think that bad ideas facilitate comprehension, like these really shitty ideas that a lot of people have. What they do is they facilitate a comprehension of why we think dumb shit. And sometimes you don't know why people think dumb shit until you see someone over and over again that thinks dumb shit and you get to see that, whether it's Alex Jones or whether it's to fill in the blank, what guide you want deep, but I don't. Okay, so here's my thing. I want a lot of our leading experts, the platform. Okay, well, you're going deep. The spray paint fucking big a on Tucker Carlson's driveway.

Speaker 1:          02:59:25       We mean, well, if I think about who the great danger is, is that Alex Jones, uh, you know, who veers towards tin foil hat land with some frequency, or is it the people who were selling, you know, weapons of mass destruction in Iraq as a response to nine slash 11 or you know, the people, let's assume that you're a reasonable person on immigration, you neither think that borders should be opened or closed. Um, then you start hearing professors say, you know, the great thing about immigration is that it has absolutely no costs and all of them are better than all of our people because, uh, you know, they're highly trained, they're highly motivated, they're young. You're thinking like, okay, what kind of thing has all benefits and no costs. You're not, you're not even entering into rational description and now we're hearing like all these trade deals that got negotiated.

Speaker 1:          03:00:17       Yeah, that Kinda wasn't true. All those things that we were telling you that if you, if you question these things, you are backward protectionist and you were just, you were stuck in the old world and you couldn't embrace the new. Yeah, that was all bullshit. Um, what I think is we have a crisis and expertise, institutional expertise, uh, is at an all time low. Nobody really trusts any of our institutions to be an authoritative source of ground truth. It's not to say that everything that the institution say is wrong or everything the experts say is wrong, far from it. It's just that there are almost no experts or institutions that aren't willing to distort facts in order to pursue institutional goals that does a giant issue. Right? Right. And so I don't actually want a diy platform, these people, but I do have the very strong sense, you know, when, when I, when Elon came on your show and Peter Teal, um, my friend and boss came on Dave Rubin show.

Speaker 1:          03:01:14       I thought that was quite a moment where this alternate network of distribution, which is not under centralized control, started to be seen as comparably powerful and important. And I think some of the noises that Tucker Carlson just made to Dave Ruben about, well, hey, you're doing this out of your garage and you have the freedom to do anything. I'm, I'm beholden to the structure in which I live word a very interesting place with respect to what is this thing, uh, this alternate distribution network for, for ideas that's unpolished by the institutions. And I think I've been convinced in the last two days that I need. This is advice that I got from you at the beginning. You said you need to start a podcast. I think I need to start a podcast and I think you need to start a podcast just to keep going on about the hop thing until people figured it out just about the hot thing, but we have to, we have to return to some kind of stable sanity that I'm positive that the institutions can't return us to because the, the institutional interests, uh, really have to do with the fact that certain kinds of growth on which they're predicated, their existence is predicated if evaporated.

Speaker 1:          03:02:30       So all of these institutions are extremely vulnerable to corruption at the moment. And the real revolution as I'm seeing it is that high agency individuals are out competing, traditional institutional structures, um, in terms of mind share and some of those high agency individuals are irresponsible, you know, they're like Milo types that are kind of trying to light things up and some of them are extremely responsible and some of them, you know, we'll do a few irresponsible things but will self correct. And this new world that is being born is a huge check on the institutions, but it's still largely separate. Like, am I right that you don't do a lot of network television? Oh yeah. Anymore. But I used to. I mean that's how I became famous in the first place. Right. You know? Um, but yeah, I don't do it anymore, but it's also because there's nothing fun out there like this.

Speaker 1:          03:03:24       Like there's no place for this. Right. Other than this, this is the only place you could do this, but isn't it interesting to you that we still have not like Jordan had to be dealt with by the mainstream because the book was too big. His affect was too large. I think his effect on the Internet is bigger than the book. Yeah. Think the, the youtube videos and the debates that he has. The one that I was telling you, the recent one interview with Gq, so interesting. It's really good. The woman's very smart, but she gets trounced and it's because he's been

Speaker 3:          03:03:58       in the trenches with this stuff for a long time. I mean he, he's, he's fighting a very strange fight of dialogue and have interpretation of discussion and, and the freedom of intellectual sovereignty. You know, there's a lot of people that want you to think a very certain way and use certain words and say certain things and it doesn't matter whether or not you are in fact racist or sexist or homophobic or whatever. There's a weird battle of control going on that it's a heart of it as much as it is a battle of inclusion and diversity and strengthening our overall progressive mindset. There's a little bit of that too, but there's also an undeniable game that's being played and people want to win their scores. They're being scored. There's points on the board that throwing in new agents, they have teams going at it and whenever Jordan goes on one of these conversations, these video interviews and as a feminist and Jordan Peterson like, there's a fucking game going on.

Speaker 3:          03:04:58       We're watching a soccer match. We're watching a wrestling match. This is Jujitsu there. They're playing intellectual Jujitsu and Jordan's really good at tapping people. He's really good at and they get pissed. They keep sending in new chicks. They said that Kathy Newman Lady, and she's like, so what you're saying is that didn't work. Either. She just got devastated. She got rocked and this is what's happening over and over and over again because whether you appreciate what he's saying or not, he has some facts that are undeniable. He has some positions that are based on a rich understanding of history and of Marxism and communism and have a lot of the problems with people with compelled thoughts. If you're compelling people to behave a certain way, compelling people to talk a certain way, and we're not talking about compelling people to not commit crimes or violence. We're talking about weird things like compelled

Speaker 1:          03:05:53       pronouns and so if I take, if I take your analogy because you brought it up that he's like doing Jujitsu, so in some previous era I thought your description of the early days of mma was fascinating that we just didn't know what fighting was, so we didn't know who would win or what systems worked and if you think about the mainstream media is like a to some system that maybe has some valid validity in some very rarefied context and it comes into general purpose fighting systems and it's. It's dismantled very quickly. So now we have this weird situation that we've got this new world of kind of rule laden. Anything goes discussions more or less and the mainstream world doesn't want. Like the Akita world doesn't want to acknowledge that this weird ufc type thing is happening. How long does that go on for? It goes on for as long as it takes. And this is

Speaker 2:          03:06:56       similar to I think, the what's happening intellectually, and this is one of the reasons why I don't think you should stop people from expressing these bad ideas, is one thing for stopping people to say, hey, we need to kill black people. Stopping people said we need to kill white people. We need to kill. Fill in the blank. Whatever the group is. Yeah, that's, that's different. You're, you're, you're clearly stepping outside of the realm of civilization and into war and violence. And we could all collectively decide and we should all collectively decide we should have ethics together. Like whether it's right or left or in the middle, we should all decide, hey, you can't do that because what you're doing is you're calling for violence against someone who's not committing any violent. Can I pause you right there because I think there's a really interesting point.

Speaker 2:          03:07:38       Let's assume that we know that that behavior needs to be downregulated in some way. You can try to silence the person where we just physically duct tape them so they can't say anything, right? You know, we put them in jail. Uh, we don't give them access to the media, et Cetera, et Cetera, um, or we can shame them or we can kind of take them aside at what layer of this sort of communication stack to very good question. We should. Because I think one of the things that we haven't done this to positively say we agree with you that the speech is offensive and it is potentially dangerous, but we think it should be downregulated differently than the D platforming option. Well, the D platforming option, the real issue is there's only a few different avenues for these people to express themselves publicly. Right? And the, the argument that's really strange is should these be regulated like a utility or should they be thought of as private businesses get to decide what's on their channel essentially, like it's almost like a, a, a, a private NBC that everyone can broadcast out if it's none of the above.

Speaker 2:          03:08:44       What if the problem is we're trying to pretend, is it like a dinner party, is that the public square? Is that the utility? And it's none of these things. I think these ideas, what I was discussing that like there's, there's a reason why good ideas and bad ideas should go to war is the same reason why even though I kind of knew that most Kung Fu was bullshit before the UFC. I want those guys to get in there and try, oh, you got some death touch. Hey, come on in. I want to introduce you to a guy, you know, this is a, his name's Cain Velasquez and you're going to try your death touch and now he's just going to wrestle to the ground and beat your fucking brains in. Okay. But that's not going to happen because you know, death touch, but good luck and you let them duke it out and that is the, that's what it is. But it is a little. No, no, no, but, but when you deep platform people, that's when it's not angry with you. But what I'm trying to get at is that it is. I hadn't really thought about it the extent to which Jordan is the only one of us that they've really gone after like this. Well, he's, first of all, he became famous from this, right?

Speaker 3:          03:09:54       This is the battle was wha, how he emerged. He emerged from this battle over the use of compelled pronouns for, um, various genders like the bread 78 different genders. Similar but not okay. The difference is Brett's position. He comes from a different place, the way they were going at him with so much more than reasonable. They were saying right away that what he has to do is leave work because he's white. They were basically saying a racist thing and everyone universally acknowledged as racist, except for the super lefties who thought that it made sense because in their mind, every white person is somehow or another guilty of at least at the very least using your privilege to advance in the world at the, uh, to the negative impact of people of color and people of other ethnicities. So they decided that they are going to have a day of exclusion and instead of this day of absence having black people and people of color stay home, they were going to kick white people out.

Speaker 3:          03:11:07       So it became an aggressive act instead of an act of appreciation, it became, uh, an act of punishment or an act of exclusion and by people that are clearly out of their fucking mind. That was also part of the problem is their, their arguments were incoherent. You'd see that fucking stupid president of the university standing in front of those kids and they told him to put his hands down because he was threatening their, you're, you're scaring us. You're making violent gestures with your hands. So he puts his hands down and they start laughing. This is nonsense. Now you're in little kids. You got little kids running lord of the flies on a grand scale in a state university. And it's all. I mean, this is a public university, right? Yup. I mean they get funding, right? This is all chaos. Nobody agrees. They got baseball bats.

Speaker 3:          03:11:49       They're looking for him. If he's coming back to the school, the kids form these vigilante groups with weapons over what? Like who's threatening you? Like what is happening? You need weapons. But the big story there was the non reporting. What do you mean? Well, the New York Times, Washington Post, all of these major organs, NPR, they didn't report. They didn't want to touch the story. Well, this is what this is. My big theory here is that every outfit that has a a grand narrative cannot report the news that goes counter narrative, so racism by blacks against whites cannot be reported by any outfit that believes that racism is impossible by blacks against whites, that such a preposterous position. The idea that racism is exclusive to any group will, but the redefinition of definition, the redefinition could suck a fat dick. It's a stupid redefinition. That's true. This idea that the only way you can be racist as if you have power over that other group. That's nonsense. Every human beings act as individuals and they always have power over each other. You have

Speaker 1:          03:12:51       power to intimidate, you have power to isolate. You have power. If there's more using about this is that there is no pretense of consistency. I mean, on that side of the aisle, it's like we're going to throw out the following 17 completely contradictory rules and then we'll tell you which rule is operative in any given moment. So, you know, I was going to throw out this concept of the Hilbert problems for social justice. So one of them is, um, you cannot understand me because my experience is too different and you must understand me because mine is so important, right? Or, um, we're all similar enough that any deviation from 50 slash 50 shows you the amount of sexism in a workforce and we are all so different that once you include women, uh, in previously male occupations, you will see a great benefit because of the diversity of opinion.

Speaker 1:          03:13:44       Once he saw all these self-contradictory couplets that you have to agree to. Well, that's the weird thing is who assumed that I just buy all of your stuff. I think we've made a terrible tactical error. We fought these bad ideas rather than saying maybe we should just accept all of your bad ideas and then show you what kind of a weird world. Yes. No, no, no, no. You can't do that because they don't make sense. You can't say, oh yeah, they make sense. Men, how do I know when you're serious? Well, but that's my. Just let those through and does things fail. But that's my point is that by showing the internal, this is in mathematics. We call this reductio ad absurdum that once you take on too many different points, you show the conflicts showing that those things can't all be true. There's no way in which if I accept all of your ideas, I can run anything.

Speaker 1:          03:14:38       So, you know, take this thing about a trans exclusion from Victoria secret, right? You didn't hear about this. Oh God. So the idea is that the Victoria secret lingerie division head had to step down, um, where there was a scandal in the background that somebody had said we don't actually want a trans people walking the Victoria secret runway. Right? And so very interesting. You have a company that is dedicated to the commercial exploitation of humans as sexual objects for the privilege of the male gaze. And now you're angry that it doesn't include trans into that exploited class. So just without, without getting into whether this makes good economic sense or anything, there's just the issue of self contradiction, but isn't that a reductionist view of what Victoria secrets is? Isn't it possible that a woman can feel empowered and sexy if she's wearing lingerie and it's not just to the exploiting of the male gaze that they, that she appreciates looking attractive.

Speaker 1:          03:15:39       Wonderful. So take that off. Okay. Right. Exactly. So the idea is that you're both going to say I'm a, that that's a positive female empowerment issue and it's a terrible male expectation as you at the same time, terrible male exploitation issue. Like what if a guy likes what if women decide universally, they like guys who wear leopard skin underwear and guidestar wearing leopard skin tidy whitey underwear. Well this is sexual selection but, but yes, but, but it's the difference between that and women wearing lingerie. If women wear lingerie and they do it because they like to be an interesting stat and they liked to be more try, that's what they're to accentuate their attracts. So then the sexual self objectification is an interesting issue. Is that an issue of empowerment or is an issue of oppression? It could certainly be. Well, that's what if a woman's health to take that, take that all on.

Speaker 1:          03:16:26       Why does it have to be exploitation though? That's the question, but what I'm trying to say is you've t some point. You've made too many arguments. There's this concept called the principle of explosion in mathematics. The principle of explosion says if you can get one contradiction through airport security, you can blow up the universe as soon as you allow a single contradiction in the unity of knowledge, everything can be proven right, so everything becomes meaningless. So the game in some sense in mathematics is frequently to say, well, let's take all of those beautiful things that you believe. So you've just created some done seated. Some throw them all in. Instead of saying what's true and what isn't true, you say, are these compatible? And these ideas are clearly incompatible. So for example, one of the tricks that I use is to look at advertising for women to women and what phrases get used.

Speaker 1:          03:17:19       So if you used the phrase turn heads the summer in quotes and put it into a search engine, you'll find all sorts of revealing outfits that are intended to court the male gaze. You say, well maybe that's not really the male gaze. So then you put in a phrase like make him drool and that will be used to market to women. And so this issue about can we at least get to a point where we're talking about the internal contradictions of your position? Like I, I don't even want to get into what my position is. The first thing that's scaring me is that you've said so many things so strongly and so dogmatically, and this doesn't have to be about gender. It could be about race, it could be about class, but when once you've said too many things, then I can say, look, I don't see any way of squaring all of your positions and it's not.

Speaker 1:          03:18:08       It doesn't even have to do with me. I think that's where we haven't gone to yet. So you think letting them come up with as many preposterous things as possible. And then once it gets to a position where they, the, the idea's contradicted each other, expose that. Well, that's my point, which is once you've told me all of your principals, then I'm going to say, great, I'm confused. Do you feel that I have to understand you or that I can't understand you because I don't know which is operative in this situation. Tell me the rule how I decide which principle that you've stated governed this situation. Right? So if. Go ahead. One

Speaker 2:          03:18:48       last point about that. I don't want to have to refer to you where you say, well, you bring, you bring me each individual situation and I will tell you which principals operative in which principals inoperative that doesn't work. I want you to list your principles, enlist your mechanisms for resolving the conflicts within your principles. And then once you've done that, we can actually evaluate what you're saying. But at the moment it requires you as an oracle to tell me which of your many contradict your seemingly contradictory positions is operative in every particular case. So for example, we did that one with the person who was the quantum, uh, ex Muslim, trans, trans, you know, everything going on, which is operative, the person with mckayla phobia, which is a extremely rare psychological condition, or the person who appears to be a deep into some self, uh, you know, some radical self actualization principal or even a person who wears that crazy makeup should be able to wear whatever they want.

Speaker 2:          03:19:54       It's nothing wrong with it. You should be able to dress like Paul Stanley from kiss, if that's your, to assume that that's true. But what if, for example, as a heterosexual male, you don't want to watch, um, uh, the crying game at the Victoria secret runway show. Do you think that, wait a minute, do you really think that Victoria secret runway shows for the heterosexual male in some sense? Yes. What guys, has he ever watched a Victoria secrets? That's what the guy said. He said it was a, he's branding it as. No, no, no. I mean, there's something between a fantasy of Victoria secrets. A senior executive recently told that trans models don't belong in the fantasy of Victoria secret's fashion show. Well, you know, that's, that's on him, you know, I mean he wants to be the. But just because he said it doesn't mean it's true.

Speaker 2:          03:20:45       I guess if you looked at the graph of male to female viewers have a Victoria secrets. I have no idea. It would be like a few prepubescent boys and the vast majority of women and maybe some gay guys, but that's it. Is that right? It's got to be without fuck is sitting around with on honor an hour. What are you doing? Oh, again, some popcorn ready for the Victoria's secret fashion show. Dogs coming over and Mike and we're going to drill to TV thought fuck Outta here is porn and then there's everything else. Everything else is for chicks. Okay. Runway Shit. I don't know the single guy out there watching runway shit. It's like, remember when playboy had play girl? That was her gay gay dudes. Not for chicks. Right? They don't want to see that and we don't want to see runways. We're not.

Speaker 2:          03:21:29       We're not here for runways. We get bored easy bunch of chicks walking around in their underwear. I think you're calling it very. You may be right about who the audience is. I have no idea on the demographics. I've never watched one of these in my life, but it's not the case that I believe that male, the male gaze is nowhere to be found here because it's a very weird thing that the female is largely buying a an amplifier for something that is supposed to excite a male, but it's. It's a little bit to me like the female is the magician buying magic supplies at a store for the audience. Right? Sure, sure. That's a good way of looking at it. I don't think there's. The male gaze is absent. I just don't buy his interpretation at that. It's a fantasy for men. It's ruined with Trans men or trans women.

Speaker 2:          03:22:17       I don't. I don't have. I don't have a dog in that fight. Seems silly. It seems silly. It's like if you don't want transgender people to be in there, you just have to say you can't say. It ruins the fantasy. He just say, I will only hiring people that have vaginas, I don't know, do whatever you want. Like you can. Like there's certain jobs if you go to Chippendale's, like our trans women shown up, trans men, are they at chippendales where they're down there because they don't have a dick and but they're all jacked and they looked like a man is just what women want to see and are they transphobic if they don't want to see that. If women go to a, you know, one of those all mail review shows and it's all trans men, but they're heterosexual and they're not really into trans man.

Speaker 2:          03:22:57       Are they all phobic? Yeah. So what I'm trying to get at is there's a hierarchy, like I'm not that interested in this, in the particulars of Victoria's secret's profitability and what their statements are. What I'm more interested in is you've cut, you've annunciated so many. There's so many different principles at work as to what should govern in a conflict that you won't tell me. Well, okay. When these two things, these two beautiful things that you've said actually lie in conflict, how do you resolve the conflicts and it seems to be, well, why don't you consult us on every single one of these and we'll tell you a case by case and that can't work because what I want to know is I don't want to appoint you as an oracle. I want you to state what your positions are. I want you to state how you harmonize them and then we're having a conversation, but as long as I have to keep going to you and your crazy definitions and you're well, this is operative on, on Alternate Tuesdays, then it doesn't work.

Speaker 2:          03:23:57       I completely see your point. However, you can't give ground. You can't give grounded nonsense because that ground was never get back. You never getting it back. If you allow them to establish certain ridiculous principles, rules that are contradictory to each other, they'll come up with a reason why they make sense. No, no, no. You don't allow them to put it into the workforce. You say, look, before we put it into the workforce, let's just understand the 17 different things that you've said. Are absolutes. Well, you're basically doing then what Jordan does and every single one of these debates, you letting people lay out their idea and then you shoot them down and you decide what's. What's logical and what's illogical. I think that's. That's the UFC of ideas and this is why it's important to let these shitty ideas into the match. Why do we still have so much caught up in the Akita League

Speaker 1:          03:24:44       in the country?

Speaker 3:          03:24:46       Because it sounds good. People liked the idea that you don't have to learn much. You could just go in there with a death touch. Fuck people up. They don't want to think that all you have to practice for 10,000 hours. You have to sprawl and work on your leg kicks and working with this public shaming is death touch well, debating these. I think honestly, and I'm not trying to blow Air Jordan's horn anymore than I already have, but I think what he does is very important because he is one of the few that engages in these people, in these very public forums, in these long form debates where they go to war with ideas and these are way better their conversations because because he's fucking good at it, they want to chop them to not picking you so much because I'm friendly. I'm not as like, I'm not as combative as he is, so I send them also not as smart as he is and I'm also not as. I'm not, I don't have credentials. I don't have the credentials that he has. Like when he is the University of Toronto professor, a Phd, when he's going to war with these people, they're, they're throwing out valiant warriors to die at his sword. What did you hear? What to watch?

Speaker 1:          03:25:50       Bread and Richard Dawkins. Cargo. So what happened? They appeared on the stage for the first time. They oppose each other. Oh yeah. Really? On religion. Oh, well, it's Dawkins now. Religious? No, no, no. Dawkins is staunchly in that a sort of new atheists, aggressive guys. I panic because I know you had a stroke. Oh, okay guys. You know what I'm saying? I thought your brother was an atheist as well, but Brett doesn't think that religion is a virus. It's not Paris. He believes that religion is actually an adaptation and the weird thing was is he said, look, there's young Dawkins and there's old dock and young Dawkins came up with these two powerful ideas. The idea that the meme, the unit of ideation a is a, is a gene like object. He also came up with the idea of the extended phenotype. So when you talked about that ant mound that you were excavating, that ant mound is in some sense part of the and strategy.

Speaker 1:          03:26:50       It's such a. it's so deeply tied in that you have to consider the ant mound is part of the ant system because it can't exist without that complicated underground city. Right? Right. And so what he said was, okay, if I use these two concepts, that memes are like genes and the genes can throw off a bad meme instantly. So genes, memes have to ride on a gene and they can't parasitize it too much, and you also have this inclusive fitness, which is, that may be religions co travel with us and allow us to outcompete those who don't have them because they seem to be found everywhere.

Speaker 3:          03:27:29       So prevalent. Right? You have to, if you looked at it objectively, not looked at it in terms of you know, how you feel about cult like behavior and people's susceptibility to influence. If you just looked

Speaker 2:          03:27:42       at it objectively, if you were from another dementia and you'd go, well, clearly this is a part of being a successful person. Tell me about it. Exactly. So Brett, Brett and Dawkins met, and I think Dawkins had this kind of reaction like, Oh crap, I'm meeting an ultra Darwinist who's read my work, taking it seriously and is feeding it back in and saying, you, you, Richard Dawkins, in your younger years, established ideas. Who, when that, when those ideas, logical consequences or explored, it completely negates your late life hatred for religion because it reveals it to be an adaptation rather than a pair of citizen action of the human species. You know what? The real problem that I've always had with Dawkins and his take on religion is not that he's wrong or they're right, it's his anger that he has when he's talking to people that believe, yeah, he, he, he sets, he sets up the kind of like heavy conflict that, you know, the way people interact with each other, right is very.

Speaker 2:          03:28:45       The reactions are very dependent upon the attitude that a person has when they go into this interaction, you know, with two people meet on the street, one person, the one person meets that person says the same words and they wind up hugging. Another person meets that person and has a fistfight. Like what? What is, what's the difference? Well, there's a lot of it is the way you approach people a lot of is the way you accept people's ideas, the way you communicate with them, the way you allow them to fully express themselves without judgment. And he doesn't, he doesn't buy any of that. He feels like there's a war going on and he's got to shut down religion as quickly as possible. That's the thing he wanted to.

Speaker 2:          03:29:24       He wanted to fashion a science into a cudgel that was maximally efficient for beating the crap out of religion. That's a great way to put it. And what Brett did is to say, actually your scientific work goes in the exact opposite direction. The reason I brought it up was it was one of these unexpected occurrences that when you have a meeting of these things, and this is your point about the UFC, is that the mixed martial arts thing was, hey, we don't know what's going to work. We don't know what's going to have. Nobody knows anything yet. And gradually we came to understand that there were certain systems that were hyper effective and that even those could get, um, you know, you were making the point earlier about Brazilian Jujitsu didn't keep advancing, uh, at the same level once we understood the role of all of these different systems and advancing fighting.

Speaker 2:          03:30:13       So the question that I'm having repeatedly is what kept Brett and Dawkins, for example, from having that meeting, um, where I think dawkins probably didn't fully understand what he was getting into when he agreed to appear within evolutionary theorist on stage. But you don't, you think that he's just very confident in his ideas. He's very confident, his intellectual capabilities, he's been doing these types of debates and shutting down these secular or these people that are from various religions. Right. I mean, from, he's, he's had these debates with people from Judaism, from Christianity. He has been as part of his career. Right? Yeah. I mean, and even what the fuck's his name? Uh, the Indian fellow who, uh, everybody makes fun of, what the Fuck's his name? Dinesh D'souza? No, the other guy, the one, the, the quantum guy. That's always using that guy, that guy, that guy is constantly using inappropriate quantum words, throws quantum into fucking vegetable soup and tries to make it to make sense.

Speaker 2:          03:31:16       He, he used a lot of word salad, you know, and um, I mean, I've seen him debate him too. Yeah. But you liked these videos of the fake martial arts guys and they, they, they show up for the challenge because they've actually bought it. Same with Dupo Depok. Well, this is what I'm trying to trying to get at. Isn't it interesting that in general, the people who say, you know, immigration is a pure good. There is no connection between Islam and terror. The only people who oppose a free trader, protectionist. These people know enough not to want to trounce us because what they're saying is wrong. Right? And they're expert enough to know that they are, they've got a secret five point exploding heart technique or something and then they know it's nonsense and so they won't actually think they do. Well then why don't, why don't they want in?

Speaker 2:          03:32:12       Um, I don't think they, I don't think they necessarily do actually believe that they're wrong. I do think that some of these people that are like super progressive and very, very committed to some of these maybe illogical positions on some of these ideas are afraid of conflict though. And I think that's one of the reasons why they shy towards progressivism towards socialism. I don't think they let conflict. Some of them. No, no, no, no. They like to get together and scream at people. This is what they'd like to get, get, get together in large groups. Say We know how you sleep, you fucking racist you fucking piece of shit, but one on one. They're cowards it like this is, this is the type of person that would think it's a good idea to, to show up and bang on someone's door and scare them in their home.

Speaker 2:          03:32:58       That type of person is not the type of person that would, that looks forward to on an even battlefield engaging someone one on one and just just open communication. That's not what they're dealing with. They're doing is trying to silence people, scare people, intimidate people. They're bullies, intellectual bullies. People are bullies are almost always insecure. They're almost always scared. So this is why there's been very few people that are jumping forward to, to try to go to intellectual war. When Rachel maddow or um, Linda Sarsour one in. I mean, they're pretty. You're dealing with two very different types of human beings. So Rachel Maddow, it's one thing. Linda Sarsour is a very, very seriously

Speaker 3:          03:33:38       religious person who's got some, you know, very deep beliefs as far as Islam. She wears the hijab or she'd been just as two totally different.

Speaker 1:          03:33:47       No, but it. But if I listed a group of people like the late night comedians, there's this very weird thing that they all seem to believe the same. Like there was a secret meeting that they all agreed to a bunch of stuff that I, I, I want to see the conference proceedings. Like what's, how so? Well, just that they all kind of know that the Republicans are, are all horrible. The Democrats are basically good people, that they, they all know that climate science is settled science. I mean, there's some that they have these pretty much open borders are a great thing and that everybody who doesn't believe in that is only so it's only not believing it because of xenophobia, whatever these set of beliefs are. I don't see these guys in open discussion particularly, you know, two hours long. Well, I don't think it's a. That could, could you get a Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers in here and have a discussion. My guest is really. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          03:34:47       I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure they'd be solid. They're scared of having discussions with people, but I only see them in ovarian. They'd have to be very measured because they could lose their job. That's not, it's not that simple. They make a tremendous amount of money. Right? If they came and said, uh, anything that could be misconstrued or misinterpreted, even not even actually being something that's actually transphobic or homophobic or actually xenophobic, if they said anything that could be taken out of context and put it in a small clip and then sent down and it goes viral and they're done. Look at Megan Kelly. Megan Kelly had a question about why can't you wear makeup to look like Diana Ross? Why can't you? Well, there's some good reasons why you can't. There's some good racial history behind blackface. However, why is it that she can't even ask a question without losing her job?

Speaker 3:          03:35:42       Like that's it pulled up blog Kute. We have to make a fucking statement. We have bore violence, but for exactly what you said about, about the whole Kung Fu thing, that is only can exist in a protected context. Well, first of all, someone like Megan Kelly can only exist in a protected contest with all these people protected contest. Even Cole bear is got to be one of the fastest minds on the planet that everybody I know who's smart, who's done his show says he just thinks faster than you do. Well, I'm sure he's a very smart guy, but. But he's also a Catholic devout. Yeah. Yeah. That. Does this bother me. It bothers me. It doesn't bother me as an organization of kid fuckers. Well, well how come he's not speaking out against all those kids getting fucked? Well, if you're a Catholic, like I was raised Catholic, I mean I'm not saying that he is, I'm not saying that the people, he knows our, but this is a giant

Speaker 2:          03:36:36       problem with that organization, but. But that's not what's bothering me. What's not bothered with what I want to make sure that we're talking. I think we're about to talk past each other, so I want to bring it back. Okay. I think you just gave me an answer. He can't appear in this kind of a context because that might come up

Speaker 2:          03:36:58       and he, he needs to be in a world with much more restricted rules where someone can't say it's an organization of kid fucker. That's right. Yeah. And it's not just more restricted world that that's the reason why that has been able to survive. That's what I'm trying to get that people don't talk about, but is the idea that this is such a risk. Like your point about Akita was if you happen to be unarmed and attacked by a man with a sword, this might have some value. It would have some value of someone that attacked you in a very specific way. It didn't understand what the key. So the idea is that that's a very restricted rule set on which to fight. Right. So now maybe what you just said to me, which could open this whole thing up, is that all of these people can only apply their ability to have a back and forth of ideas if the rules are heavily restricted.

Speaker 2:          03:37:50       I don't necessarily think that's the case. I think they could do it in other ways. I think all of them are operating under this rule system because this rule system is how they get paid. But I think Seth Meyers a very smart guy. I know Jimmy Kimmel, he's a very smart guy. They can do whatever they want. He could do a podcast. He could do anything. He could operate into any in any genre I believe. And I think I would imagine the same with [inaudible] I, I mean I think Jimmy Fallon st thing, but when they're forced into that box and this is 100 million dollar a year box, you know, it feels good and that box was fucking velvet walls and you get to drive a fat Mercedes and live in Beverly Hills. Dude, did you decide to stay in that box? Maybe their mind is in that box. Maybe they on a regular basis, maybe there's not any restriction for them at all because this is how they operate all the time.

Speaker 2:          03:38:38       So I did the show with a Jordan and Ben Shapiro on Dave's a set right before Ben Wind on real time with Bill Maher. And Ben was kind of excited to do bill Maher and said, oh, I don't think he's going to rough me up. I think he's going to be a gentleman. I think he's one of us. And then when ben sat down with bill, we saw this thing that was very. We were sort of hoping because bill is kind of the most towards us, if anybody in that kind of mainstream environment. And what I saw, which I hadn't really appreciated, was that bill was not doing this kind of open discussion thing. A lot of his tone was leading like surely you're not going to say that. Know. It wasn't just purely saying are you saying that it was all of this emotional instruction? Yes. And it was clear to me that when I saw Ben on that in that context, that there were only a few hours separating the two appearances and that the characteristics of that environment and we're builds show is the most like this show, that it's just too different.

Speaker 2:          03:39:48       It's not, it's not really the same ecosystem. And you couldn't have an open debate unless it cuts off after seven minutes and the host is in control. Well bill doesn't have any time that well, this is part of the problem. Part of the terms of they have a very restricted format. He was doing a conversation with Steve Bannon and he was on Sam Harris' podcast and he was talking about it and he said that one of the problems was he got to this point where like I was wanting to ask him more stuff, but I ran out of time and I heard that. I was like, what the fuck kind of ancient system are you operating under that you run out of time, but let's take. Let's take him at his word. Well, he definitely did run out of time, but I assume that that's true and so that Bill Maher said, hey guys, I want to.

Speaker 2:          03:40:27       I want the following situation. I want to continue to do realtime in the same format that it's always been done, but I want to have a podcast like Rogan where we take as much time as we need and I don't think those two things play together. Oh, they're fine together. Yeah. I feared that the, that they're not. Well, here's the thing. He went on Sam's podcast and I've. I enjoyed him more than I enjoy him on the show. I know because he had chances didn't look the same way on Dave Rubin show though. He looked totally different. How do I didn't say it? Oh my God, you got to see it. Um, you know, Tucker, uh, you know, I'm having my own weird issues where I used to, my previous position was that Fox News is just propaganda and that Tucker was in that old car, a crossfire situation way back when Tucker was like opening up as a different person saying you have the freedom.

Speaker 2:          03:41:17       You're the new. I'm still stuck in the old. Well, he must really feel that. You must really feel like he is like, look, that is what you have to do if you want to survive on Fox News. And again, it's a velvet coffin. You're in there, it's beautiful. Yes, you're getting paid shit. Loads of money, but you don't necessarily have the freedom to express. First of all, you don't have long form freedom, right? And you don't have the freedom to completely express yourself across the border. Like you could. You can't look at the left's ideas and say, you know what? I really liked the idea of universal healthcare. I really liked the idea of universal basic income. I really liked the idea of paying for people's school job. I think you and I actually have a really interesting difference of opinion. I think your opinion is there is nothing preventing you from staying in the velvet coffin and doing this style of podcast.

Speaker 2:          03:42:05       And my guest is. I'm not saying that. I'm only saying that with Bill Maher. I think Tucker Carlson probably can't do that. I think of Tucker Carlson left colby or do it. Yes. I don't think so. I think he could. I don't think he would though. I think he out of all of them and I think he's brilliant and don't get me wrong. I'm what I said he's from, uh, an organization of kid fuckers. Uh, it's not him. I mean, but he's a part of the cabinet you could do. You could do any one of these people. They're all bright. Do you think is a big thing? It's a big thing

Speaker 3:          03:42:32       in terms of, first of all, the actual reality of the organization and what they've done to protect people that have molested children. It's unprecedented, right? It's also something that I was raised in. I was Catholic. I went to Catholic school. I don't think that he wants to do that sort of wild country open type Internet show. I think he enjoys wearing a tie and doing a straight up talk show like the Johnny Carson show or the Jay Leno show and I think he's a very, very good at it and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think a lot of people like that France and I understand that, but I think that's him. I might be wrong. I'm just assuming I could do different of what a what an action that if you tried to do both of these things, you will be revealed. You'd be caught between two worlds where if I see what you're saying, like I actually think that a lot of these ideas would collapse just the way Kung Fu collapsed. I think you're probably right. I think if you had two people having these conversations in long form, instead of those CNN, a three windows where they're just battling it out for six minutes and then you know, everybody's yelling over everybody. That is the single worst way to argue ideas. I think there's no gracie challenge. There's not. Well Jordan Peterson is kind of doing his own grave challenge that because gender. Yeah. And he's the only one they want. Yes. Well, which is, which is I think a puzzle hoists Gracie of the intellectual.

Speaker 3:          03:44:05       He's out there tapping wrestlers. Um, yeah. I mean I think I'm not legitimately now he's worked his way past the Kung Fu people and he's now onto like a Olympic wrestlers, like they're throwing at him this, this latest one was very good. She is much better than Kathy Newman lady. She didn't make any of these ridiculous Straw man arguments. She, she came at him with her positions and our points. It was interesting. I think what you're saying is true for everybody except Bill Maher. I think Bill Maher would hold his positions in podcast form and I think he would just have more time to expand on them and I base this on him being on Sam Harris, his show and I find it to be very good. It was the 10th anniversary of religious and he was excellent on that. I think he could do it, but I think he's also.

Speaker 3:          03:44:53       He can say, fuck you. He got in trouble for dropping in n bomb on his show in a joking for him. I mean he's a different cat. The whole thing is very different with him. He's on Hbo, but when Ice Cube came to him and said, you can't do that. It was painful to me because I'm just positive that he had a Carlin style attitude about that word. That's tough because in this environment, again, that's where he makes his living. He butters his bread over at HBO and if you wanted to have a long form conversation with that guy even on a podcast and he didn't have an hbo show, that's one thing, but if you do have an hbo show, you have to have a totally different attitude. One

Speaker 2:          03:45:30       wrong. You're walking a tightrope, but this is what I'm trying to get at is is that we're too dangerous in some sense to play with because the velvet he's. He's asked to. I've talked to bill and I actually went back and forth on an email about something. I dropped the ball, but no, he would do anybody's podcasts. I don't think that's the case. He could do his own podcast as well. I agree that he would be the one most likely to be able to do both. He could do it. Yeah, he could do it. I think all of them could do it. I think Seth Meyers could do it too. I think Jimmy Kimmel could probably do it as good or better than any of them. Jimmy absolutely could do it. I mean, the only thing that's holding him back, he's a man of his ideas. He's not gonna.

Speaker 2:          03:46:10       He's probably the least likely to alter or manipulate his ideas of anybody that's ever done one of those late night talk show host. He's just operating inside a format where you don't swear and you have a certain amount of time and you try to be funny and you say insightful stuff, but he's a very ethical guy and he's also a very, very smart guy and he's also very rich. He's got a shitload of fuck you money and I think Jimmy Kimmel do it easily. I think a lot of people could do it easily and I think they're going to have to. I think some some point along the line they're going to realize that the restrictions that they're operating under, unless they really enjoy that format, I don't think those formats are going to be there that long. I think those formats are a lot like sitcoms, like they're slowly starting to vanish.

Speaker 2:          03:46:51       You know, for every one the Roseanne show that comes up, which is kind of nostalgic and you know, that runs into its own disaster. How many new sitcoms are there that everybody's aware of? Shit. It used to be every time there was a new sitcom, whether it was friends or you know, fill in the blank, whatever the show Seinfeld there was. Everybody was talking about these new sitcoms. Nobody fucking talks about sitcoms anymore. This is the, this is the thing I took on this morning on twitter, which was a Dave Rubin and Bret Weinstein and myself were talking about this phenomena of very high follower counts with cycle low engagement. Oh yeah, that's fake. But those are fake followers. That's what that is. Well, it may be, but it's a lot of it. But it's very interesting that we're talking about getting rid of visible follower counts and getting rid of likes.

Speaker 2:          03:47:40       Who's saying that? Um, apparently there's discussion about a Jack May have floated some trial balloons that twitter is going to try to improve the level of conversation and by getting rid of follower counts and removing likes can imagine thinking you're going to improve the level of conversation by getting rid of a heart that you can switch it on someone's Id. Art, it's literally a heart, but it's feedback. You're clicking on a heart. It's on instagram and on twitter it's a heart. It's like, here's your little heart. I love you. I'm going to get rid of love Jack. Come on, Jack. Going to get rid of love, terrifying human being. Why? What? What's terrifying about it? Because I'm seeing you blowing kisses in my general direction. I'm remembering all the videos I've watched where you attack some sort of a punching bag with this vicious spinning elbow or something.

Speaker 2:          03:48:28       I'm just thinking like, okay, listen, we're talking about ideas here. You can't. No, I want to get out on that stuff later. I want to have a midlife crisis with some instruction for. I think we got to end this. We've done four hours and 10. Are you kidding me? I to show you what they said though. This was just a couple of weeks ago. We've been saying for awhile, we are rethinking everything about the service to ensure we are incentivizing healthy conversation that includes the like button. We are in the early stages of the work and have no plans to share right now and this is in response to telegraph the Telegraph saying twitter to remove the tool in a bid to improve the quality of debate. I think something really weird is going on. What is the quality of debate and by whose definition I mean, and you're not gonna you're.

Speaker 2:          03:49:13       You're definitely not going to change the way people interact with each other. You're just not. People interact with each other because they're anonymous. They have incentive to talk shit. It's fun. Okay, so the one thing I could ask you as we close this thing out is if we could plug. I'm not only my twitter, which is my main thing that I'm trying to diversify into instagram and youtube. Should I get shut off twitter? Are you worried about getting shut off? I'm always worried, but you don't say anything inflammatory like would you? You're very logical and reasonable guy, so you think it's really gotten to that point? Well, yeah. I'm actually worried that by being logical and reasonable, I have more of a risk because the things that I'm saying, like we're also recognizing intellectual and very left wing. Your progressive. So why would they shut you off?

Speaker 2:          03:50:00       Oh, I think because they're much more worried about a progressive. Who says that the current progressiveness is absolute stupidity. That's much more dangerous than some right winger. Who was always against anything that's progressive. Interesting. There's a war of foot. You love that kind of stuff. You'll have that cloak and dagger type Shit, don't you? Yeah. Well, I'm part of the ineffectual Dork with your stuff. I don't say ineffectual. I know you said international direct web. Yeah, that's what I call. Listen. I have to. I can't call myself a part of the dark web. That's just too ridiculous for a man in my position. Okay. We'll see what the. That to one of a thousand people that speak the humor across the lands. Listen, this is effortless. Yeah, I can do this. I did that. I had no idea it was four hours flew by. It was awesome. All right, well you can I just tell you, just give the, the, the names please do. All right. I think I am. It really is 5:10. She's Eric r Weinstein on. No, I'm Eric r Weinstein and twitter. I'm Eric Weinstein, Phd. I think on instagram and on my instagram. Uh, I linked to you on the Instagram, Eric r Weinstein, instagram, and I'm on Youtube. Eric Weinstein. Phd. Yeah. And if you can't find his instagram, I linked it on my instagram. All right Joe, thanks for having me with you, my friend. Lots of fun. Alright, bye. You fucks.
