Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Four, three, two, yes. Rob. Hello. What's up buddy? You look great man. You look super healthy. O' lakes when you're doing your mill. I know you're doing a lot of Jujitsu but you look leaner and I her and they took the pineal gland out of a small child and then implanted in me. Is that all you need to do? Pretty much judging. If that was the case, you'd people would run around with helmets on their kids illegal here. Yeah. So, uh, yeah. Where'd you go to get it done? I can't really divulge that. Oh cool. Cool. Yeah, we'll. Wherever it was. As long as he wasn't America. Right? Right. So, uh, you're, you're, you're balls deep in Jujitsu these days, man. Trying to. Trying to. Yeah, but you could see that in you. Like you look different. You really do. You look like when I was on here last time I was at the end of a pretty big travel cycle, like doing military gigs and stuff like that and that was pretty beat down and we've had two kids since, I think I was on the podcast and older that has beat me down to beat me down in a different way.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       So I've just been at home and I can train, don't travel as much. And so yeah, everything's been pretty good. I do this gymnastics bodies programming couple of days a week, a little bit of squatting, a little bit of dead lifting pretty on point with food and then just getting the dog Piss beat out of me at jets, like two to four days a week. So yeah. Yeah. What got you into that? Oh Man, I've always been interested in martial arts. Like as a kid I had a brown belt and like the Ed Parker Kenpo system. Old School. Yeah. Old Old School Elvis Presley style. Yes. And uh, and you know, like I knew that Parker had some connections with like Bruce Lee in jkd and I was really always really interested in that. So I went down to Long Beach, California and ended up tracking down some folks at the Inosanto Academy and, and sparred with a kid that had been doing tai boxing for like six months and he was 60 pounds lighter than I was, not particularly athletic.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       And he beat the crap out of me. I mean it was just like a man fighting a boy. Only I was bigger and stronger and faster and he just destroyed me. So I went back home and I burned my brown belt and I started studying some Thai boxing and it wasn't long after this that I encountered Brazilian Jujitsu for the first time and I had a little bit of a high school wrestling background and I was a state county, the California state power lifting champion. So strong athletic kid. And again, like this guy like submitted me 50 times in like two minutes. And I was just kinda blown away. But this was back in like [inaudible] 92 when, unless you were in a major metropolitan area, you just couldn't find Jujitsu, so I did a couple of weeks of it then you know, around like 92 93 and I didn't have a second Jujitsu session until like 2003 and again it was like a month or something because at that point the folks that we're usually running these schools, like they could barely keep 'em open. They were like 9:00 in the back of a karate school or something. Right. So it's only been the past couple of years that I've been able to be pretty consistent. So you just found a great gym out where you were at? Yeah, yeah. I've kind of bounced around a little bit. Kelly farrel, conviction, martial arts, and then also the gorilla Jujitsu affiliate there in Reno. And then I get out to Elko to the guys that a straight blast gym in Elko under Chris Meyer.

Speaker 2:          00:03:12       So you out in the Reno area? Yeah. Yeah. I didn't know what Rena was like. I went to Reno this past August and went, I've maybe had passed through once when I was younger, but we went through reno into the mountains in Nevada. It's fucking beautiful.

Speaker 1:          00:03:26       It is. It is, yeah. It's four seasons. Like the summer's great winter was really cool this year. Good snowboarding and all that.

Speaker 2:          00:03:33       So it looks like a Colorado up there, like, do you think Nevada you think desert, you think barren landscape? Not Very pretty or pretty in those sort of a like, hey, you better bring water sort of a way. It wasn't like that at all. It was gorgeous. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       Yeah. Um, it's kind of funny when people, you know, like if I'm being interviewed or something too, like you live in Reno really? Is that part of a parole violation or something that I really liked it. The thing that is sad though is the casinos in Reno, they're weird. It's, it's a really weird mix because you have like Tesla and all these tech companies that have moved into town and it's really got this new vibe going on. Yeah, like the big tesla mega plant is out there kind of east of town, so you've got this kind of technology scene, there's a whole startup row in downtown Reno and then you have the casinos and that whole underbelly element to it. And so these two things are like literally, you know, you change corners downtown and you're in either the lake super depressing, you know, like failed at the casino deal or you go around the corner and there's a bunch of guys with the technology startups, technology startups will overwhelm the shitty casinos.

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       I still, you know, like tech in general and this is maybe getting off in the weeds, but there's so much stuff that's just been built on speculation and eyeballs and nothing real that I'm still curious if like tech in general is going to make it. So yeah. It's uh, how so in what way do you know, you know, there was so much speculative money that went into that scene and the, you know, there's only a few entities like facebook and Google and stuff that have really turned it into a money making venture. And a lot of these technology startups, there was a lot of money going into them, but it was just kind of predicated on growth or eyeballs, but they never really had a strategy towards profitability. And so I'm just kinda curious how many of these things are really gonna gonna make the cut. But it could be really good to like if we, if that stuff tightens up and people really start looking at it like a legitimate business and not just eyeballs and bandwidth. So it'll be interesting. Yeah. I've always thought that was weird about twitter. The twitter

Speaker 2:          00:05:40       has so many users and has so much. There's so much activity, there's something going on there. Right. But then they have to figure out how do you generate money from that. Right, right. Yeah. It's worth a lot of money, but for no reason. Right. It's like God, everybody's using it. Yeah. But what do you do with it right

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       now? But I feel like someone's going to figure it out, but I felt like that two years ago. Right. You know? Yeah. They stay open. I have no idea. I have no idea. Like, uh, yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I keep hearing that I'm on a shadow banned list. You heard of that? I don't believe it. I think it's horseshit. We have Jordan Peterson on, so that probably got you on some sort of a short latest. I've got a bunch of people on Gavin McInnes is more egregious probably and more ridiculous. And uh, Steven Crowder, Alex Jones is the biggest one for sure. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:06:31       Did you see what the list like means like what it means to be on that list? No, not exactly. Like you just get your tweets reviewed by a person before they make it out to your feet or something like that out of here. Really? Is that real? That's what it said. I don't know if it's real, but that's what it said

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       most of my tweets and make it out there and the ones that don't. Thank you. Thank you for cut those off because it was some kind of oversight. I'm hammered at the comedy store at 2:00 in the morning. I want to rile people up for no reason. So yeah, thank you for protecting me from myself. I'm kidding. I'm not in any way advocating censorship and I don't, I'm not, I'm not necessarily sure. I believe it either. Sorry about that. Deviation of. Not at all. Not at all. Yeah. So I've been following your instagram feed and uh, you and your wife have been doing some crazy blood sugar tests after foods, postcard meals, like beans and a bunch of other different high carb foods. What are you trying to do there? Are you on a Keto diet or what are you doing? I generally run really well.

Speaker 1:          00:07:28       Quito or pretty close to it. I'm fueling Jujitsu is a little rough with that. So I maybe do about 75 to 100 grams of carbs on harder training days. And then other days it's pretty low carb. My wife though is kind of like Wolverine, like you just can't kill her. And this is some of the stuff that I've learned in the past couple of years, this personalized nutrition where there's a huge variation from person to person and how they respond to carbohydrates, foods in general, but in particular carbohydrates. There was a study done at the Weizmann Institute in Israel a couple of years ago and they basically put a continuous glucometer on folks. It's a little disk that you pop on the back of your arm. They did a full genetic screen on them, a gut microbiome test, and then they started feeding these folks different meals and the blood glucose responses were all over the place.

Speaker 1:          00:08:14       Like one person would eat rice and they would have a barely perceptible blood glucose increase and another person would be near diabetic from, from beating that Rice. And do they believe this is a genetic variability? Is that location like where their genetic ancestors and gut microbiome seem to drive it? And so if the gut is unhealthy, then that seems to make your blood sugar response worse. And then conversely, if you eat in a way that makes your blood glucose response look pretty good, then the gut microbiome seems to shift towards what they consider to be a healthier profile. Huh. So now is there anything you can do to your Gut biome to change the glucose profile? Yes. Um, what exactly what to do is pretty complex. Like, you know, some people can have a condition called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth where the bacteria are basically growing too far north in the gut essentially.

Speaker 1:          00:09:07       And then whenever you eat something with carbs in it, it makes those bacteria grow in an inappropriate place in inappropriate way. And it's Kinda difficult to basically starve the bacteria in the fore gut and then feed the bacteria in the hind gut. And there are some, some, yeah, Chris Kresser on like, he's one of the best people in the world probably in dealing with stuff like that. But it's, um, uh, I'll put it like this in the last five years, we've learned more about the gut microbiome than we knew in the previous 50 years. And like literally every month that goes by we will learn more and more and more. But the clinical application of doing something to help somebody that's sick is not easy. It's a pretty complex process. A lot of people will experience a lot of improvement from just kind of a low carb diet, but it doesn't work for everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       Like they may a lot of people may need like some herbal interventions like a garlic in and different antimicrobial agents that help to knock that bacterial overgrowth back. And it's a, it's a pretty challenging process. Particularly if the person is really sick. Does fasting have any effect on it? It can. It can just like reduced meal frequency seems to improve the gut microbiome and in the overall gut health. So this is some of the stuff that I think is going on with intermittent fasting where instead of eating like six or seven meals a day and just constantly kind of keeping the gut inflamed instead doing maybe one or two meals a day. Pretty broad spacing seems to have some great benefits for folks. I've been doing that thing where you only eat for 10 hours a day. Yeah, yeah. I did a podcast with Dr Rhonda Patrick.

Speaker 1:          00:10:43       She was explaining it to me and I said, let me give it a try and I've had some really great results. I lost a lot of body fat almost immediately. I started losing body fat from it, but didn't lose any energy and don't feel great. I mean, it just, everything feels really good. But uh, it's been, it's challenging because I would come home from shows like late at night and I'd be hungry. Right. And I'm supposed to be drinking water, like, you know, he was supposed to have anything that your body has to metabolize, right? Yeah. Even coffee will kind of cause a little bit of a adrenal response. The liver kicks out some glucose and then it basically presses the reset. But what about herbal tea? I would think that that would probably be okay, but I mean, the folks that really know a lot about it, like Rhonda Patrick Valter, Longo, they're really pretty adamant that in that fasting period, like just wanting nothing but water.

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       Yeah. Yeah. Water is delicious when you thirsty, but not so good for the rest of the time. You're like, oh, it's boring ass. Well, that's why I grabbed one of these guys are real. He is. Yeah. Via for people don't know is not a sponsor. It's just we drink it and it's Stevia flavored soda, so it's really like a guilt free soda. Right? Which is crazy. Like soda that's sweetened with plants, right? And not sweetened in a way that affects your blood glucose level at all. Stevia can reduce blood glucose, so in some people, because the sweet taste, they actually release insulin in response to Israeli. Can you grab a couple of those gems and then bit thirsty, but the downside is that if you have somebody that has kind of an insulin roller coaster can actually make that problem worse. So the Stevie is super good.

Speaker 1:          00:12:15       I think it's a lot better than most artificial sweeteners, but there are folks that can kind of get themselves into a bad spot with it. That's interesting. I did not know. That's a. So is it? Is there like a recommended daily allowance of Stevia? No. Again, this is just a really individualistic thing, you know, and it's something that like if somebody is a health coach or a doctor or healthcare provider and they see somebody that's struggling with something and then they're like, okay, so how are you eating? Like I'm eating low carb. Okay. So are you doing any, uh, artificial sweeteners or what have you, and if they're doing something like this then it could be something that is kind of kicking them out of the, the, you know, the insulin regulation that would work better for them. Hmm. Now what do you think about colonics related?

Speaker 1:          00:13:04       No, no, but because I feel like it was a thing for awhile. A lot of people were talking about cleaning out their intestinal tract and you know, you just got to get water up there and flush everything out and they, people would like literally watch the tube and go low. I know what you're eating. And I'm like, what? It always seemed odd to me. That seems like there's generally an exit only kind of process and so yeah. Yeah. It. Unless you're trying to do certain drugs, right? Right. Certain drugs apparently are best when you stick them up there, but there's a girl named neuro soup, I don't know if she's on youtube anymore, but she had this whole detailed story about a dmt trip that she did was she took dmt upper butt and went on like some five hour journey into the Netherworld because it goes directly into your bloodstream from there, right?

Speaker 1:          00:13:54       Yeah. It's that base. And so you've got a [inaudible] deal to like with your hand that base kind of an asshole or talking about you making that hand signal. But I always wondered if it was good for you. I'm like, I just feel like you should leave that area. Like flooding water up there just doesn't seem like the smartest move. Yeah, it seems like just skipping a meal here and there and just kind of letting it do its natural business seems like a pretty good thing. The people that I encountered that did clonics, they seem to be on kind of a merry go round with it. And they also were into some other really squirrely, stopped like it, uh, like healing, healing and shock rose in it. Um, it's just seemed like they were always moving towards something and never really getting there and so it just seemed odd, like there was never like a resolution to the situation and I kind of like having some endpoints and then move on and do something else.

Speaker 1:          00:14:48       I always get very curious of something or very sort of, I guess skeptical is the right word, but have something that doesn't have any research behind it. So that's why I wanted to know like how much research is there behind Kalanick because I don't, I never hear about any. I've never dug into it. So I honestly don't know. I do know that there have been some studies looking at the gut microbiome, like when they do a, uh, a colonoscopy, so they'll, they'll kind of flush it out and they'll give you some stuff to move everything out. And there is some research that suggests that's not great for the gut micro or for the, the lower gut microbiome that there's actually some pathological changes from that. So going in and getting a colonoscopy and all of the like strafed bombing that they do to move everything out may not be that great. It's a great way to put it. Brave thinking about fighter plane. Totally. Agent Orange.

Speaker 1:          00:15:42       Um, well I know that people that have antibiotics that like people that are battering battling staph infection have a horrendous time sort of reconstructing their gut biome. And Rhonda Patrick detailed that on one of the podcasts that we did, she had a tremendous, a staph infection and it route it wouldn't go away. And she actually wound up one of the things that really helped. It was a topical application of garlic. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which is really interesting. Yeah. A garlic Oregano. There's a lot of these traditional oil Oregano oil and like the Oregano oil and the garlic are really potent in general. They kind of spare the healthy bacteria are what we would call the more beneficial bacteria, but even that's not a universal story. Like it can suppress some of the more beneficial bacteria in some situations. So again, this is where if you think you've got something going on, it's probably smart to work with somebody that knows a little bit about what they're doing so that you've got a protocol, you can test it, see what the results are, and then we can make some decisions based off that because you could really, you know, if you're already in a compromised state and then you throw something like that in, you can end up worse.

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       Now, for people that are listening, who would someone go to, like say if you really wanted to get your gut biome checked out? I mean, someone like Chris Kresser, uh, there's a gal in Austin, Amy Myers, there's a Dr Ruscio up in the bay area. Chris Kresser also has a, uh, the Kresser Institute or re certifying healthcare practitioners. These are the folks that you want to check out. Also, the Institute of Functional Medicine is a really good place. Most of the doctors and healthcare providers that go through that functional medicine training are really well versed in looking at the, uh, this whole gut microbiome story. But he, interestingly, they kind of pull it back and they've got this kind of evolutionary biology picture that they look at, so they're thinking about sleep and your food and stress levels, social connectivity, and they really put all that stuff together in a pretty good way and they're not chasing symptoms are really trying to figure out root cause and then try to address that root cause and move forward and they're pretty.

Speaker 1:          00:17:45       They're pretty good at figuring out like you've got 18 things going, which, which is the one thing we need to address first and then we'll knock that out and go to the next one and the next one. And now when they start applying, say like probiotics are, there are all probiotics are created equal in terms of like foods, not in terms of like supplementation, because I know there's some really intense a probiotic supplements you can buy that you have to keep refrigerated right now. Again, there's huge variability in that. You have some people that when they add probiotics, like just like Kimchi or Sauerkraut, improve immediately liked their clinical symptoms improved. They feel better, maybe depressive symptoms improve. They get leaner and then you have other people that everything they have going on get to worse, and these are the folks that you start wondering if they have some small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

Speaker 1:          00:18:36       Do they add some reactivity? There's these things called fodmaps are fermentable carbohydrates that can, you know, make the gut microbiome kind of freak out and there's another layer to this which is called small intestinal fungal overgrowth. So there are people out there that have some sort of a persistent fungal infection which doesn't get picked up and the general gut microbiome screening because they're looking at bacteria and fungus. So this is a whole other layer to the story that people may have had a year's long decades long fungal infection in the gut that is then disordering everything causing inflammation and those are really, really difficult to deal with. What does one do when they have a fungal overgrowth? You can do some of the antifungals like Diflucan and and again some of the herbal preparations, but this is another layer, you know, kind of peeling the onion that there aren't that many practitioners that are even looking for that as an option and then the treatment protocols are not super well edited out.

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       So there's a lot of experimentation that happens there. Do they know what? Is there a dietary cause? I mean there's always an influence on the diet, but you know, you could, you know, refined carbohydrates makes all this stuff grow better and it disrupts the normal gut flora. It causes inflammation, but you know, oftentimes people will go on a round of antibiotics. The bacterial population gets pushed down and then the fungal population, which is always there, but usually it's in some sort of a symbiotic balance with the other microbes than the, the fungal infection or fungal population can increase. And this is where some people will go on a round of antibiotics and then they end up with some sort of a legitimate fungal infection. You know, like they can see it on their skin and the doctor will prescribe some antifungals for that, but you can also have this happening kind of a low grade sub acute level where it's not bad enough where they're getting rashes and hives, but it's bad enough that it's making them sick and not kind of optimized.

Speaker 1:          00:20:35       Wow. It's just so hard to figure out what's going on with you unless you. I mean it seems like for the average person that has a full time job and family and all that jazz, it's probably incredibly difficult to get to the bottom of what your health issue is. It definitely can be, you know, the average time for diagnosis of an autoimmune condition or something like celiac disease is like 12 to 15 years, so people are suffering. They're suffering for a long time and it's not the easiest thing in the world to pin down because the symptoms are so variable from person to person. Now if you go to a good doc, particularly someone, again kind of functional medicine training or they've got a little bit of this evolutionary biology perspective, they usually ask a set of questions and more questions so that they can kind of narrow down what's going on, but if you're kind of doing the doc in the box deal and you've got five minutes with this person, like they're just trying to figure out what's the script I'm going to write so I can move this person out and get to the next person.

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       Yeah, that's unfortunate and you're just not going to. Unless you get lucky, you're not going to figure out what the issue is. Yeah. It would seem that the amount of time required to figure out what's wrong with the person would also be very expensive and likely not covered by a whole lot of healthcare plans. Yeah, I mean it's interesting like some of these functional medicine docs do a lot with pretty little, you know, but some of what they're doing is a time investment. Like they'll do a two hour history and the. If they can get the information the last. So you know, what was your in utero environment like, like did your mom meet? Well, did they smoke when you were born? Was it a vaginal birth or csection? Were you breastfed or not? When was your, uh, the approximate age of your first round of antibiotics?

Speaker 1:          00:22:16       Did you ever go on tetracycline for extended period of time for acne? And so they'll build a really comprehensive early life history and then try to March this thing forward in the last few questions, like did you ever travel out of country? Did you get some sort of a gut bug while doing that? So there are some really important pieces but a well trained a practitioner will rely a lot on the intake and then that will kind of inform where they go with the testing. And so the testing might be a little bit expensive but you're not just casting around blindly. Like because of that really thorough intake and kind of understanding the early life history and trying to fair it out. If there's ever been like a big event that could be linked back to this health crisis, then they can really dial in the testing. Then depending on what they get from that, they can make a treatment protocol.

Speaker 1:          00:23:06       Try the treatment protocol. If we have success, then good to go. If not, then we start modifying from there. When you say eating foods out of the country and catching some sort of a bacterial infection out of that, that is one of the scariest things in the world to me because I've watched that stupid show too many times. Right. What are the enemy within or something like that. Yeah. It's hard to think of your body as being like not just an organism but a whole ecosystem. Right. Right. And, and stuff can come in and take up residence in new. Didn't really want it. Yeah. I had grd at twice. Oh really? And it's um, it's bad. It's bad news that uh, the first time I snorkeling and Mexico.

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       Oh Jesus. And so everybody in the main snorkeling group was kind of out in the salt water and then there was nobody over in this other area. And so I was like, I'll swim over here. But apparently there was a, it was an estuary, like there was a salt water, fresh water interface. And so I started swimming in the fresh water and then they were like, yeah, you're really not supposed to swim in there because this water out of a c no tay. And like sometimes what's the c note to the, uh, the underground. I'm kind of fresh water springs that come out of a limestone. I interrupted you when you were saying people take Thompson out water dumping the water. Yeah. Oh boy. Yeah, yeah. I know you get the Rda from beaver poop. That is another place. Yeah. And I don't know that there are beaver in the Yucatan, but there's some other carriers in Prince of Wales island once about a year and a half ago, two years ago, and it's really high up and it's above the line where beavers are.

Speaker 4:          00:24:38       And so you could take a water bottle and dip it into a lake and just drink it out of the lake and you feel it's so dangerous feeling, but they assured us they like, you can absolutely drink right out of that lake. Oh Man. That gives me a little gut rumblings even thinking about it. And we had a float plane land on that very lake. And I'm like, what are the things leaking in the leg? I'm drinking diesel water. And they're like, there's millions of gallons of water. And it's like, whatever. This is not going to affect you. I'm like, it says it says you. What if I scoop it right where the thing dropped off? It's diesel fuel. I don't know, but it just seems weird that you can do that. And then it seems even weirder when you think about the fact that you can't do that everywhere that most.

Speaker 4:          00:25:17       Even though we're a giant percentage of us as water really can't drink most water rate. My professor Loren Cordain, the guy who kind of founded this Paleo Diet concept, he used to be a lifeguard at Lake Tahoe, you know, 30 years ago, 35 years ago, and they would jump off the pier, dive down where it was super deep, really cold, open up their water bottle, fill it up, swing back up, drink it, and you can't do it now because the lake has ge already in it and a bunch of other weird things that happened. Well for him, nothing, nothing would happen to the lake. More people moving in and just, you know, it's just kind of a volume of poor input at some point. Kind of overwhelms the natural. We suck. We fucking ruined everything. Damn people. I mean, most, most indigenous cultures were savvy to the idea that you didn't take a dump and your own water systems.

Speaker 4:          00:26:08       So yeah. Well they knew about parasites for sure. I mean that was always a whole idea about not eating pigs. All the religious. Excuse me, all the religious rules about not eating pigs was a big part of it was because pigs eat almost everything. Right? Everything that's on the ground and they would eat something that has chicken gnosis in it. People would get really, really sick from eating pigs. So they had sort of determined that pigs were evil, right in shellfish. Similar. Good friend of mine, John Durant did a book called the Paleo Manifesto and he actually has a really interesting background, has kind of a pretty deep kind of religious studies

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       background and he would talk about some of these food prohibitions in different religions and then what we know about it today. And so things like shellfish. You ever once while we get something like red tide or you know, the diatom overgrowth and these are filter feeders would pull all this stuff in and then get loaded up with a toxin and it would kill you if you ate it. And so these food prohibitions really had some pretty good wisdom to them in general. But then there's also super goofy things, but it's pretty common across all cultures. Like people would, you know, kind of build into their systems, these prohibitions against different foods. And oftentimes because of this, uh, kind of bacterial or, or a parasitic deal, I wonder what, like the kosher ones for like and meat, milk and meat together. You can't have milk meet together.

Speaker 1:          00:27:33       I wonder what that's about. I would have to ask him about that. I, I never heard anything about that. And then it's interesting in Islam than there's not that prohibition. So. And I don't know if that was just kind of like a fuck you to the Judeo Christian deal or what? Yeah. Now what about eating fats with complex carbohydrates or fats with sugars? Um, does that affect your, your glucose levels like, and how it's absorbed by the body? Yes. But again, like from person to person, it really varies a lot. So for some people, you know, if you did something like a white potato and you're going to have a certain blood glucose response from it and you put a good whack of butter or olive oil or something in it, for one group of people, it would actually reduce or spread out the total glucose load.

Speaker 1:          00:28:20       So your blood sugar wouldn't go is high. Your total insulin load would be lesser as a consequence and then there are other groups of folks that they will see an increase in blood glucose response and a really pronounced increase in insulin response and is the the amount of fats that are in like the olive oil and the butter that's in the potato is a uniform or they're measuring it very carefully to the studies that had been done. They're quite uniform. Yeah, like to get in and do a pretty good job, so they're, you know, person needs x amount of carbohydrate, they add x amount of fat there kind of standardized for body weight so that you're diluting the glucose about the same amount from person to person. And so the. The best understanding that I've seen out of this is just that there's a pretty good variability from person to person as to how they're gonna respond to that.

Speaker 1:          00:29:08       So it's not always a case where adding fat to a decently dense carbohydrate source is going to buy you anything. For some people it is an improvement and for other people it's actually more of a problem. So you'd almost have to do like kind of experienced the experiments that you're doing with your wife, where you take the blood levels post, what are you doing, like what time periods. So you do it for the recommendation and it's called the seven day Carb, tested you 50 grams of carbs and that's the net carb. So all the fiber subtracted out and so if you're doing something like black beans, it's a huge pile of beans because have a lot of protein and fiber. So those things are hard to do. Something white rice, White Rice or you know like gluten free bread or something would be a lot easier to do, but you consume that.

Speaker 1:          00:29:50       You set your timer for when you're done with the meal. Two hours later you check your blood glucose and for my methods I'd like to see that two hour mark probably under 150 milligrams per deciliter for folks, which is pretty conservative. But when we look at again, some a pre agricultural people, they tend to have some really, Really Nice Blood Glucose responses. And again, from this weitzman paper, what we saw from that is if people control their blood glucose effectively, over time the inflammation drops, their gut microbiome improves. And so you could have two people that have a very different response to say like rice or potatoes or something. And one person like my wife, it's kind of crazy. Like she can just crush this stuff and she does great. And interestingly she can eat a ketogenic diet and do great. Like she just Kinda, she can switch whatever fuels she wants to, she does fine with that.

Speaker 1:          00:30:42       But if we keep that Gut microbiome or the blood glucose response pretty consistently good than even someone like me that kind of like pulled the genetic short card in the lottery. Like I don't, I don't know exactly what is wrong with me, but I don't handle carbs that well. Um, if I eat in a way that my blood glucose response looks like my wife, that my blood lipids look good and my gut is healthier. Like everything else pulls into a good spot. So even if you're not, um, you know, from that genetically talented side of things, if you can make your blood glucose response look like that genetically talented person, then you should get most of the metabolic benefits. You don't have as much latitude in your day to day eating. But I mean, you, you know, not everybody can flatfoot dunk a basketball or something, so you just have to take what you get.

Speaker 1:          00:31:30       Yeah. That's interesting. So you just have to kind of figure out what it is that your body requires. And the main goal is staying inside these parameters. Right? Right. And you know, it's, it's a tough thing for someone like me. You like I love the Paleo Diet, I love that basic concept and I don't. In general, if you throw out the following, would you say most people should eat whole unprocessed foods? Not a lot of contention there, you know, but when you get a little bit granular with that whole unprocessed foods, could be beans, it could be potatoes, sweet potatoes. And for me it's interesting like lentils, I do great width, I can do a lot of lentils, do a decent amount of carbohydrate from lentils. My Blood Glucose response is great if I do rice, white potatoes, sweet potatoes are better. But you know, the rice and white potatoes, I looked like a diabetic after eating that stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:32:20       So, um, you know, even though that general recommendation of eat whole unprocessed foods is generally spot on, there's still a lot of details and granularity in that, you know, you could be following a whole food diet and for you, because of your genetics or epigenetics, like your gut or maybe taking antibiotics in the past, you still may need to be really careful about the amounts and types of carbohydrates that you eat. That's crazy. Taking antibiotics in the past can affect you that far in the future. Like how, how much of an effect like time wise. So there's two levels to this in my opinion. The one level is the gut microbiome. There's another level to it. Certain antibiotics, the way that they work, they interrupt the transcription and in activity of the ribosomes in bacteria. But our mitochondria are effectively a bacteria, like they have bacterial DNA in ribosomes and even though in general, like mainstream medicine says that antibiotics don't effect mitochondrial function.

Speaker 1:          00:33:22       There's some pretty good papers that suggest that antibiotics can disrupt and damage mitochondrial function. And when your Mitochondria gets sick, you die. Like this is so much of what Rhonda Patrick Talks about with, you know, the benefits of fasting and having really good micro nutrient density and whatnot. And you know what Tim Ferriss pinged me a question about why is lyme disease has gotten so much worse for people, you know, use to. It was kind of like catching a cold, you know, a lived in upstate New York. Everybody seemed to get it. It wasn't something that would cripple people over the long haul. And now you're seeing a lot of longterm problems. But my question was, is it really the lyme disease or is it the damage to the Mitochondria from being on antibiotics longterm? Because the lyme disease requires a really long treatment protocol with antibiotics. That's fascinating.

Speaker 1:          00:34:11       But isn't it even worse for people that go misdiagnosed? And so they don't get on the antibiotics for a long time and the lyme disease gets deep, deep, deep into their system. Yeah. I honestly, I don't know much on that side. I've been looking so much at this kind of mitochondrial dysfunction side. I can't really comment much on like the longterm untreated lyme disease. Lyme disease is a scary thing because there's so many ticks that have it now. I was talking to some people this weekend and they were like, yeah, my mom's got it. My Dad's got it. I got it. You know, how many Goddamn people are getting lit up by these ticks and catching this little freaky disease. And where was it 20, 30 years ago, you know, it's funny. Npr just had a piece on this and it was, uh, some of the modern farming practices has killed off the predators that would normally knock the tick population down.

Speaker 1:          00:35:00       Like what I, I forget, you know, I, I literally just kind of scanned it, but uh, somebody that commented on, they're like, oh yeah, this is why we have free range chickens on her property to basically keep the tick population down. But part of what is suppressing that is that the free range chickens are eating mice and stuff. So the mice are a vector that allows the ticks to, to grow and populate. So the, you know, I just scanned this thing, but it was, it was interesting, but it was suggesting that the kind of mono cropping process of what we've done with modern agriculture has created this gap where we now have pes like Mammalian pest, like mice and moles that

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       are a vector for the ticks. And so they've just got more surface area, more more uh, uh, real estate that they can live on. And so their population has grown. That's a really important factor for people that don't like coyotes. Like there's a lot of people that are very angry that coyote coyote ate my dog. Like I understand. And it is terrible. However, the coyote, he also eats every rat, right? You can find, and that's one of the reasons why rats aren't everywhere. And if you go to New York City, you see very few coyotes and I'll fuck load of rats. And what would you rather have? I think I'd rather have a few coyotes every now and then the occasional loss cat then fucking black plague running through your neighborhood in the suburbs. It's true. But uh, they have eaten three of my cats in Reno, so I do smoke a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:36:20       How do you get them archery or with a suppressed rifle? Awhile. Doors. Do you know that when you kill coyotes you actually increased the population? Yeah. It's no head off and yeah, I, I know, but that's the reason why there's coyotes in every single state. And we have a podcast coming up with a guy named Dan Flores who, uh, wrote a book called Coyote America that I read. It's fucking amazing. But coyotes, when they yell out what they're doing, all that stuff is, they're doing roll call and they all chime in. And when one is missing, it triggers a response in the female to produce more cubs. Interesting. So in healthy conditions, when they're not being pressured, the female will produce like three or few cups. When they are being pressured, they'll produce like a dozen or more. It's crazy lake and spread out to change their area.

Speaker 2:          00:37:14       Humans will be long gone and coyotes and cockroaches will still be here. They will inherit the earth. Yeah. Well, it's also amazing how many native American myths and stories evolved, uh, about the coyote and about how the coyote was this sort of God that was kind of watching over everything and was responsible for creation and a lot of other things like really weird, freaky smart little animal is a wolf too, by the way. Yeah. So I, I had read some stuff about the Coi wolf where the wolf populations had been really pushed back and so they started crossbreeding with coyotes. And so now we're coyotes were maybe about like 25, 30 pounds now there'll be 70 or 80 pounds and they hunt in packs. And so they've got these characteristics of wolves and coyotes. And quite a few of them, but one of the things that's important is that coyotes, when a coyote and wolf breed, they're basically the same animal.

Speaker 2:          00:38:04       So even though there's variations in the way they behave, particularly in that, coyotes can hunt alone and they can hunt in packs. Whereas Wolf's almost exclusively hunt in packs. Right? The, um, they shared DNA. So the, when they have babies, they're viable. Right. So it's not like a hybrid. Right. They're basically the same animal. It's really weird. Yeah. Yeah. They're everywhere. They're apparently they're having a real issue with them in New York City. You have them in central park. They have them in Queens. Yeah. The urban areas are some of the most vibrant locations for the coyotes. Yeah. And I mean they just crush like, uh, the, the, uh, the pet population. Like you love your pets out at night. Like you're, it's Russian roulette with that. It is, it's even though the day man, I have chickens and I had one chicken, one of my chickens got stolen by a coyote and I watched him hop the fence with it in his mouth and I was like, wow.

Speaker 2:          00:38:54       It turned out her mouth. It turned out she was a female and she had cubs. Oh Wow. Yeah. And I was trying to figure out what to do. I just kind of let it alone. I was going to kill her. I was going to figure out a way to kill her, but then I thought, well if I kill her then the like part of it, I don't want the babies grow up and kill my chickens more. But then the other thing is I don't want to stop a mother from feeding. Right. I felt like I fucked up. Like I didn't secure the yard enough. It was my fault and there's a game being played in the game is stay alive and the chickens are playing away. Easier version of stay alive and the coyote is. So I felt like I had to give her that point.

Speaker 2:          00:39:29       Right. All right. You got that one on the board. Don't eat my fucking dog. I will. I'll kill you. All right. You know, that's, that's where it crosses the line. Like my, my appreciation, love for my chickens is, is a 1000th of my cat. You know what I mean? Right. So it's different. Yeah. Well my wife convinced me to get a Rhodesian ridgeback. Oh, those are the dog and he's a great dog. He's about 105 pounds and two percent body fat and I wouldn't want them getting mixed up in a pack of coyotes, but I think he could probably hold his own for a good bit if, if something went down sneaky though, one of them will come out and they'll like taunt them. Right. And then they'll chase them and then the other ones we'll ambush or like if the female lou the coyote is is a fertile at that point and either pumping out the pheromones in the lure or the dog away and they're like, yeah, you didn't get any action and we're gonna eat you a great story that this guy told me who worked at my pet food store and he also works as a nurse in a veterinary office and they brought this pit bull and it was one of those freak pitbulls that people breed and get it to like 120 pounds.

Speaker 2:          00:40:34       Have you ever seen those? There's A. There's a company called land of the giants and I think they're in Massachusetts and they make these pit bulls that look like bodybuilders. They don't even look real. Anyway, this guy had a pit bull like that and they brought it into the vet's office and it was just covered in massive cuts. It required something in the range of a thousand plus stitches all over its body. And they're like, what happened? He goes, I don't know. That dog got out of the yard. And he's just just covered insurance. They figured maybe it was a dog fight or something they didn't know, but there was just a trail of blood that lead from his house up into the hills where he found nine dead. Coyotes smokes. Yeah. So they just laid a trap for him and he just fucked him all up like a huge mistake.

Speaker 2:          00:41:22       And he brought this freak, this brock Lesnar pit bull into our midst. And he just mauled in. The whole family is gone now. Everyone's dead. He killed them all. He tore them apart, like in apparently they just kept fighting. I don't, I don't know what happened, but he said it was spread out, you know, the carnage was spread out over several yards. But, uh, this pit bull, just what town? Pimples or pop. I mean, they're just amazing animals. I mean, they are incredibly strong. That jaw power is just off the hook. They're really smart. So yeah, they're a. That would be a handful, especially if it's like 130 pounds. And Jack, the thing about the pit bull is that it's not worried about dying the way of coyotes. Coyotes, because no one's feeding them, their whole thing is like stay alive, survive, you know, attack and kill something, but don't fight to the death.

Speaker 2:          00:42:12       Right. Whereas a pit bull is essentially bred to fight to the death and the ones that didn't, they were removed from the breeding population, like the horrible truth of pit bull fighting is like that. Michael Vick story were the ones that would quit or the ones that would turn that wouldn't, wouldn't engage in the fight. They would kill them in torture comes horrible, horrible, horrible stuff. But because of that really nasty, cruel, vicious way of approaching the dog breeding, what they get is this bloodline of for warriors that just have no fear of death and when you get one, it's 120 pounds like that. Like fuck man. Right, right. What a giant mistake. I don't know if it 120 pounds, I might be making that number up is huge. Huge pit bull. I think they way they're supposed to run like 60 pounds I think at the upper end.

Speaker 2:          00:42:59       So when you start doubling that, that's a real fighter ones are 35 pounds. Okay. And when they fight them, they're small, right? Like when people have this idea of a pit bull in their eyes, they have this idea of a guard dog, but it's not really the ones that they fight. They're really not that big, but their physical muscles aren't that big because really it's all about having the endurance and having the gameness to attack and killed, pull up this website, land of the giants, land of the giants pit bulls. Because like a friend of my senate to me almost like, what the fuck is this? Like they've just figured out a way to do the same thing that the poultry industry has done, just breed bigger and bigger chickens until you have this fried chicken and can barely walk. Right. These guys have done that with pitbulls where it's just like, it looks like they're breeding it with something else, but it's really just maybe some Amazon, the puppy chow or something that would that work.

Speaker 2:          00:43:52       I wonder if people have done that, like, like inject steroids and guarantee somebody's done that. Yeah, sure. Right. Yeah, yeah. Pitbulls, uh, have an incredible bite, but what's really crazy is that a wolf is a bite that's five times stronger than a pit bull. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Both has a bite that's, I think it's 2,500 pounds per square inch versus 500 for the, for the pit bull. Look at that thing isn't quite the same one, but there's their bigs were giants and that size of these things. That is so ridiculous. A lot of dog that it's such a ridiculous dog. Did you see that land of the giants website? Did

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       you find it? I typed it in and just like a facebook page popped up. Oh really? I wonder forums asking about them, but they might've went under. I don't know. I don't know. Who knows? Yeah, it's really crazy that all these years

Speaker 4:          00:44:45       dogs, whether it's a Chihuahua or an English bulldog, all of them came from wolves. My, a four year old daughter asked me about that. She was like, dad had were all dogs from wolves and I'm like, yeah. And she's like, how does that work? And like I'm trying to explain genetics and genetic variability and everything and it was uh, it's um, if you could explain something to a kid then you've got a pretty good grasp on it. But I think that she kinda Kinda got the gist of it. The way I tried to explain it to someone was that it's kind of like people because people, you know, you have like bridge damages and then you get Shaquille o'neal, they're both people, right. But one of them obviously is a genetic disorder, but you could sort of breed for that genetic disorder. Right. And will the guy like Shaquille o'neal, me and Shaquille o'neal or in the same species, like how's that even possible, you know, like they look so different.

Speaker 4:          00:45:36       Right. And that sort of like dogs that we by preference and breeding and you know, and I guess geography as well, that's a huge factor as well. But. Right. But it is interesting like that. The Wolf coyotes, I guess like Dingoes, like there's a real uniformity there. Like nature ended up pushing some things where they've got this kind of Snotty Nis and they've got good hearing, a good smell, but not like a hound dog, which has better smell, you know, it's, it. It's interesting. And there's also an interesting genetic variability in terms of what kind of temperature their, their body has to be involved. Like for, um, certain mammals, when they grow farther north, they become much, much larger, right? Like white tailed deer in like Alberta can get to around 300 pounds. Whereas in Texas they're only like 100 pounds. Maybe 1:50 is like a big deer, you know, it's, it's fascinating that their body just decides that, look, the way, the best way to stay warm is to be enormous, right?

Speaker 4:          00:46:35       It's more round and shorter limbs. Sure. Stuff was like polar bears are some of the largest bears or Kodiak Alaska bears, which is sort of a perfect example because in Kodiak island, those brown bears have access to massive amounts of protein and salmon and beached whales and deer and bonds and things like that because they're just such a genetic. Uh, there's such a genetically powerful creature as is a brown bear, but then give them all this massive amounts of protein and incredible food. And then on top of that it's freezing fucking cold. So they just become these enormous behemoths. Right, right. Yeah. That's

Speaker 3:          00:47:15       came out about dinosaurs today. You were just talking about the dinosaurs are real, bro. Did you watch that podcast? It's not about that. It's a, that some. Sorry, some scientists did a bunch of research. He did like three years of research on himself or on his own. He said he went into museums and studying the bone fragments and uh, he put all of his information into a computer program and after five minutes it spit out something that said that, like all of the, uh, are the two major like dinosaur family, trees are different side of this little sun was up here is like what you thought. I said this is something like telling you that either cats or dogs or what you thought they were. And some of the animals you call cats are actually dogs. This is what I discovered.

Speaker 2:          00:47:54       Oh, that is sort of like, like, it's like that. Oh, okay. So for a dummy like me that doesn't know much about dinosaurs, theropods to all of them, the classic tree. Interesting. So what is it, what are they saying though? What,

Speaker 3:          00:48:05       um, were there from might be diff, like they stopped, this particular kind came from South America before and now it might have come from Norway. Dinosaurs came from New Orleans. Yeah. That's why one of the things that stay saying, so like this is one guy and at this news hit the waves today. It's like making big headlines all over about like what does this information mean? And uh, I was just thinking as you guys were saying that about wolves, that like what if they find out next week that all doug didn't come from a snake bite from cats or some shit like that.

Speaker 2:          00:48:33       Wow. Wow. How strange.

Speaker 3:          00:48:36       Yeah, it's super strange and their diets are a little different. They had some real small ones, had different kinds of teeth that proved that they were omnivores and not necessarily like carnivores are herbivores or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:48:47       That's a good lesson in like all science should have a sign hung on it that says good until further notice and you don't like turn it into religious doctrine and assume that it's 100 percent factual. You know, we create models and hopefully those models help us kind of predict and model the world. But you know, when you get better, newer information, you may have to scuttle that whole thing.

Speaker 2:          00:49:10       Yeah. There was an article that I tweeted and then a followup article earlier today or last night rather about a scientific journals about some scandals that are emerging from scientific journals or scientific journals are essentially operating on a pay to play basis. Some of them, they're publishing these things without really vetting the information that's inside the papers and ces. It just seems like anytime money gets involved and stuff, people become assholes. Sting, operation reveal sciences, insane. Fake news problem. I love the term fake news, right? Just such an anti intellectual. It's so anti intellectual, you know, like fake news. It's fake. Like when Donald Trump says that you are fake news, like, like how are you allow that? Like there should be a like a list of things that would disqualify you from being the president. Like as soon as you say that you're okay. Did you say that? Yeah. Okay. You got it. You got to step down, right? Can't. You can't call CNN fake news. Yeah. You are fake news. No, they are the news. You might think they're biased. You make thing that you might be able to point out some inaccuracies and make them make print a retraction, but yet calling them fake news like that. Just that term that anyone can use and it's such a small mouth noise to make news fake news and you say next. Yeah, next like Whoa, buddy settled. You're fucking with the entire process

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       that the district, because of your own power and the inconvenience of someone telling you challenging things, you're fucking with the entire process of getting information to people. Right? Like this. This last election cycle was really interesting. Like is it a man? I don't know. Like it would be. I think kind of cool to be 50 years down the road and look back at how all this plays out. I don't know that it's going to be great living through it. Like I have these thoughts that there's going to be like the Great North American States at some point, whether the, the s has like five different sub countries after some horrific thing goes down, but it people are so entrenched in the radiology and it's just, it's virtually impossible to get somebody on the opposite side of a fence. Avid discussion about anything in any meeting of the minds. And uh, it's interesting to me.

Speaker 4:          00:51:23       I really think social media is kind of facilitated this historical yet like print paper for, you know, maybe a couple of hundred years and people would have, you know, a community gatherings and they would talk about different topics. But that meeting in person and the potential of pissing somebody off and having them like try to beat you to death or vice versa. There is a certain civility that occurs with that. And within social media you get those same deep held beliefs. But then you don't have the ramification of somebody wanting to kick the shit out of you if you start upping the ante on something. And so like the, the discourse is just crazy, like there's just no discussion. There's no middle ground, there's no understanding in this. Let's last election cycle was really crazy and like it kind of broke me in some ways.

Speaker 4:          00:52:11       Like I, I, uh, am way less inclined to invest in much of anything now. Whereas before I would kind of bleed a little bit for some social causes and trying to, to put some thoughts out about something. But it was just kinda like, fuck it, I just don't care anymore. Well there are a lot of people that invest tremendous amount of time, a tremendous amount of time just engaging with people and fighting and arguing and insulting and attacking people online. And I have gone to a bunch of different twitter pages where I go, how many hours is this guy on? And then I check to see like when does he start his tweets? And then there's people that are tweeting 12 hours a day. Right? And it's all mean nasty attack shit. Like some mentally ill person has a computer and nothing is preventing them from just going after people and trolling people and attacking people. What disturbs me is not just that, but also this natural human tendency that we seem to have where you have an idea in your head and then that idea is not just an idea, but it's your idea and you have to defend that idea even if it's a preposterous idea, like the earth is flat. Right, and what you find out is that these people form groups and other people who have also sort of adopted this preposterous idea and refuse to look at all at any evidence at pointed. That's

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       a silly idea and instead they dig their heels in and get confirmation bias from all these other people. And then they formed these social media groups, facebook groups. They go to websites, they get on web forums and they start interacting with each other and exclusively interacted with each other. And then also in forcing each other's beliefs and, and great job, man. Good job of attacking those shells. Right? You know those. Like if you. Do you know if you think the earth is round, you are at globe hard. That's the newest. Jamie literally like cringed each took them. He had. I had to like step back. Blink his eyes. Yeah. You're a globe toward that. That whole thing is because these people, someone said something that someone went, well, people love to find the secrets they love. Like this dinosaur thing is cool because it seems to be real and you see the gal that said that all the fossils were basically people doing like kind of Michelangelo deal and Chiseling the matter rock because the fossils came out of rock. Oh you got you. And she actually what? She hasn't pretty nice boobs too. But yeah, maybe that's why people are listening, but just like, I've got a platform now you've got tits.

Speaker 2:          00:54:38       It's really good. I mean, so she's basically like, okay, so these things come out of rocks. So these anthropologists, because there's millions of dollars in anthropology or archeology there, just chiseling these bones out of rock and here we go to her

Speaker 5:          00:54:54       fossils that are found in the ground. What's that? You don't want to play games against dinosaurs. I wouldn't need to play some of us. Okay. I'm a little bit about the composition composition, what they end up being when everything is said and done. So, uh, fossil fossil piece of bone. So is actually a bone that was once in the ground that has been then filled with limestone, calcium and other kinds of stone link deposits over the course of many, many years left eyes out a patch of the day that ends up looking like, why is she doing that glass? What's your fucking hair out this big? And you say, okay, there's a bunch of fossils go. Okay, can you hand the rock off? Paleontologist paleontologist takes a little malate and they chip away at it and at some point they come out with something looking like a bomb and this is a problem.

Speaker 2:          00:56:00       Hold on. This is the problem. Just pause that. The problem is some fucking idiot. Like this gets to talk about a subject that she's not educated in and no one is over her shoulder. Got Eh, that's not true. That's not true. And here's the thing to people that, you know, someone out there who buys into a lot of the stupid shit, you must be an expert in something, you know, think about what you do for a living. You know, like this. Here's

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       a perfect example. Like some of someone tried to tell me that, like, a lot of these cheat touch martial arts guys are two deadly to fight in the UFC. And if they make a video, they make a video about this and I'm not there while they're making this video. So I can't talk to them like in stop them and pause them and go, nope, that's not true. Nope, that's not. Nope, that's not correct. No, no. Here's actually what happens when you get knocked out. No, it is not a fucking cheat discretion or dispersion technique. You're not really interrupting the shockers flow. No, it's a fucking concussion. Stupid. And we can measure concussions. We know about all the different variables in the blood. When you could prove it was actually. There's some new tests that I wanted to get into as well. Um, where they, um, there's an institute now that's checking concussions and they're checking, they're doing blood tests on people to find out about concussions that they've had in the past and how those concussions have healed.

Speaker 4:          00:57:19       Obviously I'm deviating from the path, but the point is I know a lot about martial arts, so if someone wants to do a video about martial arts while I'm an actual martial arts expert and I can talk to you about what you're saying, that's incorrect. I know about the history of it. I know what, what works and why it works. I know about Torque and leverage and all these different variables, but you could make a video with without me being there and you could ramble on or not even me in any martial arts expert and you could ramble on and if someone doesn't know, they watched and they go, wow, that guy dropping some truth bombs. Right? This is amazing. You know, I don't know if you saw this, but Matt Thornton, he's the founder, really brilliant guy, and they put together this. I forget who it was.

Speaker 4:          00:58:03       It's kind of a philosophy department and they put together this kind of white sheet on using Brazilian Jujitsu in particular as a means of teaching critical thinking to students because there's this really testable, verifiable process. Does it work or does it not work? And you can define what working means versus this kind of like, you know, cheat, didn't lock death touch type type stuff. And so they've actually developed this curriculum around using this physical process of Brazilian Jujitsu and I think also mixed martial arts in general, but specifically Jujitsu as a means of teaching critical thinking skills and said, I'll, I'll noodle on what like Kinda like the search terms for would be. But it's really interesting and it, it's um, it's something that I think helps pull this stuff together because you've got that kinesthetic element of people being able to feel, okay, you know, somebody gets mounted onto you, can you get them off? No, we'll look at this 100, 10 pound chick. She can dismount this person conditions using these techniques of leverage and balance and timing and all that stuff. And so then you can throw these things out about is this a verifiable process, yes or no? And it is. And so then you start laying the foundation of being able to create a good critical thinking process. One of the things that I really love about Brazilian Jujitsu in particular is

Speaker 2:          00:59:21       that it seems to be a study in variable absolutes, meaning that there's so many variables involved in like two people engaging with each other. Say if two people are blue belts and the engage with each other and one person dominates that person with superior technique and knowledge and gets the tap over and over again. You could take that same person who dominated that person and then put him in there with a guy leg Jacques Ra and he would just get manhandled and it would look like he knows virtually nothing about Jujitsu because some one person's the variables, the understanding of all the complexities of the techniques they have mastered them and they have also built their body to a much stronger physical unit. So all these are variables, but the absolute is getting the arm bar, getting the choke, putting someone to sleep with a choke, like those things are absolute.

Speaker 2:          01:00:14       It's like where you tap out if you're not just like a person who gets scared really quick and taps out for no reason which does happen, but you're thinking about someone who has some experience. When you're tapping out, you're essentially saying, you've got me into this absolute position. I'm, I'm, I'm at the point of death or massive injury. Knees tearing apart, arms breaking. So in doing those, you encounter these variable absolutes in a way that is really kind of uncommon in our world, outside of fucking car accidents and someone hitting you over the head with a baseball bat and you, you, you will encounter the consequences of actions and movements in a way that sort of makes you really appreciate the overall variables of life and how important it is to take care of your health. How important it is to know what you're talking about.

Speaker 2:          01:01:04       You know, if, if fighting. I was trying to talk about fighting is if it's a language and if one person has like one word, they yell at you and they're like really good at going, shut the fuck up. Like one expression like that might work with some people. It's not gonna work with someone who's got a really good grasp of the English language. Oh I should shut the fuck up and wash it. I shut the fuck up because you would like that. Why would you like that? Because you're too stupid to have a conversation about something you don't know you're talking about and that person's like, oh, it's really like drowning in which is the same way you'd feel of Damien Maia was on top of you trying to choke you. It's a lot like a language, like you don't have enough variables to respond to this particular thing and then there's also the strength factor and those other factors.

Speaker 2:          01:01:41       I think it teaches you critical thinking in a way that is almost unavailable outside of like war and like real physical trauma. Because the beautiful thing about Jujitsu is although you can get injured, most of it is pretty safe, right? Compared to boxing or kickboxing. Yeah. You've got a much more forgivable kind of margin of error on that. Yeah. Much more and I think the environment that it establishes, that it creates and the way that effect that it has on your mind, what's forcing you into these extreme problems, situations and solving those problems. Then understanding where that go wrong, what can I do to my body to maybe strengthen myself so that I can stop that from happening or maybe understand the position. So two steps ahead. I recognize that if I go left, I run into that and if I go right, I run into this, what I need to do is be patient, use my hips, hip escape, do this, do that.

Speaker 2:          01:02:37       And those, those variables and understanding those variables and having that, that database in your mind and recognizing that that is also, that's there's, there's analogies that you could make in all sorts of avenues in life that were, that would be greatly beneficial. Well, it and again, uh, just another hat tip to Matt Thornton, like he's just made this point that these, um, uh, alive art, whether it's wrestling or boxing or Thai boxing, Jujitsu, judo, um, there's kind of an authenticity with that because you really can't bullshit. It's kind of like, can you speak Spanish? Okay, well let's have a conversation in Spanish reading Spanish newspaper and tell me what was going on with it. Can you swim? You know, Sam Harris, I think he wrote that piece, you know, Jujitsu was like drowning for a non, for a non swimmer, looking at someone treading water, it looks inconsequential and you throw them in the water and they're going to die.

Speaker 2:          01:03:33       And so there's a real authenticity there that when you get in and do that compared to some of the fantasy martial arts where there is an assumption that just going through some sort of paces is going to get you somewhere and it doesn't necessarily mean that it does, you know? And so there's this whole great feedback loop and it crushes your ego and you have to really stay grounded if you're gonna maintain through that process, but it has so much value with every other facet of your life. You know, it's fascinating. Yeah. If you can keep from being injured, if you. Yeah. Yeah. And I think one of the things that really helped to keep from being injured is I think it's very critical to strengthen the body and I think there's a lot of people that don't like to do that. They just like to train.

Speaker 2:          01:04:14       And I was guilty of that for quite a while until I just mounted up a series of injuries that I almost couldn't deny it anymore, uh, particularly back injuries, but strengthening the body and sort of strengthening the overall structure in which you engage in these sorts of things. Meaning not just strengthening the body will by lifting weights and doing squats, but also by yoga also by doing really unusual exercise like kettlebell windmills and stuff like that. That really puts a very bizarre load on the spine and weird ways. And it's really strengthens the core in a substantial manner that allows you to deal with the pressure of certain positions without succumbing to the, you know, the, the, the attempt by your opponent. Right. You know, it's a, it's an interesting topic because you have someone like Marcello Garcia that he's like, I just roll and clearly that word is injured now.

Speaker 2:          01:05:07       He's, he's definitely, you can just roll, right? You definitely can do it. And if you're as until you can't. Yeah. It's technical as him. He also has weird genetics. Like if you look at Marcello's body, his legs look like a man who weighs 300 pounds. I mean he has cankles slack. Yeah. Yeah. Shannon cafs giant legs. And that's one of the reasons why he's so good at controlling the back is he's using his legs and smashing you. Huge legs. Well let me ask you about that. Like I've been a big fan again of kind of this straight blast gym stuff of you know, like non attribute based training, like how do you break that up? So like if you were flexible, are your explosive or, or what have you. How much of that do you rely on versus trying to develop this stuff where you've got a game that you could do, whether you're 40 years old or 80 years old, like how do you play back and forth with that to to, you know, optimize that process?

Speaker 2:          01:05:58       A real good question, and I think a good study is Roy Jones Jr and Roy Jones Jr in his prime was probably the most attribute based fighter of all time with substantial attributes. His speed and his style though the movement in which he used inside the ring was really very difficult for people to handle, but as soon as that went away, his physical attributes sorta started to deteriorate. His career declined substantially. He went from being the best in the world. Two years later, people wanted him to retire and he went from and there's a bunch of variables that could have happened in that fact. I think some manipulation of hormones we know, I'm just speculating, but I believe steroids are probably involved in him moving up from light heavyweight to heavyweight or a beat John Ruiz for the heavyweight title and was jacked at 200 pounds shredded and then went down and fought Antonio Tarver and looked listless and soft and didn't look as fast and I think a lot of that was his body responding to the fact that he, his hormone levels were off.

Speaker 2:          01:07:05       And I don't know if he was checking that stuff, but I bet he probably wasn't. I bet he just had lost too much weight and dehydrated himself too much. Getting down to that 175 pound limit again. So tarver knocked him out and then Glenn Johnson knocked him out after the fight and it was bad. Right. I think that, um, when Roy was in his prime though, he did some things that were so hard to handle, so unconventional because of his ridiculous speed. Like very rarely did he throw the jab instead, he would throw a lead hook and we throw a lead hook and it was as fast as a jab, but it would knock people to fuck out, right? You know, he would just, he would just, just good leap in on your plot and you see guys get hit and then boom, the right hand would be behind it.

Speaker 2:          01:07:46       He was so fucking fast. So when he was young, he beat Bernard Hopkins and he beat him pretty handily when he was older. Bernard Hopkins beat him, beat him pretty handily, and Bernard Hopkins was always older than him. So when he was young, Bernard Hopkins who had that very defensive based style, keeps his hands up very high, very technical, couldn't deal with the speed of Roy Jones Jr. He just was ridiculous. But as soon as roy lost a step and it's speed, tHen his style's not really the best style. The best style is the most technical style. And you can do that most technical style with extreme attributes, right? So I would agree with them that the best thing to learn is the proper way of learning all the techniques like learning good defensive posture, good, good, hands up when you're throwing strikes, good movement and footwork and not just relying on freak athleticism.

Speaker 2:          01:08:43       Think it's probably the best way to attack it. What do you think about the really grip dependent games? You know like all the, the spider guard and all that stuff. Like I see these guys doing really amazing stuff but it seems like their hands are broken and it pretty young age and I mean maybe that's something that you burn just to because you've got a competitive career and then you've got to kind of shift games. But then you have someone like crohn who really. He has an interesting, you know, open guard game where it's a lot of color control and stuff like that and he's not getting in and doing like spider garden inversions and whatnot. And you could argue is mayBe not as successful as a lot of other people in that. That really competitive circuit. But he also seems to be motoring along pretty well.

Speaker 2:          01:09:24       Reasonably injuRy free and still has a very powerful game. Well he is an incredibly powerful game. You also have to think, well his dad is the greatest jujitsu player time, so that had to play a factor, although it didn't really train much with his dad, which is kind of unusual. Um, he doesn't have the, he doesn't his dad. And when I say the basics, what I mean the basics, I don't mean like it's a simple game. His game very complex, but he doesn't do any weird sorta della hiva stuff or weird spider guard stuff. Like his game is basically the same kind of jujitsu used to see in 1994 when hickson was the king. But it's not it. It's just super tuned in and high level and razor sharp like his. One of his best submissions is the good team has another best submissions, a rear naked choke.

Speaker 2:          01:10:15       And if he gets you in those positions, you're foxville right. You know, and it's really just that his technique is so fucking sharp and it's, there's levels to that sharpness of technique. you know, there's some guys that just have a technique that is so god damn sharp, it's impossible to avoid like on a level lower level, but there was a guy named paul sas used to compete in the ufc who's to fucking triangle everybody. He wants something like nine or 10 matches by triangles. Ridiculous. He just would pull guard and then you'd be fucked. He would just figure out a way to wrap your neck and arm around his legs, squeeze the shit out of it. And next thing you know you're tapping or blacked out. Right? And people knew what he would do. They knew that that was his game and they would still get caught in a triangle.

Speaker 2:          01:10:56       It's like, what the fuck? Right? It's because his technique was so razor sharp. So I, I think there's a lot of people that get caught up in those grabbing a games, those grip dependent games and maybe they, you know, they would go, well let me try it on you. I'll fuck you up wiTh it. And they, maybe they would fuck me up with it. But I honestly believed that the best jujitsu is jujitsu that you can do with ge or without a [inaudible]. And a lot of those guys where they get into mma, they don't have any handles to grab, right? So nogi jujitsu is much more like greco roman wrestling, whereas eddie bravo and his 10th planet jiu jitsu system, when he's done a sort of incorporate much more, no, uh, like greco roman control. And you can do that. Like when I, I still roll with the gang, but when I do [inaudible] jujitsu, I very rarely grabbed the gay.

Speaker 2:          01:11:49       Right. Everything I'm doing is like under hooks over hooks. I'm getting gAble grips and I'm using nogi techniques with agi. So for me, what I like about the ge is defensively I can't fuck around, right? Like I can't just yank out of arm bars and shit. Like if you're in there with a good guy and he's got you in his garden is a key. There's so much friction that you have to really be careful. But I think offensively you have to be very careful to not use that key. Right. But the good thing about learning how to use the g, it's like say if you get in a fight with someone and they have a winter coat on their fucking dead, right? You know, some guy wants some drunk, wants to kick your ass and you just get your hand inside his collar and like, oh, look at you, you're a dead man, you know, you're dead.

Speaker 2:          01:12:31       Like if you get a guy who's like got a good ezekiel choke or something like that and he gets a hold of you and he's on top of you. And he gets his, his own color and wraps around, chokes you to death with his own arms. You know, it's, uh, that's good stuff. Yeah. There's, there's like judo player, like if someone like jimmy pedro gets a hold of your leather jacket, you're fucked man. He's gonna hit you with the world essentially. Like when someone's throwing you in the ground, like a real world class, judoka hitting you in the head with the world, they're going to throw you on your head, you're going to go unconscious. Right? Have you guys had henry akin on? No, I haven't. Henry's amazing. Yeah. Such a good guy. He's a black belt under hixon as well. Yeah, I know henry very well. Yeah. Yeah. He's, you know, hickson's black belts. There's, there's certain, there's like a. There's a few black belts like, whoa. You've got a henzel gracie black belt. That's fucking legit. Right. There's a few of those like that in hixson is one of the most legitimate those.

Speaker 1:          01:13:23       Yeah. Henry is just a great guy in his game is really interesting. Like the g and the nogi game are virtually identical. I mean you do a little stuff for the color jokes and whatnot, but otherwise it's, it's just completely uniform from geeta nogi and so it's, it's interesting for me to being 45 and trying to motor through this stuff and I'm really not that bright of a person. It's like I need transferable job skills. Like I want to learn something once and not need a million nuances for things. A dummies right now or listening to this going, you're not bright. What am I fucking champ? Shit. He's not brIght. Fuck. Could be. Could be now a, what are you doing to regulate your hormones or check your hormones? I checked them about yearly and uh, you know, the main deal with that is just keeping a really good eye on my sleep, my nutrition recovery.

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       I do some hrv monitoring and the heart rate variability, so you check that in the morning and basically hrv was studied, developed, discovered by the eastern bloc countries and it was part of the space program and it's looking at the total alice static load or the stress load on an individual. So the heart, if you have 60 beats a minute, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's beating once a second. You may have three beats that go really fast and then there may be a long pause and then two beats and so there's variability to. And it's basically chaos mathematics that describes this stuff, but if you are not under significant stress, if your parasympathetic nervous system, the rest and restore part is kind of brought to the fore like breathing, meditation, yoga, that sort of stuff. Then you tended to have more heart rate variability and that's a good thing.

Speaker 1:          01:15:05       when you get under stress, then you tend to have less heart rate variability and becomes more metronomic, so I've found that if I keep an eye on my heart rate variability in conjunction with my food and my sleep and all the rest of that stuff than the hormones tend to stay pretty good in line, but if they start pushing anything, if I start compromising sleep for me, if I go to low carb too long, particularly with some really hard training, then I will kind of get adrenalized and I get all the signs and symptoms of testosterone kind of dropping down and whatnot. Which is interesting because I know you've played around with that and seemed out some pretty good success in quito. Fueled rolling.

Speaker 2:          01:15:42       Yeah. Well, what I had was. What fascinated me is I'm on testosterone replacement therapy and when I took my diet away from a high carbohydrate diet to a much more high fat diet, ketogenic diet, my testosterone levels were way up. Interesting way up and not just me, but a bunch of my friends who were also on testosterone replacement therapy reported the same thing where they said like, my friend john is stuffed, doubled his, his, his levels doubled and he couldn't find any other variability. And it was the thing. Was that just free testosterone or fleet in total question? Um, I believe it was free. Okay. But what it, what it is apparently is, and please correct me if I'm wrong, the precursors for testosterone are the saturated fats and cholesterol in your body produces testosterone from them, right? When you have an abundance of them and you're in a healthy balance like you're about, it's not like you're consuming a unhealthy foods. When you get a healthy balance of those, your body produces more testosterone naturally.

Speaker 1:          01:16:49       Okay? Okay. Well, and it's interesting and this is where this stuff gets really complex, but usually when people are on a lower carb diet and this hormone called sex hormone binding protein or sex hormone binding globulin, that increases and what that can do, it can reduce the level of free testosterone. So your total testosterone may look good, the free testosterone may look great. That's a not an uncommon thing to happen on low carb diets. But then the interesting side to that is that the receptor sites, which are really what matters in this whole story, the receptor site density for testosterone increases so you may not need as much to get the same effect that you would otherwise have or if you have a little bit more testosterone than you're going to get an even greater effect. And so that receptor site density, like what is causing that I don't fully know.

Speaker 1:          01:17:41       Um, but when people are on a lower carb diet, it does appear that anabolic hormones have a more pronounced effect and what they would have during a, a higher carb period. And I don't really know the mechanism behind how that works, but it definitely, you seem to get, you know, if you have 100 units of testosterone or estrogen in one person and they have a certain number of a receptor sites and then another person, same hormonal level but more receptor sites than they are going to get them more potent. Anabolic response out, yeah, so many variables and then when you take into account what we've discussed already about genetic variables and the right bit, different people respond differently to that

Speaker 2:          01:18:20       hydrates and fats and proteins. It is so difficult for people to find the thing that works best for them. Right? Right. For me it seems like quito or maybe a little bit more carbs and quito is the way to go. Right. You know, but what I do is one of the big things to do is have any of it laying right here. I supplement with exoticness ketones. Okay. Yeah, and that seems to have a big effect on me. It, it definitely puts me into a state of ketosis. I use something called key genics, but I believe there's some other stuff on the on the market, but dom d'agostino, who is a professor and what is it? University of Florida, and he is one of the foremost experts on kido and he's coming on the podcast soon. We're working on finding a date, but in the meantime, his interview with tim ferriss is amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:19:04       I think he's done twice a, maybe more on tim show, but that when he discusses it, you kind of understand like what the benefits of being on this high fat diet are, and then you also realize what, what the compromise is that your body has to make when you change it to a high carbohydrate, high sugar diet. And one of the things that is a new study that dr rhonda, rhonda patrick sent me recently was the dangers of saturated fats have been sort of overstated a lot of it because of that. I'm sure you're aware that New York times article about the sugar industry, literally bing scientists lie in the 19 fifties and say that heart disease is being called caused by saturated fats and taking the blame off of sugar. Right? And they altered data and really fucked with generations of people's ideas to change the information that we receive and fuck with people's heads. But there was a recent study that showed that, um, process sugar mixed with saturated is actually

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       not healthy at all and it actually perhaps could be more unhealthy than processed sugar alone. Right? And it, it really makes sense because if we over consume carbohydrates in general than we, we fill up the liver, glycogen in the liver starts converting this into palmitic acid, which is a saturated fat. And that paul medic acid tends to make us insulin resistant and indeed good mechanisms behind that, like there's good kind of engineering there if we're eating a little bit more of an ancestral type diet, but when you throw a modern process diet and sedentism and messed up circadian rhythm, you know, not going to bed on time, not getting enough, a daylight sun, then the whole mess ends up being really pro inflammatory and very much moving you towards this insulin resistant profile. Now what is it about sugar where when you are not consuming it on a regular basis, um, and then you take some time.

Speaker 1:          01:21:06       Like I've, I've gotten like really strict ketogenic for four or five months and then I'll go off and have like a milkshake and fries and I can't fucking believe how bad I feel. And I've got to think that there's, my body just doesn't know what to do with it anymore. It doesn't, um, during the state of ketosis, so you say normal time, normally the brain runs off glucose, but what's really normal, like I, for me normal is trying to look at this from this ancestral template, you know, and so for eons, humans and every other organism on the planet didn't have consistent food and because our brain is so big and it's so metabolically active, even though I think it's like two percent of our body weight, but 20 percent of the energy use, it's really important that we protect that. And so The process of ketosis is a workaround so that we don't have to break down protein to convert it into glucose.

Speaker 1:          01:21:59       To feed the brain. We can break down body fat. The body fat gets turned into ketone bodies which are water soluble and can go through the blood brain barrier and that can fuel the brain in a really effective way. But when you do that, what you are trying to do with spare glucose, just for the brain, just for the red blood cells, the few tissues that have to run on glucose like they have no, no other work around red blood cells, and then some parts of the brain like so some parts of the brain, if you're on a really restricted sugar diet, they will suffer it initially until you get ramped up into ketosis and then you're fueling more. The brain in the numbers vary. Uh, the somewhere between 70, 80 percent of the brain can shift over fully to ketone body metabolism, but the other 20 can't, can't 20 to 30.

Speaker 1:          01:22:46       And we always, even in ketosis, we still have a blood glucose level that's being metered out by the liver. But what the body does is it creates what's called a metabolic insulin resistance where the muscles become insulin resistant so that we don't use glucose in the muscles were using free acids and we're using ketone bodies. So then you go and you've been ketotic for awhile. You have physiological insulin resistance to support and maintain that qi tonic state. That's totally fine, but then your first meal out of that is like the milkshake, you knoW, a fries, you know, 200 grams of carbohydrate and because you're physiologically insulin resistant, it takes a massive amount of insulin to be able to push that stuff into storage and it will make you feel like death. I feel terrible. I always need a nap. I feel like I have headaches and I'm like, what kind of a pussy if I become like, what's happening here because I used to, used to be easy for me.

Speaker 1:          01:23:43       Right. And you know that there's some, it's an interesting trade off because you could make an argument that we should be able to live like a cockroach and like you just, you know, you bounce back and forth, you know, under ideal circumstances we would be resilient and we could be able to shift these fuel substrates. And this is some of the argument for like intermittent fasting where you force your body to run off of fats and maybe you do a carbohydrates every couple of days or maybe earlier in the day and then later in the day it's just a fat and protein and then you fast through part of the next day so that you're forcing your body to run off fat to produce some key tones, maybe not at a level of full nutritional ketosis. But then also when you do drop in some carbs, your body can handle that and it doesn't put you into that kinda like diabetic blood sugar levels.

Speaker 1:          01:24:34       And, and, uh, it's all really speculative. I don't really know what the right answer is with any of that stuff, but it is interesting and it does kind of call into question the, you know, how useful is chronic ketosis relative to being able to cycle in and out of it. And I don't have a good answer, but I definitely feel best when I'm qi tonic. You feel best when your qi tonic, but you tend to do a little bit higher carbohydrate to fuel the jujitsu, jujitsu. So, and that doesn't knock you out of a state of ketosis as long as you've been fairly consistent. It does. And I do. So when I'm fully keto adapted, the blood ketone levels are higher. And also like if I needed to miss a meal, you know, if I just didn't get breakfast, lunch, dinner, and I want a full day, it would be inconsequential, like I would be a little hungry, but it really wouldn't affect me.

Speaker 1:          01:25:21       That's the biggest benefit of opinions. Huge. And so when I do that 75 to 120 grams of carbs to fuel the jujitsu, I can't do that as easy, like 10 hours and 12 hours in of uh, you know, uh, so I sleep. I'll sleep through the night. So I've got a 12 hour fast then I get up in, if I tried to go to 6:00 PM that day, I'd be hungry. I wouldn't be totally broken down dysfunctional like I was when I was know insulin resistant sugar burner. But it's not the same as being keto adapted now. Do you mess it all with exogenous ketones? I do a little bit, but the ketone salts give me the trots. So Yeah. So those are kind of rough. I do a lot of the, a caveman coffee and then they're mct oil and I'll actually mix that up with peanut butter and then either a soy lecithin or a sunflower less than because it kind of a multifocal.

Speaker 1:          01:26:11       All that stuff. So I'll mix it up together and then I'll eat that and I get a decent point five millimolar blood ketone level off of that even though I'm eating some carbs with it. That's interesting. So now you're your peanut butter is a sugar free peanut butter natural peanut butter peanut butter peanut butter. People say, oh jeff, I'm going to just eat it by the tub and while you will. And then peanuts or are legumes. And so there's a bunch of like super hardcore paleo folks that are freaking out and dying right now that I'm eating peanut butter. So now why don't paleo people like peanuts? What the fuck's wrong with them? So legumes do have some, what we call immunogenic properties. They can irritate the immune system and if you improperly prepare them then they can make you really sick. Like if you.

Speaker 1:          01:26:58       If you cooked some black beans or kidney beans or something, you didn't cook them enough and you weighed them, it can give you gas, right? It's like where you're shitting blood essentially. It's pretty pretty nasty stuff and these are the anti predation chemicals that are in grains and legumes, but if you soak them overnight, you pull off the rinse water, maybe sprout them for a day and you don't even have to do that involved. Or if you cook them in a medium that has a little bit of acid in it, then it tends to break down these anti nutrients and they're not nearly as immunogenic, but somebody who has serious gi problems and this circles back again to that, that small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Somebody who has cbo, somebody has some other gi probLems. if they have an autoimmune condition, grains and legumes may be something that you want to minimize because it is immunogenic.

Speaker 1:          01:27:44       For a lot of people, and this is the success that we've seen with this autoimmune paleo approach. So I think that the, the unfortunate thIng is on the one hand, there are a lot of people who dismissed the power of limiting these foods in people that would benefit their. Like there's no science to support it and they've never invested a minute towards researching it. So they're ignorant about that. But then on the other side, there's a whole group of people that maybe they had success with this autoimmune paleo protocol. They had ulcerative colitis, they had multiple sclerosis, they had success for it. Now they say that nobody can or should eat these foods and you know, I, I've got to throw myself under the bus. I've probably been that person for a decade or longer, you know, but over the course of time, just life it, it's that jujitsu thing again, you know, where it's like the truth will pound you and at some point you either get it or you just become this like calcified old turd and you can't learn or grow.

Speaker 1:          01:28:42       And over the course of time, it just became obvious that if your gut is healthy, if all the cylinders are firing, doing some grains and legumes is probably not going to be a negative problem for you, but if you are a cop or a firefighter in the military and you've historically been able to eat these foods and then you go to a shift work schedule and you're under a massive amount of stress because of an altered sleep wake cycle, those foods that may have been okay may no longer now be okay. And so that's another piece that people just need to remain open. That something that's working for you today may not work for you tomorrow. And then you know, something that worked for me may not work for this other person. It's kind of common sense, but people just desperately in this health, wellness, nutrition realm, they want black or white, yes or no binary stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:29:31       This is good, that's bad. And as much as I would, it would make my life way simpler if that was the case. But it's just not like there's all this variability in there. Are you familiar with the dunning kruger effect? Yes. Okay. So yeah, so dunning kruger effect, like if you do like the x, y axis, the x axis is going out and this is time and the y axis is your perceived knowledge on a topic when you don't have any time in a topic, then you assume that you know everything about it and they call it mount stupid. And I spent a lot of time in mount stupid and um, as we all, as we all have. And then there's this low, like low abv, the dark teatime of the soul. You know, where you've been in it. Yeah, there we go. And so as that stretches out, then you get some, hopefully some degree of aptitude, but the, as you learn more and more and more, you're confident about any given topic just starts going down more and more.

Speaker 1:          01:30:25       And I'm at this point now where I'm like, I don't know if I know anything about any topic. And I guess that that's kind of a good process. Ten years ago I was much more confident about a whole host of things. It's like there's a right answer and there's a wrong answer, and today I just really don't know. Yeah, there's a great expression about that. As the lake of knowledge increases, the shoreline of ignorance grows as well. Yeah. I think dennis mckenna had to take onto that. As you increase the bonfire of knowledge, it exposes the greater level of ignorance the light does. It's a natural human tendency for some strange reason to want to know everything or to want to pretend you know, everything. It's like a defensive mechanism or something. Definitely is a defensive mechanism and it's just so appealing to to basically put a fence around what your current knowledge status and be like.

Speaker 1:          01:31:16       There it is. We're good. You know, it's a really tough deal to just kind of dangling the breeze and to hang that sign, you know? good. Until further notice. Yeah, and that's why today it's so weird because you can find other people that agree with you on that and they pump you up and give you that confirmation bias and they support each other and they get together and make fun of everybody who's not in the nose. That hashtag woke. Right? Oh god. And you know, I had a lot of that like running across fit type gym. I would recommend this low carb paleo type of approach and for people that were insulin resistant, overweight, it worked amazingly well. And then when I started working with more mma oriented folks and a cross fitters, they, it took a long time and breaking a lot of people to figure out, okay, these people need some more carbs, you know, like they may not need as much as what they've historically done, but there's fully quito fuel process is probably not going to work with them.

Speaker 1:          01:32:15       And it broke some people, including myself. What's very hard for people to wrap their head around the idea that eating fruit is not a good idea. Like eating too much fruit could be bad for you. People are lIke, what? Right, you can eat a banana and some strawberries and some grapes and an orange and I feel great and some people might, but there's a lot of people that can get in the deep end of the, the, you know, the blood sugar management story with that. Yeah. Yeah. That seems so counterintuitive to what we've been told as kids. Like you have some fruit, it's good for you. It tastes good and it's good for you. You're like, oh, okay, great. it's good for you. Well, it's interesting. We have these, uh, old variety crab apples on my property, johnny appleseed kind of deal and that's what apple's effectively used to be.

Speaker 1:          01:33:00       We can narrow those at each other. Yeah, we, we make cider out of it and it turns, turns pretty good for that. But uh, if you pull up like an image of what an original banana looks like, oh, they're ridiculous. Like seed. Yeah. It's tiny and it's all seeds and there's hardly any edible structure to it. And so if you look at most of the fruit that was available kind of pre agriculture and that, that, uh, a selective breeding of fruit, like it was much smaller, wasn't as sweet. And again, it's not to say that you shouldn't have any of that stuff, but it's just, there was a interesting piece that came out of the uk where it was looking at feeding kids fruit. They were like, let's, let's recommend that these kids eat fruit and the kids already had a hyper caloric diet. They were eating too much.

Speaker 1:          01:33:46       They were eating too many carbs and then they threw fruit on top of it and they're like, wow, adding fruit to this already shitty overeating program made it worse, you know? And it was like there was going to be some sort of magic that came out of adding some fruit to this story. Whereas the kids just needed to pull more of the junk out and get some sort of both caloric control land. Some carbohydrate control is really interesting. Is there any fruit that is in its original state? Like maybe pomegranates, they kinda berries are pretty pretty, you know, uh, blueberries, blackberries, so sorts of things while they're pretty similar to that. Sweet. Not that sweet. No different. Different flavor. Yeah. No. Yeah, I've, I've picked them like in the wild, like in the back country, like a blueberry and it just like, hmm, this is not bad, but it's not spectacular.

Speaker 1:          01:34:37       It's not what you're used to. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, but oranges clearly they have been fucked with, right? Yeah. Apple's like we were on a trip once and bought these apples and they were literally like the size of a softball and you bite into it. It's like the most delicious dessert you could ever have. Like this can't be a fucking real regular apple. Right. Something's been going on. Or noble apple. I mean, how much of our food, I mean especially at our fruit, how much of it is genetically altered? It's got to be massive amounts and you know, that gmo story. I'm in a spot where I usually piss everybody off about it because I am way less concerned about genetic modification of these things and more concerned about some of the business practices that happen, like we've been doing selective breeding for thousands of years and that has modified the genetics back to the wolf, turning into dog story like that, tomatoes, everything and without.

Speaker 1:          01:35:32       I mean the classic thoughts of franken foods meaning laboratory, some sort of injection into that's not what's going on. Selective breeding for the most part, most of it's selective breeding and the thing about gmo to is the apologist for it. Like when you look at the results that you get with the gmo, the genetic modification, it's really unimpressive. I mean it's not like dramatically increasing yields. What it inevitably is doing is creating something that's usually more resistant to roundup than what the last thing was wound up being that pesticide foster, yeah. Yeah. Which is legitimately some pretty nasty stuff and so it doesn't really seem to be working any type of magic as far as feeding the world or anything like that. It is creating a funnel where in order to grow this thing, you need more chemical fertilizer input, you need more pesticide input and it just seems to be this feed forward mechanism on that.

Speaker 1:          01:36:29       And so I'm, I'm really from a health standpoint, I'm not that freaked out aBout gmos just as a baseline, but from a really shady business practice. I'm not a big fan from a, uh, actually moving the needle on food production. It's really unimpressive to me. So I, my position on gmos usually just makes everybody mad because I'm not really jumping into either one of these, these camps, whole hog with food production in general. When you look at these gigantic large scale farms that has, that is one of the most unnatural things you're ever going to see in life. Right? There's giant cornfields, right? That's so unnatural, right? monocrop. Yeah. And not only that monocrop, but those are genetically modified crops and you know, and you want to kill off all the weeds, spraying your genetiCally modified mono crops with some shit that kills off everything, but you're genetically modified model crops and who knows what that consequences on the human body will.

Speaker 1:          01:37:25       So a roundup is now being suggested or has been suggested for a long time as a mitochondrial disruptor, similar to that antibiotic story. So tHis is where people, you know the last questions about like, well what about this gluten intolerance thing? Like people didn't have it 50 years ago, why is it going on now? And we really don't know, but maybe it's antibiotics, maybe it's changes in the gut microbiome, but a lot of this stuff seems to have a mitochondrial dysfunction piece to it. Parkinson's, alzheimer's, type two diabetes. They all seem to have mitochondrial dysfunction elements to them. The mitochondria is not producing energy the way that it should. And back again to that point about being flexible with our fuel systems, people seem to becoming inflexible in their fuel systems. and this key todrick state may be the default that we're able to go back to to be able to maintain some degree of health and it also seems to press a reset button in the mitochondria where we get apoptosis and cell death and abnormal cells, but the need for people to shift towards a lower carb diet may be reflective of some changes in the environment where we're being made sick by things like glyophosphate or maybe an over aggressive antibiotic use and then the thing that we need to default back to to be able to be healthy as some sort of a low carb or ketogenic diet.

Speaker 1:          01:38:43       Now, when you're talking about foods and foods that people eat and breads and gluten deficiencies or gluten intolerances, what about sprouted breads and what are the. What are the difference between something like a zucchini bread and say like a wonder bread? Yeah, so within the zucchini bread, they soak these grains, pour off the water, let them sprout, and in that sprouting process, the enzymes that are released tend to break up the gluten and gluten proteins. And for a lot of people who are gluten intolerant with like a piece of wonder bread or standard french bread, they could eat something like these equal bread. Not everybody can. I can't. Like if I had a piece when I hit your bathroom, it would need a priest and an exorcism that you would break it over and you know I was never. We've looked at celiac is a gluten intolerance, but if I get some sort of a wheat exposure and it's to the degree that like if a steak is grilled on a grill and somebody grilled french toast on the grilled the day before, I'm going to be sick from it.

Speaker 1:          01:39:44       So I'm like the canary in the coal mine on it sucks. It's amazing. Fascinating. But does it have any bay? Does it have any effect on nutrient absorption because of the celiacs? A big part of it is when you're exposed to that bread, it's not just that you go to get diarrhea, but they. The nutrients are not getting into your system. Right? Because of the intestinal permeability. The way I got into all this stuff, I was really, really sick. And had all sort of colitis and I'm about 175 pounds right now when my ulcerative colitis was at its worst, I was 130 pounds. So I was 40 pounds skinnier. How old are you? I'm 45 now. But now how old were you then at that point? I was like 27, 28. oh wow. Yeah. So look like death. I, I looked like concentrAtion camp deal. yeah. And it was just malabsorption, like I couldn't absorb anything. I was shoveling food down and for me at that point it was a high, it was a grain and legume based kind of a vegan diet, which for me was just not working for that point in my life. Living in seattle, not having any sun like that was a really, really bad move forming it. But I will say this, this was also on the heels of getting and resolving at least to degree grd.

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       So I think that parasitic infection, low vitamin d levels, bad sleep, bad circadian rhythm, like all that stuff fed into it. And so for combination there. yeah, if you want to get taken down at the necaps that was a good way to do it. And to cure giardia, what did they give you? Might trinitas hall, which is a antimicrobial that they use for things like grd and then also some of the rk bactor bacteria. so, so these kind of parasitic bacteria type things. And does that have an effect on mitochondria as well? The same way the antibiotics do I. It's not the same way, but it is a mitochondrial disruptor as well. Yeah. What, what is a pro mitochondria supplement? Is there anything then? so like resveratrol, fasting, ketosis, those things all tend to flip some switches in the mitochondria that make them healthier and more robust, variable varying things rather on a reservoir trawl being absorbable, it's very difficult to absorb it.

Speaker 4:          01:41:57       Yeah. Yeah. What is the best way? I'm usually, it's some sort of an emulsification with fat and, and uh, you know, life realized and so it's, it's quite fat soluble. So if you can get it mixed into a fatty matrix, then it enhances the absorption. But it does seem to. And, and you know, most of this data is petri dish type data, so we really don't know if it's having great effect in the body and then there's another layer to this. A Ton of these polyphenolics don't really enter the body or they don't enter the body as the original chemical. They get modified by the gut bacteria and then either the gut bacteria manufacturer completely different chemical or some sort of downstream chemical is what enters the body, or it may just interface with the gut lining and then the gut sends out different signaling molecules that then affects the rest of the body.

Speaker 4:          01:42:46       Wow. So it depends upon the healthiness of your gut bacteria. It that's a massive impact. it has a massive impact on whether or not that [inaudible] or other similar nutrients get an just pharmaceuticals in general. Like when you look at people going on a heart med or you know, different things like depending what something that their understanding is not only do we have genetic differences, but the differences in the gut microbiome may have a really profound influence in the way that people respond to supplements. Pharmaceuticals, yeah. Yeah. It's just so much to take in for the person and the average person is listening to this that wants to sort of optimize their health. There's so many. There should Be like. It's kind of amazing. I guess it's a lot of this is because this is a fairly new discipline in terms of the last few decades and guys like you who are on the forefront of it.

Speaker 4:          01:43:37       I've done some person and chris kresser who's gone through his own deal. He was a macrobiotic vegan point in time and now he tells you to eat liver and, and you and you should see pictures of it. He ended up getting a really nasty gut bug in I think the Philippines and um, pictures of him before. He was like jacked super thick legs, like thick neck tie boxer and now he's pretty wavy and he's never really been able to put all the weight back on and kind of get back to is as robust as what he was before that. But it was another situation where maybe some irritation to the gut because of the diet and indefinitely this infectious agent, whatever the bug was that he caught, just crushed him. There should be some sort of a place that you could go like a string of places, you know, where you can open them up in major cities and metropolitan areas where someone can go and find out like what is the right stuff to do?

Speaker 4:          01:44:33       I went to this one, they did some blood work on me and the lady told me, avocados just don't agree with you. I'm like, fuck off. That is so dumb. TheRe's not a god I've. I eat avocados all the time. They're great. There's just trying to come up with some sort of ridiculous blood test that shows the avocados. I'm like, that's not real, right. That can't be real, can it? There's not much again, that that stuff gets really. Especially avocado. I know it's like damn avocado. So if somebody has intestinal permeability of for whatever reason, then you can become reactive unlike the igg antibody testing. But it does. But the problem is not the food specifically. The problem is that you have gut permeability, so if they fix that gut permeability, then you're no longer really going to react to the food because the food doesn't get into your body.

Speaker 4:          01:45:24       Then you break it down into the protein, into the amino acids and fatty acids in the the constituent carbs, and so the immunogenic properties that it had before, don't really matter because it's in your gut and when the contents are inside to get. It's outside the body. Is there any test that they can do with your blood that would show that in any way and is there any way that avocados, one of the healthiest food known to man could possibly be something you should avoid? Avocados are a not uncommon allergens, so some people do develop allergies to avocado seed essentially with that fruit around it. So there are some immunogenic proteins to it. It would have a pretty obvious reaction than if you were allergic to chocolate again, and this is where the reaction wouldn't be grabbing another chip and dip it in the guacamole.

Speaker 4:          01:46:14       That's awesome. Yeah, and usually it's something like foggy headedness or a gi issue or you know, like joint creakiness or something like that. Creakiness the joints actually physically make. They just don't feel so. Yeah. So it feels like they're. yeah. Yeah. What about sugar causes that inflammation? Because that is a big factor with people that have injuries even if it's not injuries, if they have joint pain, like knee pains, back pains. I've had this conversation with people and I got it from a chiropractor. She said, believe it or not, like gluten insensitivity, just reducing gluten and becoming gluten

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       free will change the way injuries hurt like back injuries. And I thought well that sounds like some hippie bullshit. And so this was many years ago when I started getting into this idea of inflammatory foods that are affecting the way your body and your joints particular field, but she only took it to the point of gluten. Right? And then it wasn't a sugar thing for her. And then once I started looking into sugar, I'm like, oh, these are all foods that cause inflammation. Well, what is happening? What causes it? What? How does sugar or high sugar processed sugar diet, how does that cause inflammation? So a couple of different mechanisms that can happen here. We we definitely understand that the sugar can feed bacteria, both good and bad bacteria. If most of the bacterial masto should be occurring in the colon, like pretty far south, and if we eat a diet that's really deficient in fiber, high in refined carbohydrates, all carbohydrates get absorbed early and so there's not actually any food for the bacteria that should be living in the colon.

Speaker 1:          01:47:53       So these bacteria tend to move more, more upward in the gi tract. And this is where we get small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Sibo is a pro inflammatory process, so that's one way that we can get inflammation out of that. Another way is just when we get really wild swings in blood sugar, that tends to be a pro inflammatory process. So just the upregulation of insulin, particularly if it's over a chronic process that can be a pro inflammatory experience. And then the other pieces, you know, if you start getting cortisol released in response to blood sugar crashes because you get hypoglycemic and you're trying to ping the liver to release some more glucose, that can be a pro inflammatory processes, the inflammation, what's the physical reaction? Like what is happening when you say inflammation? So there's a bunch of different mediators there, so you've got different cytokines.

Speaker 1:          01:48:43       These chemicals like interleukin one, interleukin six that are turning on typically immune cells and then other cells in the body are being effected as Well, but it's usually some sort of immune cell response which then they in their process and doing what they do, they tend to release chemicals, cytokines, and in similar chemicals that it can turn into a feed forward mechanism. So the, you know, it's ultimately chemical messaging that can turn on other inflammatory processes in cells that are nearby and also the immune cells themselves. So that is causing these joints to be painful and then back to the joint. So whenever we do anything, any type of workout, even just exercise. So. So this is important, important point to make to inflammation in and of itself isn't necessarily bad, it's the amount and type and placement and all that type of stuff. So exercise is a proinflammatory process. It's what we call a hormetic stress. So we get a little bit of this stress, ideally an appropriate dose and the body senses

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       this stress and then it makes us stronger so that we can cope with a subsequent exposure to this. But if our sYstem is already pro inflamed from poor diet, inadequate sleep, gut permeability, what have you, than these little, you know, tears and bumps and bruises and adhesions that we get from physical activity, they never really heal because our body is allocating resources to deal with the inflammation in the gut and are kind of over hyped up inflammatory response and it doesn't have the resources to deal with the inflammation in our joints and our muscles and whatnot. Hm. Interesting. So what, what are the best anti inflammatories supplements or foods that people can take? Because ibuprofen is something you should pretty clearly avoid now using sparingly. Yeah, and this is for, for people that are not listening or that are listening to this, that are not aware, it's been shown over the last few years in particular that ibuprofen is exactly pretty dangerous.

Speaker 4:          01:50:49       Um, and, and can cause a host heart attack. Yeah, it increases like 60 percent of strokes. I'm a good friend of mine, cameron hanes, who's a marathon runner and an ultra marathon runner. You used to take it every day and he was always in pain. Right. And what was fascinating was I did a podcast with rhonda patrick where she talked about the dangers of it and talked about how horrible it is for your gut bacteria, right? And that that could in fact be causing the actual inflammation that you're trying to fight with the ibuprofen. Then this continual cycle and lupe got him off of it and his Joint pain went away. Right? Which is just insane. You think, how does this happen? How does this guy has joint pain all the time and he's taken ibuprofen for the joint pain. He thinks it's just a fact of life in the joint.

Speaker 4:          01:51:32       Pain is an inflammatory process and he's taking an anti inflammatory, which you would think, oh, this is probably a win, but it, you know, in the complexity is kind of kind of crazy. But yeah, and interestingly it seems to be gut bacteria mediated. Now what, like when a person does have some sort of an issue, like a headache or some sort of a swollen joint or some, some pain, is there anything that you can take that has anti inflammatory properties? It doesn't have the negative health consequences, you know. And for me, this is my, my own, I'll maybe give you some of my own triage with this stuff. Like I had an l four l five disc injury about 15 years ago doing crossfit at crossfit hq of all places. It was pretty, pretty catastrophic. But um, uh, what was the disc bulging with? So the first workout was 75 glute ham sit ups, which you know, you're on like a glute ham developer and you're doing a super long range of movement sit up.

Speaker 4:          01:52:26       And I ended up with abdo. Like basically my stomach was inflamed. It was inflamed for like 12 days. It was about 13 days later. We're pulling abdo abdo instead of rhabdo like the rhabdomyolysis maya licenses. When you overtrain your body literally starts breaking down your muscle tissues and you had pick up your kidneys and you can die. Yeah, so I had kind of a compartmental syndrome with this. It was just in the abs, but it was bad. So my app is just overworked. Your abs massively overworked. I mean there was no up no ramp up. This is the first time I've seen this movement and I did 75. Yeah, it was ridiculous. So I'm 12. Thirteen days later we were supposed to pull max dead lifts. My abs were still not healed and I'd like for 65 on the bar. I was just passing my knees and my abs just failed.

Speaker 4:          01:53:14       And so I had this like fluxion injury with a lot of load. It, a very precarious spot. And I know for l five disc injury, it's bulging. It's not ruptured, but if I don't mobilize, if I sit too much, if, if my hip flexors get tight, it will get super cranky. So I will get to spots, like if I'm working a lot where I have to take some ibuprofen and all. So you have this injury still to this, but yeah, like it's way better in general, but every once in a while I can piss it off pretty good. Have you ever used a reverse hyper? Yes. Yeah. And it definitely helps. Definitely helps. I mean when I, when I stay on my mobility maintenance cycle, I am good to go, but when I get super busy when I'm traveling, you know, if I have to sleep in a weird bed or something like it's tends to be a cumulative thing to adds up over like two weeks.

Speaker 4:          01:54:01       And then I can get kind of a back flip for people who, Uh, someone just asked about this on twitter yesterday, the reverse hypers and machine created by a guy named louie simmons who is a really famous power lifter and a completely insane person who, if you want to listen to the podcast, jamie and I did with him at his place, west side barbell, he's, he's a fucking nut but genius in making this machine that out allows active decompression of the spine. I'm a big fan of it. Um, do you do any sort of spinal decompression exercises? So both, uh, you know, kind of the, the inversion board and then also just um, hanging. I'll actually use some, you know, weight lifting straps and go out on a pull up bar, hands together and it'll hang for like three minutes at a shot. So we'll get to rassic decompression and then also.

Speaker 4:          01:54:48       So it's not grip dependent, right? I do thAt, but I do it with the grip. I just, because I feel like for jujitsu and for all the other things, I need strong hand. So I'll just kill two birds with one stone. Yeah. For that I'm on wanting such a training stimulus for loosening my thoracic girdle and everything that it's gonna. It's gonna wipe out my grip. My grip would fail way before I would get that kind of thoracic opening. Yeah. Did you ever think maybe you should work your grip to grip? But I, I mean we're talking about it. It's a fairly fat bar also that I have. Okay. And so I'm just using that as a little bit of a bridge for that, but I mean like there's a real benefit in having a federal bar, right? Uh, it, it, it, you can get strength from here rather as strange. I think again, like this variety, you know, like getting as much variety as possIble. I love rope climbs. Like if I had one pulling movement I was going to use, it would probably be a rope climb like that. Interesting. Yeah. And you get this unilateral movement

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       but you're also like, you're, you get pack involvement. Lattes are rated the whole thing and and as you pull it in it tends to look a lot like a lot of the positions and the strength in, In jujitsu and so you also, as part of it, you can work these lock off says as part of the the transition. So for me it just ends up getting more development across my back, my arms, my shoulders in one movement than I could get from any other type of polling activity. That makes sense. Now

Speaker 2:          01:56:13       as far as like lower back decompression, do you ever do that one where you're hanging from your waist? Only from the waist down. I love that one. That one seems to isolate the lower spine. What is the name of that thing that we have in the back? Jamie? The one that does that one. Spinal decompression machine that we put together back there. The one with your feet, the hangups thing? No, not the hangup one but the other one. The one that you kinda looks like it looks like a roman setup chair and so, but it's just for decompression and you just leaned forward and it just, it seems to target directly the lower back, much better than just the ankle ones. The ones from the ankle, I feel like my legs are holding a little too much and I'm hanging on. I'm controlling it a little too much. Right. Whereas this one, I can completely let go.

Speaker 1:          01:57:01       Well in some of the, the uh, the gravity boots, like they were finding that people were getting like laxity and their knees, like the knees were giving away before you really decompress the back. THat makes sense. Yeah, that makes sense. But,

Speaker 2:          01:57:12       but also some of that lacks in the knees. Probably believed some knee pressure on some folks as well. Sort of like how shoulder hangs releases a lot of shoulder pain and some people. Right, right,

Speaker 1:          01:57:22       right. Yeah, totally. Totally. Yeah. But back to your question about the, uh, any inflammatories, like if I get a really spicy backflow or I will do 800 milligrams of ibuprofen, but I'll hit it once and then I'm good. Do you feel any adverse effects because you don't do it a lot, do you feel like, do you take it and then feel any health consequences? I, I don't, but I mean one of the primary health consequences as killing over from a heart attack or stroke. So, you know, but it's one of those things where I've played with it and once it gets in that, you know, I can ice it and I can do stem and all that stuff helps. But it's just like, man, if I can get one targeted bolus of, of ibuprofen 800 milligrams, I hit it once and it just drops it down and then, you know, I, it, it changes the whole thing from being a two day issue to like a 12 day issue because otherwise they'll just kind of drag on and, and I've just gotten to a point where if I really get myself into a bad spot with my mobility or, or just getting this thing pissed off, then it's like, okay, I've just got to do this.

Speaker 1:          01:58:24       But then beyond that there's this product from a new chapter called ziflow mend and it's really, really pretty slick as far as, uh, an anti inflammatory. It pulls, um, some ginger extract. Curcumin, they do a super critical extract on

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       it and that stuff is pretty legit. And that can, for a lot of people, like I haven't found that it works as well on that pain and inflammation reduction when my back gets really spicy. But it's pretty darn good in everything that's in it. You could make some arguments. It would be pretty beneficial over the long haul. Like, it's uh, uh, these uh, uh, cox, two pathways modifiers, but they, it does it in a different way than what the ibuprofen does. Is it dose dependent? I mean, is there a, like a point of diminishing returns where you get 800 milligrams is like the magic number for ibuprofen? They say you shouldn't go over that. Right. But is it something like that with this stuff? I don't know. I don't know, like they have a recommended dose on it, but I haven't really played around with that, but I mean everything usually has some sort of a, you know, kinetics like dose response curve with it.

Speaker 4:          01:59:30       So I would assume so. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I was wondering. I'm like, what if you took our hyper doses? I haven't tried that. I have not tried that because it's all natural stuff, rigHt? Like, curcumin is not really dangerous in larger doses. Is it a, I don't know about the tox toxicology on that, you know, like, um, uh, just because it's natural doesn't necessarily mean that it's non toxic arsenic. Yeah. Yeah. So that's, that's interesting. Um, I w that is an interesting idea. I haven't really thought about going beyond what the recommended is on that. Yeah, I would wonder if that would ramp it up. Other than that, what about aspirin? Aspirin has some benefit. Aspirin has some benefit, but it's. It's kind of an interesting mixed bag too late to take enough of it to get a really potent effect. Like you would like if somebody had a back spasm or something like that.

Speaker 4:          02:00:21       You're looking at the potential of gi bleeding. You have a really potent blood thinning effects, so I mean aspirins a little bit dodgy in in that regard, that really acute deal that you're. You're trying to manage, but it is a possibly interesting side note. Aspirin like a baby aspirin a day. there's some studies that have suggested that women taking that baby aspirin a day. It could reduce breast cancer potentiality by like 70 percent because of the antiangiogenic effects of the aspirin. Now I've read some things about the ketogenic diet and cancer and that is very fascinating to me about having these high fat, Low complex carbohydrates, low simple carbohydrate diets can have a great benefit on reducing the fuel that cancer needs to stay alive. It's, I would say it's at least twofold. It's probably multifactorial there, but so on the one hand, certain types of cancer tend to preferentially run on glucose and so if you can limit the glucose, they don't really do well with fats or proteins as a fuel source, so you can limit that. Not all cancers falling into this category. That was some cancers are super metabolically flexible and they can use just about anything as a fuel source, so there's a benefit for potentially breast, colon, prostate,

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       glioblastoma, a couple of other endothelial derived cancers that just directly that reduction in glucose level may be really beneficial. There was another layer to it though that that low glucose environment and that shift towards ketosis tends to set up this kind of stress response, so we actually have a little bit of oxydative stress occurring in the mitochondria and normal tissue. Do great with that, but cancerous tissue does not, so it's a little bit of an irritant and what they're doing right now, what they're studying is getting folks ramped up on a ketogenic diet so that you get that hormetic stress response. You're limiting glucose and then they will have people fast immediately before chemo or radiation. so this is still doing some conventional therapies, but that fasting state that while you're also in ketosis, it reduces your pool of this substance called glutathione, which is our normal antioxidant defense network.

Speaker 1:          02:02:37       So interestingly, and maybe counterintuitively, they're trying to reduce your antioxidant pool and get it down to a bare minimum. Then when they whack you and the cancer with the chemo and the radiation, the cancer is more prone to die because it doesn't have antioxidant defense mechanisms to keep it going. So it's a, it's an interesting thing because a lot of, uh, people in the kind of alternative cancer treatment scene, you know, they'll start dosing people on super high antioxidants with the, the thought that some of the etiology of cancer may be driven by free radicals by, by oxidative damage. And there may be some truth to that, but it's kinda like the, the horses out of the barn at this point, they're kind of tackling it in the wrong way and even when they're using high dose vitamin c, they're using it intravenously and even though vitamin c is touted as an antioxidant, it can be a pro oxidated high substances and so are at high concentrations.

Speaker 1:          02:03:31       So what, maybe a situation where you get the glutathione pool depleted, you hit these people with high dose vitamin c and then they maybe do hyperbaric oxygen where they go into a, a, a pressurized canister and they, they do pure co two and that increases the oxidative stress and that may be another adJunctive treatment to this. But that's all of these different mechanisms that are kind of an outgrowth of the key to genic diet going on in the background. Wow. Um, do you mess around with cryotherapy at all? Not a ton. I mean, I, I live on a little three acre farm and, and a rino. And so it's cold frequently and I have like a tub of water and never once while when I buy sack up I'll go out there and sit in it. But it's so cold water, it's not like, you know, throw ice in there anything. Well, I mean there's usually for much of the year there's a little layer of ice on the top of it. And so I've got to like chisel that out and then you climb in and out of climate and measure the temperature. Now, I mean it's, it's, uh, it's somewhere slightly above freezing because, you know, it's got an inch or two of ice on top of it. But after you add rhonda patrick on here, um, I kind of opted

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       more for the, a hot sauna kind of deal with this. I'm like, dude, that's a lot. That's way easier than it seems really positive here. Yeah. And I've been doing that after jujitsu and on the days when I can pull that off, my recovery is amazing. It's almost like I pressed the reset button that day and although I got the benefit of jujitsu, I didn't have any of the downside. It is crazy and I didn't experience that when I would do a cryo immersions after exercise. Like I felt better kind of, you know, when the first maybe hour or two after a hard workout during the cold water immersion, but then a day or two later like I was still sore and joint creaky and all that stuff. Whereas with the sauna you get, it's not an infrared sauna, it's just like this hot as balls sought 140 degrees plus and I would sit in there as long as I could 15, 20 minutes and man, wHen when I finally break and I want out, it's like if there was an old person in front of me getting out of there, I would push them to panic.

Speaker 4:          02:05:38       Getting out of there. Yeah, no. Is there a differentiation in your body between a steam shower and a sauna? Like when you get into one of those hot steam showers and it's 135 degrees and your data, is it good because it's heat response, right? That's really what's going to spawn heat shock proteins. Yeah, I know it did. Rhonda patrick would know that one. I do not know it. It seems like for me that air can be hotter in. It's interesting though because water can confers or, or removes a heat like 30 times faster than air does. So like uh, you know, so um, you could heat or cool the Body much faster with water then you came with eric clearly. And so I'm wondering, you know, would you need water that's as hot as the air to get the same type of temperature elevation in your body or is just the skin being exposed, exposed to air temperature and it's like an oven.

Speaker 4:          02:06:35       Is that, is there something kind of cool with that? Like I, I don't know, that's a good question for that one too, rhonda. Yeah, I'll make a note of that. Yeah. Um, what about, uh, other forms of recovery post workout and found anything to be beneficial? Are you messing around at all with like those hard balls? Like those wad balls? I do some stuff like that. Like I, so I followed this gymnastics bodies program that I wanted to ask you about that. Yeah. And it's really good and they have so they have the strength work as part of this whole thing pressing and pulling all kinds of trunk work and everything. But each strength movement has a mobility movement paired with it. So it's, it's really interesting because as you get stronger doing this stuff, there's a tendency to get tighter so they just kind of bake the mobility movement into the cake with that.

Speaker 4:          02:07:22       But then they also have a three day a week stretching sequence once the front splits, once the side splits. And then the other one is thoracic mobility for like a back bend. And so I just kind of punch the time clock on that like each day have some strength and mobility work that I do with that three days a week. I do the um, the dedicated stretching sequence, I tend to do it with my daughters, they're like three and five and so we just get into the floor and you know, it's just a shit show in there with them also, but it's a ton of fun and we'll hit that like three days a week and that's been really good. I'm a meditation app, like doing something like brainwave, the binaural beats. I'm so wound tight and kind of type a that if I can just like sit down, go outside, look at the trees, do five minutes on that thing, do some kind of cyclic breathing.

Speaker 4:          02:08:10       That's amazing for me. Like that is a really, really good system reset for me. have you done any isolation tank work? I have done some isolation take away. We tried to get me, uh, to go out to torrance last time when I was here and I couldn't make it happen. I've done that since I've done that. Yeah. So tell me what you've been doing and how often. I don't do it often. It's usually when I'm traveling, there is a place in reno now, like it's just kind of getting into reno and all over the country now. it is amazing. I had a guy apprOached me with a, a, an idea for a, a pretty legit business model around this and we were kind of looking at some people putting some money into it and then I heard that massage envy was going to open up a, uh, you know, the float tanks and they're everywhere.

Speaker 4:          02:08:51       Like there's massage envy on like every corner. And so I was like, okay, data that backed out of that because you didn't think that it would be profitable that way. I thought it'd be really easy to get out maneuvered by a multi offering, kind of kind of, you know. But that makes sense. Yeah. Massage and float all in one location. And if they sell weed to float tanks, plus weed is like the greatest thing in the world for relaxation, right? Yeah. Yup. In reno now load Nevada is now. Remember on board with that Nevada. Yeah. The longest time to vita was one of the strictest places in the world. You if you got caught with a joint, you went to jail for something like seven years. It was really crazy. It, it's a interesting environment because you have like brothels around there, you have the gambling, but then there was this pretty like draconian approach to uh, you know, like really minor drug offenses that they should be offensive at all is.

Speaker 4:          02:09:44       Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous. now, have you messed around at all with cbd oil or cbd, which is non psychoactive but has tremendous beneficial properties for anti-inflammation? I have not. And it's one of those things that's on the list to do. Yeah. Yeah. Get on that. Because you would think that with someone when I was asking you about a anti-inflammation, things like cbd apparently has profound effects. You know, what's interesting about cbd is that everything that you would think is good about kind of a paleo ketogenic diet, sleeping well, exercising, right? Cbd does it effectively. Now it doesn't work the sAme in every single person and you need to kind of play around with that. So there's some caveats with it, but when you just look at the pharmacology, you look at the research on it and you look at all this other cool stuff that's been done, you know, by, by dietary interventions elsewhere in lifestyle interventions.

Speaker 4:          02:10:38       Then the cbd oil hits all of those, those pieces. So yeah, it's kind of amazing that that plant was illegal for so long and still isn't a lot of places and still it's federally and there's so many benefits to it in a non psychoactive benefits folks doesn't have anything to do with your mind. You know, you just want an excuse to goodheart, hard fucking loser. That really doesn't even get you high. Cbd is don't do a damn thing. It does apparently alleviate anxiety and some breaks, right? Yeah. How much oF that is anxiety is dependent or caused by inflammation? They just had some great studies that we're looking at a alterations in gut microbiome and inflammatory status and depression and anxiety. And it was basically if they shifted things such that the gut microbiome looked healthier, the depression anxiety basically disappeared and then, you know, it could shift the other way.

Speaker 4:          02:11:29       And it's interesting again where if you add something, so not everybody's going to change her diet and, and like I advocate for that and push and shove, but the reality is like our world, it's sent up and incentivized to not do that. Like the big junk food manufacturers they study how to make this stuff addictive. Like what's the laY's potato chip line, but you can't eat just one. You know? I was like, I'll take that thing to the bank all day long so you can ridicule people fat, shame, do all this stuff. But there's a reality that our modern world is set up to work exactly against our genetics. So what do we do then? Well, you could have something like cbd oil where you put it in a little bite of chocolate and the person has one or two times a day or whatever the dosing regimen is and maybe it puts their all sort of colitis and remission.

Speaker 4:          02:12:16       Maybe their depression is gone. And then maybe if we get them moving in a good direction and they don't feel like shit, then maybe we can say, okay, let's now get some diet changes in there. Let's get you going to bed earlier. If you are gonna, stay up and work. Put on some blue blockers so it doesn't mess with your sleep patterns as much, but it's a really accessible, inexpensive, a no risk proposition that could have some really huge benefits for people. Yeah. I think that what you said too, that this system is sort of set up to get people to eat these crappy foods and make them incredibly available and very difficult to pass up. And once you start eating them, you consume on a daily basis. Your body starts craving them. You get addicted to them. I was at the supermarket the other day and I was under the influence and I was always wandering through the aisles.

Speaker 4:          02:13:02       It was one of those weird moments where I went, is this always been like this? I was just looking at these cans of food. Everything's can write. And I was thinking this is all food, but it can last forever and like is not supposed to last forever. The whole idea is supposed to grow it. You take it out of the ground, it's alive, you eat it and then you're healthy. And then I was looking at this food that was like just filled with preservatives and canned and these packages and plastic bags of it. And I was like, this is so. It's so strange

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       that this is the prevalent food because it's so easy to store. It's so easy to ship. It's so easy to have for sale. You put a barcode on the package and you're good to go. But this is not really. I mean you can eat it, it's food kind of. Right? But it's not really food food. The real food is on the edges. The real food is where the vegetables are and where the meats are and where the eggs are. That stuff in the middle. And those aisles where he just sees bright colored cans, they would. It was so weird. It was like a little kid's toy store, right? Like, because I was high. So I was wandering through the aisle and I'm looking at all these different colors on it. This is so weird. It's like trying to draw me in with smiley faces on the cans and on the plastic bags. But it's, we, unless you're going to a really good natural food store, you're probably inundated with that stuff. If you go to the regular vons and just walked down the aisle, man, you're going to get hit with so much of this shit.

Speaker 1:          02:14:30       Right? And it, it's um, it's interesting because the folks that make these foods, they study neurophysiology, they study evolutionary biology, they study how to make things addictive. So it's, it's kind of funny. On the one hand were like the gatekeepers, the medical establishment. A lot of the media, if you talk about like this ancestral health template or what have you there, there's still a bunch of like pissing match and contention around that. Whereas the people who are making these foods addictive, they fully get it, but they're using it in such a way that they're like, okay, here's our predilection to eat more and move less. Here's how we're going to make that happen and we have these really interesting flavor combinations and different experiences and do, do you want to, do you want to run that, that video. So here's a really interesting example of this, um, where, you know, you could get bored of even a really tasty food, but then you can figure out a way to bypass this whole process.

Speaker 6:          02:15:31       Strategy works for now. And I resumed my epic ice cream.

Speaker 1:          02:15:38       Okay. So what, what's going on there? Is it Andrew Zimmerman? Uh, or no? Adam. Rick manned a man versus food he does. He's eating challenges and he's in this thing called the kitchen sink challenge. It's an eight pound ice cream sundae and I think anybody would, would say that an ice cream sundae is pretty tasty, you know, and it's hyper palatable like it would make you want to eat it. But what happens to him is he gets completely bogged down in this process and can't go on until he orders a plate of extra salty, extra crunchy french fries. So he's actually gagging on the ice cream. Can't go on, he's not going to win this thing and the way that he gets out of this situation is by eating more food. He would not have finished the sunday were it not for eating the french fries and so you have this situation where in are woven into our genetics is this process called palate fatigue where even if we have a really tasty food in front of us we will get bored of it and then we'll want something else and if you have that other thing that something else immediately available and it's different enough from the thing that you just got bored with, you can eat more in total and it's just so interesting.

Speaker 1:          02:16:50       Like he would have failed eating this ice cream sundae. We're just the sunday, but not only did he eat the sunday, he ate probably about 1500 calories of extra salty, extra crunchy french fries. How did he know that? Soon? Explained that to them. So if you go to professional eating websites, like people who go do these things where they like eat hot dogs and whatever. Yeah, competitive eater. There are pairings. So it's like, okay, so with hot dogs you need something like gummy bears because the hot dogs are salty and media new mommy, so you need something kind of sweet and fruity and light. And so there are all these pairings that you do. And so with ice cream, because it's cold, creamy, sweet, the perfect compliment to it is this salty, crunchy umami that you get out of the, uh, the french fries. That's fascinating.

Speaker 1:          02:17:40       You know, I've always found that if I'm eating, I'm eating something and it's really good, like a steak or something. And um, I, I'm stuffed even if I don't want any more of the steak. If I have fries and I taste those salty fries, I'll start eating more fries. Like I know I'm full, right? Am I stuffing my fat face with these stupid fries? It's, it's that novelty. And from an evolutionary biology perspective, it's great wiring. It's great engineering because we didn't have guaranteed food all the time. You know, like you had to eat when you could get it and then, you know, you might go a long period of time without having that food. But now we're in a situation where you have infinite variety, there's 50,000 different food items in an average supermarket is 10 or 11,000 new food type items that are released each year.

Speaker 1:          02:18:24       They're engineered to be hyper palatable to bypass the neuro regulation of appetite and it's super easy to just go fill up your pantry with a wide assortment of these things. So then you can do what, what he ended up doing here. You can eat one meal, you know, like man, a little sweet thing would be really good. So you have that sweet thing and then, gosh, a little salty crunchy would be nice. And so you have the salty, crunchy and you can just keep eating through this whole process. And it really makes most of the standard like dietetics recommendation of, you know, eat less, move more, everything in moderation. There's no moderation in that environment. It doesn't exist. It's a hookers and cocaine experience, you know, I mean, it's like these things spin the dopamine centers in the brain, they are addictive and, and, uh, and if we are surprised by that process at all or feel bad about it, it's kind of crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:19:17       Like it is not your fault if you find yourself in trapped in this world of hyper palatable foods. And I don't suggest that people just roll over and expose her belly to the world and let you know, let the world have its way with you. But understand what, what, why it's so difficult. Like you should not feel guilt. There shouldn't be any drama. There should be no morality around it. Like if we just understand this is your basic biological wiring and if you understand that and it's not your fault, but let's do something, then we can at least decouple ourselves from the emotionality and the drama and the guilt that we've had around this. And we can start making some changes. But so many times, the reason why I've heard from people that they peel out of some sort of a new way of eating or lifestyle is it they're motoring long.

Speaker 1:          02:20:03       They seem to be doing well and then they're like, the, they're just gone and then you talk to them and they're like, oh, it's just hard. It's like, yeah, it is hard. But it wasn't just that, it was hard. They usually start getting some sort of internal dialogue where, well, I suck. I must be weak. I can't do it. It's easier for that guy than it is for me. So they bail on it. And when I, when I started putting this kind of spin of this evolutionary biology and this neuro regulation of appetite into working with people, particularly people who had had difficulties with eating over the long haul and maybe like some, you know, we're relationships with food or what have you. There was like this light that went on there. Like, okay, so it's not my fault. I'm like, no man, it's not your fault.

Speaker 1:          02:20:42       We still need to do something and it's not necessarily going to be easy, but we can do this and if you aren't beating yourself up about the fact that this thing is a difficult process, then we're going to be able to get a lot further down the road. Are there any foods that when you do go off the rails, like say if you have a cheat day and you have a, oh my god man, eat a whole pizza and a bowl of spaghetti and some fucking ice cream. Is there any foods that can counter balance the damaging effects or the addictive properties? Because the worst thing you want to do is have a cheat day and go, oh, fuck it. I'm just going to be a slob right now to enjoy a cheat day. By the way, you know, it's, um, don't, you know, and I, I, um, so instead of calling it a cheat day, I usually just say, kick your heels up to whatever you want to do.

Speaker 1:          02:21:29       I've seen a little problem when people set it up and they're like, okay, saturdays are my cheat days. And then you start gearing up towards saturday, it's like a heroin user who get the box out and they flip it open and they're getting all their gear setup and that anticipatory process for most of these people is better than actually having the thing and that anticipatory process is getting the dopamine, you know, go on in the brain and it just gets you all wound up and do it. So ideally, you know, let's say people eat three days, three meals a day, seven days a week, it's 21 meals, let's just say 19 of those meals are pretty on point and two of them are kind of kick your heels up to whatever and do it whenever you want to do it. The caveat to that is are there things that are going to flip you out and you're not going to come back from it, you know? And it depends if it's really an individual thing. So it could be a heroine food out there as well. So my heroine food is a

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       sea salt and vinegar potato chips. Oh I love those. Yeah. Like kind of healthy though is vinegar is potatoes. Potatoes, salt, what's bad about them? Well, when you eat like a five pound bag of them, which I can do in the blink of an eye. Then how big is a five pound bag of potato chips are pretty goddamn. Lots of leaf seizures, but that would be a big site bag. Okay. Let let, let's say, let's say a 16 ounce bag of potato chips, but 16 ounce bag. What kind of a slob or you? That's crazy. That time slot, you know it's so, you know. Whereas my wife, she'll eat a little bit of potato chips but she's more of a sweets person whereas I'll have a little bit of dark chocolate, but literally a good brick of dark chocolate will sit in the cabinet for a month and I'll chip away at it.

Speaker 4:          02:23:13       A block here, a block there. But if we have potato chips in the house, I will eat all of them. I'm a dark chocolate and peanut butter dude. Okay. Yeah. Dipped in dark chocolate and peanut butter because you know you got your chocolate in my peanut butter. Remember those commercials and it tastes delicious. Guess what? Reese's peanut butter cups can't fuck with an actual candy bar and an actual peanut butter. That's way better. Right? Right. Fucked up with that. It's still a really good idea though. They shouldn't have. They shouldn't have done it. And that's why they stopped doing that commercial because people said [inaudible], I'm just going buy a chocolate bar and a big ass tub of peanut butter and have a party. Right. It's way better. It's way better. But you know, in that, that's an interesting to like thinking about the palatability thing, how much chocolate can you by itself, right?

Speaker 4:          02:23:56       How much peanut butter can eat by itself, but together together you can fuck them up. Yeah. Yeah. In ghirardelli's chocolate, like one of those big ass thick chocolate bars. Oh right. And, and it's, you know, for me, I'm not trying to moralize it or say this is right or that's wrong, but just being aware that like stacking those flavor combinations, like in general, if you can make your meals enjoyable but not over the top to the, to the point that you're, you're, you're overdoing it. And it's just different for everybody. You know, they have, that sounds like you're saying enjoy it, but don't enjoy it too much. That's pretty much it. It, yeah. But what about someone who wants to enjoy it? What about someone who wants to have that delicious taste of the sea salt and vinegar and the potato chips. What I recommend is generally you have that out of the house and you don't have it hanging out in your pantry because you go to the woods.

Speaker 4:          02:24:50       Like remember when we used to find porn, we're porn the woods. You to bring potato chips in the woods, eat them in a dangerous environment. So you're constantly looking over your shoulder for wolves and shit. Right. That's a good strategy. I was thinking more just kinda like go to the mini mart and you get it in your car. But yet that god made me feel like a real junk. And you're in a bad neighborhood shooting up in the parking lot. Oh yeah. So for you it's just that that's a. That seems like a good healthy heroin food though as far as like heroin foods. I mean it's just a potato, a root vegetable. But I mean you can really track blood sugar on it when you eat a bag of, you know, like the sea salt and vinegar, potato chips. My blood sugar was like diabetic levels.

Speaker 4:          02:25:30       So yeah, it's have weird dance. Yeah, I would like to check it. Yeah. That's squared away with a cgm if you want to do that. It's continuous blood glucose monitor. You put it on and it has it doing it, doing it through your skin. It's a little tiny hair, hair size probe that goes through the skin and then it samples the blood, the interstitial fluid once a minute for the duration that you have this thing on usually where two or three weeks. And. And uh, yeah I was using one of those ketone monitors where you have to cut yourself and then. But it doesn't make me bleed because I have too many cows. His hands. So it stick it in the fingers and my, my fingertip skin is too thick so I'd have to go to the side of my hand. it's fucking gross to like jab myself and the side and my fingers.

Speaker 4:          02:26:14       Right. They've got annoyed by it. This is pretty mellow. I was even able to roll with it. I just took some rock tape and put over it. Yeah, it's a, you know, like a 50 fifty cent piece kind of deal with low profile, flat rolled with it on your body. What if someone put you in like a bicep crusher on that arm? That would have sucked. That would have sucked. So yeah. So what we're doing tap out before it gets to that. That one did not come up during. Where do you put it? Usually right there. It's right where I'd get you look for that spot. I know he's got that thing on and real fucking attack that thing. That's so funny for me, man. It's linguine with clams. That's my heroine food. I love linguine with clams. Is there any benefit to having gluten free linguine versus regular linguine?

Speaker 4:          02:27:03       Definitely. If you're reactive to gluten then yeah, it seems to me just seems like my body processes it a little easier. Right. But it doesn't seem as satisfying either. Hm. Huh. And it's been prepped pretty much the same way. It's just like, it's a little less substantial. There's like, there's something about like real in gleaning from a good italian restaurant where has that aldente bite to it? Right. Hard to get that with gluten free pasta. I mean there's a, there's a textural element to it. There's clearly a flavor element to it. I'm gluten is just really interesting, like the type of protein that it is, it, this is why it makes pasta and pastries and everything so unique. Like we don't make pastries out of corn because it sucks as a medium like that for tortillas. So bad for tortillas, but You're not going to make like a sandwich out of it. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean you've got those flavor elements and then for some people they do get a little bit of an opiate response off of wheat. So for you, you have a tremendous intolerance to wheat, so you cannot fuck with that. But for the average person that doesn't have this tremendous intolerance, is there a benefit to eating sprouted bread over regular bread? I would say generally, yes. Based. Not necessarily nutrient, but potentially this inflammatory process. Yeah. And,

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       and again, the enzymes, the enzymes break down the gliadins and so in, in part it's just partially digested so it's easier to digest and absorb to the degree that there some problems with like glee, addon, wheat germ agglutinin those proteins get broken down. So I would say that there's a lower likelihood of those foods being proinflammatory. So if somebody's like, dude, I want a sandwich. Then doing the zika or bread and, and doing it on that to me would be a pretty good wing compared to doing like wonder bread. Now is there any nutritional properties? Are benefits to eating that bread? Is that, is there anything like you could say like I'm eating something good. The fact that it's a whole grain and it hasn't been super denuded and process, you're gonna have more b vitamins. You could have more mineral. So in general, like if we were to weigh out equally, you know, say 100 grams of this hundred grams of that.

Speaker 1:          02:29:12       There's gonna be more vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and the zucchini bread than in the white bread. Even though the white bread gets enriched with iron and some b vitamins, I would say that the bread is still probably a win. I never bought that enriched shit. Right. Rich flower. Like why enriching it? What are you doing? Because it's because without that then you get super, super sick. Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. Is that why they enrich it? Yeah. Because there were a nutrient deficiency diseases like, you know, 19 twenties, 19 thirties as, as we really started industrializing the food system and you know, and there's, there's a good argument for changing wheat flour to white flour when you remove that protein and fatty element that's in the whole wheat flour, it goes rancid much faster. So white flour is much more shelf stable. It lasts a lot and also it has a different flavor profile and everything's a little more mild.

Speaker 1:          02:30:05       But there's a good argument again, but you know, it's like that, that shelf stability thing, this is part of the hallmark of something that's maybe not a great option other than chicharrones teacher. Rene's could last a million years and they're still amazing. But uh, there is an exception to everything, but you know, there was economic and pallet incentives for why you would want to make this white flour. But it also, people started getting more nutrient deficiencies because the amount of b vitamins and whatnot that usually come in that whole grain where were gone. That makes sense. The zucchini bread is notoriously poor as far as like shelf life. Yeah. It gets moldy. Like almost immediately. Yeah. Yeah. Really building fridge and all that. That's one of the few breads that I always keep in the fridge. But. So it's not necessarily good for you though. It's better for you then say a process wheat bread, but it's not really good for you. I'm going to take those. No, I don't know. I mean that's a really good question. I've never really thought about it like that. You know, like is a blueberry good for you? You as a piece of steak? Good for you. Yeah. I don't know, like you again. So if we did a nutrient density kind of story and we looked that as equal brag

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       compared to good types of fruit, vegetables, squash, I think that the equal bread would look pretty skinny. Like if you had 100 calories of this versus 100 calories of these. But again, we looked at the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants that both of them had. I don't think the is eql bread would be a real rock star, but I bet it would be better than white rice. It would probably be as good or on par with something like lentils or something like that. Again, as far as vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, all that stuff. So that's weird to me because I would think that lentils would be vitamin rich. Not huge, but they're not terrible either. I mean it's just all this kind of relative thing. and you know, rhonda patrick is really good about this stuff. She's really geeked out on what are the most nutrient dense foods out there and trying to really make an emphasis of of eating those.

Speaker 4:          02:32:12       And so like sprouts tend to be at the topic list. And then interestingly, things like organ meats are super high up on the list and, and, and it starts kind of stratifying our herbs and spices tend to be off the richter high in nutrient density, but we tend to not eat a ton of them, but you know, like ginger and basil and garlic and all those things are really, really nutrient dense and they also seem to have medicinal qualities and antimicrobial quality. So there's some interesting stuff there, but, you know, at the end of the day, um, you know, you could, people do try to do it. It's like every meal is going to be blueberries and the, you know, wild caught deep water fish and you know, a mountain of greens in and god love you for doing that I guess. But you know, every meal does not have to be that way to be pretty damn healthy.

Speaker 4:          02:33:00       And, and you know all that. So that's where the is equal bread. I think that's probably not like a terrible. By no means is it a terrible option in the story. so it's not a terrible option, but it's not necessarily the most nutrient dense than you can eat. Right, right, right, right, right, right. Yeah. Now getting back to what I asked earlier, is there a food that you would recommend for a guy who did eat that one pound bag of potato chips? Is there anything or is it fasting maybe the best? Yes, that's the best option. Yeah. I mean something like that or just you know, some period of, of less intake and so, you know, but then that gets like, I hear people screaming like, you know, disordered eating now, you know, I was like, oh, it's food, you know, a, a, a eating disorder.

Speaker 4:          02:33:45       How does fasting considered an eating disorder? It's not eating and eating disorders seems to me to be like maybe so many bulemia start associating with low like anorexia it and potentially the bulemia dna. Sick people don't fast. That's what's, they just don't eat right. Um, well it's interesting again, like the, the only thing. So you could eat like a cockroach, like you could walk into a work environment or you know, like post your photos on instagram. About eating, having a big, big gulp and donuts and all this other fucked up stuff. And most dietitians won't really bat an eye at that. They're like, yeah, you should eat better, but they're not gonna say anything. But if you post some stuff about a low carb paleo kind of look and deal than you're a disorder dieter. Or if you eat gluten free, then they call it disordered eating.

Speaker 4:          02:34:34       Intermittent fasting is being called disordered eating. But, but who is it being called it by generally like the dietetics, healthcare, you know, kind of mainstream. Like I get a sale by these people all the time. And the intermittent fasting thing is really fascinating because again, for just a very brief historical step back, it's like, have humans always had three meals a day and most people don't even eat just three meals a day. They just eat all day long, you know? And, and, uh, and there some clear problems with that from an implementation standpoint. They've done some studies where they had people eat a caloric restricted diet, which should be anti inflammatory, but the one group of calorie restricted folks eat consistently throughout the day and they don't get that antiinflammatory benefit because they're just constantly keeping their digestive system going and all that type of stuff. So, you know, there's some really, really strong evidence and suggestion that some sort of punctuated eating pattern would be really healthy, but it, it's, uh, it's, uh, it, it, it's interesting.

Speaker 4:          02:35:38       On the one hand, it's being really aggressively researched in the kind of cutting edge, uh, communities like rhonda, Patrick valter, longo, dom talks about this stuff a lot, but then when you get into kind of thiS mainstream dietetics story, they're just freaked out by this stuff. Like they really can't wrap their heads saying people probably aren't even freaked out about those lap bands. Those. Right. This is disgusting bands that they put around people's stomachs. What do they call them? Black bands, right? Yeah. I saw some guy arguing for a vegan diet and then I found out that he was a surgeon that performed stomach shrinking operations. Yeah, yeah. Uh, yeah, yeah, like what the fUck band are you trying to get people healthy? Are you just trying to make money? Right. That's great. We'll with some Folks is the only option bullshit. It's never the only option.

Speaker 4:          02:36:28       Does your mouth work? Do your hands. Where Can you put food in your mouth? Then? It's not the only option to and disempowering people or saying that it's the only option for some folks to get them healthy. That is insanity. You are coddling them to the point of you're, you're willing to diminish their, their overall physical structure of their digestive system. I mean, that's what you're doing, right? I've read some horrendous things about the consequences of these stomach mineralization, uh, activities or the surgeries rather. It's really scary stuff. You have to completely limit what you eat from now on. Your stomach is about the size of my fist. Now it's this little tiny thing and you get full quicker. So that's the psychological mechanism behind it. You get full quicker and, but, uh, the rabbit. So the interesting thing is almost immediately when people undergo these procedures, if they were like a type two diabetic, like they come out of it and they're no longer a type two diabetic, almost immediately, like it's really, really interesting.

Speaker 4:          02:37:30       So there's that upside. But then also the longterm, you know, two years, three years, four years, almost inevitably they get themselves back into the situation they were in. And part of what's interesting is because they have such a small stomach, they can't hardly eat anything. So there's a tendency towards eating more refined food because that, that's, you know, they, they just can't eat that much. So it's um, I know a guy broke his out. Oh really? Oh wow. He got a stomach shrunk, got an operation. She's a big fat guy and got a stomach cut and then broke it out and had to go and get a second surgery. YeaH, it's a, that's where I'm very glad I didn't go into medicine specifically. Like that's just such a quagmire. I would probably shoot myself being in it. Get infuriated when someone says that that's the only option.

Speaker 4:          02:38:19       For some people that is not true. That is just absolutely not true. There are always options if you have willpower of you, have a mind. If you have a support system, if you have people that can coach you, if you're willing to listen, if you're willing to understand and believe the consequences of your actions, you can change your diet and your behavior. You can, and it doesn't matter if you're 600 pounds or 60 pounds overweight, 86 pounds overweight, you can make changes. it, it's interesting because insurance will reimburse for these like lap band, gastric bypass surgeries and they're 30, $40,000 to, to pump people through it, but it's really difficult to get them to reimburse like a gym membership, a health coach, you know, that type of stuff. Which, which um, well it's got to be some collusion between the healthcare providers and the medical industry.

Speaker 4:          02:39:03       I mean, just to dylan, that's the only thing that makes sense or that people demand it so much so they can't deny it from people. Right. It's just very, very frustrating for me when you tell people that they don't have any other options and that this is the best options to cut you open and cut your stomach and stitch it back to a smaller version of it. Didn't have what it is. Well, it end. Did you see that thing wheRe they now have a stomach pump where you can, they, they basically put a tube in there, you can eat the food and then pump the food out of the stomach and this thing is awaiting fda approval. So they stay in roman times. This is where like, you know, the, the, uh, uh, bread and circus just keep everybody entertained and that old, the whole thing collapses. But they used to have the vomitorium where people would eat. Do you know tHat? That's not true. Really? Yeah. Not only is it not true vomitorium doesn't mean that we. What vomitorium means, it's the entrance and exit to an arena. The volley. Yes. This is something that I've gone into in great detail and I went to the colosseum in rome and they explained the vomitorium and it's just a misdemeanor. You're crushing. My head shouldn't be saying that this is crushing. My whole, like rome

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       fell work in a fall. These guys used to throw up and now we're doing it. They may have done that. They may have thrown up, but it wasn't that a vomitorium vomitorium is here. Pull it up jamie. So he could see what a vomitorium is. What a vomitorium is, is the actual structure of an arena like where the people come out and go through this area and it has nothing to do with the word vomit. Okay. How am I going to tell them? My post apocalyptic story about rome got fucked heading. That sort of vomitorium is okay, but how do I tell the fucked up? You should have googled it, man. dude, you should've done a. We did. You fucked up. You tried to pass away some some bullshit man up. So chagrined. But. But it's important because I read a lot of people telling me that and educated people like yourself have said that it's just not true.

Speaker 2:          02:41:01       Okay. That's what a go back to that image of assist. Yeah. This, these vomitorium exist in every arena. That's what they are. The stairways come down and then that opening at the bottom of the stairway, that is a vomitorium, but what is the origin of the word? Now? They threw up, they threw up. A few of them did really rich people. They wanted to eat and keep eating. They threw up, but that's not what it is. Like go larger please. So I can see that his series of interest is or exit pastures in ancient roman amphitheater or theater. A place where which according to popular misconception, the ancient romans were supposed to have vomited during fees to make room for more food. Not true. THere you go. Damn. Sorry dude. Oh man. It's important that you know about it that I am properly chagrin thing.

Speaker 2:          02:41:44       Yeah. It's just one of those things that people repeat and then they never bothered looking it up. Um, would that pump though? Go back to that fucking disgusting stomach pump. This is so nasty. So this is a high. I'm fat and my brain is stupid and I just love to eat so I can eat now and yay. Eat normal healthy meals. Hey, that girl in the middle is triggered, I can tell, and then you stick this pump through a fucking hole in your belly button and it sucks out the food because nothing could go wrong. Look at that. Look at her for honey. Go outside, go running. Stop. Look at me. I put the food in my mouth and it sends a signal to my brain. It's a simple procedure. Low risk, completely reversible. Takes just 15 minutes. How about fuck you? Twilight sedation back in home and just a couple of hours.

Speaker 2:          02:42:37       Look at that cartoon, the cartoon people like that girl needs it. That girl's hot as fuck. She's skinny. Even cartoon hot. This is ridiculous. You don't need it, honey. Stop. Well, I think this is her afterwards. Oh, that's her. This is all these people that have shrunk down from having. When I go back to that, go back to that. Here's the thing folks, all you people that have benefited from it, you could do another thing. You could just change your diet and one of the most powerful benefits of the key to genic died. His appetite suppression and that appetite suppression is fantastic. It's amazing. Even for a person like me who's never really struggled with their weight, I find that going without food is not only is it easy, but it's really inconsequential. It's not an issue at all. I can go without for five, six hours, you know, it doesn't bother me at all.

Speaker 1:          02:43:27       Yeah. It's um, it's super liberating and you know, the tooth, it's powerful as it is. It can also be where people get themselves in trouble. A lot of the problems that are ascribed to just low carb I think is an outgrowth of it being so satiating that you under eat. So if you are hypo caloric for too often, too long, the net can be a big problem. I don't have issues with that. I eat like a pig, but. Right.

Speaker 2:          02:43:54       Um, but I've definitely lost weight by changing my diet to that ketogenic diet. And I've met so many people on the roads. So many people want a mountain about that come up to me and they say, thank you. I've lost 60 pounds. Thank you. I've lost 80 pounds. Thank you. I've changed my diet, I drink kale shakes in the morning, and now my body is just a completely different thing and it just feels different. It works better. So important, man. It's just so important to take care of this meat vehicle that you're driving around. It's so many people are falling prey to that supermarket line of cans with shiny colors on the labels and you get roped into this idea that just because you put it in your mouth, it's food and your body is just sludge. It's just slugged down with all this nonsense

Speaker 1:          02:44:39       in a ketogenic diet is interesting. Some people that seem to never really be able to get anything else to work. It's possible they may have some damage to the hypothalamus, the energy regulating centers of the brain. It's unclear what's going on, but we we know that a key to genic diet, it has some really great benefits for neurological conditions in general like epilepsy. Some parkinson's alzheimer's research that's going on and conditions are conditions, but it's possible that these ketones may be altering to the physiology of the hypothalamus in such a way that we get normal energy regulation of metabolism and appetite. More importantly, cognitive benefits as well. It's another thing when people don't have that lazy, foggy feeling after meals,

Speaker 2:          02:45:24       right, and that foggy feeling is pretty substantial and really important. If you're someone who has to think for a living that's hopefully is most most people hopefully I think in some way, but you know your brain running on ketones, that's the one of the things that people are always scared about. Like, oh man, your. Your brain runs on sugar. Sugar.

Speaker 1:          02:45:43       You need glucose to run your brain. That's not really true. Right? Right. In again, like 70, 80 percent of the brain tends to shift to just ketone body metabolism. When you're fully keto adapted, there's still some of the brain that's going to run on glucose. There's some red blood cells that are going to run on glucose, but the. The interesting thing though is that you just have. If you just look at blood glucose over time, there's a pretty cool

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       a guy went on a medically supervised fast for 382 days and you look at his blood glucose levels and is beta hydroxybutyrate levels and whatnot. Do that. He just drank water. He drank water, had some electrolytes. Day 382 days stay alive. I don't even understand the fat. What that was. This guy that. Yeah, it should have a picture of the guy when he, when you track it down, if it was over 400 pounds, he went from over 400, I think, close to 500 pounds. Down to 180 pounds. I think he finished off like 180 pounds. Guy didn't eat for 382 days. Didn't poop for almost two months. Whoa. He fat. Hold on. He fasted for over a year and somehow lived. How far can you go without risking your health? Whoa. Is there a before and after photos of this gentleman? This is it. It was, um, if you go to this and just go to, um, the images, then you'll probably see like a, a yeah, go to images and then we'll have something with the beta hydroxy. I'm not seeing it. Huh? That's incredible. Imagine if you knew this guy and you didn't see him for a year. Could you throw ketosis in there also?

Speaker 7:          02:47:26       S

Speaker 4:          02:47:27       amazing if you did a fifth one over that. Yep. Nope, that one right there. Yep. So blood glucose, free fatty acids and ketone body levels during his fast. So his blood glucose, that second from the top line, the triangles that dropped and then was just rock solid beta hydroxybutyrate, which is that, that, um, the main ketone body that, that gets used as a fuel substrate that goes up to a pretty high level higher than what you would get under a nutritional ketosis typically because this is a starvation deal. Free fatty acids elevate a cdot acetate, elevates a cdot acetate, kind of interconvert to with the beta hydroxy butyrate. But what's interesting to your point about the mental state, if we were graphing someone's blood glucose over time for this period of 40 days and they were eating normal mixed meals, that thing would be seesawing all over the place, understand how he has any glucose because gluconeogenesis in the liver, so he's he even eating a hunter like absolutely no carbohydrate at all.

Speaker 4:          02:48:34       There was a glycerol backbone of fat that can get converted into glucose and then also certain amino acids which are gluconeogenic can get converted into glucose and so the body will use those because we still need like just making dna, the pentose phosphate pathway. We need some glucose to be able to do that. So like cellular replication and whatnot. But you can do that with effectively no carb. So without dietary glucose, the body converts fat to glucose, some of the backbone of fat, the glycerol part, and then also proteins. Yeah, but with this guy, it's not even proteins unless his body's eating his meat, which they probably did to some degree, but this is part of the benefit of ketosis is that it really reduces the breakdown of lean body mass, but if you think about it like there are people who end up with these huge, you know, folds of skin that need to get it surgically removed.

Speaker 4:          02:49:28       There was a pretty good argument that had they used a fasting protocol instead of like a low fat higher protein protocol. If that protein is still being supplied in the diet, then even though the fat goes away, you still have the protein matrix of the skin and the interstitial. A connective tissue that isn't going to go away, but when we're more in that fasted state or intermittent fasting or maybe ketosis, the body is turning over that protein base and that's really important. That's this apoptotic process, but you could potentially have a scenario where people who are losing a lot of weight if they use these fasting protocols, aren't going to need that cosmetic surgery at the end to get rid of these sales. Of. Of skin, is that possible? Is that really possible? Yeah, but has anyone done it? I mean, it's anecdotal at this point, so if they've done this, why don't they do well, what happened to this gentleman?

Speaker 4:          02:50:21       Well, this guy looked totally normal. That's the thing. I mean he was huge and then it looked totally normal. You didn't have ridiculous lose fat, right? Flying squirrels skin. Right. Whereas like a lot of the people that you saw in like the biggest loser, like they, they had that stuff and they were using a higher carb, moderate protein kind of deal. Sorry to interrupt. Does your body have the ability to understand that the skin that's hanging loose is not necessarily. Yes. Yeah. Just kind of mechanical receptors. This piezoelectric effect effective feedback of all that. Yeah. What about people that have lost all the weight in another fashion and now they've gotten to them themselves into this really thin body with all this extra skin? Could they go on a fasting protocol then and would the body absorb that skin tissue first before it started eating up the muscle tissue height?

Speaker 4:          02:51:09       Possibly, but the challenge with that is it because they've already decrease their fat mass, like are they now leading this into an unhealthy state? So what, what if they decided, let me fatten up again, like maybe the move would be to fatten up again and get yourself obese again and then go on this. I meAn you're laughing, but honestly wouldn't that be the move to get yourself fat again and then going on a fasting like this guy's monitoring medical medically monitored fasting and then your body would absorb the fat again and the skin tissue. Maybe I would. Maybe. It's interesting. I would have never thought about doing that. I would maybe think about like two or three days a week of fasting, so some intermittent fasting and then you get into some normal eating and then even what you could do is you could go a two or three days of fasting or a very low calorie intake and then at the end of that period you could just be very low protein and then maybe four out of the five days, four out of seven days your low protein and two or three of those days you're super low calorie.

Speaker 4:          02:52:17       What have you tried that and it didn't work. You still got that floppy skin. Then it would suck. You'd be driving and this guy might have it nailed. Yeah, yeah. Fuck, you got to get fat again. Folks, don't get the surgery. Just get fat again. Don't say that to people though. It's hard to say because nobody wants to do that because it's so hard to lose that weight. Right? Once you lost that kind of so, but when people do get that operation, when they cut their skin and it's really dangerous, super dangerous. There's a high risk of infection, a high bleeding. Yeah, yeah, I mean it's horrendous. Yeah. It doesn't. Usually finnish guy who got attacked with a knife or something, you know, covered in these das of sorts. Yeah, yeah. Score, score scars or either you have a book out. Yeah. Yeah. That's the book wired to eat.

Speaker 4:          02:53:03       Was it about. It's about the neuro regulation of appetite. Oh, well we've been talking about a bunch of it. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean a bunch of the stuff like the uh, the ice cream deal, like I talk about that stuff in the book. Um, it's, you know, it's steeped in this evolutionary medicine perspective, but I'm really, if I'm effective with this, I'm really trying to decouple people are like unpack all the emotionality that they've got around food. Like if they've found challenges around changing their diet and lifestyle, it shouldn't be a surprise and it's not their fault, but at the same time I don't want them to just roll over and give up. Like we, we've got ways to move them through a process of discovering what works for them, what doesn't work for them and we can move her forward. But I would say like 50, 60 percent of the people that end up failing in this process, it's kind of emotional baggage type stuff and also there's this sense.

Speaker 4:          02:53:54       So when people are at jujitsu and they're like, man, this shit's really hard. It's like, yeah, if you want to keep doing it then do it. But it's, it's hard. It's always hard. And similarly, doing diet and lifestyle changes frequently is pretty difficult. And so if you can just understand that and understand that that's normal and you're not beating yourself up about that process, that we really stand a much better chance of turning that corner and making these effective, longstanding changes. All right, so the book is out right now, right now. Rob wolf. Then get it to amazon. I'll anywhere books are sold. Yep. Yep. Alright dude. Well thank you very much for being here. Thank you for having great, sweet robb wolf, ladies and gentlemen. All right, this show's over. Go do something else. Bye. Love you.
