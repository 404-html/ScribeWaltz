Speaker 1:          00:00          All right, let me just have this dense thick heel scan that curls over on each side like a human flip flop. You could hide a q tip from where the, the ankles, the calves go into the ankle if you can just tuck one in there and not even see it. We were talking about that too. The thing that you least have a sympathy for someone who's overweight. You know, I, I sympathize with people who have glandular problems, but if you're just a fat fuck, glutton ising all day, uh, if you're a fucking faggot shit, say that again. Have you ever fucked a fat chick? I'm going to give you a second chance. I'm sure. Sure. I blocked it out.

Speaker 2:          00:41          No, that actually is a little bit like, hey, it's more chick and it actually, you know, you get sweaty ingredients like you're fucking more woman. And I kind of enjoyed it was different. Do you feel more comfortable with your body too? Because you look, listen, bitch, you know, you're, you know, I didn't think of it that way. It was kind of like, oh, there's skin and boobs everywhere and ass everywhere. You ever feel uncomfortable about any one of these folds in her stomach? It was just weird, like I don't want to do it again, but it was definitely interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Who was it that told us that only fucks with a shirt on? Was it already? Probably Duncan. I don't remember. Whatever. I guess if you were, if you were banging. I don't think it's all right. I think. I think I'm incorrect. If you're banging, it might've been Louie ck.

Speaker 2:          01:27          Oh, that I can see that now.

Speaker 1:          01:29          I think he actually has a bid on it actually. I'm pretty sure that's it. Yeah, I think Louis has a bid on it. Um, you know, if you're, if you're fucking offend, check like you can like loosen up, you know, if you're banging like some super hot alpha female with perfect shape. Like why is she even lend me? Fuck her. This is ridiculous. Like I'm not even worthy. But if it's a faculty like bitching, good as you can make fun of. Yeah. There's definitely. I mean, in culturally, you know, there's some, there's some cultures that still, there's a lot of dudes who like, I'm fat that like I have a friend who likes girls and he always jokes around Sam Aaa. He jokes about it, he likes them thick, he likes something. He goes, I like a thick girl. It was just like say it out loud, like a big, like a big ass, you know. And he's hilarious about it. That's what he likes, man. That's his type of woman always has been and he's not faking it. That's what he likes, you know, everybody's got their own thing. So that's a, that's a fucking a weird thing. Like when someone's got a little little twist, a little twist and what they're attracted to go to fucking look a long foot, big foot, don't want a wide foot. But I look a girl with the long foot. Yeah, yeah. I

Speaker 2:          02:40          have friends who will look at a girl's feet almost first and they'll be like, oh no, no, look at her. She's got like a size 10, you know, and they'll just be out. So the big theater bat or like weird toes, like with week chins and weak eyebrows. If a girl is a weak chin or a week either. Really Small Chins are disturbing. Disturbing.

Speaker 1:          03:00          I don't like it. There's something. Something wrong with you genetically. Like if you're really missing a check because he reminds me of like a frog or something. It's odd. It's an oddity like why is your lower jaw so small or do you not have to chew things? The more evolved than me. Are you in the next stage where we're gonna be eating liquid fruit,

Speaker 2:          03:18          blow that out and do a bubble and make a nice song from your mouth.

Speaker 1:          03:22          What is that? Is that evolution? And they more evolved than us.

Speaker 2:          03:26          I don't know. But what's up? And also eyebrows. I don't know about you browse bugged, bugging when chicks have like really like drawn on eyebrows or like just, you know, no eyebrow it all. It's just, it bugs the fuck out.

Speaker 1:          03:38          Why did chicks trim their eyebrows? We don't give a fuck. They don't even know if a girl has big, bushy eyebrows. We don't give a fuck. I just got to take care of in the Middle Brow, but you know what, if a girl is really hot and she's got a uni brow, who gives a fuck? I can tolerate a uni brow. Yeah. You just pretend she some crazy Israeli bitch that just got out of the secret service over there, over here spying on you. But she falls in love and you're banging. I don't think any brand would bother me at all. Man. Hairy legs are tripped up facial hair. The girl, when I was really young, uh, who was, uh, um, she was going to an all girls school. She's going to an all girls college and her and her friends wouldn't shave their legs. They were like super feminist hippie checks and this just did not work out.

Speaker 1:          04:27          The conversations that we had where it was like, they, they went to this completely all girl school that was like super, like super ultra liberal, ultra socialist ideals and the view of the world was very strange and they wouldn't shave. Why should women have to shave? Shave? Like how about we both shaved? If the only way to get you to shave is that I have the shale. I'll fucking shave. I don't mind having shaved legs. I think it's weird, but I'll do it if you'll do it. I can't fuck you. Hobbit lady. You got hair on your feet. You know, that's just the trip man. Yeah. Girls don't be having here on your feet. Please stop that. But that's been. I mean this female's shaving has been going on for thousands of years. Right? But what is the reason for that? Is there an evolutionary reason? Why are we so much more attracted to less hair and why his hair disgusting to us. Is it a hygiene thing for pussy? Right? It must be a hygiene thing, right? Like you got all that crazy here. I don't know if you, you, you don't even know what the fuck is in there. You don't know what's cleaner. Visual creatures too. So at the. But some guys like hairy pussies,

Speaker 2:          05:31          hairy pussies on the comeback. I mean Harry is very 2010, so Ayesha Gray and some of these girls and they're, they're rocking it. They got the bus, but they cut it off right at the top, you know, I mean they don't go all the way through to the.

Speaker 1:          05:43          So the little top Bush, but they don't hair butthole Bush go. Yeah. So what do they do? They wax around all that laser and laser just keep a landing patch or tweezed whole triangle. Is that

Speaker 3:          05:58          like a defiance thing? Like I'm going to redefine my sexuality. I think it's just that people get so accustomed. The one thing that the new is hot, probably it'll go in 10 years. So gray fascinates me

Speaker 1:          06:09          and one of the reasons why she fascinates me is because she's like the girl that like somehow or another is I'm free of the porn and more into moral like of mainstream [inaudible] people's, you know, people's thoughts. You know what I'm saying? Like she's not just thought, she's like, she's like elevated, she's left the just the total porn world. And she's permeated regular pop culture. You know? And it's strange when something like that happens, like how does one do that? You know, there's always like, there's people that are like super successful at something like Lance Armstrong, boom, there's the guy, he's the guy rides the bike, you know, and Jenna Jameson, there's the super porn star, you know, she's the one and then there was a few that get through the traci lords that get through and then other people know about them, you know. But Sasha gray is one, she's a unique one.

Speaker 3:          06:58          She is. And it's interesting because she's on the very hardcore side of, of, of the business too. I mean she's no holds barred. I mean she, whatever, whatever she's down with and she. But she kinda does it in a way where she's like, I want to explore all of the sides of sexuality, including the dark side. So she kinda has owned it from the beginning. I think at that. That's made it better. You don't feel like Sasha, you know, our poor Sasha, you like Sasha was doing what she wants to do and she's doing it on camera. So that I think has helped her out a lot and then she got a big break with that. Uh, Steven Soderbergh film. Did you see that as, as a little tough to watch the whole thing? But it was, it was cool. I would, yeah, I would have liked it as a short movie, you know, like she reluctant to say it.

Speaker 3:          07:43          So I do know Sasha, you know, some of these girls will, she was an awesome actor, will look what you had to work with. Well it was a cool feeling, you know, but you can't drag that on for an hour and a half. It's what's the cool feeling? What is the movie about? It's kind of this very dark kind of artistic, you know, analysis of a, of a call girl, you know, and how that interaction is. But it could have been done with one scene. Like you get it, you get, you get the feeling you get how this interaction goes. So in the girlfriend experience, is she providing like an intimate call girl experience that it's like having a girlfriend? Is that promises? Exactly. I saw like two minutes of it once on television about right. Really minutes was the last to talk to this guy and hugging him and then they cut the black and I was like, what the fuck is that? Just kind of a snippet that lasts a little bit too long. That's a fucking strange thing, man. You ever have a buddy that's in love with a prostitute? I've had guys fall in love with a stripper. The t pains. Well, I had a friend who was in love with a prostitute. He was a guy used to play pool with a very nice guy, but he was unfortunate looking and uh, he did not do very well with the ladies

Speaker 1:          08:52          and he would go to this massage parlor and get jerked off by this one and a, it was like one of those creepy massage parlors, you know, like it wasn't really a massage parlor and like, you know, they like rub your back and then just go, what's up? Pull your Dick out, let's do this. And uh, he wanted to ask her out to dinner outside and she wouldn't go out with them. And he was trying to figure out like he's asking me what I should do at the magic words are, what should I do to get her to come out with me? I really would like to see her outside of the club. And I was like, Oh, you're on your own. So the threads like that, there's so many things wrong with what you're trying to do.

Speaker 1:          09:33          I mean, yeah. Okay. Well, okay, what happens then? You become boyfriend and girlfriend and she agrees, looks and no more in the mouth. Only hand jobs from now on. Like do you guys, do you come to an agreement or just accept the fact that this is what she does at work? That's work for her. That's tough. Strange, right? It's strange that we're so. It's so genetically attached. We're so genetically attached to control each other. Sexuality. You know, you could have a wife that was a massage therapist and she could be a great deep tissues. She'll let her, let her rub your Bob. Really, your wife's going to rub me. She could've rubbed me with oil all over my back. And am I going to grown while she's rubbing me? I'm going to go, oh yeah. Uh, so good. And you're going to be cool with that. Yeah. It's okay because it's just rubbing your back. But if she rubs your Dick and you make those same noises, I mean, basically she's doing the same thing. She just massaging you, but it just feels way better, but it feels too good. Too much. Too much. You're going to get psychologically attached to her rubbing on your deck. You can't do that. We draw the line.

Speaker 3:          10:37          It's a funny. It's a funny paradigm and it's certainly always been one sided. I mean,

Speaker 1:          10:41          I wouldn't even want to check who does massages. Yeah. I would feel creeped out. I get a bunch of my buddies come over and, and massage. I'm like, what could you imagine if you had a check that was doing massages and you're really into. And then one of your buddies started getting massages from her. I can't, Bro. What the fuck? What are you doing? And they have a nice eight ladies and give them a hug. Thank you so much for the big tip. Please. You're the best. I'm not the best. He's the best. He kill me. I can't wait for the next one. When's our next one? When's the next one? When we doing this again, stop and you're like, Hey, what are you guys fucking like? What's going on over here? Goddammit, you're causing pleasure with your hands and rubbing his ass cheeks. What's up? What's up? It's interesting because you have those, those conversations like would you tell me if mark got a hard on while you were massaged them? What are you saying? Stop it.

Speaker 4:          11:34          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          11:35          There's a real distinction for me. I mean, and there's some people who won't let their girls get a massage like I have. Yeah, for sure. You know what I mean? They won't let them get a massage from another male Zeus, you know, and that's some Taliban type shit, but you know, and then it just as a whole variety of different, you know, different levels of what people are comfortable with, you know, that's fucking seen you naked and robin. But yeah, it's good to look at your booth. Yeah, for sure. For sure. I mean it's, it's an interesting paradigm. I mean, for me, I think I wouldn't, we have, you know, me and my girl have a very, like very open, honest, you know, relationship and she killed him. He was like, don't respect, we respect each other's ability to just want to go out and experience things. But Chris, Marcus's Tampax is brought to you by the fleshlight. Please continue with it. But there would be, there's a, there's a real hard line between like that. Like I could, you know, I'm totally cool with her getting massaged and even in like some perfect circumstance where there was some unit who needed to manually get her off at some point. I think I would be cool with that. But at no point, well you know, whatever they're doing, they don't exist anymore,

Speaker 1:          12:51          be cool with. But do they still exist? They should chop your balls off.

Speaker 3:          12:56          Some situation where it was very mechanical. She goes in for a service he mechanically gets right. But at the point where it's like he's lusting and she's lost a mare. That's when the, that's when the board, that's where the fucking hard line is Bloomberg at about it. And they'll last just physical. Yeah, no, it's for me. I can make the connection. It's the same as rubbing the back or doing something like that is the same as you

Speaker 1:          13:21          to jerk off salon. Go there. Just some girl just rubs your balls that hot oil and jerks you off and that's it. Nothing. Nothing was going on. She kind of fairly mechanical. Thank you. That was great. That was awesome. I got rid of that. Not like you go out and talk about your childhood and I don't even know my dad. Oh my God. I don't know my dad either. That's where they've seen. No, your hands laying in the field looking up at the stars. Fuck all that, man. That's just bullshit. They're good guys. The real question is going to be what happens when we create artificial people and fuck them and are people even going to bother with relationships? That's the real question. You are on the brink of this with this flashlight thing because now you guys are the first people that have created an effective artificial vagina.

Speaker 1:          14:14          All those other ones are bullshit. All those blow up dolls. Those are for Bachelor Party gag gift bags. All right. Those are silly. Nobody really fucks blow up dolls. If you do, it's not good. You're better off jerking off. You might fuck one once, but they're not good. Yup. You guys have engineered a true artificial vagina, but this is just step one. Remember when tvs, when you go over your grandfather's house and the TV was this big giant ass fucking cabinet and the TV itself was only like 11 inches across and you need this fucking monstrous piece of furniture with tubes and shit. The bag of wires and memory, sometimes sparks would come out the back and you'd have to open up that there was a particle board back to it and you unscrew it and pull it back and look inside the bowels of this fucking beast. Now look at it. You can watch your little iphone slips in your pocket, man, and it's way higher resolution. So much better. Much better experience watching a movie on your iphone than it is one of those stupid tvs or an I pad. Jesus Christ. Yeah, the ipad of the fake pussies coming.

Speaker 3:          15:16          Hopefully. Uh, hopefully. Flashlight will be the ones. Do you think. So are you guys working with genetic engineers? Are you on the cusp of nanotechnology? Well, you know what I mean? All of that. That's kind of. Yeah, a golden goose. Like the more realistic you can get it interactive, you know, like fully people have tried to do it but no one's done it well yet. So obviously we're looking into it. I mean things have to evolve. I mean a flashlight looking into robotics. Yeah. Well to a certain one. Robotics just said just leave it. Yeah, I mean I don't want to get too much into it, but we've certainly explored all those different things. Even making it so that they can register your performance so you could almost, you know, log in and see your performance is compared to somebody else on your machine courts. How do you register? You have high scores like high score. You are devaluing the personal experience too. You're taking it too far, man. Two thousand strokes shouldn't be like three. This is a, you're not fucking a person who is trying to make feel good. You're trying to shoot him

Speaker 1:          16:13          load. I, if I do this 10 times that I'm like, why is it taking so long?

Speaker 2:          16:19          You know, you should have, you should have like fleshlight pants for gay guys that like the, there's like a thing like that. The end of the fleshlight. So it goes on. They're assholes. When other guys fuck the other guy. It feels better. You know, like it. Like it feels like a pussy adapter for another guy's asshole.

Speaker 3:          16:35          How do you know that? They don't like the feeling of guys. Assholes. I don't know. I'm just saying mix it up a little bit. They only have one type dude is fucking you in the buddy's fucking you in the butt. All right. This is kind of a filter for that. Something rather disturbing is that actually happened except uh, the guy just put the fleshlight straight in his butt. Oh really? I didn't see that. But our flesh Jack team informed me there was a video. This video is a video. Guys stuffed the flashlight up his button and another guy fucked the flush side. Would that, would that make you gay? I'm not sure about that if you do fish in the but it's gay. Listen, if you. Yeah, but I'm saying if a guy fucks you, your flashlight. Okay. See if you stuck a flashlight up your ass that's gay. Or if the guy fucks your flashlight, it's touching. Is he getting at what you're saying? Can you just fucking a rubber vagina? It's gay. If you're somehow touching a guy getting okay, what if you don't touch them? What if you just assume like a high mountain guide? Spread your legs apart. He keeps his legs closed. Want me to say no for a reason was the queer queer?

Speaker 3:          17:50          That would be weird. You know, one of our most popular selling units, it's called the stamina training unit though this. Well, the concept is basically that your hand doesn't feel anything like posting, so it doesn't prepare you to have sex. So there's a lot of anxiety, performance anxiety, people who don't last long enough to last longer. So you know, we've been able to give them a product that's very like highly sensitive inner canal so they can use it and get a little bit more prepared. And sensitize the people love it. Like we get feedback like, man, thank you so much. You know, like, I've always had problems with this, but now I've gotten a lot better.

Speaker 1:          18:23          Yeah. The first time you actually stick your dick inside a vagina. Oh yeah. I remember the first time I had sex. I came in one second. I came in one second. I stuck at it. I pulled it out and there was just loads everywhere. Oh my God. I barely made it. Barely made. Have no idea what that's going to feel like. The first time I blew a load I was in shock. I didn't even know that I wasn't. Nobody told me Shit. All right. No, my parents didn't tell me anything. And when I was a, I guess I was like 14 or 15, 15. My girlfriend blooming and I busted one in her mouth and my ears rang and I was like, what the hell was that? Like, I couldn't believe that. Like stuff comes out of you. Like you could feel it come on.

Speaker 1:          19:06          And you're like, whoa. Oh, that's what I've been building up to it. Yeah. I didn't know that there was even an orgasm thing. I recall it being like a 32nd or different. A ridiculous amount that's fucking ears rang for the first time I came, my ears rang. They haven't ranked sense. Wow. Because I never gave myself a day one day off since. No, I did one time for my website. No, it was like 30 days or something like that. I tried to do. But yeah, you, you, you know, you never recaptured. It's like they say with heroin addicts the first time they shoot heroin, it's just insanely beautiful experience. And from then on you're chasing the Dragon Dragon here. Yeah. You know that expression? Yeah. What is that? The first load you blow. So like it's good as it gets. Kids love it, enjoy it. But the experience is so rough that it's terrible.

Speaker 3:          19:55          I mean, you're just nervous. I remember, man, I remember the first time I'm trying to figure out how to use this condom and I'm going into the bathroom and I'm just like, it's not working. Right. And she's in the bed and she's ready and I was like literally like the face was hot and I just came out and just gave up. I was like, I'm sorry. We got to come up with a different paradigm to make this happen. Like, you know, and eventually you figure it out and work. But that first time is fucking brutal to

Speaker 1:          20:20          talk about. What do you think about these fighters that hold off for. That's ridiculous. They're crazy. They're distracting the shit out of them. So yeah, that seems like a really bad at. It's so silly. I don't think there's no. No writing, no, no tests, no studies done ever that show a decrease in performance due to the fact that you're having sex. I think the distraction that you would get from not having sex would be way more problematic. That would fuck you up more. Will up your train of thought. You wouldn't want to fight you on it. Get some pussy fucking late when he got laid in eight weeks when going through training camp. That's crazy. I mean it seemed. They seemed to say that it builds aggression that they just want to conquer. I'm sure it does, but just aggression. Do you need a fucking professional cage fighter already?

Speaker 1:          21:09          Chances are you're aggressive. You know, you really need to be more fucked up under a better ground game though, because they always want to get on the ground who used to fight and he used to fuck right before he fought Tyson. That should be the end of discussion. Yeah, I didn't. I didn't understand from sexual intercourse. It just is a natural feeling for me. I just had to make sure I was relaxed before my big fights. Those all tyson training videos are beautiful. The passwords, his early fights man, like Marvis frazier, you're wanting. Tamara was frazier fight. That was a salt. He just ran up to that regular dude and beat the fuck out of him. What? His Super Alpha body. That shit didn't even make any sense. He came out of nowhere and got everybody excited about fighting again for the longest time after Mohammed Ali. Nobody gave a fuck about boxing.

Speaker 1:          21:56          It's like the Larry Holmes era. Everybody's like, wow, that's Larry Holmes was fighting pink Thomas. I don't even know if they ever fought, but you know my point, it was like, who gives a shit? Oh, Tony tubs. Who gives a shit? Michael Dokes, whatever. You know that all of a sudden this crazy motherfucker moving 100 times faster than everybody else and just smashing people in the face at will. That's what we wanted to see. We didn't want to see that. Those fights were fights. You want to see us salts two minutes. You're. It was worth it. Not really though. People get pissed off. You have a bunch of friends over for review because nobody gives a fuck about the prelims and boxing. That's one of the beautiful things about the UFC. Got a UFC card. You're not just getting the main event, you're getting a fuck load of other flights and they're all well matched and they're all people you give a shit about are all.

Speaker 1:          22:42          They're all exciting fights, especially the ones that actually make the air. So there's a bunch of shit to watch. So if the end fight is only like 15 seconds, you know, like Anderson Silva and you know James Irvin or something like Bam, it's over. You don't feel ripped off. I feel like, oh, we saw a lot of shit before we saw those Tyson fights. Man. I'd have friends saying I ain't even bought. The last one was 34 could circuits. It's like, yeah man. But that's kind of an epic moment. The one I missed was the one where you lost a. I saw because I was like, who fucking beat the shit out of this guy? Buster Douglas was like 60 to one underdog or something crazy. Crazy. What was the other? He was something Nutty, right? It wasn't like 31 or something. You got the. And then I remember I watched it, I watched the tape and I was convinced whilst watching the tape that he was going to win.

Speaker 1:          23:29          I'm like, Tyson's going to win this. I was like, I know he's gonna win. I know he got knocked out, but I was watching a fucking replay of it and I was like, she's going to win this. I know he's got a big fucking joke, man. You can't be losing ice. It doesn't lose. It's important that when you're a kid to realize that there are human beings, that everyone's just a human being because there's a few people that just pass that human being marked in your brain, you know, like Mike Tyson or meeting somebody, meeting some famous dude. I met ace freely when I was a little kid and all of a sudden he was just as dude, you know, ace Frehley was the lead guitarist of kiss for people don't know. And uh, my uncle used to work in an advertising agency and uh, we're in his office, I'm hanging out with my uncle and all of a sudden this dude walks in and it's ace freely.

Speaker 1:          24:14          And I was a huge kiss fan and they didn't even have makeup on. This is back when kiss wore makeup. Look, you didn't know who they are freely. I was like, what the fuck? I couldn't believe that dude was right there. And as you get older you go, oh, that's just another dude. Yeah, like Kenny loggins. Once I brought people like Kenny loggins that people think that way about. I met Kenny loggins. Pretty cool. Did you dance? He's the one who plays the flute, right? Was He? Oh, not Kenny loggins. Kenny g, Kenny G. I didn't meet footloose. I met the flute. Dude. Does he play the flute? What does Kenny log? Employee clarinet or something? Gary. Is he the only dude to ever get that famous from playing that instrument? Right. He must be a bad motherfucker. Kenny g is like the Lance Armstrong of the flute or whatever the fuck you.

Speaker 1:          25:03          Pied Piper was pretty popular. What does Kenny g play? Saxophone. Does he put aside a little bit of sac motors that John just have a super white guy? Saxophone or horrible. Super White. Super White Guy. Clarinet. Yeah. The dance. Again, it was Kenny g was giant for awhile. Man and giant with anger. People get angry at Kenny g music. You know like dudes like comics are always use. Kenny g was an awesome punchline. If you want to shit on somebody. No. Why is it that it was the amount? I think it's the emasculation that he represented. He represents dudes married to women. They don't want to be married to out on dates, having to go to a Kenny g concert and just sitting there and shit in a world of shit when you can be with your friends at the bar, drinking and throwing darts, talk and shit. Watching sports and having fun.

Speaker 1:          26:00          No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You had a Kenny g concert, stupid. And you have a jacket on because she likes the way you look with jackets. I like a sport jacket and he got your fucking sport. That's what raised the ire and you're eating shit. That's it. That's the end of the show. That was the romantic ending it with Kenny G. before we go July, I brought a gift for a. Oh, what do you got Brian here? What do you got? So, you know, people, people kind of overlook a lot of very legal and very cool substances that are available. And uh, so I brought you guys some Blue Lotus oil. Now, as you know, Lotus, Lotus oil was historically prize from the land of the Lotus eaters, kind of gives you this euphoric feeling and it's existed. A lot of Hindu art work, the lotus flower.

Speaker 1:          26:44          So it's um, it's actually, you know, quite they taste like a ton of lotus oil to make this one little vial here. This might be, it might be loud as I can do it. So. Well, what is it? So it's a little vial here. Let me open this up here. That did extract like out of thousands and thousands and thousands of loads. It's an actual ton of pedals to make the pedals 2000 pounds to make that little vial and you make a little of that and then. So then they make this vow is to. Oh, he dropped it. So it'd be an issue. So a large is 2000 pedals. It must be 2000 pounds.

Speaker 3:          27:26          Yeah, I mean I mean 2000 pound believable. So it makes it makes sense, like an ounce of the oil and what does it look like in a room like this fucking time. So it was very pricey. So I took that, I actually review it on my blog where you pull it down to us and you can check it out. And I took it. Yeah. Have you had a third one? But you've had about. I had about a half of a mile. It kind of comes out tufts. So I gave it a stiff shake because that what you, you. This was full and there was no, no, this is brand new. This is brand new. It's brand new. So this is how it comes. It comes out for took maybe maybe about half of that, maybe took about half of that and it was pretty Rad. You feel you feel very euphoric and you know, you, you're everything, all your sensations feel good and it's not overpowering.

Speaker 3:          28:12          It's not something that like takes you and hit you with a hammer. But when you say I love you, your girlfriend, you really mean it, you know, like listen, I really need all the time. Not like you really mean it, but it's like you really feel it. You know what I'm saying? Like you feel the emotion, really feel it all the time. Dude. But it's like you man, I'm a problem for women. Some crazy dreams I dreamed. I was like, ah, never dreams this dream as a vampire playing basketball, doing shots back steam out from underneath the basket and just reject some dude and Shaq dunk on vampire. Super relaxing, very relaxing you for like very kind of Cathartic. Like you could still function. Totally. Totally. It was very lucid and stuff. Do you feel intoxicated at all or not really? You just feel it like in a bad ass mood and it's almost like the stuff that troubles you, they go away. What about you? Are you, are you comfortable that your reaction time? Would it be this? I Siam Yeah. I mean you'd be able to drive and it doesn't have that kind of artificial feeling that some of the other opiates and sedatives and stuff kind of allergic that lotus though. And you're like, oh shit. I know shit. I didn't even find out if you're allergic to Lloyd gay tests, do you like Kenny g dot? You can't take this shit.
