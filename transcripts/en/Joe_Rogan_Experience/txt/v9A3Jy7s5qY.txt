Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Bom Bom four, three, two, one. Ben Greenfield eats ants. Just want everybody to know, hey, if I was going to go to Disney as much as you go to Disney, I'd eat a lot more black ants. Why are you eating it? Supposedly I actually don't know that much about dance. I'm just, I'm just eating it because it supposedly gives you energy. I need to pick me up this morning. We lifted the waste this morning and I needed a second boost of energy. But apparently these ants live in Ginseng roots and they have something that grows in their heads that acts as like a nootropic. It's like some kind of a chemical nootropic and it also supposedly is one of these Chinese energy tonics. It's like the whole, you know, the doctrine of signatures, you know, the doctrine of signatures. Now it's the idea that that things in nature give you clues, right?

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       So, so like when you slice open a tomato, you've got the four chambers of the heart and tomato, supposedly good for the hearts or pomegranate is good for your blood. And the little pomegranate seeds look like red blood cells. You slice open a carrot that looks like an eye or you, you crack open an egg, it looks like an eye. Those are, those are good for your vision. Um, sweet potatoes, which everybody thinks is like at like a sweet, sugary food, those are actually shaped like a pancreas and they can actually help to normalize your, your Beta cells, like your, your insulin producing Beta cells in your pancreas. So you're looking at walnuts for your brain and people talk about a Aba Cahtos, right? Supposedly they look a little bit like an ovary and they're good for female reproductive function. So you can, you can carry that over from the plant kingdom into the animal kingdom and say that if you eat ants because they're such energetic endurance driven creatures that it supposedly will make you stronger.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       Boys, that's a stretch. Oh wait til this stuff hits me in the arm. Wrestle. Find that. Have you been doing it for awhile? How long have you been taking this stuff? That was the third time I've, I've actually used it. You just send dissolve. I mean, I use it for workout a couple of times. So this is your concoction, right? You took ground but ants. I didn't grind up the answer myself. That would have been exhausting to catch you by the up. I bought ground up black ant powder and just pulled up some Ginseng. Yes, I don't think they're called. That's actually, that's where I bought them. So that's where I bought them. Last part, Paulie. Righteous ants. A Qi tonic of Chinese herbalism. But you know what? The Chinese people are also into the Rhino Horn. It's not just a pre workout or according to the website.

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       It's a pre workout. Super Herbs, a super supposedly far more scientifically super regular food. Right. It's like a super food. Exactly. I'm a little annoyed with that word. Super. I, I like that idea though, of the doctrine of signatures. Rarer like certain things that I see in nature being good for you. There's, there's one called, um, I forget the, uh, the name of this plant, but it's called the insulin of the heart and it's amazing for decreasing sympathetic nervous system activation and causing you to relax and it has these beneficial cardiovascular properties and people who are just so driven that they tend to have, for example, you know, a heart attack or an emi and it's uh, it's not split. Lance thies, I forget the name of this but it, but it looks like a heart and it has all these red vessels that kind of come off it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       It's called the insulin of the heart. Um, there's, there's an APP that my kids and I used to identify a lot of these. It's called flower checker. So you read about this and stuff online and then you started taking it and then you mix it in some sort of a tincture here. Just vodka. Yeah. Yeah. Urbane that stuff nature. But forgotten remedy for heart disease bay. And I interviewed a physician on my show, Dr Thomas Cowan, and he wrote a book about how the heart is not a pump and he talks about the true reason for heart disease, being sympathetic nervous system overdrive, what? What does he mean by the hardest, not a pump mineral depletion and dehydration and what he means by the heart is not a pump. It's a fascinating book. The shape of the chest is a, I believe it's called like a tetrahedron or some something like that, but basically as fluid moves through the heart, the action of the fluid actually moving through the heart allows it to pass through the heart and not have to be pumped through the body, but rather the shape of the heart is almost like causing the fluid to move in a vortex.

Speaker 1:          00:04:25       And so most certainly out of the oh the heart, the heart contracts, but, but it's less of a pumping action and more of like a, like a vortex flow that it creates. A book's called why your heart is not a pump. It's very interesting. Is it why well received amongst scientists. It kind of flies under the radar a little bit. Yeah. Yeah, but it's. It's an interesting book. Short book. It's like maybe pages loan universally regarded as a pump. Yeah. I don't know if, if you would necessarily classify it as a pump as much as a contracting muscle that boom, boom, boom, but when you die and then they bring you back to life, they push your heart to make it pump. Pump, pump, pump, pump, pump seems good. Yeah. So I don't know. Shit and read the book. It's interesting. It's interesting, but this, this, uh, this flower checker app is flower checker APP.

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       It's really cool. You, you take a picture of a plant and then there's a team of live botanists on the other end and within 24 hours they identify the plant for you and you can learn it's edible properties. It's medicinal property. So my kids and I can walk around and take pictures of different plants, different flowers, different things on our land, and it develops this online or Barium that then allows you to keep track of all the different plants and what you've learned about them and what they're good for. So we use that whenever we're identifying plants. There was one time when we were fishing off the, off the, uh, the north fork of the clearwater. So we went on this fly trip and we're starting

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       this water, the clearwater up in Idaho. So we were near a Grangeville. Most people fly into Grangeville, Idaho. It's a great fly fishing, huge steelhead. And uh, the, the hike that we went on, we didn't have our phones or anything with us to take pictures of, of what we were finding. And we found this, this enormous, uh, almost like a, like a field of wild asparagus, which, and my buddy who was with us, he had bear broth that he was, that he was, it was like a bare bone broth that he had in this vat back at the cabin. So we harvested all this asparagus and this was before it went out fishing and I put all the asparagus into the bone broth and then just left for the day. And then we came back and we had, we had fish, we had bone broth, we had asparagus and we all ate this bone broth and it turns out that this stuff was not asparagus.

Speaker 2:          00:06:45       So my kids in our heads were spinning all night. The guy that owned the cabin, apparently he didn't sleep, he was just like hunched over the toilet the whole evening and it turns out this stuff is cold. I think it was Brassica, it looks like Asparagus, but apparently it has very high levels of nicotine. So we were all career dosed on nicotine for the next two days on this fishing trip to be really careful. That's the only time I haven't used that APP to actually go, go plant food chain. Who thought it was asparagus? We all thought it was asparagus, you know, it was me, one of the chefs who is out of the cabin with us, uh, my kids and, and twin nine year old boys know a lot about plants, so we always trumps the wild asparagus. But I was convinced it was asparagus.

Speaker 2:          00:07:30       I mean I, I kind of tasted it out there where we were. We were out in the field and it tasted like asparagus, but no, it's not asparagus. It's Brassica Jesus Christ. That sounds horrible. Yeah. But there's another app called plantsnap and apparently uses artificial intelligence, you know, like a reverse google image search to identify a plant. I've used that and it's, it's useless. Anything you take a picture of it, it doesn't seem to be able to identify anything but this flower Checker, it's just live people on the other end does google, there's a google image search is like some, some, there's an application that use cameras and if you take a photo of something can identify exactly. I think that's called like a reverse google image search or something like that. But, but the ai doesn't seem to work as well for plant identification and I would imagine it's looking at the leaves, the shape of the leaves, how it comes up, plan, you know, the veins, the opposite versus symmetrical and everything that goes into a plant identification.

Speaker 2:          00:08:26       But now when you, you still rather go with a real person. Still had. Yeah. You got to go with a real person. You got to go with an actual botanist. Steelhead are a ocean bound, a rainbow trout, right. They come forth. Yeah. Um, do you guys do catch and release or do you eat them? This was all catch and release though. There is a common thing with those. There's a certain kind that you can catch. And I, I'm not a fly fishing expert. This is like a fun trip with my kids to learn how to fly fish and we didn't catch any of that. We could actually keep. Yeah. I don't understand that kind

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       of fishing. It's weird, you know that take a long trip, go out into the wilderness, go to the river, catch fish, let it go. Yeah. Seems it's, it's the thrill of the chase. I get it. It feels great for kids. Yeah. I've done it with kids, bass fishing before, but it's just a can't do that. When you bow hunt? Nope. Nope, no catch and release. Weird thing. You're sticking a hook and a fish's mouth and then letting it go. Yeah, got them. Let's let them go. They're hard to reel and less like a 10 minute fight. Efficient and they're big. Yeah. There's powerful fish to the ocean currents. Ocean fish are almost always more strong when you pull them in a freshwater fish, other. They're very strong. They're stronger than ants, I would imagine. Yeah. Spiel back to the animals. Go back to this amp thing and, and tell me what has been the reaction, like when you take it, how you feel.

Speaker 1:          00:09:47       It's more just like a cup of coffee. You really did feel like you do. You do feel more energy. Do you think it's because of the Ginseng or is it possible to see both fact and they just live within the gen sing and that makes the story sexier for the website that sells. So you think just eating the ants themselves, give you an entry. I would imagine that you'd have to catch a lot of ants to get what you'd get out of like all the powdered extract that they sell you. Right. But I mean eating the powdered extract then just that somehow or another. What's the mechanism for giving you energy? Uh, there's some chemical that's in the ants hot. I don't know the mechanism of action again, I like, hi, I really don't claim to be an expert in index extract, but yet you got a bottle of tribe.

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       I have a bottle of. It was, it was in with all my other supplements and uh, and uh, I was packing up this morning and thought it would be an interesting one. It is interesting to show to you just a giant bottle that says aunt on it. What is the, what's the standard way that people take it to the cloud or as a tincture? Yeah, I would imagine you could probably put it in a smoothie, you know, with your, with your bee pollen and other insect derivatives. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, what a weird one, Huh? Yeah. Anyways. Oh, you should've come out and done the spartan. I knew you were Disney. Yeah, I told you I couldn't go. So I said I should cook Spartan. Spartan's a sport. Ends a little bit more interested in business in my opinion. I didn't go to Disney for myself.

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       Yeah, yeah they have. They have kids you'd like to, but you were doing commentary or something? Is that what you're doing? I was doing the uh, they, they have commentary all day long with these spartan race. So I was doing the commentary and then I raced the next day. Oh, so you did it one day competition one day. So it was a two day race thing. It would, they do the way they do it, they get like tens probably I would say some of these races, eight to 12,000 athletes that in that approximate range. So they break it up, they go out, they break it up, there's long races, they're short races. So the long race was 13, about 13 miles, which on the road half marathon, that'd be like a 105 that an athlete would do on a, on a race like that. And so with the obstacles and the hills and it's not a big bear, which is a ski, which I just found out from my wife apparently used fake snow.

Speaker 1:          00:11:56       There's like a pond at the top of the, at the top of the resort that they make all the snow with apparently snow, but it's artificially created. Right. It's like you make with the snow machines artificially created real snow made from water at the top of the mountain in the snow machine. It's not. Yeah, it's, it's not. It's not foam. I wonder if anybody's trying to do that to make foam snow. Yeah. And it makes some snow. Asked him at the mall in Dubai. They've got some, they've got something over there. I don't know if that's a snow machine. Right. It probably is actual Snow Dragon Mall in Dubai. They have like a crazy hill. Right. And it gets, you know, they have an actual indoor skew. They've penguins and indoor ski resort, everything. Yeah. So this race though, for those same 13 miles, it's like two hours and I think the winter did a to 16 to 17, something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       So it's. So you have to jump over a lot slower. You gotta carry, carry sandbags and carry big gravel buckets. It's like doing yard chores and then running to the next chore, Barbwire Crawling and Hoisting ropes. But it's good for full body fitness because I used to do triathlon when I did triathlon it was weak, right? Because you swim, you bike, you run. And I had an engine that could go for days, but I did my first spartan race. I couldn't climb a rope and I couldn't carry sandbag up a hill. So I think it's good for functional fitness. Here it is right here at. Tammy's. Got a video out there that's a, that's a stadium. That's actually a good way to start inside of the stadium. Dodger's stadium a couple of years and. And you know, you don't have to get muddy and there's no fake snow and the stadium races can selfies.

Speaker 1:          00:13:26       I don't know how it can be kind of a joke because some people will go out and uniforms with big cowboy hats on and you know, dressed up as spiderman in their Lycra and then some people they have these elite waves where it's actual, you know, legit athletes doing this kind of interesting though. But it is, you know, you can see you move your body in a lot of different ways on these courses. So it's fun. You know, it's fun to train for it because you got to train all your different body parts and you train for power and strength and there's endurance. So it's a good mix of everything. I didn't know they're doing them in stadiums. That's kind of cool. The stadium races are cool because you show up at a t and t stadium, we're running a race and you go up and down and they will turn a stadium into like a three to four mile event.

Speaker 1:          00:14:13       I mean, that's how many times you go up and down the stairs and they have an event for the kids where the kids will go up and down the stairs and the kids have miniature sandbags and miniature spears. So it actually is kind of a cool then that's pretty bad ass that looked family except for his fucking selfie stick. Like everything must be documented. You cannot live in this life without people knowing exactly what you're doing at all times. Running a selfie stick. I'm taking my kids to one of those, uh, those trained hunt competitions this weekend. Oh yeah, in bonners ferry. So they're going to do their first actual kids and same thing, it's the kids' events where the kid shoot, they've got 15 to 20 yard shots and then they have like a sandbag lift and a run and then they've got another shot and then they've got burpees up and over cooler and another shot.

Speaker 1:          00:14:55       And there's a, there's a grownup event and a kid's event. Those things are fun too. And that's, those are really interesting. The idea behind them is kind of cool too because it lets people know what like if you're, if you're involved in one of those back country backpack hunts, it's, it's very much a physical event, like pretty much you're carrying most likely at least 35 to 45 pounds on your back, especially if you're carrying your camp on your back and then you're hiking, you know, thousands of feet of elevation. You're up and down, climbing over logs and shit. You're carrying your bow. There's a lot of physical exertion involve like there will. There's a lot of crawling, a lot of crawling. Yeah. Yeah. I mean you did that. Hawaii hunt hunt, Lanai Lanaya. I hunted Kona, uh, I guess it was like five weeks ago. And on the sheep hunt because the sheep stale and the in the open plains you'll crawl sometimes for an hour and a half to two to get close enough for a shot.

Speaker 1:          00:15:49       Yeah. The final day when I killed, I killed two axis buck out there and the final day we crawled for at least an hour, at least an hour, like super fucking slow. Those things are switched on. It's frustrating to with with an enema or sheep. Sheep are not stupid. They're smart. No, they're not as fast as an access, but that's the most frustrating part is, is you'll put on a crawl, right? Maybe you're 200 yards out and you spend an hour getting 60 and then the wind swirls. Yeah. They pick you up and they're off and that has to stand up and brush yourself off and you got to go crawl again. Yeah. But you know, if it was easy wouldn't hunting. Yeah, just be killing. I got one of those jungle scrub cows. I told you how you were telling me about that. So these to explain to people what a scrub bull is because apparently they're just.

Speaker 1:          00:16:34       There's feral cows and bulls and cows. I shot a cow and I thought at first that it was going to be kind of a stupid hunch and the cow because it, you know, the, the pigs are pigs that they eat really well because they feed on macadamia nuts. They're a lot better than the pigs in Texas and they taste amazing. Now you're Damien. We did it, we did it, yeah. Was very fatty and it's like, like a nutty meat. So we did a Cinco de Mayo cookoff, me and my kids and we took the ribs from, from this pig. Then I shipped back so you know, it costs 150 bucks to ship 250 pounds of meat back from Kona. So had sheep, pig and cow and shipped it all back, which is not that expensive. And the pig was, I mean, it, it ain't better than any pork I've ever had in my life.

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       These ribs. And we blended them up and my kids made it, made an adobo sauce with the peppers and they have a little food podcast. So we, we did all this for their food podcast. But oh my goodness. It's like the fattiest but, but like a nutty, flavorful fat [inaudible] because they feed on these macadamia nuts, you know, there's no grain, there's no corn and they're just wild and running around out there. So the pig was really good, but the cow was tough. It was, it was a, it was a tough cow. I went on the first day we were out there, I took the back strap and I soak that in lemon juice all day and in that kind of broke it down a little bit and it wasn't that bad. But what I do when I got home was I've got a refrigerator in my garage and I hooked up a temperature controller to it and get this temperature controller.

Speaker 1:          00:18:01       It's called a four one nine, you know, keep the temperature of the refrigerator about 34 to 38 degrees. So rather than plugging the refrigerator, the wall, you plugged into this, this temp control unit and then you put a humidifier in and a fan like on the, on the bottom of the fridge and then you take all your meat and you lay it out on grates in the refrigerator. And I left it in there for about three weeks to scrub cow and it develops this hard gristly coating on the outside of, of the, of the meat. And then I took it out and just sliced all of this hard gristly part off of the outside. And the inside of that meat was like butter to dry aging and essentially that's it. That's exactly what it is. It's a dry age and refrigerator, but you control the, the temperature, you want about 34 to 38 degrees and then the humidity can vary a lot more than that.

Speaker 1:          00:18:47       But I kept the humidity at about 60 to 70 degrees. And then basically you just slice off all that hard gristly external coding and you've got this amazing super soft super tender. And then I just have this, uh, this vacuum packer and it's a cool little unit. You can just cut a bag any size you want, right? For a neck or a shoulder, like a smaller bag for a backstrap or a tenderloin and a bagged it up. Yeah. I have one of those vacuum sealer. So those things are awesome. Yeah. So the dry aging was key. Yeah. I have friends that have one of those walk in coolers and they could set it to a certain temperature and they hang the meat and dry aged out there. But I don't know what walk in cooler they have because I looked into the dry aging refrigerators and those are like $5,000.

Speaker 1:          00:19:30       But you can get a refrigerator off Craig's list that a four. One thing I bought that was like 50 bucks I'll think is it on the refrigerator? Just a normal size refrigerator. And so and so the food is on grates inside the refrigerator. So it took all the shelving out of the refrigerator and I just put some plywood on, on either side of the refrigerator and I put these metal. Great. So, so you constructed your own sort of exact and then just laid the meat down on the grates and put the fan on the bottom of the refrigerator. So it's constantly circulating air inside the refrigerator. And then the temperature controller has this, uh, uh, it'll display. So in my kitchen, in my house, it'll display the temperature and the humidity. So I know if something goes wrong. So not all that meat spoils inside the refrigerator.

Speaker 1:          00:20:14       Cause I'll see when I'm inside my kitchen it'll read that, that the temperature is getting too high. And the refrigerator, maybe somebody unplug the fridge or the controller, you know, needed to be reset, which happened a couple of times, but if you want to keep an eye on it, yeah, that's a great way though to take meat and make it far more flavorful. More tender. Well, especially that kind of meat. I mean, that's tough anyways. It's tough. Gamey. Yeah. These, um, water buffaloes, like you see the one behind me, a buddy of mine shot one of those in Australia and he said that he had a campaigns. He had a piece of it in his mouth and who's chewing one piece for a half an hour. That's how tough it is. And this was the backstrap, which was one of the more tender parts of the body. There's this idea of animals that's good for.

Speaker 1:          00:20:57       It's good for your jaw. It's good for your teeth structure. Like there was this guy, I think it's maximum mew. My brother sent me this, this youtube video of this guy, but his, his whole idea is that that humans, jaw structure, our bone density or teeth or trigeminal nerves, all of that don't work as well as they should because we grow up on soft food. We don't have to chew food. It makes sense. A lot of boxers to like big chunks of Bazooka, bubblegum. It gets kind of hard after awhile. Exactly. Dig into it and develops muscular endurance or your jaw Mazda. Um, uh, I've seen machines rather where you take like a leather strap in your mouth and you're hanging a piece of weight from it and you're, you're doing this. I, yeah. People were selling those for awhile as a way to decrease rating of perceived exertion during exercise, exercise mouthpieces and that.

Speaker 1:          00:21:47       The advertising on them was that the vikings used to chew on leather before they go into battle to reduce pain and increase their time to exhaustion. And so they actually sell these mouthpieces that you bite down on when you're exercising, but they were designed to strengthen the jaw as much as to reduce how hard you felt like you were working during exercise. And some people swear by these exercises, mouthpieces. Well, I know that the mouthpieces supposedly can maximize the amount of effort that you can put forth. Like there's a difference in the amount of strength you tightened down. It's almost like when you shake somebody's hand and make a fist with one hand than you shake their hand, you're, you're stronger. You know? And that's, that's something that puzzles that. Celine talks about his books. You know, about how to generate as much force as possible for as low as one fist.

Speaker 1:          00:22:32       You know, even if you're going to do like a bottoms up kettle bell press, right, you can do it with one hand open and press and you close your hand and contract this fist and it's, it's far easier. So what is the idea behind that? At some highlights energizes your entire body. It's Fascia, you know, the, the, your, your, your Fascia covers, your entire body should be tightened up, one part of it. It causes you to be able to produce more for. So let me try some time with a Kettlebell or water bottle or a coffee cup. I flex my hand outward when I'm doing like bottoms up kettle bell. You Flex your hand? Yeah, I definitely flex my hand. I'd never just like let it sit. You know, there's always, there's always some tension. It's, it's, it's, it's full body tension, you know, so it's the same reason that you'll see a lot of tennis players or I think boxers do this to a Valsalva maneuver when you strike.

Speaker 1:          00:23:19       So you hold your breath and go right. Understand that same thing. It tightens up everything and allows you to produce more force. Um, the uh, the other gum, you mentioned the bazooka, there's a gum called mastic gum and I interviewed this guy, Dean Karnazes, who run the. He did the 50 marathons in 50 days and he, he ran the, the traditional marathon in Greece, which is apparently not 26 point two miles. It's like 100 and some miles that he ran and he would chew this mastic gum, which they do use for jaw strengthen, but it makes you produce more saliva to so. So when you're running, you know, you can get dry mouth when you're running and in a lot of times you get, you know, be thinking about food you want to eat. This mastic gum apparently keeps your appetite satiated and allows you to produce saliva.

Speaker 1:          00:24:00       And I bought some and it's to that shit. It's A. I think I got it on mastic gum. Amazon of mastic gum. Yeah, that's what it looks like. Little rocks in. The interesting thing is, is you can take it out after you're done chewing it and then just like the next day, put it back in your mouth and keep going. You can chew that stuff for days. It's like a, like an everlasting gobstopper tastes like it tastes like ass. It's not that it's not that good, but if you have this, uh, there's this h pylori issue. It's supposedly very good for that. Yeah. Look that one they added, they added licorice, annecy and the fennel. So it tastes even shittier. Yeah, but, but it's supposedly, you know, this idea that we, we grow up on soft food and babies eat, eat soft food. Yeah. You wouldn't want the capsule that would.

Speaker 1:          00:24:45       I mean the capsule would be good for your. That's where you got to be careful. There's a lot of companies sell it as a capsule. Right. Is mastic gum as a capsule but gum that you chew on, that's the exact one I have that kronos said there's nasty trumped. Yeah. Yeah. And that's, that's the stuff that you actually choose to make your jaw stronger and to produce extra saliva. Huh. And do you use this stuff when you work out or you just occasionally chewing? No, I don't like to have gum in my mouth. So many different things going on in so many different modalities of you're experimenting with. There's no way you can do is I try stuff and I write about it. It's not like, it's not like I'm doing mastic, gum and black powder and injections all day long and it works. I would think you would keep doing it all the time, but it's just like you forget about a lot of stuff though.

Speaker 1:          00:25:35       You try out so many things. You forget about it. Like, Oh yeah, I tried that out a while ago. It was pretty good. I need to order some more of that. So yeah, you start to lose track of all the. All the stuff I try, I don't have it all systematized. Some big excel spreadsheet. What are you doing with the exomes? Explain that because I just got some shot into some tears that I have on my shoulders. You got it. It's, it's exosomes. Exosomes. They're signaling molecules so your body actually has them. Your, your cells have exosomes and they're used as cell to cell communicators. So they interact with cell surface receptors and they'll actually carry a message from one cell to another such as, you know, uh, you know, you need to, you need to absorb this into the cell. You need to carry this to a joint or whatever you'd want to use an exome for to carry messages throughout the body.

Speaker 1:          00:26:21       It's part of your belief. It's referred to as the Para System, right? You're your body's internal cellular communication system. So the idea is that if you combined the exosomes with other therapies, let like a platelet rich plasma injections, which you'd do for it to increase the amount of growth fast. What they did to a specific joint. Did exosomes plus prp you, which I, I, I can, I can tell you the full procedure that I did, but I just got that all over my face. My face five days ago was red and swollen because it was covered with exosomes prp injections. So it's a beauty procedure. Beautiful as you are. Thank you. Thank you. You don't need change. But now I'm a beautiful 13 year old and a 37 year old. So the uh, the exosomes can be combined with other things like prp and also with stem cells or with bone marrow.

Speaker 1:          00:27:13       And that's what I did. And the interesting thing is that you can get something like a placental cell. Right? And in my case, they actually took placental cells from this lab called Kymera labs. I had this procedure done in Park City, Utah. Going to him, Dr Harry Adelson and he, he had these placental cells from our labs. They destroy the placental cell so that there's no actual DNA from some other person that you're putting into your body. Right, which is, which is the. That's considered to be part of the risk of stem cells. Even umbilical or amniotic, you're still getting somebody else's DNA into your body, not your own DNA. So the idea is that you would take exosomes that you've isolated from something like a placental tissue and then you would mix those with your own stem cells. In this case, what I used was a bone marrow aspirate they went into to both of my iliac crest.

Speaker 1:          00:28:10       They took out the bone marrow. They mix it with the exosomes and and these, these videos. I published both of the videos on youtube and it's like a. it's like a huge syringe full drawing it out. I'm going to see the drawing on my hip. How much bone marrow. They're taken out of your head a lot. I was while I was out, you know, I was heavily sedated during the entire procedure. Will not heavily. I was under general anesthesia, it's called full body sedation to general anesthesia with few of the risks, the actual anesthesia. I was not conscious. Not though. I mean, all I remember is they said count from 100 down to zero and I got to like 93 and then I woke up. Yeah, exactly. So they took the bone marrow from the ILIAC crest. Right. Which is just like bone broth for your whole body's got collagen.

Speaker 1:          00:28:57       Peptides got stem cells, they mix it with the exosomes which act as communicators from those placental cells. This place called [inaudible] labs, which my opinion is just a great sexy name for some kind of a mysterious lab company where you buy placentas. So basically they, uh, they mixed the exosomes with the bone marrow and then what they do. Oh yeah. See that's what, let's let your ass that. Yeah, that's one of the early at crest. You asked me how much they took, how much they're pulling out of you. Holy Shit. Bone marrow. He did that like four times because he did it twice to. Are you fucking shitting me? This was five days ago. He told me I was supposed to not do anything for two weeks, but I did the Spartan race. I armored myself up. Why didn't you listen to them? Well, I, uh, I was signed up for the race and I had sponsor obligations to actually not do sponsors to suck my Dick [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:29:51       That looks like a fat Dick there. I use like four rolls of rocktape. My entire body was just taped up because I didn't want to ruin anything that he'd done. So anyways. How could he. He did. What do you mean by rocktape? What is rock tape? Kinesio tape. You've seen this stuff before. It's like what you see crossfitters were tendinitis supports. It supports the joints. Oh Jesus. They're going in for another tube. Four of those, four of those big tubes, Jamie, to think you have in your body. You think you have four tubes of marrow floating around so I could pull out here. Oh yeah. Well, the tubes also, you know this, when you give blood you can give like 19 tubes of blood, but it's not as much blood as it actually looks like because it's inside of that little skinny tube. Right? No, I get that.

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       So he and his partner, it was like quite a lot. What they did was he went with that bone marrow to mixed with the exosomes. They mix it with ozone, which apparently using an [inaudible] which apparently increases the efficacy of the bone marrow. And you're doing this for no specific injury, no specific injury? No. This is all just for for two reasons. Number One, anti aging. Number two, just immersive journalism just to write about. I think this stuff's fun to write about and look into and study. So and, and apparently the stem cell state of Elvis, so this, this is an over exaggeration, but it's almost like you'd be like wolverine or like you recover faster when you get hurt for the rest of your life. So here he goes out round two for people who are listening to the audio, not watching the video. It's like a horse pulling a horse second, so it's a lot of blood.

Speaker 1:          00:31:24       And uh, then he injected my entire musculoskeletal system. He did my cerebral spinal fluid. He did all up and down the discs in my back. Oh Daddy, you conscious here? I've got needles. No, dude, I'm totally out. I would not want to be conscious. I was just box breathing. Yeah, I was meditating. I'm totally out for this. [inaudible] done. You can see there. I have, I have the ironman corporate logo on my back, so I didn't. Yeah, I'm technically that's trademark infringement. The iron man logo I had, I'm retaking done in my spine like that. Bulging discs is awake. It's just so weird. They just just done a lot of this stuff before. I mean, I had my, I told you this last time. I had my stem cells taken out of the fat and my back down in Florida and then, uh, I re injected them intravenously and then I tested my telomere length.

Speaker 1:          00:32:15       Look at this, look at this. They just, Oh, this goes on for our students. And like I was there for three or four hours, so they just screw it in and pop those in and find a new hole. You're totally alcohol. But I'm totally a cold. My wife's in there freaking out. She can see her somewhere in there holding the camera. Hey, she was, she was doing a facebook live and answering questions as we went. So get this. His partner comes in, she takes those exosomes after he does ankles, knees, hips, elbows, wrists, back. Every part of my mother, they flipped me over by ice cold. Yeah. My wife said that was the weirdest part was they flipped me over and I'm losing limp. Like a noodle. I think she's moving my hand. See that. So, uh, then his partner came in and she's like a sexual performance and beauty specialist and I don't want this to turn into another podcast about just injecting things into your deck.

Speaker 1:          00:33:06       But she did a hip, but she did, uh, she, she injected the Corpus Cavernosum, which is the shaft of your unit. And then she did the head of the penis and then she did my face over and over and over again, everywhere. Exosomes all over my face. And I've seen some 50 and 60 year old women who have done this and it actually does seem to have a pretty significant effect. I don't, I don't know how much of an effect it had on me, but I said if they were going to put me under just, he called it a full body stem cell make over. Apparently nobody's ever in the history of the world, done this before. So if I, if I die, that's the one thing I can brag about you. This is what I don't understand. You don't need this shit. No. A lot of the, like I said, a lot of a lot of this stuff is uh, it's, it's interesting to write stories about and to talk about and tell people what it's like.

Speaker 1:          00:34:03       And then they did a, yeah, they did that on the face. What, where they do on your face here. And uh, that's the exosomes and mixed with PRP. What does that inject into the face? Doing it with, what is that thing? I don't remember because I wasn't awake, but it looks like it's got little needles all over. I think it might be like some kind of like dermabrasion type of thing. I'm not sure. Can your face up, man, I mean this was a few days ago and how many feel like a heel five days ago? Yeah. So I healed up pretty quickly from CSI because five was when I was doing my head to where I'm a great minds think alike. Dude. That is crazy. That's actually what day is it too bad? No, it's Tuesday. So this was actually this. No, seven, seven days ago. Seven days ago. Mine was Wednesday.

Speaker 1:          00:34:51       Um. Anyways though. Their fucking face. Absolutely. Yeah. And I had, I actually had just gotten a concussion because I got in a bike accident when I was down in Austin, Texas a couple of weeks ago. And so the other thing that, this is interesting because for a Tbi there's all sorts of things that you can do right? Like ketones, exogenous ketones work really well for that and that's a lot of dominic d'agostino is research on concussions. A Dha is another good one. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy chambers with the high oxygen plus the high pressure that's really efficacious for concussions. But the other thing is stem cells. And so what I did was I ordered the stem cells that they harvested from my body and Florida because I think I told you about that the last time when I was on the show that they store. I have like 30

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       injections of my own stem cells stored down in Florida that I can use for, for joints, for anti aging. And I also, one of the reasons that I did that was if I'm ever in a car accident, if forever get some, some traumatic injury, I can, I can heal myself faster with these stem cells. And in that happened, I got a concussion. I was riding my bike and Austin on, on first street and in rush hour traffic in a car clipped me on the side and I made love to the pavement. My entire face got torn open. And uh, and I got a concussion, so I did all these things, have ketones, Dha, hyperbaric. I'm a PMF. That's also really, really good for concussions. Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy. Uh, it's, it's, uh, it, it, it's a used for anti-inflammatory, uh, for, uh, it's, it's used for sleep, you know, it's kind of like grounding and earthing.

Speaker 2:          00:36:27       There's a lot of interesting studies on PMF also for concussion. It enhances your own stem cell production. It shuts down neuroinflammation. So I did that, but then also a stem cells won't cross your blood brain barrier. So I ordered up this stuff called Mannitol, and if you inject mannitol into your bloodstream, it increases your blood brain barrier permeability. So this is what you do in a fight or a football player. Somebody gets a concussion, you inject with mannitol first, and then you follow that up with a stem cell injection. If the Mannitol is already in the bloodstream, the stem cells cross the blood brain barrier and they go into he'll neural tissue with the exosomes, cross the blood brain barrier because they're smaller, very small. They're very small. I think they're like 100 to 200 nanometers, which is pretty small and I would not be surprised if they cross the blood brain barrier as well.

Speaker 2:          00:37:14       One of the things that they were saying about stem cells versus exosomes that stem cells tend to get pulled up in the lungs. They don't pass the lungs and they get absorbed there and they believe that the exosomes being released by these stem cells are the reason why you generate regenerate tissue. They think that going straight to exosomes is going to be more efficacious than just going with stem cells. So I think that some pharmaceutical company or some supplement company is going to make a lot of money in the next 10 years by figuring out a way to, to make exosomes or figure out some way to do it in a way that is more available to the general population. Then, you know, harvesting it from placentas and you know, some crazy lab. So you weren't supposed to do anything for two weeks now for two weeks.

Speaker 2:          00:38:01       But I asked the doctor and I told them I was going to do a spartan race. He just said, proceed at your own risk, and in my plan, apparently few jar the joints a lot when they're already kinda weak from the surgery, you can risk tearing a ligament spraining straining, doing damage to a muscle that that's kind of weakened lax from the surgery, from the surgery, but is it a really a surgery because they're not cutting the the injection and I sprained my ankle within a few hours after, after waking up from the surgery, like I just kind of stumbled and it was extremely lax and almost like a, like a pregnant woman creates this hormone called relaxin right? And they get more flexible and they're able to give birth more quickly. It's kind of that

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       same idea is the joints, the joints and the ligaments become more lax. So my whole body felt a little bit more like, like Gumby. That's what that was. Why I taped up everything. You know, I had knee braces on an elbow braces and wrist braces and I felt fine during the race and this whole procedure was how many hours? It was about four hours. Four hours out. Cold Shit Up. What does it feel like when you wake up? Oh, there's a pretty funny video I posted. I thought it was funny. I was trying to speak French, so my wife, I'm like, I have a confession to make. And the doctor's like, Oh, here we go. I'm like, speak French. And then she. And then she asked me if I speak French. Nice. I didn't actually speak French and then you could see me trying to laugh, like it made a joke.

Speaker 1:          00:39:19       But you. Have you ever been sedated? Yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You're kind of loopy make up. Yeah. So I don't remember that much. But uh, and, and I still, I mean, I'll be honest with you, I don't notice much of a difference from any of this stuff. What's six weeks? Yeah, it's supposed to take a really long time before it really kicks in and it flares up. Old injuries were like kind of strained my upper hamstring when I played tennis and that's flared up. Uh, my left knee is flared up. Like I'm feeling old injuries that are most interesting. They almost like brought back, not flared up like it's red and inflamed and swollen, but I feel it. I feel my right ankle, which I strained a lot when I was, when I was playing tennis. That one feels, you know, it feels like I mentioned it's weak, it's paid.

Speaker 1:          00:39:58       It's going to be something they said that it could flare up old injuries that you'd feel worse before you feel better. Huh? That's interesting. I didn't hear that at all, but I did hear that six weeks, six weeks is the benchmark. It's a little bit of time before they actually feel better. Yeah. Yeah. The other interesting one, uh, for not only enhancing your own endogenous stem cell production because it actually would know a lot of this stuff. It's fringe. It's expensive. I mean, you know, that procedure, I think he's like a $30,000 procedure. Not Everybody's going to go out and do that and this is another fringe one, but I want to. I mean there are ways that you can endogenously increase your own stem cell production. I mean, in your own stem cell viability and health, without actually doing stem cell injections, I'm fasting is probably the the one that's the most efficacious in a lot of these things that are kind of uncomfortable for you seem to increase your body's ability to be able to heal or produce its own stem cells.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       So fasting for long periods of time. I'm not necessarily fasting with, with caloric restriction. I think that's the mistake a lot of people make. They try to fast and they feel like crap. But the idea is the benefits of fast and don't come from nodding a lot of calories, not even a lot of calories. Isn't that great for your thyroid is not great for your metabolism. You want to live till you're 120 and be cold and thin and hungry the whole time because it'd be a horrible way to live a long time. So the idea with, you know, things like, uh, you know, valter Longo is research or a lot of these, these, uh, intermittent fasting type of diets. As you fast and you increase cellular autophagy and stem cell production, your own stem cell production by going for long periods of time without eating

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       and the magic seems to kick in and about the 16 hour mark. So I do 12 to 16 hours every day and then you get even more benefit once you get up to about 24 hours. So I try to do a 24 hour fast from Saturday dinner to Sunday dinner, but I'm still eating the same number of calories. It's just a compressed feeding window. Right? So, so it's not like you're starving yourself, you're getting all the benefits of fasting, but you're still maintaining some amount of anabolic them, right? Because you're, you're still eating as many calories, but you're, you're almost giving your body, your gut in your metabolism a break in between a lot of these meals. And that's where the benefit comes from. That's where the Bennett, the benefits are not from, you know, not eating so much damn food. The benefits are going for a long time in between your feedings.

Speaker 2:          00:42:17       Right? So, so the idea is, you know, you, you'd wake up and in the population for which this seems to be the most deleterious, our lean active females, they do not respond well to these long fasts, are a lot of time spent doing intermittent fasting. It's like the cons outweigh the pro for that population. But for, for most everybody else, these 12 to 16 hour fast, preferably up to 16 hours going without eating and then eating as many calories as you'd normally eight with the exception rest the, the amount of calories and compressed feeding window. Right. So, um, you know, what, the guy whose house I was staying with her when I was doing the stem cell procedure, Dan pump, he's very into this stuff and, and he's, he's a doctor down in a park city and he just, he goes all day and then he has a huge dinner at the end of the day, right?

Speaker 2:          00:43:04       Like uh, an enormous lovely dinner, you know, a couple of glasses of wine and you know, stay thousands, 3000 calories for dinner. And I'm more of like a two meal, a light breakfast or light lunch. And then just two males, I've been doing the 12 to 14 hour thing and sometimes I have ramped it up to 16 hours and I do feel better when I do that and I, I definitely become more accustomed to not eating for long stretches. And sometimes when I wake up in the morning I almost think, should I just eat? But then I'll stop and go, well, I'm not really hungry. I mean it's really just a matter of habit, force of habit that I'm even considering eating right now. Yeah. Yeah. But. But fasting is probably one of the better ways to increase your own endogenous stem cell production. Provided you're going for about 16 hours and provided you're still eating as many calories as you would normally eat.

Speaker 2:          00:43:49       The only kind of caveat to that would be protein cycling. And this is why I'm not a huge fan of the reverse diet. Were eating four to six pounds of meat a day. Yeah, you were. I'm trying that for awhile. You're putting that on your social media. I sort of. But yet I was eating one of those big stakes every single night for dinner, just like a bunch of steak every single night for dinner, for how long? And this was like 10 days. Not that long. How'd you feel doing that? I felt pretty good. But uh, but I love steak. I was eating these bone in a bone in rib eyes. I ordered them up from a Missouri, I think is where their farms are, but they make these, a French cut grass fed grass finished bone in Ribeye steaks in there saying that I've got. I've remind me, I'll tell you how I cook them.

Speaker 2:          00:44:37       They will tell you how I cook them afterwards after we finished the silence because, because I didn't want to get because I'll, I'll just forget everything if I start talking about cooking because I love to prepare me. So, so real quick. Quite a few people that are doing this now. So real quick and then we'll talk about how to make these steaks tastes really good. Um, the, the idea is that protein cycling, right? Having a meatless Monday or having as a lot of religions would do like the eastern Orthodoxy Church or the Mediterranean Diet, they have certain periods of time where there's complete meet restriction or your protein intake is restricted to fish and eggs for example, and the idea is that you would strike a sweet spot between not being in a constantly anabolic state. Right? And and not having, having this mammalian target of rapamycin and constantly activated, which would theoretically accelerate aging or, or in, in a lot of rodent models.

Speaker 2:          00:45:29       We see that on restricted protein feeding actually causes aging to accelerate. So the idea is on your lower activity days, especially for an athlete, you could still intermittent fast and get all the benefits of that and you could still eat as many calories as you would need to sustain a normal healthy metabolism. Right? So, so you're not starving yourself, but on the less active days you would shift to a lower protein intake. Right? So you're talking about like zero point five grams per pound of body weight rather than what a typical athlete would need, which would be depending on. You asked. It was zero point seven to zero point eight, five grams per pound of body weight, right? So, so there's some days where you're high protein, some days where you're low protein, some periods of the week such as a meatless Monday or some periods of the year, you know, such as every quarter for a week where you're eating a plant based diet or you're restricting me, you're basically giving your body a break from being in that constant anabolic state.

Speaker 2:          00:46:22       And I think that the, the carnivore diet causes a lot of people to miss out on some of those elements. And then if you look at the blood work, have a um, a doctor who does die, he published his blood work online and I don't know what else is going on with them from a health standpoint but, but you know, he had really high blood glucose and really low testosterone and some things that suggest that it might not be healthy to just meet you know. And did you have really low testosterone? That's interesting. It was like 200 to $300. It's really low. It's really low. Diagnosable hypogonadism combined with a, uh, you know, almost like borderline diabetes did. Is it possible to do it after a workout? A, he does a lot of rowing for real high pressure testosterone. That's significantly. It would increase your HSC RP and your inflammatory markers. Right? Which is why you never want to. You never want to go to a doctor for a heart checkup after you've done a workout because they're going to tell you you're gonna have a heart attack based on the levels of HSC or p, but you know, that blood work is just one example and I don't want to pretend like that. One example is going to paint with a broad brush the entitlement carnivore

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       diet phenomenon, but I just, I think that unrestricted protein intake, an unrestricted meat intake probably has an accelerated aging effect on the body and well, here's the different Dr Ron Rosedale is a doc with some good information on that. He's got a good video online. What's going on with this carnivore diet is there's no science behind it. There's a lot of people that are giving it a shot, a lot of people finding good results, but I find that people, when they just change things, there's a period of time with a say they feel great and that is absolutely 100 percent of placebo effect. It's the same thing as like a Vegan Diet. You feel fantastic and named me, well, name me one population, one blue zone that eats meat and nothing else and there's. There's actually very few centenarians who are purely Vegan for their entire life because you can, if you don't do it the right way, build up fatty acid deficits, amino acid deficits.

Speaker 1:          00:48:22       Korea team is when you don't get vitamin B, 12 a Dha, but at least it's been studied. Corrine on Vegans, right? I been a lot of studies on vegans and we know that if you eat a like e three live, you know you. Oh you can. You can supplement it. There's a lot of really smart vegans. I mean those guys like rich roll, like they do things the right way, right? It's a lot easier to see the piece of meat to get some of the [inaudible] and some of the other amino acid you're trying to free up by soaking and sprouting and fermenting, which my wife does a lot of it, but I watch her like she. She's in the kitchen like three hours a day making vegetables bioavailable because you have to take her hours to make sourdough bread. Do you know, to actually make a bread where the gluten is pre digested and it's actually healthy in the glycaemic index is lower.

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       She's not Vegan. She's just a rancher girl and she likes to leave. We have goats and chickens and we eat meat but she. She's very into like an ancestral preparation of vegetables. You deactivating a lot of these, these stress or is that Dr Steven gundry talks about and you know before we part because we're talking about Tom Brady and how he does like a no night shade, no tomato, no potato, and I'd rather eat those things, but actually figuring out a way to render them more digestible and friendlier to the human body. Yeah. That's the other thing too, when people talk about food that has protein in it, um, you know, like Broccoli has so much protein, true, not really bioavailable to shit, ton of Broccoli. It's just not the same. Your body doesn't absorb it the same way it does it. Grass Fed rib eye steak. Yeah. Body absorbs that protein instantly knows exactly what he does.

Speaker 1:          00:49:56       Yeah. By the way, there, there was a study that just came out about stem cells. They found that carnosine, which you find in copious amounts in grass fed rib eye steak with blueberry extract, enhanced your stem cell production, and it was a hugely significant number. I don't remember the exact percentage but, but this combination of polyphenols and flavanols with meat is a good combo. That's why when I did the carnivore diet or not, the carnivore diet, that's when I was. When I was eating meat, I was doing lots of salads. I was doing lots of. I had like wild blueberry powder. I had these vegetable powders, you know, I was doing a lot of big salads for lunch, flavanols, polyphenols, any of that same thing with the high saturated fat diet, a high saturated fat diet, like the whole coconut oil thing is highly inflammatory in the absence of plant polyphenols and flavonols, which is why if you're doing a high fat ketonic diet, it needs to be a plant rich, high fat ketotic Diet.

Speaker 1:          00:50:52       Otherwise things on those lines. You can get a lot of your friends. I mean Avocados, yes, but I'm talking about more like you're doing coconut oil, butter and you know, avocado, chocolate pudding and all these thing. You know, your Keto genic fat bombs and all these recipes that are out there, but he got. He had a lot of plants. Even in the animal kingdom, you see animals and they rip up another animal, like a carnivorous animal. They're in the intestines and the reading. A lot of the organs that are chock full of what grass plants or herbs, whatever. That omnivorous animal that the carnivorous animal is eating predicted. Exactly, exactly. When you're talking about carnivorous diets, the real issue that I have with it is there's almost no research other than Dr Baker doing those tests on himself, which, uh, according to you are not very promising.

Speaker 1:          00:51:38       I didn't. I have some friends that are trying it. My friend Jordan Peterson, his daughter had some serious anti, some serious immune system issues, autoimmune disorders, and like to the point where she's had a, she's, I believe she's like 30, 31 set of hip replaced. She's about to get one of her ankles replaced, like serious arthritis. Real problems. The only thing that's been able to clear that up as meat, just a pure meat diet. So with some people, but she might have some, I wouldn't say the only pages allergic reaction to plants. I mean there might be something. The meat wasn't the medicine. Probably the elimination of whatever she was saying. She might have some sort of a, a, a real serious problem, some sort of allergic reaction to some plants or to gluten and maybe a bunch of different ways. A lot of these diets are right.

Speaker 1:          00:52:30       Yeah. It's, it's the elimination, not the magic of just eating me mean, but Sean Baker keeps going on and on about how meat, heels and meet this and meet that all carnivorous diet and you know, all these people trying it like man, it's got a lot of good stuff going for it. But, but restriction of plant matter, in my opinion, long term is not a good idea and eating meat all the time long term is not necessarily a good idea. And eating only plants with the absence of some meat based protein is for a lot of populations. Not that great of an idea. Yeah. Well that's the point is that for most people you're going to have to experiment a little bit to figure out what works best for you. And there are people that, especially if you use e three live and algae and get your [inaudible] vitamins and your fat soluble vitamins, you can live off of Vegan Diet.

Speaker 1:          00:53:16       It can be done, but you really have to be careful about it. But then there's other people where they can't and and, and you really have to figure out what the fuck is going on with the carnivore thing to me is kinda tweaking me out because I just don't. It's like they start talking about the poisons and Fido toxins and all these things that are in plants that are bad for it. I'm like, okay, but the issue with Dennis mild hormetic exercise is bad for you. Sunlight's bad for all that stuff because it's going to say for a medic stressor is that your body responds to that in a positive way. Even show that some of the, some of the rodents outside of Chernobyl are living longer from the radiation. And I'm not saying like go, go move your cabinet next to a nuclear disaster website.

Speaker 1:          00:53:59       But the idea is that's a hormetic stressor. Mild amounts of UVA and UVB. Yes. Every day I actually, every single day I do cold. Every single day I do hot. If I'm not in the sauna that I'm wearing more clothes than I would normally wear when I go to the gym to get my, get my heart rate up and actually get myself into the discomfort of hot for the heat shock protein and the nitric oxide. Everything else, so that does for you in the discomfort of cold because it's a hormetic stress or they're doing tests right now at Harvard, so it's fast yoga and trying to figure out if hot yoga has the same hermetic stress response as I'm sauna because they know there's been quite a bit of work done on. It's very equivalent physiologically. Yeah. I mean I don't do the full choreographed 90 minute Bikram Yoga, but I have one of these big Saunas.

Speaker 1:          00:54:45       It's like it's a four person sauna and if I go in there by myself, I can do in down dog and pushups and I'd take these, uh, these cats who blood flow restriction devices in there and do pushups and squats. And those are the research behind those for muscle maintenance. With bodyweight training, it's very intriguing. I travel with them everywhere. These, these cats who training devices and I just tie them like tourniquets on my arms around my legs and they do a lot of studies and seniors for muscle maintenance without the need for as much joint impact, but what happens is you get micro damage to the capillaries, you get a big release of lactic acid which causes you to produce more growth hormone after the workout. I mean in my opinion, for bodyweight training, like at this point, Katsu training like doubles. Yeah, I've heard that before.

Speaker 1:          00:55:31       I haven't really gotten into it, but I'm very big on the sauna to the point where obviously we have one here at the studio that he used all the time. I just think it's, you know, those stressors that they're talking about as being a negative thing with eating vegetables. I just don't buy it. I just don't buy it. People have been eating vegetables forever. I don't think they're bad access or in people like your friend with the immune system issue or people with leaky gut or damage. There might be a period of time where you actually have to be careful and really careful with gluten, which is a digestive stress or uh, and again, even that in small amounts, it's probably good for you. They've been shown that kids who get gluten restricted when their kids wind up having more issues with gluten later on in life because their guts might be weaker.

Speaker 1:          00:56:14       Right? But, but yeah, lectins and plant phytochemicals and a lot of things that plants use to poison mammals are two, cause they're their seeds to be digested and pass out through the digestive tract and the stool of the mammals. They can grow elsewhere. A lot of that stuff really is, you know, it, it, it, it makes you stronger. You ever had that coffee? Kopi Luwak you ever had that stuff is the stuff. Yeah, the, the cat, the Lemur coffee and shits it out and then they take the coffee and sell it at this outrageous rate. It's actually delicious. Ferments coffee man, that's very nice. But your elephants do to black, black, ivory caught your eye. That shit. I don't want to like support the ELA. I don't give a fuck about lemurs. I don't. It's a Lima. I think it's harvesting coffee beans from elephant poop sounds far more laborious than than harvesting.

Speaker 1:          00:57:05       Shuttles are lemurs. Just hose it down. Get better. Bang for your book is titled One little. It's like a needle in a haystack, right? If it's just a few coffee beans and the trial elephant shit, get jacked up. Coffee. The elephant elephants chasing you. You're digging through their shit, chasing you through the field. Plus they probably shit like crazy. Just like a person doesn't eat coffee. I give them some, uh, lte and there it is. What it is. Those are coffee tourists. That's almost like a bunch of coffee beans with a few pieces of Turd thrown it. Yeah. Look at that. Bam. Son was almost looot coffee, so they just feed them nothing but coffee and they shared it out sort of like we should out corn and can't really digest it properly. There's a fermentation process that makes the bean tastes better. My problem with the carnivore diet is my same problem that I have with the Vegan Diet.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       Is it? I don't think they're being scientific or objective about it. I being dogmatic it's becomes an ideology and the ideology is the meat heels and meets this and meet that and meet is the thing and like no meat is one part of a good diet, one part of a healthy diet and again, for some people there's some people that have. I'm sure you aware of the lone star tick, you know about that. Right? What about it? Do you know about me down? Allergies? No. Lone Star tick is a tick that bites people and gives them an allergy to red meat. It's horrible for Texas. Yes, yes, but it's spreading. It's spreading across the country. See, all we have up in my land is a ticks that as long as you get them off within 24 hours, that doesn't allow them to produce the saliva that would make them release their hold on your skin and it's that that produces yellow fever, not the actual tick bite itself.

Speaker 1:          00:58:47       So you don't get a lot of lime up where I'm at, but I've never heard of this loan. Slime as much more prevalent on the east coast, it's starting to make its way out here. There have been some lyme cases out here in California, but this lone star tick is, um, it's a real problem and it's giving people. It's something called Alpha Gal Alpha Alpha, short for Alpha, Gao Alpha, less shadows that sugar. So here it is, it makes you allergic to hot dogs. Alpha Alpha one, three. Galactose. Alpha Gals, the most mammalian cell membranes. The allergy doesn't extend to non mammalian meat. Poultry and seafood are all fine, which is really interesting. So you, you can't, once you get this shit, you're just, you're allergic to this Alpha galactose. But you could eat eight and human meat according to the article. So you're not allergic to those pig.

Speaker 1:          00:59:42       I wonder if pork. Welcome a million doubt it. So could he ate meat? So if you want to go to the jungle and have what they call a bushmeat credit. Okay. Speaking of me. Ribeye steaks. Yes. This is how to make these Ribeye steaks taste really good. So what I do on on the rub is like a really core salt, use a salt called Colima salt, super high in minerals, really kosher salt course. Now it's different. They harvested from the Mexican coast and it tastes fabulous. It's really good. What's a girl? Only salts I travel with and Boz is Kalema salt and then this stuff. I am a c o, l I m a and Black Kona salt black Kona salt from. From China. From Hawaii. Yeah. I use that when I cook some of the meat from Hawaii just because it seems right. It does.

Speaker 1:          01:00:27       He use salt from. From, from the, from the volcanoes in Hawaii. So. And I rub a Cayenne black pepper salt and then to reduce the carcinogens that conform when you cook me either time or rosemary or both or just rubbed thyme or Rosemary Reduces carcinogens there. And Dennis. Yeah, they reduced. They reduced the formation of a, I think they call them polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These, these, you know, things that form on the meat when you black in the meat because you want to get a good crisp sphere on the inside of the meat, so it's nice and crunchy on the outside. She was strict. A lot of the unhealthy effects of doing that. When you get some kind of an urban there like that, so you take out the. You get to room temperature, you put this rubbing, you take a cast iron skillet, so I'll do it on the grill at all.

Speaker 1:          01:01:09       It's a cast iron skillet. You heat up the cast iron skillet in the oven and then you take it out of the oven and you put it on the stove top. You put the stove top on medium high and either use an extra virgin olive oil. A have used lard before. Why do you use, although what has a low flashpoint gives me a good put no extra virgin. Olive oil has a bunch of antioxidants in it, so it's actually guernseys as higher resistance to that. He never burnt. Never an issue. It doesn't burn, doesn't smoke, but when they see or things, that's one thing they tell you is never use olive oil. Well, I use extroversion all. I'm part of an olive oil clubs, so maybe it's because I have really good olive oil. They shipped me three bottles of olive oil every quarter from a different pool that or find that out because I've really read don't cook things at high heat with olive oil.

Speaker 1:          01:01:57       Look it up, even extra virgin olive oil. At this point, all I can tell you is the shots, how you're speaking. You're saying hi. He said medium heat and this says medium heat too, so maybe that's the difference is the high heat maybe, but when you're searing I would assume that it is kind of. It's not on there for very long. Anyways, extra virgin olive oil into the pan. Heat up the olive oil and you put it on for maybe two minutes Max on the cast iron skillet. You heat up the olive oil, then you put the steak on and you do exactly for a perfect medium rare three and a half minutes. One side, three and a half minutes. The other side. Then you take it out on this is where you get there. Probably about that thick. What is that? Oh yeah, we're on audio.

Speaker 1:          01:02:39       It's about an inch and a half. So anyways, the um, it's like when you asked me in the last podcast how big my dick got after I inject it with about that big, not that big. So anyways, the uh, then then you put it in to the oven, you take that entire cast iron skillet, you put the oven on Broil and you broil it for one minute on one side and then you turn it over and you do one minute on the other side and then you take it out of the oven and you finish it with butter. Meaning when you take it out of the oven, you just take the steak off the cast iron skillets, shove it aside, just put on a plate, whatever. And you take a pad of butter and you can infuse the butter, right? You can, you can use like garlic infused butter would just use a plain old grassfed butter.

Speaker 1:          01:03:21       You put a pat of butter on the skill that you let the butter just get to the point where it's melted a little bit and it's not Super Brown. You put the stake back on top of the butter, put the burner back on, and you finish it one minute each side. Let it off. Let it rest. Three or four minutes. That technique is the best technique for the most perfect steak you'll ever have. It sounds very good. Is really good. That sounds very good. It's really good. Mostly what I do is the reverse sear method with a pellet grill. I keep it at about 250 degrees. You ever used a pellet grill? Well, like about pellet grills is you're getting an appellate socially a similar horrible. You're, you're essentially getting hardwood that's compressed. So what, when they cut hardwood, like for um, let's table it would take the oak and the saw dust, they would compress into these small pellets and there's a bunch of different companies, uh, triggers a, a good one.

Speaker 1:          01:04:12       They, they, they make one for the good girls. Yeah. They have good grills and they also make one that you could use with an APP. What I like about it is you can control the temperature completely with your phone. There's a thing called a timberline is one of their new ones. Um, so anyway, you get these compressed pellets and they go into a hopper and then there it is right there. That's a. What is that one of the woodwind? That's where a pellet stove look like when I was growing up. So the pellets go into the hopper and then at the bottom there's a gear, like a worm drive that feeds the pellets into that fire at the bottom, comes from an element, so the element and then there's a fan. So once it's lit, the element shuts off and then the fire is stoked by this fan and it's all temperature controlled.

Speaker 1:          01:04:53       Like very, very precisely. One of the good things, what I like about this trigger that I've seen is that it seals up like a, um, like a yeti cooler. Like it's very insulated and fixed. So it's really good at retaining the perfect temperature. And again you can do it on your phone. So I get it to 250 degrees. Then mostly what I'm cooking is wild game, low fat content. And so you don't want to make sure you don't dry it out. So I took it at a low temperature. I'm cooking a 250 degrees. I get it to an internal temperature of 120 the once it hits 120, I pull it out. And you've got to open up the grill, the test, your internal temp wire. Now I have a wireless wire wire, wireless thermometer that's connected to it and it's outside the circle. We see it and that's like what my dry aging has and it's also, it lets me know, it gives you a beep when it hits 1:20.

Speaker 1:          01:05:41       So I know I go and get it. So I pull it out technical. Then I pull it out of there and I use this cast iron skillet as well. But I cook with grass fed butter. So I take the cast iron skillet, I put it probably same temperature, medium, high heat. And again, when I'm got the steak on the, on the grill itself, I'm using sea salt and crushed black pepper and garlic powder. That's what I usually use. No black end extra. No, no. I'm going to try now. I'm. So then I take it off of there and then I use grass fed butter in a cast iron skillet once it's heated up. I sear it on both sides for about a minute and a half and then I let it rest depending if I'm an ambitious, sometimes I'll let it rest a, cover it with aluminum foil and put it in a Yeti cooler and I'll let it sit in that Yeti cooler for about 10 minutes and I pull it out and it is just too cold.

Speaker 1:          01:06:28       After 10 minutes, the Yeti cooler now to the Yeti Cooler, the Yeti cooler maintains the temperature. The stakes we should have. My wife just texted shopping stakes yoder, yoder pellet grill in the band, a cast iron pan. I mean that's the reverse sear method. The idea is that I'm cooking it to a perfect internal temperature of 120 degrees, which will raise both in the Yeti, the Yeti Cooler, and also from the Siri on the outside, so once I get the cast iron pan heated up to a medium high heat, I throw that butter in there and I see her the shit out of the outside for again, about a minute and a half. Both sides wrap it in foil, put it in the Yeti Cooler for 10 minutes. It maintains its temperature and it continues slowly cooking so that it gets it somewhere around 1:35 ish, which is what I like. I take that back very precise.

Speaker 1:          01:07:17       This is even more precise. This is like the sound effects is like beep, beep, beep. I was cooking steak. Well, I'm a big fan of these pellet grills because you get this real smoky flavor to your food that comes from hardwood, but there's no chemicals. They compressed the hardwood sawdust just with natural sugars. The natural sugars in the sawdust and you know, there's a bunch of different companies. There's a green mountain grill. Makes a good grill. I got to yoga at home. I really like. Again, trager is really good. Most of my friends are using triggers because they this temperature control thing and the apps are so good to be able to use it on your phone. I'm a big fan. Yeah. Wow. That's amazing. Yeah. I liked the fact that you can use good. You said it and you could just walk the fuck away from it too and it's going to smoke your meat at 250 degrees and it has a good rich, that smoky flavor, whether it's Hickory or cherry, you know, whenever you choose. The only thing that I have to do, I don't know why I'm like this with a steak because I still need to dip it in something in the same way that you dip a prime rib and horseradish. You stone mustard.

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       I did my statement. You know like the stone mustard with a little little texture to it. That's perfect. That's perfect. I know it's fricking the middle of the day on a Tuesday and I'm hungry to [inaudible] last night and had steak. That's a good spot. Was it was good. I had a fascinating, fascinating discussion about artificial sweeteners there with uh, one of the guys who runs quest nutrition and was talking about Tom said no, it wasn't Tom, it was Ron Ron Pena and, and he was drinking diet coke and we were talking about some of the studies out there on assets will family potassium and the potential for neurotoxicity or sucralose to cause things like, uh, you know, microbiome issues, the death of bacteria in the gut. And he was explaining how the amount of artificial sweeteners using that study was just like way far in excess of what you get from a diet soda and that what they call the increase in response like, like that, that spiking of the appetite that is attributed sometimes to the consumption of artificial sweeteners only occurs in people who aren't used to artificial sweetener consumption.

Speaker 2:          01:09:22       And once they've kind of gotten into like a, like a diet coke habit that now this is all Brendan is like 12 hours ago. Right? So I started drinking diet coke and I do know they use artificial sweeteners, so bars. And so yeah, some of that planet as well, but he said you could take a shower in diet coke and you wouldn't get sticky because there's that. That's such a small amount of artifice. It's like a dusting of artificial sweeteners. So actually it's, it's, it's making. I haven't delved into the research yet, but it's at least made me think last night about reconsidering my stance because what I usually do is I just use Stevia and like Pellegrino, like my refrigerator. Just full of Pellegrino. You ever try z? Because I do a lot. I love to love that shit. I love it. Yeah. I drink the shit out of trouble the other day because I'm so busy.

Speaker 2:          01:10:09       I was doing that spartan life feed announcing and they're sponsored by a, a fit aid. Right. And then they cut to camera and I had a big oldZ via. There were supposed to be pretending we're drinking that night or whatever. They'd take the TVA down. Fitted. I don't know. It's a, it's A. I think it's a God proteolytic enzymes in it. I think that's the main thing. I could be confusing that with kill cliff. That's the other kind of flies off. We've got a bunch of those proteins which are great. They break down fibrinogen. They're wonderful for recovery. These enzymes, and I don't know how many of them they have just like that. A blood orange kill cliff [inaudible]. Use it as a marinade for wild pork. Holy Baby Jesus. That's like beer can chicken. Well, that's one of the things I wonder if that's. Well, proteolytic enzymes.

Speaker 2:          01:10:56       One of the reasons they work as they break down fibrinogen and they're almost like an enzyme, right? That same thing. If you have no marinade and nothing and all the tenderize me, you get your digestive enzymes, your, you're on it. Gut Pack or whatever you have around and you break open the capsules and you sprinkle that on top. The meat. It's like, uh, it's like, uh, you know, free suggests j almost, right? With lemon and lime fish. It's a phenomenal marinade for meat. That's cliff orange. I'm guessing. Kill cliff is good too. Yeah. It's just so, so delicious. And you're getting very little sugar. Yeah. No, it's just, it's just deliciousness. Oh yeah, yeah, but I go with Pellgrino. Pellgrino is less acidic and perrier and it has a lot of sodium bicarbonate in. It doesn't, I don't know if you looked into these studies on baking soda for Athletic Performance and its ability to be able to buffer lactic acid.

Speaker 2:          01:11:47       It's a, it's a potent ergogenic aid, but the problem is that it causes gut distress when you take as much as they use in a lot of these studies and so more, more and more what the studies are doing, your dosing right with, with small amounts of baking soda for two to three hours leading into your workout. So my philosophy is this, if Pellegrino has pretty high levels of sodium bicarbonate in it, which it does, it's got more sodium bicarbonate in it and any of the other bottled waters like twice as much as Gerald Steiner and you know, any of these other waters out there. I'm kind of dosing with a little bit of a lactic acid buffer all day long. So anytime I want to jump into a workout, I'm able to push myself a little bit harder. Do you notice a difference? Yeah, I know zero Pellegrino studies on this, but do you notice a difference physically between not feel amazing when I drink that stuff all day?

Speaker 2:          01:12:31       I drink that and I drink this. Uh, uh, it's, it's hydrogen enriched water, a molecular hydrogen. This, this foundation called the molecular hydrogen foundation. They do studies on the antiinflammatory and antioxidant potential of water that has a lot of hydrogen ions in it. It's called hydrogen rich water. And the cool part about that is that, and I, the only other thing I know of that can do this or green tea, polyphenols is they act as an anti inflammatory post-exercise without blunting the hormetic response, that positive beneficial stressful response where you're talking about with exercise and so you can have your cake and eat it too, right? You get your antioxidants, you shut down inflammation and it doesn't blunt. In this case, the hormetic response to exercise would be the proliferation of satellite cells and the production of new Mitochondria, which why you shouldn't take a bunch of vitamin C and Vitamin E and some of these high antioxidant compounds.

Speaker 2:          01:13:27       Post workout, same reason. You shouldn't do a cold bath postworkout and the idea is that hydrogen rich water allows you to shut down inflammation with once again, why shouldn't you take a cold bath pulse workout and is there a certain period of time where they think you should, you could, but it's the period of time to adjust for me. I go two or three hours for it. And as far as some people say don't, don't jump into the cold bath 15 minutes after an hour cryo chamber. According to Rhonda, I wait two or three hours and I don't. I don't know if, if Rhonda is basing that on research or if it's an extrapolation or or what, but I wait a couple hours now that the exception to that rule is that if you exercise any closer than three hours to bedtime, it elevates body temperature to the point where it affects your deep sleep cycles.

Speaker 2:          01:14:21       Right? So, and one reason for that is because your core temperature is elevated. So for me, if I do an evening workout and I do, you know, hard later afternoon, early evening workouts, quite often I will still take a cold shower. I actually have a giant claw. I bought one of those endless pools, you know, like those fitness pools that you swim in and I keep it out in the forest behind my house and it's just chock full of cold water. We talked about that. Jump in there. I love that idea, but it decreases your core temperature and allows you to sleep better later on if you do that after an evening workout. So even though it probably restricts the efficacy of the workout a little bit, that's my. Yeah. My reasoning is that I'm going to sleep way better and the benefits I get from a good solid nights sleep outweigh any loss of benefit from decreasing a little bit of that mitochondrial density and in satellite cell proliferation.

Speaker 2:          01:15:11       So when you're doing this late night workout out how far, like how long before you sleep you're doing. What research has shown is that it's ideal to finish a hard workout within three hours before bedtime. If you don't want to, if you don't want to mess up your sleep exactly, but with your cold bath you could probably mitigate some of you and I go to bed pretty early. I usually go to bed about but usually 9:30 9:45 AM in bed reading and I'm asleep around 10, 10, 30. So if I'm not finishing up a workout until like 7:30, which is the case sometimes you not finish work. I'm not getting into the workout until like 6:45, seven. Like sometimes I'm working out closer to bedtime three hours. So in that case I'll do the cold shower, did a podcast recently with Dr Matthew Walker about sleep and it's kind of changed the way I feel about sleep and the importance of it and how much, how much you need.

Speaker 2:          01:15:59       I think you can just power through and get through with like three, four hours at night. You'd be fine. You can, yeah. But it fucks you up. Well there's, there's exceptions to that. I mean, some people have, this I think is the d, c to gene that allows you to actually get by on a lot less sleep. Some members of the population has that gene. It's a very small member of the population. Small moment. But furthermore there's this guy named Dr Luke Huddle. Nick little hills is his name. I could have really messed up. They didn't know Dick Middle Hails. Anyways, he's um, he, he's got this concept. He works with a lot of these European soccer teams and what he looks at is not the seven to nine hours of sleep, not how many hours of sleep per night you get, but the number of sleep cycles right from stage one to stage five sleep that you get throughout the course of the week.

Speaker 2:          01:16:47       Meaning you're supposed to get 31 to 35 sleep cycles over seven days. And so you might get three sleep cycles one night and five sleep cycles and other night. And he also, I haven't seen research to back this up, but this is what he does with his athletes. His, he counts a 20 to 30 minute power nap as a sleep cycle, so technically you could sleep four hours night and then you could do a eight hour sleep night on a Saturday and a 20 minute nap on a Sunday and then you add up all your sleep cycles and you can use any self quantification device to if you want to actually measure how many times you're. You're cycling during the during a night of sleep and you look at that instead of am I getting a consistent seven to nine hours of sleep a night?

Speaker 2:          01:17:28       Look at the total sleep. I, I literally just wrote an article about this this morning on my website. You should listen to the podcast with Matthew Walker because he's pretty in depth about what is, what's recommended and why and the risk of Alzheimer's for people to get less than five hours sleep a night and I'm asleep. But are you getting every night? I am for 24 hour cycles, getting about eight hours, which means like if I sleep seven hours, I take a 20 to 45 minute nap and that sounds perfect. I'm a big napper and my naps are very elaborate. Well, you're also. You work extremely hard. Yeah, I mean I'm not, I'm, I'm not working out as hard as some of these pro athletes who are like 10 hours of sleep per night Friday, but for the average person, oh, these normatec boots that I lay in these, these great aided compression boots that kind of move the compression from the ankle all the way up to the hips and I lay on this bio mat which is like laying on a warm teddy bear.

Speaker 2:          01:18:25       It's like this map that makes infrared rays, so it's just like an infrared radiation matt, almost like a sauna. And then I've got these, these binaural binaural beat. It's, it's an artificial intelligence based audio that confuses your brain and lulls you into this. This total state of relaxation. It's called Brain FM. So I lay on my back and I've got the boots on and I have the mat on and I notice every. Now I'm sounding like a, like a princess now, but I have. I have an assistant who lives at my house and she really helps out with a lot of stuff. She does the banking and she helps out with bringing stuff to the post office and you know, she's just, she's just there whenever I need her to do stuff and you know, she helps. She's back home with the kids right now, so she just kind of like a live in assistant and everyday about 1230 or one, she goes up to my bed, she lays out the biomass, she plugs it in and she pushed it on my temperature.

Speaker 2:          01:19:20       She lays out the NORMATEC boots. She pushed the pillow out with a sleep mask and the headphones and then I just go up there after lunch and I lay down for about 45 minutes and I'm just dead to the world. That's a pretty sweet setup. It's, it's a good setup. That's fine. Live. It's a good person like that that you trust. Yeah, exactly. It's crazy. So the idea was sleep though is yeah, if you, if you nap and if you pay closer attention to the number of sleep cycles that you get each week, I think that's more important than getting like seven to nine hours a night. How would you know how many sleep cycles? Unless you're monitoring it, you usually have or is that what you're monitoring with? Yeah, he use when he's in the ring is pretty accurate. I mean it's a, it's not as accurate as a sleep lab study, but it's, it's accurate. Kevin rose tried to get me to wear one of those things. Yeah, big. They've got another one that's smaller, but

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       it seems very start the sentence like, yeah, exactly. I need a lot of necklaces and Blaine to go along with it. But it works. I found it in Finland like four years ago and I bought it and I really have been using it ever since. It does like my sleep temperature. Oh that's. Yeah, that's, that's the littler one. Smarter, get more restorative whatever. Oh yeah. Yeah. The Mora. Ooh. I wish I'd have invested in the company because they seem to be everywhere now and and help. They were there. I was at a Finland of biohacking conference and there was this tiny little table with one guy at salon, this little ring and all of a sudden it's just like kind of diamond. Are those diamonds? I don't quit. Is that light? I don't know if they're real. What's that? Are they trying to say it's bling bling, blitz diamond, linking it up, let them bitches know, but it's kind of cool because you can pull up your body temperature during the night so a woman could use this to tracker cycles.

Speaker 1:          01:21:05       It will tell you your heart rate variability, which I used to measure every morning when I wake up, I look at my parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system score and then I'd be able to tell if I should do a hard workout that day or each day. Well now the range is. It measures it all during the night like it does with the five minute measurements throughout the night while I'm asleep so I wake up, I can get a running average of my guitars on your smartphone or. And then it, it pairs that with like how hard I worked out the day before and my heart rate, my body temperature, and then it tells me here's your readiness score. So if my readiness score is at like 60 percent, then I'm going to go in the sauna and do yoga. Right. And if my writing or scores had 90, I'll do.

Speaker 1:          01:21:41       I'll go out and do the obstacle course at my house and swinging bells and, and beat up the body a little bit more. So it's pretty useful because it ever had 100. I've never seen it. 100. What would that mean? Like why? Why wouldn't it be better if I took a two hour nap on the mat with the boots and probably get to 100. Those normatec boots, they send them to me. I sent it to my friend Cam Cameron Hanes, but he, he runs a lot of you. Have you seen for arm they haven't for the arms and the hips to be like a giant marshmallow man, what does it do? I would imagine if if you do a lot of upper body activity, like maybe you're a pitcher, maybe a swimmer. Yeah, box or someone who's doing a lot of upper body activity that the arms would be efficacious.

Speaker 1:          01:22:21       Curtis, yeah. They look kind of silly and they're kind of hard to get on by herself, so I would be one more thing for my assistant to have to help me with. What is it doing? Again, it's graded compression, so it's apparently a form of compression that they've patented. Unlike a lot of the other boots out there to where it the first time it inflates. It measures the diameter of your limbs and then bases every subsequent compression to be customized to the diameter or the girth of your limbs and pump the blood. In this case, if you're wearing the feet or the leggings from your ankles all the way up to your hips, you got a picture with him. It was that Loma Chenko and those one of those earlier pictures. No, it was another one earlier than that. It works. I mean your legs feel light as a feather.

Speaker 1:          01:23:10       FGL used them. Yeah. And so this compression, like as it's doing the compressing it, what is it doing to the legs by just compressed? Just pumping. It's pumping blood like up, up and away from all the extremities and, and just moving it around. Veterans at the idea? No, it's moving it back up to your heart. Just circulating blood throughout your body. So it's almost like an additional heart. It's like a massage, like a massage, but we'll know if it seems more hard is not a pump then. It's not like an additional. The horseshoe. Yeah. Anyways though. So it's, they, they work though and they're incredibly relaxing. It's, it's almost like someone's massaging you to do watch TV with. Well you can kill two birds with one stone. Ooh. Oh Wow. He's got the full meal deal. This guy has, he's got legs on now. This is a little bit it, it could, it could get expensive to do that because now you've got to have to inflation units rather than just one because you can't plug them all in at once.

Speaker 1:          01:24:09       So that's a spendy setup. But that's the UFC featherweight champion later. Well, if he's the UFC featherweight champ, he can, he can afford the Cadillac of marshmallow man suits. Well, he's at Honolulu. Cryotherapy getting his freak on. That's what a lot of these crowd therapy, uh, centers have noticed. They've got the walking cryotherapy, they've got the NORMATEC boots, they've got the vibration platform so you can lose weight while you're standing there in the vibration platform. Yeah. Learned a lot of fat. What do you think about those things? So it was um, ultrasonic things, you know, I'm talking about what are those called? Turbo Sonics. You ever seen those verified vibration platform that they go through like a whole cycle? Like they'll do it. When I was in park city, I did one of those. Yeah. Great Dude. I had to go take a shit right after.

Speaker 1:          01:24:58       Seriously? No, I'm serious. I was on that thing for like eight minutes and I said, excuse me, and I had a glorious dump afterwards, so I have, I have, uh, a mini trampoline at my house and I jump up and down on that thing in the mornings and it gets everything moving. Yeah. That's like my one two combo for having a really good dump in the mornings is there's this herbal blend called try Phala t r I p h a l a and I put about a half teaspoon of that into a competent super bitter. So I put some Stevia in there or something to sweeten it up a little bit and I pour the hot water over that. And you have that at night right before I go to bed. And you wake up in the morning and you could use the vibration platform. You could do the, uh, the Tai Chee bouncing. That's another thing some people will do. We just kind of bounce up and down like this script programming or you can, you can jump on a trampoline, probably skip rope too. And that one, two combo just gets things moving amazingly. Yeah. I have a couple double espressos before that too. Yeah, and I do. I did a hot cup of coffee in the morning. I don't put anything in my coffee black, but my. My Protocol

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       for staying lean your rod is because I used to be 215 pounds and I had to shut a lot of weight to get into iron man triathlon so that an iron man triathlon for about eight years and the way that I stayed lien for races. You get up in the morning and have a cup of coffee or green tea because both of those can help to mobilize fatty acids from adipose tissue and you do this when you're in that fasted state that I was talking about. Right? So you wake up after a 12 to 16 hour fast and you take the cup of coffee or the green tea. Then you go exercise or move a robotically for whatever time you have available at 20 to 45 minutes. Doesn't have to be that long and the reason that you do at aerobically is because when you wake up in the morning, you already have a lot of cortisol in your system, right?

Speaker 2:          01:26:44       There's, there's no need to just stress yourself out even more by doing a very hard workout. I like to ease my way into the day. I like a non stressful morning unless I've got a very busy day and I know that I'm not going to get hard work at any other time. I say my hard workout for the later afternoon or early evening. When your body temp peaks and your grip strength peaks and your postworkout reaction time or your post workout protein synthesis peaks your, uh, your reaction time peaks like, like your body is very equipped to do a hard workout in the afternoon and the evening more than it is in the morning. Well, the way you can really tell his Jujitsu, my Jujitsu training in the morning, I'm way weaker. Just don't feel the same in the afternoon. You have much more energy. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 2:          01:27:26       So the, uh, the idea is also when you do a hard workout in the morning, you get a lot of times postworkout caloric compensation men and you just want to eat everything in sight until fricking lunch. You're just, you're just hungry. And part of this probably physical because you empty your glycogen stores more quickly and part of it probably is mental, right? Like I fucking punished it this morning. I just, uh, deserve to, you know, have, have a few extra slices of bread for lunch. So the, uh, the idea is I get up, I do the coffee and then I'll do the 20 to 45 minutes of easy movement and that might be the yoga in the sauna. It'll be a walk in the sunshine. So I'm getting my vitamin D and I'll do like breath work, you know, where I'll breathe in through my nose and do breath hold.

Speaker 2:          01:28:06       So I'm still kind of making my body better, but I'm not stressing it out with a lot of east centric muscle tissue damage. And then I finish up that whole session with a cold shower. So I'm getting a lot of those benefits of white adipose tissue to Brown fat conversion in the absence of any inflammation, right? Inflammation and calories keep the white fat from getting converted into Brown fat, which is what you want when you're doing a cold shower, a cold soak or some kind of cold thermogenesis and I'm able to stay super lean with that protocol. You get up caffeine aerobics exercise in a fasted state, you finish up with a cold and I mean even if you weren't working out, you can stay pretty lean with that type of protocol and this is what you did specifically to try to lose weight to go from when you were buying originally to just shed muscle.

Speaker 2:          01:28:52       And then I would do really long catabolic chronic cardio endurance workouts, which are not that great for you. Right. But I was just let you know, I would go, let's try a low rise. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. So when you were doing this, we, you calorie restricting as well, like take these. Oh it's calorie restricting or you'd go to bed at night and he'd be staring at the ceiling hungry. I guess it's, yeah, you're trying to lose weight, right? So your body start to weight ratio. Your body starts eating yourself. Now for these, for these fasts and workouts, if you are going to have facet hard workout in the morning, you can stay. You can stay anabolic, but relatively non insulinogenic without spiking your blood glucose too heavily with something like amino acids, right? So it's like a lot of people will do a branch chain amino acid or an essential amino acid.

Speaker 2:          01:29:36       You elevate your blood levels of amino acids, keeps you anabolic, it allows you to stave off central nervous system fatigue, keeps you from shedding too much muscle and you just spike your blood levels of amino acids and then go into your workout and you could even throw something like ketones into the mix too. So that's like a very hypo caloric way to get a pre workout in without actually getting a lot of calories. And at the same time, and we were talking before the podcast about we were talking about different athletes and diets and things on those lines and you were saying that you don't think it's good idea for a pro athlete, particularly like a basketball player to be on a Ketogenic ketogenic diet. Yeah, I, I don't think that a strict ketogenic diet is a good strategy. I think that is cyclic ketogenic diet would be the way to go for something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:30:19       Yeah. Zack bitter. And that's exactly what I do is I'll eat almost zero carbohydrates the entire day. Plants, starches and fats. I think I told you about my morning smoothie you the last time I was on and it's just, you know, like coconut milk and bone broth and these precursors to nad, which is another very, very. That probably next to stem cells is one of the most potent anti aging protocols that you can engage in. Nad stands for. I'll nicotinamide Adenine dinucleotide is what that is. And I can tell you about that in a second after I. I'll, I'll just briefly tell you about the cyclical ketogenic diet. Basically, it's all plants, all fats, no carbs or very low carbs the entire day, and then in the evening, and this is where the beauty of that scenario I talked about earlier fits in because you've done your your hard afternoon or early evening workout, so your glute four transporters are very upregulated.

Speaker 2:          01:31:09       You're very insulin sensitive in any carbohydrates that you do eat are far more likely to be shuttled into muscle or liver glycogen rather than hanging around the bloodstream causing inflammation, or rather than being shuttled to the liver and converted into triglycerides, you're basically using the carbohydrates that you do eat at the end of the day to sock away energy for the next day. It's hard. Glycolytic demanding workout, right? And so basically you're, you're teaching your body how to be a fat burning machine all day long. You're restricting any amount of glycemic variability all day long, assuming you're not doing the carnivorous diet because high amounts of meat, it's gluconeogenic. It can spike blood glucose, but you're essentially doing lots of plants, modern amount of fats and some amount of protein but, but not a crazy amount of protein all day long. And then with dinner, you know, we'll do just to make sourdough bread and while the sweet potato fries and my,

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       you know, my kids will make rice cakes, you know, we're dark chocolate, red wine, any of that stuff is all in the evenings, so that refills your glycogen stores for anything explosive and demanding and then you just rinse, wash and repeat the next day. So that's a cyclic ketogenic diet. Now this is cyclic one individual 24 hour session, but are you experiencing states of Ketosis during the day? Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I, so I have a device called a level in my office, L E v e l and it's a breath ketone device. It's just quicker and more convenient than a blood stick. It's also long term it, it, it's a good proxy. It's a good approximation. Lev, Lev l there's another one called the ketone x and you can get just like a, you know, a ketone monitor, a blood ketone monitor. Uh, but if people don't want to do a blood prick everyday, I type, I don't have the band aids on the fingers when I'm trying to write things on my lap.

Speaker 1:          01:32:53       It's just, it's easier for me to just breathe into a tube when I walk into my office. I'm easily that's exact track and adjust. So weird how this has become such a massive part of culture these days is measuring your ketones. Just constantly hear people talking about and it's so fatty fad now, you know? Yeah, I get it. It was funny that he, uh, anyway, I mean it, I just said it and I had to explain what I was saying because it sounded weird to me anyways though. The, uh, the cyclic ketogenic diet allows you to be back in the state of Ketosis by that morning easily. And then you just basically maintained that all day long. Then you refuel and carbohydrates at the end of the day. Uh, and then there was another question that you asked about nad that's something completely different but that, but that's the cyclical ketogenic diet works.

Speaker 1:          01:33:44       So your body having those carbohydrates at night knocks you out of Ketosis, right when you're, when you're eating the bread and your blood glucose will rise, you're not going to be shuttling a lot of Acetol Coa, which is the precursor to ketones and ketone generation and then you're going through a 16 hour fasting, but then you have a 12 to 16 hour fast and he said, I couldn't get up. You do the fasted morning aerobic workout, a cold shower, a little bit of coffee or green tea and it's a perfect scenario. PTOSIS works perfectly. I'm telling you, you, you start your day off like that and then you end your day with the carbohydrates as a hard afternoon workout. That easy morning workout and it like for, for metabolism, for body composition, uh, for, for maintaining fitness, for teaching yourself how to be a fat burning machine will still refilling the body of carbohydrates stores. It's a beautiful scenario. Also. I just think there's some, there's some benefit in enjoying what you eat to not constantly worrying about your glucose levels and ketones and all that stuff. I mean, I, I don't think there's anything wrong with having a little bread or a pasta or something like this. There's nothing wrong with it and that, I mean, it's also my beef with, uh, with the carnivore diet is, you know, I like sweet potato fries and I like, you know, I like cauliflower

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       rice and I like, you know, all sorts of different plants and vegetables. Now this, um, this nad you can get these injections or ivs now and it is something that enhances your own stem cell proliferation, but it is one of the most potent anti aging molecules you can put into your body in terms of decreasing the rate at which your telomeres shorten. So you've probably heard a lot of these, sir, two enriched foods like blueberries and Cacao and chocolate and resveratrol and a lot of them work. But the most powerful of any of these as nad nad to Nadh ratio is highly reflective of your telomere health. And these are the most horribly painful and uncomfortable injections or ivs you would ever get in your life. You can, you can do it orally. There's a, there's a capsule, there's companies like elise, a nitrogen that sell nr.

Speaker 2:          01:35:51       Take that stuff. Nicotinamide, nicotinamide riboside. It's a precursor to Nad, but it doesn't hold a candle to just mainlining it into your bloodstream. And how do you get it? We're going to do. So one way to do it is in a medical clinic, you can get a six to eight hour ivy bringing a laptop and you work away. And some people do this on a monthly basis, just six to eight hours of. It's a long drip. Um, you know, they have some of the guys down at on it, do it, and they'll have a nurse come in and push a little bit more quickly. That's like an hour long. Uh, Ivy has it. Just do it short like that. It's way more uncomfortable. The shore you get, the more uncomfortable it gets because you're pushing this stuff into your bloodstream more quickly. And it feels like your whole body is on fire.

Speaker 2:          01:36:34       I mean, you have to box breath and close your eyes and meditate. Painful. It's, it's like if you ever done dmt DMT, but you're on fire and getting punched in the gut at the same time and you feel like your heart's going to explode and then you finish and you feel like superman. You feel like you have more energy on less sleep. Your workouts are better. I mean, it's one of the, it's like fish oil where when you take a bunch of fish oil, you just kind of keep your fingers crossed that it's working. It's not like you can feel fish oil and you want to go destroy the world. Um, it's even better than black ant extract. So there's, you can get it to you. So I get it shipped to my house and I do a self administered push ivy. I do the same thing with Myers cocktails.

Speaker 2:          01:37:18       So I just shove a butterfly needle into my vein and then I push this nad and very, very slowly. And you can even chase it with a myers cocktail which enhances the effectiveness of it. Meaning you can do like a, an Nid. And this is a common protocol and lot of anti aging clinics are a lot of, you know, like a alternative health clinics as you do the Nad injection and you follow it up with a myers cocktail and you feel like superman admires, that's just vitamins, vitamin infusion, it's ivy infusion of vitamin B and sometimes they'll nootropics and they're like lithium and stuff like that. It's too much to remember, man. Oh. But it's. So you had a. I'm a complete idiot about anything except health and nutrition and fitness. That's how like, I don't know, I don't watch TV and, and uh, I don't follow politics or anything like that.

Speaker 2:          01:38:03       I just studied. Keep the poison out. Yes, exactly. It's like Sherlock Holmes and Watson tells us him him his name and he says I'm going to work hard to forget that because he doesn't want anything cluttering up his head at all. Right. Aside from his sleuthing. So is there an nad place in la where I could go and do this? Yes, there I was speaking with somebody yesterday about this and he asked me if I could find a clinic and I found one in Beverly Hills and uh, it's probably an one of the long ivy, so you'll want to wait till we have some computer work to do and you can sit on your laptop and just kind of get stuff done six to eight hours or you can just listen to Paul, you can, you can push it in and about 15 to 20 minutes and you can have a nurse practitioner do this.

Speaker 2:          01:38:46       And then there are some clinics that will do, it's called a push ivy and nad push ivy. So beneficial. Just more painful. I'm doing this once a week now and it's painful 10 to 20 minutes of my entire week, but you feel amazing. And I'm, I'm testing my telomere length with this company called Tello years. They say there's another one, I forget the name of the other company that tests your telomere length. There's only a couple out there. So it tests the rate at which your telomeres are shortening. And the two things that have had the most profound effect on my results from that test have been the stem cell injections intravenously and the Nad injections, my biological age right now, which started off at an age of 37 when I was 34 and then decreased to 35 when I tested again at 36 years old. I just tested it 37 years old and my biological age is 20 in terms of the rate at which my telomeres are shortening.

Speaker 2:          01:39:41       And the only two things that have changed have been the stem cell injections and the Nad injections. So me and biological age, you can reverse your biological age. Now there is some side effects. No, like, so the telomere test is a test of your white blood cell telomere length, which is not reflective of every cell in your body. Right? So, so technically, uh, it's, it's not like a, it's not an ironclad test with a ton of research behind it, but it's an approximate corollary to your biological age. It's the best we have right now to be able to test telomere length. But I'm not going to pretend like it's a, it's a, it's a gold standard test and I'm not aware of a gold standard test for telomere length, but I can tell you that I feel amazing and that telomere length is shortening. And those Nad injections just make you feel like superman.

Speaker 2:          01:40:29       So do you think it's a combination of the things or do we, would you attribute it more to the Nad is the problem with this shit? I do, Dude. He's just so many different things. Yeah. And there's. And there's stuff you can do to enhance your own endogenous stem cell production. We were talking about meat and I told you about that study with the. We were talking about the carnosine and the blueberry extract. That's one of chlorella is another colostrum is fantastic for that, for endogenous stem cell health. Coffee Berry fruit extract. That's another really fascinating one. And you can buy that on Amazon as a powder. And I put a lot of this stuff in my morning smoothie now. So when I wake up, you know, I've got Chlorella, I've got Dha, I've got this, uh, this stuff called Howdy Arco Bark Tea, which also enhances your own nad production, a colostrum, bone broth, vitamin C to enhance the bone broth uptake.

Speaker 2:          01:41:18       So you can kind of make yourself a little, a little cocktail of ingredients that you just take in the morning without necessarily spending, you know, 8,000 bucks on a stem cell and extraction and injections. Have you thought about like having some sort of an online thing where people could subscribe to a protocol and you would, you know, what I thought about doing was just making like a, like a, a supplement or something like that where you can take all this stuff and just combine it into a shake or into some kind of a supplement. So I'm just going to buy out or something. And I mean some, some people who don't understand the supplement industry or formulation to, well, why don't you just put all this stuff in a capsule, but I mean, you, one compound can decrease the absorbability of the other compound or you know, one compound will create an aesthetic or an alkaline scenario in which the other one doesn't work well.

Speaker 2:          01:42:03       So it would require a lot of testing. But ultimately, you know, at this point I just blend it all in a blender and kind of keep my fingers crossed and dump it all into my big biggest mug. And it seems like, you know, someone like you who knows so much about this stuff, it would be a great resource if people could subscribe to something and you guys could put together some sort of a protocol for people that would fall. They could follow it on a daily basis and you know, you're creating more work for me.

Speaker 2:          01:42:31       Uh, yeah, but, but it would, the problem is genetic variability, right? Like this whole high fat diet. And, uh, you know, I saw yesterday that you tweeted out a, uh, you know, my friend Nina Teicholz is, you know, data, you know, encouraging the high saturated fat intake and I love her and I love her approach and I love the idea that she is getting a lot of people, you know, via the lobbying to focus less on grains and high carb diet, which I think is helpful for a lot of people. But at the same time there are, there are genes are like the PPA, our one alpha gene, which would cause a little bit of an inflammatory response to high intake of fats or to a lot of saturated fats without a lot of poly or mono unsaturated fats there. I think the last time that we talk, we talked about familial hypercholesterolemia, right?

Speaker 2:          01:43:24       Where some people, if they shift to a Kenogenic or a high fat diet, it screws them from a metabolic standpoint because they get not only high cholesterol but you know, high particle count and, and oxidation of that cholesterol. Um, there's, there's, uh, there's ways around that, you know, for example, like a catava and diet would be what you'd consume if you were, if you were eating or if you had this familial hypercholesterolemia where he'd eat a lot of tubers and fish and coconut meat and wild plants and that's technically like a 70 to 80 percent carbohydrate based diet. Now with a lot of grains, you know, now with a lot of junk food. But that would be a diet more appropriate for someone with that issue. Um, someone with a PPA, our Jane issue, they'd want to eat less of the coconut oil and the butter and the cheeses and more of like the Avocados and the extra virgin olive oil and more of the Mediterranean diet approach.

Speaker 2:          01:44:16       You know, I mentioned earlier that the, the fact that coconut oil and a lot of these saturated fats and a lot of people are inflammatory, so they would want to eat a lot of, a lot of antioxidants and flavonols and polyphenol rich, small, non sugary berries and dark leafy Greens. And so again, you could have a subscription based service that teaches people a lot of these things, but then once again, you got to have either artificial intelligence that screening each person to look at what they actually need or you've got a real person talking to each person looking at their labs and saying, okay, this is the one that would work well for you. Rather than just saying, okay, this, this has been smoothie, everybody should be drinking this. Right? Yeah. I went to this one thing once where they monitored my blood and I abandoned it immediately because they told me I shouldn't have avocados.

Speaker 2:          01:45:01       I'm like, what are you talking about? Igg Food Allergy tests. And the problem is that you produce a lot of these immunoglobulins to foods that you eat a lot, so people will be of eggs and they do this test and they walk out depressed with their tail between their legs because they can't have avocados and eggs anymore. And it's because they were eating a shit ton of Avocados and eggs. The DM, right? Yeah. There's one called the Cyrex food allergy panel. It's a little more. You don't get this huge laundry list of foods that give you false positives. It's a pretty accurate test that I use. Knew it was nonsense. It was like, I feel great. I eat Avocados all the time. This can be anything other than nonsense. Yeah, well, it's not nonsense. I mean they should immunoglobulin reaction to Avocados and there's no bodies in the streets.

Speaker 2:          01:45:44       No evidence that that's going to actually are you. That's the problem. It's just you would have to go on some sort of a very neutral diet for a long period of time. Get your body's baseline established exactly at your blood work, done whatever rice for a month and then get it taken proteins at all and even then, what would that do? Probably do like a wash out like a five day fast and that's that. That new valter, Longo longevity diet is you do, I think it's five over the know once a quarter, five day fast, right? To clean you out to get all the benefits of cellular autophagy and with that particular diet. I was talking before about how long term calorie restriction is bad for you, you know, and this whole idea of intermittent fasting with caloric restriction creates hormone deficits and associated with gallstones and all sorts of nasty things happen to your body when you don't give it enough calories.

Speaker 2:          01:46:37       What about long term? Like you know when people go into those five day fast like Dom D'agostino, valter, Longo, his approach is you do a five day fast just a few times a year and I think in in active individuals, athletes, he only recommends like two or three times a year Max that you do this five day fast and you put it in an off season or recovery phase or some period of time where you're not training heavily and that scenario would allow you to get a lot of the cellular autophagy and the cleanup benefits and theoretically you could do that, right? And then go get your food allergy tests and see what kind of proteins are floating around your brain and you're doing a 24 hour fast. How often? What works for me because I don't do well, not even for five days, I'm too active. Like I just have too much shit going on.

Speaker 2:          01:47:17       Oh, like there aren't many times during the year when I could point out a five day slot in my schedule where I'm not hunting or competing or working out or doing something that requires me to need calories or outside. I'm just going to. I'm already skinny, like I can't go for a long time without eating and my metabolism is sky high. So what I do is a 12 to 16 hour fast every day. Not a calorically restricted fast, but just 12 to 16 hours without eating every single day. On the lower activity days I'd taken less protein and restricted meat. That's one of the days where I'm not beating up my body too much and like a Wednesday and a Sunday, which are more recovery days. Those were the days when I do, you know, fricken. I close myself love days or like I do clay masks and coffee enemas and infrared therapy like.

Speaker 2:          01:48:01       So I'm still. So for, for, for upregulating, your own glutathione production, your biopsy, you feel clean as a whistle plus it's the best way to get coffee up your, but there's no other way that you do. You do get a lot of caffeine absorption to know. But I'm, I'm seriously, if you've never done something like that and experienced what it feels like to just be completely cleaned out, it's a pretty good feeling towards the duty of the coffee enema not only cleans out your colon, but it causes your liver and your gallbladder, gallbladder specifically to increase bile production. It upregulate your glutathione production, your indulgence, Buddha, fire and production. And so you're increasing your production of antioxidants. And it also causes Paris dialysis while she just moved stuff through. That's kind of moving slowly. So once a week, Wednesday mornings I get up, uh, my, my wife makes coffee every morning and have her make an extra pot as leave that out on the counter until it gets to room temperature.

Speaker 2:          01:48:55       And normally when I'm drinking my coffee, I'm going through all my morning research and articles and everything down in my. I have a standing desk in the basement, but instead I go in, I, I lay on my right side, on the bathroom floor and I keep coughing in there for about 20 minutes while I'm working and then I get up and you just let it all out and you lay on your coffee and your. But I get a stainless steel animal bucket, so plastics, so you're not injecting classics up your butt and then you had. It's about a quarter, so have coffee in the back side with this tube. It's a lot of coffee, Jesus. And then you lay on your right side for 20 minutes and then you get up and you let it all out and, and of course I have the squatty potty so it comes up more easily.

Speaker 2:          01:49:39       Of course, you know of that kink in your photos and everything comes out and you just, you walk away just like whistling with a big smile on your face. That's squatty potty is legit. I feel wonderful. It's, it probably works really should be getting into a hole in the ground when I don't have one. I perch my best dumps. So when I'm hunting or camping or on the toilet, you hold onto a tree and you kinda do it like a dog person and it's perfect. So. So on those days that I'm doing coffee enemas or sauna or any weird woo woo, things that don't involve workouts, I do protein restriction because I'm not beating up my body that much. Coffee Enema doesn't cause a lot of east centric muscle tissue damage unless you've done something horribly wrong. So I basically have those days as my lower protein days and then once a week, and this would be, unless I'm traveling because it's harder to doing travel.

Speaker 2:          01:50:25       I do a 24 hour fast Saturday at dinner, you stop eating, sleep all night. All he gotta do is skip breakfast on Sunday and skip lunch on Sunday and then have dinner on Sunday night and that's pretty easy to do. And so I get the benefits of the longer fast. Right? Because a lot of those cellular autophagy and endogenous stem cell production benefits don't kick in until you're about 16 hours in. Right? So I get that benefit once a week even though for me really it comes out to about twice a month that I'm actually at home because I travel so much, doing that full 24 hour fast and I do a lot of work that day. I play with my kids, I just feel things in throughout that day to keep my appetite satiated. And sometimes they'll do some of those new ketone esters and sometimes we'll do some amino acids or you know, a cup of bone broth doesn't count as breaking your fast kind of sword of cheating.

Speaker 2:          01:51:11       But it's, it's, it's like it's a speed bump for a skinny, you know, high metabolism guy like me to have like a cup of 40 calorie bone broth in the middle of the day. The bone broth fast. The ketone esters also break your fast. They're a caloric. Yeah. I'm technically, you know, from, from just a pure, you know, very simple physiology standpoint. Your body would need to utilize those ketones for energy before it would, you know, turn some of your own Acetol Coa, a derived from your fat into extra ketones. But I just liked the way I feel on fasting using these, these especially like the newer ketone esters in the case on why aren't you supposed to take them with glucose? No, no, no. You are going to get a huge performance advantage by taking them with glucose, but that's also, uh, it, it's, it's an ancestrally inappropriate state for the human body to have simultaneously elevated levels of blood glucose and elevated levels of blood ketones because traditionally we'd have elevated our blood ketones through fasting and while I'm okay with elevating blood key tones via a non ancestral roots, such as the consumption of these ketone esters designed by the US Department of Defense for soldiers in battle, they have to go two or three days without eating or for Tour de France riders have been using them for awhile.

Speaker 2:          01:52:31       The idea of consuming glucose along with those ketones and spiking blood glucose, which can have a little bit of an inflammatory oxidative effect, is not something I would do unless I were like in a race or in a really hard demanding workout. That's where something like that you can, you can use like rocket fuel and that's actually a very good mix, some kind of like a fruit dose, Maltodextrin blend, which the gatorade sports science institute has shown allows you to get a really high absorption of carbohydrates rather than, you know, just Maltodextrin or just glucose or just fruit dose. Then you add in Ketone esters on top of that and then to stave off what's called central nervous system fatigue, the crossing of trip to fan into the brain, which kind of makes you feel, you know, Turkey dinner, sleepy effect during exercise. You throw essential amino acids into that, so you've got amino acids, ketones and glucose, and that mix is just pure rocket fuel.

Speaker 2:          01:53:24       Yeah. You talked about that last time you said it was like being on steroids that having glucose in your system with ketones. It's just fucking crazy. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's pretty amazing. Now when you go on these fast, if you drink coffee, does coffee break your fast coffee or the consumption of anything from a circadian biology, right? Twenty four hour circadian rhythm. You've, you've got multiple Circadian Rhythm Qs, one is movement, so when you travel and you're jet lagged, movement helps you normalize your biological clock. Another is light, right, so exposure to high amounts of morning sunlight or using one of these new fangled hacking devices like the, like the light or the in Ir Light, that's another circadian q eating or really the consumption of anything. Supplements, coffee, tea, etc. That's also a circadian q. There's a researcher dr satchin panda, who's got some really good research on circadian rhythmicity and what he says is that the consumption of anything can disrupt circadian biology.

Speaker 2:          01:54:28       If you're fasting for the purposes of regulating your circadian rhythms, maybe you've got insomnia, poor sleep patterns, inflammation due to lack of sleep or lack of the glymphatic drainage and consolidation of memory and everything that occurs during deep sleep. Your sleep is more or less fucked up, right? Like that would be a situation in which you just wouldn't want to eat anything during a fast. But if you're fastest for the purposes of, let's say like fat loss or even some of you know, like the endogenous stem cell production benefits of fasting and a caloric cup of coffee is not going to cause any issues. And furthermore, if you're concerned about like the cholesterol is in the coffee, use the paper filter because you're going to filter out most of the cholesterol as well versus like a french press or you know, or steel filter. Yeah. What about water? Water I think is completely allowed. Now there are some people who do dry fasting, a that will be popular for people who have like candida or yeast or fungi. They would claim that a moist environment would allow the bacteria to flourish. And so some of those people will do dry fasting. I know a guy who does dry fasting with autologous urine therapy where he does dry fast in the morning, he drinks his urine and. And that's some old ayurvedic cleanse techniQue that I, I don't personally, we were trying. I did

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       Try it. It, I try to do it. Yeah. It doesn't make sense. It's not sort of the best. Yeah, actually the temperature got to me more than the taste, just like the warm hotness, just it felt from the tactile to alive. Yeah, it was just, it was. So ultimately the coffee is not an issue unless you're putting a bunch of stuff in it. Right. and then even though it is admittedly noninsulin agentic and it's actually quite a kick in the pants, as you know, you know when you blend fats with coffee, you get the cough, a stall on the hallway, all they cross the blood brain barrier, they amp you up psychologically. You're also getting. Your body has to burn those calories before it burns a lot of its own calories. So that's not something you would do. You would do well on a facet.

Speaker 1:          01:56:26       Stayed bent. I to wrap this up, you, uh, you're always a minD. Fuck dude. Every time you come in here I have to pauSe after the podcast and try to like capture little bits of information. Now. That's pretty much my main takeaway from the Past couple of hours as I want. I want to freaking steak, tell people how they can get to your website. Tell people how they can watch your videos. Go read this article. I just. It's. It's good. Ben greenfield fitness.com, or just google. Ben greenfield and social media has ben greenfield. You just look, there's not a lot of us. Benjamin greenfields out there and find the benjamin greenfield. You're bad, motherfucker. Appreciate man. Thanks for coming in. As was officer,

Speaker 3:          01:57:07       everybody.
