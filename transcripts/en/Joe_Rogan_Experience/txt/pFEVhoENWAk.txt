That's not what they really sound like when they're rolling around and magical. But it is, it's five f five HTP and the whole trip to fan and it's got sort of a time release quality to it because five HTP is what turns into Serotonin and which what your body uses to make serotonin and l tryptofan. It's what your body converts in the five HTP. So there's like a time release aspect of new mood and you take them at night. Uh, you can take them during the day too.

It was really awkward. It's really awkward. The dream about her sexually. Yeah. That'd be funny. If she wasn't a porn star. That'd be hilarious if she wasn't in like how many gang bang films this shit done? They're like violent gang bang one. So when you like her, she's a nice person. Like, oh, I enjoy being around her. It wasn't like a sex dream like that. It was like, it was like a romantic dream that became sexual and it was very awkward.

Yeah, we're you, we're trying to sell shit as cheap as possible. The, the, the idea behind on it is to sell you guys the best process.

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       Yeah. The, the actual price. The MSRP is six 59 and we sell them for four 54. Wow. That's go the best possible shit or the cheapest we can sell it.

He was awesome. He was a really cool and interesting like I was smart as fuck. It scared the shit out of me. I've been thinking about it. It was like, you know when you see a movie and sometimes you're like, God, that was good. Maybe. Then there's other movies you see and you think about it for like the rest of the night. You wouldn't talk about it while you're eating. You know? It's kind of like that guy. Like I, I'm, I want to listen to it again and try to dissect what that guy was saying. Yeah. Well let's talk about that later. Let's get through this fucking rancid commercial.

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       We're stuck in. Go buy some shit. Go to desk squad. Dot TV and buy some shit. The November 11 tickets are sold out though. You fuck heads. You missed out.

Speaker 1:          00:06:50       don't think they ha ha. I think you have to take their calendar and then you have to corresponded to a, our, our, you know, whatever it's called. The green. What does the, what does Arconic calendar called? What is the technical term but Gorian Gregorian. Yeah. So I don't think, I don't think we should talk about that in the middle of commodity. So hire at dash primate Dotcom t shirts are back in stock. So go to death squad. Dot. TV. Brian's t shirts are available and hired primate is all monkeys and mushrooms and their software. Um, I'm a silly man. All right ladies and men, this podcast, we're going to try to keep it as, as light on the gloom and doom as possible because the subject matter is absolutely fucking hideous. It's not tangible, right? It's crap. Now, this wasn't a, this isn't a when thanks though for, sorry. Weeks of 10. One.

Speaker 2:          00:07:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:43       Experience. First of all, thank you guys for enduring those commercials. This is the least professional piece of broadcast and you'll ever be a part of. We're trying to be as minimalized and is, uh, easily dismissed as we can. So we just, it was just going to do bad stuff from here on out. Yeah. Have signed to lay low. There's too much bad information out there. The more I read about what's going on, the more you read about the government anymore. He read about corruption and, and, and, and censorship and what, what's really going on behind the scenes. It's fucking depressing. Do you guys feel that? Who I'm talking to is Abby Martin. David Seaman. And I'm sorry, David's kind of your, what is the exact term is online campaign campaign manager, which named Buddy Dell. Cameron. Tell Cameron, Dale Dale Dale down pack like Dell, like the computer. Right. Do you ever use, do you use Dell Dell products? We feel silly. Uh, if I was using like a rogue and laptop, but going to that bitch, same name. So I would feel weird about that. Doesn't bother you. No.

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       Good for you man. I mean, I'm not sure it's short for Cordell. Oh, Cordell. Oh, okay. Okay. But I'm a junior and that's just too confusing sometimes for my, your father talk with a southern accent police. I guess that'd be awesome if he's Cordell and Cordell for Dale Dale junior come over here, touchy you about life. Um, you guys are all very young and you're all very idealistic. You're all very, uh, uh, you're, you're, you're the new breed of journalists and we're, we're seeing this because of what's going on because there's so much censorship and because CNN and Fox News and they've gotten to be what you got to think of as untrustworthy sources in for the simple fact that they don't concentrate on everything. There's a lot of shit. It's really important that they don't cover. But meanwhile they'll find the time to cover ridiculous shit.

Speaker 3:          00:09:50       They'll find the time to, to cover some nonsense celebrity Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Story. They'll find that time, they'll fit it in, but they won't find the time to discuss the NDA. They won't find the time to discuss these buildings that they're making in Utah where they're going to store everybody's information that they need to be discussing this. That's what journalism is supposed to be for. Everyone knows this now and because of you guys, because of this new breed of young kids who grew up with the Internet, he grew up with this massive access to information and this model that they've got in place for how shit runs is whack. And it's not gonna work. It's not going to work. It's like almost like a religious model. It's like you have to believe in it as a religion and you have to trust the government and full faith for it to work at all.

Speaker 3:          00:10:41       And the only way they're, they're, they're actually getting people to go along with that is by connecting it to religion that connected to, to the really simple minded folks, that whole God and government thing. And you know, God's on our side. And it really does become sort of a religious, a variable. It becomes like the reason why it's working. It's because we've got this weird wacky thing in us. We're willing to believe shit that doesn't make any sense. And there's a lot of you guys that are coming up that aren't doing that. You're, you're, you're standing up and you're saying this is, the information that you're getting is not exactly what's happening.

Speaker 4:          00:11:16       And they're lying through omission also. Yes. It's not so much that they're running stories saying don't worry about Nda. It's that they're not covering it at all. Yeah. And I think that's something else is more important. So instead it's, let's talk about Mitt Romney's tax returns from the 90s and let's not focus on something that is happening right now.

Speaker 3:          00:11:33       How did that happen? How did they do or they just bought and paid for? I mean, what is it?

Speaker 4:          00:11:37       Some of them, I think that's, yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's not for truth telling. I mean, they can legally lie. So it's just a profit making industry. They're not, they're not supposed to tell you the fucking news. I mean, they sell shit to you. They sell fear and they sell sensationalism. That's what sells. There's huge entertainment

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       value to it. And that's why they have somebody watching it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:55       When did the sellout begin?

Speaker 6:          00:11:59       Yeah, during the deregulation era when we had, you know, it went from like 60 companies to now five corporations control everything that you see and read in the main stream and general electric. I mean, the biggest fucking weapons' contractor owns MSNBC, NBC. So

Speaker 5:          00:12:15       ads running during news programs itself. Like, I mean, it, it takes away from like, the, the viewers aren't really the customers anymore. The ad agencies are, and the viewers were, we're more of, um, you're the part of like a product because that's their selling are, you know, the fact that we're reviewing too.

Speaker 1:          00:12:33       So you think, I mean, well that would be actually a good way to allocate government funds, right? Wouldn't it be to have like an independent news source that was funded completely and totally by tax dollars and had nothing to do with any commercials whatsoever? Is that what it actually is for Russia? That's what you work for. The Russian times is our t right? Russia today. Rush it to them. I'm sorry. Do they, um, are they accurate with stuff that goes on in rush

Speaker 6:          00:13:02       that is questionable? Uh, they, you know, it's like the BBC in London. Um, so you're not going to cover Putin, obviously, like very unfavorable, you're probably not going to call it the elections as being stolen or whatnot. But in terms of rt America, which is where I work, we just focused wholeheartedly on American foreign policy and domestic policy. So that's really where my head's at. I mean we don't see Russia going around and colonizing the rest of the world. So I'm kind of picking my battles here and working for a,

Speaker 1:          00:13:29       they still, they still keep a gangster in Russia. They're, yeah, they're keeping it as gangster as any like real evolve civilization can, I mean, it's really good, again, because of the Internet, because of this access to information that we have now and we're kind of really seeing the true shape of these things. Whereas before it was all hidden behind. You know, nobody, nobody had access to information. Nobody knew about who, never who. I mean, how many people actually went through the Warren Commission report and followed up on all the inconsistencies. How many people have actually like read a bill? How many people have actually, it's, it's, it's too confusing for people on that

Speaker 5:          00:14:08       broadcasters that are actually, you're going to read it and relay the information accurately.

Speaker 1:          00:14:12       Exactly. So what should it be? Should it be that the news is completely noncommercial? Should it be that the news is state funded? So because, but you can't tell these fuckheads where to spend money. That's the most annoying thing about giving out taxes. Some of the networks don't appear to be the networks that are supposedly operating for profit or making decisions that are against their own commercial interests to instead promote propaganda, which is worrying. You look at like, so NDA would have been a massive story with a lot of viewers and a lot of hits on the online side. Right. And why wasn't that covered? You know, Wiki leaks is a massive story in every possible way. So something's happening behind the scenes that is not purely driven by profit. It's by,

Speaker 4:          00:14:51       uh, um, what's the word, by ideology. You know, somebody who's being told or somebody believes that this should not be shown to the public.

Speaker 6:          00:14:59       Yeah. That's where it gets really scary is when it surpasses the, the a moneymaking like the paypal thing when they tried to block funds to Bradley Manning and you're like, you're working against your interest to make money and to try to fucking promote some sort of government and make money off of that green is easier to understand.

Speaker 3:          00:15:15       You know what you're talking about. Like, yeah, it's, it's, it's really confusing. Like when you see these things like the end date. For folks who don't know, let's just give a brief overview of what the NDA actually means to people just so they know. We know why. Well, they know, rather while we're upset, why don't you just explain it in that show?

Speaker 4:          00:15:36       Uh, the NDA is normally passed every year. It's our defense appropriations bill. So, uh, pays for the troops, salaries and all of our spending overseas and various military things. Uh, in this last year's bill in 2011, they snuck in a provision section 10 21, which appears to allow for the imprisonment without trial of American citizens on suspicion alone. Uh, and that's what has caused all the uproar. Why was this thing snuck into something that they pretty much need to pass? Why did Obama claim that he wanted to veto it? And then he withdrew his veto, threatened sign it into law at like 11:30 PM on New Year's Eve when nobody was paying attention. And then he went to stay there. I said, it was like the sneakiest move I've ever seen in my lifetime from a president, this single sneakiest move. And then he issues a signing statement saying, I did it, I have resin, I had reservations about it, but I'm not gonna use it.

Speaker 4:          00:16:26       And you're like, okay, maybe he gets it. Maybe you just had to sign it for some reason that we don't know about a, and then his lawyer's in court have tried incredibly ferociously to hang on to this power. We've seen two rounds of that now and it's gotten very serious. I think the next stop, uh, I mean it already went through a three judge panel and the appeals court and they ruled in his favor. So we're getting pretty close to the Supreme Court at this point. I think they have to see another, there's another round of something that the appeals court can go through, but it's scary that Obama claims he doesn't want this. And yet his lawyers are working very diligently to make sure that he has it.

Speaker 3:          00:17:00       It appears to me that either they know something that we don't know or there is a systematic sort of a psychosis involved in governing people and when you're in a position where you have the power to tell people what to do, it does not seem like a natural position and it seems like this us versus them mentality that can come come about it. It gets to a point where they're willing to sacrifice the lives of people that are supposed to be on their team. They're willing to do that in order to push their agenda. When you hear about stuff like that and you hear about like the false flag events and the planned false flag of act, a false flag event that they were going to do an ran about operation Northwoods in the 60s yeah, that's well documented, well documented that they were going to blow up a drone airliner and it on Cuba.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       They were going to arm chub and friendly's and have them attack Guantanamo Bay and they were going to blame all this shit on Cuba so we could go to war with Cuba. There were just going to kill people. They're going to kill Americans. They were going to kill soldiers. They're going to attack basis. You know? I mean, they're easily could have been in completely innocent Americans that have died because these guys wanted an excuse to get into war. Well, why the fuck would anybody want to do that? What is that? What is it where you would you be a person who was in government? You're supposed to be the leader of these people, but you're doing something that's completely contrary to the wants and needs of any of the people. I think leadership has become kind of cannibalistic where they're like, okay, we need to keep you safe, but in order to do that, you have to strip you of your rights. You're destroying the things that the terrorist supposedly hate us for. You know, you're taking away our core freedoms are turning us into a Middle Eastern regime. Yeah, but they're consciously doing it. They're not. They don't believe that she is doing this. Who is the person? Who is the group? What is, is it follow? The money is at the top of the food truck

Speaker 6:          00:18:48       machine and incorporations control the the body elect, not not just any corporation, it's defense contractors, defense contractors, Monsanto. There's a few a keynote, but I didn't see insatiable urge for more control. I mean when you have the technology at your fingertips and it's just exponentially growing, you just want it. The insatiable urge to control that to, you know, if there's facial recognition technology, you want to seize that. You want to fucking tap into all that shit and just have the grid just because you can. I think anything

Speaker 1:          00:19:16       become, you can rationalize anything you know for them as long as it's like supporting the business interests of the United States as opposed to like anything else. Like I think that there one of them, this is not a sickness and then it could be so pervasive that it could be thousands of people. It could be where people working together along with people that signed up for the military to supposedly protect, you know, this country. They could be involved in this, this nonsense. People are hopped up on episodes of homeland and then actually believe they believe their own internal memos that people like me, journalists and independent politicians who don't side with one party and people who are like fucking college students who have backpacks and little cameras to record stuff, that those people are potential terrorists. It's absolutely insane. You start believing their own lie. Yeah. I mean it's just nobody challenged it. Nobody is saying no, that's bullshit. So over time people go, maybe this is the way it is. Maybe, maybe these people are terrorists. They are undermining our system, right? Maybe, maybe journalists are terrorists who, so why isn't this discussion ever going mainstream? Why? Why has this discussion completely avoided? But even like unlike Bill Maher show, they don't talk about this. Like, I mean, what we're trying to do is turn the mainstream and away from the TV and bring it over to us.

Speaker 6:          00:20:33       Yeah. But even, I mean, yeah, Bill Maher's broke is the line. A lot of tickets.

Speaker 1:          00:20:38       I mean, you've got to find new media has bill Maher's and brought this up?

Speaker 6:          00:20:43       No, Bill Maher fucking pulled out his giant checkbook. Gave $1 million to Obama's fucking Super Pac Dune though Mars totally toeing the line. I mean it's sad, you know, you can fall in line with so much of what he says and at the end of the day he's just like, and that's why you need to donate money to Obama. And you're like, what?

Speaker 3:          00:21:01       Yeah, I don't get it. I mean maybe it's to get guests on. Maybe if it doesn't play the game, you can't run a show the way he wants to run a show.

Speaker 5:          00:21:08       I think it's a status symbol. I think so. I think people donate large amounts of money to political campaigns just so that people know that they did. Yeah, you're right. Well, no, not everyone, but I think a lot of people do that. It's like philanthropy for like people like charities, hunty philanthropists, philanthropies, braggy and shit about their philanthropy. Yeah, it's the same. Same thing to me. I think,

Speaker 6:          00:21:31       well, here's the reason that the dialogue is not inserted in the mainstream because the problem with the media other than of course the fact that it's controlled by corporations and that it's partisan. So it's divide and conquer. I mean they bring up these really divisive issues that no one can agree on in a country of 380 million people just to keep us fighting when really we can all agree on the huge issues that we don't want to fucking, you know, invade the entire planet and spend, you know, just waste millions and trillions of dollars by killing people. I mean I think we can all agree on those things, but they like to keep us a, you know, fighting with each other. And so you have these networks like MSNBC, Fox News, CNN, they're all partisan and they all push these narratives that don't broaden up the scope to undermine the actual rhetoric of the establishment line, which is really, you know, they tow that line to keep people in line and that's the problem. They pull abortion out of the pocket cause that's the way it's not going to be resolved next month or next year. It's always going to be something we're 47 or 48% of the people believe this one thing and 47 or 48% of the people believe this one thing and then two or 3% don't really give a shit. Gay Rights and abortion, everything's going to be like that until the end of the time.

Speaker 3:          00:22:35       Yes. It will never make marriage legal federally ever. They won't because then they lose that thing to argue about. It's like they'll always figure out a way to make that a stupid issue that comes up.

Speaker 5:          00:22:47       Well that's what I was telling them last night. Like I think maybe a lot of conservative politicians don't really want abortion, um, to be illegal because it would take away like the one big polarizing issue that they have with their, with their bring brings the ground springs, the crowds like, yeah. I mean

Speaker 6:          00:23:01       did he wrote Dajani laid the Tennessee who is like pro life and then force his mistress to have an abortion. Pretty fucking funny. Sounds like a classy caught up on that shit. I'm like outlawed contraception, but he had put a bill through to fund like animal contraception. It's all this self loathing game.

Speaker 3:          00:23:18       Yeah, you've got to worry about anybody that really cares that other people were doing things that have no effect on them and you wrap it up in your religion and whatever you want to wrap it up. Then if you're going after people for what they enjoy doing, there's something wrong with you. It's just that simple. Right. Saw the bill of rights. Such an important thing. You have these rights doesn't really matter to me. The government thinks that it would make us safer to take them away. That's not what you can do. This is the safest time we've ever known. There's never been more safety. There's never been like a peace America. We could go even in this fucking terrible economy, like it's safer to live today than it has been to ever live ever on earth. You know? And we still act like the fucking sky is falling.

Speaker 3:          00:23:57       We're going to snatch away rights and build up military camps. Will you know what it is? Man? It's not even red scare. I mean, what it is is, uh, a business that's trying to stay in business and there's only one way to stay in business. You got to ramp up the fucking military action side. You want to make a lot of money and sell a lot of fucking tanks. I one ramp up the military action bringing home our number one export weapons. How the fuck can we still, you know, we have to sell that shit. We have to sell that shit. They're selling tanks were just sitting there collecting dust that we don't use. There's massive, massive amounts of money. We make iPods and Predator drones, we don't even mail make the iPods designed in California. Well in Brazil I was just in Brazil and apparently they make iPods and iPhones there as well. So if you bring one over, like if you're a Brazilian and you have, when they want to make sure that you didn't go and buy an American one and then come over to Brazil because that fucks with their economy because the Brazilian ones are like a little bit more expensive. So I guess they give you a hard time.

Speaker 4:          00:24:57       It's like this thing of the Supreme Court is looking at this fall, the first sale doctrine, uh, where uh, it could challenge your right to resell like your iPhone or your car or anything, anything that you've bought. You'd have to get permission from like Ford, can I resell this car to this third party now that I no longer wanted? What? Because uh, you should bring up the details of it. I'm going to mess up the details. It's really sick about that. Is it only really affects businesses and or like small businesses, it doesn't really affect like, I mean of course I could always walk next door and saw my car to my neighbor so it's not really going to affect me personally, but it's going to just like trash a bunch of Internet, it's going to destroy. There's Ebay would immediately go.

Speaker 3:          00:25:34       There's an issue with electric cars as well that people aren't taking any consideration. A lot of people think there's some how or another going to be free from Karma if they get an electric car. One of it, it takes a lot of oil to build and make an electric car. But two is electric cars run on lithium ion batteries and lithium ion batteries come from places like the Congo and a lot of times they're dug out of the ground by little kids and that's just a fucking fact. And you can use your laptop and your cell phone all day, but it's very likely that somewhere along the chain someone was abused. I mean literally down to like the most inhuman type thing you do. Like you turn someone into a slave, you turn someone in the working slave for you, you make them do that. Like that.

Speaker 3:          00:26:15       The breakdown of the highest expression of technology we have available. If you follow its path at the end of it, as a kid in Africa digging in the ground, it's really hard to corporate just in like a world. It's so like, yeah. And also a big place where they found a gigantic stash of lithium is Afghanistan. The trillion dollar minerals. Yeah. So there's a reason why they're there. There's a bunch of reasons why they want to control Afghanistan and almost none of them have to do with some dudes and a dressed up like during the fucking star wars movie, San People, thousand dudes with guns. That is not why we're there. That's fucking bananas. If you believe that you're absolutely out of your fucking mind. There's a massive amount of heroin there and there's a massive amount of minerals and the heroine is the craziest one because that's the one that makes people go, oh, you just crossed into crazy land son.

Speaker 3:          00:27:02       Do you think the United States government would be involved in selling heroin? You know what? We don't grow it here. So yeah, I don't see a lot of it around pharmaceutical companies need to opium late techs to manufacturer pills and the Pharma lobby is fucking huge here. And I mean opn, 90% of the world's heroin comes from Afghanistan now. Yeah. And we know when I talked to Shane Smith from vice.com he was breaking down from me in numbers. How much more heroin is available now and how easy it is to get. And it's a direct correlation. Cine United States being involved with Afghanistan, that's when it started. It's like so transparent. It's just in your face. There's videos of soldiers walking down poppy fields with machine guns and for the soldiers, they must feel like this is not what I fucking king here for. You know, I thought I was going over here to fight bad guys. I mean mom protected poppy seed.

Speaker 4:          00:27:51       What's crazy is I've seen a lot of people, uh, who are excited before they go over there. I've yet to read a single account and you know, a credible publication saying like, I went over there and it was a great experience. You know, I haven't seen that at once. Not even one time. You think if that happened that they would promote that a lot. You know, but I never hear that and maybe it's out there. I'm sure like one of your listeners has had that, but I don't hear that.

Speaker 3:          00:28:14       I hear horrific stories. I heard a lot of horrific stories from Iraq as well. There's a guy, uh, there's, you know, there's videos of these veterans that sit down, I forget the name of the group, a rack. It might be that, but he was just telling all the different stories of the people they killed and why they killed him and how they're, uh, sergeant, whoever it was was going to give them extra days off. They killed somebody with a knife, you know, and you hear shit like this and you're like, whoa. Like this is like, they're just promoting like a bunch of assassins to just run through streets and kill people. You know, they seen the photos of people holding a little kid's head up, the kids like naked and he shot and the guy smiling next to him, like, you just shot a deer. Have you seen that? Yeah, man, that's, that's our soldiers. You know, if that's at all possible, even even for one guy, we need to hit the brakes on this thing and figure out what the fuck we're doing. Because it's not just that we're making money. Okay. It's not just someone's making money, they're making psychos. They're making, they're making people that are probably never going to be the same again.

Speaker 4:          00:29:14       Look at what they do to the, some of the inmates at Guantanamo, they put them in a sensory deprivation. And then this one dude in 2006, he had to see a dentist, I think his name is Jose Padilla. And, and uh, when he was out in the outside world, they put headphones on him and goggles so that he could not see or hear anything. And he started going into convulsions because his mind is so fucked at this point from no, no, no stimulation over a course of like a year or something that he's just totally gone inside. And when he spoke with his lawyers, he thought that they were interrogators pretending to be lawyers. So he's like, he's gone. They can't, they can't even let it go. Let that go because you've totally fried his mind. And now he, if he wasn't before, now he certainly is a fucking psycho.

Speaker 7:          00:29:55       How long did they have them in there like that for?

Speaker 4:          00:29:58       Uh, I don't want to miss like give you the wrong time, but it's a lot like a long time. Like hundreds or thousands. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:30:04       Well the media likes to paint these people was like, oh, they're just a few bad apples, you know, England or whatever the fuck that woman's name was. He was like pointing at the dude with the hood on his face. And you're like, but Rumsfeld's tort, like memos circling Shit. And he's like more of this, more of this. I mean, it's totally fucking systemic. And the chain of command, I mean, these people are,

Speaker 5:          00:30:21       you're going to place a lot of the blame on the, on the people that are keeping the soldiers over there because you've got to imagine like being in a war zone for that extended period. Now I'm not like excusing the, some of the most more horrific acts. Like, obviously that's, you know, those people had some issues before they got there. But, um, you know, if you keep those soldiers over there for what had been at war for a decade, I mean eventually, you know, it's going to, cause, I mean, I'm sure there's the number of people coming back with psychological issues is skyrocket.

Speaker 7:          00:30:47       I'm sure I'll continue to go up to outnumbered deaths in battle. Yeah. Isn't that incredible that just, that number alone? I mean, has that been this discussed? No, I seriously doubt. How could you not talk about that? That's a big issue. It's a huge issue. It should be on the, because they want to pretend like the government gives a shit about the troops. That's why the whole thing's very shocking. It's very shocking when you got this far

Speaker 5:          00:31:11       that comes back to Nda and because some of the funding for the NDA covers like veterans benefits for veterans. And so it's when they're talking about attacking on ride ons, like the indefinite detention section, um, they're basically holding, um, like veterans' benefits and pay for, um, for soldiers like hostage. And they're like, you know, we have to pass this through. Or they're using it as an excuse like Obama did. Like we have to pass this through otherwise are

Speaker 7:          00:31:37       veterans are our, you know, our soldiers aren't you?

Speaker 5:          00:31:40       You get paid and like, well why don't you just remove that and we'll go ahead and say, okay,

Speaker 7:          00:31:45       how is it legal to package a bunch of shit together and have it count? Welcome to Congress believably ridiculous, shove things in there that make no sense, that are like really bad and shove it into something called the Patriot Act

Speaker 5:          00:32:00       second earlier about the knee, how they, how they name buildings. And like there's one where it basically like, um, it makes, uh, ISP Internet service providers like log all of your activities so that the government, like whatever, like the FBI could access that if it needed to. I think it's like a period of two years and the,

Speaker 4:          00:32:17       that's what the bill does and what the bill was called. It was like the child protecting, protecting children from predators, molesters act, you know, and like, who's going to vote against that? If you vote against it, they'll slam you in the media. Of course, like, like Fox News for election, the commercial is going to be like, he voted against the anti child Molester Act. He loves pedophile. Yeah. Obviously. What I wanted to say really fast about the, um, what's so crazy about it is they have these ride ons or add ons. The section 10 21 and Obama supporters claimed that, well, he was, he was shoved in a corner. If he didn't, if he didn't sign it, some Republicans would have criticized him is if they're not already criticizing the shit out of him. Like if you were to have a president, Ron Paul behind that desk or a president, uh, Gary Johnson or President Joe Rogan, anybody, uh, you'd be, you'd be handed that and you'd say, no thanks. I'm going to veto this until this shit is out of there. And if the Republicans had an issue with it, you would've gone to the press and said, look, this section cannot be signed into law. I'm not holding them. When they say like, don't hate the player, hate the game. You should also maybe hate the player a little bit cause he fucking signed it. It would not exist without his signature. So for people to totally ignore the Obama involvement in this is I think dishonest.

Speaker 3:          00:33:26       So how, how is it possible that so many people could agree with this and want to sign it? How was that possible that I could got get to that point where they would draft something where they would

Speaker 4:          00:33:35       behind closed doors, that section, I think it was done behind closed doors. So it's not like they pulled the American people in on a episode of American idol. It was like we got 85% response saying we need to imprison you thought trial. It's like a couple of old dudes, Senator Mccain and Senator Carl Levin decided that this is what America needs and then before you know it, this is what American needs. I feel like they like gave Obama like the opportunity to try to save face by like saying he was going to veto it and like how could, how now could you like look at it and think that he ever had any intention of doing that? Right.

Speaker 6:          00:34:03       It will still have mental gymnastics. People are like, oh, but he's, you know, he's doesn't want it that Dah Dah, Dah. He's just the benign brand of the empire. I mean that's really what I'm online. Why would he be fighting against Mitt Romney Spotify

Speaker 3:          00:34:15       playlist? That's basically what it is, is the drone king. So do you think that we got tricked into thinking that Obama was something different by just what he looked like and the fact that he didn't have much history to go back on and you know, we just, idealistically I was like, well this is the guy. He's young. The pressure.

Speaker 6:          00:34:32       Yeah, it was the pressure valve from Bush. People were like, yeah, fuck yeah, like African American president. And he's like, has awesome rhetoric. But if you really analyze what he was saying he was promoting, you know, expanding the war in Afghanistan. I mean he really, but yeah, I sold a fucking billion dollar ad campaign. Hope and change, Bro. You also like to change and some of the campaigns, there's one in 2000 wouldn't want that.

Speaker 4:          00:34:53       Yeah. And in 2007, he said, uh, if even one Arab American is the Tange without a trial that affects my liberties. And uh, like you can pull up that video where he says that and you're like, what about the NDA? Like now you're,

Speaker 3:          00:35:05       what do they do to them when they get them an office that gets them to behave like this? Is there something or are they just all full of shit? Is it they're, they're all full of shit and by the time they get there, it's just they've been so good at being full of shit for so long and they've kept the record clean and they, they're going to pull off the big position. Is that it?

Speaker 4:          00:35:22       I don't think the parties would promote a candidate that they didn't think it would eventually fall in line.

Speaker 6:          00:35:27       Well, it's not even a party is its banks. I mean Goldman Sachs was the top donor to Obama's campaign. He's now that they're not at the top donor to Romney's campaign. So I mean it's, it's all just a favor doubt

Speaker 3:          00:35:35       though. Do you think that they get and they say,

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       listen dude, you got to just do what we say and if you do what we say we're going to keep you moving along. But if you don't do what we say, you know it's over. Cause that, is that like a real conversation they have. I don't think there's like a smoky room went dude saying like Yo, here's the fucking JFK real, you know,

Speaker 6:          00:35:54       video of JFK getting assassinate. I just think it's the, the corporate machine. I mean you know what you have to do, you know the game you have to play in order to put Nigga shit pass and fucking hold your head up.

Speaker 1:          00:36:04       But they just like guarantee. I mean they just trust him to keep going along those lines. It seems kind of crazy to me. It seems kind of crazy that you can see as much of what's wrong with the government. That's Obama must be able to see it must go to save the horrors of the war. He's a smart guy. I mean, he's not an old fucked up dude. He's a guy that's in touch. He's gotta be paying attention. He's gotta be looking at these suicide numbers. He's got to be looking at this horrific situation, this saber rattling for going to war with Iran. Him. He has to be looking at this in Har. I think part of it is bad advisors. I mean, look at who he's surrounded by. These aren't, these aren't new young people. These are like the same people. There are the establishment.

Speaker 1:          00:36:46       A lot of these people, so maybe he's so insulated like he used to talk about like I don't want to wind up in a bubble and now he's most definitely in a bubble. He goes on, if you were to go on Msnbc, they would just kiss his ass for 30 minutes and not mention NDA wants as the idea of a president. Ridiculous. Do we need to abandon it because it seems ridiculous to me. It seems like one guy representing the entire country is a silly monkey thing. It's a silly alpha male. She'll be a bunch of jet eyes, you know, a bunch of smart people all sitting around in a circle, kind of like 20 people. A bunch of dudes that have done the cave as a bunch of people who've done that Dave Asprey brain thing. Yeah. That is what congress is supposed to be, but it's not,

Speaker 5:          00:37:27       they're acting outside of their mandate as a government. Like a lot of the things that they're doing right now, there's really no, like it's everything that they're doing, it's like unconstitutional and we're just so used to like putting up with it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:39       It's hard to call them. There's so many, and we're getting like flooded with these bills that are obviously, they're all unconstitutional and every once in a while they slipped one through it. It's all the idea behind it is what's completely UNAMERICAN, you know? Uh, we, we have this idea of what, you know, what America's supposed to stand for. At least we used to, that that idea is getting eroded, eroded more and more. You pay attention to what's really going on in the world. It's a sad time to be alive in that sense that it's, we have so much going for us where we're so technologically advanced were so we were able to communicate with each other and exchange information in ways that have never been possible before for any human being ever. And yet we're still living like fucking crazy. Barbarians were still launching rockets and to villagers, I mean these double tap drones, the fact that we're not there and we don't see it doesn't mean that what you're doing isn't fucking terrifying. Horrific murderer, shit, feminism to double tap, oh, it's a double tap. What that means is they shoot the drones into the building and then they come back like 20 minutes later and shoot again because people have gathered up to get rid of the,

Speaker 7:          00:38:45       the sick people in the target mourners and people who are like combating the sick and wounded and drones have a 2% success rate to fucking percent success rate. So that kind of deterred underminded that whole logic like drones or the strategic, they're surgically precise now. They're not at all 2% are think one in 47 something like that. End Up on the wrong dudes excel spreadsheet, a Predator drone headed. But how crazy is that idea that you can murder 47 people as long as you get the one right guy. And that's, that's, and by the way, thousands of people died like this. The right guy. Like who is this fucking guy? We haven't put him on trial. Fuck. Are these people that were killing anyway,

Speaker 1:          00:39:27       relabeled the term militant basically defined it to include just any, anyone of that could be of age. They're so low Custer to be like part of like one of these groups. They're shooting fucking rockets from the sky in robots. That is the most ridiculous shit ever. They're fighting pre crime. They're like, these people look suspicious. They're definitely doing some militant like, shit, let's just get rid of all of them. You know? It's a weird way to turn a human into a number. It's just bizarre that because we don't see it within a footage of it, we're not there. What's happening? It's not happening over here. We're just like, oh yeah, we use drones and it's so relaxed or opinion on is that Obama can make jokes about it. Like remember when he does, he was joking about dating his daughters and he said, I've got two words for you.

Speaker 1:          00:40:17       Predator drone. That'd be funny if he didn't actually have mean. Yeah. It'd be funny if thousands of people hadn't died already because of these things. A lot of them, most of them innocent. I mean, and he's joking about it. Like what kind of weird disconnect is that I give her if you're just a regular dude and people would say, oh, you're being sensitive. It's just a joke. That's a crazy thing to joke about. You know? That's like Lizzie Borden joking about access. You know, it's a little touchy. That's a weird joke. Zero transparency with those types of kills too. I mean, you don't know who you hit. It's hard to get. Got to move up to the microphone. Sorry, I want to talk. Yeah, I was saying like there's zero transparency involved with that type of technology. There's no way for us to like confirm who we killed or who was down there and every organization help her number. We don't go back to help them. Sorry. We had to kill this one dude. I started with fucked up everybody and blew up your babies, but we had to get this one dude. Now we're going to help, you know, there's no help. They're just robots from the Scottish shoot rockets and they call the rockets hell fire missiles. Like, wow.

Speaker 7:          00:41:17       How crazy is this? A domestic drone thing? The thing that scares me the most of, of course, aside from the spine grid that's going to be surveilling all of us. Um, you can, you can hijack these rounds. So people who are just hackers can just hijack these fucking domestic drones and use them as like, that to me is fucking terrifying. Crazy hacker can hijack the drone and tell it the slim knew his girlfriend's apartment. Exactly. That's going to happen. I mean, that Shit's real. Yeah, right. No kidding. How Sad. How sad is it that our technology's evolving and exponentially growing by the second yet were stunted consciously. Our F our evolutionary consciousness is stunt into these archaic paradigms that just are just mechanisms of control, social control, fucking religion, political ideology. It's like, dude, we are applying to a system that does not like we are living in a system that does not apply to Myron society anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:42:14       It's strange how it just sort of snuck up on us too. You know? It's strange how there was like this disdain for Nixon likes. He sort of represented a, an unsavory dishonest character. And then, you know, Gerald Ford was kind of bumbling and then Ronald Reagan was loved and hated at the same time and now people go completely gotten loony on who, who he was and what he stands for. And then it goes from there too. It starts getting a little shady with Herbert Walker Bush goals, shady with the fucking former president of CIA running a government with what's going on. How's that guy? The President? He was a little weird. And then it goes from that to Clinton. Oh, we're back. Look at this. We got this guy, you know, this guy, smart as fuck. He's, he's a brilliant man and he says that he's so such a charismatic speaker and we have prosperity, economic prosperity while he's in office.

Speaker 3:          00:43:04       So there's a little thing, social disturbances from him getting caught in affairs and stuff like that, but all in all a good run. And then the shit fucking hits the skids. And then our entire view of what being American changes on September 11th from then on, it goes from anger to confusion too. You feel like you got tricked. It goes from anger. That American was attacked to confusion as to why we going over there. Two years later, we're still there and it doesn't make any sense and it has nothing to do with September 11th and you're like, wow, what the fuck? What happened

Speaker 7:          00:43:38       to almost accurate, what's the word I'm looking into? Just the best system that we have now. It's just like, well, he's better than Romney.

Speaker 4:          00:43:46       What's so crazy about the nine 11 situation when you think about it? Uh, I interviewed this guy, David Brin, who wrote a book about like transparent societies. And on one of the pages of his book, he was like, let's just, this is years before nine 11 he's like, just as a hypothetical, let's imagine that some terrorist, some terrorists, a blow up the World Trade Center, take down the twin towers. What would the government do in response with the federal government do? And he basically outlines the fucking Patriot Act. He's like, this is what they would do and this is what it would devolve into. And then that actually happened and this guy has the only solution I've ever heard. I don't know if it would actually work because there are a lot of impediments to this working, but the solution is we can't turn off the surveillance. We can't turn off the technological progress. What we can do though is use it against the gut, not it against, but

Speaker 8:          00:44:32       make it a two way street. Like instead of surveillance, he calls it suveillance where you're just walked. Everybody's watching everyone. So if we were going to have trap wire and surveillance cameras and all this shit, fine. But then we want to also be able to look in there and if it's supposed to be to keep us safe, why isn't more people a good thing? Why isn't crowdsourcing this? Why isn't that good?

Speaker 3:          00:44:50       I think eventually it's inevitable that we're going to get to a position just technologically speaking and where everyone's going to be accessible to everybody. Yeah. No, it seems like that's what the obvious trend is. I mean, it's gone. Whatever we are, whatever new technologies are created, they're not enhancing privacy. The new technologies are almost always enhancing connectivity there. Everybody's able to access each other easier and quicker, and Tumbler and Facebook days of your life will be on Netflix where you could go, I want Joe Rogan Thursday from three o'clock to four o'clock

Speaker 8:          00:45:21       what's he doing? Yeah. No people like, Oh my God, I love watching your life watching streaming. Nice, Bro. Well, they're going to get crazier than that Google thing. Whatever it is. I can literally watch you like pissing into a urinal and then put that up on youtube and like that. Yeah, for sure. Absolutely. It's like you could call it the piste diaries every night. We know. Yeah. You only turn it on when you go into the cam and he just, this is me pan again. It's 1132 more hundred gins and uh,

Speaker 3:          00:45:57       Phillip kind of a bitch and people were thinking of doing blokes to keep coming to here, but I'm just being, it would be like the popular one. Like wow, that guy's really honest about his pen. I like following him that being glasses are going to be so awful. The being glasses, he's just going to be doing gps. They're just going to shoot it into your ivy billion cameras. I'm going to watch everything that goes on inside and outside. He'll come through your skin RFID chips in their student Ids and like punishing them, monitoring their bathroom time. Right. Well your story ideas that they want to be able to find kids, you know, at least these are people that are, you know, under 18 and they have to be looked after and there's safety considerations and it's not like we're making them wear a chip, like inside their skin or anything crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:46:40       But that's always been there and I'm like, why now do we like, is it more dangerous to go to school now than it used to be like somebody got a contract to make these chips and put them into you. What parents are looking for is a good, good guidance in school and good teachers and safety that's still looking for that. I'm not necessarily sure that they're looking for these ra fid chips because you know those things are kind of sketchy. Those chips, you can get information from them and that's one of the reasons why they never did an episode on mythbusters spout it, you know, I said that it's one that was the one episode where mythbusters was told they're not going to cover that issue.

Speaker 8:          00:47:18       Yeah. So many, so many companies use RFID. The technology is everywhere. Well, the technology is not secure. It can be tapping

Speaker 3:          00:47:27       of them. Yeah, you can easily hack, but you know, you were saying earlier about the people

Speaker 7:          00:47:30       in the government, how they've been around for a long time. It's not even that. I mean all these people like Kissinger, even Madeline, all right, all these corporate heads, defense contractors, they all sit on boards of these think tanks that right our bills now, like no one fucking right to bills anymore. No Congress or the Senate passed too fast. We've actually written, one was changed in eight hours. It was like changed overnight. That was way more draconian and then everyone just voted for it because they were in the fucking post nine 11 fervor and they're like, yeah dude, we don't want to be unpatriotic. It's amazing how gangster it was, how they just ran in and immediately started doing shit like that. But it really, it's such fueled

Speaker 3:          00:48:10       the, the deep end conspiracy dudes, you know, we're obviously talking and conspiracy here. There's someone for sure is conspiring to control the government and there they don't want it to just strictly be the will of the people. That's pretty clear. And the, the idea that we're going to do these things in other countries and the other, we're going to do it for, you know, national defense reasons. Those also seem to be, it seems, it seems pretty obvious. Tom's, anybody's paying attention to, that's not really the case. So how long can you do that? How long can you run a game like that? How long do you think that they can keep doing that?

Speaker 7:          00:48:43       It's melted down in Europe as we speak. Uh, you're seeing the people there, they're unhappy about slightly different things. Mostly economic, but it seems like here, no matter how many rights you take away and how obvious in your face it is, most people just go along with it. Yeah. And until they feel it, I mean, right now you can keep people at bay until they're fucking feeling it. You know, who says like making us more pro, like the people more prosperous is a benefit to them anyway. Like sometimes maybe it's more beneficial for our economy

Speaker 3:          00:49:10       collapse. Yeah. But a lot of people have to agree with the way things are going in order to keep something like this going on. I mean at somewhere along the line in the chain of command, there has to be people that are questioning the direction that this is all going. Cause I don't believe that everybody that gets involved with government is evil. I think that's crazy. I think a lot of people that get involved in government are good people and they want to actually help. I think once they get in there and they see that fucking Barb wire quagmire that it is just a fucking, just a massive corruption. And I think then, you know, get becomes distant heartening. And oftentimes in life you kind of change what you stand for or change what you're there for and just sort of settle into the groove. You know, maybe you buy a boat, you know, and you got to pay your boat so you keep your fucking mouth shot.

Speaker 7:          00:49:54       Well it's like these people at the top half to see the collapse coming. They have to see that global capitalism and, and kind of the predatory shit that we're doing is not sustainable. I mean we're, we're focusing on a model of endless growth. I mean that that can't sustain itself. So these people have to fucking see that.

Speaker 3:          00:50:09       Well they, they do and yet they don't cause they do. And yet they feel like, well, we'll just adjust along the way and keep this pitch. Roland, it's not that you can ride the car forever without changing the tires. It's like, no, no, no, no, no. You're going to get some flats. He changed the tire and you're back on and you keep running. And I think that's the attitude that's going on there. It's like until the last drop oil in the ground, then we can go over to alternative versus sustainable energy and then we'll deal with it. Well, they, I assume they probably figured out, they think that someone's going to come up with some effective form of propulsion based on water or you know, there's, I mean there's been people that have made cars that have run on water. I mean that's already existed and converts to hydrogen. You know, it's complicated. But so it was making a gasoline engine, you know, it's just a gasoline engines had been made for thousands of years or hundreds of years. Has it even been a hundred years. My dating sucks weird that we don't have

Speaker 4:          00:50:58       Margaret Priority put on, uh, creating the next like energy innovation. I know that companies are spending a lot of money to develop that, but you look at individuals, I don't know a single person who's like, it's, I don't know, a single ambitious person who wants to develop the replacement to oil, but I know a lot of people who want to develop the next a hundred million dollar Facebook APP.

Speaker 3:          00:51:17       You were kind of, we think the oil issue is, uh, is really tricky because there's debatable science that shows that oil, uh, grows back in some areas, you know, and if it does, it takes a long time and no one's telling us how much is actually left. There's like real, it's a real questionable information when it comes to how much of a supply has left. The real question is though, do you just suck it all out full blast until it runs dry and when it runs dry we will see fucking havoc? Or is this communicated to the powers that be, is there any sort of preparation put in place with, you know, a harnessing resources, getting universities involved, bringing in scientific guys and saying, look, we've got to fucking do something. We had to do it now either we have to figure out some sort of solar power trains that are gonna take everybody around you. We're going to have to do something.

Speaker 4:          00:52:09       Well, he was saying that like this morning we were taught, we were taught, we had this almost exact same conversation last night and he was talking about how, um, some of like the economic control is so intertwined with our need for oil that it's difficult at this point to just transition over. Like the people that have control over the way our economy fluctuates. Um, whatever control they can have, the dollar would be garbage. Yeah. Without, it's linked to oil. Right. But we're not based on gold anymore. We're based on oil,

Speaker 3:          00:52:37       but it felt Boyle is a finite resource if it, but if it only has 30 years of full, full boat, I mean 30 years at this rate, which by the way, even though the oil is consumed less by cars today, there's more cars today. So even though they get better miles to the gallon, there's more of them and it takes oil to make these fucking things and it's like we're never going to stop making cars. People are gonna always want a new car and people were always going to try to afford a car and they're going to get a car and then at a certain point in time you're going to run out. And if they just run out, if it just would, would they be wise enough to like have any preparation in place? You would fucking hope. So that's the, that's the real question. It's like when you see shit like the Patriot Act being passed and then you see the Nda being passed, you see these, this crunched down lately, you see all this buildup in the military. They

Speaker 1:          00:53:25       should be, that's their idea of the preparation. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm worried. What I'm saying is when I'm looking at it, I'm looking at, if you look at the possibility that oil is a finite resource, that's what they say. I'm too dumb to understand it. I don't know who's right or who's wrong. There's a book called black gold stranglehold where some guy tries to claim that the oil oil is actually made. It's a process of the earth. I mean it's, it's some sort of fossil fuel, right? It's something that's created by the earth, but it takes like millions of millions and pressed carbon mattered. Millions magic. How much is there? You know, I mean they're talking about going into Alaska and pulling it out and apparently it's like super difficult to do that cause it's a different kind of oil, right? Like shale oil. It's oil, it's in rock.

Speaker 1:          00:54:07       It's in the oil company's interest to do, uh, to exaggerate their holdings. Like, Oh yeah, this, this plot right here has 100 billion, whatever. I'll use barrels beneath the soil or beneath the ground. Who knows if it actually does, cause it's your own proprietary calculation. How do they calculate it? I have no idea, but if you look up, you think about it like which sounds better to share holders. We might have a billion, a billion barrels or we have 100 billion barrels and who's going to challenge that? There's, I don't know of any like did that would be dependent analysis group. It does that confusing as fuck do you, could you imagine the day the oil runs out you want to talk about a horrific symbiotic connection that we have. We have like as a side, the only way you can make this work at all is if you have oil, the jets that fly people across the country for Fedex envelopes and anything you want to get done over night and everything that you have that's made out of plastic.

Speaker 1:          00:54:59       Almost all of that shit. It comes from oil and if we really are going to pull that stuff out of the ground like that and we really are just going to get it full blast until the wheels fall off. That could be what they're preparing for. If they know that there's only a few years less to the left of this, that could be what they're preparing for and that's a terrifying idea. It's a terrifying idea because I don't know what the alternative is. If I was in charge and I knew that the fucking wheels are going to fall off and there was nothing we could do and people are going to starve and go fucking fond, Zombie in the street is going to be no more oil. I don't know what I would do either. I don't know what I would do. Yeah. These people are really not looking past their bottom line every year after year.

Speaker 1:          00:55:38       I mean they have to be seen. How many people would know if there was only 20 years left of oil, how many people would know? I mean, how many people would really be aware of that? It is pretty common knowledge that we have. I mean, oil is not, oil is not a fucking infinite. I mean that we'll know by the price like as soon as it became more rare, but they can, they can totally bullshit that to you. Right. How will you know how much oil they really have and why would they tell you? I mean, I would think that if they, if they did tell you it would be worse because then people would go crazy. Now, you know, the inevitable would happen. Now it's easier for them to do that because the price of oil now, like the way it's speculated on like it's way over priced. So they could actually, as it becomes more expensive for them, they can hold it at that price for quite a while before

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       they end up having a short, I mean it would just, their profits would go down a little bit. But what he's talking about oil, well, what I mean is like as we go less and less oil, like they've speculated the price of oil, it's a lot higher. You know, it'd be like $100 dollars a barrel when it's really only like 60 so even if they started to run out, they can maintain the illusion that it's holding it $100 a barrel

Speaker 3:          00:56:44       for so, and we wouldn't know until it was almost too late. Well, it'd be too late anyway because they told you that we have 10 years left of oil. You have 10 years left or then then it's over. It's too late already. Yeah, because 10 years, 10 years tops, not enough time, none of bio. By the way, people are going to go straight crazy. If you pick people, if people found out that there's 10 years left to the oil right away, people would fucking start committing suicide. They wouldn't be able to deal with it and we'll go crazy

Speaker 6:          00:57:10       taking the oil out of the ground and look what it does at Damn. It just destroys everything and we have sustainable alternative resources that we can start investing it. I mean, there are options. It's not like we're looking at me like what the fuck are we going to do? We don't hold on.

Speaker 3:          00:57:22       Well, you got to not talk over each other a little bit. Oh, sorry. The podcast things a little bit different than a regular conversation and it seems normal, but when we're both doing that at the same time, it's going to be a problem. People fall off ellipticals that way. They go down that way. Um, what were you saying? Uh, I don't remember. Oh, sorry. Um, it's, I don't know. [inaudible] our whole scene in this country is very confusing, but that's not, not in the, uh, not the most confusing aspect of it. The global warming aspect is terrifying to have. How many people want to put their head in the sand? That there's not something going on with the climate that could potentially damage everything? There's this weird conservative thing where they go, I like a guy in my Jujitsu class the other day. This guy is marine guy.

Speaker 3:          00:58:07       He's a nice guy, but he's like one of those fucking gung dude's and someone is talking about global warming, about watching something and he's like global warming's a natural process. And I go, what are you a fucking scientist or something? So it was a tornado. The can't get a good thing, but how do you know? How do you, how does anybody know? I mean, how the fuck could anybody be a 26 year old guy? Especially be so confident that you, you can say, you know what changes the fucking temperature of the earth. Which by the way changes radically over a period of a thousand years. Cause the point where there's places where you used to be able to live and nothing can live in them now like Antarctica at one point in time was nice and juicy and green and had rivers and stuff. Yeah. Not Anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:58:45       An asteroid is a natural process. Awesome. Fuck yeah. I mean, so if, if, even if it's naturally cause, which I don't really believe for whatever reason the earth is getting hotter and colder, it's getting more extreme. So we, you just start thinking about how do we fix that? Do we put shit up in the sky to it is natural. It is natural. I mean the, the natural d poisoning of the environment is a byproduct of the human being. And it's also cows. Cows fucking global, warm that shit up at places with their dirty farts. Delicious.

Speaker 6:          00:59:12       You love all the burden's on us. Like calculate your carbon footprint guys. And you're like, what are you gonna fucking do about the methane gas that you're admitting from all of these slaughterhouses? I mean, that's like 20 of all the initial

Speaker 3:          00:59:21       notes right there. Or just consumer of the largest polluting the world. My folks used to live in Pennsylvania when I used to drive to visit them. I had to go through an hour and a half of this horrific smell. And it was these farms in Ohio, the whole state of Ohio. Ooh, it's so bad. It's like coming in the events of the car. Terrific. It's just, it's shit and dead animals. That's what you're smelling. You smelling shit and rot. Yeah. Farts. Climate change is somehow a partisan issue. Like how did that happen? Like I don't understand why it's a conservative talking point. If you listen to conservative radio, they're constantly mock liberals, liberals, these lives, these lives in their global warming fee. It's unnatural process. There's data or scientific and they have this sort of no nonsense way about you that makes you, it's a very aggressive ideology. So it makes you want to be on their side, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:00:14       So it's sort of bullies you in a gold egg. It's a globe. It's a normal process. Meanwhile you don't even know what the fuck you're talking about. Like a guy. This guy interjected into this other people's conversation. I was involved, I was sitting on the sidelines and he just, he just, he walked up and they were talking and he just interjected this conservative talking point. It's like that's it's fastened. Dropped it. He's like boom, I'm out. Cause they do it. Like David's whole point is like who cares if it's a natural process or not? Like shouldn't we be doing something about it? Most certainly. But it is a natural process because people are cons. There's a good, there's a good graphic. Every time I fucking see somebody throw a cigarette out the window, I'm like, why is that so easy for you to do? Why is it so easy for you to just, let's just make shit worse.

Speaker 3:          01:00:53       Why is it so easy? Right? Because we have a disconnect. Human beings or there's something missing in the way the human society is currently run because it's all about the end, the line. It's all about getting, getting some awesome property, you know, gathering up your toys, living a good life, putting your kids in a good school. That's like the, the, the bottom end line. And along the way there's, there's so little emphasis on enjoying the moment. There's so little emphasis on what you could actually be doing it, how you could be feeling, how you could be enjoying this life and how it is finite and it really doesn't mean you have to fuck find out and concentrate on what makes you happy and how many people get to do that. This is a small fraction of the people that are traveling with us on the highways and driving with us on the streets and that you run into every day that are actually happy people.

Speaker 3:          01:01:42       It's a tiny, tiny, tiny number because they're tricked into this country shitty world. There's tricky fucking goofy world where there's a thing called the federal bank that's not really federal and it has control over all the money and it's not based on anything. And the money's not really based on anything anymore. It used to be based on gold, but now it's just kind of confidence. Like you grow up with this shitty fucking system and it's so disheartening. It's so hard for people that have to pay taxes to this system and have to spend into this system. It's so hard for them to just keep doing it and be happy. You know? Even if you have a good job that you enjoy and you can't afford to live where you live because you have to pay too much taxes. That's maddening. That drives people crazy. Like you can't live in a nice neighborhood and you have to live in a little bit of a Shitty your neighborhood because you've got to pay 40% of the government.

Speaker 7:          01:02:32       Can you imagine if, if society rewarded you for creation instead of like, I mean all the, like the, the, the smartest people in this country are working to for destruction. I mean, how did like build bombs and kill people? It's like, what if we rewarded rewarded people and creativity? How to scam you with ads on Facebook, all that. Yeah, the Predator drone or scam you out of money. It's amazing. We're just stunting our potential so much for human growth and our consciousness. We're on the cusp of greatness and there's just a couple of psychopaths sort of like cock blocking us,

Speaker 3:          01:03:07       Paul. It's a, there's a whole culture of the uninvolved unevolved. There's a a culture of people that still have this fucking buck Rogers view of the world. It's not, it's not a small amount. It's a lot of people. It's people that haven't had any psychedelic experiences. It's people that are from really dumb environments than the in they're, they're, they're prone to imitating their atmosphere and the atmosphere is filled with idiots and it's not a small number. It's a big number. Unfortunately, this more, almost 50% of this country believes that the earth is less than 10,000 years old based on scripture. Almost 50% of the country. That's more than a hundred million people. That's craziness. Let's sad it has in. It isn't. It's fascinating and it's, it, it's, it's, it's weird. You know, it's like if you see those videos of people like that go to these strange rain forests and they, they find this tribe that's never seen people before, they catch it on camera, cause some fucking weirdness to it, right? When you see like, wow, you know, these poor people, they're, they're living in here with leaves on our dicks and jumping from tree to tree and then you look at

Speaker 7:          01:04:08       la. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:04:10       You look at, you look at our society, you look at our, our craziness and you somewhere along the line, I think everybody has to conclude that no one really is in control of this fucking thing. It runs on momentum and whether it's good momentum or bad momentum, it runs on momentum.

Speaker 4:          01:04:25       That's really important when you're looking at the, looking at the election, you see like the bullshit. It propagates because of momentum. Some people who are really anti Romney, you're trying to push this sense Sada story, however it's pronounced. It's his company that he used to invest in that outsource American jobs. The Chinese workers. I think that's like that's like the cliff notes version and uh, they're trying to make this a huge issue so they're just like blowing up Twitter feeds with it and asking journalists to cover it and the facts are that it's really not that big an issue. I'm not saying this is some kind of like Republican shill. I'm an independent, it's just like it's clearly not a big fucking issue. He used to invest a small amount of money in this company and like it'd be like if I own shares of Microsoft five years ago and then you came up to me and you're like, dude, the Zune sucks. Why do I care about that? I don't own any shares of this company. And like if I did it was a small share. And how is that the most important thing happening now when you

Speaker 1:          01:05:17       should be going after maybe like some of his beliefs, sort of his beliefs on the war, on drugs continuing that is belief something we need to increase our defense budget. I think those are more important issues than some fucking obscure company that he might have invested in a while ago. It's weird that Mormons, generally speaking, I like super nice guys. Like I've met a lot of Mormons and one of the things about them is they're like almost like to a man changeovers friendly, gentle, gentle lovers. Do you know what I'm talking about? Like they seem to be like sort of a peaceful religion. Very nice. But it's, I think it's hostile to think that you have to convert other people to your belief system. Well, it's nice to be like in a tie and be friendly to people, but if your underlying thing is these people are idiots because they don't believe what I believe.

Speaker 1:          01:06:00       Well it's a cult. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm just saying it's a cult that makes nice people. If the outcomes, it's a cult and, and, and, and even if you know you, you want to diverge from, you know, that you want to say all religions are called, well maybe, but here's when they're clearly calls. When you know the guy who wrote it. Yeah. It's like 50 years ago. His fucking name is Joseph Smith in 1820 really liked women. So that's why you get the multiple wives. That's by the way, why Mitt Romney's families from Mexico, Mitt Romney's family comes from I fucking religious compound in Mexico. They separated from the United States because they wanted to fuck more bitches. That shows leadership leadership, having your own compound in Mexico. That's dope as fuck, dude. I just moved there because he want 20 wives. They were like, you can't have 20 wives.

Speaker 1:          01:06:47       He was like, oh bitch, I can, I'll just got to go here. And when they did it too, it was in the 18 hundreds and you know, there was no cars yet. So America wasn't quite as awesome as it is now. There wasn't really that much of a difference between living in Mexico and living in Texas. You know, he just went over there, okay, now I can do it. Let's just buy some land here. It's cheap. We'll fucking make a bad ass compound. They outsource themselves. So that's why midst dad could never be president. And His dad wanted to be president, but he was born in Mexico. Shazamm sorry. Isn't that crazy? He mean he's a full on nutter. I mean he's not just from a cult. He's from the branch that left the country because they wanted to continue their, their multiple wife practice.

Speaker 1:          01:07:28       You can have multiple wives, but you can't marry a gay person. That's bad. God doesn't want it. I'm old. Marriage is next. Medical marijuana don't believe in it. I believe I'm just turned up. Can I play devil's advocate on the door on me since he, since we actually have a record of what he did when he was governor of Massachusetts, we see that he did not try to, for example, uh, in prison or execute women who use like the morning after pill. He said that he didn't do this shit. You know, like, so like some of the fantasies coming from certain elements of the left. Uh, and I hate to use terms like the left and the right, cause I'm totally against that stuff. But these fantasies, it's like he was governor, he was a powerful guy. He didn't do any of that shit. He was fairly moderate. You can attack him for being a kind of a heartless person, but he is not nearly as extreme as I think, as people think. And as he's portraying himself to be. Well, I think he's very flexible and I think he's, it's what's

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       really important for guys like Mitt Romney has to be in power and Massachusetts is a very liberal state. I grew up in Massachusetts. You can't get by on just total strict Republican, you know, rhetoric in Massachusetts, it's not going to work. So he sort of went with the flow of the thing. That's what I think. And I think he's a, that's the most dangerous thing about him is that he doesn't seem to have like real strong opinions on things. I mean, he seems to know how to make money with, you know, I don't understand what they do. I mean, I've tried to look into like what's supposed to be so evil about Bain capital, but it's, to me it's, it's numbers nonsense. It's all craziness. I read the Matt Taibbi article in Rolling Stone, which is a another mind fucking sort of a view where you're like, why do you make money doing watts? Like I need to do it. And then they move it from here and then they give them loans.

Speaker 6:          01:09:05       He never pay it back and like walked off. Fuck Mitt Romney said he harvests business businesses for profit. Sounds like ma the matrix and harvesting human being. But do you know the bank capital? Bain capital is actually integral into a pushing Monsanto into biotech. So Bain capital. Yeah, Mitt Romney got $1 million from the ex CEO of Monsanto when he was starting off at Bain capital and he got pushed into, you know, he's very tight with Monsanto. So as Obama they all are,

Speaker 3:          01:09:34       it's so creepy when you find that the history of Monsanto, you know, everybody thinks about, Oh man, these genetically modified foods are dangerous. How about AZT? How about fucking, how about Agent Orange?

Speaker 6:          01:09:44       The chemo with Agent Orange, that company making your DHT grains that are in your cereal. It's crazy to his cancer medication. Ddt and DDT, they made

Speaker 3:          01:09:53       Agent Orange and here they are making a call on hollow.

Speaker 6:          01:09:57       How's about how a lot of player, I fucking poison the shadow Alyse then Alabama for like decades and knew about it and everyone's like dying and they're like, oh yeah, our bad. Sorry about that. Was it with the use PCBs just dumping the shit in the water and everyone's like retarded now. Whoa. Why would they dump it in the water? Just because they could, they had it and it was there and that's how they got rid of it. Wow. Zero regulation.

Speaker 3:          01:10:20       It's a, the, the Indian farmer things, the scariest thing when you feel God, hundreds of thousands of Indian farmers have committed suicide is does it, how would, how are they connected to Monsanto by choice or is it like they have no choice where to buy their seeds?

Speaker 6:          01:10:35       Um, they are, yeah, they're being forced. Well, one of our main thing and the government is forcing Monsanto seeds on them and so they're burning them and people are just like, why would poor people burn food? And you're like, because they'd get it like they don't mean it's crazy like owning non-regulated seeds or something like that. Like if you, you have to get your seeds from a certain way, the most sinister shit out there and also creates mono cropping and destroys local agriculture. If there is a god, a seed is clearly designed to be something that should not be regulated or bad cause it drops through the fucking tree. You know, like it creates more of an eat. Some of them, it creates more of them. Like it's not something that's supposed to be a Somby competitive

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       products. We're making Zombie plants that can't make babies, you know, so you have to keep buying seats from these fucking, this, this evil group of people that's planning, grading super worms and shit though. So it's like not even going to work anymore and that's what's going to be really scary about it. The idea of, of doing it for profit too. It's just so, it's so crazy how much money can make doing that. And they're getting away with it. And now they see the study that shows his tumors that are some rats that are eating genetically modified corn. Creepy. Well, you know, it's not an actual food. There's, there's a, there's a crazy battle going on. Ladies and gentlemen. This is just one of the rats get cancer from like everything, those fucking losers. But what about the terminates or alluded? That's a weapon on down made a terminator seed that destroys it.

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       So after one year, no, it's swear to God, it's, it destroys itself after one yield. You're like, why would you even have to make that? What are you going to use that for such a your seeds? So that's just the fuck over. Barch a god thing. It's such a claim. I mean, you're playing God, you're, you're actually fucking with life. And because it's a plant, we were like, ah, it's just a plant. It's still life. That's a living organism and you fucked with it. And now you're growing your own organism. And then you wrote, you wrote that you own this organism. I mean, Jesus Christ, you own it. I mean, it's like a dog. Like you know, this is your shit. You know, you've made little robot seeds, the you, you now, you now you own all these, you seldom these people and they can never use them again and they can't, they don't grow.

Speaker 1:          01:12:39       So the whole idea behind it is insanity. It's insane that you could be able to patent life where they actually outlaw collecting rainwater too. So, you know, you get the idea that no one's protected, that no one's come in and protected that and said, listen, you cannot own life if you can't patent life, you can't. You can't have the genetic code for pigs. Yeah, you want another one? How about bottled water? We were talking about this yesterday. If you're to go back in time 30 years and tell somebody, uh, 30 years from now, you're going to have to pay $2 50 cents out of a machine for a bottle of water to hotel. And on top of that, most of our wars are going to be fought by robots in the sky. People at the venue are like schizophrenia. That's crazy. Shit. Water's free. Just go down to the daughters told me that even years ago, I probably wouldn't believe you.

Speaker 1:          01:13:29       The water, the issue is a, is a tough one because you know, some people say it's just drink, tap water. It's safe. Like Penn and teller had a whole show about it. But no, it's not really okay. Because there's fluoride in it. And guess what flora? It's poison. I mean it's a very low level poison and the idea is that floor, it's supposed to kill the bad things that are on your teeth to give you cavities. And that's, I guess maybe that it does that, but you really could get away without it. You could brush your teeth without using fluoride. Fluoride is fucking kind of dangerous. It's not healthy for the body. And you know, you drink water with fluoride in it all the time. There's been studies that show that it could calcify your pineal gland, which is where Melatonin and DMT or produced like that fluoride actually can fuck with the chemistry of your brain if you take in a lot of, especially if you're drinking a lot of tap water every day and you think about how much flora that there could have

Speaker 6:          01:14:15       bathing thinking, I mean you're already in consuming, I mean why, why is it that we accepted this propaganda? We still do that somehow the fluoridation of water supplies all across the country is good for us. I mean it's mass medication. It's a, it's a byproduct of phosphate mining. They sell it to municipalities and we drink it. I mean it's insane.

Speaker 1:          01:14:33       Yeah, and by the way, it was one of Hitler's ideas to fluoridate the water to keep the population numb. Those Hitler's idea, like it was much more fluoride I believe. Then we use now I think, you know, ours is less and sinister and I think they did it because someone tricked them into doing it for, you know, the idea of a dental hygiene. It's like, we ha I had this Guy Dave Asprey on the show yesterday and he was talking about how bullshit, how much bullshit is involved in the idea of a salt of having a low salt diet and how crazy that is. And he was talking about how that's just propaganda that stuck around like a no salt diet. How's it supposed to have plenty of salt? My salt salt's in essential minerals. This Guy Dave Asprey, carry salt around with them. He brings salt with him everywhere.

Speaker 1:          01:15:16       He goes like he has salt every morning. He says it's like an essential, like part of being a human animal. You need it to retain water. Yeah, everybody needs it. It's just one of those things where you know, you get sold some wacky bill of goods, you know, like, remember, do you ever remember those commercials that they used to have where they had doctors suggesting particular types of cigarettes? It was a crazy, it helps with digestion as your meal. God. Doctors are recommending where Shit today in cigarettes. Well, do you, um, what was the movie? Oh, Jay Edgar. The J Edgar Hoover. I thought that was good. It was good. It was good. The Leonardo Dicaprio movie and in it she says that the doctor prescribed him cigarettes for his health, like to make them more robust. There's a prescribed cigarettes,

Speaker 4:          01:16:03       it was on mad men and there was actually a movie that came out a few years ago and like it was kind of post apocalyptic and the people who lived there like they would have to smoke cigarettes cause it had medication in it and protect them from like the like I think I've seen that that means they're just given them wheat. Salem Wenson must've paid a lot for, yeah, cigarettes are cast alive. You, you said stuff about, it's like you didn't really like it because it kind of sucked.

Speaker 1:          01:16:28       I enjoy it as background. I put it on when I write sometimes visually. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:16:32       It's the length that I tweet it to you about that. What about it? Uh, they created a fake corporate website for Wayland, which is the company that backs their mission. Right. And from atheists and on the website there's all kinds of shit. Like there's a fake Ted talk given in the year 2023 or he's talking about how like now we can create android so we have the same power as God. Oh Shit. And they did such a good job with the website that you look at it and you're totally like, this could be Google and the next like 20 years or whatever big company happens to be around.

Speaker 1:          01:17:00       I think, you know, I watched promethium and that's one of the things I thought when there's like, you know, if we're from a [inaudible], you know, the year 2092 or whatever, what, 22 what was, what was the year? Oh yeah, it was like seven years and it was like 90 years from now or something like that. Whatever, whatever the fuck is spoilers. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. And uh, I, when I was looking, I was like, you know what, that is really underestimating how fucking nutty things are going to be. Cause that doesn't even look hardly nutty. The only thing that's nutty about that, they can go further into space. They'd go to sleep for a little while and they got holograms. That ain't shit. I think that's really underestimating. They sort of interconnectivity that people are going to enjoy just in the next decade. I think it's going to be wait crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:17:39       And then promethium I'm looking forward to like a psychic version of Gmail. It's going to be like, look, you're going to be connected. You're going to be connected to people in some other weird way. It's just the same way you are through your phone in a wireless way. Someone's going to figure out how to make that something that speaks directly to your synapsis. They're going to make it. Yeah, absolutely. There's gotta be something like that. There's going to be something that allows you either in a clinical setting, it will probably be that way first and then it's just going to integrate into your life. You know? It's Kinda got to figure out a way. It's everyone's going to need God. God Damn Electric toothbrush. Everyone's going to have one.

Speaker 7:          01:18:10       Well, I was, I was kinda disappointed. I don't know what you were saying about probate this earlier, but I'm really into that theory too, that aliens created us and so I was like kind of like, fuck yeah, they have like a movie about this. Then I was like, aw man. It kind of just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Shit version of the idea. Such an idea

Speaker 1:          01:18:28       the, yeah, the ancient aliens theory debunked or ancient aliens showed debunked is a fucking amazing youtube clip where a guy created this, his names, well I don't want to say his name, some it'd be, he doesn't want his name, but he's got to come on the podcast. Thank you. So I think he's out. Tom. Chris. Anyway, so he debunked and the whole, let's fucking, what am I? So it's not like he did anything dangerous when I'm saying Chris White. Anyways, very nice guy. We've been going back and forth on Twitter and this guy was a believer at one point in time and then just started looking into all the different things that they've claimed on the show and you know that shows goofy as fuck, but it's fun. This dude wrecked it. Aw Man. Crushed it. It means nothing now. It means nothing. I mean, it's still a lot of mystery until like the construction methods used for building the pyramids and moving obelisks and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          01:19:18       But he, he basically crushed them on all of their major points. I heard the diplomat just comes his hair to the side so glossy. He looks like me shaking his head just like, fuck this. It started off really good cause you're like, all right, the pyramids. Maybe this other shit in South America. Maybe. Then you run out of things to point the finger at and now it's like bigfoot. Was George Washington really influenced by an alien visitation and it's like you're just picking random things that of history at this point and trying to superimpose crazy. We were doing Samurais.

Speaker 7:          01:19:48       Yeah, that's what you need. You've gone too far. Samurais who could have come up with the technology to make the sword? Could it possibly have been aliens? Joe, have you seen Sam? Sorry yet? No. Oh Man. He's really fucking shit. What is it? Have you seen Baraka or choir get Scott to that trilogy? Dude, oh my God. It's just a fucking, it's just all images and, and, and really amazing images from all around the world. Uh, the, you know what, what did the film's called? Baraka and Sam. Sarah, I feel like I'm in a cult because I'm like telling everyone to watch and see what it is, so I forget who directed it. I want to say Phillip Glass at the music, but it's just all of the world's wonders and it's just so intense that it takes you into the soul of people and then like it moves to another image and then it moves to another image. Like there's a bunch of people climbing up mount. Yep. Yeah, I've seen that. Yeah. Yeah. It's incredible. It's incredible. I just feel like I'm, I feel like I'm tripping on mushrooms when I watch it because it's just so intense. Like it's just different cultures all around the world and the, and the juxtaposition between, you know, Modern Day society in ancient cultures and how they, they're living in the same time and then it's just incredible.

Speaker 3:          01:20:59       I bet that's going to be like the first technology when it comes to like really tapping into another person's life. They're going to create like a real for us and everyone's going to get the same real and you'll be able to put it on cause it takes a long time to record it. It's very difficult to process. So it's going to be like that game. Dragon's layer. Do Remember the game? Dragon's layer? No, it was the first video game and the dragon's layer video game wasn't really a video game. Like you would be shown an animated thing and then you'd have to move the lever one way or another way to get away or to get fucked like you, like one or one of them doesn't happen. Either you moved it the right way and then they would show you a new screen. Congratulations and you move on to the next round or it would show you you getting hit in the head by a giant boulder and dying.

Speaker 3:          01:21:40       It was the stupidest video game ever, but it was like really clumsy because they couldn't quite get it yet. Now they have full motion three d graphics that are absolutely insane and you play it, it's full immersion. I think that's what it's going to be like the first time you get a chance to peek into somebody else's brain. They're just gonna take a whole just segment of people from all over the world and make it into the one dope ass mix tape, put it on and get to like live changing lives. And then it's gonna move from there to the point where we're eventually all going to have the ability to transmit and receive.

Speaker 7:          01:22:12       Just get off the bench. It's gonna be really cool. They can record brand, they can record dreams now. Like actually, uh, get digitally, interpret them. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:22:20       Well they've, they've have been able to get blurry images for dreams. They've also been able to, uh, get blurry images from memory and they think that they might be able to figure out whether or not people are guilty or not and whether or not by whether some certain images exist in their memory. If they can grab him. I think in Grad just that means they can probably put in images. Yeah, well, by the way, I bet your imagination can put those images in there as well. And then it becomes the question of whether or not the mat, I mean, how much power does the imagination have over reality? Because a lot of people think that, you know, well, imagination is just what's not real. And a reality is what Israel. Okay. You don't want to be too imaginative, Jimmy, but the, the reality is that everything that real is created because of the imagination.

Speaker 3:          01:23:07       The imagination is the reason why we have tables. That's the reason why someone invented a rocket. It's a reason why a computer exists. If someone had a thinking and then it manifested itself in the real life, then the imagination becomes a very different thing because then it becomes something that you know, through a human and through the human touching things and moving things, manipulating with this idea, it can change physical reality. So it's not just an innocuous little thing floating in space. The imagination, when you sit down and come up with things and create things and actually physically make them, it made those fucking things. It did it through you. Then the question becomes can it do that to everything else as well and is it just we do, we look at the imagination is like, well we can control this because I'm a creative person and you know, I drink a lot of coffee and then I sit down and I do my work.

Speaker 3:          01:23:52       Is it, is that the case or is the imagination like a force that moves everything in the universe and we're just doing our little itty bitty bitty part of it? Well, yeah, I think the placebo effect is a prime example of something that no one talks about, but it's a fucking miracle. You're like, you're mine did this. Like how come? That's amazing. Why don't we focus more on the fact that the placebo effect is incredibly mind. My hands are able to throw it away because you thought that it was going to reality might not necessarily be something you'd knock on. It might be the the tune of the way you look at the world and your perceptions and your expectations can literally change what happens. That's a, that's a hard, you know what I mean? It can't be 100% because babies dying drive bys. There's like some weird shit that goes on there.

Speaker 3:          01:24:37       But then there's also the thought like if this is a continuous cycle, that's what so many eastern religions believe that you will come back and a lot of them believe you will come back until you get it right and you'll keep living the same life over and over again until you do it with zero mistakes. And you do it as an enlightened being from the time you were a baby to the time you leave and then you move on to the next stage of existence. So we're in this constant and endless cycle. But if there was a way to, to know that you were going to die and come back as a baby, but you had to take a chance that you're going to be a baby in a good house, how terrifying would that fucking trip be? You would never want to die. He would never want to die because what if you came up with some fucking asshole parents?

Speaker 3:          01:25:20       What if you came up with some abusive environment? What if you were born in Ethiopia and what if you're born some shit part of the world where you can't get out, you're fucked. If we had people that really believed that the only way to ensure your Karma, the only way to ensure you're safe passage as a child to adulthood is to go through this life being as loving and is careful and as considerate as possible and it's spreading as much positive energy as possible. If we really could get people to think that that would change reality because every baby would grow up in an environment where people did grow up in an environment where people love them because they didn't want to be stuck in some

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       fucking shit hole in the middle of Pakistan in a hut somewhere. Why drones are shooting missiles over their heads. I was thinking of Glendale, I was thinking where the, where the bombs hit man, where the drone son, if we get people to believe that you can get people to think, look the die, that might be real. I mean, it really, I mean if, I don't know, I don't understand the idea of reincarnation, but if it does exist, people are going to be terrified if they could prove that exist. Just that alone, but free people the fuck out. The fact that you just gonna keep coming back as a person and a new life every time. If you believe in the Dalai Lama and what he represents, uh, they claimed that he has the option of just like opting out next time you opt out of the body scanner at the Tsa.

Speaker 1:          01:26:47       He can just be like, I'm done. Like I'm not going to do this. And he doesn't want to be the Dalai Lama. And I see that he has that choice. Like apparently after he dies, he can tell whoever's in charge of the, you coming back in a body can be like, I'm just, I'm done with this. No more earth. He's just, he has that option. He's, he seems like a wonderful guy, but he stuck it in an ideology. He's dressed like an idiot. He's being silly as fuck. The whole thing is silly. It's completely silly. This clothes thing where you have to wear certain clothes to be, I mean you, you have to be completely expressionless in the way you keep your body warm. That's nonsense. That doesn't make any sense. If there's a real god, he doesn't care if you wear pants, it doesn't care if you have a fucking ACDC tee shirt on, he should wear whatever the fuck you want.

Speaker 1:          01:27:27       That's craziness. The whole idea that you can have sex with anybody, I'll come on, you know, the idea that it takes over and obsesses your life. Um, no it doesn't. If you get your shit together stupid, the idea that you can't have sex because it ruins your life doesn't always ruin your life dummy. It's sometimes it enhances your life. You're not living 100% full life. So this idea that you're enlightened yet not living, stop it. That's nonsense. You need to go out and he'd get need to get drunk and right now and then you need to have a shot of whiskey and need to go to Vegas and see what a real strip clubs look like. Maybe that's maybe that's a Mitt. Romney needs just a hard weekend in Vegas. He needs to go back to Mexico. It goes back to Mexico and fucking camp out with the Colton and load rifles as they look around for kidnappers. That's what they do. They talk up a black girl.

Speaker 1:          01:28:10       I think you just nailed it. A black girl really likes mushrooms. The lack of psychedelic experiences is a real problem for people that are in office. And I say that it sounds completely ridiculous, but I really think it's, you need something as a, as a human being, they need something every now and then the jolt you out of your walls of perception because we get stuck. You get stuck thinking that this makes sense. You get stuck on a momentous journey where you know the, the momentum keeps pushing you along the same path and there's no room to adjust, especially if you're part of a corporation and something big. Every corporation should have a fucking retreat every six months where they all go to the desert together and they all trip. They're fucking balls off. And then they rethink their life and then they get together and they have a meeting on Monday. And I go, what do you think? Well, the fucking Lizard Guy with the tail and the way he told me, I'm fucking up. And uh, they showed me the future and it's not good. We listen. We've got to get these suicides.

Speaker 6:          01:29:03       People's hands. Well, yeah, we can't be making,

Speaker 1:          01:29:05       making money off them that this is fucked. You know, they would, they would, they would realize the error of their ways, but instead they have a whiskey and an ambient and they go to sleep. And the, the drugs that we have available now, whether it's Oxycontin, which is readily available to anybody that stubs their toe, you know, all these different drugs that are available, they're available and they have a numbing quality to them. They have a quality that allows you to not look at the big picture, but just play your role and put your nose down and grin and bear it, you know? Do you know any fucking people are on antidepressants during the day and sleeping pills at night? It's a staggering number. It sends a recipe for insanity, like some of those civic because you walk around and don't remember where you were. Oh yeah. That happens a lot.

Speaker 5:          01:29:46       I used to work at a, a at a physician's office and he handled mostly like injuries and every single patient that came in there with like a work injury, they would get an antidepressant because they weren't working. So obviously they're depressed. Um, they would get a painkiller, they would get like meloxicam or something, but it was like a sedative and an antianxiety pill. And it was like five or six pills at, like almost every single patient would walk out with mass diag, you know, just diagnosing everyone that comes in there with anxiety and depression.

Speaker 1:          01:30:11       I had no idea it was such an issue until I had a few friends that, that got prescribed them and I saw it like changes in their personnel and so weirdness, you know, I saw people that acted irrationally. And then, uh, especially, um, when I was on news radio, Phil Hartman's wife was on Zoloft when she killed him, she was on Zoloft and cocaine. And apparently that is a psychotic combination like literally makes you psychotic. And to the point where the family got a settlement from Zoloft family got a settlement because of that and it's been shown to have, you know, horrific effects. So I, I started looking into it and then I found the numbers, the numbers of people that are on antidepressants and they're fucking staggering. It's staggering. And as far as like long term studies to see what kind of an effect that should has on you in 2030 years, have there been any, I mean do they know how about people who don't need them? Those people are part of an ongoing experiment. You are the data. If you're on those pillars here, the data that people, 20 years from now I'll be looking at,

Speaker 6:          01:31:09       well it's amazing every time there's like a famous person that dies from, from pills that are just like, oh they don't really talk about it wouldn't before it was like yeah, they died of his speed ball. It's like now this is legal heroin, legal cocaine, legal speed, way crazier. I mean fucking all the fentanyl patches and shit. I mean they're just like giving this thing. I called my doctor wants to consult about birth control and within five minutes she was trying to give me an antidepressant. I wanted to get pregnant. Or you didn't want you to know? No, I just was calling just to consult about like different kinds of birth control and she was just like, well are you feeling moody? And she was like, let's talk about your like moodiness. And she was like, I was like, is this illegal for you to like try to push meds on my second for the brain? It's like if you were

Speaker 1:          01:31:49       oh you are a person who like wasn't strong minded, you would go it just because your doctor recommended. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:31:55       America is one of only two countries in the world that allowed direct to consumer advertising with

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       pharmaceutical pills, US and New Zealand. Random. Right. She's my dad's a doctor and he hates the ask your doctor about, cause you're misleading people. Like if you think you have a symptom and like you're like, oh I got to ask my doctor about this to get it fixed. There are a hundred other diseases that could be causing that symptom and that's where you go to a fucking doctor in the first place so you can be diagnosed properly. But instead what happens is you go, this must be what I have because the TV ads so convincing you look it up on web MD. It confirms your ex your expectations. Yeah. This is what I have. You go to your doctor and you're like, here, you know I've done the research for you and then you're putting your doctor and an awkward situation where if he doesn't do it, you want them to do. You suddenly think he's not giving you the right care, but you really have to rely on an expert. It'd be like you don't see that for cars. You don't see advertisements for like, uh, you know you don't, you don't just walk into a car dealership and say, here's what's wrong with my car and need to do this, this and this. You tell them to check it out. It's kind of interesting that you can't sell cigarettes anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:32:53       That's the one thing. You can't sell an ads anymore. Can't have cigarette commercials except there's, remember that new one we saw with the electronic cigarettes? Oh yeah. It so sexy. Let me try to find who was Steven Bauer. No, no, no, no. Stephen Dorff. Yeah. Oh my God. Please pull that commercial up. Oh my goodness. Yes they do. It's not the nicotine. Nicotine is actually has some positive effects on the body. Nicotine actually is beneficial. It can help people with heart issues. Uh, it helps people be more creative. Like nicotine itself is as a drug, as a compound. Isolated compounds. Not Bad. What's bad is when you smoke it and he's smoking a cigarette form with 590 other fucking chemicals, they're all poured in there by your own, you know, approved by your own loving government just to make those cigarettes more addictive. That's when shit gets really bad. Make them burn a little bit better. Yeah. Shit into it. But let's be honest, this is kind of disturbing to watch that because it is still nick,

Speaker 4:          01:33:48       Tina, and people can still get addicted to nicotine, you know? Yeah, they can. You're right. Yeah. What's, watch this. This is

Speaker 3:          01:33:54       beautiful. I'm Steven door. I've been a smoker for 20 years and I just found the smarter alternative. Blue aesics blue lets me enjoy smoking without sexy years. He's a rebel. He's got to James that jacket on and best of all he said the beach. He's so cool. He's got a beach house like we're all adults here. Hello Ring. Oh my guys. It looks cool. I just want to go to parties with him. Oh Stephen Dorff. Does it

Speaker 4:          01:34:25       party with him?

Speaker 1:          01:34:28       Yeah, that's the kind of, if like you've met a guy and he liked it, pulled out a cigarette and started telling you how awesome it was like that he would run like the house was on fire and we just run away from him. You who fucking dis design that commercial commercial. If you looked in the eyes of blue smoke like that actory fuck you dummy. You got to choose. Either are selling shit. Are you going to be an actor? You can't be all actory. What does that, what it was that an emotional moment for Yale? He can considering your nest next

Speaker 8:          01:34:57       project on a kick that guy in the balls. When I said that commercial, that's insulting. Fucking insulting commercial. You fool, but I'm not hating us. Even a for me, if he got paid, go for it dude. Whatever. Just think you could have done a better job. I think you kind of phoned it in. I liked you in blade though, Dude. Pretty sweet and blade. That's saying you're a bad actor. I'm saying that Shit's preposterous son and take it from me. I've done preposterous shit. You got to know when you did it. You just did some black and white walk and by the beach with your fucking James Dean Jack and on sucking on a blue robot. Dick.

Speaker 8:          01:35:39       That's a blue robot. Dick. You really need to suck on that blue robotics. Come on man. Why? Why don't you just get some Nicorette Gum? You look at my like, he's fucking serious. He's serious and he's going to say something cool right before he shows you that it's blue. Yeah. This is like a scene in a movie that's making fun of the future. That's what it is. Johnny drama. This is like Johnny drama. Got a commercial. If he's acting it. If you are watching like uh, like one of those Arnold Schwarzenegger movies or like the Terminator or something like that where if they were making fun of the future, showing you a video of what the future would be like, this would be really robot fucking cigarettes and election man and this silly pitch is smoking them. What are you doing dude? He's a little wrinkly forehead.

Speaker 8:          01:36:22       He's fucking serious problem. Leno at a mountain, the Beach Doula surfing. Sometimes I just move sand holes. I'll make trenches and make my own rivers and they lost mode. You know, I make like these castles and I loved the fact that we're not going to be there and an hour they're gone, but they're there now. I live for now for now with my blue cigarettes. I was just thinking how you were saying that people are just generally an unhappy because they're overworked. They're not fucking following their true. We'll all this shit. I was just thinking the other day watching the soup because it highlights the most ridiculous reality shows that you can't even believe our fucking on TV. But just like the, my strange addiction, like people who eat scotch tape and shit, you're like, I'm sure they saw this. They're like, what the fuck? I was just only like first world problems.

Speaker 8:          01:37:08       Like can you imagine anyone else like having that problem? Like I can't stop eating couch upholstery. I have a problem. How about PD? The first world problems Hashtag on Twitter that people, yes. Yes. They took some of those tweets that were popular and they super imposed them or they didn't superimposed and they had kids and like really poor people in Haiti. Oh God. All right. This shit. It's a video you can look up. It's like Katie first world problems and it's like, I hate how my, my two door garage takes like 10 seconds to open and your mother were like starving animals in the background and stuff and it's like, it starts to hit home. Like you're kind of an asshole if you spend all day tweeting about stuff like that. Like it's okay to acknowledge that like you're privileged and you have a lot of shit that most people on earth don't have. But a certain point, maybe you give $20 to your favorite charity instead of tweeting that all afternoon. Yay. Silly Bitch. Hey Brian. How funny was that a video that you pulled up yesterday

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       and silent live video. You want to pull it out? Should we pull it out? It's so funny. They did a fight for, I've, I haven't washed out and lived a long time cause siren live went through this. It's really went through a spell where it was just, I couldn't watch isn't it getting better? I don't know. I heard but this is fucking fantastic. This is the first thing that I've seen from them in years and I only saw it because Brian was watching the computer, but it's them making fun of people complaining about apple products and then the people who answer or the Foxconn employees. Holy Shit. Is it funny to do? You got it. Tyna nbc.com unfortunately, so I'm trying to watch the commercial right now. Oh, you have to watch a 32nd one. What did it, I'm trying to sell you missiles. They did it, but yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:38:36       Don't be complainant bitch. You can easily be born in Ethiopia with no feet. Maybe we'll be, if you can play, maybe that mother fucker is a medium for knowledge there. Could you imagine if everybody that was in a shit situation just he used to mock people and shit situations in the last life. If it was that cut and dry, it was that easy to follow where the Kardashians headed. I feel like they're not real. I feel like probably from another planet and it's some sort of a, a device they're using to gauge our stupidity, like saying no, it's like a robot. It's like girl, she's like a robot fucked off in space. That's what I think because they've totally overestimated or position like her, her, uh, her physique rather, I mean her ass is just completely out of control. It's gotten just insane. It is growing and it's not growing in a natural way because their legs aren't growing with it.

Speaker 1:          01:39:28       Like if she became like some crazy power lifter and she just developed these giant muscular thighs, this huge ass, that would make sense. But no, someone in youtube describe it best. He said it looks like a diaper filled with putting, yeah, that's what it looks like. It looks like it's like she's doing something to it. She's making it bigger. The only episode I ever accidentally saw that show lies. Let me see your DVR right now. So I was the one, she had her like ass x ray to like try to prove that there was no implants. Really. So that only leaves like a couple of other options. It's a good use of healthcare resources. Well, how do we know it's a real doctor by the way? If it was covered, shit, his insurance, I mean most of the, like when they walk into a place and everybody goes, oh hi, nice to see you.

Speaker 1:          01:40:11       There's a fucking camera already there. They're showing you an over the shoulder shot. It's a fucking camera behind you and you're pretending you didn't know she was coming. We had a stop that he had a reality show coming into one of the doctor's office I worked in and I was like, I think she was like a gymnast or something and they just came in with cameras. But of course they were supposed to pretend like, oh, hey, you know what's wrong with you? It's fucking ridiculous. They don't have real reality shows anymore. What they have is like these low end producer guys who look sort of dictate what's going to happen in these scenes and then these clumsy fucks act it out. I watched a whole episode of Jersey shore the other day in my green room before a show where the situation wanted to leave and nobody else wanted to leave. And that was the whole show.

Speaker 3:          01:40:55       And I'm not exaggerating, sneaky, no, no, no, no, no. They were at a club or a club and uh, you know one's guy like, hey, you know the mall, he's an Asshole, but it is for me because you know, they get all the beaches and then snuck. He was like, I'm not leaving. Fuck you. I'm not leaving. And he's like, it's time to go. Like you wanted to leave. Nobody else wanted to leave. And that was the whole thing was them playing on this and you got to know like 99% of that's horse shit. That's doesn't, they're not really having this argument. They just decide that this is what it's going to be tonight. Tonight it's going to be the situation. Tries to get girls, but he's too aggressive so he wants to leave and then they, you know, they have, they did make it drama.

Speaker 3:          01:41:34       They, they turned it into like a script I live had, there's a channel called real TV, but every single show on it's fake fake reality shows. Well you remember what, how they're doing minding the store. You know, when they were doing the Pauly shore, uh, comedy thing, comedy store thing, or they had like a scenario that they would do every day. I look at it, that's how they do all, they don't trust that it would be like interesting enough to just follow your wife. I think it was Rutgers that paid snuck. He like 40 g to speak there. I was like, if I was a student, I did fucking quit. Like I'm not paying my tuition to pay sneaky to teach me life lessons. You get a refund. It would be fascinating. Now if she couldn't leave of, she had a certain amount of time and she had to answer questions, come on. That would be fun. That would be, she can't just not worth 40 grand, but yes, I wouldn't know. $40 I would sit through that and watch that. It'll be fascinating though, just to pick her brain. I don't, you know, I'm, I'm, I, I wouldn't, I don't hate her. She, who wouldn't do that if they, if you were, you were her, she was you. I would fuck it. Do exactly the same thing. That's the thing was shitty

Speaker 5:          01:42:36       people in general, like you think like, all right, if I were given the power to do this, this, and this, what I act any different. If I were like a riot cop and I was coming from that background and like a, B and c were set up as such, could I be any different, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:42:50       well, you become with the riot cops are real extreme example. Obviously pick the most experienced the most. Mostly you're, you're on the enemy. You know, you, you just, it becomes you versus them. There's no way of avoiding that and you'd have to be from a different culture. You know, I think there's a, things have happened in some, some countries where the, the people and the police officers don't have the same sort of antagonistic relationship to the United States. People do. But in the United States, if you are, if you're a riot cop in this riot, you're the enemy. You know, it's like, you know that guy's got a club and he's wearing a bulletproof vest and a fucking helmet. It's, you would, it'd be real hard for you to not act in self preservation by staying with the group.

Speaker 5:          01:43:32       We were discussing that like level of escalation, how the police were allowed to be like one level of hostility above you and they have like clear define levels of hostility and if, if you're at one level, they can be one level above you at all times, which I guess it's supposed to be a deterrent from picking up a rock. But the problem is at the same time they have people that are in clothes that are police officers doing things like that to antagonize the crowd. So they can move to the next

Speaker 3:          01:43:56       level. Yeah. The next escalation they're called agent provocateurs. They just, it was one of the occupy photos. It's hilarious. You see these fucking cops and the cops, I'll have these Vibram work duty in boots on and so did the guys. They're handcuffing handcuffing your bio protestors and they all have the same fucking boots on. It is the most ridiculous thing because, and then people could say, well would anybody could buy those boots? Yeah, but everybody, all three of those guys like the black hats on. You're watching a puppet show. I mean you're watching a puppet show now. Now you're watching them act. This is, these guys are acting like they're bad guys now. Like it's like a show. Like cops are arresting cops, they're arresting cops and then it gives them the power to go in and arrest everybody else. Cause now we obviously have a violent protest so we escalate. So instead of it being what it really is, it becomes a show.

Speaker 5:          01:44:40       There's a video of one of them like kicking a window in and a, it's like a real tight video. If you watch it from like the media side, but there's actually someone recording it with a phone really far away and when you look at their angle, you can see not only like all the media surrounding him, not stopping him, but there's police across the corner or like across the street just standing there like letting him bash the window in and it was just right.

Speaker 6:          01:45:00       It's perfect. It feeds into the police line. Like, I mean they love the black bloc shit like a NATO and Ga. Like there were people running around like, like someone like lit a cop crown fire, and they were just, the cops didn't do anything about it. It just gives them justification to just do mass arrests and use crowd control methods that are completely unjustified.

Speaker 3:          01:45:16       Yeah, and for people who think that that's horseshit, you just need to watch. There's a, there's a documentary, I mean it's an Alex Jones documentary, which ones settle in, but it's a nine 11, the road to tyranny. And what, what, what's in it that's the most spectacular is that he details and outlines the, the introduction of these agent provocateurs into this peaceful, um, a settlement or this peaceful a disagreement. So these people are all protesting everyone. There's no rocks thrown, nothing's happening. And then all of a sudden these dudes come in and they're dressed in black and they have military boots on and they started breaking windows and turning cars over and going crazy. And then they all hold up in a fucking building, something. I, I don't even want to get into it and full depth cause it's a long and drawn out thing, but he details it with news accounts.

Speaker 3:          01:46:02       He's showing you the actual footage of what's going on. He, and it's, it's preposterous. Like you look at it and then what happens after it will act after the police came in and broke up the peaceful protest and, and, and it turned into violence. And then the arrest, all the, uh, the fake cops or the fake fake protestors, then they make a no protest zone. So you can't even have, it was the World Trade Organization. You couldn't even have people that had a badge on with a red stripe through the WTO. They were stopping them from going to work. These people had book bags with WTO on it and they're like, this is a no protest zone. A fucking no protests on. Like, you can't go. And this is all, I mean, it's not, there's the, the narrative aside, it's, you know, this is all documented. It's all very clear.

Speaker 3:          01:46:43       It shows you the car, the car, you see the cop tell her to take the fucking pin off of her book bag. And like what HR three 47. Yeah. Well, it's also, you know, I mean, when they get really nutty, it's when they start talking about Timothy Mcveigh in Oklahoma City and how many antiterrorism provisions were passed right after Oklahoma City. All these different things that they could do after that was passed in order to surveil into, do you so what used to be illegal surveillance and that building, you know, that's that whole thing is crazy. That Timothy Mcveigh thing, if you talk to people that are demolitions experts, they said there's no way a truck filled with fertilizer can make an explosion like that. It's not what it does. I said, it doesn't have that kind of an impact. Does it mean they can, you can kill people with it, no doubt about it, but it's not going to blow the whole fucking building apart like that.

Speaker 3:          01:47:30       That's an insane bomb and probably not even just one bomb and it blew everything outward. Like if you look at them, the point of impact, the guy parks his truck right in the front of the building and then blows it up, right? That's, that's what we're supposed to believe. Well, the fucking buildings blown outward. Like there's most of the buildings missing. Like the whole front of the building's gone and fertilizer in a fucking truck can do that. He was supposed to have as this fertilizer. Yeah, but, but no, because the FBI, they have the news footage of the Spi taking bombs that didn't explode and removing them from the building. They had a bomb squad that removed additional bombs from the building because in the moments after September or after Oklahoma City, there was a lot of confusion as to what happened before they put the narrative out there and before they say that this is what happened, this is the guy. And there was a lot of confusion as to what really took place. And while that confusion is being taken by sis, news reports of FBI guys, we're moving bombs from the building and those were never like tied to him in the trial or anything like that. Now there is also very important now the second guy who was in the car the whole time, like just another, yeah. And not only that, the, um, the, the, the, the agents who were in that building all evacuated the building before the bomb went off.

Speaker 4:          01:48:35       Yeah. This is pre internet media, right? So of course when you put out the official narrative, it fills in the gaps in people's minds. Yeah. It's like a, you ask, uh, an acquaintance, what'd you think of the hot girl wearing the red hat? We just pass by. Most people go, yeah, she was hot. Even if that girl did not exist, right? You fill in the blanks and especially after something traumatic happens, you want somebody out there with the voice of authority to say, this is what happened. Now you know, now it's not a fucking mystery. We can move on with our lives. And you pretty much accept whatever they say.

Speaker 3:          01:49:04       Yeah, no doubt. No doubt about it. I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, we live in a shocking world and if something like operation Northwoods is possible, that one point in time they had decided they were going to sacrifice American lives. And then you hear about the Dick Cheney plan to do this. The very same thing in Iran at the end of the Bush administration. You, you got to wonder what we're, what we don't know about

Speaker 4:          01:49:25       what about General Wesley Clark's coming out and I think it was 2007 where he said that he was given that paper, uh, classified memos saying that they wanted to invade seven countries in five years. And this was all laid out. Yeah. This is like a week after nine or something like here it is. What did it say? What the other countries where, cause I'm sure can pull it up online.

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       Do you want to pull it up on mine suite here? Wesley Clark Sad. Brian one. Find that because it's, if you want us, the last piece of hope and in between that and just agent provocateurs, there's been a lot of uh, uh, agents like going in and using like entrapment techniques to like get people arrested. Well, of course, not only that, they've actually supplied them with, they could have never had in the first place something like 18 year old kid who's just like, you know, he can be taught, I mean, so like vulnerable and can be talking about all FBI facilitation. They could not do what they are saying that they can do without the FBI completely controlling and manufacturing the way just providing him with it. It's like talking them into doing well by the way, introducing that idea into their head. I mean, right. When you have a person and that person benefits from getting you to do something that is illegal and they benefit by getting a collar, they'd benefit and you didn't, you didn't have this plan in effect until you came into contact with them.

Speaker 1:          01:50:43       How could that possibly be legal? Because you're just counting the possibility that that could be influencing, first of all, what kind of a deceptive person are they that they can pretend they're so good, they can trick you and B, they could pretend that they're on your side when meanwhile they're the enemy. I mean, if you're, if you're a terrorist and the FBI is in, in the myths and pretending to be one of you, he's such a good manipulator that he can pretend to be you. I mean, this guy's an excellent bullshitter. And then on top of that, he comes up with a plan. Listen man, we're going to stick it to the man and you're like, Hey, what are we going to do? I want to get you some c four who had to blow this motherfucker. You're like, are you sure about that? And you're like, oh yeah, I got it covered.

Speaker 1:          01:51:21       Let me just do everything. That guy that got arrested in Dallas, that kid was a fucking moron. I mean, he was a dumb kid and they talked to him in to making this attack. They, they gave him a fake bomb and they let him try to detonate it. They tell them everything to do. They did and they failed this kid up with hypnosis. I mean, I'm not discounting the fact that he, you know, anybody that is willing to just detonate this fake bomb, it should be removed anyway. I mean they did an awesome service cause they got a fucking moron off the street. And if it wasn't the FBI that talk this kid in a doing that, it could have been actual terrorist is a moron. That guy's that guys, I'm glad I didn't run into him at the supermarket. Some extent you need people like that who are infiltrating groups just to get rid of the supermarket.

Speaker 1:          01:52:04       Uh, I think we've seen evidence of it going away too far where they are the problem. Like well how about the one in Florida where they're hiring undercover cops to pretend to be high school students to get weed getting stronger and, and laws. And this is something that we could actually fix. Well how about the one where there's a 25 year old woman who convinces a 17 year old honor roll student and get her weed? Some horn tries to give it to her as a gift and she insisted he take money for it and then he's arrested because she's so horny. Little, no nothing kid. And he gets fucking locked away. It's insane. It's insane. But yet this is all done with tax dollars. You know, we're, we're paying for them to entrap 17 year olds with boners the bed. The best story of entrapment

Speaker 7:          01:52:46       that was hardcore failure was this guy. And then they get paid like hundreds of thousands of dollars do this over the course of six months to a year. I mean really longterm shit. And so this guy was in a mosque trying to rally up like some terrorist activity and they actually reported hinder the FBI there like some crazy motherfucker isn't here trying to like talk to him. We got this one

Speaker 8:          01:53:07       so silly. It's so awkward. Surveillance. Well the Da, if the fact that they can go, they have the time to go after pot when there's math, it's like did you clean up all the math? You didn't clean up the mess because the pots recently, some kid wrote like fuck the DEA on his Facebook page and now he's being charged with a felony or something saying, well I apparently threatened me. You just said, you know, said something fucked up. There's three words. It's not the most eloquent, eloquent way to argue against the agency's policies. But if that's what puts you in prison, like learning the word well, agencies are a problem. It's a problem. When you boil things down to three letters, when you have power, because of those three letters you say open up, it's the FBI. Like Holy Shit, the FBI's here. It's not like no knock knock.

Speaker 8:          01:53:50       Who is it? Well, my name is Mike and on the machine guns is Peter and Tom and behind them is a delivery with a battering Ram and Bob's his backup and a, well we're here because we heard that you uh, you have some plants or something. I mean that doesn't sound right, but open up. It's the DEA like Holy Shit, the DEA is here. Like whenever you have people like that in a group and you give them like a little name like that, it just puts some mythical fucking no. Yeah. It's like, it's like it's a giant power group. Pick them off stealing goods. What's tragic about that is like you said, the math is still out there. Like these agencies have an actual role. And instead they focused on the wrong shit. Like it'd be great to get meth out of people's hands because it destroys lives.

Speaker 8:          01:54:33       The great if you've got an Oxycontin, so it'd be great if the FBI focused on the tremendous amount of financial fraud happening right now. Like half the emails and my fucking spam folder or people directly trying to defraud me out of money in some way. That's just amazing. Nigerians, I know a lot of us, a lot of that spans so many, so many people. I don't fall for that shit, but my point is a lot of people out there in America do, especially older people who don't use the internet as much. Yeah. That should be looked into. And the people who directly benefited from the financial crisis that should be looked into. It's not, instead they're focused on fucking occupiers and journalists. Well, the problem is it's compartmentalize too. It's like how many people do they have that are on the police force and whatever Florida town that was there supposed to be gathering up, we'd, you know, I mean how many, how many people did they have that are supposed to get arrest?

Speaker 8:          01:55:17       Like, it's not like those people can instead be allocated, you know, in some sort of a positive way. Like you'd have to like change their job because if their job is to go out and bust people for drugs, well that's their job and they're going to do it as long as that job exists. And if that job doesn't exist, well then they're out of work and they got to find something new to do. So they're going to resist that job being being taken away as well. So it's, it's, it gets to be a weird thing of entanglement where we have private prisons, we have, you know, cops

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       and, and, and police officers, unions that are lobbying to keep certain things illegal. We have a big entanglement.

Speaker 6:          01:55:49       Yeah, no, yeah. Also, banks are laundry and trillions of dollars with the drug money. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:55:54       Oh yeah. What was that a Wacovia? It's like 400 400 something million dollars, which is so stupid. Make the shit legal, make everything legal, stop being silly. You know? Let, let people make their own fucking choices. And if you want to do math, you're going to get in any way you're going to get math and you know, we should fucking heavily punished any company that wants to sell it to the point where it's not even financially viable. Take that money. If you're going, you really sell math, you're fucking touch a piece of shit. I mean, it's not like the data's not in, it's not like there's meth advocates out there going, dude, my life was terrible. So I started smoking the nap and it's like, I just saw it different. I was like, I didn't need to be kinder to people. That doesn't happen. There's no math advocate.

Speaker 1:          01:56:33       So if you're selling meth, you're a piece of shit as far as society is concerned and we should tax you heavily. Yeah. You maybe make a living off of it and maybe feed some Cretins, you know? But people should be responsible for their actions when they're on drugs. That's when they commit crimes. It's not the fact that you're on drugs. If you want to do math and lock yourself in the basement and just fucking hulk out and smashing into walls and shit. I don't know what I'm saying. But if you don't do anything to people, who the fuck is anybody to tell you you can't do that? And how do we have a free society if you can be told what plants you can put into your own body, it's not only that they can shoot you because there's a 17 year old kids are getting like their chances for getting into college or like ruined forever cause I got caught with a joint. You know they don't think of that school they need the internet. School's going to be awesome to get laid, but that's where the harmony comes in. Just need to get on you harm

Speaker 6:          01:57:20       and just put together a day date, a dope profile and you know really like come up with some good quotes. Sort about craigslist is the verdict. Well if you want to hook her, that's what she needs to go or a couch or out. Then the media narrative, like just immediately putting it out into the mainstream to try to solidify some sort of narrative or right after nine 11 my mom was like, uh, Uber Patriotic, you know the flag phone case, fucking first bag out on the block and shit and stuff. My brother and I just discovered this giant box of magazines and newspapers right after nine 11 and you should see it. I mean Newsweek, Time magazine, like two days after nine 11 already explaining exactly. You know, everything laid out, all the hijackers bin Ladin the how the buildings fell down and all the countries that going to invade in the next 10 years. And you're like, if you had this much information and they had to have been fed it just directly by the government, I'm like, then how come they couldn't prevent it if they'd already knew all the shit within 24 hours to print this publication? Right.

Speaker 1:          01:58:13       You have the mind that the nine 11 events were orchestrated or it's incompetent

Speaker 6:          01:58:18       I think in part orchestrated for sure. That's undeniable. I mean just the put options alone shows that, well that's, that could just say for knowledge the put options where all of the, I mean, you bet for stocks to fail on any given day. A lot of people bet for certain stocks and fail. But on this particular day, all the airlines that were involved in nine 11, we're bet 25 times more that they would fail. So all these rich white people pretty much profited immensely. So someone's failed stocks. Someone had to be tipped off and then, and then they didn't pursue it because they said, well, because it wasn't done by Al Qaeda, then we're not interested in pursuing the money ring in your like. But that's much more interesting that it was done by old white men that bet for these stocks to fail. That's much more fascinating to me. Do we know if there's a list somewhere of people who benefited? I don't know. But also people were warned not to fly Willie Brown. Uh, some other people will have admitted that they were told not to fly. So, I mean there, there definitely was for knowledge, but if you're going into nine 11, I mean the hijack, some of the hijackers lived with the old mayor. Yeah. Um, two of the hijackers lived at Pensacola naval base with under the roof of an FBI informant. I mean that's, that's documented. That's mainstream

Speaker 3:          01:59:24       news. So do you think that they set the whole thing up and do you think they were real hijackers and how'd they get people to suicide? Bombed?

Speaker 6:          01:59:34       They were patsy. They don't think that they knew that they were going to die. I don't know. I mean, I don't want to speculate. All I know is what I'm being told is a lie.

Speaker 3:          01:59:43       How much have you looked into the, uh, the flying aspect? Alas, the flying aspect is fascinating when you talk to people that actually fly those jets and talk about how difficult it is to maneuver them correctly, especially the one where it hits the Pentagon. That's fucking fascinating. And there's no pieces of planes and we'll not only that, that area where it hits is the same area where Donald Rumsfeld was on television just a day before talking about this trillion plus dollars. It's missing some, some dangerous amount of money that's missing. And then the accounting office in the Pentagon shut down is what gets hit by this plane. I mean, that's where the plane lands. It's the very offices that we're storing all the data that we're looking for, where the mothers in construction in that side of the building,

Speaker 6:          02:00:33       I think at, at the very least, they knew exactly what was coming and they helped make it happen at the very fucking lease, which should piss people off just as fucking match. Because think about it, if they knew that this terrorist attack was coming, so they tell people in the first World Trade Center, whatever the, the, you know, after the first ones hit, they knew that it was the terrorist attack that they had been warned about. And then they told people to go to fucking back to work in the Second World Trade Center

Speaker 5:          02:00:57       hang. It piqued my interest when I was here. A lot of thing like theories about that was the building seven. Yeah. That was like the videos of that or just it? It looks exactly like if you put it right next to a video of of an an intentionally imploded building. Like it just looks exactly the same.

Speaker 3:          02:01:13       Yeah. The, the tower seven, this mind fuck of a half because the real thing about tower seven as if it was a controlled demolition. What did they build it that way? Did they build it so they could just implode it and if they didn't, how long did it take to rig that? Cause you talked to people that like demolish buildings. That's you. It takes a long time. And if it didn't, if it wasn't a demolition, why would you not sue like crazy. If that was my building and it just fell apart like that

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       and I'd be like, bitch, how'd you build this? Is Larry Silverstein confident? He has like 20 mil dude off

Speaker 4:          02:01:45       off the whole complex roofers. Yeah. Guys. The truth. I find it so scary that that's the word that's been pushed out there. Now it's being pushed on totally different topics that have nothing to do with nine 11 like it's kind of where William, that a truth or is now a piece of shit like somebody who's interested in pursuing what the truth was about nine 11 that's like truth or the one patriotic cruisers and it's like a funny being a truth. It's almost like straight out of 1984 these fucking unpatriotic true thirst. They want the truth. Well, how about being a liberal? Yeah, I, I've been called libertarian like it's an insult before, which I'm not even a libertarian. I have some of their views, but it's like you really, you hate people who want to have more personal freedoms and liberties. That's a bad thing. Why is that a bad thing? It's, it's weird. It's crazy. We're, we're nuts. Oh, you one of those love

Speaker 1:          02:02:33       fucking up his world. What are you a friend, your friend going to be my friend. Found out my friend. Fuck face. I don't want friends from American. Well. Also, another interesting thing about the nine 11 thing is that if we, the s there was a CIA sting operation to get the Bin Ladin Confession tape, quote Unquote Confession tape that's admitted by the Guardian, like that was set up by the CIA to get him to supposedly confessed. So if we had him, why didn't we just arrest him then? That was in 2001 well, what do you think about this guy who wrote the book and the, the Navy seal wrote the book on the assassination of Bin Ladin and he's given a totally different version of the events than the official story. How does that guy, you're allowed to make that book. How can we have an ice dam?

Speaker 4:          02:03:15       I don't, I don't know if I believe cause I mean I'm not sure. I think they realize that the public knows that, um, you know, they're, the official story is never exactly correct,

Speaker 1:          02:03:24       but you're allowed to say this. What was the last time a guy was involved in like a secret operation? Wrote a book about it. It doesn't make any sense. Yeah. It's almost like you're, they give him the green. I don't under they give him the green light. Did they tell him, listen man, you want to do help? You crunchy. I like to write a book about the events. Just mix it up a little. It looks like we're like not telling the full truth and we're like, bring it back. Don't say anything. When in season five we bring back the sound wasn't really Osama, it was this other dude that looks like Osama because he's in love with Osama, you know he wants to be Osama but he's not. So they shot him in the heads of it even know so they thought they got Osama.

Speaker 1:          02:04:06       They really did think that got him. We've been holding back on the DNA. We've had the DNA. We've kept it secret because they didn't want to alarm people still out there. He was on the island. I love that you NGA, when [inaudible] speaks every year, everyone like walks out, but he's actually said some really same shit. He's just like, how come you guys just dump and laudens body in the ocean? Like, how come you didn't just arrest him and put him on trial? They can, everyone's like walking out like, because he like the real life version of the dictator, like a document. But it gives the UN speech there and people are like, no. Most people that are in the intelligence community said that, that he was already dead. They said been a lot of that had been dead for years. Our butoh came out and Pakistani prime minister, he for, she was assassinated, can't you said to see attended his funeral to ease those Grice.

Speaker 1:          02:04:52       She said she attended his funeral. Hmm. This bitch. Cause we get problematic. Pesky truth. Predator, pesky traffic or ground. Never say it. Common like Predator and like a second, a third vote. I don't even think they vote on it. This thing about all this is that no one demands evidence or no one demands facts from the government. So that's just appeal to authority. You're just like, well, let's just trust our government must be true. It's not no one because there's people like you right now, there's a whole wave of kids that are growing up that are um, people growing up with real transparency as far as what's going on. You know, and even if you want to insulate yourself Salou give yourselves a pat on the back of your, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:05:38       It's fucking nasty. Horrible started. Sorry Dave Asprey. I didn't have time to make the bulletproof coffee that I use. I can't believe it's not butter. It's not the same point. Nice coffee. No, you just pour it in there. We had this guy on yesterday who makes a, he's a fucking super cool dude and just incredibly fascinating guy. And one of the things he was saying was that we have in an amazing amount of toxins that we just accept because there's so much corn in our diets and like some, some insane number of percentage of corn has like certain low level toxic fungus on it. Totally edible. I pissed off how you drink a lot of water that's actually healthy, but that, that you know, you should really have only grass fed beef and only grass fed beef butter. And that coffee off oftentimes comes with a fungus on it as well.

Speaker 1:          02:06:26       And there's toxic funguses and a lot of people's coffee and that. They're literally, that's why they get, they feel like shit after they drink coffee. Literally you're getting poisoned. It's not this club, this is all organic. We'd go, we'd go to a nice place. It's down the street. It's very nice people. Um, but that, um, he makes his bulletproof coffee so he takes his butter and MCT oil. Mct Oil is, you take coconut oil and he's sticking in a centrifuge and take the best part of it, the most nutritious part. And then he puts it, separates it and makes an oil, puts that in the coffee butter. That's from a only grass fed cows. Cause apparently the, the um, the fats in that are much more healthy for your body. And he mixes it all together in a blender with his coffee and he just sits back and shot himself in the head. Fucking guy was a trip, man, that guy, there's very few people that really freaked me out. This guy freaked me out. What was the whole point of drinking that that's sensational for your body? All the, uh, the, the fatty acids, all the, the, uh, the oils, the healthy oils from the MCT oil and from the grass fed butter. So sensational for brain function. You're, you just feel like you're on fire. It's like really great stuff and get it doesn't like burn you out as easy because I don't understand. He explained how it's uh,

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       how they interact with each other and how, how positive it is for your, uh, for your brain. But he had a, all these crazy things that he did and one of them was go to this place that, that thing with the sound where you manipulate sound with your mind. You're set up with electrodes and you literally manipulate sounds with thought and in, in, in, in which your mind and brainwaves and you're in an isolated place where it's total blackness and you're doing this and apparently it's been shown to rewire your brain and the more control over you have over the sound. It's like power lifting for your brain and you come out of it with a permanent boost in your Iq. He boosted his Iq 20 points from this seven day, every day, all day experience of this Guy Magneto. Sounds like maybe that's what I'm talking about.

Speaker 3:          02:08:20       Fuck out. And you walk in there. Well listen, the guy was smart as fuck. He wasn't fake smart as fuck. So I, I had to like listen to everything he said. And I know that research and science backs almost every single different aspect of that. The health part of his bulletproof diet that he's talking about. I read all the stuff. I mean it's, it's all, it seems like it seems rock solid. So this guy is like this super genius character who is claiming that 20% or rather a 20 points of his Iq was boosted by doing this fucking crazy sound experiment and the dark for seven days. He scared the shit out of me. Where did he claim where, where do you do this? BC. That's where he lives. He lives up in BC. And he did he sent this up or is it like a research project someone was doing or oh no, well it's, it's, you know, I don't, I don't remember entirely, but it's based on the research of some neuroscientists to figure it out.

Speaker 3:          02:09:09       Something about manipulating brainwaves with electricity and stimulation. So he puts these little electrodes on his head and he sends like a low volt to change his, uh, his state, you know, from Alpha to Beta or whatever the fuck it is. You know, he's got like, you know, like different settings on it and I put it on pinched. I said that it felt like a, like a a B was just touching you at the tip of his horn is a little stinger, just not stinging you but just say [inaudible] could just fuck you up right now dude, but not quite. And so this guy is obsessed with, with like manipulating his mind and like hacking his body. So he takes in all of these incredible amounts of essential nutrients and he's eating like the healthiest grass fed meat and he's fucking electrifying his brain and he's going to his place in manipulating things with sound and getting smarter, like notably visibly smarter.

Speaker 3:          02:09:58       And I know he's smart as fuck. He can't fake it for two hours. There's a certain amount of talking to someone. We can tell if someone's we like, I've had people on the podcast before that I knew were full of Shit within like the first 20 minutes talking to them. But the first 15 minutes I might've thought they were pretty cool. And then somewhere along the line to go, there's this guy's a little wacky, there's something, something, something wrong here. There's some, this guy was not like that. This guy was just firing off all this fucking information about how to streamline your, your, your mind and how to make things work better and what nutrients are essential and what they do and how it literally, it enhances the way your nerve endings, your nerve endings

Speaker 1:          02:10:33       interact. He eats Yak. Yak was delicious. It was delicious, but they only eat a certain type of a plant and you can't even grow it at low altitudes so they don't like live down here. It's like tough to get a Yak, Yak in your backyard because you grow Yak food. It just fucking just dies. Idiot to who? Collect exotic pets. I was just, we were just talking about it outside all the idiot too. I would like python, fucking chimpanzees and Kangaroos and there's like beauty pageants for exotic animals. Didn't know what a chimpanzee was until that one eight that lady's face. People thought the chimpanzees were like Bj and the bear, you know, like to see your buddy. He goes trucking with you. You know, like they were always sidekicks and movies and shit. Like, people didn't see the videos of chimps eating monkeys alive.

Speaker 1:          02:11:19       You know, they've never seen a champ attack a person they didn't know about these chimps in Africa right now that are going to, that forget one particular part or Africa where they're actually going actively out of their way to kill humans and they've killed, uh, you know, I've got to pull that up because that sounds like terrorism. I think we should go and start a war. That's exactly what we're doing to them. So that's a shock to they're doing it back. Well, the row there, um, there were reacting. It's in a Congo, the eat them like crazy in the Congo. It's called Bushmeat. The lions in Africa that were intentionally hunting humans and like keeping their bones in a cave or oh yeah. That was the ghost and the darkness. That's pretty big. Back when val Kilmer was sexy and slim for Batman. Yeah, back man.

Speaker 1:          02:12:02       I just fucking tapped out. And it's like, yeah, imagine that this thing, Congo chimps reporting and killing people. Imagine that thing. And here's the thing is they go right for your fingers first. That's what they like to rip apart first. Cause they know you can't fight back when you don't have fingers. So they immediately go after your fingers, like grabbed your hand and eat your fucking fingers and you can't stop them. You can't stop them. They're way stronger than you. They have your hand, they're just going to chew your fucking fingers off. And then they go after your Dick. They go off to your Dick, they rip your Dick off, they kill your sexually, and then they go after your face. They pull your eyes out like they're smart. They know they're not even killing you. They kill you easy. They could pick up a rock and just start smashing you and you'd be dead.

Speaker 1:          02:12:42       But they're punishing you. They are punishing, punishing you by taking away your, your humanness, taking one of your ability to see things, your sex organs. I mean, it's crazy. They take your feet apart. They attack people's feet. Yeah. And they're smart. You know, they can spell, you know, they shouldn't be in cages. I mean there's, there's, there's no way there should be a healthy separation between people and these fucking things in the real world because they do that to each other. They go after other chimps and they fucked him up. I mean, it's amazing that they're just now starting to gang up on people. But 10 people have been killed. 17 people have been severely injured and uh, they, they killed one little kid. They don't give a fuck. Why would they not kill a kid? They don't like people that don't like people. They don't like to say, well it's only been like six. I just want to let them, they think this is an easy kill. Yeah. It's just scary shit man. I was listening to one of your, where you're talking to

Speaker 8:          02:13:32       a guy who came back from China, is it, they love to eat and monkeys and certain parts of China. So it's really not that much different from what we do in terms of other cultures of humans. Like I think it's appalling that somebody would hunt down a monkey and fucking eat it. Just not even cause you need the meat. But just for pleasure because it's considered like a high status thing to have monkey on the table, you know? That is weird. More fucked up to do that or more fucked up to have drones that shoot rockets into buildings and you know you're going to get like 98% I think drones are, drones are a little more fucked up. Yeah. What is the percentage is 2% versus 98% fuck up, right? Many percent accidental murder. That's what we're getting for all those buildings to fight terror.

Speaker 8:          02:14:12       That's the only way. That's the only way I'm going to bust some myths. That right there isn't it? So you have these two combating narratives with like the liberal and conservative establishment where you're like, we either have to have full fledged warfare or we have drone wars, but no one's questioning do we need, maybe we don't need any. I'm showing you to be fucking fighting this proverbial enemy that doesn't really, it's not a very central way cooler we can do with that technology. Yeah. Well we can, the amount of money we spent in Iraq and Afghanistan would have funded like a little over 400 missions. Uh, the same size and significance is the curiosity mission to Mars. I did the math on that and uh, I get the math. Well that was the Neil degrasse Tyson isn't that fucking psycho though. Like the money that we spent in Iraq and Afghanistan, which the average American citizen is received zero benefit from, we could have launched 400 missions around the solar system and it killed a million people aside from the Shit we learned from doing all that.

Speaker 8:          02:15:02       It's the jobs that we would, we would create right here in the u s cause you don't outsource NASA jobs to China. They stay here in the u s it's crazy. Yeah. It's, it's interesting that this, this industry is thought of as like by the people that are in charge I guess as the only way of having this amount of business going on. It's like that's the only way. Instead of thinking of taking the same sort of initiative at the same amount of focus and resources and putting it on just building up inner cities, just fixing Detroit. You know, if you've seen the signs and Detroit, now they're saying enter Detroit at your own risk. It's like they're posting siren sang in terrible places saying people should enter it. Their own risk. It's like saying like, I guess cops aren't going to go in there. Like the murder rate in Detroit is through the roof.

Speaker 8:          02:15:42       It's the scariest place in the country. Right. In the city council there was telling people not to come like, yeah, I, which is like weird cause you, you know crazy. It's good for their economy to have people come in and it's for them to say that it's gotta be really serious. Yeah. The fact that we're over in Afghanistan and we're not in Detroit. I was crazy, awesome campaigns looking at the cops don't want to go into Detroit. You should look, there's no way a country can be strong when the base of it, the bottom of it is fucked up and rotten and the bottom of this country, the foundation of this country is youth and poor neighborhoods. Though the higher we can make the quality of life for our poor people, the better the whole thing works. The more accessible like happiness and wealth is to poor people, the more it's possible to, to, to gain and achieve and to get out of there. The,

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       the, the stronger. The whole thing gets like the idea that we have this finite amount of jobs. No, we just have a finite amount of jobs with this system, with this system, but there's obviously a lot of work to be done. There's a shit load of things that need to get done and not everybody's going to get to be Tom Cruise, but a lot of people do a lot of really good fucking things that it is possible that we could use the same resources, the same billions of dollars that we're allocating to going over places that we don't really understand for whatever fucking reason. You know, it's not the truth. We could do that over here. It doesn't seem to be impossible. It just doesn't seem to be probable under this situation. And this, the group that's in charge right now has such a stranglehold that they don't want to ever make. You think that it's possible to do things any differently. Like we're always going to be at war with Iran. We're never going to totally trust Russia. China is always dangerous. We don't know what they're really saying. I think China really is dangerous though, just my opinion. But yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:17:18       I think based on what I've seen, they have no respect for human rights. No. And uh, they're growing at such a rate that they have to keep their middleclass happy and that's not going to happen forever. I mean, already it's started seeing signs of a slow down, like a credit crunch and a slow down. You're going to get desperate. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          02:17:33       I mean, there's only so many resources in the world and so much wealth and they need more of it to keep their middle class from attacking them basically. Have they had a policy of, of attacking other countries in the past. Have they worked on that? A billion people and they want more and more and they try to do things to stop people from not saying day like just the Chinese. I'm saying you get any country with a billion people that has just recently come online and the capitalism game we're having more shit is what you want to do. They're going to start to acquire other areas. Doesn't India have a billion too? They do. They just make Bollywood. They just make movies and they don't eat cows. They don't, they're not threatening anybody other than the Pakistan though. Right.

Speaker 4:          02:18:13       It's also hilarious about hearing how Iran, when they get their nuclear weapon or whatever, that people are fearmongering us about. Um, they're like, they're going to start a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, but they don't talk about Israel. Pakistan, fucking, I mean, so many countries that have nuclear stockpile. Funny. Like Pakistan is sort of, it was sort of a u s backed country. There's a lot of us money going in there over the last 60 years. And India was sort of had the same thing going on with Russia and you know, Usr Ussr collapsed and yet India is a new emerging country and Pakistan is doing so shitty.

Speaker 1:          02:18:49       It's hilarious that we pay attention to them like they're really dangerous. Well we don't fuck with North Korea. North Korea is scary there. They are really brainwashed. It's a nutty fucking country full of people that will drop bombs. It's depressing to the human costs. They're like, those people are 100% brainwashed. Yeah. They brought, they brought in an eye doctor, uh, to fix some of the people's eyes

Speaker 4:          02:19:09       cause they had cataracts do whatever they do for cataracts and chopped that part out and replace it. And they did this, they actually brought in a film crew and this was like the cover story. They had to bring them into the countries that are just filming the medical procedures and it's scary. They, they would get their vision back instead of back to the d instead of thanking the doctor like you dear leader for bringing

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       us our vision back. And it's like, no, he didn't bring your vision back. He's the reason why you have fucking cataracts in the first place because you working in a factory your whole life, like dark lighting and chemicals being sprayed in your face. Did you see all the people that were crying in the street when he died and that people who weren't crying, where actually there were locked in jail for six months and punished and they lost jobs and like they have concentration camps. I mean, you'd go there to work and die. Yeah, but they don't have resources, so fuck them. You know, if they had oil, we would have an awesome movie about going to war with North Korea. It's already know it would be the big deal. Yeah. But there's nothing there for us. It's not worth it. It's not in there. I saw some stats on Twitter.

Speaker 1:          02:20:05       It was like, uh, can somebody please tell congress that there's no oil on the Internet tweeted that? That's hilarious. So the, you know, the only hope that I have for any of this stuff actually turning around is I think the people that have been in power for a long time. We got to keep eternal life from them. We've got to make sure that they don't actually get some sort of technology where they could live forever because then I'll never, it's like there's so much power in that position. There's so much power in the position of being in charge of the military industrial complex being in charge of, you know, where the money gets allocated, being in charge of the influence of presidents that, that, that to get to that position. I mean that is a, an immense point of power and it's really hard to wrench power when someone has that and it's even harder to get them to give it up because it's not moral.

Speaker 1:          02:20:59       And that seems to be the only way you're ever really going to change things is they have to leave. They have to die off. And people like yourself, young people that want to get involved in politics, have to move into these previously corrupt roles and announced new standards. They have to move in and announce a new way of looking at things that people thought we were getting with Obama. That's what we were happy about. We thought we were getting out of this same fucking scary shit that we had with this, this corporate monster, Dick Cheney pulling the strings of this dumb dumb from Texas. And we were terrified and we were like, this guy does not represent us, but that guy does look at him. He's half black. It's a single mom. He said came from single mom, used to smoke weed, get 'em in all my God, it's going to be the shit.

Speaker 1:          02:21:44       Meanwhile recruited Taz already taken over and I think that uh, it's just a matter of understanding that and undermining the whole system. We can't just wait for people to take over these positions and then change it from the top down. That could never have got to fight. You gotta fight both parties. You can't just go after one or the other. Put it in the system is broken. Yeah. There's no system that says no dude parties. I mean, shit, it's all completely shows like this are helping. Like it's not just the system we need to fix. It's also people need to become aware. There are a lot of people don't even know this shit is happening right now. They think that they still have a government that kind of represents them. By the way, this is good for the government too because unchecked power is bad for you too. You don't want to be in that position. You should be checked. You should. There should be regulations. It should be there should be sale, but should be

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       safeguards in place to protect you from human nature. It should be very clean and very clear and since we're moving into this age of more access to information than ever before, it should be easier to check you than ever before. You should be more noble. You should be more just, it should be more fair. It shouldn't be the opposite. Shouldn't be more surveillance, more storing of your fucking phone calls without warrants more. Whatever the crazy shit they're doing now. It shouldn't be that. That's a sign of a sickness. That's a sign of you trying to hang on to your addiction while you're trying to do is isolate everybody and get them away from you. You're trying to force yourself into a position where you can control the situation because you don't want to accept the fact that you're living in uninvolved life and the people that are in charge of whatever the fuck it is, call it whatever you want, whatever it is that's moving us into war, whatever it is that's sucking oil out of the ground and the way you get it is by Jack and countries and holding onto the resources, whatever the fuck that is, they have to come to some sort of a realization that this is an insane way to live.

Speaker 8:          02:23:28       Yeah, it's the, it's the resistance to change. It's the resistance inevitability that they do not want to accepts, that they're trying very hard to maintain us into this, uh, ideological

Speaker 3:          02:23:38       controlling. Great. They fear this connection so badly. They fear this, that it's coming down and that's why they're trying to lock everything up. And that's why they're trying to set up these safe guards in place where basically everything is legal. They can just arrest you that you don't have to have a lawyer. No, there's, we have, you know, article six, paragraph five. We can go from fuck you with hammers if we want to

Speaker 5:          02:23:57       talking about that. The thing that amber was talking about at lunch with the, uh, the new, uh, the new NDA bill. Oh, that's scary. I was talking to you right before we started about this, the 2013 Nda with them. Well, there's a law right now that basically says like the, the, the, the government can't turn propaganda against American citizens, so they're not allowed to like have all that, you know, war propaganda posters and stuff like that. For some reason people in Congress have decided that they want to undo that and it's going to be kind of another writer in the same way that indefinite detention was on the 2012 Nda and what we were like, we were just kind of theorizing it launched. One of the ways that they could use that is by using government funding to hire people to basically sit on Twitter. All right.

Speaker 8:          02:24:42       That's what they already do. Well, I mean, they already do it. I mean, of course like when they were already indefinitely detaining people before they'll have the green light, the league, right light and the resources. So as time goes on and shit gets more and more crazy, they can just do anything they want and it will all be legal. So they've essentially made being a dictator league that we can destroy social media in the same way they destroyed mainstream media. Instead of having like war

Speaker 5:          02:25:04       there's on the wall, what they'd have is like banks of people sitting on Twitter all day, like in for instance, like going after Abby for like something she says on her show and pretending not, it's, they're not going to be labeled as like a government Twitter account. They're going to be like

Speaker 8:          02:25:15       pretending. They're never going to have the amount of enthusiasm zoom

Speaker 3:          02:25:19       that the people fighting them are because they're just going to be shitty government employees that don't have that in mind as what they want to be doing with their lives. Whereas people that are fighting it, they're led by a vision. They're led by, they have a hope and a dream for something being better. And they have, they have passion. These people, that's just their job. It's just another obstacle in the people that do things like that and just for a job, they suck at it. Like there are people on my message board that are probably government agents. They're fucking terrible at it. I know there was trying to buy weed from people laziest Deh and ever, you know, it's like it's, it's pretty obvious man. There's, there's, you know, in order to get people to be as charismatic, to be as educated on the subject, to be as, as aware of what young people are tuned into.

Speaker 3:          02:26:06       You'd have to like become one of them. You know, you'd have to, if you were working for the government and you were working and you were, you were supposed to be like an agent provocateur and you were working on the Internet with more and more access to the Internet, you're going to start looking at shinny and where the fuck am I working for? You know, and if you're a 29 year old guy or 30 year old guy, it's very possible that you would start doing some things for the opposition. It's very possible that a guy like Bradley manning did exactly that, that he's working for the government. And you realize at one point in time like holy shit, like look at someone needs to see this stuff. Like this is crazy stuff. This is nuts. We're shooting these reporters and they're joking about it. They're making it seem like it's no big deal. And they're shooting a van full of kids, you know, and to say, well it shouldn't brought kids. Like you're hearing shit like that and you know what the fuck. So this kid re releases it and now he's an enemy of the state and they give him the same brains, scrambled treatment that they're giving people.

Speaker 4:          02:26:58       Donald, my dad, he's done. I mean, you keep somebody in solitary for that long. That is torture. It's torture and Ruthie bruise your brand. You need stimulation with other human beings. You need to see other people's faces. You need that too.

Speaker 3:          02:27:09       Right. So she can never testify. He could never, he never like plead his case. Like literally they wrote

Speaker 4:          02:27:16       and definitely not attention. It has only been legal what? Less than 365 days via the NDA. But Bradley Manning's when in pretrial, pretrial detention for over 900.

Speaker 3:          02:27:26       Now, how crazy is that? Nobody's, nobody's scrambling to try to get that kid out and nobody's talking about it is part of their campaign strategy.

Speaker 4:          02:27:34       No politicians and the people are, most, a lot of people care about this, but to be honest, there are a lot of people who don't. And recently there was this huge controversy about Reddit Gawker, which, you know, Walker, it's a big gossip blog out of the identity of one of the moderators on Reddit who was behind some of their, uh, more a disgusting sections, like one section posted photos of dead girls who are under the age of 17. That was like the specific purpose of this community was to do that. And there are a lot of people online who are outraged that his identity was revealed in this article. And it was a grandfather, was he? I don't know that much about, I know he was in Texas, but, uh, they were, they were so outraged. They were so outraged about this, that they blocked Gawker from posting links on many parts of Reddit to like starve them of traffic, which gawkers popular regardless. But, uh,

Speaker 6:          02:28:22       I was seeing how fucking sick is that you're defending this scumbag when meanwhile are actual political activists who were having their anonymous anonymity stripped away from them and they're being fronted a fucking prison cells and there are hacktivists or having the same thing done to them. Like Jeremy Hammon, I think his name is, and you don't see any, you don't see any upward or on reddit or Digg about that shit because it's like people were like, there's a disconnect. You know. What about Obama prosecuted more whistle blowers in any other administration combined easily an antiquated law from world war one 1917. What's the law? The espionage act for spies during World War One. They charged Thomas Drake, some guy who was an NSA whistleblower, but an illegal torture and spine program and they fucking tried to, uh, put him in jail for 20 years for it has to be matched. Bradley manning the same thing, which could have the death penalty. I mean, that's a very serious charge. Aiding the enemy to not that hope he changes it. Yeah, it's pretty intense.

Speaker 1:          02:29:15       What do you guys see happening in the future? What do you, how do you see this playing out? Do you have any idea? Is it ridiculous to even guess, but it seems that we're building towards an event. It doesn't, it doesn't seem to me that, you know, we can continue with all these various aspects, the continual, uh, the wars overseas, the battle for resources, the crazy people that we have representing us that don't seem to have anything in line with our own personal needs or our own wants or desires as a nation. It seems like we're being led. We're on a pirate ship, we're on this crazy fucking pirate ship and we're slow. We're about to hit the rock somewhere.

Speaker 6:          02:29:51       I think, uh, I always tell people, I mean people who vote in the presidential elections and, and think that there's going to be some sort of change that can never happen. It's only coming from grassroots is only coming from the bottom up. And I think that if you, you just acknowledged that voting is something that you do every day, multiple times a day. I mean everything you do is politicize. Everything you'd do can, can have an impact. So I think the conversations you have, the dialogue you engage in as the business, as you choose to support the websites you go to, the media you consume. I mean all of that is an act of voting. All of that can enact some sort of change. And so it's just, it's just, it's easy to get disillusioned and disempowered from getting sucked into these fucking election cycles that are just psychically van pampers thick. I Dunno, it's hard

Speaker 5:          02:30:33       feel like you can have it have an effect on something like a presidential election maybe. Like a lot of people feel like it doesn't really matter if I go and vote. What the, where they can have an effect is like what people like David like on a congressional level and on in midterm elections and specifically in primaries where a lot of good, perhaps good politicians get pushed out.

Speaker 1:          02:30:55       Dude, if you can get in there and give us an inside view of what the fuck is going on with that machine, that fast fascinate, I have my Google glasses on. Just an insight to how the fucking machine runs cause it must be way more complicated than I imagine it must be. Just

Speaker 5:          02:31:11       I feel like there's a lot of, probably like a ton of pressure just coming down on you. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:31:15       Very hard. You can't get there unless you've already sucked the lizard cock. But here's, here's the thing. If

Speaker 8:          02:31:20       he was going to bring you into a room with a blizzard, fucking lizard cognitive, well, the model that we're basing this on is a little bit different from the Lizard Cock sucking model. It's improved. Uh, if we get lots of contributions from individuals, like tens of thousands of small donations from real people, you're beholden to those people. Instead of being beholden to the, like NPA or the defense lobby or any other shit or Israel, US relations lobby, you're now only beholden to the people who actually help get you into office and your constituents. And that's the way representation is supposed to work in this country. And it no longer does that. Cause most people feel powerless. Most people have never given $20 to anything in their life that is political. There are lot of people go, I don't like politics. And they didn't give money to Ron Paul.

Speaker 8:          02:32:03       They're not giving money to Gary Johnson or any of these people who if you were to give them money, it would make a huge difference. But how sad is it that that's what it takes? Well, money's been elections and politics since the dawn of time. Unfortunately we have super pacs are new and fucked up and that needs to be reversed as soon as possible. We need to clean election system and like, but there's other ways. I mean, it doesn't have to be that way. Well, it would be nice if people could vote online. It seems silly. Yeah, exactly. Thank you. No, it doesn't make any sense. If you mommy murder money's safe online, really come on the fucking billions and trillions of dollars that are moved around with ones and Zeros and they haven't hacked that. But you're saying they can hack. Well, they've already hacked your fucking voting machine, so those things aren't good either.

Speaker 8:          02:32:44       How could that be? So little transparency and these bulky boxes, like you can't see how it works. We count it. There's no backup. There's no verification. And if you've ever watched hacking democracy and then you watched die bolds change of their name after that dot. That hacking democracy, Hbo Show where they showed how those fucking machines are set up for a third party input to alter the number. You can alter the numbers. Yeah, you can change it and like by 10% or something crazy. That should be illegal, by the way. [inaudible] a corporation that's doing evil shit and you just rebrand as something else, but you retain all the same leadership in the same actual company. That'd be like Charles Manson being like, I'm going to rebrand is Chris, whatever and then like he's out of prison. Sadie becoming p diddy like who are you really ridiculous job, but that's just hanging out with reggae. Do you smoke a lot of weed? You'll think you're a cat. Also, the CEO of Diebold told Bush at a campaign event. He was just like, we, you will get in. You know the president.

Speaker 8:          02:33:45       I know I need mushrooms. They all need to be taken away. I live in DC. I am just like, I just want to dose all the politicians there and like all the CIA should be able to get into politics and I don't think like once you leave politics you should be able to go work for the corporation. Yeah. The were like Supreme Court justices that go work. Like they'll overturn a law and then they'll go join a corporation that benefits from it. Of course we'll, how about people that construct financial studies that that benefit people in Wall Street and then there, there are universities when they do this then they get out of that and they get jobs with these very firms that they've helped protect and make money from it. And you find out that they're making millions of dollars, you know, working for these corporations now are the opposite.

Speaker 8:          02:34:24       Like Halliburton and Dick Cheney obviously that was, that'd be the biggest example. The most ridiculous whenever, right. A guy who's a CEO of a company that fits his shit after it gets blown up, gets in office and then decides to blow up everything and then give them no bid contracts to fiction and they did a horrible job too. I just watched something on that the other day where they were talking about the quality of the water, like the quality of the services they were providing the soldiers but it was just ridiculous. And then you sounded like burn pits cause they had like they would like take all this, all this, all this equipment that was bought by taxpayers and it was just like chunk it away like the waste or is just phenomenal. It's because the more they spend, the more they got paid. Now I have to bring this up because it's been discussed online and you explained it all, but there was like some discussion that you, you were misrepresenting where you were running.

Speaker 8:          02:35:07       There was a confusion as to where, just so everybody knows what the actual facts are, where are you running for Congress and when so people can support you. Sure. Uh, the election is November 4th, 2014 I'm running in the 23rd district of Florida will be no world. Then I said, here's the, here's the problem. If you run as an independent candidate and you decide last minute to jump in, which is what a lot of independence do, you get your fucking ass handed to you. So instead we're being very deliberate and slow and careful and gradually building this thing out. We've already had like 110 people sign up to volunteer or volunteer to help us campaign. And uh, we're raising donations. We filed with the FEC but we filed with the IRS. We have all of rough financial stuff figured out and the chaotic dotting all of our i's, crossing our t's.

Speaker 8:          02:35:51       So that's why we're running so early because we actually want to win. This isn't some halfassed independent campaign and make a point. It's to actually win. And I had never said I was running in 2012 what happened is I did a Reddit Ama were a couple of guys swooped in and I think it might have actually been one guy with two usernames and they kept saying his campaign's a fraud, don't contribute to it. It might even be illegal to contribute to this campaign. They're saying this shit. And then as soon as I saw it, I replied and explained everything. And there was some confusion about the district cause it was previously called the 20th district. And so at first our website did say 20th district. It was redistricted. I mean redistricting is incredibly complicated. I don't fully understand it, uh, be honest about that. But, uh, so I responded, any rational person who read that would say, okay, this explains everything.

Speaker 8:          02:36:34       But then these guys down voted that comment. So it was buried. If you were skimming, you're like, why didn't he answer this? And then they would post it again and I would comment again and they would download it like negative 10 votes and then that was, I was like, this is fucked. Like I'm done with the Reddit Ama for today. Cause it was so good. And then a couple people went in and ruined it. You think that that could be people that look at you as a potential threat in the future and they want to try to squash him now I don't know if I'm that important yet. I think they're just assholes to figure out. There's going to be a certain point in time when you are, there are trolls out there and it, there are trolls out there and they do love to take people that, yeah, they see somebody who's putting their ass on the line and they don't really like that cause it calls them out.

Speaker 8:          02:37:10       You know that they're just sitting there criticizing other people will also, you're, you're smart and what you're saying is pretty fascinating and what you're saying, you have a lot of conviction behind and people don't like people that are better than themselves. They know they're going to like someone who they can't like look at him and look. They look at what I've done in my life by the time I'm 26 and I'm kind of a fucking loser compared to this guy whose last name is seaman. Fuck. The last name is ridiculous. Yeah, but you've got to keep, I'm not going to change it. You've got to own what you are. My last name is fucking just like, you should change it to that David. Just warm, just like David Seaman. Do you really want a man in office with the last name sperm that's going to, is that going to be a part of a campaign against you?

Speaker 8:          02:37:53       Is Mark? In fact, if anything, the last thing probably helps with young voters, but uh, David voted against the Patriot Act white splatter on the screen to be serious for a second. What's really important about my campaign, it's not even that one person out of 435 member house. It makes that much of a difference aside from being able to introduce legislation, which will make a difference. But the big thing is if this actually happens, we're going to create a handbook and distribute it to other people around my age and in anybody's interested in running and not interested in affiliating themselves with super pacs are with lobbying groups or with one of the two big parties. You show them the handbook of here's how it can be done. Use the Internet instead of a party. Raise small individual donations. Remain relatively honest. Don't fucking sell out six months before the election to the Koch brothers or something.

Speaker 8:          02:38:38       And if you release this handbook and you go, this has been done before, here's the, the recipe. So many people will flood into congress who are more like more like you and me. Just actual people who are pissed off at the way things are going and feel like if we had some rationality in there and things would get better and you're already seeing that happening, like it's going to happen. It's just, I'd rather have it happen two years from now instead of 10 or 15 years from now. Do you think that you have to worry about your safety with this plan in mind? Do you think about that at all? What I'm doing is a great thing and I mean to worry about your safety for just trying to improve the country. Isn't that crazy though? It is crazy. I bet people say like, you're probably on some lists now and I used to be like kind of, uh, Alex Jones about, about that.

Speaker 8:          02:39:15       I was like, Shit, I probably am on some lists, you know? But now I think it's kind of, I'm kind of flattered by it. If the government's reading my emails and my texts are probably a little bit impressed that Dell and I have marshaled this kind of support this far out and that our, our campaign is really just about what we say it's about. It's not actually secretly backed by the clean coal lobby or some bullshit. It's just the campaign of people who want to see better representation and that's all it is. So if they're watching you, they're probably a little bit impressed, no longer afraid of, you know, having somebody Julian Assange be by hooking me up with some like hooker or something and the taping it, you know, if that happens free hooker, I dunno, Hooker, um, I mean this, but if you look at what this a NSA building that they're putting together in Utah, that's going to spy on everybody you know, and store all your data for all your emails and text messages and all that craziness. I mean that to me seems like they think everyone's a threat. So your threat to dude, if you're on the show, well that's, that's why we got do this now is in like within next two years instead

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       of 15 years from now we won't have, we won't have a republic cause it's going to be, oh you want to run for office? Let's pull up these emails that we have in our NSA database of you saying this pretty scandalous shit to somebody. What do you want? You want us to go public with this because then it's going to run your campaign. Then you go, okay, I'll resign. Is there a way

Speaker 3:          02:40:28       change the tone of this country? Is there a way, I mean because of the tone of this country clearly changed on September 11th clearly it did. It went dark. Everything went crazy. We realize the repercussions of what the fuck we're doing. I mean if, if, whether or not it's a, a, a false flag event and they, you know, they orchestrated it or terrorist hate us so much. They're willing to fucking sacrifice people's lives and fly people into buildings. Whatever's going on. We realize there's repercussions to whoever is in office, being an office, whoever is in government, whoever's in conducting world affairs, who else? There's obviously some fucking chaos because they wanted to make a big noise. They wanted to make a big splash and kill a bunch of people.

Speaker 4:          02:41:05       There are two. How can that change? Two things that could change. One is shows like yours where you're opening real conversations and shows like yours where the people on TV with Abby Martins shell, you know you're like, oh, she's kind of like me. She's not some last robot, she's not. Some plastic person is just being fed these Fox News talking points and you probably know at the end of the day, at the end of the day that you're at the very least distracting people from the real issues. I'm sure those people go home knowing that and they go, well, I'm getting paid $3 million to do it, so who really gives a shit, you know? And that that's the first thing. The second thing I think is a, you just have to keep going. Like, you can't stop just because there are some issues out there. I feel a lot of people, there's a silent majority who is fed up with the TSA groping them and fed up with US spending this much money on programs that we maybe don't really need.

Speaker 6:          02:41:50       Well, the problem with the surveillance data is the chilling effect. It makes people a stifled into not dissenting, not speaking out as much because when, you know, if you have a mic, if you have a recording device on a table, you're not going to say the same things as you were before. And so when you know that you're being watched everywhere, um, recorded everywhere, surveilled, uh, data, mind, you're not going to speak out as much. I've heard I've had so many people say, you know, aren't you terrified? And I'm like, I'm just speaking the truth. I'm just speaking what I believe and, uh, you know, talking about what I'm passionate about and if, and if everyone kind of shed themselves of that fear and didn't let that affect the way that they acted, then I think that the country would be a lot different.

Speaker 3:          02:42:28       They're not going to be able to hold on to that kind of power. I don't think it's going to be exclusive to them. I think the Internet, the, the, the, this, just this sort of intertwining of information into our lives. I think it's going to get to a point where there's just this zero point, well, there's this point of, you know, what Terence Mckenna called ultimate novelty or we're going to reach some new paradigm, new shift in English. Yes. Look, we look at, we can do now, but just with Google and cell phones and just the ability to talk to people where you're driving your car home and see, it's really a crazy connectivity that we've sort of taken for granted because it's just Bluetooth in my car. It's kind of cool, but you get used to it after awhile and you do business while you're stuck in traffic.

Speaker 3:          02:43:06       But that's a, it's, it's a weird thing and that's just what we know exists. Could someone invented it? They haven't stopped doing that. Okay. They're going to continue and they're probably on the cusp of releasing some shit over the next decade or so. That's going to make that look like nothing and then no one's going to have any privacy and we're going to have to accept this whole idea of like humans being one. You know that the human race is just one big gigantic super organism. Well that's going to be real as fuck. Like it's not just going to be some sort of a hippy dippy yoga phrase, you know that you say because it makes you feel better. It's going to be, it's going to be real. You're going to be able to see, everyone's going to know the real live repercussions of all sorts of different types of behavior.

Speaker 3:          02:43:46       We're going to be able to see how people really feel about each other. We're going to see, you know, how people really view you. It's going to be very different than life now and it's inevitable. It's not gonna. It's not gonna stop. Just like we were one point in time, animals with no communication whatsoever. We were one time single celled organisms with no, you know, no way of making any noise and we became this thing and this thing is not going to stay this thing forever. This thing's going to be some wait fucking crazier. So are all of our problems that we have right now are the the monkey mind, the fucking wild male dominant chimpanzee mind that's trying to take over the world. While while this is happening, technology is just moving closer and closer in on it and it's scrambling and they're trying to do the most arcane.

Speaker 3:          02:44:32       We can just lock them up for no fucking reason. Yes, lock 'em up and they're, they're doing all this things. It's because the, the troops are circling, people are circling. There's like this big ant death spiral of the more madness that we operate under, the, the more access to information than we have. The, the crazier it's gonna get. It's gonna get to a point where it can't be contained because everyone will be involved in it. It won't be as simple as there's world bankers can tell the, you know, the troops to move into certain positions. The troops are going to know exactly where it's coming from. Everyone's going to know where it's coming from. Everyone's going to know why it's coming from, from, from, from whatever. You know, whatever group is pushing, whatever agenda that's forcing people that die and they're going to be punished for it.

Speaker 3:          02:45:12       There's just no way. There's no way you can keep this fucking game going on unless you bomb us back to the stone age and it only a few thousand people survive, then it's possible. So if you are real speculator, and if you looked at like if you looked at the human race and listen we, there's no way we're going to be able to keep this up. We're going to have to do is build something about five miles into the ground and we're, we can keep you alive for about three years. That's what we need. And we need about a year for the radioactive waste to die off. And then we come up back to the surface when most of the people are dead and we start all over again. Follow the apparently this part five minutes folks. 12 what is going to, I can't, I can't keep going. Yeah, there has to be. I don't think there'd be as many people online trying to change things if we were all hopeless. I mean if we're very truly hopeless, like people like Abby and dude, like if you care about your country, you like to see it do better. Yeah. You don't want to see it devolve into a bunch of fucking Walmart parking

Speaker 8:          02:46:10       lots and protesters being beaten and surveillance cameras everywhere. I think our goal of mean to or being like upbeat throughout this show, like we failed. It's not hopeless. It's ridiculous. It's not hopeless. It's just ridiculous. The human society as we know it is a temporary thing. It's not going to stay this way camp.

Speaker 1:          02:46:28       It just can't [inaudible] this is the way of fucking books and town meetings where two people talk loud cause they had no microphones. This is the way of the small tribes led by a few leaders. Shit doesn't work anymore. So it's a global world environment we're living with. That's what we're living with. But we're, we're, we're, we're all connected now.

Speaker 8:          02:46:47       Does Jason Silva videos where it's like an amazing future is technology is uplifted us. That's what happens if we actually do our parts and speak out and take a role in government, take a role in the media and getting the truth out there. That's what we get. That's our reward. If we actually do our roles as individuals and as a community, if we don't do those things, we don't get that. It's not just gonna magically happen. I really don't believe that. I think if we don't do our parts, we end up in a place that looks more like, I kind of like total recall version of the future. People are living in small dingy apartments and there are cameras everywhere and see secretive police pulling people away for no reason. Just total bullshit power, power to take, take back the message and take back everything around you. I mean, we built everything. Human beings are amazing creatures. Look when we're done, I mean we have the ability to take it back. There's also the,

Speaker 1:          02:47:33       the realization that we're not going to be human beings forever. You know, just like we weren't rats forever after the, the asteroids hit 65 million years ago, there was just like rats. Now somehow or another it became monkeys and it became people. There's not going to stay people. It's just were clinging on. We're imperfect beings, clinging to our existence. And it might be that this, this symbiotic relationship we have with technology might mean that the next form of life is an artificial one IP. That we're here to put that into reality. We're here, we're, we're the bees making the hive and don't really know why the fuck we're doing it. We're the animal that pollinates the plant, where the, where the thing that starts up the next stage of life, emotionless, something that doesn't, doesn't have ego, doesn't use resources, intentionally recycles everything and doesn't reproduce more than it needs to. And that's the next stage of life. And the next stage of life creates the next and it keeps going and going. And we're just all cocky and shit. And we think the only kind of life is biological life. And it could be that we're here to make some new shit. And that we're just, the things that stay alive until this new thing comes online. So, and then

Speaker 8:          02:48:40       if that's the case, you congressional Riendeau mean shit side unfortunately. Well it's, I mean it does. I mean it's something for now for us it means a lot. John Connor, whatever his name is. John t toward the guy. The time traveler. Fuck. This fucking show has been a drag. I'm sorry. Not Tomorrow. We're going to talk about roids. We're going to talk about, um, we were bringing in victor contact,

Speaker 1:          02:49:01       who's the guy who got era. He got arrested, went to jail for the ball coast candle, the Barry bonds thing and all those guys. He got uh, steroids. It were undetectable. She'd be fascinating. He's going to find, tell us how many different people are cheating in sports. Apparently it's everybody apparently like you. You can't be a high level athlete unless you're doing something that's funky. If everyone's cheating, that doesn't that mean like nobody's cheating? I guess what I've always wondered, just stuff like that. I don't think it's everybody. I think I'm exaggerating. I think it's 80% of the people. But you know, a lot of them are the best people. I mean, this Lance Armstrong thing, it's pretty crazy. You know, at what point in time, I mean, how many different people you have to get busted before you go, Hey, are you guys all on that?

Speaker 1:          02:49:39       Just tell me the truth. Why did, why did they wait this long as a foreigner to attack a national hero? They built this guy up and now they have to tear him down. I don't think they should have been done after the second when I to do that with helps to just over pot. No, they didn't. No they didn't. They never tried to prosecute him as lost his living man. This is a big, big difference. The witch hunt, they're trying to take away his titles. They've stripped him of, you know, all of his Tour de France wins and apparently, you know, the, it's American doping society or anti-doping society that's doing it or whatever the fuck the name of their organization is, their DEA, whatever it is, mad, whatever it is. They, I mean, they don't even, they don't have the right to take it away.

Speaker 1:          02:50:15       It's not, they didn't award it. I wonder what's going on with that. He did something to somebody, you know, maybe someone was like big Sheryl crow fan and when he started banging Sheryl crow like that's it. This motherfucker, he's going down one ball and all. They can take him down. They can take anyone down. Yeah. Well it sounds like he was cheating on me and I'm not saying you shouldn't do it because it seems like everybody was doing it, but it seems like everybody was doing it. I mean, I don't know. Don't know. I don't know. But the, the guys passed a bunch of drug tests. It seems to me that you're wasting a lot of money going after some guy just because a bunch of people said he did some things and you got all these drug tests that he passed. Could you imagine if that was like with you at work?

Speaker 1:          02:50:51       You know, I fucking know David Seaman's smoked weed, man. We took the cleanse together. You're like this son of a bitch. This guy tested positive and you tested negative and they'll go after you for years and years and years after you've already quit ups. I mean, that's really what's going on. He doesn't ride bikes anymore and they're fucking still dragging this guy out of jail or in the court rather. And they finally, he's just quitting. I don't know. But apparently we're gonna find out tomorrow. Don't do that. Stop confusing the shit out of me. We're going to find out tomorrow from Victor Conte, he's gonna, he's gonna let us know. And apparently there's a lot of different ways to do it where it's not dangerous. You can elevate your levels of testosterone and all these different substances legally and healthily. He's going to show us that to just get subs.

Speaker 1:          02:51:29       He sells stuff like Zma, zinc, magnesium, zinc and magnesium supposed to up your testosterone. I need that. We all need that. Listen, Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for coming here. We have to have one with just you and low alone. We had a little bit of a scheduling issue, Abby. So next time we'll do it. Just you. Is that sound? Good. And we'll do that. November. Yeah. Do that. Okay. We'll do that. I remember. And Dude, anytime you want to come back by yourself to please you guys do on my mind. Sometimes I would love to. Do you Skype it or do you do it live or we could do a live before I leave California. When are you leaving? Well, let's talk about, let's talk after this at fall. Abby Martin, Abby Martin on Twitter. Uh, what is it? The underscore seaman deep sea fuck heads.

Speaker 1:          02:52:07       He a man. And if they want to go online, it's David Seaman for Congress and they can sign up to do like volunteer David Seaman for Congress, [inaudible] dot com.com.com and they can sign up and volunteer, donate or just learn more information about what to do and stay posted folks, because we're gonna, we're gonna keep having guys like David on and guys and gals rather like Abby on. And you know, there's a lot of things that I didn't know. There was a lot of things. I'm sure you didn't know either about the way this world works and the more it gets exposed, the less they can keep doing it. It's nonsense. We live in a fucking co raising world, but if it wasn't for guys like you, most people wouldn't know about it really. So thank you very much for coming on. Thank you very much for doing what you're doing and you're showing our tea.
