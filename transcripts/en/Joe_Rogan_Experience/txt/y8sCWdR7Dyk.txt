It's not easy, but it's very easy when you look out of the rug. Do you know he had little hammer? I don't think anybody who was born here will ever appreciate it. Like someone who comes here from somewhere else.

Speaker 2:          00:49:21       Well, we all, everybody in this fucking room started coming over on somebody. Did somebody to some of your background or somebody did what they did? How many generations have you here, man? My great grandfather from one side came from Ireland. I've seen like the paperwork and I think the other from Scotland and somehow, I mean, this is what drives me the most crazy about all the anti immigration shit in America today. This is whole country is made out of immigrant immigrants, the whole country by yet dental, Amy, Allen, Americans total. So much. Any guarantees, even native Americans seem to you, they walked over thousands of years ago. I can't eat silencing me signing oil, everyone and everyone. Everyone. Yeah. You have you done the 23 and me or anything? I need to do that. You know, it's so stupid how a lot of people knock it, but when I read mine, I looked into it for a few days and you learn about history.

Speaker 2:          00:50:21       Yeah. You know, I have a little Chinese. Really? Yeah. Because you can't me Dan Keana. No, spitting the bottle. On Monday I went and did you have any idea? You had Chinese and you know Chinese because the Chinese made the first real thing. They found chickens in San Francisco that had that DNA from that shiny. It's very the worst thing you could do if you smoked pot, it's spitting a bowel and get the report back. That is a fucking nightmare. Once you realize who you are on the do Mondo Papalia who you can see, it really messes with you. For a couple of days I was rushing and you, I was western African, western Africa and Africa, which I always knew. I'm Cuban and you can't bring it up when you see a bar Cuban, it's a black dude that speak Spanish. Black Dude just speak Spanish. They Africans. Yeah, so I knew that there's, there's African blood and the top, it's not Spanish, they call it something else.

Speaker 2:          00:51:25       It's Spain and something else up there. That's where, so they went all the way around and the last little bit is Russian Jew, like 2% of them. God knows where he got that from. But here's the problem. If you're native American, it can't give you an ivory blend. So that's where we're really from. Wow. Nah, probably with Jeremy. But if you're American and deal with that thing, they can't like my wife's American Indian, I see her grandmother. I was the only grandfather, bro. Fucking Indian. Okay. The mother got the off the Terry, the Indian fucking lip from doesn't read it. It doesn't read. If you're Indian and unless you're a couple of generations back then my mom knows eating. You can see through it ain't, I met a guy. I know. It doesn't have to read the native American. No, it doesn't read it unless you're three or four gender or something.

Speaker 2:          00:52:12       Can you got to ask my wife? That's why she don't buy into it because it didn't tell us she was an American Indian, but the sister did. So it's kind of fucking weird how the sister had a little bit more, my wife's stole, had it, but not as much more of her Irish. That's interesting. You know, it doesn't take a gene. Last night we were playing to get this fucking savage, fire it up. You got to play the old school Cuban music. I told him, this is what it needs to play before he fights. You should've seen them. You should have fucking Sam. And uh, he, he was explaining to Lee and his manager that if you know anything about Cuba will fucking, it was a slave mom. It was a fucking slave market, you know, that's why they bought them. That's where the white people went and saw a sex show while they were there and took a couple of slaves back to them to all alibi.

Speaker 2:          00:53:01       Moreover, the fuck they were from the reality of it. So a crazy beautiful to be here now though, Huh? Dot. Contento. Si. She got him. I said, why? He say, can I see how the output I met up with Danielle. I eat, that's what I meant. The tagging, locate your career and not just, uh, that to be here, but to also be doing what he wants to do, you know, for people don't know. And another job, it's a documentary called something brothers. It's about the two Cuban to live on. Leave on Fernandez. Brothers live on and do dookay come on guy. One guy comes first and wins the world series and the other brother got blackballed and cube and they threw eggs at his house. Wouldn't Fidel wouldn't let him play baseball and on more, what's the name of the documentary? Brothers and arms, his son, Jesus Christ, Joe Rogan.

Speaker 2:          00:54:02       And then they could regs at them. They wouldn't even let her, he had to play on the field like he had to play like, like how he boxed. He hadn't had Duke at her von Hernandez. And then that mother fucker came left his wife and daughter Joe Rogan. And then this mother fucker goes up to New York and tears them up in New York, like fucking one world series. And then at the end he fucking wins in San Diego, but he can't get his daughters and his wife up here. So they got some reporter in Washington to call up fucking cardinal and why fly to Cuba that night? And they flew to Cuba that night and Fidel was watching the fucking Yankee game. Jack. And the cardinal game, the known, there was a note from Hell dookay saying, please let my wife and daughter go put them on a fucking plane.

Speaker 2:          00:54:54       Fucking ticker tape parade. The sister wife at the end goes, listen, I'm in New York and a fucking float. They just want them. I see all these people throwing toilet paper. I started grabbing it because in Cuba you have to fight for a fucking roll of toilet paper. She goes, here they are throwing toilet paper at the parade and her natural instinct was to grab the toilet paper because I had done Larry Young for nothing Nigga. No, I don't know. Young Kid. He's like a thousand and boy, I only got time for you. I'm dope. I bet they thought, oh hey [inaudible] and go up. No, we have a bed there. Toilet.

Speaker 2:          00:55:31       That's fucking crazy, Joe. That is crazy. But I feel like no one appreciates America more than someone who was born somewhere else where they're suppressed, where it's hard and then they'd come over here and then they appreciate like, I think too many of us take this for granted every fucking day. I see it and it drives me fucking crazy, man. I see it in the drives me crazy and we complain more and keep getting more immigrants and these immigrants, well, they're taking our jobs. No, there fucking hustling. Yeah, they're hot. They have no choice. They try the whole thing. The country's founded on. They drive an Uber 16 hours a day. You don't find them. I know kids didn't go to college and can't imagine they've got to work five days a week. Yeah, we work seven days a week. It's in our fucking DNA. That's, you know, happy to be here and happy to how can be here. Yeah. Now when you were in Cuba, the work ethic though with the wrestling and being on the APP, that means that the intense amount of work, that must translate very well into MMA training. Do you think that MMA training is as hard as wrestling training?

Speaker 2:          01:02:10       you can't prepare a 12 year old from Olympic Games because there's no Olympic Games. Right.

Speaker 6:          01:02:49       But is it the same way it, so it's not just you're saying, not just mentality, but something else sees um, Med Todo Lo here. I don't know what I mean.

Speaker 2:          01:03:01       No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I ain't go the pen. The law,

Speaker 2:          01:03:15       depending on the goal, on the age and depending on the goal, when you were 18, how many hours a day.

Speaker 6:          01:03:23       Exactly. It's a laid out on that pitch. I said, Pesa at 18, you start lifting this house at best side. I did dental DSE say this. She said, Dan. Yeah, 16 or 17 best time goes [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          01:03:38       No young kids lift weights in Cuba. A smart, and when they have you lifted weights, what kind of weightlifting? Like Olympic style, the pest side, powerlifting bestseller, Olympic. Oh, Papa.

I topples general orientation with large weights, but the vessel, the large amount of, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I think, but he made, shall I say I'm test first. They test you. They test your strength. I said, when I put it right there to Bezel, my weight can do nobody else. Do you know what I'm gonna tell him? [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:04:38       not a category. You understand talking about that. I mean, Mac, I think that I made him mad that barely fit in the festival. We're from the same, we're the same age, but different weights. Okay. I think that I think will not pray wrong. They give me a try out like I'm okay. For example, Todd bench press.

Speaker 2:          01:06:00       so they know when you're up in weight, when you're down in weight, they know everything about you because they've been doing it for so long, right? So they base you off that weight, you do that thing a hundred pounds. Now they base you off that way. If you're a heavy weight, do you still follow that system? Now when you train for MMA, like how do you decide you do? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Because you still obviously have a lot of muscle. You're obviously still doing some strength and conditioning work. You can get glasses them. What do you mean?

Speaker 6:          01:06:27       [inaudible] Gamille and put a hand Bryant and allocating as an entity. [inaudible] National Olimpica what did that one though?

Speaker 3:          01:30:22       do you think that in America, particularly today in the UFC, this is common because it gets guys attention and they see like Conor McGregor who makes a lot of money because not just the visibility cause he could fight really well, but also because he talks shit really well to Timmy. I understand a little bit, but I wanted him Moses. Why USC Guy Handicap long anyway, I called them Lando for sure. For sure. Oh sure. Yeah. Listen going on his collar, right corner. This corner. That's why. That's the way you say I know many people like him like a corner and and and, and in Cuba and the national team. Many people they days, right. This is what I see right now.

Speaker 5:          01:31:17       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:31:18       Paul. Okay. You have to be [inaudible] what he's saying right now, he's already lived. He's already saying this. The quite stay in 15 years at together. No, no sir.

Speaker 3:          01:32:20       meadows for you to be there, you have to be in the top four. So that's the pressure to get them to the part of the metal, the top four and every division and every sport. Yeah. Yeah, because I'm not a, I'm not a tonic. You're losing this position. For example, in soccer, you come on time. I broke down the block. Okay too. Then number four, you are number four go. But out of sight, they don't bust my ass. Whooped. Got Your went harder. Two more came out and I said she on that guy, that protein. 20 people, 20 people, the Templo, a soccer playing soccer. Tim, I think it's steady or 24 people. I think so teddy people. So you're number three, you're number three. He said, not a guy. He said the bed and another company in another city. They said, okay, you know number three and now I know that guy.

Speaker 3:          01:33:22       He push you, you need him off. You didn't move. He coming and you go, you go home, you're gone. You don't understand. That's it. Not just give up. So the pressure is intense. So 15 years. I am. See many people come and go, ah, well chunk time that people, this jail is good and that idea and this to here and three here, this guy's coming in again because he's beat it. It's better said, hey, hey man, you come by here for it. They're not as Paul. No, only wrestling. Right. I understand. I can your boiler, we read come. He could live with this or what's going on. I thought you said he had gone live with the competition.

Speaker 3:          01:34:09       You're going to look at, look at, stopped by something other than you've ever seen. He couldn't live with it and it's no big fucking deal. Many people know who I am to make it the same. What are they going to do it right, but cooler. This corner. They're not [inaudible]. They're faking it. Yeah. I say this, I make it clear for corner. That's just the thing. I said him and now she made me, he wa she hasn't necessarily get out cause had choir. They see fake. You're not because [inaudible] is no like this. Well, it's interesting like Anderson Silva made it to the top without ever talking. Shit never talked shit. Anderson Silva was always respectful people.

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       People went to see him and bought his paper review just because he was a bad mother fucker and they wanted to see him fight. It was a hundred percent based on this ability to happen, the fight

Speaker 1:          01:35:09       and it's on beat two bedroom [inaudible] yeah, this is not fun. Yeah. That's just not fight. You understand. Right. He's quiet back this day. He says, yeah, he put it there then the Moscow Moscow and now that's just not funny. He know he know needed imitation corner. Cause Vito was saying that Anderson was fake and he wears a mask and that's not who he really is. You understand? So Anderson took it very personally. Yeah. Personally. Yeah. I never see and it's own like this. No, that was very professional. You understand? That's a way you say. Yeah. And now the people want the money. No Man, you do, you know, comment [inaudible] you a fire. Right. You fight it and kill the people. Take it, the hand there and Amano and now the paper pay you. Right. Well now that when you go fight again, the people pay pepper bill because the people want to see you. Right? The people don't want to, you and I, okay, so you want to say something? Say by not, not Eh. [inaudible] no, don't imitate. You know, there's too many people. There's definitely a lot of people that were doing that, doing a bad job of it. It's okay if we look at the way he thought, Luke Rockhold

Speaker 1:          01:36:27       man [inaudible] again, I say, hey look, and now you're seeing and now you'll remember.

Speaker 1:          01:36:40       Why are you taking me? And you say you are, go to our hunger. We'll go out, we'll do the party. And when you stay with me, you say me. Hey, you want to fire me? He said No. Why? You asked me why you ask say no, you want to fight with me? She doesn't know the question. The question is you want to find me. So this is before the fight. You guys had a conversation long time, long time ago, and he said he didn't want to fight you. He say he know want to fire me. He said, okay Bro, she, you know, won't find me. I know if I you, you understand what, what was that about? Why would you guys say that? Why would you have this conversation or you're in the same division? Yeah. Why would he say that he doesn't want to fight you. I don't know. You need it. Ask Him. No, me. Because I know [inaudible] Sala competitors here, he's going to start the conversation. Right. Okay. You need to ask him. Right.

Speaker 5:          01:37:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:37:32       Because I know you stay in me in the same car and the same division. Right. She, you know what if I me lose it. Oh, she didn't want to stay. If you don't want to fight, right. Either go up. Yeah, go, oh, I'll lose it. Right. So you wing. I am when the financier boom, right. If and I, when we're going to have to fight. So when you finally did fight him. Dot was when

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       you felt he was disrespectful. He was talking to a lot of shit.

Speaker 6:          01:38:01       That's it. What I think on things they get [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:38:10       uh, before what happened with do Sada

Speaker 6:          01:38:12       [inaudible] that's what happened every time when he said me,

Speaker 4:          01:38:18       explain to people what happened. You got Ahold of a tainted supplement. There was something in the supplement that was on that. It was in the supplement. So you got cleared. It's like you had a small suspension.

Speaker 6:          01:38:31       Mr No food is, if it's a supplement, you're going to talk to Mondo. He was bullied, might not understand what happened. And they said, because this superman I take, right, I take it. Why does superman have something forbidding in it? Yeah. Why? Why not before,

Speaker 4:          01:38:56       right. Well, it's very common and a lot of times what happens is the suppliers, when you, uh, save your supplement company and you have someone make some stuff for you and then you package it and sell it, the people that are putting it together for you, they're selling a bunch of other things too. And oftentimes things get into your supplement that aren't supposed to be there. Especially same. No. Timmy [inaudible]. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] to [inaudible] pub with them being, they said that when people see me, yeah, he, Tommy know this has happened to a lot of guys. Question the question, is it true I could go into GNC and buy shit that could get jack? Yes. GNC, yes. I've heard you talking on the podcast, not when I'm on, but other people. Yeah, so I could go into GNC and takes the guy guys. A lot of stuff that you go, if you go into GNC, you'll buy stuff that's on the shelves for a little while and then they pull it and a, when companies sell stuff to them, sometimes they'll say there's one thing in it, but there's other things in it as well.

Speaker 4:          01:40:01       That's a real common thing, especially if something works really well. Like a lot of times the stuff that works really well, people find out. Yeah, it works really well because it's fucking steroids in it. Yeah, you could, I mean it might not just be GNC, just any vitamin store. No, not necessarily GNC, but there's a bunch of illegal steroids at Gnc, vitamin Shoppe and Walmart and more. Yeah. See, this is very, very common when you, when you go to these places and buy these things, there's a lot of stuff at a regular vitamin store that'll make you test positive by Usada. You'll test for banned substances from stuff you just buying a store.

Speaker 6:          01:40:34       Yo, you know, many times I think after this happened, I think in many time imputation people from Cuba take it. People say, okay, you are, you are you, you and you come to Cuba for maybe 20 days. I wanted the people see because the genetic for Cuba off the charts. No. For the no, for the athletic people. None of them. Normally everybody normal. Yeah. Normal people imitation. You need to see, see an open mind. Right. He know. That's what I say. Well, here's how much pain you need to pay for the soup for the [inaudible]. Come on, man. They don't have the money. Come on man. Come on, man. Did people don't have, don't have anything.

Speaker 4:          01:41:43       I know what you're saying. The other thing is you could take all the steroids in the world. You're not going to look like you the way a person like you looks. It has to be genetics, [inaudible] genetics. It took a regular guy and gave him steroids. You would never look like you if they do go home people not what I meant to the methods. Thyroid, no sell high buy the second book that yeah, there's a lot of it is genetics and a lot of it is also, you got to think from the time you were little, you were involved in this intense athletic program. Your body develop that way. Can easy. They could do the whole fico to neck to get dual equipped portfolio [inaudible] cause it's Yotpo. [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:42:35       no, I wanted it. No, believe me, I want to do it. This, that, that invitation people from Kip. I wonder, do people see you want them to go sir? Yeah. I wanted, I wanted to say and I want to see after after. No, no, because this is my second full day for me. You know I wanted to, after they, when I train it, they, when I beat him the barrel because you know, can put it everything what you're doing and to beat it with the people. She I do a ds, he did this and now he can be to him. You understand what I say? Yes. Okay. I wanted the imputation camera for me for three months.

Speaker 5:          01:43:16       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:43:17       For three months. I never take it. Nothing. And now you see what I do understand. Stop Talking Shit. You understand?

Speaker 4:          01:43:27       So people accused you of taking steroids after the tainted supplement thing, but you've never tested positive before or after.

Speaker 6:          01:43:37       Aye. I do for, for the Olympic Commission test, the [inaudible] from 95 he's been testing for the Olympics. Did they mean by the woman picks? I'm sorry. Right. I know [inaudible] never, he never came up positive, you know? But the thing is when someone looks at you, cause you have so much muscle, they assume you're doing something. They'll get the meat at least saying I in the winter. And if Jordan can you get out that said, okay, you have to me told me don't go knock on the door.

Speaker 2:          01:44:16       Yeah, the people phase where there's smoke, there's fire where the people think that if you're doing that, can I just interject here for a second? Cause Look Aoa seed by saying that I said I'll probably bio III. I see. Look here it was, I don't really know. Sorry. Did I say I'm not a racist. I grew up with a lot of Cuban guys, this dark skinned guys and uh, it's amazing. But then you see somebody like to me when I look at a physical specimen, I always compare it to Dave winfield. You Remember Day Jordan feel, can I have a picture of the day when field a baseball player, you know, six foot seven baseball player ran bases, you know on the other hand can say call had to do 4.4 and he did the 40 yard dash and all that. But to me this is just me and I hope I don't get in trouble for saying this.

Speaker 2:          01:45:07       Look at day Winfield's baseball body. He was sick. I saw him arrest from once. That picture that you just had up Jamie. Yeah, right there, man.

Speaker 5:          01:52:58       okay?

Speaker 1:          01:52:58       It's my throat. Jonathan are going to heck come on a car. It's his fault because he didn't have to let him grab his fucking gloves. Right. Do you want me to organize a fun? He let him grab your shirt and then he grabbed his yellow, the hardware for the, he turned my glove. He turned my glove. He sold the moms in my glove. He's, hold on. You grabbed his glove. He told the referee. Yes. Yes. Hey, stay like this guy. He's going up against the wall. Let me, let me remember.

Speaker 1:          01:53:40       Take it that morning. That now they're against the fence. Okay. [inaudible] guantee he grabs his hair first. Your to grip your shirt on and he grabbed my glove. Robert. He lives it. He lets it go up right away so they can apply it, right? Yeah. [inaudible] Bento 15 seconds left. Five email grabbed his glove, but now boom, boom. Hit your head. Yeah. There's a video of that. He's going to ask you a question. Okay. See [inaudible] if he sticks his finger in your fucking I get calls. I said, so what is that? It's a foul foul. How many minutes do you need it for the you recover? It's a good question. Depending on how bad your eyes or hurt it might be over KDC that bring them [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:54:40       We don't want to quite lamentable. How long would it be? I took a few minutes. Okay. All right. [inaudible] if he kicks you in the balls, took a few minutes. Take a few minutes. Okay. I that and I said the one thing [inaudible] guy grabbing gloves. Is it legal to know Google? Okay. She tell you in Garpy one day Cabasa if he punches you, wear your gloves. I want me holding on to your gloves if I'm punching you and I'm bawling on to you. Glove. Is that illegally illegal? Illegal. Okay. Okay. [inaudible] Mario, how much time should have taken off? So what you're saying is you sat down for extra time in between the rounds because he committed a foul right before that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no gentleman gas on top. What he's asking you a question. She, we said say they would have stopped it, but CLR Boudreau [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:55:44       cutout. If she had I been doing SMEs to, if the judge would have seen that came Mary [inaudible] ligament, that he would've seen him ripping off his glove. He gave me me and said, I was so hoping he would've seen him punching him like, no, my mentor went to the input and the organization's not you. How much time would he have taken?

Speaker 4:          01:56:02       Well, he should take points away. This is what I think. I think anytime someone does a foul, you just take points away, click on the old deck, kicking the balls, point away, poke in the eye, point away. Because even if you don't mean to do it, even if you don't mean to do it, the loss of sync, get it. It's still does damage and it's a foul foul. So I think you should get a point taken away.

Speaker 6:          01:56:27       My Jamaica, he didn't say it. She, she knows me. See? No, he has a bad ally. Bet She listen now, but the fight ended poke a second.

It's like, oh, did you already said lucid? They fight at the time when the end that he would've lost the fun. So

Speaker 4:          01:57:01       round was over. You sat down between rounds.

So at the end of the round, the round ends, you're sitting on the corner of the round, supposed to begin. Tim Kennedy standing up and he's like, what is going on here? He thinks maybe the fights over and you're still sitting. Why know he wanted to fight to be, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Okay. LTC. Qiagen hello

Speaker 1:          02:01:01       you knew she had on troll. Who said that to you? They do that. Tim Did. So like, let's be professional. Let's

Speaker 6:          02:01:07       right. Hey, hey. Hey. What was that? Please not do this. He said, well, why not do it right?

Speaker 1:          02:01:19       [inaudible] I said, [inaudible] [inaudible] why will he come up to him and say that if the whole time he's been very respectful at Tim Kennedy, right? I don't know. Because he wants to talk. You know, like a friend. Some weight loss. Get sales. I'm getting a divorce. The Games are they used in sports to try to be your friend? Yeah, that's it. [inaudible] when we were in the fight, she threw me in a van number later. If you watched the fight around, you'll know an FRC. The first round, he wanted easy say, well no, don't get the gun under the wrong. He's second round. He's fight. He's willing to fight us.

And also him grabbing your glove is how he was able to hit you. Yeah, he knew and [inaudible] he didn't touch him in the whole fight. Right. That's what I meant. Just in those last 10 seconds. He Mental Golean Ludo whether you get them real fucking hard. So when you were sitting there, what was going through your mind when you were sitting there and Tim Kennedy was telling you to stand up and you knew that the round was over or the rest period was over. [inaudible] Tim [inaudible] you can look at the top and inside panic domain. Get out my wife Daggum anything to relax. I'm going to get up as soon as they fucking wipe me down. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:03:01       he and and reality and think that Tim, can you make it? He had guys in the states. Okay, your three pence. I'm the way that he was thinking, Hey guys, [inaudible] academy now he wants to come out to finish knocking me out, right. You know all the things that got them through everything. He's saying, okay, how come I didn't bring out all that? Let me let, let me dry me off and then we'll fucking fight. Right. But there was only, you only get one minute rest. You were hurt at the end of the round. There's only one minute rest. But you took a minute and 30 seconds. That extra 30 seconds had to help. Cause he said [inaudible] [inaudible] but [inaudible] why not? I said, God, I can see. Yeah, fuck yeah, but enough for me. Good problem is not his fault. It's not your fault. Let me go see, see, see you as a third lien bill.

Speaker 1:          02:03:57       If he would have been cleaned up and my colleague Tyler left, then they can set it up and get them started with the set. Go out and fight going to me the appointment. Bill McCarthy. Good video on my God, my car. Did he say go put it up on golf, man, they get 33 when he go, he sees and he stopped the 15 day you told him to slow down. So you're saying that that was not a ploy in order to get you more arrest Eczema? I don't know a whole lot of that. No, no, no. Come on. No, no, no. For sure. So the only other fight, well that, that was a, that was a controversial moment. You said that in the Robert Whitaker fight, that was a very, there was a experience for you.

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       You will, cause you went five rounds, came very close to winning the interim title, but came short. Like what did you, what did you get out of that fight? Do you said there was a big learning experience for you? They say, because if we're a good lip at data with a guy through the hate, the [inaudible] will not black at two, two. That was a big learning experience because going fine, she'll be fine with Joel and I will not buy last set. Got it up. But I like that we have for housing called rounds. Uh, last night his managers said that after the fight, when he saw him, that he had a big smile on his face, that one of his content to see, he was very happy. He didn't take that last as serious as he should have booked. Get to dock on dental.

Speaker 6:          02:05:26       Is that same where they lose it one day you learn that and now you see what happened with Luke Rockhold. Yeah. What did you learn in the Robert Whitaker fight about the timing, timing, timing, timing. You need it in a more calm down, Lisa. The people talk about my gas, right? But the most, what does that look at? I'm being pulled that same team Calu Rocco, cal, bill and up and they're getting this down. Farcical, my pencil. Well, the other thing was that

Speaker 2:          02:06:12       Luke Rockhold didn't, it wasn't as easy as it was to fight this fucking guy. You know, he saw that it wasn't that easy.

Speaker 6:          02:06:20       Hmm. Can I go get my salary? Joe Jr on lean more than [inaudible] metal. [inaudible] now he fed NCI, mi manager middle. He had a meal. Quando [inaudible] Johnny called you over training was in Albuquerque with Jon Jones Jovi. He saw something.

Speaker 6:          02:06:48       I let come through lava. No, haddock is they control this attacks. Quando when David [inaudible], when he, when he should attack, he's learned that from John [inaudible] meal and that hadn't happened. With that, go, go, go, go, go, go. [inaudible] go, go, go nursing on monkey. Now not going to tell you what, if you tell somebody, go, go, go. Then I'll fucking machine looking like a fucking tie. That's what happened. You had to learn to pace yourself and don't say [inaudible] sync around. Believe me. Never. Never worried about five bucks because I training everyday to ticket. Then they program. I see two solid community in his gas. You didn't, you didn't get that political power

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       staff. What? You have to be worried if he didn't know that you don't have gas in that. I know have it programmed for five. Come on. The argument has always been the guy who has more muscle has a harder time keeping a fast paced. So what you've learned how to do is to pace yourself for your body type. Does that make sense? Decent Gullah. [inaudible] [inaudible] bye bye for hot. Say Lulu both cause look at too tired to tell these gender. All I can do up to deal [inaudible] I can't think of that. You know the, the like a soccer group shot. Remember when he fought? No, no. The black dude with the crazy. So could you, so could you, I mean when I show the show, could you, I turned the TV off. I was so fucking scared. You know what I'm saying? Like I just turned the TV off. Yeah, he was a beast. But after around and a half, it contains a lot of oxygen. I've learned that from you talking about the UFC that you need a lot of the oxygen. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          02:08:37       no, I'm going to class. How many mouths to taking Minnie mouse, Minnie mouse. The mouse [inaudible] go, go, go. Even have to tell him please. You know, but, but to have all that muscle has, it takes more endurance. Right? [inaudible] go ahead, Mike. To pay off is you have much more power and a lot by law. I honestly, I load my poet, she come on, come on. The old team was looking at my boy can nail. Okay, going to clean because when people look at the thing and they'll pop Micah, Micah, mouse, but I load the more direct that that thick. She, she, she for sure. So you've learned how to pace yourself for your body type and your style and now like that five rounds with Whitaker. That was a big learning experience for you in that way. Yeah. Yeah. So now you're going to fight Whitaker again. Yes. Yes. You look very excited. I think if you win, you will be the oldest guy to ever, well, maybe Randy couture when he won the heavyweight title, but for sure middleweight you'll definitely be the oldest middleweight. I think Randy was older when he won the heavyweight title when he, my whole middle that, oh yeah. See, I think Randy was (404) 064-0640 six Jesus Christ. And he was a beast.

Speaker 4:          02:10:25       He's the band. Yeah. Yeah. Fight was the first light heavyweight since losing to check his first fight. It led to everyone around the beam, the oldest fighter win a UFC belt. No, no, no. That's the EOC bout. No, no, that's not what I meant. Look at one. He, how old was he when he beat Tim Silvia? I had championed typed in us before. Find out he was when he be [inaudible]. You want it to be, I think he was, I want to say it was 44 I want to say it was 44 I think he might've been, yeah, 45 and four months. 45 45 damn. So He'd beat Tim Silvia for the heavyweight title when he's 45 now all due respect, you have to remember that there was the testing back then. They just look at and yeah, he look clean. Just don't fucking testing. They test you at the weigh ins. That was it. There was no random testing. It was no usada it's a different ball game now. As far as guys getting tested.

Speaker 5:          02:11:20       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:11:20       He gets tested the most and the UFC really [inaudible] cause look at you man. Like I wish I'm mad dog two times a month. Two Times a month. Wow. Male. He Sung it. JC piss and blood. They just show up and say by that, sorry. Right now all of us are going to get pissed. Don't mix this test. So we're going to have a real private, you know, it's a funny and

Speaker 4:          02:12:00       New York. It's in New York, New York. Um, and if I would, uh, Chris, Chris Weidman. Yeah. On the it like right. I got the test. You right after you flexed only amazing. Come on. Come on. Well, New York, they just, you know, that was new. New York is very new to MMA. I mean they might have had a couple of years now. It's a funny, like a monster, monster, monster, monster energy drink. Say on my manager. Oh look, it is guy, man. He's dead bones. That and when I go out is a Zack come on most of that. I said, come on monster. So we're going to test you yet. Oh, that's hilarious. That's Hilarious, man. Do you think it's a good thing? Do you side of testing? Yeah, yeah. Yup. Good. Keep everybody honest. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That Chris Weidman fight. That was one of your most spectacular knockouts. Deaf flying knee. Thank you. Whoo. That's crazy you. That's one thing that's unique about you is your ability to just explode out of nowhere. Like you love guys to sleep in the den and then, and then he'd go off me. Yeah. That's your style. Yeah. So unique style man. And what did you wrestle but like that too? Oh my God. By then. Well, my thought. Bingo.

Speaker 4:          02:13:24       That's it. That's it. That's it. You know, it's dependent. When my coach, the wrestling coach Giani

Speaker 6:          02:13:32       [inaudible] Papa, but him, when I do charge of that, he, he said, hey, go. I am attack. I talk. I tell them, eh, that's it. What I want to do. And you haven't made the difference is though the wrestling is shorter time periods. But I told him no striking. I wanted to do that. Lisa did people w lappers you're not gonna make an awesome.

How's he fight with percentages or his EA? Yeah. I think that's Yada Yada. No. K. K. [inaudible]. Okay. Y'All. But I think all day you don't get the idea anyway. That's how your Porto, he thanks God for everything. Plato. You have any of that? Yeah, man. Yeah. He, Oh yeah. He was coming back and gets up and now

But if I handle being in Como and he was preparing himself but he wasn't prepared himself correctly, I tend to now she may be [inaudible] Como Open here. This little trainer really gets him prepared. How he should fight. What is different? Can look at it though.
