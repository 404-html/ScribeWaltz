Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. They try everything. This scare marijuana smokers. Why? Why is that? They should just smoke weed and get their dick sucked. They would change the way they feel about all this. They'd be like, I can't believe blowjobs feel so good, dude. Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude. It's from someone who loves you. Who tickles your balls when you come in their mouth? Hey, while you're high Jesus Louisa's. Okay. They don't know about that. Do they know about that? Because if they do, you know I would imagine if you're a, the sheriff at Greenlee knows about that. If you're a girl and you smoke a couple of hits a weed and then get your pussy licked, that's kind of feel so good. Could you imagine like a shower feels good when you're high? You can imagine how good it feels for girl. Do you think your ass licked? Do I like my ass? Like, yeah. Listen, you and I and you're never going to have this conversation right now. It ends here. It ends here with you. I'm not opening those doors. What kind of a man asks another man. This is like a fill out form for a fucking gang bang video. Okay. Now do you like getting your ass like, because if yes, check the box to the right. That should never come up. You should go from you cradle to the grave without anybody ever asking you do you like it in your ass, right?

Speaker 2:          01:15          Or maybe maybe that should be it. That should be a fun thing about a funeral is you have to write the answer yes or no. Like on a piece of paper and then have it in your hand like when you're done.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Yeah, like in the open casket, I secretly love you. Did you check his note? That was a yes with two exclamation points. You see the problem with the question like do you like your ass? Licht is, that's not how anybody ever asks it. If they're gonna lick your ass, right. They don't go. Do you like to get your ass loads? They don't say that. They would say, do you want me to lick your ass? Huh? Huh. They would have a lot of, has in there. Like, all right. Want me to look your ass? Huh? You do? Huh? Like they're already affirming it cause it's a risky thing to say like, you want me to lick your ass? Huh? Let me try it again, Joe. This is an affirmation of it. You know, it's like you, you want to, we want that person to have an easy time saying yes.

Speaker 1:          02:05          No, no. I, it's like, Huh? You want me to look at your ass? And you go, well that would be cool. Yo, you fucking sick. Fuck. Fuck you. I checked you asshole. Right, right. The bedroom opens up, the camera crew comes in, you've been on the new show. Do you want your ass comes like a big court case where they tried to figure out what what ha means when you add on to it and then the lawyer tries to defend it clearly if she used the word, Huh? She was, she was trying to get a positive affirmation out of him. She was a manipulating his emotional responses. The natural responses of a person. He was doing it to be polite. You didn't really want his ass select okay. He didn't want her to feel bad. She said hot already. Yeah. Okay. Well, as it was happening, he was realizing he had made a mistake. Yeah. You know, it'd be like joining an army that thinks they're going to go out and fight big foot. Like you got all your fucking gear and you're ready. Go to the mountains, like we are the sasquatch. And He'd be like, Oh, what have I done? What have I done? I can't believe I'm going to go. This is an army of people I've joined. Fuck, I made a mistake. Shit. He can't pull out of it. That's what it's gotta be like. It's crazy.

Speaker 1:          03:19          Well, that's where you, you know, you are known for not just being, uh, one of the pioneers of MMA, but you're known for that expression Yamato Democracy that you have always, you've always promoted that ideal, this, this Samurai spirit and this, this spirit of Japan, this way of, of doing things wholeheartedly. And you know, you've talked openly that you freely give yourself, like when you would go to fight and you would be ready to die.

Speaker 3:          03:53          Yes.

Speaker 1:          03:55          And not just saying that like you, you would really reconciled it in your mind. You would say goodbye to your friends, say goodbye to your family versus a fire

Speaker 3:          04:02          letters. I wrote letters to people that I wanted to say goodbye to every fight. Yeah. That's some deep shit. You know, it was the thing too is I'm fighting to die flying to die. You're going to train with the will to die too, so you can write it down as good training I got in. Yeah. I mean I'm training every day before the fight, so I won't die in the fight. I'm planning, I'm okay. I'm accepting the fact that I might die there, but I know that the better I can be is the less chance to me dying in the rain. So, you know, I'm not going to get up in the morning and because I'm sore, I'm not going to miss training because I'm tired or I'm lazy because it'll might be the difference in me living in dying in the room. So, you know, it helped me out a lot. And then the training aspect and you know, the dieting, I mean I want to eat, I want to drink a coke, but I'm trying to eat only good things on my before my flight. And it's, it's a lot easier to do that when you're in it to that level. It can't hurt you, you know, to plan to die in the ring to, to believe that and to train and to walk that life for that three months while training for the fight it, they can't hurt you.

Speaker 1:          05:17          Is it difficult for you because you earnestly embraced that thought process? Is it difficult for you when you see guys that are kind of dabbling in mma that Kinda like half asking it, not training hard enough? Maybe they have some talent but they don't really put their will and heart into it.

Speaker 3:          05:35          Well, it's a whole new era now. Yeah. Because back in the day we didn't get paid good. We weren't, we weren't, weren't that worried about, you know, losing a sponsor here, right. Being cut by the UFC, you know, that kind of stuff didn't, because there was all these little association with funding for so little bit money. The objective and the, the, the whole movement of that error was different. Yeah. So, you know, when fighters start getting lazy, you know,

Speaker 4:          06:00          Eh,

Speaker 3:          06:01          or they don't fight as hard or the tap out a little sooner. You know, I understand that because there's a whole new era because you're fighting for a different reason though. They're fighting for money. They are fighting for living. They're fighting for sponsors. If we need to look good, you know, so it's easier when you're fighting for those reasons.

Speaker 4:          06:18          Okay.

Speaker 3:          06:18          I mean, there's only so much money will make you do. Hmm. But if you're fighting for your honor and you're fighting for your life, it's a whole different level. Yeah. So

Speaker 4:          06:31          [inaudible].
