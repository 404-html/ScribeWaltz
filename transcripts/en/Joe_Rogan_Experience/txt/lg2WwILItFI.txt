Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. If you didn't work with people because of their private life and things you didn't agree with, you would never work with anybody. What you imagine their mess, you have to sit down with them and go over their private life. Okay. Have you ever lied to a cop? Right? Right. Have you ever lied about speeding, but you ever not paid your taxes? Now let's get into your sex life. Do you ever think about other people when you come? Okay, this meeting is over. I had a buddy of mine that actually got an argument like that with his girlfriend. She was like, my friend says that guy's fantasize about other women while they're having sex with your girlfriend. Is that true? And he was like, well sometimes she's like, you fucking piece of shit. She got really mad at him. Right. And I'm like, when I, I don't remember thinking about it like, why do you care? I guess if your wife was just thinking about just getting stuffed by some big ass country football player, some big dude with like chewing tobacco in his mouth and a fucking rebel flag hat on. He's just laying pipe on her and that's what you're thinking about when you fucker, she's thinking about some corn Fred.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Imagine, right? Yeah. But it'd be like, Oh fuck man. But that's why you don't ask the question. That's why you don't ask. You'll probably, there probably is happening, but you don't ask if, if you really love your wife, you want to know everything about her. You want to know everything when she's disappointed. Oh my God, you, I love you honey. But I hate that face you make when you come. You make me disgusted. That's why I'm all fuck you. You just walk into the kitchen in the morning, honey, what are you thinking? So next time you fucker just wear a luchador mask or even better yet, like Godzilla. Oh, rubber Godzilla. Hey, fantasies are weird man. Because like I can't, I remember when I was in high school, there was a, a, a guy who was writing for the Newton south high school paper who wrote this cool thing about the boy scouts.

Speaker 1:          02:01          And I remember reading this because I was in the boy scouts briefly as a young teenager and they have, you know the tenants like trustworthy, loyal, thrifty, clean, reverent and like one of the things about what the voice boy scouts were supposed to do is keep your mind pure, right? Keep your thoughts pure. And this guy was like, who wrote this article? And obviously this is in high school in the 1980s guy was pretty brilliant and he was like, I don't like the idea of anyone telling me what I can and can't do with my thoughts because sometimes my thoughts are fun. Right. I like to explore the idea of thinking about and his argument in this newspaper and I'm like grossly paraphrasing him cause again this is like from 1982 or something like that. He was like you like you don't need to know what's going on in my thoughts.

Speaker 1:          02:49          You just needed to know how I act, how I act is important, not what I think. So tell me to keep my thoughts pure. It's like my thoughts are mine right there. Mine. I do what want with them. That's right. So if you girlfriend is just thinking about that big country fucker, a piece of wheat coming out of the corner of his mouth, Nazi Tattoo on the back of his neck, just laying good dick. God bless her fat Dick. God bless her, whatever she's into like a sailor's forearm. I am not asking. Yeah, I mean, do you have moments like in your relationship where you know you're with each other for your life? This is, this is a long time thing. I feel like we should meet and the Seattle music. It was when you're all of a sudden, oh no, no, no, do it. Jamie went to get some incredible hulk walkaway music and there's times when you were into her and that's it. There's times when you know there's times when all of a sudden you, you about to say this times when she's not in the EU. Yes. Unacceptable walk. Be a man. Suck it up. There's times not that psyched with me right now to Casey knee Tan with a boner. You chew to Viagra. You get your Dick hard as a rock.

Speaker 1:          04:01          I'm not saying you don't do those things. What I'm saying is you don't ask her why you don't ask what? What is it like? You don't want to know these things. I don't want to know why she's unhappy. I want to know. I just want her to keep her thoughts to herself. If she's bang some big redneck in a truck stop. No, you don't want, I don't want anything. You don't want to know if she's actually being or thinking about bang. I don't want to know anything. You don't want anything? Oh No. What a good husband. You want her to just be a good mom, a good wife and eat my bread and eat. And how about she cooks something once in a while. Why my baking bread? Like I'm an old lady. Why am I running around with a flower on my shirt?

Speaker 2:          04:57          Okay.
