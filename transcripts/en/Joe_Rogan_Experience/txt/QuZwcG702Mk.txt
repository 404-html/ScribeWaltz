Speaker 1:          00:00:09       Experience.

Speaker 2:          00:00:22       Louis is here from unbox therapy, sweating our beautiful new equipment that doesn't work. Especially our new fucking super awesome HD set up. We were supposed to be live in HD by now, but someone fucked us. They sold us this fucking Sony HD box that's supposed to work great with Ustream. Doesn't fucking work at all with Ustream. Not only is it not work with you steam, it's never been proven to work with Ustream. Use Dreams. Never got one from them to test it lies and propaganda. At least. At least it's pretty looking though. It looks dope as fuck. So we'll probably wind up going with a tri caster cause this fucking sack of shit isn't working correctly.

Speaker 2:          00:01:08       And we're watching, um, that we, we talked about zero before the podcast started that has anything to do with tech. Everything was about sexual allegations, sexual assault allegations, whether or not someone should be rioting, whether or not these fucking idiots that are closing down the one on one freeway in La to protest something that happened in another state. It's crazy times. The yellow is that about all these crazy white, it's all white people that are protesting like in, do you, have you seen New York City in New York City as well? Oh yeah. They won't show it on the news because it's like everyone's like, it's all white people. It's all these like wow. Emo, white people, social justice warriors demanding justice. I Dunno. It's rampant. Everybody's, everybody's trying to latch on it to express themselves through this high profile situation. Well, I think that there's no doubt there can be no doubt that there's a real issue with police brutality.

Speaker 2:          00:02:04       There can be no doubt. There's many instances, and this is not the best one. You know, Jamie was talking about it before the podcast that the 12 year old boy who was shot in Cleveland with a fake gun, a toy gun, like seconds after the cops arrive. That is way scarier to me. That kid that was shot in a Walmart who had a toy gun, that is way scarier to me. You know? Then even asking questions, talking, trying to find out what's going on, they're just shooting. Yeah. It's funny. It's a funny thing about which news stories prevail and become the mainstream ones they need to be. This is sort of perfect and appealing package that people want to share and talk about and sort of that drives conversation. They the, the really like obviously terrible ones that nobody has, you know, like it's hard to have an opinion about that other than that's terrible when when it comes to like a kid shot with a toy gun

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       versus the other one. The other situation in a Michael Brown. Yeah, the Michael Brown situation where for some reason they're appear, you know, there, there's, there's these defined sides on that and that thing. There's very little gray area for discussion. It's like pick your team. We were talking about this before the show, but I was watching on Twitter, a white rapper and a black guy arguing and the black guy was on the side of the cop that shot the kid, the, and you know, it wasn't an asshole, wasn't a Republican. He was saying, look, the reality is this guy had robbed a store just before then had been involved in a bunch of criminal type behaviors. And there's witnesses saying that he charged the cop, like you don't know what happened. And the, the white rapper was arguing with him and he was saying, you are blind to the facts in your desire to be down and, you know, which had to hurt the white rapper.

Speaker 3:          00:03:59       Right. You know, black I accuses you of fucking posing, but there's, I mean, that's, but that's what's happening in the street right now, isn't it? I mean, it's the same thing. It's that it's, uh, it's appealing for people to latch onto a cause in order to help try to identify themselves. Yeah. You know, to get something out of it, to get some kind of very good way of defining it. Yeah. To get some kind of a, I dunno, like they like this, this kind of a wind can be a success for them that they can express themselves through, uh, these kinds of issues. But obviously it's not about, it's not just about a cop shooting a guy. Right. It's like in this particular case, it appears to me that it's part of a much bigger issue in specifically that area. Uh, and, and, and probably the way of life.

Speaker 3:          00:04:43       They're like, is it really, you need to be a certain kind of person to just jump on a riot train, right? Like, oh, wicked, perfect, let's burn down more shit. Right? Yeah. And I mean, sometimes it will be, it's not necessarily just race. Sometimes it will be a certain set of circumstances, like a sports team loses and people go crazy and start smashing cars and whatever, and it, it's somehow attracts other people to that, to that, uh, agenda. I remember, uh, in Toronto during, I think it was the g 20 summit when it was like the first time ever, people had like smashed when I was living downtown at the time. And I had a, I had my first kid will and he was little. And I remember sitting at home inside and knowing that people were out there smashing windows going like, how in God's name are these people justifying it? How, how do they believe for a moment that smashing his Starbucks is what's going to change anything. It's such a weird way to try and get what you want. Is it, is it any, it's not even a Po. I Dunno. It seems to me like the equivalent of kicking and screaming as an adult. Oh, it's, it's even worse. It's so idiotic. There was a Twitter post today that I read where this guy was standing in front of a BMW in

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       Oakland, California, which by the way is nowhere fucking near Ferguson and the windows were smashed and it said, fuck corporations, corporations. Let me tell you something. You dumb cunt. You wrote that on a phone that was made by a fucking corporation. You piece of Shit fucking dunce and you broadcast the damn picture via another corporation that allowed you to even have the voice to reach the people that you ended up reaching with it. And what has BMW done besides make awesome cars? What have they done this so terrible besides making fantastically engineered automobiles that you couldn't possibly come up with yourself? Yeah, I don't, I don't know specifically, but I think it is very strange that people pick and choose which corporations are there for them and which ones are against them. Because ultimately this entire economic ecosystem is what allows everyone to survive and what allows anyone to have any kind of wellbeing.

Speaker 2:          00:06:58       It's not perfect. Everybody knows that. But when you burned down and Mcdonald's in your neighborhood, you're taking away jobs from the people that actually need them. You know what I mean? Like, or the Walmart or whatever, whatever it was at the destruction that's happening over there. It's like by, by force, you want to throw a Tantrum, but at the same time the consequence is bigger than you personally. It's a, there are, I'm sure plenty of upstanding citizens who just wanted to go back to work. And this corporation that you're angry with is actually, uh, something that people rely on in the case of this BMW dealership. I mean, you're talking about such an unrelated institution. Yes. So unrelated Starbucks. There's people that were guarding Starbucks and we're freaking out. Fuck Starbucks. You know, what about the people? What about the people? People pay for that stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:07:53       You know that Starbucks is a franchise, like someone owns it. They had an air earned money, save it, get a bank loan, go out of their way, hire employees, put together a business model. I mean Jesus fucking Christ, this childlike view of the world, and this is not exonerating police, this is not, and I feel for the police because I think their job is almost impossible to be a cop and a crime ridden area is almost impossible. There's almost nothing you can do to stem the tide unless you could go back in time and somehow or another, not even the parents of the children who grew up to be criminals, but the parents of the parents that the children that grubs were criminals and somehow reach them, somehow educate them or provide them with some sort of counseling or some, some factor that's going to change the way they view the world and view community and view each other and give them

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       opportunity. Give them some sort of a way to not be involved in a life of crime, not be involved in these horrible cyclical repeating relationships that seem to occur in these terrible areas. So many factors and, and in many cases, the areas themselves reinforce the behavior, uh, through various means. Like I used to watch the first 48 have you ever seen that show? And you get to see how like immediately after a crime takes place what the cops are working with, uh, as far as the, uh, the evidence, but also, uh, the witnesses and trying to get anybody to say anything about what happened, but kind of like a super core, fundamental level. If you don't want to tell the police that, you know, who killed somebody, is that really any different than participating? Like then being a part of it, it's so weird to me that that's considered to be an acceptable thing amongst that community right there. The no snitching thing and no snitching thing. It's like, hmm. That to me just sounds like you're afraid. That to me just sounds like the actual power within that group doesn't lie within, uh, the police or authority or whoever, but it lies somewhere else. But you're somehow justifying it to yourself by saying, oh, I really am participating because I chose not to snitch.

Speaker 2:          00:10:25       Well, if you live in that community though, and you did snitch, the consequences would be dire. I mean, it's not something that's like an easy thing to stand up for if you're living in a crime ridden.

Speaker 4:          00:10:35       Sure. But then you also shouldn't expect anything to change.

Speaker 2:          00:10:39       Boy, that's, it's weird to put the ownness on the, the, the people that are poor and they're living in these areas. I see.

Speaker 4:          00:10:47       I don't, I, it's not, it's not completely that way. Obviously there are things that could, could happen surrounding that world that could help it out, but ultimately to get yourself up out of there, it has, doesn't it have to be, I mean, who can really walk into that community who's not a part of it and change and change something. It's not like, it's not like you're wanted there, you know? It's not like when the police go in there, they're treated in a certain way because maybe the life they lead is so different than that of the individuals in that, in that lifestyle themselves, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:11:21       well also that US versus them mentality gets some printed. It gets cemented in, in terms of sports teams. So imagine how crazy it gets when you're dealing with crime ridden neighborhoods and police. It's so hard to break free of. I worked as a security guard for a very short period of time when I was a kid and um, it was a place called great woods. Uh, it's like a concert place in Massachusetts. And one of the things that I remember really clearly is realizing that we had all developed this us versus them mentality at the, there was these crazy drunk concert goers who would cause trouble and do all kinds of crazy shit. And then there was us and we had developed as very clear us versus them mentality that I saw people, I saw people act on this against people that weren't a problem, you know, and I remember watching it, you know, kind of step back from it, but a part of it as well because I'm wearing a security outfit.

Speaker 2:          00:12:19       I'm going, okay, we're doing like cop shit. This is like what cops do. Yeah. And then I was thinking like, man, I wonder if that's just like what happens. And you know that Stanford study that they did where they took, uh, they, they, they did like a prison study where they put people in jail and they made one group become security guards and one group become prisoners. I believe it was Stanford wasn't Stanford. Um, but they, they had to call it off. Like they had to cut it short because the people that were, the guards had been so shitty to the fucking people that were the prisoners. They were like, well, this is like inherent human behavior or something like that. It's almost like there's a pattern that people slide into that unless they're really consciously aware of not doing it. Yeah. The Stanford prison experiment.

Speaker 2:          00:13:07       Wow. Yeah. And it was a really eye opening to a lot of people that is power is a very corrupting thing. Right. Especially that kind of ultimate power. Like someone's in jail or you have a gun, you can shoot them and you're allowed to. Yeah. It's a, it's a, it's an unfortunate thing that that's the only way to govern ourselves that we're forced to to do so at the end of a gun, like, yeah. Right. You hope that that, that doesn't have, have to have to happen frequently, but ultimately that's part of what's holding this whole damn thing together. You know, I drive down the highway to get here and he's like, Jesus, everybody is in their lane. All of these different mechanisms at play to keep order to keep things happening and as smooth sort of way. And yeah, there's crazy shit going on elsewhere, but we've also done one hell of a job of having the vast majority of people comply.

Speaker 2:          00:14:03       Yes. Based on the system. That's something that people overlook when they think about chaos and mom society, like God is so safe and organized in comparison to the number of people. Yes. I was in Mexico City reasonably right for the UFC first time. Yeah. Wow. And Mexico City is first of all, everybody thinks like, oh my God, you don't get kidnapped on the God. He didn't get shot. First of all, they are the nicest people. Mexicans in Mexico City are so friendly, they're so nice. But their version of order and our version of order are very different there. You know what, stop lights, optional gridlock. You know how we have grid lock? Occasionally someone fucks up and they get stuck in an intersection when the light changes and everybody beeps at them. In Mexico there is only gridlock, like there's no getting out of it. The lights change

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       and it's just bumper to bumper in both directions. And I saw people that were trying to merge and they would just pull in, they would just pull in front of everybody and you're talking about six, seven lanes and these people just pull into the lane and, and people would just sort of stop and some people wouldn't stop them. They didn't have to pull forward. And it was fucking crazy and it, and I'm laughing, I'm talking to the guy that was driving and I was like, is this normal? And he's like, ah, these none, no. This way in America, no. In America, when it's a red light, people actually stop. It's amazing. It is amazing how well trained we actually are. I mean a light comes up and everyone complies. The odd, it's a, it's a very minor outlier that actually disobeys that even though it's a fairly simple thing and most of the time no one's probably going to die.

Speaker 4:          00:15:40       But we, it's just, it seems like when you're relatively well taken care of, it's so much easier to just fucking comply. Yes. And when you, when everything's okay, when your belly is full and you know your children are safe, the minute that you take away the necessities all it's like, yeah, let's go. There's a thin veneer. Yes. Oh they days and you get like these crazy people like Zombie apocalypse type people. Like it's all gonna crumble. But truthfully speaking, how much would it take? You know, I mean it's not like you need a complete collapse of the infrastructure to get people panicking. I remember that big blackout on the East Coast, uh, a few years back where it knocked gas stations out and knocked most people's houses out and you know, people were running their air conditioners too much and that the panic was real there. People were like, people had to talk to each other, a one to one and be like, you know which piece, which pizza place still has food?

Speaker 4:          00:16:38       Which ovens are running off propane? Like it was dipping quick and I was like a week, my friend Tommy was in Connecticut when that big snow storm hit and he was telling me how they had a drive hours just to use a cell phone. It'll drive like two hours to find a cell phone service. You had to find food like we went, he was saying that we went to, he, you know he and his girl had went to Dunkin donuts for food and there was a giant line outside of Dunkin donuts cause it was the only place to that end. Exactly. Putting your body exactly. Any calories. That's what happened at, that's exactly what happened in my area when it originally happened is essentially you had like one pizza place feeding the entire community until the, until they ran out. And, but it really exposes the fact that we have such, this kind of gets into the world of technology, but like basic skills like sort of just being a human skills, survival skills week.

Speaker 4:          00:17:33       Yeah. In general, in general. Oh across society. If we were forced to rely on our own beans to deal with like a B, c Jesus, take, take away the cell phone on its own. I mean, I'm not, I'm uh, we were talking about doing a video like 24 hours without technology. Like maybe we'll get a map and we'll have a set of challenges. Like, try not to use your phone, but having, being, you know, thinking about that as I was on my way out. I mean, I'm on Google maps, I'm analyzing traffic. I'm rerouting based on accidents. Right. It's like take that away. And how much more ineffective am I at participating in all of that? Yeah. I have a friend who doesn't use the navigation systems. He still uses maps. Wow. I looked in his car like, what? Where's your navigation system? And he goes out the old paper, Matt, when he's an author too.

Speaker 4:          00:18:22       I mean, he's, um, he's a wealthy guy and he goes, I just don't, I don't want to deal with it. I go, we want to do with what the things are awesome. Like, what the fuck are you talking about? Like you, you don't want to be a part of the new information that's coming your way. That tells you how to be more convenient, more, more efficient. You can get around this accident. Don't you want to know it's there? Like why would you, so what do you think that's about wanting to be like living in the fucking past, this longing for nostalgia. Like you know he wants to fucking fall smoke signals to find the village. I don't understand it. It's funny that anybody who's nostalgic like that or avoiding change, they only want to go back so far. They don't want, they don't want to go the caveman style.

Speaker 4:          00:19:07       It's like it's just a, everyone picks a point in their life. Even now I have friends who have picked that point like they're done. This is as far as they're going with technology and like, you know, you're showing them a smartwatch or whatever it might be in, or even even, not that like it could be a piece of software or social media, like they're on team Facebook, but Twitter's too much or something. It's funny how at some point people flip the switch and they're like, this is as far as I'm going with this damn thing. Yeah. Yeah. There's that weird thing that people do. Uh, you know, you have kids and I have kids who I've talked to many people at, man, I wouldn't want to bring kids up today in this world. I'm like, what are you talking about? People brought up kids when they were woolly mammoths when they're fucking saber tooth tigers and like one, one in a hundred infants survive.

Speaker 4:          00:19:55       What are you talking about? This is like the best time to have a kid ever. You know, they have amazing doctors. Yeah, you were. You really have very little to worry about and the kid has so many advantages of themselves from a learning perspective. I am amazed. I have a five and a three year old at how, you know, the unfiltered, maybe unfiltered is a bad word because I don't want them going everywhere that they want to go online maybe. Right, right. Yet. But the idea that they're in control of the information that they participate in, it's like a huge deal to me, that they're not just flipping on the TV and sitting through whatever is programmed for them. Instead they have the freedom to select whatever it is that's interesting to them. And I know that in my life, when I started to really identify the things that I liked, it was when I really started to progress in what I was capable of personally. That's the essence of

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       education, at least the best kind when you have a basic kind of draw to a particular topic and then you get there and then you retain it. That's, I mean that's really the whole package. And uh, I don't know, you know, if we talked about education the last time I was on here, but I mean, I remember growing up and not giving a shit about a particular topic. And then all of a sudden when the Internet was amazing, I find myself hours deep into a particular article or I'm on Wikipedia. It's like, what am I doing right? What am I doing? The old me would have thought that I was an idiot. You know, like, dude, get out and do something cool. Why are you, but it's amazing how the context shifts the entire conversation when you're doing it for yourself. When you're driving your own car, ship, whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:21:33       All of a sudden things become enticing and interesting that when there was like a dictator pointing down saying, this is the curriculum, it just wasn't the same way. It's also the enthusiasm of whoever's telling you about the subject too. Right. There's some people that can talk to you about like, I knew the grass. Tyson is my favorite example because he's so passionate about space and about astrophysics and when he's talking about these things, it becomes fascinating. Yeah. Whereas you can watch a lecture that's given by someone who's just has no interest in the subject, or excuse me, no interest in teaching this subject. They're just, they're just relaying information. They're just getting through it and they think that all they have to do is plow through it without any charisma, without any, that's what I was going to, I was going to use the exact same word, is I think charisma is not something that's abundant amongst people.

Speaker 3:          00:22:25       It's a very special thing that some have, some don't. And it's like, it's not a prerequisite for becoming a teacher. It's not like, wait, let's evaluate their charisma. Right. No, it's, it's, it's a, uh, an institutional kind of approach to how do you pump out, you know, how do you factory farm teachers, right. And, and so it's unfortunately not a very difficult thing. Well, I don't, I don't want to go that far. I mean, it, it does take work to become a teacher, but it's not like, it's not like you're, you're prequalifying them to be entertaining or do you do a good job of, of the things that lock a person's eyeballs onto you. And so there's the, the ratio of teachers that are charismatic versus ones that ended up there is, I don't know that you're ever going to be able to fix that.

Speaker 3:          00:23:12       No, I don't know. I don't know if you are either. It's like trying to find charismatic people to explain any subject to you. Charismatic people that, you know, our managers have an office arithmetic people that you know, talk to you at a hospital about what happened to your kid. You know what I mean? It's just like the charisma or none that, I didn't even know that's the word. But genuine enthusiasm, passion, passion is so contagious. When something happens in the world, uh, and you, you, you can, you can have two options. One is just the facts laid out to you in a very

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       bland, monotone way. And the other one is someone who's extremely passionate about the subject. Two talks about it with like great emotion and, and, and, and, and, and understands the significance of the information and how you are going to react to it and has this understanding of the interpersonal reaction or relationship that's so huge to, to taking in the information, to absorbing it.

Speaker 4:          00:24:08       I think that the enemy of that is the idea of curriculum. The idea that there is a, a very direct and concrete way of learning something like you have this list of things at, by the end of this course, this person's going to know this and that and that, and they're going to be tested on it. If I was at, uh, a teacher or a charismatic person or whatever, it's like, I don't, I don't want to just be your puppet, your robot up there following the set of guidelines that you set forth. They have very little freedom in what they can bring into that conversation against what's been approved by whatever body is responsible for producing that, that information. And you know, and oftentimes it's like the same guy who's standing up there as the guy who's, who's selling you the textbook. And there's like this weird, this weird kind of thing baked into it where it's not where it's about do. It's like the path of least resistance. It's about not ruffling any feathers. It's about just getting from a to B to c without really having a strong point of view.

Speaker 2:          00:25:13       But isn't it also about like you have to have the basic building blocks. Yes. And then from there you have to or you should find something that you're truly interested in and then pick a career. But at what point, at what point do you think that an individual has the basic building block? Right? Where does it happen?

Speaker 4:          00:25:32       Because my opinion it happens far too late. I don't think we were encouraged at a young age to really hyper focus on the things that are interesting to us.

Speaker 2:          00:25:40       Yeah, I think you've got a good point there because I think that kids that do find something that they really enjoy early, they have an an awesome headstart in like, like they have hope as to like what they would like to do, I guess. You know what I mean? Like if you talked to someone who is really involved in pick a field computer programming, they want to be a game developer and they're 14 years old and they already started coding and they're doing something like, well this kid is on a path. Whereas you know, some people are 20 and they're ne'er do wells and they're just fucking laying around eating chips and then trying to find their path. And I just got to find something I'm really interested in. Meanwhile, as 14 year old brother is reading coding magazines and already like reading, you know, reading about John Carmack and how you started off in software and you know, he's like, he's on a path, you know, and getting on a path can give you so much energy and momentum and it makes it so exciting. And

Speaker 4:          00:26:32       an argument would be that would be that, well maybe that's not really where their head was going to be at. Maybe you closed some door and that's, that's like the fear, right? That's what the, that's what like parents are

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       thinking and the kids themselves, that they need to have this vast array of subject matter that they're proficient in because God forbid they end up wanting to do something they're not prepared for. But that's like, that's like a weird way of looking at it in my opinion. I think some people, I think everybody at some point in their lives has a particular skill that's worth exploring, but oftentimes he doesn't fit into the window of, of what will be acceptable at that time. Right. And also your parents sometimes discourage you from that if it seems like it's a tricky subject or it's difficult to succeed in it. Like my parents were not into me being a comedian at hall. Right. You know, when I told my mom was going to be a comedian, she was like, you're not even funny. And I was like, Oh shit.

Speaker 3:          00:27:26       Oh mom, fucking brutal. You want to know something though? Think about the alternative of your mom saying, oh perfect, you're the funniest guy I've ever heard. Like, I know guys like that too where their moms or their biggest fans and it hasn't done very, they're very much about them. That's a good point. Like sometimes it's better if they present you with a challenge. Like I'll show you, you know, like you, if you get too much encouragement or a distorted version of your actual skillset, that can be bad too. Jamie, something's going on in my throat, man. Come on and make some tea. We have tea, tea back there fighting off something but not like a cold or something in my throat. Like I feel physically good but I'm going a lot and I know that shit is annoying as fuck to you folks out there.

Speaker 3:          00:28:13       I think we were a reading before we got going. Is that dude from CBC that was facing sexual assault charges. How do you say his name? John Gomez. Meshy that is a weird subject and a hard subject for me. I have three daughters. And when I read about dudes beaten up, women especially, um, this guy who's like this really left wing progressive, sweet voice guy who would do interviews and talk to people like this, pretty much the idea that that guy was beating women up and you know, and doing it under the guise, I mean, who the fuck knows what the reality is? But the allegations are that he was doing it under the guise of, um, fantasy or sexual fun. I mean, what would you call it? Bondage. Yeah, that's what it is. And it's funny because I remember when that craziness was going on, when 50 shades of grey came out, it's like everybody on the subway train had a copy and I didn't, obviously I didn't, but it blew up.

Speaker 3:          00:29:20       And I remember thinking like, this is the first time that bondage s and m has really permeated pop culture, like in a big way. And the movie is coming out soon too. And I know that he went so far as to reference 50 shades of grey in his argument. Meaning that in some way he felt that that enabled him, uh, some leeway. Yeah. Right. It's, that's, that's, that's, that was a really weird thing to me is like the, the acceptability of that way of doing things like between what somebody wants to do and doesn't want to do. I mean, when you're engaging with somebody sexually, how do you, if all of a sudden, culturally you have this huge book that x number of women reads or read, sorry, how much more likely are they to put up with that? Even if it's not, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 3:          00:30:10       What I'm trying to get at? Yeah. I D is that book about beating them up a 50 shades of grey? I Dunno. I, I don't, I think it's just mostly just rough sex and bondage tying up a whipping, that kind of shit. But I think he did. I think it exposed a world of sexual fantasy that wasn't, I mean, that shit was so mainstream. Yeah. You know, I think for the average soccer mom or whatever, it wasn't in, in their lexicon, pre 50 shades of gray. Now I'm not, I'm not blaming the book or whatever. I mean, people are going to do what they're gonna do. And this guy was obviously behaving that way long before based on the accusations long before that book even came out. But, uh, it seems to me that he, his point is that, or at least his defense is that this was simply rough sex.

Speaker 3:          00:31:00       Right? Right. And that was working for him for a bit because the initial accusations, as far as I know, were sexual partners. He had had girlfriends, right. But then these other accusations started coming out about girls who wouldn't participate, who are just getting, showing up and getting beat up and being asked to leave. And there was no sexual element at all. So it, you know, it appears that the guy has some kind of, uh, issue. Uh, I don't know why it's so disturbing to me, but what, what gets me is these guys that are like these really sweet like, like, like soft-spoken, like you know, you, you, you just picture him cuddling. You couldn't even picture him fucking, you know what I mean? Like I couldn't picture that guy with stuffing a girl in the corner of a couch fucking hammering away. I wouldn't think of him being doing anything going down in that way.

Speaker 3:          00:31:53       In that way. You almost see them as more of a Predator like the printer because psycho fucking Ted Bundy type sociopath. Well there's something about someone who is like really like projects, an image and the image is like the like the Cosby situation. Perfect example projects. This image of this wholesome, super squeaky clean family man who doesn't swear admonishes of the comedians for swearing using bad words, talking about sex gets really angry. Them calls them up. The famous Eddie Murphy bit where Bill Cosby calls him up and tells him to stop swearing and then he calls up Richard Pryor and Richard Pryor tells him did, did people laugh? Did you get paid? Tell bill to have a coke and a smile and shut the fuck up. Classic. Right. Well you do. And when the guy and Richard Pryor who's just fucking, everything's on the table, man, everything's on the table and scold.

Speaker 3:          00:32:45       Yeah. Light himself on fire. Comfortable to know where you stand with it. Yeah, that's my dog. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah man. If you're willing to go that far on that, then you're probably not hiding anything. There's nothing scarier than somebody hiding shit. Exactly when you think about it. But the interesting thing about the Cosby situation is that it's the accusations or date rape, which to me is, well I don't, wouldn't even say date rape. I would say rape and I would say, well the war, the worst kind of race, sorry, I was referring just to the drug. Right? Like it wasn't date rape in the sense that like uh, he, you know, he was on a date or whatever. Like he held him down like he did the difference in that. I'm not saying it's any different in, it's not any more excusable or anything like that.

Speaker 3:          00:33:30       I know. All, I'm all I'm saying is that, uh, trying to prosecute that, oh, your, your point is the, what's the woman, what's the story? What's the, the, the accusation. I was, I was completely cognizant. I woke up in somebody else's clothes, like I read her, her account, the original, uh, accuser who nobody was listening to at least for the first few years after the accusation. Uh, I woke up in his apartment, don't know how I got there and I was wearing his clothing and I was throwing up. That's the accusation, right? Right. Well, what a woman has to do, well, I shouldn't say I shouldn't put it on the woman, but the only way to prove is to immediately get a drug test, uh, call the cops. And you know, I mean, but a lot of women in those scenarios are fucking terrified and scared.

Speaker 3:          00:34:19       And not only that you're dealing with like way back into the 60s. And there was, you know, like what kind of drug tests were even available back then? We, what could they test for? How could they please? So the drug itself and that happening to people was so new. Right. I don't even know that somebody would, we would realize the steps necessary and maybe he had the gun. But imagine you're that. What was, she was like 18 at the time. You're her and you're, you want to make an accusation against bill fucking Cosby and nobody wants to listen to nobody. I mean, he's a giant superstar. I mean, he was a superstar in the 60s I believe his first TV show us in 65 I think I spy. I mean, he was an Emmy award winner a lot before I was born. Crazy. You know, and that, the thing that kills me though is that like, like this Ghomeshi guy, he was this like sweet guy. Like you, you, you saw him as this, you know the father figure on the Huxtables and he had this, you can never imagine that guy dropping Queloz into a chick's drank and just, it's so fucked up and it's almost more fucked up than if the allegations are like, let's pick a guy like old dirty bastard. You know what I mean? Rest, rest in

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       peace. But if old dirty bastard did something awful, you would go, well let's, you know, like I was shocked because you know where you stand with old dirty. Yeah, right, right. You meet old dirty or like I already get it man. You know, and not to say that he was a rapist, but yeah, it's, there is something creepy about, uh, you know the whole Ted Bundy character, how old dirty bastard is probably less likely to do that too, which is more fucked up. Right. He was probably a guy who just like, because women knew what you mean. Look at his gold grill. You knew what the fuck because the creepiest people are the best actors. Right, right. The creepiest people or the guy who talked to you on the radio like this and then get you alone and you fucking cotton punch in the face like, whoa.

Speaker 2:          00:36:19       You imagine and up. Especially if you're a woman and you're into those like emo dudes and you see him and you're like, oh, this guy is sweet, he's going to cuddle and I'll be able to get really close to him before we have sex. Know he's punching you in the head, stuff in your head under a pillow and tried to suffocate you itself. It must be such a mind fuck to be in that scenario after the fact. You know, to find yourself there and be like, wow, that was not expected. STANDUP citizen, we're assuming he did this by the way. I mean we don't to be careful. He's tried to sue the CBC, but he did. He dropped, dropped it. Well, if you drop it, I mean if you're suing and you're in the middle of the stuff he's charged now. He's charged now as of a couple of days ago.

Speaker 2:          00:36:59       So yeah, I mean he's not, he's not convicted yet, but there are a number of accusations on the table and that's gonna that can't bode well for him. Yeah. Oh, who the fuck knows what actually happened in that particular case? But what just drives me up the wall is that someone's capable of doing that. It's, it's, it goes back and is sort of a very loose way. It goes back to what we're talking about with Ferguson. It's like our real issue when it comes to any kind of a crime, any kind of a horrible scenario, is what turns a person into the type of person that can do that. What turns what turns a person into the type of kid. But whatever Michael Brown did, we know he robbed a store. We know there's a photo of him grabbing some guy by the neck. He's a giant guy.

Speaker 2:          00:37:46       We know that. He did that. Oh, so what could you have done that when you were 18 I couldn't have, I wasn't a violent person. I was violent and it's right in the sense of us fighting. But you had an outlet. But yeah, my outlet, I mean I was never, I never, I hadn't, I haven't even gotten into a scuffle since I was in high school. Like I've had z maybe one time I'm fear factor, but the one time I fear factor. I didn't even hurt the guy. I just grabbed him. I didn't do anything to him. I just, I thought he was gonna hit me the question. Yeah. The question is what makes a person like that? How much of it is nature nurture, so almost it's huge chunk of it is nurture, right? Huge chunk, but nature and nurture are combined because of epic, epic genetics and there's learned behavior there.

Speaker 2:          00:38:32       There's, there's tendencies that a child, if they're in the womb of a mother who was under extreme stress and duress, a woman who's, it lives in a horrible neighborhood of deals with violence in the home. A woman who's being beaten while she's pregnant, that child will have a higher propensity for violence like this is, there's all these studies that have proven this are being done to prove this you, everyone's on equal. If your parents are super sweet and in love with each other and super supportive and you grew up and you're in the womb of that mom and then there's this kid who's mom is getting beat up by the dad who is a junkie who comes home every three days and it's just chaos and violence and fear and crying. You're a D, you're growing up a different person. So if you're in that circumstance and you're part of a greater group of people who have also had that same experience coming up, are you really, do you really have the capacity to understand how your actions are affecting the entire picture?

Speaker 2:          00:39:30       That's a great question. That's the real question, right? That's the real question. The real question is isn't whether or not that cop shot that guy in in a just way. The real question is how? How do we stop a kid like that from being kid? Like how do we stop an angry young man from, from developing into a criminal? How do you intervene? Is it possible to intervene? Is it possible to intervene with counseling? Is it possible to intervene with education or is there some sort of a medical pharmaceutical alternative that's on the horizon? I mean, who the fuck knows what, what, what turns someone into what's, well, you know, fill in the blank. There's a million instances all across the country, every day of people committing violent crimes and it's, and it, and, and to be fair, it's not just this, this part of the populous.

Speaker 2:          00:40:22       It's not just somebody who came up, uh, without very much, well, that's why this Ghomeshi guys kind of fuss. I mean, or I remember the kid in Santa Barbara, the rich kid, yes. Who had had it out for women or whatever. I read, read some stuff for regarding him when that happened. So yeah, it can happen anywhere, but it's obvious that violence among particular communities is vastly more, uh, consistent. Yeah. Impoverished communities. It's just more stress, more stress, more violence, more poverty. Did you hear this hope that they found that Mcdonald's is spending significantly more money advertising important neighborhoods recently? Yeah, they did a study. They're like, I don't even remember what the percentage was. I hate quoting things that I don't have the data on. Maybe Jamie can look it up. Yeah, Jamie could. Um, but yeah, that maybe runs even deeper than this. Right? As you, I mean, you know the like how does, how does nutrition play into it? Right. And that's a good point. You know what I mean? Sugar is a big part of the Diet of poor people. I mean not just sugar but sugar in refined form, whether whether it's candy or soda, but also in terms of like breads and carbohydrates. It's all like an alcohol upon those things. Meat Processing, the sugar.

Speaker 4:          00:41:45       If you, uh, if you're a poor family and you can go to Mcdonald's and get a, you know, a bunch of meals for five bucks a piece and it's weird how, how many things are stacked against you. It's just weird like that the fund, the building blocks of human life like vegetables or whatever are, are, are not accessible to you. At least not, not in the same way as those other ready made meals. Like, cause you've got to cook them. You got to, the investment isn't just the amount of money that it costs. Cause I've seen those responses like well you know they could buy vegetables and this and that, but when you're working two jobs and you're a single parent and whatever else that the energy invested in actually turning that vege those vegetables into something your kids actually want. Is this it right here? Yeah. This is the disturbing ways that fast food chains disproportionately target black kids, specifically McDonald's. But it's a lot of Papa John's Popeye's and Mcdonald's in there. Sorry, I may have accused him.

Speaker 2:          00:42:48       Well they, they go where they can make the most money. I mean it's like a magnet attracts metal filings. Well how do you feel about that? Is this, is this acceptable? Well, sorry to put you on the spot. Here's the thing. In an ideal society, like if you Louis would like a big Mac, you should be able to buy a big Mac. I completely agree. No, that a big Mac is shit. You know, it's not good for you. But if you have to choose between going down the street to whole foods and getting a nice salad that's super healthy, nutrient dense or a big Mac, and you choose as an adult to go get a big Mac, that's one thing. But the, there's a big difference between that and children and you know, and, and, and people that aren't educated or people that are poor, I don't think that Mcdonald's or burger king has a responsibility.

Speaker 2:          00:43:39       Should they be able to advertise to miners? Two miners, she's, this show will do whatever they want as long as it's legal. I mean, look, if you want to serve your kid a cheeseburger, it should that be illegal. If your kid, okay, your five year old says, Daddy, I want a cheeseburger. Like, all right, well let's go in there and get a cheeseburger. Is that it? Should that be okay? And if that's okay. Why? I mean, if it's okay to go to an ice cream store, if it's okay to go to Baskin Robbins and get your kid in ice cream Sundae, which pretty much everybody does every now and again. But here's the,

Speaker 4:          00:44:08       here's what I'm getting at is that the, the developing mind is very susceptible, at least traditionally has been susceptible to this to advertising's ability to, to bypass the, the, the, the defense mechanisms that an adult brain has. Right? I know you want to sell me something, right? I know that big Mac looks fucking delicious. I'm going to come by it. Right, right, right. But

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       maybe the like longterm embedding them, embedding themselves in the psyche of people at a young enough age is somehow affecting their decision making far later into their lives. That is not just a simple discussion of, you know, an advertisement tomorrow and, and free choice tomorrow. Like how free are we actually when it comes to thinking, right? Yeah. Well it's very, it's a very complicated and complex situation because what is okay for one group is not okay for another, what is okay for adults discerning adults who are educated and aware. If you want to go get a snickers bar, you should be able to. But if, if that is all that's available in your community and you are young and starving and you don't have much money, then that's a real issue because like this kid needs nutrition and they're not getting it from a snickers bar or a big Mac.

Speaker 2:          00:45:27       And it would be interesting to, to, to attempt to investigate the consequences of that from a mental perspective. Like is it possible to have a fully developed mind living off snickers is not and I don't think so. Even if it's whether or not it's fully developed, it's not going to be optimized. No, that's for sure. No, and the effects of that at at, at a young age, so it's, it's not, it's not like it's an old thing from a human history perspective, like the food that would have been available, it may have been available more to the rich people than the poor people. But you're talking about roughly the same stuff, right? It comes out of the ground or are you or you kill a cow and whatever you got what you got. No. Well, I think what we really need with communities really need is community gardens and you know, it would also foster a massive sense of community if you had community gardens where like say if you live on a block, all you would need is one lot.

Speaker 2:          00:46:23       Okay. You know, you have a hundred homes on a block, one of them one lot with v feed. Literally a hundred homes. You would just have to grow it correctly, you know, stagger the food and have everyone do shifts. If you have a hundred families doing shifts in this, you know, one half acre a lot, I mean a half acre is a lot of land as far as like growing food. If you have access to water and seeds and all these, the, you know, the proper soil to for growing food, you could do an amazing thing with an area. When I was a kid, my parents were involved in, um, my stepdad was going to school, he was a computer programmer and he went back to school to become an architect. And when he changed careers, he, when he was going to school, he was involved at one point in time with some project at his university where they were, um, they had like a communal garden sort of a thing and everyone had to do like a shift.

Speaker 2:          00:47:19       And I remember this very clearly because I went with him one day and I got attacked by a goat. Fucking conti. Goats jumped after me and they had livestock at Guardian. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They were, they were milking goats and uh, it was a part of, I don't, I was about maybe eight at the time, maybe seven or eight. So I do not remember the exact extent of their duties are what everything but what everything was for. But I remember there was all sorts of different vegetables. They were growing and then they had some livestock, I think they were using. Goat's milk is particularly nutritious. Yeah. Very easy to digest as well. And it's an issue with babies. A lot of babies have a real hard time with cow milk. My daughter did. It should a really hard time drinking cow milk. But goat's milk is super easy to digest for whatever reason.

Speaker 2:          00:48:06       I don't know nutritionally bubs or whatever. But that idea, that concept of a communal garden, I mean first of all it could bring the community together and amazing way, you know where everybody's sort of working towards some sort of a universal goal and two, it could provide people with food that either don't need money to pay for if they can just, you know, if everybody has a shift that they have to do like hey, it's your shift to lay down manure or your shift to pick up, you know, the crops and document them. And if you have like, you know, a log book that everybody has to sign in and you know, today we picked 18 squash, we put them here, you know, let everybody know, send the word out. Squash is available to families, come and get some squash. You know, the Kale is grown to the point. We could pick it that that's all possible and not like economically prohibitive. And it would probably save a lot of people a lot of money.

Speaker 4:          00:49:01       I think that makes a lot of sense. Most definitely. But I think for me it's like you won, you wonder how much time plays into it, right? Because when you like what comes with money and wellbeing and growing up in a good community and whatever is his time, free time, free time, which is what allows not only uh, you know, things like that to exist, but also the ideas, you know, like the, the, the, the free format of communication and ideas. When you subtract time from people when they are getting paid, uh, you know, a fraction of whatever they get paid per person is getting paid per hour or whatever. It's there or you know, red lining there, their cape, their capacity, the, the age old work smarter, not harder type scenario. But it's like if, uh, if time is not abundant, it's hard to imagine that people would find a w what could find a way to participate in something like [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:50:06       is a guy named Ron Finley who's got a Ted talk on this very subject, right? He calls himself a guerrilla gardener. Wow. Yeah. He's got a Ted talk about guerrilla gardening and south central La and it's really interesting. Yeah. And he has, um, these, these gardens that he set up and like medians, like growing food

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       in all these places that where nothing was growing, but like weeds before only gets young kids involved in growing this food. And he's talking, you know, this ted talk, it's really interesting because he's, he's talking about how little it costs and how healthy it is and how good it is for you. Yeah. You know, it's, it's a really to get him on here, man. I got him. He's um, yeah, I mean he sounds like a bad if he has a, yeah. I wonder if he has a Twitter foe. I'm sure he was at Twitter. It's funny though that if this stuff is really as accessible as it seems, it is like ground Sun rain, right. Why the hell does it cost what it costs at whole foods? What's that about? Yeah. What is that about? I mean, I, when I got here and I was at the whole foods in Venice and Jesus Christ, that place is buzzing. It's a scene, man. It's, it's like, it's like you're, you're, you're in some wacky nutritional nightclub.

Speaker 3:          00:51:27       They kind of like a little wine bar and if people are sitting there talking, sipping on expensive wines, you know, buying the most expensive products you possibly can. It's very, it's like a rite of passage. It's like nutrition is a rite of passage as a place even more expensive called Erewhon who were been an Erewhon. No, that's a new one to the next level. Do they have a dress code? No, but whole foods is better though because whole foods has like a real butcher shop. Like whole foods. You can get like a fat rice and steak. Yeah, I saw that. Like good meat that, I mean they even had smoked brisket. Like they're smoking it right there in the supermarket cheese. There's a whole food in boulder that is like a God damn restaurant. I mean they have all sorts of, or they have a pizza oven?

Speaker 3:          00:52:11       Yeah, I have. They make sandwiches. They have all sorts of stuff. The one in Venice had the wood pizza oven too. I tried it. It was bad ass pizza. Like I'm not taking anything away from them. Better food for more people is awesome. Expensive though. That's what I'm saying. So it's hard, but price wise it's like, and I'm not trying to uh, be prejudice or anything, but that is a type of person that's in there. You know what I mean? I love how you said that. I'm not trying to be prejudice. Um, I it is prejudice Twitter page called yes, you're racist. Oh, okay. And uh, I was tweeting it the other day because it was a during the day of the riots, it was a great time to go to, yes, you're racist. And they would find like racist tweets and put them up. And the guy who runs the page was saying that that was the worst day ever.

Speaker 3:          00:52:56       Worst than Trayvon Martin or worse than any other that day. Well, there was so much, so much racist bullshit being tweeted. Wow. I mean, I believe it. I've been in the youtube comments before. It's, it seems like there'll be a way to, to mitigate a lot of the issues. And this also, it's, it's, it's also difficult to get people to fucking eat that shit. Like they want eat cheeseburgers. Right. You know, it's not as simple as a, do you want some more coffee man? Who wants to make small clubs? I would love some more. This is fantastic coffee. I'm just, it's, it's starting to sink in. I'm getting fired up now. We got plumbing, caveman coffee. Right. Perfect. Um, it's, it's hard to get people to choose a salad over a fucking ice cream, but I feel like it is prevailing. [inaudible] I mean, I don't know about when you were a kid or whatever, but nobody was saying Mcdonald's is bad for you.

Speaker 3:          00:53:47       Right. Nobody was saying cigarettes are bad for you. At some point in time, you know, at some point in time, doctors were prescribing things. Did you ever see that j Edgar Hoover film know Capria Oh no, I never saw it. It's a good movie. And one of the things in the movie was Leonardo Dicaprio or j Edgar Hoover's mom telling Leonardo Dicaprio that he should, you know, smoke the cigarettes that the doctor prescribed to make him heartier, you know, to make him more really prescribing cigarettes to make you like refer stronger. No. Yay. Yes. Doctors prescribed cigarettes. Yeah. Well, you know, before the, before the vibrator doctors would give yes. Hysteria, right? Yes, yes. Hysterical hysteria being connected to hysterectomy the, and you had to define me. That's signed a way to log it into the book. That's medical book. Yeah. It's like the connection hysteria and hysterectomy like that. That's where the word comes from wildly.

Speaker 3:          00:54:48       And these women, I mean I'm doing a butcher job of the definition of it, but these women would go to the doctor and the doctor would, uh, just finger blast though. That's the doctor would tell, you know, I mean with a cigarette in his mouth and then the origins of the word hysteria. Yeah, right. Probably right. Yeah. It's, it's, it's wild how much things can change in a short period of time. Yeah. And it's an, it's an accelerating thing as well. Uh, but I think we're, you know, we'll look back on this time and say, I can't believe we did that the same way we're looking back on 40 years ago or 30 years ago and saying, I can't, I can't believe we did that. So, uh, there's definitely a movement into the direction of, uh, getting back to the food thing into a direction of a more fulfilling diet.

Speaker 3:          00:55:36       Yeah. Hysteria. The describes unmanageable emotional excess. The fear that can be centered on a body part or most commonly on an imagined problem with that body part. Disease is a common complaint. Uh, see also body dysmorphic disorder and heal what I was reading or, no, sorry, listening to a podcast, uh, I think it was radio lab or I dunno, something like that. And they were talking about using a woman using a pms as a defense in a court case. Oh yeah. For, uh, for punching or hitting her kid or something, something like that. And, and how the implications of that on the legal system, whether or not, uh, whether or not you're psychologically there when you're experiencing that

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       hormonal imbalance that comes with that time of the month. Yeah. Well people have used sugar as defense for murder. Like yeah. Some guy use Twinkies eating Kate to make Twinkies and went crazy. I believe that was in northern California. Yeah, female hysteria. That's the the thing. I was looking for a once common medical diagnosis exclusively in women, which today no longer recognized by medical authorities as a medical disorder. It's diagnosis and treatment where routine for many hundreds of years in western Europe and one of the things they would do, they would blast water on a woman's pussy. There's, there's a photo, if you go to the Wikipedia for the, look at that cannon fire hose, there's blast and note how her legs are together and down. Meanwhile she'd be like grabbing the back of her knees yet outta here. It would just be flooding. Look at that wedding chair that doesn't look like it's ready for that kind of force.

Speaker 2:          00:57:21       I know it should be like some sort of a captain's chair like a captain Kirk had in the enterprise that's going to tip over and they will like. You see how the doctors keeping his distance ways he's firing that from a fair distance. The physician in 1859 claimed at a quarter of all women suffer from hysteria. One physician cataloged 75 pages of possible symptoms of hysteria and called the list incomplete. Almost any Aleman could fit the diagnosis. Physicians thought that the stresses associated with modern life cause civilize women to be both more susceptible to nervous disorders and to FAU to develop faulty reproductive tracks. What they just fucking gas back then. It's really amazing when you go back just you know a couple hundred years and you look at like the connections they had to disorders and diseases. They just guessed they were so off. Yeah, they didn't know what the fuck they were talking about. It's false. It's not true. Oh is that Snopes? But didn't some guy actually use something like sugar as a defense? Sugar as a defense. I'm sure some hot shot lawyer has attempted to use. What does he say? Anything to say? It never happened.

Speaker 5:          00:58:36       Uh, recently resigned. Uh, tweak your defenses over common. They recognized term. It says he got off with voluntary manslaughter. Defense argued the refined sugar and is junk food made them depressed it mentally incapable of premeditated murder.

Speaker 2:          00:58:57       Well, no, this, listen, this was an actual defense and he tried to use his defense was that he suffered diminished capacity as a result of depression. His change in die from healthy food to Twinkies and other sugary food was said to be a symptom of depression. So contrary to popular belief, his attorneys did not argue that Twinkies were the cause of the actions, but at the consumption was symptomatic of an underlying depression. So it was like confusing. So like he's deep, he's depressed. Look, heats all these 20, you must be depressed, depressed, and that's why he killed somebody. It wasn't that the Twinkies were causing him to kill some money. The Twinkies, we're just a consequence of his depression. Twinkies. Apparently we were never mentioned the courtroom during the trial, nor the defense ever claim that white was on a sugar rush and committed the murders as a result, however one report, his use of the term twinkie defense caught on and stuck.

Speaker 2:          00:59:48       That's people in a nutshell and that's me. I'm perpetrating it. Fucking keeping the ignorant chain rolling. It's funny how stuff like that works, you know? I mean essentially a lot of that is going on in Ferguson. Like someone gets an idea and then like my hands are up, don't shoot. Like they're pretending that this kid said my hands are up. Don't shoot. It's like people keep saying hands up, don't shoot, hands up, don't shoot. And then it's a better story. Witnesses that made testimony, the indictment there were saying that he rushed the cop and then he said, you know you too much of a pussy to shoot me. Who the fuck knows what really happened? It's just, that's not the sexy story. Exactly. Cops need to wear fucking cameras, you know? And a couple cops have argued with me about this online. Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:00:34       Saying that they don't think they should. Yeah. They were saying like, you know, do you have much more to go with calls but fuck off. How much is it go pro fuck off. You can get one for 150 bucks. Jesus Christ, you got fucking so much money is being a four K GoPro right now. So much money's being invested in the war on drugs. So much money's being invested in Afghanistan. I rack and just feeling the fucking blanks. Corn subsidies, I mean Jesus Christ, the amount of money that's being, do you ever watch king corn? The amount of money that's being invested in making sure that Mcdonald's still has fucking corn syrup. There's a lot of money going around folks. And the idea that someone who carries a fucking gun, that it's not a good idea to put a camera on them. Right? For all sorts of reasons.

Speaker 2:          01:01:18       Look, if that kid was saying on camera, you're too much of a pussy to shoot me and Juan and towards that cop and the cop shot him, we're good. We're done. This whole thing is done. So right now we're dealing with a lot of speculation and we have a bunch of people that are walking down the street and mass closing down freeways. Say yelling out, hands up, don't shoot. What's the cost of that now? How the fuck do we even know that? That was sad, like what are you doing? And like that black guy that are on Twitter was saying to the white rapper, you are blind to the facts in your attempt to be down. And there's a lot of that going on. There's a lot of track people. They want the narrative, they want the narrative, they want it to fit in with their idea of you know, what, what is just or what is exciting or what's really going on.

Speaker 2:          01:02:05       The other thing about the camera too is it's not just about what would have been captured, it's about what might not have happened. Well, there's a I p I tweeted a story or a tweeted a study rather about California that said that when they made cops where cameras that numbers of complaints against cops, the numbers of violent incidents and, and, and abuse dropped dramatically. When people are accountable, they don't fuck up on both sides. Both sides on both sides. If you are, if you're somebody who's committing a crime or not or whatever, you understand the consequences of that camera. Yes. That what you're about to say and do. There's a record of it and the cop knows he can't get away with anything. Both parties. Now you know what they should do if they find a cop tampered would fucking camera, they should put him in jail for 20 years and find a cod or erased footage or that purposely, if they can prove that a cop purposely fuck with a camera, there should be a high consequence.

Speaker 2:          01:02:59       Know what though? There's a way around that you could have it, uh, uploading streaming in real time. Yeah. You know, like, have you heard it? Do you have one of those drop cams or have you heard of them? You got to have heard of them. Yeah. So like set them up in five minutes. They're like this big, they connect to the wifi network and then boom, you're, you're streaming probably would be if you were in a place that was remote, you know, if you were in the Maine Woods or something like that, if you know ry fucking game warden or something, abusive cops could get away with it if there was no signal, but right. I mean if you had some sort of a fail safe mechanism where the, the data is being backed up by a Bluetooth, you know, to the hard drive of the patrol car, you know, or some sort of a signal that reaches the hard drive of the patrol car and it can't be tampered with.

Speaker 2:          01:03:41       Right. That doesn't seem to me to be outside of the realm of possibility. That would be great for everybody. Great for the cops and fantastic for civilians. I mean, I, I guarantee you that alone would cut back on police abuse dramatically. Would you per, so you get pulled over for speeding, right. You want the cop coming up in recording that? Yes. Really? Sure. Okay. Why not? I don't know. Some, there is some kind, there is a, uh, a feeling that being recording recorded as a negative thing, like the whole, you know, NSA type thing. But maybe it's different because you know you're being recorded. Yeah. You know, you're being recorded and you being recorded because you violated a law. Okay. Let's say you didn't go well then you say, I didn't violate the law, right? Whatever you say it on camera. Right. So some people would have a hard time asserting themselves, which would be an issue cause socially some people a bit more awkward.

Speaker 2:          01:04:37       That can be an issue. But I think that if someone comes up to you and talks to you about a crime and you know you're being recorded, I mean it's gotta be a lot of transparency there. Like if you were speeding and they have the evidence and they have all the data, I mean that's all the only thing that would be a problem as people wouldn't be able to get off for being cute or having a crying story or a girl with big tits. Yeah. Well and what percentage of traffic infractions you do actually end up getting convicted for the whole, the whole thing. Like there's no leniency there. And the amount of blow jobs at college receive would dramatically,

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       that's the real reason, right? I know a cop, well I don't know a cop rather, I know a girl who got pulled over by a cop and the cop said, look, it might be some other way we can take care of this. And she was like, what the fuck are you talking about? The cop went back to his car, wrote her a ticket and fucking centered on her way. You know, like he was been going on for as long as it's been cops. I'm sure he's floating it out there. Oh look, my zippers on done. Oh, your mouth is right there. Yeah, I mean it's been done. It's not like the first, I mean, how many times it has a girl offered. He's probably, a lot of girls are offered that. I don't know. I'm sure. You know. The thing is though, human beings cameras.

Speaker 3:          01:05:57       Why I was watching this thing the other night, um, and maybe you've heard of it called surveillance man. No, you heard of this. He recently got all these shit pulled off youtube. Uh, but this guy goes around and just records people. Regular people walks up to you, records you and puts it online and, and whatever. He edits it together and puts it on Youtube. Well that's Kinda fucked up. Take this very fucked up. That's it's, it's very fucked up. Is he a creep? I wouldn't know who. We know who the guy is. No idea. So he doesn't put himself on that ever. Fuck that guy. So he walks up to people and gets, uh, various responses. Some people, like he walks up to chew, all this stuff got pulled off youtube, but it's on live leak now. He walks up to two Mormons, the ones that go door to door and they're super polite.

Speaker 3:          01:06:49       They're like, whoa. They're like, oh, you're recording. And it's whatever. Like they have a nice conversation and they walk off. But then other people, they're trying to knock them out. But I think it's so, it's so interesting how the camera in and of itself almost has this social view of, of like, like a weapon in a way. It's like you're pointing that thing at me because you're attempting to take, the person's not doing anything wrong by pointing the thing. No, no, no. I mean the person that's getting recorded, you're not doing anything wrong. Why does it make us feel so uncomfortable? You're opening up a door for a bunch of other people to enter into your life. If you take a guy like I take a camera on you. Yeah, I don't know you, I find you, I take a camera and you know, and I put it on a youtube channel that has a million subscribers like yours.

Speaker 3:          01:07:35       Does he, let's say the person doesn't know that when they're being recorded. Okay. Dot. Right? Like if you're out in the street, probably doesn't count for you because somebody might know who you are and what in that case. But if you're a regular everyday person and someone walks up to you with their smartphone and they're just a few feet away from you, recording you that like that's what he's doing. He's not announcing that it's going to be on youtube, but people's reactions are intense. Yeah. Shouldn't be into his phone. It's still is fun. Kick him in the Dick. Fuck that. But maybe he wins. He wins that way. He wins the how's he win? Cause I stole his phone. No, because that's a way, because that's a way better clip if you don't get it, if you don't get that phone, oh, I'll get his phone. Let me get his phone.

Speaker 3:          01:08:18       Well, whatever you may, you may be more gifted than others who fail in his clips to get it from him. Is he like a sprinter while he's, he, he starts to get what he, he moves away at the right time. This guy's crazy. He interrupts like, uh, he, he, there are cases where he walks behind the cash register at Mcdonald's and starts recording people that are like making burgers and they're just like, what the fuck? Or in certain cases it's like he know he walks, he walks into like a um, a card game that's going on private card game and he's recording it. Like he takes risks to, to get that footage. But I agree with you, fuck that guy. But at the same time I think it sort of unveils something about humanity and how we're not completely ready for a fully recorded future.

Speaker 3:          01:09:04       We're not completely ready, but I feel like it's kind of inevitable. I think there's almost nothing to stop it from. I mean if you look at where things are going, you look at what was our access to information just a hundred years ago. What is, what is our access to information going to be like a hundred years from now, fully streaming everything fully streaming. Now I'm, I'm a big believer in that we're going to be sharing our lives that our lives going to be like, like, you know, I can go to your Facebook and look at your pictures and I think there's going to be a time where you're going to be able to read my fucking thoughts because my thoughts are going to be recorded on a hard drive and HD or my instead of my thoughts, whether my life, what I see, you know, the experiences that I have. And then from there it's probably going to be even more complex and complicated.

Speaker 3:          01:09:49       There's going to be some sort of a mechanism for a re-introducing emotions into an outside observer. Like I could find out whether or not you cried when you went to the movies. I'll watch a movie through your perspective. I mean, that might be a channel that you go to. Let's watch movies with Louis. Yes. You know, and like, Oh my God, Avatar 16 just made me cry. And I'm like, oh, he's crying like you were, you know, like you see it through your eyes. I could like see what you like to masturbate too and how, what, what excites you. But that's all it totally inevitable. But if you asked anybody to flip that switch tomorrow, it's like you're not going to be on the front lines. I don't know about all. Oh, you would, you're ready to broadcast 24 seven. I don't, not me, but I think a lot of people would jump right?

Speaker 3:          01:10:33       The phone. You have people on Youtube who almost do that. They upload a Vlog every day. Let's say. I like how you said that Vlog Vlog. I usually call it v log. Oh, okay. Vlog. Well, because it was pulled from blog. Right. But uh, and I, I sit there and I look at that and I'm like, damn, I am so happy that that's not me. That's not what I have to do. Well, you, you're a content based guy. You're, you're doing videos at unbox therapy based on your review of particular items, objects, things. Yeah. So people are tuning in, not, I mean partially for a glimpse into my life, but not, I'm not expected to create content out of my experiences 24 seven right. Whereas like I feel like a bloggers in this and this kind of space, not everybody, but some where they're trying to turn, I'm going to be not even consciously trying, but once you broadcast everything you do, how can it not become a performance?

Speaker 3:          01:11:31       How can it not be what you mean? Yeah. Well that was hunters Thompson a argument when they were filming him way back when he was doing one of his early documentaries and they did on him. He was saying that you're, you know, you're not going to really get it. Like that camera that you're putting on me changes the interaction 100% exactly. And that's what I was trying to get at with the whole, the whole thing before about the cop carrying the camera or the surveillance guy or whatever is like, are you you when a camera's on? Yeah. Well eventually you are potentially your you when the camera's on, what does that mean? I'm you now hear me now? No, I'm mean now. You mean now when the camera's on? Are you? Yes, like this camera on me as deep man. But I do, I do this so often.

Speaker 3:          01:12:19       I know in a podcast, like if you and I were having this conversation, the only difference would be I wouldn't be feeling these fucking things on my ears. Yeah. I mean it may be, but here's a bigger, quite personal information. Here's a bigger question. Are you the same? Me Too. Everybody not to people that I don't know if they might have like ulterior motives or they might be creepers or there might be weird, like there's people about certain things. Sometimes you're sitting in that chair and I'm sure I don't remember. One doesn't come to mind, but the guy across from you, you're not. You know what I mean? There's not a connection. Like it could be a, I don't know if you, maybe not if you disagree with that, but you must have had conflict before in this environment changed the you that you were most certainly me.

Speaker 3:          01:13:06       But you also would have, I mean any conflict outside of this environment. If you had conflict with someone and you want to trademark it would change who you were and how you interacted with them. You would be more guarded. You'd be like, Oh, this guy's a creep. Yeah. Yeah. See The you the, this is like deep shit. But like, but no, but seriously, I don't know that you can be the same person around everybody. Yeah. I think I know we all, I think we all do some kind of editing. Right? Well and not only that, I mean, isn't that kind of what being a human being is? We are, part of what we are is we are who we become when we're around other people. Yes. One of the reasons why we like being around certain people, they make us better. Yes. Interesting. And it made me agree with that.

Speaker 3:          01:13:52       They make you more fun or they make you more kind or they make us where we're not totally autonomous, we're just not. No, not, we're not completely individuals. We are individuals interacting with under individuals and those ingredients of these other individuals provide, they change who we are. That's it's important not to hang around with negative p. Yes, I had a friend who's a nice guy, but fucking dude was like, he, he always was involved in drama and bullshit. And when I was around him, like I remember thinking like this fucking guy, like everything in his life is always a mess. And when I'm around him I become a mess. Like when I'm around him, I'm arguing with him and when I'm not around him, everything is calm and his life remain. Koi. I stopped hanging around with them really slick way back in the day, but I stopped hanging around with him and his life just became more and more chaotic in mind.

Speaker 3:          01:14:45       Became peaceful because of it, because I eliminated this one, like super problematic dude from my life. But I have other people that I hang around with them and it's always fun. Yeah. You know, I hang around with them. It's always laughs and joking. It's always a good time and you feel better when you're around them. You become a better person. I think we collectively, at least sometimes for me, like we underestimate the importance of this stimulus. Yeah. The people that are around us, the things that we surround ourselves with. Like Facebook recently did something controversial. Um, I don't know how recently, but they started auto playing videos as you scroll through and you know that the, some of the shit that's out there you don't want to see. Yeah. Right. Yeah, I know. I definitely don't, I don't play sucks in general. It sucks in general.

Speaker 3:          01:15:34       But I guess what I'm getting at more with this one is it's like the Internet opens up this door to see as much as you want, right. And to, to use your eyeballs. You get in a metaphorical sense as like the vein to insert the drug. And so I don't, I don't know that we are collectively aware of the fucking heavy duty consequences of that, that the web, the web giving us everything is, that's the best thing about the web. But it's also the worst thing about the web in that you're changed forever. You watch a guy's head get chopped off, you're different. It's true. It's true. There's no, there's no going back. You've seen it. You know what that looks like. I mean, up until I was in my twenties I didn't know what it looked like when the guy got his head sought off by a buck knife.

Speaker 3:          01:16:28       You know it's right. Then you see it and you go, oh Jesus Christ. And I remember I can still to this day remember I think the first time I ever saw like faces of death, same and to this day I was way too young to see that. Yeah, I would just remember like the weird like tightening of your body. Like the, the intent me ask you this. Do you wish that you hadn't seen it? No. No. I'm fine now. Well, I mean I've seen them now. It doesn't make me a worse person. Just it is what it is. I know what it is now. No, it's like you don't go out of your way to watch more of it. No, I do not. I avoid it. These recent ones with these journalists that would be headed by the isis guys. I. I. W I avoided all of them because you need, the objective of those guys is to attract your eyeballs.

Speaker 3:          01:17:16       I don't need to experience that. I know what it looks like. I know what's going on. I don't need to express, but I do know I did watch one cause I couldn't believe it was on fucking youtube. Somebody sent me a link to it on Twitter, something about isis and I was like, what? So I clicked on it thinking, this is a youtube link. This is not going to be anything serious. It was a full on execution. Them cutting their heads off. Both Youtube and Twitter are having difficulty keeping it down because of the speed at which it's being replicated in re uploaded. These guys from a social media perspective are fairly educated that you hear the guy's voice, he's got an English accent. It's like these are not who we think they are. Right? Right. We think of them as being an uneducated savages are unaware who were living in caves.

Speaker 3:          01:18:01       That's when that, and that was the narrative for so long. Yeah, that that's what that was about. But it's interesting how people subtract themselves from the overall equation like, and by that I mean that by watching it, you're a perpetuating it sort of, yeah. Being away. Yeah, because the entire objective from an Roi, this sounds gross to say it this way, but from an Roi perspective, Roi, return on investment from a return on investment perspective, Isis has mad legs via one dude. What's the cost? The one dude, right. That's the scary part is that the Internet has allowed for the proliferation of a piece of content, an idea, something that all of us collectively recognize as negative but can't keep our fucking eyes off. Whether it was something that someone tweeted [inaudible] who's a part of Isis. We was talking about how everybody gets crazy when one person's body part gets removed.

Speaker 3:          01:19:05       But meanwhile a hundred people get blown to bits. Yeah. By a robot. There you go. No one says a word. There you go. It's hard to argue with that. I mean, I'm not supporting isis, but it's hard to argue with that logic. Like we have some weird ways of looking at loss. Somebody tweeted me the other day, um, that there was an objective to kill 40 people and they wound up killing 1,417 people in their attempt to kill these 40 people. Like that's a lot of fucking murder for no reason. I mean that those other people that collateral damage, those people have families, those people have lives. Those people had friends, those people had lovers. All on these were gone. So long as those people on TV speak a different language and wear a different outfit and look different than us. Buya Bulia choose. Let's do it. Yeah. And the all that is affecting us all that's changing us.

Speaker 3:          01:20:00       Just like having negative people in our life. Just like communicating with shitty people. Just like being in a bad neighborhood, all that is your reality. You are a combination of your reality and your take on that reality. This membrane here like is not nearly as strong from a structural perspective as we like to believe it is. Yeah, no shit. Right. That's what I was saying with the, with the fast food thing in, in uh, targeting black people in black neighborhoods and kids and this and that. It's like the informational world. We just don't view it like torpedoes or heroin or whatever, but the consequences are very similar. Like when you let shit in, it changes you. Like we both just said emotionally, how is it you can watch this thing that you know already happened, right? Like how I can't change what happened there. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:20:50       When when a guy gets his head chopped off, there's literally nothing that I can do about it. So it might as well be fiction at this point. It might as well be Hollywood at this point, but it's not, I watch it and I know the difference and I can't steer clear of it. I can't escape that high. Yeah. You can't escape that input. I mean, we are essentially a product of our input. Yes. Our interactions, our input and how we, how we process all of it. That's, that's what we are, that's what makes a person, a person. That's why people that have lived color for lives are so interesting is because they have so much input. There's so much variety in their input. Right? Yeah. And when we all become connected and some sort of a weird hive mind way. Yeah. Is it, is everybody more fucked up than we think?

Speaker 3:          01:21:46       There's a lot more fucked up shit than we think. Yeah. I think we based a lot of our ideas of reality on media. Yup. On, when I say media, I mean like fictional depictions of pain songs. Coldplay songs. Yeah. And there's a lot of women to think dudes are like the guy who Coldplay song don't, please don't. I have a whole like tangent on Rom coms about how like what's a Romcom romantic comedy, how no self respecting dude should ever take his girlfriend, wife to any of those movies. Those move, that's fucking terrorism right there. Give me an example, Jennifer Aniston movies when she was like a cop, that shit, every fucking time it's selling one thing. The grass being greener always Amy, you're the fucking, you're the current lawn. You know what I mean? You're in a current fucking line and you're taking your, you're taking like, it's crazy to think that, oh, we're just going to enjoy it and we're going to laugh and whatever this and that.

Speaker 3:          01:22:53       There is no Romcom. There is no, no, none of that structure without the triangle. The Love Triangle and the love triangle opens the door to the third party. See, we don't work that way dudes. For the most part, we're like stimulated by other shit as you know. But on that side of the fence, it's all imagination. It's all like, yeah, the fucking pool boy or the the delivery man or whoever. Someone's always going to treat you better or whatever it is. And as you know, anytime you're in a, in a, in a relationship, you learn really quickly that, I think we talked about this last time about, you know, the, the honeymoon phase and how things change and that's just part of growing and, and whatever. But in those movies it's never about that. It's never about, oh look, they've been together forever and they still fucking doing it.

Speaker 3:          01:23:46       Right. It's always some prettier dude has to come along. [inaudible] you're a fucking idiot if you're taking your wife to that shit. Okay. What should you take her to I planet of the Apes, Dystopia fucking version of reality where gorillas become sentient and they start getting machine guns and shooting white people may mean that what we need. No, maybe not that. I don't know. I don't know either. I don't know how to solve that shit, but all I gotta say he's don't participate, but what have you enjoyed them? No, you don't. No. No. It's not a chance. It's fucking impossible. Ryan Gosling movies, no way.

Speaker 3:          01:24:22       Drive maybe, which I haven't seen and tells him 21 jump street one. Who's the Guy Tatum? That guy, that handsome bastard. What about him? Fuck 'em all man woe. I take it back chatting. I didn't mean it. You gotta do what you gotta do. And if you know, if I look like that, I'd probably do the same goddamn thing. But truthfully, like it's, it's, it's, it's weird how much we turn our lives into the stories that we want them to be. Well, we've definitely pretend we definitely pretend. And the, the, the, the other issue is that when that's a part of the input of reality, your drawer you're dealing with like faulty data, you're dealing with like fictional accounts, rive reality, the fucking glitch. A bunch of writers sat down. They were in a room, they worked for weeks lines. That would sound absolutely ridiculous in the real world.

Speaker 3:          01:25:11       Music plays when the guy delivers some, his head is 60 feet tall. He's on a giant fucking screen. The perfect words, his features are perfectly symmetrical. Everything is wonderful. So Dreamy. Yeah, I mean look, think about like what they can do in movies. Now Look, how about the movie 300 those guys didn't even really look like that. Like, I remember when I saw that dude, Gerard, whatever the fuck his name is, Butler. Yeah. In real life. And I was like, oh, look at this fucking flabby because I couldn't handle that movie. Really? No. Why is that? It was too far beyond the realm of what I was willing to accept. I feel the same way about a lot of Zombie Shit. You know, I was watching, I was like sorta off the walking dead for a while. I watched the first season and then, you know, I dunno, it got old for me because of the zombies stopped being as, as they were early

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       on. Right. If they're all slow and shit now. Yeah. You know, and it's like, well fuck, I don't know. I want the zone. I want a dangerous zone. You want a 28 days later, Zombie love 28 days later. If I need to be afraid of something like second nature for them, you know, to, to kill them now. But anyway, I'm watching that shit and it's like, oh, the girls look fucking awesome. They got makeup, they got makeup. They're, they're, they're prepped up. I want to see the Real Zombie movie. People look like shit. Well fuck it. All of Hollywood needs to tone down the appearance. I that my suspension of disbelief in my enjoyment of all of Hollywood is being hindered by the fact that they can't put normal looking people in stuff. I was watching the Jurassic Park trailer this morning. Looks Wild. It looks wild, but at the same time I'm thinking shit's hitting the fan, this and that and the fucking eyeliners perfect.

Speaker 4:          01:26:58       The bugs you. It bugs the shit out of me. How can anyone get excited about that as a film maker like you at all costs? Want this person to suspend disbelief and pretend they were there for a minute? Well, beautiful women sell movies. God beautiful people. So movies, I don't agree with that. You come in the walking dead. No one grows a fucking beard. Hell yeah. You know? Hell, you grew a beard, Rick. That's it. He's the only one everybody else has shaved out loud. It doesn't make for a good billboard. Does that what else? No one's growing. No one's like hairs growing all fucked up and scraggly. Their hair stays the same length for years. Same thing as the makeup. They make certain concessions to be more glossy. Well, if you paying attention to this recent season, there's a woman in the recent season that always has fucking lipstick on and there you perfectly, perfectly like clean and press suit.

Speaker 4:          01:27:48       This is fucking ridiculous. What self respecting person can accept that in their content? Come on. If you watch movies from back in the day before, shit got all glossy. You had people that looked like regular people, they'd be cast leading role. Teeth weren't perfect. Like who? Give me an example. I don't know if you watch old Scorsese movies like mean streets and shit like that. People had big noses, you know, I mean, you don't even need a specific exam, watch anything from 30 years ago. And it's like wow. Either, but that fucks with people's perception of what now actually is and what they need to do to participate in that whole thing. Uh, from an appearance standpoint, it's like a, when you put so much emphasis on the superficial stuff, everything else like gene Hackman, right? Yeah. That's a bad motherfucker. That motherfucker right there. There you go.

Speaker 4:          01:28:38       There's many examples of it, George. See Scott. There you go. You know who came to mind when I originally thought of an ugly, like right now, trying to think of a straight up ugly and no offense to this individual, but a straight up ugly leading man Gerard Depardieu right. But that's kind of like have French thing and gone though. He's gone. He disappeared, he vanished and he left a France. He doesn't even live in France anymore. Gerardi Pardot because of this country. Didn't want to pay. He drinks like six bottles of wine. It's a stick of butter every time the lights you see he's winning. That's fine. I'm cool with that. But as far as like that, that uh, penetrated my force field for content wise, uh, when Steve Buscemi got the leading role on a boardwalk empire, right. I was like, see you guys famous though.

Speaker 4:          01:29:30       If you break through, if you find a way through it, that's what I need. That's what I'm saying, but try and find another dude from an like, he looks like a creepy dude. Right. He gives he, and I'm sure he knows this because he gets cast in those roles all the time, so I'm not breaking any news here, but for him to have the ability to sort of be the face of an entire piece of like, uh, the people are better looking on even the Zombie Shit right now. The walking dead. Even then he was in the gangster. They could have cast somebody better looking, but they chose him. He looks like a real guy that I would encounter. Yeah. There are a lot of beautiful people and then fucking walking dead show. That's what I'm saying. The the pretty girl that has the Asian boyfriend, she just, she never gets scraggly looking.

Speaker 4:          01:30:13       She was, looks well fed her outfits like eyesight, this outfit. You've got to remember I came, I was watching the first season. Now I'm just starting again right now. I'm looking at her outfits. I mean, it looks like that could be in a magazine right now. You know, that's sort of like dirty, like look like a, she went hiking. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Like the sock goes above the boot just a little bit. You know, it's like, it's way too thought out. I want to see fucking mayhem. Well, that's the thing about 28 days later as opposed to like a television show, 28 days later was fucking dark. And the monsters, the zombies, they were so much more terrifying. 100%. It was a much more realistic scenario, much closer. And I was having this Zombie discussion with, uh, with some people that I was watching with and we were trying to think about realistic, Realistic Zombie movies and we couldn't even, besides 28 days later, and it doesn't even make sense to say realistic because there are no zombies.

Speaker 4:          01:31:08       But I mean, closer to our interpretation of what that might look like. Well, if we considered the different diseases that exist in nature, the does the different parasites to takeover bodies, the different, I mean there are some incredible parasite host relationships in nature that are absolutely real. Yeah. You know, uh, back to another podcast I was listening to about this, the patient zero for for aids and well yeah that was radio lab. Yeah. I listen to that well and it made the leap from like a perfect storm. Well, the crazy thing is that it happened in the early 19 hundreds, right? It happened. They use the cut a hunter scenario, so at the hunter killed a chimp and the chimp had killed two different forms of monkey in each one of those monkeys had a different amine deficiency virus. That's right. And viruses combined

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       and made the jump to a person. Yup. They were basically required the both of them to be able to replicate in a fashion that was, that they were capable because the immune system is actually fairly sophisticated in both apes and us that we'll find, find these kinds of issues and wipe them out. But this combination of the two of them had all the necessary information to build this super virus. But, uh, I, when I was listening to that, I was like, man, any first of all, why the fuck are people killing and eating apes? That's a bad move. They've always been doing that. I know it's happened forever. No, but you say it's a bad mood, but when you're starving, wow, they'll kill and eat anything. Right. I Dunno if you're GE so that genetically similar consuming that tissue that's like, they think it's problematic.

Speaker 3:          01:32:51       Yeah, sure. But I mean, you know that chimps, regular consume monkeys, it's a huge part of their diet. They do. Well that's fucking crazy. It's so crazy. They prefer the organs. So they eat the organs first, which means they're eating the monkey, the alive, right? Like they grab the monkeys and they eat them organs first. There's a crazy fucking video of these chimps and they set up this very sophisticated hunting strategy where they have chimps that are like running forward that are like pushing these monkeys towards these other champions. And then they come in from the sides too. And the capture and the trees and they have this chimp grabbing, this monkey is called [inaudible] monkey and the monkey screw marine and the chimp is eating. I'm from the hips first, just chill alive and the monkey just screaming and the look in his face, it's so human like and so is the chimp.

Speaker 3:          01:33:43       It's really hard to watch. But that's the harsh reality of of the jungle. You know? There's just, and people live there too and they've always been shooting monkeys. Yeah, he's a new, listen, that radio lab, I know that there's a new virus that made a jump from a gorilla to a person, a guy who shot and killed a gorilla and has this, there's a new like patient zero that they were discussing. Like if you wanted to find a patient zero. There's a guy that's infected with an immune deficiency virus that came directly from a gorilla. Hmm. What does that tell us about us though? I not us. It's them. I know, but it really freaked me out when I first, when I first saw or heard about that. I remember vividly when I, when I first found out about chimps killing other chimps are killing other a monkey monkeys. Things that were really similar to them to, to eat for food, whatever, like that animal developed as a carnivore or a omnivore. Right? Chimps. Yeah. Like what, what, what is it, what, where, where along the lines did they start eating other animals? Just vegetate forever. Yeah. I mean probably with chimps probably from the moment they became, I mean, the

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       idea of being that animals, I think the current theory is there was climate change and that um, some form of primates experimented with different food sources. That's why some primates are still primary, primarily vegetarians, but the more intelligent ones were the ones that started experimentally. Yeah. Because they had to to for two reasons. It's, it's also one of the theories that is bandied about when they tried to figure out why human brains develop so quickly. Like the human brain size doubled over a period of 2 million years, which is apparently like the greatest mystery in the entire fossil record according to some biologist. And one of the things they attributed to might be the switch and diet or from a strictly prep, not just protein but resources. Because in changing from a strictly plant based diet, your digestive system had to work less hard because it wasn't processing as much cellulose and there was more, more resources available to think about how to get these monkeys in, eat them or how to get these bugs or how to find these rodents or whatever the fuck they were eating and killing.

Speaker 2:          01:36:07       And then also the more intelligent animals were more effective. So the more the animals that were more clever, they'd figured out how to use tools if figured out hunting strategies. Those are the ones that were more effective in eating meat. And it was sort of a combination like a perfect storm, like having less resources to deal with processing the cellulose and the plant fiber. And so you're the, the internal organs actually changed and altered over the period of time. And in having less resources necessary to digest this plant matter, the uh, animal had more resources to grow its brain. Wow. Yeah, I saw a lot of weird shit that's, it has to take place for many, many years to develop development and so on and so forth. But yeah, I just, I don't know for me when to see them in that kind of environment to see how savage they could become and to know that that's our closest relative.

Speaker 2:          01:37:00       Like when everybody ever, anybody talks about us sort of transcending our apelike past and becoming far more intelligent and not fucking killing each other anymore. You, you, if you look to your closest relative relative their violence, hell, that's true. But isn't there like a spectrum when you think about like, okay, there's the people that live in the jungle that eat bushmeat bushmeat being the, you know, they'll eat anything, they'll eat chimps. Gorillas is those people that are eating that bushmeat. But then there's also people here in America that are primarily vegetarian and they're concerned with their impact, their carbon footprint, and they're concerned with animal cruelty that, you know, they use only if they have, if they do eat meat, it's organically sourced the free range chickens for their eggs. It's like a more, more of a movement towards kindness then for sure than the monkeys and chimps that are living that hard scrabbled jungle.

Speaker 2:          01:37:57       Oh, there's no doubt that were gentler than that. And we're moving more towards it being gentle in general. So I mean that's, that's the spectrum, right? Isn't that the spectrum? The people that are in the jungle still, they're the ones that are still eating the monkeys. Right. Very few people go on hunting trips to go get monkeys, but that's but dope. But that shit's been a source of, uh, some of the world's most intense diseases. Sure. AIDS, Ebola, whatever, whatever it is. Also prions, they carry, if you eat chimp brains, they carry very similar prions to the prions that like you get from like mad cow disease. Yeah. So it's like, I dunno, aids where does it, they were able to find patient zero, but like where does it actually come from? You know what I mean? Almost like nature's way of making the most savage amongst us evolve because it kills them off force.

Speaker 2:          01:38:46       Forced evolution. You think about what AIDS is. I mean, people would say you aids is God punishing the Queens, right? Well, maybe not, but maybe it's nature's way of punishing people that eat similar animals to what they are. Yeah. And eating intelligent animals that are closely related to you in some strange way is how you develop those diseases. And one of the big ones is mad cow disease comes from people forcing fucking cows to eat them. How brains, humans in New Guinea especially, uh, uh, cannibals in New Guinea have been observed having the exact same symptoms. It's called Jacob's Creutzfeldt disease and it comes from being a fucking cannibal. Yeah. It's like nature's trying to get rid of the people so fucking stupid that they're eating people so crazy, so crazy that genetically speaking that those alterations can take place through particular activity. Yeah. You know, it's almost like it's set up, it's like nature set up for you to figure it out.

Speaker 2:          01:39:43       If you look at today, don't eat each other in in this day and age, what what we're dealing with in the age of information and the amount of resource that we have today is the highest level of information that's ever been available to human beings. As far as we, yes, 100% access to information that's ever been available and in this day and age, people are generally moving towards a kinder, gentler way of living life. Yes. You know, I'm a hunter and I take a lot of shit from some people that have these idealistic views of animals online, but I understand where they're coming from. My, my take on it is if you understood animals, you would understand that the death by a hunter is probably the cleanest, easiest, safe as death in any of these animals could go through and these animals are going to die no matter what.

Speaker 2:          01:40:32       You would also understand that the amount of protein that you can get from one deer or elk or one moose like that one animal dies and you could feed a family for a year. I mean, you shoot a moose, you could feed a family for a fucking year. That's real. I just shot a 900 pound Moose. I have 400 pounds of meat coming. That's 401 pounds at work. I was wanting to ask you that. So you shoot the Moose, there's the meat, like how does it, you can't obviously hop on an airplane when I'm having it shipped, I'm having, it's very expensive. It must be frozen the whole way. It has to be frozen. So it's an, and it's very difficult times. People just take some of it back and they lead to the, to the guide. Like I have a friend, my friend John is a guide up in Alberta and he eats meat, Moose meat all year round because people give it to him, but he also gives it to his neighbors.

Speaker 2:          01:41:23       He gives them, they never buy meat from the store. They eat everything that they shoot or their clients. Shoot. He's an outfitter. So he takes people to these hunting environments and you know, they have massive amounts of meat that come from these animals and the animals die like that. You know, you shoot an animal with a gun, boom. They follow up. They didn't even know people are there. Then all of a sudden they're dead. What does it take to take a moose down? Big Rifle? Yeah. Seven millimeter Remington, ultra mag. Boom. Where do you hit him? The lungs is the best double lung because you want to eat the heart. You don't want to waste any of the organs. The hearts are delicious. Yeah. Wow. You want to eat? I'll show you photos. You want to eat the heart. The heart is delicious. Delivers Trisha's to very nutritious.

Speaker 2:          01:42:04       She don't want to ruin any of the internal organs. Some people don't eat Oregon's. I like him. I think they're really good for you and they taste good, especially if you prepare them right. You always watch on those nature shows where like the lions will go for the Oregon's first. You're very nutritious. The liver, especially the liver dictates what wolf is. The alpha male. The alpha male gets to eat the liver first. Really? Yeah. Yeah. When? When wolves take out an animal is there was a guy who lived with wolves and he had this a weird fucking set up in this nature preserve where he was pretending to be the Alpha male. And one of the ways he showed dominance is he would have a kill that they would place and he would put a liver inside of it and he would pull the liver out and eat it in front of these wolves and he would let them eat.

Speaker 2:          01:42:45       That was how he established himself. And that's some gangster shit right there. Very gangster and very crazy because this guy wound up having to leave because he had to go and leave the preserve to help this local farmer who was getting his, his, his animals are getting killed by wolves. So he had a scare them off. So they set up all these speakers and put these wolf sounds and what they basically tried to do was pretend that a larger, much larger, much scarier pack had moved in. And so they push these other wolves off and he was gone for like a couple of months, I believe. Well when he came back, the wolves no longer accepted him as the Alpha, so he had to beg for his position in the pack and the wolves were snarling, Adam and the new alpha was going to kill him, and so this guy was in dire danger and he was whimpering and cowering and he had to completely bow down and submit to this animal that was previously allowing him to be the Alpha crazy. But this, this wolf in the absence of the Alpha, this wolf had taken over. That's that hierarchy, that social hierarchy that exists within a pack that's got to be, that's is that exclusive

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       to wolves. First of all, know exists in chimps exams as laws exists a lot of Alpha male and credit. Predatory animals, not even just predatory. I mean, gorillas aren't predatory at all. Gorillas, Vegetarians, right? Having a female fight each other. Yeah. When you look at a gorilla's teeth, those are for defense. Those are, those are for fighting, right? They don't eat anything but vegetables. How do they become the biggest crazy, what was that AP we're talking about on on some other pod condo. Ape Bondo. A, the Bili or Bondo ape. It's a, it's an enormous chimpanzee but not as big as the gorilla. No, not quite interesting, but really big nests on the ground like a gorilla. But there's very few photos, very few, uh, like videos of them. They have skulls though. They know it's a complete subspecies of that chimpanzee that actually has a crest on its forehead.

Speaker 3:          01:44:40       Like a gorilla does. Like a gorilla has like, you know, like almost like a Mohawk crest down the center of his head and the enormous biting muscles. Hmm. Yeah. That's interesting. When like you have the long term development of specific traits as an identifier. Like your body is reacting to the social environment in a physical way if give it given enough time. What kind of makes sense? If you think about the variety of humans? I mean they're finding, they're always finding new species of humans. Like they found this new human that lived in Russia is recently as 40,000 years ago. Complete subspecies. Like, you know, there's Neanderthal, there's homosapien and there's that. The hobbit person, they found the Flores. That fucking thing was alive 12,000 years ago. Wild 12,000 years ago, there was a three foot tall monkey person. Look at the variety, just if people that exist right now, just that you remember on a previous podcast you were talking about, uh, that MMA fighter, the transgender MMA fighter.

Speaker 3:          01:45:41       And then you also said like African American females have the same bone density as an untrained males, like a it Ma men who don't, if you lift weights, man who lift weights about a higher bone density, alright, then men who don't live weights, right? African American females have a very similar bone density to white males who don't lift weights. That's crazy. Crazy. And so then you would assume that African American males have even bonded us even thick and even higher bone density. Yeah. Yeah. Bringing up the, bringing up the question of like, because there's the argument in that particular case was that she has a strategic advantage, right? We're not just our physical city. There's mechanical advantage shores, the hip size of the hand, size of the jaw. The ability to absorb punishments different varies. But the also the argument can be made across the board. I mean there are some men that are way more feminine and if they transitioned to a transgender woman, they would be way closer to a biological woman. Then if say like Mark Hunt transition to being a female, I mean that's a tough, you know, take

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       Brock Lesnar and turn them into a transgender person like you gotta fucking tough sell. It's a very problematic when whenever you're dealing with changing nature and trying to balance things out. Yes. That's the argument against testosterone replacement therapy. Testosterone replacement therapy was erroneous Lee aloud and then they realize like, well, what the fuck are we doing? We're allowing guys, essentially it takes steroids. The idea being that some people were unfair, it was an unfair disadvantage because they didn't have as much testosterone so you allow them to take it. But then guys were taking like fucking alien levels of testosterone. I mean, they, they had one guy test at the average person has between 300 and 600 like for a really young healthy man, milligrams to Nanogram, whatever the fuck does, but whatever the, the, the, the measurement is, but this guy had 1,475 they, you know, and he was on the testosterone place and you're like, okay, you fuck, you know, like ruin it for everybody just ruined it for every, you're juicing, you're taking steroids.

Speaker 2:          01:47:51       And that's, you know, it's like some people have naturally high levels. Yeah. But there's also some people that have naturally low levels and the argument is some people are more athletically inclined and there's some people that are just, they're just whatever they do, they're going to have this ectomorphic like Pudgy, buttery. So for a long period of time, presumably fighters were fighting with testosterone. No problem. We'll, they wasn't even, it wasn't a thing that was restricted. Right. And adding it, it was always restrict. Totally. It was, yes. Always. Yes. Well before they were being tested. This is, this is primarily speculations, but based on a lot of evidence from fighters from first account firsthand accounts of guys who actually did this, a giant percentage of MMA fighters in the early days were on steroids. A giant percentage, like a huge percentage. 90 something crazy. Yeah. Okay. Let's say even if it's 60, that's crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:48:50       You know? Um, and then they started doing urine tests and urine tests are essentially an intelligence test. All you have to do is cycle off. By the time you weigh in on, you know, fight day and or after your fight and as long as you've cycled off, you have all the benefits of taking testosterone or whatever the fuck you're taking and none of it shows up in the urine test. Then, um, people get caught even during urine tests and they're like, oh, okay, well you fucking dummies. You have made us want to look deeper into this thing. And then they started doing random tests on people and then they started catching a lot of people. And then they said, okay, well we need to do is do really heavy duty comprehensive blood test. And that's what the UFC has started doing fairly recently. The problem is they're really expensive.

Speaker 2:          01:49:38       They're doing that to comply with what? Not with anything. No one's asking them to do it. They're doing it because they want to clean up the sport because the sport is a huge image issue. And also from a safety perspective, a person who is on testosterone, say if you and another guy who were of the same age or the same body type your same weight and you decide to fight, but you're, your opponent is taking all sorts of performance enhancing drugs, it's conceivably possible and very likely that he'll be able to hit you more than you'll be able to hit him. He'll have more endurance, he'll be able to do more damage to you. Not always. There's a lot of people that have been on steroids that have lost. So even though they had an unfair advantage, they didn't have the skill level of their opponents.

Speaker 2:          01:50:19       So they've lost. So here's a question for you then in in that scenario, what if both are on testosterone? Yeah. But then you're requiring people essentially to compete at a fair level, you're acquiring them to take something that's going to fuck up their endocrine system. Because if you take testosterone, you don't need it. If you're a person and like you know your, your ball gets shot off in the war, you know, and you know you're not producing it. I mean that was pretty specific. I don't know why I said that. Okay. You know, for whatever reason and you, um, you are allowed to take a hormone, that's one thing. But if you're a person like you who's young and healthy and you just choose to do it to give yourself an advantage and then you force your opponent to do it, to give him an advice, you know, he has to do it in order to keep up with you.

Speaker 2:          01:51:06       The issue is his body doesn't need like extra testosterone. He's adding it to it. So your body is confused. Even though it's a performance enhancing substance, your body is confused as to why the levels are so high. So your body stops producing natural endogenous testosterone. That becomes a problem. And that's how they got around these tests for the longest time because they said my client needs testosterone. Why look at his blood tests and the blood tests showed a very low level of testosterone would they didn't show is the reason why it was low is cause he was taking extra testosterone and it forces endocrine system to freak out and be consistent with the guy who's getting 1,475 is I go, we don't need to make fucking testosterone. We got plenty. Yeah. But see the argument being, obviously I've heard it mostly applied to baseball. It if it seems like baseball was the big issue, they had guys in the courtroom room, whatever it was.

Speaker 2:          01:52:00       And then there was this counter argument which, which was like, well don't you want to see home runs? See, but that's different in MMA. MMA is you're dealing with a sport that's primary objective is to damage your opponent. Right. And if you can give someone that lets them damaged their opponent better, more efficiently, you're essentially allowing them to create a crime. I mean this, that's been the argument by people who are clean. No athletes who don't take it like you're, you're, it's like assault. Like what you're doing is like you're hitting them more than you should be able to. You were cheating and cheating. You're causing damage to your opponent and you should be perhaps responsible for that damage that you caused to your opponent. Wow. Do you agree with that? Yeah, it's, it's a very good argument. So I mean, a logical argument, it's like many things in life.

Speaker 2:          01:52:48       Like the transgender argument, it's not a gray, it's not a black and white issue. Yeah. You know, I've always said that I'm in favor of men fighting women. If the woman wants a fight, a man, I'm going to fit. If I'm in favor of people riding bowls, I'm in favor of people. You know, you want to wrestle a bear. OOPS, I'm not stopping you. If you're a grown adult with a functional mind and you understand the risks and that you want to do whatever the fuck you want to do, you want to do it, you go right ahead. I don't have any problem with it, but there's a, you know, you're at a disadvantage. If a woman wants to fight a man, there's no doubt about it. She's at a physical disadvantage. Doesn't mean that a woman can't beat a man. It is possible. There's most certainly possible that a woman who's highly skilled could beat a man that's the same size as her, but it's also possible she get knocked the fuck out.

Speaker 2:          01:53:33       You know? That's possible too. And there was a woman named Lucy, a Riker who's a famous MMA fighter, or do you watch it to rather? What'd you watch it? I've watched everything, Dude. I can't say I wouldn't really, I watch everything you would watch. Let's say Rhonda Rousey fight a man. Yes, I would most certainly want killed and actual dude from the same weight class. I don't think she would fare well. But if she wanted to do it and it was going to be on television, I'll probably watch it. I'm going to be honest. Wow. Yeah. I mean it's, what am I going to do? I'm not watching it. I don't know. I'm just saying courage it. And she called me up and said, hey, what should I do? I'd say, don't do it. I agree with you that it would be a tough, a tough one for her.

Speaker 2:          01:54:13       Right. So because of that, I feel like I can already predict the outcome and I wouldn't want to see that. Maybe, maybe she arm bars a fuck that dude. Right. That's possible too. Right. But it's a dangerous, maybe we'll think about the early UFC like Royce Gracie, fuck chemo for instance. Kimo was far stronger, far larger, far more powerful. And his ability to deliver strikes and hoist was, but I always got him, he's fucking had a war. He duked it out. But his greater skill level prevailed. And that was the essence of what the UFC, what made the UFC so special. It was completely unfair. He had one, you know, quote unquote professional fighters to the word professional is a very loose term, something technique. I mean chemo most certainly eventually became a legit professional fighter, no doubt about it. But back in the day, he was a martial artist who is competing in the UFC.

Speaker 2:          01:55:04       He was like 200 fucking 60 pounds and hoists was one 75 I mean Kimo was jacked. I need just chat. He came in carrying a fucking giant wooden cross on his back. I mean the whole thing was craziness. So without a doubt he had physical advantages over hoists, but hoists his skill level allowed him to prevail. Right. So if that's legal, why wouldn't it be legal for Rhonda to fight a man who has her same weight? Well, I guess I guess there's a difference between legal. Obviously I don't think it should be illegal, but I guess I've just part personally I feel like I could fairly fairly accurately predict the, and then not want to see that outcome. It all depends on skill level. So like, let's take, let's take a, for instance, let's take a middle of the road MMA fighter fights at 155 pounds and make him fight Cain Velasquez.

Speaker 2:          01:55:56       He's going to get fucking steamrolled. But let's take Hixon Gracie when he was in his prime and make him fight a guy who's the same size as cane, but does know what the fuck he's doing. He did that before it, when Hickson was like 19. He fought this Guy Zulu, who's just enormous fucking super muscular dude that Hixon fought in Brazil and Hixon beat his ass twice. He got his back and strangle them. Right. He weathered the storm, had this fucking giant guy smashing them and jumping all over him, but he eventually used a skill level to defeat them. So it's skill level is relative. It's a huge issue in the contest. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Physical got to have the combination. Right. For sure. Right. I guess I just, it's, it's interesting because they put, I was looking at the, uh, what does it pound for pound thing and they put Ronda Rousey on the pound on the pound for pound thing.

Speaker 2:          01:56:47       What does she fight at? One 35 yes. Yeah. And so, you know, I don't know that sad. I guess that's what stood out to me. Like it doesn't even, I don't know. To me it didn't make sense. Well women's MMA, she's number one. Oh, I know. Hands Down for sure. But she was in the list with the dude. Yeah. Let's see. That's tricky. It's tricky. I mean it's very subjective. The pound for pound list is very subjective in my opinion. Is Mighty Mouse Johnson's the best? He fights at one 25 when I look at like technically what he's able to do. Right. I don't, I don't think there's anybody like him in MMA does everything perfect. But a lot of people don't think of him as number one because he fights it 125 pounds. He's a small guy and you know, they look at like John Jones who's also elite.

Speaker 2:          01:57:32       I mean so good. But he's two oh five so you think of John Jones being the number one guy because he's knocking guys out. Just submitting guys. But Demetrius is doing things perfectly. Like if you've scaled up Demetrius, oh my God, if you make Demetrius, if he can move the way he moves and he'd be 250 pounds. Yeah, it'd be the greatest fighter the world has ever known. Right. But some of it's relevant relative too, right? Because he, is he facing the same competition? No, he's not. And he's also not facing the same amount of dangerous. The amount of people that get knocked out in the flyweight division is relatively small in comparison to the night now, number of people that get knocked out in the heavyweight division holding onto a few extra brain cells, there's a point of diminishing returns and it comes to the ability to deliver power.

Speaker 2:          01:58:12       When you think about like what a 250 pound man can deliver and how much 250 pound man can take. Yes. As opposed to what 125 pound man can deliver and what 125 pound man can take. It's like at the heavyweight man, when guys land big shots, even the best guys go down. Even Cain, Cain got clipped by one punch by junior dos Santos and his legs went out and he went unconscious. Yeah, at least briefly. That's just the reality of heavyweight fights. It's one of the reasons why heavyweights are so exciting. That's cause they can end a fight with one punch and that can happen at two oh five and that can happen in one 78 it's even happened at one 25 I mean to meet Trish Johnson knocked out. Joseph Benevidez is one of the best in the world, period. In any way. Class with one punch.

Speaker 2:          01:58:55       He just caught him perfect and knocked him out. The whole, the whole knockout thing like it seems like there's, it seems like UFC has changed a lot. Right? In what way? Well I don't know. I feel like I watched a card the other night. I think it was the most finishes in the history of cards cause I was Sydney. Australia. Yeah. That happens. That happens some sometimes. I don't know. I don't have, the statistics are, are more finishes happening in general right now? Well, they're, they're rewarded for finishing, so people are encouraged to get performance of the night bonuses. Very financially beneficial to them. But you'll also have a card where every fight goes a decision. You know, you also have a card where every fight goes to submission, which is much rare but can happen. Yeah, I guess it's just hidden boilies yeah, I guess it's just like, it almost feels like a guy's career is tied into his ability to knock out maybe more so than being well rounded fighter.

Speaker 2:          01:59:49       Well, like guys who are exciting get, we'll get more fights than guys who may be more skilled. I don't know about all that. I mean it kind of, but ultimately the cream rises to the top, the best guy to hold the full package. The best guys. When, I mean, yeah, like say like say a guy like Rory Mcdonald who was on the podcast yesterday. Oh, role. Roy is not a guy who had chases a knockout, but he's knocked a bunch of guys out. But he's just super skilled and technical and he's undeniable. I mean, he's one of the top contenders and eventually he's going to get a shot at the, but I heard him on an MMA podcast and even he said that his most recent knockout was what he needed to cement the title shot. What was a big win too? He fought Terex Hafeni who's a former Strikeforce welterweight champion and destroyed him.

Speaker 2:          02:00:37       Beat his ass. So it was a definitive, exciting Vic. That's what I mean. That's what I mean is it's a, it's a better story. Travels farther. What sells, you know, it's a lot of it. And what sells. Like there's so many guys in that division, Matt Brown, Robbie Lawler, Hector Lombard, and these guys are fucking ferocious, has so many ferocious guys in that division. It's, you got to sell yourself. So you would say you climb the ladder faster if you're knocking guys out. Well, if you're exciting, but you could be submissions. You know, Damien Maia climbed the ladder fast by submitting people. It's, it really depends entirely on what the routed and it also like who you beat. You know, if she'd go in there and you beat a guy who's not that good, but you knock them out, that's not as impressive as if you go in there and you knock out Anderson Silva.

Speaker 2:          02:01:22       It's just that Mcgregor deserves the hype. Everybody deserves what they get. So yes, everybody deserves what they get. Whether or not he's the best in the world, that's to be determined, but he gets people excited. That's a big part of what the sport is about. When we were talking earlier about charisma and teachers, like teachers having the ability to be excited about the subject matter, and it makes people drawn to them well in MMA, the ability to get people excited about watching you fight is, it's an aspect of fighting. It's, it's, it's a, it's a variable and you know to say that Connor doesn't get, why do you let them talk then? How about we never left fighters talk, you know, how about we never do post fight interviews. You're obviously a part of the integrated package of you want to follow a guy, you want to know who he is.

Speaker 2:          02:02:08       And then there's some guys like John Jones is a perfect example. Jon Jones a spectacularly talented, but people don't like him for some reason. And I've speculated that some of it might be racism because he's this young cocky black guy. But there's a lot of people that disagree with me and they say no. Like they think he's fake. They think his personality sucks or they think that, you know, he does too many stupid shit, stupid things that are contrary to this Christian image that he's trying to sell. And there's a lot of variables. But the reality is Conor McGregor puts more asses in seats than the number one pound for pound fighter in the world. And that's fucking crazy. Yup. John Jones is being fucking everybody, man. He beat Ryan Bader. He put on my treated, the automic, cheated asleep. He beat a gust of sin and the fucking unbelievable war of attrition.

Speaker 2:          02:02:51       He, I mean, he's beating everybody. They put in front of me, submitted Vito Belfort. You can go on and on and on. His list of accomplishments have been spectacular. Conor knocked out Dustin Pour, Yay, that's his best fight. You know, knock on Diego Brandao could fighters, but they're not, there's not Josie, although he's not destroying Josie, although in the first round. So it's like what? What is it about here that if it moves too far in that direction that it becomes more of a show in less of a contest? No, because there's always a guy like Cain Velasquez. Cain Velasquez doesn't talk much. Beats everybody's ass. Right? That's how you beat your rate at a time. Yeah. If Conor Mcgregor, you know, wasn't skilled, he wouldn't be getting as much hype. Part of what is hyped about him is that he's the perfect combination of things. He's an intelligent trash talker who's also highly skilled and his results have been pretty God damn oppressive.

Speaker 2:          02:03:43       Whereas Cain Cain is huge just because he's awesome. I mean, do you even, I mean, no one can even recall one thing that he said that's been like captivating, but when he beats your ass for five rounds is fucking unbelievable storm of punches. And kicks and knees and take downs in this never ending gas tank. That's what makes Kayne special. What makes him special is his fucking skill level period. End of this cut. Same with Mark Hunt. No one's getting all fired up about hunts personality and interviews. You know me feels awkward on camera, but man, when he fucking launches a left hook and shatters dudes, jaws and sends him flying, that's what people get excited about works too. I guess it's just, I guess it's just interesting that how the whole social social media structure has in every facet increased is the importance of how of your public behavior.

Speaker 2:          02:04:37       Once like once upon a time athletes that was just not even something they had to consider. Right. You know, and now you're not just training at the gym, you're training with the PR person who's trying to help you get the most out of every tweet. What's also the difference between a person like who the person actually is and their public persona, right? That's eroded, right? You get to know who they really are. Like, if you've, if someone makes some like really offensive or really ignorant tweets and they put all like it, you go, oh well that guy has these thoughts. You know, like the guy from orange is the new black, what is his name? Jason Silva. Is that his name? The guy from, Oh Silverman. Silverman. Yeah. Like I read this article saying that he was ruining the show for them because his tweets are so stupid.

Speaker 2:          02:05:29       And uh, I was reading as to love that headline. They are really dumb. His tweets are don't. Wow. They really, they are really dumb. His tweets. But it's family. In what way? Like she says stupid shit. It's like wow, you can pull them up. But no, I just think the offending people very bright. Wow. They're, they're goofy. Alright. Ignorant kind of tweets. Okay. I mean maybe he's not, maybe it's just not put a lot of effort into it. You know, sometimes people tweet shit and they just write it down and expect it to be like scrutinized. And there's that possibility too, you know? Or maybe he's not aware of how goofy 142 they ask him to stop tweeting. I don't know. Oh, I know there was a guy in ESPN that actually there was a store that I tweeted the other day that he got suspended off Twitter because he was arguing about evolution, arguing for evolution with some other baseball player.

Speaker 2:          02:06:23       And Espn denied that that was the reason why he got removed. But what at little fuck else could it have been? He was arguing with his former athlete who was like nuts. No believes the earth. 10,000 years old, one of those motherfuckers. Right. And he got suspended. Like the fact that ESPN can suspend you from Twitter and ESPN says it has nothing to do with that. When you tell us what the fuck it out do it because none of the shit that he said is offensive. Right. He was talking with no swears, no insults. Talking about science and how important science was talking about transitionary fossils, talking about the reality of evolution. This is the evidence. And they suspended him from Twitter. So what else would cause them to suspend him from Twitter? What the fuck could you do outside of tweeting that would cause you to be suspended from Twitter?

Speaker 2:          02:07:14       And how the fuck does ESPN suspended guy from Twitter, not, not uh, a part of their marketing plan? Well, you know, they're saying that they own you, they own your thoughts, they own your ability to express yourself. Yes. Do you, there is a connection between the sports fan in religion though. How many thank God's coming out after a fighter wins or someone wins the super bowl or maybe, but this guy was pretty clear about who's wasn't saying that there was no god. Oh he wasn't saying he was, it wasn't anti religion, Bollywood pro sign those, those that disagree with the concept of evolution or whoever it was he was arguing with, that's still a large percentage of the public if that's really what they're going for. It obviously, I mean obviously you're not, yeah you are, but shabby God damn at Espn, right? He's just fucking Christ.

Speaker 2:          02:08:06       I mean that's just like how many times does it have to be explained over and over and over? How many biologists have to come on board? How many times does evolution have to be explained? I don't know that they need to believe it. I think that they're just more worried about satisfying the audience and audience. A segment of the audience that they might have walked out fuck ever. It's just so depressing that a sports network could actually have issue with a guy who's talking about, I agree with you and beyond that, it's his Twitter account. Exactly. Yeah, but it's not, oh, you if you, I mean it is, but if you work for ESPN is not your Twitter, you're their bitch. You're their bitch. And that's, that's a common thing they tweet for people that are on television shows. When I was doing a show, they asked me, they wanted to take over my social media.

Speaker 2:          02:08:53       They'll fuck adding. Yes they did. And I told him to go fuck themselves. Like, are you out of your fucking mind even asks you that. I won't say no. No, not a name, but like a company that I was working for, a network that I was working for that wanted to take over my, they wanted a tweet for me and I said, you can go fuck. You can't tweet for me if you, if you read a tweet is the only time the tweets not from me is when it's an auto upload, a youtube video where it says just uploaded, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's not coming from my fingers on the keyboard, but it's coming directly from someone who works for me who's only tweeting something through a automatic top blue. There's a little checkbox that says, yes, tweak this. Yeah, exactly. And just to let everyone, the other videos are getting uploaded. It's not opinions, it's not facts. It's not interesting articles or stories that I find fascinating. It exposes though, it exposes the whole a deficiency of that traditional medium, how they can just sort of dangle it. You know what I mean? How compliance is such a huge part of it. Will you know what happened with Joan Rivers, right? Oh Shit. The endorsement after she was dead. Yes, it was an iPhone endorsement. That's crazy. Like what the fuck is daddy at all about? Very, very creepy. Disgusting. I saw that come up.

Speaker 2:          02:10:11       So that's one of those things are bad. You don't realize, you don't realize bad look, choose or that I, you know, there's a thing called UFC fight pass that allows you to watch fights. I love it too. And I was using it. I'm like, man, five past fucking awesome. I love this thing. And I tweeted it because it was, and people will use shill how much they pay you for that. Like zero, zero. Right. You can't like anything. Well, I can't look anything as UFC related. Yeah, sure. Yes. Which is, which is weird. What's good? This looks good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because people are there checking up there. They're there, they're questioning things. They're not just accepting things for face value. They're assuming that some fuckery is around and even though they're wrong in some circumstances, I liked the fact that there's some fantasy. It's a bad investment for you. For me personally, yes. No, not really. Cause I can talk about it.

Speaker 4:          02:11:00       No. Oh No, no, no. I'm not, it's a bad investment for you. What did I, what did I mean to say by that? Like you can, you can go out there and talk about something that you like. Right. But the second that somebody can point out that maybe you were influenced in some way than they have, they have a case, right? And, but if you allow, if you allow that to happen, right? If you allow them to respond, like do you respond back to them? No. No, but on here maybe.

Speaker 2:          02:11:29       Yeah. I mean, I mean, I'm saying it right now on Twitter. If I did that all day, that's the people that I'd be responding to and that would make people gravitate towards criticizing me so that I would respond to them. I mean, that's the trolling trap, right? Yeah. They criticize you. So they get you to try to react to them and they go, hi, you reacted. I won. I mean, that's what it is. A game. Well, it's, and there's legitimate criticism that's interesting. You know that like you gotta take into consideration. There's people that have a perspective that maybe even if you don't agree with, you could see their point of view and maybe adjust with what you are projecting so that you're more clear with your original intention where your or your, your actual intention. There's people that get things wrong. They, you know, and that's how small a fucking, especially when it comes to Twitter, it's 140 characters and it's, it's typing, you're missing inflection.

Speaker 2:          02:12:19       He's a social cues. Yeah. There's so much that's missing context. There's so much that's missing. It's such an, that's one of the issues that I have with blogs. Like you can write a bunch of really harsh shit in a blog, but while you're typing things out, like a conversation is a real way to communicate things. And when you're typing things you can, you know, you're, you're missing all sorts of social cues and contexts you're missing. Who is that person that's writing that? I want to see your fucking stupid face when you're writing this or when you're saying this. I want to see someone challenge you on it and see what your response to the challenges. So I know who you are as a human and I know whether or not to take your ideas into consideration. So then what's the consequence of people communicating less this way and more through their thumbs? A lot of confusion for sure. There's there's,

Speaker 4:          02:13:10       and also the ability for individuals to draw the conclusions that reinforce what they already think. Yes. Which is a problem.

Speaker 2:          02:13:19       It's definitely a problem and it allows people to have careers that are social retards, allows them to express themselves in this really distorted way and basing it on their preconceived notions what this person is and this is the result I would like to draw. So I will write a, you know, fucking thousand words on this. Yes. The Internet has allowed for individuals to hide in a way that they were never capable of before. You just get around a group of like minded individuals and jerk each other off all day long and your gold. Yes. While there's a really interesting article that I was reading about this guy who was a part of this like skeptic community and he disagreed with these other people in the skeptic community and this woman who's in this community had written some blog criticizing him and he said that he was going to be at this certain conference who would love to discuss it with her and she wrote, do not approach me at this conference.

Speaker 2:          02:14:15       You're not say. And he was like, well you wrote 14 different blogs mentioning me and I can't even say hi to you. And then another man said, I am also going to be this conference and if you come near me and talk to me, I will have the conference organizers are inherited called. But it's like you're a vote, you're a social retard and you're admitting your social retard because you're willing to communicate about this person. You willing to, you know, call them out or you know, a fucking publicly shame them or whatever you trying to do with your written words. But it's as far as like actually communicating like human beings were naturally doing before the Internet. You don't want any part of that, right? Like you want to be able to criticize them, but knock community, you want to have more control over the discourse than you should be allowed.

Speaker 2:          02:14:59       But you also want to define reality. You don't want reality to find, you don't want that person to be in front of you and going, I never said that. Like, that's not what I mean. You know, that's not what I mean. What you're doing is reinforcing your own narrative by distorting reality, social anxiety, uh, high school all over again and I mean that's what they're trying to avoid. They're trying to avoid confrontation by creating confrontation in, in a literal way and in a way where you know, in, in, in a written word way and insulated way. That's why then they put it on a blog. Just the choir. Anybody who disagrees. Banham. Anybody disagrees in the comment section, Ban them and create this fucking echo chamber and it's so unhealthy. And that's, I mean, that's a lot of progressive thinking today. They'll call it progressive, but it's like so closed off to any alternative points of view, you know, I mean, progressive, conservative conservatism, right?

Speaker 2:          02:15:50       It's like, it's like a religion in a lot of ways. In a lot of ways. It's restrictive, alternative and also very unkind. You know, one of the things about like a lot of progressive culture, today's is call out mentality. And this, you know, there's no ability to, uh, shame. I got something coming up, uh, uh, video that I'm doing for charity, uh, this holiday season. It's for UNICEF. I don't know if I'm allowed to talk about it, but whatever. I already, I already did a, and they approach me and they're like, listen, you know, this time of year you're going to be showing off all the latest and greatest cool stuff people to buy. Uh, would you

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       be willing to unbox our survival box? They have a survival box, which is like fundamental things that can help people survive in shitty parts of the world anyway, and immediately asked her, I said Yes to do it. I thought, oh fuck, as UNICEF fucked anybody over. Like what did I just open myself up to? Because there's this concern that like through association, even if my intentions were the best, that to the right person, I may have just added just the right amount of fuel for them to build an identity around my decision. That's so true, right? You have to be really careful when you attach yourself to anyone in sanction. Very, very careful. Then now I'm reading the Wikipedia in UNICEF and it turns out that they collect, uh, in terms of revenue, like, like billions, like they're huge. But on the positive side, a way to evaluate a charity is to see how much money actually makes it to the people that you're supposed to be helping as opposed to like the administration, like the salaries of the people that work there. And 92% gets out to people. That's incredible. Which is pretty good. So it's incredible. I mean, that's probably the best I've ever heard. Is it?

Speaker 2:          02:17:46       Yeah. I don't think I've ever recall. I don't recall anybody getting that much. I've, I've heard of horrible scenario where zero or like 80% and 80% goes to administrative costs and that's a common, that's fairly common. And they'll say, well, there's no other way, you know, you know, there's no other way around it. There's, there's some pretty big obscenity charities out there. Yeah. If you Google the percentage of money that actually goes to charity, there's some pretty harrowing numbers when we've talked about on the podcast have already listed all the railings. Yeah. Some of them are just disgusting. This is a lot of fake fucking charities and people get involved. And I'm like, do you remember when, why clef John was running for fucking president of Haiti? No. Yeah, this is like, that's like one of the big criticisms was that how much of the money was going like that he was trying to generate for his, um, campaigns trying well, he was trying to, uh, benefit Haiti after Haiti to get hit by that big earthquake. And there they found out that like a very small percentage of the money was actually going to elite illegal. I don't know man. I don't think there's actually like a league goal number.

Speaker 4:          02:18:55       So you can start a charity for a particular cause. Have no interest in servicing that cause keep all the money for yourself and call it salary.

Speaker 2:          02:19:04       Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like that's a huge fucking problem, right? Yes, it should be, but I think you can get away with some shit man. Apparently. Yeah. That seems to be, that seems to be the case. Yeah. Quake gains little why club can be found at hip hop artists. Uh, when was this quake in Haiti? Little can be found of a hip hop artist charity and there's um, he was claiming that he and dirty crucifixion after the earthquake when he faced questions about his charities financial record and the ability to handle what eventually amounted to $16 million in donations. That's so dark, man. Hmm. Yeah. I don't know like how much actually went where, what obviously, I don't know. He could be swindled by some dude that he was attached to who ended up misusing the funds. And yeah, it's possible. But somebody in that chain of command is a dark human being. This is what it says. The forensic audit audit examined $3 million of the charities, uh, 2005 to 2009 expenses and found (250) 600-0580 in illegitimate benefits to Mr John and other, a Yaley board and staff members as well as improper or potentially improper transactions. These included $24,000 from Mr. Jones show first services and $30,000 for a private jet that transported Lindsay Lohan from New Jersey to a benefit in Chicago that raised only 66,000. So 50% of the money that the benefit raised went to Lindsay Lohan's jet.

Speaker 2:          02:20:47       Yeah, I dunno. The audit considered it appropriate though for the charity to pay Mr John $100,000 to perform at a fundraiser in Monaco because that was his market rate. So he did a fundraiser and during the fundraiser that he organized, he got $100,000 he had himself paid $100,000 for a fucking fundraiser. Well, I'd like to be clear about this upcoming units at video. They did offer me money to do it and I said, hell no. How about that? It also found acceptable Yaley I guess. What is the name of the benefit to spend $125,114 on travel and other matters related to a 60 minutes report on why clefs mission to help the people of Haiti and his personal success story. So what's the fallout for this? People think he's a piece of shit. He's probably, yeah, I didn't even know about it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          02:21:45       I don't know man. It's like if, if he generates all this money and more money goes to the charity, then would have gone to the charity without him doing it. Is that a benefit? Is that an inappropriate thing? It's, I don't know. Think him getting paid a hundred grand, do a fucking show when he's doing a chair. I mean, I've done fundraisers. You know what? I get paid zero. I thought for 10 the whole idea, every time I've done a fundraiser, I've gotten paid zero months. Yes, he got a hundred grand doing a fundraiser. That alone is fucking bullshit. Yeah, that's bullshit. But that plays up the whole thing we were talking about earlier about how people want to attach themselves to something and because that it's easy to prey on those individuals. I'm doing a charity, I helped the poor. Don't you want a piece of that?

Speaker 2:          02:22:30       Doesn't your, that doesn't your psyche require that, that great feeling that comes through donation? Definitely. Definitely. But the problem is with things like this, I think people are fools if they don't know that that's going to get out. Oh, you mean in his case you have to be a fool to not know that someone's going to find out you spent 30 grand on a fucking private jet and fly Lindsay Lohan to do a benefit. Like how, what? What? Lindsay Lohan. Oh, I'm confused. You know you're not flying Nelson Mandela somewhere. All right. Like what? What kind of an impact is Lindsay Lohan, a young pretty actress girl going to have on your fucking charity for Haiti? Right. You're telling me that that money wouldn't have been better spent on Haiti itself? Like that seems crazy. Yeah. I, this is one of the benefits of the distribution of information and things opening up is like once upon a time if some charities asking you for money and you have, you literally, there's no way to even look for that information or to to figure out where that money's going.

Speaker 2:          02:23:26       So it's going to be, it's obviously harder now to to hide those operations because in his case, yeah. Could you imagine what it would have been like just decades ago just to, to audit an organization. It's a charitable organization. How many charitable or charitable organizations over the years it had been total frauds just bilking money from people cashed too. Is there a standard number? I mean do you have to have a certain percentage that is like I dedicated towards the charity mean to me personally, just from like a logic perspective. If it, it would seem it would have to be half. No. Am I, am I crazy? Does that seem reasonable? Yeah. Well even that, I mean, the think a UNICEF, UNICEF is fucking Brockton with 98%. 90 to 90%. That's amazing. Crazy thing is though I still did the math on it and they're so huge that that remaining 8% is still a big number. The worst. Uh, there's a thing on America's worst charities. America's 50 worst charities. Raykin nearly 1 billion for corporate fundraising is very fitting this time of year because these, these vultures, these vampires, they're out right now. This is when they're coming after you. Above the law. America's worst charities.

Speaker 5:          02:24:40       This kid's wish network, uh, millions of dollars. They only give a set of 3 cents on the dollar to helping kids. That's the children's wish foundation. Which network? Oh, okay. They're like a rip off of the 2010. They hired the crisis management woman. I'm not going to give her name, but that did the BP spill

Speaker 2:          02:25:00       for disgusting. It's just, you know, there's so many vultures out there and then so many people that they want to make a lot of money being involved in charities, they're like, ah, you know, I'm a CEO of a charity. I should be making what a CEO of a corporation we make. Well that's like, that's counterintuitive. That's, that goes against what everybody thinks of when they think of charities. I think of you doing it for charity, like you're doing it. This is like you're doing it to help. How do you feel about charity in general? So it's a great thing if it's real, it's a great thing. If it's a real, I mean much of it could be a problem to write too much charity. In what way? Well, I don't know. Everyone always talks about like aid going to Africa and then war lords and shit taking control of it and it only helping them maintain their grip of on of power and yeah, that's kind of a different conversation.

Speaker 2:          02:25:59       I know it's not, yeah, like real charity is like Red Cross. Like would people need blankets and there's just some sort of a disaster in that come in. They get food and they set up a, you know, a food kitchen for folks that you mean like check charity here? Yeah. Local charity charity that you can audit. Mm, I see what you're saying. Charity where you know it's going to be like if you watch like a soup kitchen line, like okay, that's real. Like there's these people. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I want to contribute to that. If you're sending money to, you know, fill in the blank some country sending money to the Congo. Well yeah, the UNICEF one is to help people there in Africa and that's the, that's the weird part of it. Okay. So it's 92% is going to those people, but how much of it actually goes? Exactly.

Speaker 2:          02:26:47       People suck. And that's, I think that's the conclusion that we could probably draw somewhere on the east. Like whether it's from Ferguson or this fucking CV, CBC guy that's beating chicks up or bill Cosby, Julian people and raping them. We have focused on a lot of negativity. This podcast, I feel like we could, we could have done better. Where's the optimism? It's too late. There's also the thing that when you're aware of negativity, it kind of, when you expose it, it makes it much more difficult for that negativity prosper in the future. I suppose you're correct about that. Right, so maybe in that case our negativity was actually positivity. I would like to look at it that way. Seems convenient. I would like to say that we did some good, we had some, some discussions. We highlighted some gray areas. It's true. They need to be highlighted.

Speaker 2:          02:27:40       Yeah. Yeah. You need to be aware. Well, it's also what we're doing is by doing a podcast, by talking about stuff and by examining these ideas as open a mind so we can, you're, you're exchanging information and that information gets people to think about these things and changes the perceptions and the future of what these things are. You know, like we didn't know that there was a radio guy that likes beating the fuck out of checks. We didn't know until that information got out. That guy was a big time radio guy in Canada for a long time until the information got out that he was beating people up or be on women up showing that in that case he could, you know, the argument is that that

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       information getting us, uh, getting, getting out and then us talking about it is going to get to people who may have sure being like him. Right. And maybe they would deter them from doing the same thing, I dunno. Right. And there's, there's, there's a certain amount of positivity and justice. Yes. You know, when someone's doing what bill Cosby allegedly did, drugging women, what do you think will happen with Bill Cosby? That's a good question. With this, this guy, this John, whatever the fuck his name is, Kashi going, getting arrested, going to jail. Yeah. I find it hard to believe that someone's not gonna file charges against bill Cosby. Yup. And it's just gathering steam. Right? Well, it's just a matter of how much evidence they have. How much ice or the issue right now is the, there is a restriction. What is it? The Statute of limitation?

Speaker 3:          02:29:09       Yeah. Oh, the age that the crime was more than 25 years ago, right? Am I right about that? 25 I don't know what the number is. That's tricky. When you're dealing with a guy that's that old too, like he probably doesn't fuck anymore. You see? Right. I mean it has to take the agro, rape, whatever. He'd go way out of his way to rape me. You mean he's got the, he's got the ingredient. He's got the ingrained, he's taking the right vitamins probably. Did you see the Associated Press thing? Yes. That little clip there was that evil. Ooh, scary. The way he responded to it, it was like, we don't discuss these things and I was relying on your integrity. Is that evil? Pure evil.

Speaker 3:          02:29:52       There's a lot going on there, man. First of all, it's this elite royalty attitude. First of all, he gave them the royal. We do not respond like that's amazing, right? I'm talking to you, man. That's it. That's a sociopath. We means we means that he views himself as a character, right? Isn't that what that means? What does it mean? We means there's more than one of him. Yeah. What does that mean? We the organization known as Bill Cosby artist known as bill Cosby. Yes. Representative of the artist, the real version and the persona. He's in weeding. There's two versions. I have a team behind me. We do not yet respond and he kept saying integrity. In this weird world, I'll rely on your integrity and I relied on your integrity to not really, data always kills me. What I always think about whenever I see any shit like that is how would I respond had I not done it right.

Speaker 3:          02:30:45       Exactly. And I always think I'd say, listen, get the fuck off my case. Half speed didn't do it these days. I feel like I'd be on that stand or whatever. Yes. And I would not stop saying that this was not me. Exactly, but yet you never see that. Exactly. Why the fuck do you never see that they're guilty? Probably. I mean if you have to speculate, honestly, I'm just guessing. But if I had to guess when, look, if someone came to you and said, Louis, I know that what you were doing is you were a duck taping duties and fucking their mouth. What? After you drug them, you'd be like, no, I wife,

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       I didn't rape anybody in the mouth. You can't just can't. You can't fake that Reno.

Speaker 3:          02:31:26       No, no.

Speaker 4:          02:31:28       The minute it starts to be labored and it starts to be contrived, you have to immediately say what's the need for the show.

Speaker 3:          02:31:35       Exactly. And there's also, there's such a large number of people that he harmed. It's not like, which one Cosby really? Yeah, there's like 17 women now. 17 oh yeah. Oh Wow. I not caught up on him. 17 yeah. Yeah. There's a lot. Wow. There's a lot of, and more apparently are coming forth. We'll do, you know what they're saying is he was doing this for decades. Yeah. He had a system. I have three fucking donors to, and even if I didn't have a mom, you know, you've had no daughters. I love a lot of women. You know, I love a lot of humans that happened in a female. The idea that someone can do that and that one of the people that I care about and love could somehow or another, how would you react? I don't want to say, you know, it would be finding out where he was, if I knew where he was physically, if I knew where he was physically. And he did that to one of my daughters. Yes. I probably be doing some jail time. He would be in some sort of a full body cast at a young age. I saw the movie a time to kill. I don't know if you've seen it. Which, who's in the Matthew mcconaughey? It's before he started doing romcoms. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:32:43       And sold his soul to the devil. He was in the aids movie. Um, yeah. He's, he know now. He's a bad ass. He was mad Mike or Magic Mike. Oh, you're going back to take a Channing Tatum. No, wasn't he in it to Macada he was in there toe. Maybe magic white. I don't expose myself to that kind of thing. But then he, but he recently did. True detective, which did you watch? True detectives. Right. Wow, that's fucking great. That's the next level. But anyway, I saw a time to kill it. A young enough age that you had a drastic impact on my life, which the premise of that movie,

Speaker 3:          02:33:14       Samuel Jackson, do you remember this? Yeah. You remember the premise? Barely. Oh, okay. So early on, um, uh, early nineties, or black girl gets raped by a bunch of hillbillies. Did they kill her? Yes. Or they might, they killed her. They damaged irreparably. She would never have kids were raped her that badly. And as you might've been eight or nine in the movie, I can't remember. And, uh, and the, the father, uh, uh, murders, murders of the dudes who did it and he kills him. Right. And, uh, mcconaughey's character. The lawyer is arguing that that was just, Yup. Yeah. Well, remember that guy that, um, there was a martial arts instructor that molested his kid and the guy got arrested and they were taking the guy, the cops were taking the guy, um, through an airport or something like that, and the guy jumped out. You shot him in the head? Yes. And got off. Got Off. Yes. I do recall that there's, you know what man? I mean there's certain shit that can't do

Speaker 2:          02:34:17       what any part of you though, worry. This is a very difficult question. Would any part of you worry that the story you were getting from your daughter would be untrue if 17 other people said the same story? Time to die. It's time to break Cosby's arms. Both of them. Wow. And he places, well, there's 17 people. I think if I, if that was my daughter, I would be so consumed with anger. I don't know if I'd be able to contain myself, I would have to actively keep from being anywhere near him because if I fucked up, and I mean there's something about victimizing people that's horrific. I know something about victimizing a woman that's particularly horrific and, and victimize a woman by drugging her and then doing what you want to do with her body, like taking away their humanity. They become like, they become something that you use like a fucking human fleshlight.

Speaker 2:          02:35:09       If they're out cold, you draw them and then you, you fucked them. And like who? I mean, the real question is right. Like the only thing worse you could do is beat them up or worse you could do is like physically hurt them. Irreparably does the only thing worse, like when you take away someone's ability to decide what they do with their body, take away like a part of what makes him a human being. It's nuts. Drugging them Cosby. If that's real. I mean, obviously we're saying, yea, I agree, but, but you said yourself, it's when it gets to 17, he's not up for discussion. Yeah. And we, you know what, you're not talking about a guy who cheated on his taxes. You're not talking about a guy who, uh, I mean, even awful things like drunk driving, he said, you know, like a repeat drunk driver.

Speaker 2:          02:36:03       Yeah. Fuck man. You know, it's horrible. But there's something particularly horrible about a big powerful man who drugs women. It's terrifying. And it's also confusing to people because they're like, God, he's so famous. He didn't even have what's, what's the deal here? What's he, you know, why does he wouldn't, he could have done it the right way and had incredible success. Right. Use the man. Well it's also, I think it fits that narrative that like what is rape would it really is, is not sex power. Yeah. Power. And that's, that also goes along with that whole we shit, you know? Yup. I mean the we shit is, we do not respond to in you window I would assume that you had to integrity and I was relying upon your integrity. Like what? Integrity. It's creepy man. And the guy who's interviewing them is like really intimidated and there's like this weird moment. Yep. Why is that? Because he's not famous and you know, it's bill Cosby and your round them and you're not, maybe maybe it doesn't have a lot of experience and to lose your job, maybe. No, probably what,

Speaker 4:          02:37:16       what the concept of what the fallout would be for asking that question. Well, what would you do in that situation if you were the guy who was interviewing him? What'd you push it? Which my me or like who are you? You're you right now and you have some, for some reason they give you a camera and they let you interview bill Cosby. Holy Fuck. And he wants to talk about as NBC Sitcoms, anytime somebody you get the feeling that somebody is deceiving you, uh, you, I mean me personally, I can't help but not give into that. I can't help it not give into it. You mean to the deception? Yeah. Like I watch, like I talked earlier about watching help not give into it, giving given to it in the sense that challenge it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I've talked earlier, but watching the first 48, like my favorite part is the interrogation.

Speaker 4:          02:38:00       It's like, it's creepy. It's the, the, the, the glimpse into the, into the mind for a moment of how the mind prepares to, to defend itself from anything. The mind prepares due to self preservation to say shit and do shit. That makes no sense. That mean they're tripping over the excuses in an attempt to save their own asses, saying things that they don't even believe. Well, that's why it's got to be particularly frustrating if you're innocent. And a cop is like, look, I know you killed her. You killed your wife. Right? What the fuck man, that's right. Imagine being in that situation. The same thing happens like we said earlier about what would your response be. It happens in those rooms, in those interrogation rooms where you get an immediate vibe as a viewer and I'm sure that the cops being experienced are the exact same way that a true date, a true creepy fucking skilled murderer is obviously the worst because of how how great of an actor they are, how great, how great of a job they can do at exposing all the flaws in how you interpret them, how they can preemptively figure out what your questions are going to be in already have the answers and someone who is really planned out deception.

Speaker 4:          02:39:23       That's right. Deep, deep and advance and is used to doing on a regular basis that there is no antidote for that. The only antidote for that is them eventually wanting to get caught so that they could say a smee. It's always been me. So then they can be on the front fucking page as the only point at which it comes out because, but then you also realize watching that show that those guys, those guys are the shit that dreams are made of. Like there's one every fuck, I dunno how long, true, pure evil. But the vast majority of them are not skilled in that arena. The vast majority of them are like, fuck, I don't know how this happened. You know, they, and, and they'll try the defense, their defense in that state. But it's stumbly and it's, and it's so obvious that they're just attempting to, you know, to spin, spin

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       a web and then so the cops can figure out which path they need to take, uh, to, but it's very, very weird watching it because I, at times, I feel like a sociopath watching it. Brett Dunkin calls it murder porn. I completely agree. I completely agree with him because I watched it and I go, uh, you know, I know all the right answers. I'm skilled enough now. That's weird, right? You can educate yourself watching first 48 that's right. Do you think? Here's a real question. Yeah. Do you think that as we get access to more information about each other and access to each other's thoughts, like literally the, the, the calm, the point in time where 10 years from now and we can record our memories and our thoughts on some sort of a hard drive and have it be exchange, whether it's 10 or 50 or a hundred, whatever it is, will we get to a point where we eliminate evil? Is that possible? Is it possible to get to a point where we eliminate things like murder, rape, crimes against people? Why would an openness a effect that consequences either is 100% consequences to your action? The only time you come still completely in, in incomplete surveillance. Yeah. There's no opportunity to do it without getting caught. Yeah. Uh, what do you think about pedophiles out a vinyl scare the shit out of me, obviously because I have kids, but buckets because I'm, because I watched that, uh, Louis thorough thing he did on pedophiles.

Speaker 3:          02:41:55       They don't have a choice. Some of them, some of them don't know. I think, uh, do you know a disproportionate amount of lefthanded Jesus, disproportionate amount of pedophiles are lefthanded. There's a, there was an article in New York Times that was arguing for pedophilia being a mental disorder that can be isolated and, and, and viewed that you can, you can actually figure out what went wrong, what genes went wrong with what, you know, what genes, the final scene in that movie, uh, maybe not the final, but near the end in his documentary. So he called a movie is the guy that he's been going around with the uh, he basically his guide, the guy who's running the facility for the dudes who are responsible for pedophilia and whatever other sexual offenses. And he finally gets around to asking him the question because he has a little bit of an idea of the history of how he ended up in all this. And his reason for molesting or raping his two boys was that his wife wasn't putting out Whoa, fuck Christ. His wife wasn't putting out and the, that he was going to

Speaker 2:          02:43:11       get back at her. Oh God.

Speaker 4:          02:43:15       Was to take it out on their two kids.

Speaker 6:          02:43:23       Oh,

Speaker 2:          02:43:24       I've heard of people doing that in terms of killing their kids to Yup. To get back at their wife. They've killed their kids. Yup. Yeah. There's some fucked up humans, man. You know, but

Speaker 4:          02:43:36       particular case, the creepiest part about all of it was that the guy seemed way too normal. He seemed throughout the entire, uh, documentary. He was like the most relatable one of all of them. You know, he was, he essentially was, was driving, driving him around. He was the one explaining, he's almost the narrator of the entire thing, with the exception of Louie himself. And uh, it's almost like the dude, uh, you know, you have your traditional mindset of like what, what a pedophile is. Like. Maybe they were molested themselves or they can't help it or whatever. But in this guy's case, it just seemed like a fucking psycho.

Speaker 2:          02:44:18       Well, I think when we think about what, what entails, like what, what ingredients are involved and creating a human being, there's so many variables, so many situations that come up. So much information that gets passed from birth to whatever crime is committed from birth to shooting up a school. There is so much going on, there's so much data and it's so difficult to discern like what is it that causes someone to become a murderer and what is it that becomes, that causes someone to choose a life of crime or to become a rapist or to do, to do anything that harms what, what, where does it go and how can that be prevented and just becoming you. Okay. Becoming a nice guy, becoming who you are. Like think about all the fucking variables that are involved and becoming you and what could have gone wrong. All sorts of things along the way. What drugs could you have been introduced to? How many times could you have been dropped in your head? What things could've gone wrong that have, but how do this, hey, can you completely off?

Speaker 4:          02:45:22       How did this Guy Soak in just and state and how did he fake it so long? Is he facing

Speaker 2:          02:45:30       or is he broken? Does he, is he lacking empathy? Is he missing some sort of a social,

Speaker 4:          02:45:35       he was broken the whole time. He had people fooled for years. He had enough time to be normal enough to not, uh, exercise those thoughts he was having, I guess if we want to make the argument that he was always like that, but in his particular case, the thing that affected me more than any of that was that, oh fuck. I feel like this guy just snapped. I feel like this guy wasn't broken.

Speaker 2:          02:46:04       Not Possible though. Think about you. What, what could your wife possibly do to get you to fuck your kids police? You know what I'm saying? It's not possible. I something wrong along the way. Maybe it's some sort of a inability to recognize his own actions and non introspective quality to his life. A block that he put up early on in life. Yes. There's, you're, you're completely correct in the sense that there's probably more to it, but I think the scariest thing to the regular person is he's too regular. Yeah. That's theory. I don't even know the guy. And you're describing them to me. I didn't watch the whole document. I went on a Louie thorough, um, marathon, which is on my just very easy to do because he's fucking awesome. He's really awesome. He's a really interesting guy to talk to you too. So I watched the Fred Phelps won and I watched the African hunting one.

Speaker 2:          02:46:55       I watched the whole series of them, so I didn't watch the whole one. So I don't know that dude. I can't, I don't know if I would even recommend to watch it, but just because of that. It's really, it's, it's intense man. Yeah. I mean, what goes into creating a you, I mean, what I mean when I say you, I mean everybody who's listening think about all the things I think all the time about what made me me, you know, the, the idea of determinism, the idea of the, all the variables, your genetics, your environment, your, the input, your life experiences, your successes, your failures, your locks, you're zigging when you should've zagged. You're hitting the brakes and a meteor lands in front of your car. I mean, there's so many fucking things that happen in your life. And one thing that goes awful early can send you down a bad road, which could send you to another awful thing which could send you down a bad road.

Speaker 2:          02:47:50       It's like a, it's like you know, many dimensions playing out in front of you, like the, the potential, the potential outcome of every single event and the effect of that an impact. And it makes you really question everything. Our existence as a whole, that the possibilities of that, you know, what also makes you wonder, is it possible to ever completely socially engineered the human race? Is it possible that we could get our shit together 100% and have no evil and no crime and no rape, no murder and all done. We're done. We're good. We're all utopia now we're, I'll just come by ya and hugging each other and smiling to our neighbors because the whole world's our neighborhood now. I think we are so addicted to conflict that will find a way to fuck it up. But are we, are we always going to be, this is the question.

Speaker 2:          02:48:36       Are we the same thing today? That will be will be a million years from now or are we just like those monkeys that came down out of the trees instead of experimenting with new food sources and started eating meat and we'll find other people to do it for us. We'll find other things to do it for us a million years from now do isn't impossible that we can evolve past this. Like we have evolved, at least in this room. Yeah. We have gotten to a point where I'm not worried about I, we could all go to sleep together in this room. I'm not worried about it either. If you guys hit me in the head with a rock, you know what I mean? But if we were living in the Congo, that

Speaker 3:          02:49:08       could be an issue. If we were living in the Congo a million years ago, that could be an issue. I suppose for me, what I fear more than the people around me is the, and their decisions is the proliferation of negativity in general. Ryan, why the fuck does this terrible shit spread like wildfire? Why is the news the news? We all, we all still want it. We just don't want to participate in a physical way, but don't you think like this, this riot things going on, this closing of highways all across the country. The good in that of course is that there are so many people that regardless whether or not the narrative fix the facts, what they want to do is they want to stand up for inequality and even if it's not actually inequality they want to stand up for, and it most certainly is in some way because this guy who no matter what, whether what Arbill things he actually did do, he didn't grow up in your neighborhood.

Speaker 3:          02:50:01       He didn't grow up in my neighborhood. I got a fucking pretty sweet life. I had skated through the difficulties that I had only made me a better person. Here I am in 2014 with no fucking criminal record and it never hurt anybody. Everything's fine. Cool. You know what I mean? This guy for you, thank you very much. This guy didn't, he didn't, his scenario was vastly different than yours in mind. So whatever played out that allowed him to get in front of that cop, I think what people are standing up for is not just police brutality. They're standing up for this recognition that there is inequality in the world to be addressed. Of course, that's one of the poorest areas in the country. Yeah, it's fucked. Yeah. I was looking at like crime statistics the other day and like adjusted for population that is a fucking war zone way there without this police shooting.

Speaker 3:          02:50:52       You know what I mean? It's ultra poor and I know that the reason people are attaching themselves to it is inequality and it's unfortunate I guess that it takes this particular set of circumstances to have that conversation. But uh, ultimately you can't really have a healthy society when there's the nat level, that disproportion between people who have stuff in people. But you also can't have a society that's 300 fucking 50 million people in general. I mean, how, how are you going to organize 350 million people? It's, it's amazing that it works at all. To be honest. A poor community. Anywhere where the crime is low. It's a great question. I think, I don't know how much of it is about being poor in general and how much of it is subjective. Like if being poor in America means being poor relative to the richest people on the planet, right.

Speaker 3:          02:51:50       That's a different ball game and being poor in India I have no, maybe not because now there's rich people there too, but being poor in an environment where everyone's poor, you really pour, do you know what the 1% of the world is? You know what the number is that you have to make to be in the, in the global one, top 1%. It's way lower than people think, right? Yeah. What would you think it would be? I feel like I'm cheating because you may have mentioned it before. Okay, go ahead. Was it something like 40,000 or 35 34 35 yeah. Anything more than $34,000 and you are in the top 1% of the world privilege. Enormous, enormous privilege in this country. You know, enormous privilege. That's an, that seems like, like, Whoa, like that. Strengthen the borders, increase the military. It's impossible to overcome that number.

Speaker 3:          02:52:38       Like I hear where they were dealing with, I thought we're going to fix the world, but, uh, listen, I'm 47, I'll see a whole lot of time to do this. So let's just fucking live in a gated community and get a gun that's, you know, that's you d, How do you psychologically deal with that? Um, the idea of privilege. What can you do? What can you do? I mean, it's real. It's real as it gets. It's, there's no doubt about it. There's some or feeling guilty about it. Can't feel guilty about where you are. I mean, I would feel guilty if I victimize somebody can't feel guilty about being born lucky. Wow. If you can, I mean, can you feel guilty about being born lucky? I don't. I feel bad for people who aren't born like, right. I see what you're saying. It's a little different.

Speaker 3:          02:53:18       But look, Bill Cosby, if he did it should feel guilty. Yes. What I'm saying. You shouldn't feel guilty that you are, you know, not a woman that's being raped. Shit. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah. I don't, I'm, guilt might not be the right word, but uh, there are days where I feel lucky. Right. You know, if you're lucky every day. Yeah. So what's the, what's the, what's the other end of that? You know, I, maybe guilt is not the right word, but there are people who wake up everyday and feel shitty Bryant. And so I guess I don't feel guilty, but I don't feel great that knowing that the vast majority of the planet isn't, but then again, what the fuck is happiness really? Well, then the other thing is how much money is it relative? Like how much money does the vast majority of the planet need to live their lifestyle?

Speaker 3:          02:54:05       When you're talking about poverty, are they well fed and happy? Because, yeah, I know it's one of the things about Mexico, like they were happy. It was like one of the happiest countries on the planet apparent wow. It with all the drug lords and all the consequences of that. That's what most people don't get happy. Those people are really unhappy. The people that have to deal with the drug lords, it's always, it seems to always be a question of contrast really. It's like, uh, I always come up, I come out here to La and, and, and I'm amazed at how every single day is exactly the same. Like from a weather perspective. Oh yeah. Like I left the apocalypse back home to come here and it's like, it could be July, in November and this new July. Yeah. There's no time. The only thing I will say is it gets dark incredibly quickly.

Speaker 3:          02:54:52       Especially being by the beach. It's like in 20 minutes because we're trying to shoot videos and stuff. Like, Whoa, where did the Sun Go? But um, that's because of the stupid daylight savings nonsense, whatever it is. But by, by regardless, it's like, it's always a question of contrast. It's like the good is better relative to the bad. Right, right. It's a, you, you need the bad to have the good, you need to, sad to have to happy. That's the idea of being a human being. Yeah. The question is, will we ever evolve and grow to the point where that is not necessary. And would the universal blind in that aided by technology, would that be the facilitator of that new mindset? So in that scenario, is there a motion? That's a good question. There can't be, that might not be, it might not be sex. I've always said that about robots or about a rather aliens.

Speaker 3:          02:55:44       When you look at aliens or do they have, they have no muscle. They have no sex organs. Big heads, no rounds. Like maybe it mean maybe they've found a replacement that's better than sex. Yeah. The real alien is just the brain hooked up to something. Right. It's not even, there's no physicality at all. Right. Well maybe that's what it is. Maybe it's just some sort of artificial intelligence that it gets downloaded into a body and the only thing that's necessary is it the body has fingers that can articulate and move in a certain way. Yeah. Matrix type shit. I saw an article making the rounds on my Twitter about how people are getting, um, neck problems from their smartphones. Oh yeah. Looking down, looking down and the uh, how posture and the weight of the head, the amount that the cervical spine has to hold up beyond what it was designed to do and the like drastic number of consequences because of that.

Speaker 3:          02:56:36       Oh yeah. Uh, and it really makes you wonder like the sedentary lifestyle that everybody works on a computer. Like who the fuck what profession doesn't require a computer? Smart phone number, Jack. All right, so lumberjack, you're safe. But the vast majority, especially in the expanding sectors are required to interface in a weird way with a monitor and in a posture that is not, is not a, our bodies weren't designed for. So that's why we started using these chairs. Ash, road depot, cherish. I still feel like didn't fix me at all because I've been doing this the last time that is better than the slump. Like you're leaning forward and supporting yourself. Like your elbows on the table is bad in other thing they do is they have these chair or these tables rather that you stand and they stand with standing desks. I have, I have one.

Speaker 3:          02:57:28       A motorized one. Yeah. We just got one, Ergo depot.com they send us these chairs, right? They sent us the desk. They might be the same guys who sent me the desk. I'm not 100% sure. Is it a Jarvis Jarvis task? No, I don't think mine is called a vert desk. Do these chairs and the shit. I was using this other one that's Sally chair, but it hurt my balls and really? Yeah it was, it's like it's split down the middle. I think my ball was still hurt from that. It's not good, but this one's much better. But even with all the equipment and stuff for us to like adjust our into working, still not natural and, and it seems to be continuing to progress in that direction. So you have to wonder. It could, it, could there be a physical, uh, what's the opposite of evolution?

Speaker 3:          02:58:13       Devolving devolving could be physical devolvement and then if you extrapolate that and push it way out, then it all all of a sudden becomes the, the, the, the body is a, is a problem. Like the body is just in the way, or this could be an immediate intermediate step. Yeah. In some new technology that doesn't require you to be at a desk or look at a phone. Oh, I have some sort of, so we can protect the physique or whether you're your frame now, just your, your own, your body itself. Yeah. Sitting is the new smoking, is that what they say? You haven't heard that? No. Yeah, that's what they say. I can hear. I can imagine them saying that. Did we're out of time. Oh really? We did three hours. Just rock goodbye every time. Every time. Dude. Like that. Awesome. Unbox therapy on Twitter, unbox therapy on youtube. Louis, you're the shit. Thank you my friend. Always good to talk to you and sit down. Get a new perspective. Unbox therapy. You fucks. Go follow him. Enjoy your life and a don't rape anybody. See you soon. Bye. Later.
