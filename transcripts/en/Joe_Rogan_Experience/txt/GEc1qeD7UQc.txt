Speaker 1:          00:00:01       I know you guys are banging into your coffee

Speaker 1:          00:00:07       and we're live. You're jumping into swamps and English royalties. Homes like to be introduced together. You can get very careful when you get into those sort of predicament in beheading around every corner when she messed with the royal family's private swamps, especially if you're doing it for some sort of a psychedelic purpose. You're trying to elevate yourself by freezing yourself in there. Cold, swampy waters, freeing yourself. If you're embarking on a journey of personal shamanism on royal territory. Yeah, yeah. Your life's in your hands. Your life could shrivel up as quickly as my sex organs did in that particular predicament. It's definitely an added element. The ads, you have to consider it. It's not a place to go for pride, but as soon as I like, yeah, as soon as I was sort of submerged in it, that's what those. Because even that is just the.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       In this case, just an example of me, a man simply jumping into cold lake and I do have a tendency to over poeticize the mundane experiences of me everyday life, but why not? What else are we going to do while were in a. It did make me think. We are living on narrow lines, narrow train tracks of existence, never to have hurt myself, got animal nor capable of. That's that sort of almost like an anti orgasm like a negative repeat with you would before what you said before you got on camera, how it represents the subconscious and that going into the murky depths. That main role is is in fairy stories, myths and religion person, if you're not already, you reckon you'd world love is it? Or an American scholar called Joseph Campbell who was a cultural anthropologist and he studied various religions and folk towels and found Corolla and comparisons and consistencies and and sort of said that where there are consistencies, there's true.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       If there's some Icelandic myth and it's telling basically at the same story, some African story of some native American story or some daft Celtic folk tale. Why are human beings dislocated all over the world, coming up the same stories, coming up the same experiences? Well, often in these stories, the forest is used as the unconscious, not only the forest represents the unconscious, often in mythology, and you know when a character has to go into the woods, that means you've got to go into yourself, you're gonna have to go into new territory and also under the water. Similarly also represents unconsciousness and will interest in baton. All. Joe Is like not only ancient mythologies and old stories, but also personal dreams. If you yourself have a drug like this is where the work of Joseph Campbell in sex with a worker, Carl young dude, he like. He noticed that people in their personal myths that drives your cameras, said dreams are private myths.

Speaker 1:          00:02:43       Myths are public dreams in people's personal dreams. They come up with images, archetypes and stories that can also be found in fairy tales. You know, just someone asleep. I, Oh, I was just walking and I went into the woods and I met this old woman in the woods and she told me that everything was going to be okay, and then she put up a hood and winch took a hood down again. It was my mother's face. He's like, people are inventing their own myths like that because of course all culture is created by consciousness, so on some level it's in us. It's in US individually. Yeah. Joseph Campbell's work is amazing and when you do look at all the different stories and how they coincide and how, how many similarities they share, it is really interesting to see what are people trying to accomplish with these archetypes, like what are they trying to sort out because it seems like that has to be some things.

Speaker 1:          00:03:28       Lessons passed down to children than to pass down to other people so they can learn things without having to experience the woods themselves. But then there's also some sort of archetypes that they're sort of defining the reality around them in a very similar way all over the world. I suppose what I record joe is the more diverse our culture, but like know it's weird isn't because we don't want to live with globalization and homogenization were cultural. Corporatism is coming uniform for our world, but also there are many, many, many disparate experiences, but on some level as human beings, if we are anatomically as similar as we are, perhaps it's safe to assume that we're psychologically comparatively similar like you know, even though you and I also so different body types or whatever and look sort of at a glance kind of dealing with both. Ultimately you've got the same organs with running in pretty much the same way or perhaps we have the same psychological Palette, so throughout the world people are.

Speaker 1:          00:04:19       Everyone's having a very similar experience of being human. The anxiety of not being good enough, the fear of death, constantly looking for something in the outside world that's gonna solve the problems that's going to answer your questions and like in a lot of these ancient texts that I've mostly got at fruit, Joseph Campbell or you know, Hinduism for beginners, that's normally my entry point. I like Uma auto didact, self taught person. That's one of the things I love about your podcast is that can you can hear you. This is a person educated themselves and continuing to educate themselves through life. Well, like one of the things that are picked up in that. It's like the Indian very, very ancient texts. There are people that the same way as in our, like in our our time that's defined by science and technology. There were times where people define themselves through meditation and experiences in income, in consciousness.

Speaker 1:          00:05:05       Like those people that wrote say the upanishads, whoever the hell they were. These ratios, these ancient Indian yogis that when into deep, deep meditative states and came back with mantras and truves. Those people are as diligent and as fastidious as a scientist in a laboratory that comes back and goes, well look, we've, you know, we've broke down, you know, Watson and Crick break it down the DNA. They come back and go, this is what it is to be human. You are going to die. You need to get. You need to come to terms with the relationship between your contract sale for new material self. That's the. For me, that's the stuff like that's the conversation that I'm into and that's why whenever I find it, wherever it comes from Joseph Campbell or young or even checking out this podcast, like a lot of stuff can hancock Graham in Cox into that. Always a pressie something deep in me. That's why I'm always looking for, you know, Joe, the moment we think that shutter you get there's truth in there, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       Well those pass that you're talking about, those paths that are carved in that we. We sort of normalize all the experiences that we have so they look totally, totally sane. If you just straight off those paths and jump into that Lake and freeze your Dick off and get out and you just do. Why did I do that? What are you. You broke your little Jane, the little chain of programming that's going on in your brain. You did something completely unusual and sometimes just little things like that little deviations off of that path will take you into a completely different place.

Speaker 3:          00:06:28       Are you still doing that kind of thing in your life now?

Speaker 2:          00:06:32       Yeah, sure. That all the time with wherever it's the cryo chambers or the isolation tanks or the experiences with WESCO and ask it, but I've done a lot of dmt with the more potent, shorter lasting form. Obviously I've read accounts on it. I've never done it. I'm in recovery, so allegedly things can be rearranged if you're in recovery. The problem with recovery is, you know, uh, if you want to maintain complete and total sobriety, the only way to allegedly have that experience, and apparently it is possible is through Kundalini and. But according to people I know that have done both, they've done dmt and they've also done Kundalini. It's virtually the same thing. I'm like, God can be reaching. Yeah. You just have to be completely dedicated to the Kundalini practice. You know, you have to go to a very specific state that's achievable once you have some mastery. Over the meditation and the Yoga Principles,

Speaker 3:          00:07:32       I've done a fair bit of that. Kundalini Yoga, Bang into it. In fact, this toe on my forefinger here is an illustration by Carl Young of the Kundalini serpent. The energy to come rises up. Your animal energy can become the coronated serp and bloodier getting that toe down and I woke up in the middle of the night, severely regretting it. Oh my thing go. Why did I do that? Mostly because Mark Mahoney, the La tattooist that became sort of somewhat besotted with him because he would kind of like some sort of living skeleton Elvis guy. He mean so, so sort of charming and enchanting. I kept getting myself just silica him out. He appeared briefly in that film, black mass, that Johnny Depp Film. I don't know if you saw it. I didn't see the soldier. That movie. Yeah, he's. He has a cameo. In the beginning of that you sort of got blue ringtail was hey, just sort of a fascinating guy and a literal, you know, art is the proper tattoo artist.

Speaker 3:          00:08:25       People you know, he's fast at these diode, like gangster crime overlords presidents. Everybody's done sort of like a lot of people, but he's got a very easy way and it's sort of a gentle kindness. He told me this story once. God, I wonder if you'd mind me repeating this in the media world when it used to be an intravenous junkie. He was in New York City and then you'd like wandering along on the way to a party and he saw a homeless fellow doing paint, Indonesia sort of for me and I'll get those paintings and he bought these paintings off this homeless guy and then he went onto this part and then he went and shot up in the bathroom and then he heard a flurry of excitement at this

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       New York party because Andy Warhol, Andy Warhol was arriving at the Party and Warhol came upstairs and he said he could hear like the acolytes around war, how and he said he had. He just banged up and he's getting a hit and his eyes are rolling and he's feeling fantastic and here's warhol outside the room. And Mark Mahoney had left some of his paintings out there along with the works of that homeless guy. And he goes, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Oh my God, that's amazing. Like looking at this stuff. And he goes, wow, look at me. I'm the coolest guy in the world is Mark Mahoney. I'm laying here banging up, smack in a bathroom wall, house out there, dig in my work, and of course when he went out it was the homeless guy. Stuff into. Yeah, he's a man with an anecdote or two. I love that guy. Your coffee's good, mate.

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       I'm passing my tits. Don't know what I'm saying. So amazingly powerful for you. This is it because I'm drug free for 13 years, Joe and. Oh, so as I was saying Kundalini, I've done a lot. I couldn't and ever take you to a crazy psychedelic state as I did when I was using drugs. I did psychedelics and it's. I've never had that kind of like, oh my God, because I loved drugs. But you never had a breakthrough moment on psychedelics. Yeah, I had that realization. What are considered to be myself was a construction and it wasn't real, but like my memories and my perception and my desires are just a conglomeration of biochemical impulses that Pew, that I'm merely a conduit of pure consciousness. Then that's too heavy to deal with when you're bloody 16. All my mates were just doing it at school and like, you know, carrying on like me, I need to do psychedelics at the hospital where a person monitoring my heart going to be all right. I can't do it under normal conditions. So. How old were you? You weren't clean the 27. So from 27 or nothing. Just coughing. I'm 41. Yeah, coffee. Of course. I was a sort of a, you know, pretty committed sex addict for a decade. You might want to dip your feet back in the pond. So you say this job, this is the problem is with me is I don't know what your experience. I know where your addictive tendencies come out.

Speaker 2:          00:10:59       Well, I have them for sure, but uh, where do they come out? Um, games or get addicted really badly to games, video games, archery. I'm addicted very badly to shooting bows and arrows and he used to be cool. Yeah. Yeah. Shoot. Yeah, I'm pretty good at it. Robin Hood Style. Well, I don't use a recurve bow or use a compound bow, like a very complicated high powered apparatus. Shoots very accurately out to 70, 80, 90 yards, but uh, I practice it all the time. Yeah, it's fascinating. It's a very. It's a meditation. Yeah. Yeah. Because there's something about when you require so much concentration when you're pulling a pullback and anchoring and relaxing and centering the bow and making sure everything's level and relaxed and there's no excess movement whatsoever. As you release the Arrow. It's all this very, very difficult little dance of the synapses that you're doing.

Speaker 2:          00:11:50       And in that dance, there's no room for any extraneous thought. You think about your bills, your bullshit, your life death. You don't think about anything but no movement. Release that Arrow. Absolutely properly watched it sink into the Bullseye and when you do it, it's incredibly satisfying. It must be made. Is there some visualization involved in that? Yeah, you definitely. And a lot of people who will actually get better from not even practicing. They get better from visualizing. More than practicing. Yeah. That they just, they just go over the actual physical mechanics of the shot, visualize it locking in, but it's a big thing with competitive target archers, the visualization aspect. They go to hypnotists and they really work on like a very specific pattern that they visualize, like a very specific pattern of drawing the bow back, finding your anchor point, perfect release Arrow flying perfectly, and in doing that they sort of conditioned their mind and their body to make that perfect shot over and over and over again, but it's so difficult to do that.

Speaker 2:          00:12:49       Even the best people fuck up the best ones in the world and the Olympic archery, they'll occasionally, you know, get out of the line and get a nine or an eight and they just, they don't know why they'd been doing it seven hours a day for fucking 20 years. It doesn't matter. It's so difficult that it net you. There's no mastery. You never totally master it. There's variable. You've got to be addicted. If you go into a hypnotist and try to hit bullseye, man, well imagine if that was your light in it. Imagine if that was how you made a living, how much you make, and to be a narrative. It's a good question. I mean, I know there's the Olympics, right, and so you can get sponsors from both companies like [inaudible] and companies that sell arrows and things along those lines, and it's. It's a, it's a practice that a lot of people engage in, so I would imagine it's probably more money than you think there is.

Speaker 2:          00:13:36       Okay. But yeah, I just haven't seen it. Even at the fairs are towards your drawers for. Here's the tricky thing is this doesn't. It's not like, like if you're. If you're a professional boxer, you have a very specific set of skills. Right? Right. You know how to box floyd mayweather is pretty. God Damn sure he knows exactly what the fuck he's doing, but this isn't like boxing, like anybody. You can teach anybody to do this, right? It doesn't take any ridiculously coordinated athletic movements, some unusual genetic, some fast twitch muscle fibers. Now you just pull the bow back and you release the Arrow. So to make a living doing that, to decide that I'm going to do something that I could teach anybody to do in a day. I can take any regular person and work on their footwork, their stance rather and their positioning and teach them how to shoot an hour.

Speaker 2:          00:14:22       Yeah. Breathing out of concentrate and relax. You can get them shooting fairly proficiently inside of four or five hours. Now imagine taking that to a level where you're going to travel the world and compete and just shoot at Bulls eyes for your kids food. That's what I'm saying. It's a bunch of other people that are no different than you. There's. I know a lot of those guys. I know quite a few of those guys who introduced me. I will introduce you for sure. Love to meet a professional guy that I'll introduce you to. The Guy who trained me, John Dudley. Next time he's in La and you're in La, we'll make it happen. He's a

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       good dude. I want to learn about that madness. Well, Zealand motivation. Jimbo to unravel this man. Oh no person who's devoted their life to hitting the bullseye that led him to this point of mastery. Don't make you feel insecure about the hypnosis session. Do you do yoga at all? Ma'Am? Do like regular yoga or Kundalini, how often you do it? I try and do yoga two or three, like my exercise regimen change. Not entirely unrelated to listening to your podcast. I like now do kickboxing once a week. I do Jujitsu once a week and honestly it's influenced me. My Mate Nick got me into your podcast and a lot of people that I hang out with like, you know, sort of in there as you obviously know, but even in the UK, in the mixed martial art world, this is a very central cultural artifact and how it intersects with thinking outside the box and a new vision of what it is to be a man and living outside of sort of state ideals and air conditioning.

Speaker 1:          00:15:52       You know? And that's very, very, I'm, that's what I'm fascinated about is these new, like new ways of being a man like ha, having tend to nurse awareness awakeness but not being afraid or indeed ashamed of the aspects of masculinity that have somehow become cleverly maligned over the last few generations. So like may I say like a shout out to the northwest and Paul busby because they're the people side terminal people that I do like. That's a shout out to them. I felt I was ridiculous there for English and it was a hate crime. You saw that. I was giving them a shout out. Oh right. No, that's actually. That's another great one. And there's no. There's no doubt that the English accent is the greatest accent. That's why I use it for all noble movies. Any time there's a god or any sign there, you're speaking in a foreign language that we've translated to English.

Speaker 1:          00:16:44       They have an English accent or anything. Thrones, gladiator, everybody squats revolutions after all of your economic success and Global Dominion when it comes to an authority figure used to come down from on the heart, you still can't have God. God is actually still have a sort of sense of realness, game of thrones, reverence for the regal, but they're all. They all speak some strange language during some place with dragons. It's all artificial, right? But yet they all speak with an English accent. No reason why they should not be from Detroit. Yeah. Why? Why don't they speak, hey, you fucking guys were coming over here trying to fuck our broad fucking balls and it's good. Well, it's fucking dragons in Shane. Black in your dragons ask you to leave the court because you've really loved the tone some lot. So it's like the opposite of going off the course. It's going so deep into the chorus that everyone's wearing powdered wigs and they're all aligning with some ancient scrolls that they've pulled out of a jar and a fucking cave and come somewhere and it

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       has been decreed. And you say everything's going to be proper.

Speaker 3:          00:17:53       Yeah, he's getting deep. That's what I count on you guys for you English properly and rely on us from now the time in memorial because he sort of burping during that stuff. Yeah. So that like I go do Jujitsu once a week at a level that you know, I mean I don't even know if it would qualify for, for the term Jujitsu at that level. Up and practicing at the moment. I've doing kickboxing where I had to go to what is called a leisure center to those words exist in nature center, like a gym, a community, one to do my, like white boy can see why MCA lined up with like 10 year olds do in life to get my white belt just to get on the ladder. I do know, I mean I've done that quite recently and as well as that I do do yoga, so I'm so I'm using this time.

Speaker 3:          00:18:34       I've stepped out of the madness of Los Angeles. The Madness of media that like, you know, the intensity of it, you know, during the time of what was like in another thing that you talks about is the shadow self. All the. I am not. I also am. If you think of that as I suppose a simpler way of saying that is I've lived this life that's been very focused on comedy and the pursuit of individual success. Think what are all the things I've not done as a result of that? Like when I was a king and he's shy and too ashamed to get into sort of like sport type things, you know, and embarrassed and all that kind of thing, so you have to start to do kickboxing or Jujitsu and even football or soccer as you call it here, you know, like to do all of those things now to start to learn about them as an adult man, it's a beautiful

Speaker 2:          00:19:16       thing when you take chances and do things with other people that are take chances and chances and doing new things because you realize that it's really. A lot of it is about the sort of acceptance and the embracing of vulnerability. When you learn a new thing, it's very important to learn new things

Speaker 3:          00:19:31       that it is that you. Because I hear you say that and I know what that means, but the you actually could like I got so much prejudice is about you as a sort of a black belt. Martial law is then as someone who is embedded in the MMA mma world, you are a person who is happy and accepting of vulnerability. Where in your life do you feel that you are in embracing that vulnerability in

Speaker 2:          00:19:55       every. Every time you try something new? I enjoy. I'm like in the archery thing, I've only been doing it for four years, but one of the things that I really loved about is how fucking terrible I was when I first started and it was like there's, there's something to this that I have to figure out. Yoga is a big one. I've been really serious into yoga like where I go several times a week at least once a week for about a year and a couple months, a year and like two months or something like that. And one of the things that I really enjoy about it is that I'm not very good and I still get nervous before class. Fuck man. Yeah, it's weird. There's something. It's one of those weird places, like a yoga class is one of those weird places where there's almost a sacredness to it. Like you, you go in there and no one can leave until the class is over.

Speaker 2:          00:20:38       Like they tell you, they lock the front door and no one comes in to visit the studio. Everything's locked in. No one watches. You go in there and we don't talk. No one talks. You don't talk for 90 and you go through this series of poses that are incredibly difficult. You're sweating like pounds and pounds of water up. I mean I'll, I'll weigh myself before and after. I'll be down like four or five pounds just from one class and it's very difficult, but it makes me nervous, you know? I do get nervous before I do it because it has this. I think it's difficult to do. I think I don't necessarily physically enjoy it while it's happening, but I enjoy the effects after it's over. But I think it definitely imparts a feeling of vulnerability.

Speaker 3:          00:21:17       Hmm. Because I always issue that if you are really good at this is perhaps you know, because of where I come from, I always assumed that if you are date good at some sort of fight in thing, that that is a highly transferable skill like that. And I don't mean in a practical way, if you're good at kickboxing, you will also be good at yoga. I just mean if you're good at kickboxing, you don't give a shit that you're not good at yoga. My assumption is if you're good at yoga, the yoga side, you're not meant to say you're good at Yoga. But giovan could it sort of like when I'm in the MMA gym, start guiding like, well, you may be strangling me now, my man, but wait till we get to down with dog. No, I sort of feel that. All right. Live humility into Jujitsu situation for a beginner is an absolute humility. He recognized, you know, because I'm dealing with people that are good and like, you know, they have to do it like they're doing it for a little kid, you know, like, and I'm very aware that they're doing that

Speaker 2:          00:22:16       well. I think that if you get really good at martial arts, the only way to get really good is to be completely objective about where you are. And if you're completely objective about where you are and learning and trying to improve upon your skills, you apply that same feeling towards everything else. So the feeling that you get when you totally vulnerable in martial arts, you apply that same feeling when you're learning yoga because that's the only way to get really good at it. The only way to really do it to 100 percent do it. It's not to sit here and go, this doesn't mean shit because I could choke on it,

Speaker 3:          00:22:43       but in this going to help you, it's not going to help you at all. Matter of fact,

Speaker 2:          00:22:47       it'll hurt you, it'll hurt you, and it'll focus more on your own ego instead of the ego dissolving. Beneficial properties of the poses.

Speaker 3:          00:22:55       Oh, drew and the ambience in the yoga studio. I would say that out loud doesn't mean shit. I could choke everyone in this room.

Speaker 2:          00:23:04       Well know I could fuck you up. So settle down. Don't get crazy about you're stretching.

Speaker 3:          00:23:08       I don't know if you've read the scriptures, but there is no guidance. Quite a little foreign. And it's usually a metaphor.

Speaker 2:          00:23:16       That was the thing that Mckenna always talk about that that's really what a lot of the ancient yogis were about. They were about smoking chillums of Hash and then doing all these poses and if you've ever done yoga while intoxicated on edible, the edible variety in particular marijuana. It's a beautiful thing.

Speaker 3:          00:23:33       I haven't because I only started yoga because I'd stopped in a hash and all other drugs. You know like when the thing is with me mate is when I was taking drugs, that was what I was doing. There wasn't room for. Now I might pop to yoga. You were fucking pro. I was a full time dedicated pro 100 percent. That's it. Everyday, you know, can't do. It was the amount. What was the big drug was the problem. I progressed through an escalation of drug use. That could be on any republican leaflet case, stone smoke pot or you will become a heroin addict. That's literally what I did. Like I started with recreational drugs was unable to properly. The reason is this because it's not the fault of the drugs themselves. There's a component within me that he's looking to find a solution that doesn't happen.

Speaker 3:          00:24:24       You see when you have that perspective on guy and in a place and being willing to go in there and be vulnerable. That kind of thing. For me, that makes me very sort of what are called hot, you know, like scared like that or fuck fuck tiffany drugs were always a thing that I trusted to make me feel a little bit better light and so when I was smoking weed, it's like, all right, there's that thing I've found that makes me feel relaxed when coke and heroin and crack. It was the same reason. It was an attempt to nullify, medicate and contend with an innocent of disconnectedness and discontentment, which I think is a thing that comes up a lot on your show in other guys because I think that's in some way or another, we're all looking for the sense of connection, the sense of completion.

Speaker 3:          00:25:04       I think in fact, the thing that led me to be a drug addict or a sex addict gambler, wherever kind of addict you are, I think the thing that's driving it is this need for connection. The sense that if this life, because it don't fucking seem right to me now this system like give me the real deal. What's the real thing you're not telling me? And that's why I'm fascinated by people. Like terrence Mckenna says, like if you. You know what he dunks down the pedestrian levels of consciousness. There's this deep, deep shit down there. There's fascinating stuff. There's machine elves, there's corridors of kaleidoscopic wonder to explore. There's union, there's God.

Speaker 4:          00:25:41       You know, for garlic, you maybe the best art. That might be the best argument for trying to do with the Kundalini way because you have to earn it, right?

Speaker 3:          00:25:48       I knew it'd be harder for me. I've got, I've got to do it by sort of stretching and sort of aggressive breathing. Instead of hitting that dmt shit

Speaker 4:          00:25:59       into my leathery old lungs. Just take three. You just take three and then you sit back and tell me what you see at the end. In about 15 minutes. You can't. You can't, can't be described beyond language to describe it. It's just my stubby fucking stupid ape fingers trying to draw God with a crayon on a patch of dirt. It's not even a proper canvas problem of all religions can. It's just a question. If you do see what you were actually looking for, what do you think is curious once you there and you discover what, what do you come back and aren't we just backed all of this

Speaker 3:          00:26:34       even? No, you're right in waiting, but because I have had moments in both sobriety recovery, Andy in active addiction where I've gone, Oh God, I feel truly connected now. I've had a lot of those moments in what I would call unhealthy high. It's like, you know, sort of sexual kind of, Oh my God, this is so amazing. I want to live in this moment forever. Or moments on drugs where I felt sort of pure bliss, but nowadays I tend to find it through bloody altruism and kindness and service. Like sometimes when I think I'm being truly useful, I feel this sense of connection, but you are right, it is not sustainable. There is no Viagra for enlightenment. You can't sort of stay hard. You know what I mean? You sort of, you feel like, oh, that's it. I understand it right from this moment for virome, enlightened, I'm.

Speaker 3:          00:27:15       That's it. I'm never going to be anybody's bitch again. I'm never going to do anything straight for the money. I'm never going to care what other people think about me ever again. It's actually, it's behind me, but then someone will say something or someone will do something enough back here again, I think it's very hard to capture the divine. You know? I think you'd get like I've had in my life moments of it. I think when I do the yoga, I practice yoga on my own practice, yoga this morning and positions where you go upside down and stuff and I think you would if he was just determined to describe things in a material and secular way, you'd say, well, you would just dizzy, you know, but what I feel is I go upside down and when I come up straight again, I feel my own individual consciousness.

Speaker 3:          00:27:53       My sense of myself. I feel it sort of disappeared. Like I can't remember who I am for a moment. It all goes away and then I feel this secondary awareness in the back of my mind. Like I sort of a grid and awareness. There's a nice sort of thing. Hold on a minute, I'm not me. I'm not me. There's something else inside of me and the thing that in a might big sort of ax to grind. When I was doing that, that Internet series the truth for a while. That got me into all sorts of interesting scrapes and challenges over the last sort of 18 months, two years. It was the idea of someone inside our own consciousness is not free. We are not free within our own consciousness. We have been conditioned to the point that we don't know that we're conditioned anymore and I think that that sort of, you know, that's you. You notice it in lightening rod moments when there is sort of like an election and you think, oh my God, people really in his fucking shit what is going on my rage cage.

Speaker 4:          00:28:52       Perfect riff to at that moment. Thank you very much this way. Yeah. Is that rage against the machine? Is that person smashing? Smashing pumpkin. I don't limit. Can I ask you, since [inaudible] you found your outlet. You said you're putting you finding just good. Something good? Yeah. Have you. I'm just a question since you've been putting it out there and have you noticed this more and more is coming back or it's like, Eh, I'm noticing it more always was there. I just chose go the way to know. These are just questions.

Speaker 3:          00:29:24       Well my right eye. It still like if you read any bloody, when you read this stuff in religious books like saying the Bible is going to become good and get to the point where even being good, you're not even doing it for that reason anymore. You've become detached from outcomes. You know the. In Buddhist terms, you know like that you're, you're no longer about fear and desire. You no longer trying to just fulfill yourself. Right? I'm not bloody there yet. You know me, even if I do something good like go a homeless shelter and help out for the day and all that sort of thing, a little bit of the back of my mind is going to helping out at this homeless shelter and if someone went by and saw me helping at the homeless shelter, been really pleased. Why is no one seeing me helping these fucking ownership.

Speaker 3:          00:30:13       So I'm still a little bit looking for rewards now that that's very hard. But this is the thing is as well about being a comedian is you can't get to fucking sincere and earnest. Do you stop being bloody funny. You know what I mean? But then you find that that when you stuff that you really passionate about and you really believe in because comedy, I think he's constantly ripping down the, you know, you sort of set up a premise and then you rip it down again. I think comedy is the energy of constantly going. None of this is really. No, this is all bullshit. It's all fucking bullshit. So when you're sincere, you please hold on, hold on. Stop it. No, this is serious. That's more kids will care about them. Once you do that,

Speaker 2:          00:30:47       be able to differentiate between your forms of expression, like your art form, like a piece that you're creating and you yourself as a person. And sometimes I used to think when I was younger, man, I can't be fucking around with meditation or enlightenment because it's going to ruin me. All my favorite comedians were junkies and crazy people like in and prior and Hicks and crazy people and junkies. You can't get enlightened. You gotta you gotta just gotTa fucking be a wild man. That's how you get comedy. I'm not so convinced anymore. And I think the creating of these memes and, and these, these characters that you can mock and make fun of inside your act is a piece of art. You're doing something just like a painting doesn't make you a madman. You could paint a Frazetta, Conan the barbarian painting. It doesn't make you a mass murderer. You know what I'm saying? It's like you're creating a piece of art and sometimes the more points of view that you've considered, the more it enhances that work of art.

Speaker 3:          00:31:42       You raise a good point in that because in certain sectors of the art world that has always been accepted that you know, erroneous Bosch triptych of hell don't mean, oh man, this guy's fucking crazy. You know, they may have been, I don't know or you know, but like when in hip hop, you know, like people talk about, you know, popping caps and whatnot. It's taken a lot more literally and it. And as a comedic persona like that, he's gonna comedians get a lot, but it British comedian as well. There's a few sort of like comedians, myself, a Scottish comedian called Frankie Boyle like that when people are very shocking, like you know, like, like you can, I can tell sometimes that comics are saying things to detonate territory's of consciousness. Fuck you knew because it might get lucky. Wakes you up. Bill Hicks did that a lot. I think he would say things. You go whoa, steady and then these smacked you in the mouth and then he's like, he gently tells you that it's just the ride or wherever it is, you know, like now that you've got you where wants you. But people like I think we live in a culture now that's very prohibitive about where we go with those kind of idea. So people are very quick. I've myself been on the receiving end of a lot of like what I want to say judgment and I'm not fucking joking but don't.

Speaker 2:          00:32:57       That's also because we live in this new media world of social interaction, this new social media world where anybody can chime in at any point in time and it's the first time ever that that's happened.

Speaker 3:          00:33:07       Yeah, you might be right, but a friend of mine in England made a documentary about what has happened to the idea of the great man, you know, like in American literature, like, you know, Saul Bellow Philip Roth or like, you know, Mohammed Ali, uh, rest in peace like that. Nowadays, people don't rise to that position anymore because there's thousands of Lilliputians pulling them down as soon as there is above the parapet and no one's allowed to. Yeah, yeah. People will be, oh, well Martin Luther King had affairs on Malcolm x. He was inside. He done this, that, and the other. You know, like, it's like the, the. Yeah, I, there were so many good things that have come from social media. So many good things, you know, the possibility of communication, that connection and instantaneous, all those things. This is wonderful, but it does all, all things in the end become an expression of the dominant consciousness, you know, and if people are doubtful, cynical, president mystic in that, the Palette that she ends up on the canvas,

Speaker 2:          00:34:03       it also might be a case of, you know, everybody's always worried about wealth inequality in this world. There's also a possibility of consciousness, inequality and that these people that have grown up with shitty parents and shitty neighborhoods, they feel left out by even your ability to seek peace and altruism. Like, who are you this guy? Why are you so lucky? You're financially fortunate. You have beautiful genes. You're handsome, you have a wonderful magazine, fucking magazine shop. I go get your face. I mean I love you dude, but come on, Bang and started off this motherfucker. And so why is he so happy? Why is he allowed to have this happiness come to him so easily? So there's anger at that. The same kind of anger that you would get at the elite upper class, like the billionaires in the one percenters of the world. People will also look at a person like you and like there's a consciousness inequality, there's a, there's also a starting point.

Speaker 2:          00:34:55       Inequality, you know, you know, I'm sure you, like you were saying you were insecure when you're young and it was difficult than I certainly was and Jim and I knew each other when we're young and insecure and starting out as comics. We've been friends forever, but that, that sort of this, this experience where you are, you now and people look at that and they're upset that, well, why is this guy have so much? Why is this guy in this place where you can so conveniently search for truth where I have to pay my fucking bills, student loans, and I'm in a Shitty neighborhood and my kids are sick and my wife account, you know, this is this. And then they get on twitter and the like, fuck you, you fucking cunt. I hope your ponytail chokes you and your right.

Speaker 3:          00:35:37       Well, it never will because I'll put it into a button. I can actually understand that level of discontentment because to be honest, I, you know, I'm subject to jealousy and envy myself. I spot it when it comes up, when I sort of feel myself go, oh, why is that not me? I should be having that. But now I try to. I try not to justify feeling shit. Know as soon as I start feeling bad, I don't think, well this is why I feel bad and I'd like to stay feeling bad if I try and go, hold on a minute that I, if I, if you believe that you know, the external world is an illusion that it's temporary, it's transient and real is your deep connection to your inner self and you can express that myriad ways and we're here to after this experience as an animal and I'm fascinated by the numerous ways that you are into doing it and it's something that I really want to learn more about, you know, loads of the stuff that goes on on your show, but like, yeah, I can, I can well appreciate people sort of seeing a.

Speaker 3:          00:36:32       yeah. Particularly as the way it's presented, seen me on the like on television thinking, fuck that guy, fuck that guy because they don't automatically know where I came from or what I had to do to get here, or the fact that I get here and take. Hold on a minute. This isn't why full. It will be almost as soon as I got those things. I was like, this isn't real. If you can't make yourself, you know, like the, I don't want to be poor again. I'll be straight about that because I hate it. It is pretty frightening, but like it's. You cannot resolve those inner issues. I now know that empirically for a fact. I'm really lucky and that's why I'm so fascinated by the addiction model and that's why I'm reluctant to smash my mind's piece of DMT though. It does sound fun. I would really, really love to do it on pier pussy.

Speaker 3:          00:37:11       I'll do it for you. Say I'm in is because I know I've tried fame, I've tried money, I tried drugs, I tried sex. I tried all of those things to make myself feel better and oddly none of them have worked. None of them have worked. I'm not. Oh, poor me. Poor me. What is fucking refugee crisis? You just about your experience. Yeah. Yeah, and I would like what I am now thinking Joe is what is the Mo they say that, you know, happiness is where, what the world needs meets what you have to offer, where we can meet, well needs, meet what you have to offer, and I think God is there a way that I can communicate some of the things that I have learned about connecting, about letting go of my floors, taking responsibility for the problems that I am creating, you know, like is there anything about that that I can convey kind of conveyed hopefully as we were in a comedic and accessible way and that sort of like where my focus is beginning to fall now I'm assuming that's what you're already doing. I'm attempting.

Speaker 2:          00:38:09       I mean everybody. I think everybody is trying to better themselves as attempting some form of that, but it's also what you're dealing with when you're talking about the criticism of you. They're trying to define you based on one interview or one, one article or one thing that you said in response to one piece of current events, so it's real quote mining a lot of times in a lot of ways. Looking to have a more concentrated form of that, that jealous expression we were talking about like fine,

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       like it's gotta be something about this guy I don't like. That's it. I don't like how he went on Fox News and mocked America. Hey, you mocking the journalism. Yeah. You think you're better than these people that are here and telling the truth. Well, I think the way that works for me is that that is a thing that is called confirmation bias, isn't it? You've already feeling something inside yourself and then you'll sort of unconsciously you're scanning data to get confirmation of like. So if I feel insecure because you're super good at MMA and have black bolts in Jujitsu, I like, instead of dealing with my own feeling of fuck, if this becomes a fire, I'm not going to have to deal with it. I would rather go, wow, this guy's like, I'll find something to complete the had advantages that I didn't have if I had this I would've been like in.

Speaker 1:          00:39:20       But, but really the feeling is in me, and this is what might personal experience of actually getting clean from drugs has taught me, is that, you know, what other people think about me is none of my business and it's something that's happening in their own consciousness and they're always looking for some coordinates upon which to project those feelings. And I know that because I fucking knew it when I, if I start getting jealous about, you know, super awesome, super successful guy or someone who's super good at fighting or whatever, that's I'm dealing with something inside myself. So now I try not to bring that shit to the world and trying to go. Right? Russell, you bet. Deal with this feeling of inadequacy or this feeling of jealousy or this feeling of insecurity because what was just going to ruin your experience of being human instead of going, no, the problem is this guy or that guy or this person having a successful podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:40:01       I tried to go, none of Russell connect with yourself, you know, I'm trying not to blame the outside world for my shit and yeah, these are really complicated thoughts that we have and in many ways we're almost a victim of this constant need to evolve like the body and the brain is set up to constantly be comparing ourselves to others and to feed off of each other, whether it's through jealousy or inspiration to try to achieve higher and higher levels of competency at anything, to develop more social credibility, to develop more clout in the community, to, to feel better about your own existence. It's almost like what we're dealing with is some sort of a programming that is constantly set up to innovate and to continue to get better and better at everything. So yeah, if I see you in some movie, am I. where Am I?

Speaker 1:          00:40:49       How come I'm not in these fucking movies? I don't even get these auditions. I need a farmland manager. These ideas, they. They motivate movement, they motivate momentum and yes you could use them or not using, but we don't. We don't know how to handle them and no one's telling us in. Our parents didn't tell us and their parents didn't tell them shit. Back to the slavery. We're all just tribal and at the end of the day, what you supposed to do is help others. There's no better feeling in the world then encouraging another human to live right and they live right. Those are moments you remember live good judge, and your Dick Sucked and the lyrics while you're pouring champagne on both of you. Oh No, that is relaxing background

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       check. That's quicker. If you can't get a learjet debate, I am going to take that out of your mouth. You, you mean a good point because what you're doing right there is how biological imperatives, wherever that force was, that made us divide from one cell to two cells to 10 sales, to the frog, to Malmo, to cities to woolies and wonders. That falls, as you say, still in us now, these, these imperatives to grow, that's the, you know that as a you sign an agent, but as if you're living in a tribal society, it's a necessary function, but what's happened to our species? Because you know that father, that cliche you are what you eat. You know what it means. If you eat shit food, you'll be shit and I hundred percent agree with that, but on a, on a different, in a different way. You are what you eat.

Speaker 3:          00:42:20       If you look at what we eat now, we mono cultural foods. You know like we're in a suedes endless fields of wheat across again. Got It. Drove what state would that have been? Drove fruit, like there's one of your crazy Iowa, Nebraska, Nebraska, nothing, but it was like the whole country was made of it. Just know what else is there. Go on Jesus. Oh, I love that guy. Now he's guilty, but do you understand what he was saying? The May. The main thing that I think he was saying was, don't be gay. That's what I like, so just be cool. He said what? He said, yeah, a lot of people have missed the point, but this big cool thing, it's done again. It's focused down on not big guy, and then of course the way that the meat is consumed, endless apa towards and slaughter houses have condensed animals not consumed as they would be tribally picked off here and there even once a week. I'm a vegetarian myself, but you know, so we have fields full of wheat. Abbotts was full of meat and we ourselves are similarly what we eat. We have become cells of energy trapped in cities. Not Free to be tribal beings anymore. We've become so disconnected from what it's supposed to be to be this primate that now these biological imperative, the desire to procreate, the desire to have status, that the, the desire to even get high, all these things have become permutate it because they're no longer anchored in the reality for which we were design.

Speaker 2:          00:43:51       I imagine your position where you are in a completely unique position, even in the Western world, you become a media superstar. You become a movie star. He becomes someone when you show up, people have cameras and you walk and they take photos of you. You get out of a car and everyone cheers. It becomes this really unusual event when you just arrived somewhere. So it sets you up for an incredibly high dose of this sort of toxic celebrity feeling that you have to sort of navigate and you have to navigate it based on the other people that have mostly unsuccessfully navigated it before you start and think about how many fucking movie stars wind up in a pool their own or you know, covered in whatever the fuck they're doing it. I mean, it's a, it's a large number of famous people wind up fucking it all up, but they can't handle it anymore. They go, he's ledger or a million different ways, you know, pills are just fucking implosion or whatever the fuck it is. Would you like to feed my giraffe? This is the podcast for you. Start losing your mind

Speaker 3:          00:44:54       in the van. For anyone that's listening to this podcast, just because I'm on it and I can't imagine there's very many of you. There's a reference there to a giraffe that even I'm struggling.

Speaker 2:          00:45:03       It's. I just think that your unique perspective and it's a very unique perspective because not a lot of people get to become movie stars, is it's something that the average person, they are trying to put it into perspective where they can grasp the amount of pressure and the weird way that you have to interface with the world where people worship you and everywhere you go people love you and you don't even know them. That's a very strange thing.

Speaker 3:          00:45:30       This is the thing. We have to think of problems. I think in terms of their essence, not of their scale, you see like because if you like how I stopped myself, like, you know, when I was more immersed in Hollywood and fame and stuff, I like, it isn't like you walk in a room and like when I was single and a lots of attention from women, obviously that that's a short circuit that because you do tend to fulfill that one. You said, Oh my God, I'm able to have sex with.

Speaker 2:          00:45:54       Awesome. Let's dig sense. All of a sudden they want, you know, how did that happen? That was amazing. It was like, it was hurting of the natural process. Matrix is broken. Oh my God. I'm fucking. Yeah, I lost my wonder why you're an addict. It's normal, but every look it's called pussy is awesome. That is a difficult problem. To overwhelmed. It's impossible. It's impossible to avoid the pool. I mean, you talking about the gravity of Jupiter, it's sucks and asteroids. I mean, that's what it is. It's just too goddamn strong. The compulsion to breed and the compulsion to be special so that you can breed more than anyone else and you can have the choice. That's what your DNA calls, but can we overcome our nature? You have, you have. You have a podcast I've ever been in my life. What you're doing, you've decided to step away from all the bullshit, move away from Hollywood and sort of take a break while you can financially and you can with your position in life and just relax and get a look at this because it don't look at it from afar.

Speaker 3:          00:46:56       Maybe the ego thing of like people giving you those attention. Why used to. Oh, like quite quickly after. Like I used to get a lot of fame attention. I would think if someone else more famous than me came in, then all these attention would go there. So what is it really well is it really is not it. I can't feed on that and even if I don't have that, even if I don't literally have the experience of being of basking in a spotlight and then Justin timberlake walking in and seeing the light disappear from my face and being punished once again into the shadows of my youth. Even if I don't have to actually have that experience, I know that when I get home, I'm still just that none of it is real that you can't. There's no nutrition in it. There's nothing we ended. You can't get any.

Speaker 3:          00:47:35       It's not like, oh, this, this amount of fame hasn't worked. I'll try and get even more famous is because the essence is the thing. The essence is the thing is to try to connect what I am doing or what you are doing or what one is doing to something that is connected that feels beautiful to you, that fills nutritional to you and that. For me that is really, really odd because it's very hard to enjoy those pat on the back things. Particularly if you know, like if you felt inadequate and insecure in Adelaide, it's very hard to break off of that track course and I'll feel lucky, but it's not something that it's not over for me. If feel. I feel lucky to be awakening from that thing. I feel lucky to be awakening for her, but it's not over for me. I still feel it. You know? I still feel if someone, if another English committee, if Ricky Gervais' came in, now I'd have to go. Right. Okay. Ricky, JCC, Sacha Baron Cohen. Right now this is happening now. I'm aware that in this moment I have a cache of being the only English person in the West was, but it's not. You know, if those are the things I'm using a prop up my identity, I'm fucked.

Speaker 2:          00:48:35       But you being aware of those facts, aware of the fact that you're constantly struggling in this is what's going to help you. I mean, it's not like you can avoid the, the sound of the. What are the harpies one of those things and pull the sirens that call the boats into the rocks. Like it's, it's, it's compelling. It's absolutely compelling, but you understand what it is now so you don't have to do it. You don't have to gravitate towards it. Like you know you can. You know that if you just went and got a bunch of hookers and some coke and hold yourself up in a hotel room, there'd be some moments. It'd be pretty God damn good about that, but they're also, there'd be the repercussions, the fact that you've slid back towards addiction, the problem, so you avoid it. You know the pool is always going to be there, especially when the girls have big tits and little waist bigger ashes and put a secret.

Speaker 3:          00:49:25       Yes. Yes. It's a very difficult. That's why. That's why I live in the abstinence model that's. I tried to press those buttons because that's stuff is, you know, you can't miss route the cage. Don't wake that guy up. Leave him alone like hulk in it. Don't make me angry. Learned Lot and whenever I agree, just let me be a little hole.

Speaker 2:          00:49:42       Yeah, just let me chill. Yeah, I mean look, as we've gone over your navigating some waters that very few people get to go through and there's no books written about it. No one has gone through what you've done and achieved some sort of a yogic state of enlightenment where they've sort of expressed it to everybody else and said, this is, this is the roadmap. This is the path

Speaker 4:          00:50:01       I have to. I have to just say, just knowing some addicts to me, what you're doing is more powerful than when you were the ultimate ultimate star. Because I'm telling this guy sometimes. I mean, we all feel that way. I'll get really far for a little bit. I'll go, you know, I can't believe that guy. I'm trying to do this, and that guy, he's, I think he's 15 years now and he'll turn to me. Go, Jim, I've been to your house, have so much more. You have so much more in your life. You don't want. Trust me. You don't want that. It's a struggle, but when he says that, those statements are so powerful to make as he can see that that vanity and wanting to be. That's why I said the draft, because that defines my success. You know, success with I board the draft shipped here.

Speaker 4:          00:50:49       I'm faithful. That shit is worse than heroin. It's worse than her. I can't imagine his ladder was. Is it was. Was still is up here in a similar way here. That's a lot to live. I don't know. I tip my hat to you, but you would go through a tornado, but he's done it. You've done in a similar way as well in some his love, his level, but Jim was on Saturday night live is one of the best comedians in the country, is one of the best standup comics in the world. Really fucking crushes. He's so God damn funny, but he decided we'd been friends forever. He decided a long time ago, you know what? Fuck this. I'm going to live in New Jersey. I'm going to do gigs and I'm not going to worry about nothing. I'm just going to have a good time and perform and not worry about fame at all.

Speaker 4:          00:51:36       I'm just going to step the fuck away and just work on my act. Work on performing, having a good time of trying to enjoy my life and that's a very admirable thing to what you've done is a very admirable thing and a lot of ways I can. But when you first walked in here, you just kind of mentioned that and you said, um, suburbanized. I'm suburbanized you said that a couple times and indicated domestic kid. I'm sorry. You said domesticated. Don't have suburbs in England. No, you have the country and not that domesticated pit fall.

Speaker 4:          00:52:06       To me it's more, it's more you get more a gratitude out of it and the end of your days, those are the moment you can remember those little moments whether it was your, your friend or whatever. There's nothing wrong with that world and you can always come back one possibility. That's the problem though. I warned my wife. Tell like, listen, kids got a couple of years kids around in there and I tell them, don't get fuck pregnant man up 20 years from going ape shit and I will have that right to go ape shit. I watched my father, World War Two vet go into 18 years old and I watched them go, I'm just going to go ape shit. I don't give a shit about anything anymore. Um, so what you're doing is to me that's I'm cheering, cheering, cheer you on. Big Time. And I know this is Corny, but I saw you on a couple of interviews soon as you were.

Speaker 4:          00:52:54       I mean you were, you were all over the place and I could see. I can see you in that room trying to find who you were while everyone else was trying to throw out a completely different character. I, maybe I'm crazy and I'm going right now, but I, I would see that. I'm like, oh, well you had the awareness to say this is all weird. It feel weird. It's the weirdest way. Haired. How could it not be weird? You're a movie star. It's creepy. He's in a very unusual experience because it's like you were saying about going back to and sort of saying that, right?

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       What I'm going to do is my job, I'm going to do comedy and I do the comedy to get the money to pay for the food, to feed my family, to take care of my life and I love doing it and I can bring joy to people. They're like, I, I, if I'm honest about myself, I always had the ingredients for obsessive behavior. I was because like the more I look at it, I was trying to resolve something. I've thought if I get there, then I'll be worth something. I can get that thing and they know when I got there thought, hold on, this isn't eight reeve and real. It doesn't feel right to me. It doesn't feel right and that's not like, you know, there are people sort of I think very high profile, high level people that are making big contributions. Can you sweep away all of mainstream culture?

Speaker 3:          00:54:09       Can you say the sole function of pop culture is to keep people but wilderness and distracted and intoxicated. While the political elite in conjunction with the corporate powers can saps the energy of the great and powerful people of this planet? Yes. You can, but like I do think that that's a conscious decision by the cultural elite or is that a conscious decision by the people to avoid reality itself and be distracted by Goofy television? It must've been. It must be sort of both components must be both, but like you said, implied or said even earlier, we are still evolving. Evolution is still happening. It's not over easy and like so what I feel like it's what I feel like is at what information can we impart, how can we, you know, this is extremely successful as I said before, cultural artifact. You can just keep pumping alternative ideas in people's head.

Speaker 3:          00:55:07       If people start to hear it again and again, you're being lied to about civilization. It's been brought to older. You're being lied to about the nature of consciousness. You're being lied to about your options. You know, like on a very simple level. I've had got, as you, I'm sure I've gathered quite a lot of therapy over the course of my life and as a result of their substance misuse, addictions, and then just out of ongoing bloody curiosity. And I say, the function of therapy is to increase your choices in life because none of us lives in reality. Anyone who's bloodied and the empty, we'll know we don't live in reality. We live in a narrow, tiny bandwidth of reality. So if you just live in a model of reality, not reality itself, then you should take responsibility for remodeling your reality, particularly the not bloody api in it.

Speaker 3:          00:55:45       You can change it, you can change your consciousness. And for me at the moment that means quite mundane things. It means that when I arrive here and my suitcases don't arrive, I'll have the choices of do I now become account and make people's lives fucking miserable? Or do I just accept the cases are not here. This is, this is the reality. Or when I arrive at the airport and I ain't got my green card, but I really miss the flight like all, all of these, I just thought, oh, this is happening right now. The only choice I have in that moment is the choice of whether or not to stop being a dick. And, and I tried not to now and in the past I was like, fuck you, I'm excited. It is fairly well. It's so easy to just get absorbed in it. My friend Tony Visa, this once. I know I've repeated this on the podcast before,

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       but my friend Tony v C drive from, you know Tony Vee, stand up comedian. I don't think. Boston guy, hilarious guy. He used to drive from New York to Boston all the time, like almost every day. He was constantly driving. It's a pain in the ass like two and a half hours of two and a half hours back, whatever it is. New York to Boston. And what does it thrive? No, that's a good foreign like a pussy, Schatz. Michael, you had a lot of PBA cars are saying it's not that far for fucking hours. What are you talking about? I would say three at the most. Anyway, he drove, he drove it all the time and, and he was talking about what he did was he just went and zen and he said, this is what I'm doing now. The way he dealt with it. He's like, now I'm driving like there's no, there's no upset is known. This is what I'm doing, I'm doing this and if the cars are all stopped and we're all going five miles an hour, this is what we're doing.

Speaker 3:          00:57:12       Yes, that's perfect. That is literally then isn't it? That this is not to resist your reality and I don't think that means becoming some doormat that people can walk all over, but when you are in a traffic jam is the perfect example of a situation over which you have no control in this moment. You get an angry cannot influence or determine that situation in any way and then I think that if you can, once you've realized it on a mundane level of traffic jam our far, can you extrapolate that? You know when someone goes, I'm in love with someone else, I'm leaving you. Oh, okay. How long have you speak to that tolle? Do you know that guy got tall, we wrote know he speaks like this. Here's a German person Auntie so relaxed. He can barely talk to some mistakes, some glitch in the matrix. I managed to get his phone number right. Oh Geez.

Speaker 3:          00:58:02       I have to ask you to stop calling me. I'm changing my now, but it was meant to be for one interview, but then I thought, fuck me, I've got access to this Buddhist guy. I'm going to tap. It pisses me off. I call it go, what do I know? You're lucky. I've started to lot, but beyond that there's nothing that can be done for you. It was really. It was fascinating. Told you because I was like, I was having a hard time with a woman that was seen and am I going to do and she's done listening. She's done that and he goes, world, perhaps you would resolve this conflict and you will become married and you will have children and then both of you will die. She was just like, you're just like. Because he knows that actually you are. You're gonna die. That's the end point really. So like an hour over wherever you invest your energy, be fully well aware that at some point is going to be really good.

Speaker 2:          00:58:56       Yeah, it might work out or death, but definitely death. Death. How many hours does it take to get to Boston? A up three hours, 40 minutes or so. So we're in the middle. We're in the middle. It depends where you lead from the middle and if you don't drive like my mother and father would make me aware that we're going to be dead. How'd you man? And my mom. My mom would always say, I'm going to be dead one day, so you need to this, this, this and that. And it would, it would.

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       I couldn't handle that. She made, I want to say I was still alive

Speaker 3:          00:59:26       five to seven, you know, five years old. She introduced Jim to the concept of mortality, five to seven. I was still struggling with a goldfish concept that goldfish gone, oh, don't worry.

Speaker 4:          00:59:39       Isn't that a good idea? To start those thoughts off? Really, let's accept this and get over these goddamn things. Let's figure out what the fuck. We're so terrified above that we have to create a land in the clouds that were definitely all going to go to a meet up after the fucking show, but that, that, that put me in check of the whole thing, get it. I got to say, and it, it, it made me sob. Just the thought of where we going, where are we going? What happens is just are we just, is it just blackness like gluten and my and my father towards the end, he just. Lily went, yeah. He said your dad and that's. I said, show goes on and it's simple as that. Evelyn. Oh my God, I forgot about that past

Speaker 3:          01:00:16       blake. I'm not down with that one. I mean like listen, the cloud kingdom. But the thing is Joe, you know, before we moved to Oakland about your dmt experiences in new said, it will be like a sort of a cave man with a cran trying to draw, draw God right now, even on campus or maybe very specifically said it. You can rewind the podcast. You can listen to it again. That's what Joe said, right? I think you said your fingers were stubby. I don't want to be in that particular. Right, so like it when people talk about, you know, when like, like you know, the Kingdom of Heaven is within or you know, in the afterlife there'll be 72 virgins. Me Personally, I see these things, his metaphors. It will be as if you will be in such a blissful state when you are free of the shackles of the material realm when you are liberated from your body.

Speaker 3:          01:00:59       I spent, oh, how's this is this isn't nothing sort of makes me look good and maybe it makes me look sandwich. I was doing one of my base of altruism. Never Day, you know, like our doll out. Bits of altruism. I told you I already mentioned going to a homeless place today if you're picking it up. I'm a pretty nice guy. I was at this other place that was a like a adult learning difficulties place. Right? And for me the term learning difficulties was polite because these people were like, you know, fucking seriously mentally ill. I mean, I'm like, you know what I mean? That was beautiful human beings and everything, but like, well anyway, there was not. I had a really fantastic time there and of course it made me feel incredibly grateful for my own life and all the things one would imagine that you'd feel in such a situation most and now chatting to the people and one person was like, people get very certificates for various kinds of achievements, whether it was in the art art doing some joins or whether it was doing some cooking or whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:01:47       And like I started to feel the impulse of sort of a bit of patronizing this of like, oh, okay, and that certificate. Oh yeah. And then I for a minute, this ain't no fucking different from someone who's doing a full year. I in religion, in global politics really. I mean, if you can imagine supreme consciousness, if you could imagine the realms experienced on dmt or the realms that have been described with people that have dedicated themselves to meditation or Kundalini of Datasat, cade themselves. But you know, Terence Mckenna get into them, super states of consciousness accessible to individuals and our birth right. Some people say that our little achievements have I got myself a Giraffe, for example, a new car or the things that I'm proud of today. We similarly over on this little pedestrian level in a lot with sweet little darling things. Really with our material achievements, with our accolades and awards and it, it changed my perspective of it, of like bloody hell. The difference between me and someone that's not in the. What would you consider being the normal Straw of the mental health field? It's no real. It's not that bloody different. Not In infinite space. Not with Jupiter sucking in meet yours. Oh, that shit going on right now. What's the difference between me and someone that's, you know, life is confined to sort of cooking projects. It's not hugely significant except I'm not that good at cooking in a way there, but I never got asked.

Speaker 2:          01:03:01       Well, it might not be hugely significant in your perspective when you look at the infinite, but it's very significant in terms of the two of you are relating to each other and trying to work this life out and trying to be sort of a compatible try to communicate, try to be friendly with each other and work out all the weird cultural differences between everybody and try to get to the essence of what it means to be a person and we're all going through some weird sort of struggle. No one escapes the struggle. Not even Johnny Depp. Not even Johnny Depp. Even jade time, believe in Johnny. Johnny Depp got dragged into the Golden Triangle of pussy problems and he's in there right now. Oh really? Oh yeah. You didn't care. He did the rock star. Did this happen during the rock store? Didn't you hear this recently? He's getting. His girlfriend said he beat her and he's saying he's saying his girlfriend, his fucking Doug standups getting sued because he wrote a whole article saying that he's really good friends with Johnny Depp and Doug Stanhope wrote an article about how the woman is a been blackmailing johnny and threatening him and he brought it up before the.

Speaker 2:          01:03:59       The whole thing came out in the news that she had certain demands. If you didn't reach UNOS, who's fucking right and who's wrong? Correct. But at the end of the day, you know, whether Johnny telling them the truth or not, but at the end of the day, even Johnny Depp can escape to fucking pussy problems. The reality of the world, you know, he's boring. I said he's, I think for the first time in life he said he would, you would see him with images of rockstars and he loved. But now he's touring. So he's doing what? Cooper and a. But yes, he went on a rock tour. It's like I'm telling you, it's cooper selling hot dogs in Arizona. Not Dude, I'm telling you, look it up there. But they were like, cause I get a name. They stood a rock tour and I went, Huh? Johnny Depp it. And they did a lot of cities and maybe he's.

Speaker 2:          01:04:43       Wow. That's the one thing he didn't get out of a system. I don't even think that's it, man. I just think Johnny Depp is just being Johnny Depp 70. Good God damn time. But like this all the time. What's it called? The Hollywood vampires. Vampires. Johnny Depp is the guitarist. Wow. That's pretty bad ass. That's Johnny Depp over there on the far right. With a goofy hat or is it a if I left with a goofy hat? Yeah. Wow. Good for him. Johnny Depp's live in a goddamn exemplary life. And I think that's Joe Perry on the right. That is Alice motherfucking cooper. Look at that at all.

Speaker 2:          01:05:22       He's been selling hot dogs and fucking Arizona has some cooper dog or alice has dogs place. He was a radio DJ in Phoenix too. He had a radio show. He's addicted. He got to see. He goes to movies and he only sees those. He only sees the premieres and then he goes on the street. People like this is the first time he sort of like hundreds of death. It was a big difference between. Oh, so you're trying to say that he isn't doing shows is this brought him to a high heat and he pried it? No, he's probably having a ball, but I'm not saying that this happened, but maybe it could be that simple. He, that's Ah, that's a big high boy. I just stood on the stage. You'd go nuts. I was like, the only time that you're allowed to dress like that. You can't dress like that. And really you have to go on stage to dress up like that. Go, go to those, some of those photos. If you come over my house with the fucking leather pants on and a shirt like that, I'll fucking choke. You can't come in my house like that. What are you doing man? Why are you dressing like you just came over on a boat from Spain?

Speaker 2:          01:06:32       Some Cell Toro risks being taken that he's got laser on his wrists, but you can pull that off if you're in a band. Look at him, but he always dresses like that. It's like he's wearing his regular clothes. Like for Johnny Depp. He's wearing regular clothes, but he does have his sleeves rolled up and see what I mean. Sort of expectation for sure. He's definitely working on that image. Do you think he must've hair up on purpose? Like not Masiya enough. Come on, sit up a little more. Spray. Listen there, stick it up. Hey listen. I know more power to them. I want to do that too. Just wanting to go to Germany just like Ryan Paik I think can just go to Germany. You'd probably just. I could just do that too. Yeah. There is no one wants to stage and entering gentlemen. Him value freight to go it tied in lace if you choose that you would looking at in, in his.

Speaker 2:          01:07:24       His situation is whether he's navigating it successfully or not. He's definitely in a strange path of the river. You know, he's in a strange, really deep wide channel. Would incredible rapids and he's riding on a fucking inner tube down the stretch of river that nobody gets to ride. The Johnny Depp stretches like Tom Cruise stretch or the Samuel Jackson stretch. Like, whoa. Like these motherfuckers can't go anywhere. Like, yeah, Stan Hope told me. Hangs around with Johnny Depp and they can't go anywhere. They have dudes with earpieces everywhere. There's people constantly circling him, making sure he's okay and he'll go into a restaurant. There's people that are guarding the doors. They're watching the. They're making sure people don't go in the room. It's very, very different than even regular fame. He's in that pirates of the Caribbean fame where it's just can't go anywhere. That's an expensive product, bro. I need to protect that product. Well, it's also, he's super vulnerable, like people lose their fucking minds and they're around a certain level of celebrity. Does it? Tom Cruise, Tom Cruise can't go to the movies. He's get it. If you went to the movies, he would leave the movie theater and people will be trying to grab him as he was walking in the theater just to touch him and take pictures with them and it's not like you can't just interact with people, right.

Speaker 3:          01:08:36       Identify only Tom Cruise. It's an intense experience. What was that like? What'd you do? It was a film called rock of ages that Baldwin, lots of freely, freely famous people were in it and the monkey and the monkey when already where there was no monkey in it and at some point Tom Cruise said there's going to be a monkey in his film, and from that point there was a fucking monkey in the film. Even Mass Ada monkey was in scenes that Tom cruise weren't in one with me and the monkey was an asshole. It was wearing a nappy that was tied on with electric tape. It was very aggressive. It jumped off of the shoulder. The guy that was meant to be looking after the monkey, the monkey had a trailer with five other monkeys in it. It could fuck in its time off was getting the monkeys fucking contract.

Speaker 3:          01:09:22       He wouldn't have to him. You can say there's a scene with the monkey. I didn't know acting at. All I'm doing is he's just a man nervously looking at. I'm just thinking that thing down off that shoulder at any point now. Fuck you up. It could fuck. Well Thomas Tom Cruise. He likes traveling king, you know, like he's got many, many trailers like and like so like you know you arrive in a situation you think rock era. My prejudices about Tom Cruise, all the things I've read, all the things I've heard go prejudice. Like we meet him, he blasted me. We've searched affability and charm that they melt it away. Ice cones. Then the pure hate of the man. Sweetness. You gave a lock on the sofa. It was my birthday. During that film I got a big basket full of black yoga related things and stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          01:10:05       They sort of fought for president. You remember? You know, shake your hand. Remembers your name, sort of remembers details about eggs. I could brief. You mentioned you're on a or something into compensation. Next conversation. You mentioned that on A. I went round. His house for dinner was really, really late because of that fucking monkey. Actually it was playing up. A lucky was not working that day. I went back, went mandy's affidavit, said when he'd been married, Katie Holmes, and there's that little famous Tom Cruise. Siri Cruz was. They're all lined up. I went there. I was very, very late and they'd like the Ada wheat and he goes, oh, well do you want to still eat? I went, yeah, yeah, no, I wait and I had to sat like I'm sitting with you now. Joe Opposite Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes and the little dial in one. I was fucking in spaghetti like and it's as a complicated thing to eat long, isn't it?

Speaker 3:          01:10:50       I was telling me that a lady and the tramp shoving that shit in and then the next course I think was the signer, which was weird because that's to pass the courses. Then I think there was like sort of cupcakes and stuff involved all the way through. It just sat opposite. Tom Cruise silicon about communism, which I brought up as a topic, which in retrospect was a mistake. Why? Well, because don't bring up communism because I like what I said was our goes, well, I'm down with fairness where I goes, you know, communism. Yeah. Surely it went a bit. It got a bit out of control. No one's arguing with that. Went a bit hectic. I'm not down with massacres. Genocides under one flag, but fairness and justice I'm fully up for. And Tom Cruise goes out. Data about that. The communism. Marco's. Yeah. But Tom, you were born with this thing.

Speaker 3:          01:11:31       You've been born with this thing. I guess that's like being born an Irish. The crap, you know, like the thing that you've got that drive or wherever, you know, your, like people aren't like you. I try to explain it to Tom, but uh, it was hard for him to take me seriously. Speaker eight, amateur. But I had a good go of saying it's probably different to be Tom cruise than other people. Yeah, for sure. But what, what, what was he saying? That the communism is a bad idea. And you were saying that, you know, maybe sharing more would be a good idea. Isn't it weird that communism is connected to dictatorships, which is kind of the opposite of communism. It really is. I think if anything, as soon as people start to implement ideas, it gets in fucking trouble, doesn't it? Because people started. People put Lauer.

Speaker 3:          01:12:11       Nicole. Yeah, the power of course. Because all of these political ideas and religious art is exposed to just be, we're here, we're going to die, or should we try and make it as nice as possible? And like part of that is going to be not been out of order to each other and like in a sort of like and buy all of them interface with our problems, the problems. We have described those biological mechanical drive. So I'm trying out a lot. All I said is like the communism there is socialism and communism and communism. That's different from the depiction of communism that a lot of Americans and English people would have because we were. We were on the other side of the Cold War. So we got a very, very negative impact. And of course that was a version of communism. It was pretty fucking brutal in places as is capitalism, you know.

Speaker 3:          01:12:51       So I'm sort of like trying to kick around these. I was saying like, yeah, but really all communism is, is a sort of a version of Christianity in that it's saying we are all brothers here and all of us have riots and we should be trying to build a society where we love each other. That's sort of what he's saying, you know, like, you know, where it goes wrong is it doesn't allow room for individualism and the many myriad distinctions between different human beings by one concentrate on that, but that's not really communism or that it's really more of dictatorships. That was dictatorship. So you can dress it up. It won't because like, yeah, that's the. Yeah. Um, I mean like, you know, I'm not a scholar in communism, otherwise I'm going to do a degree in religion and global politics. And for me, I'm going to spend the next three years doing it.

Speaker 3:          01:13:27       Part time you, you have to pop in a day and that week. And actually have not done it yet. Go go for the interview next week. I'm hoping they're going to let me in. Just on the basis of. C'Mon. Let me in the fucking Tele. Give us a break. Anyway, so I'm there anyway, but my point, my point I was trying to make is that things get convoluted and complicated by, you know, bureaucracy, ideology and demagoguery. But ultimately we're just meant to be sharing and sort as bloody community. Really. The dictatorship aspect of it is almost like, it's almost like that same inescapable drive that causes someone to want to be the monkey with the five monkeys did a good fucking time. There's only so long going, I'm going to be the monkey. That's fucking fine. Wherever it's like any sort of religious extremism, there's always some guy at the end of it go and I'm going to

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       be fucking five monkeys in my trailer and then that person's ruining it for the rest of us. Because like whenever you see like about religious coal in it, you know, I've started a religious cult, you know, we all live here together and we grow around vegetables. Everything's organic. Yeah. Alright. That's lovely mate. Oh, you fucking everyone. Oh, I done against that a little bit. Yeah, a little bit. I've got a monkey trailer. Everybody else's wives. Yeah. That's. That's one of those weird, inescapable things about being a person who did these. These drives that you have to figure out how to hold them together. I think communism would work. Look, if this was a community, if we, if we were the only four people on an island, just us four, we would be communists. We would all just get together and we would talk like, how do you guys want to handle this?

Speaker 1:          01:14:54       Like what do we do? How do we gather this? I'm pulling off. Yeah. Hey, I'm, I'm pretty good at climbing trees under where the coconuts are. Okay, cool. And we'd figure it out. Share poems cause only provide those, but we will lose our share. Right? And if we didn't, we'd have to have a conversation. We'd have to say, hey joe, you're not fucking digging enough holes or you don't catch enough fish. We gotta we gotta work this out together. So we all contributed in equal amount. You can't be lazy and exist off the fruits of your brothers and sisters. Labor. It's really good. It's all contribute. What's difference between that and being tribal? It's the same thing. Same thing. Have you heard this thing? The inner chimpanzee societies, they have about 75 chimps. Ryan, once it gets to about eight or nine a things get edgy and they normally break off and go a breakaway chimp community because this is getting too heavy over here and so the assumption is that we, as you know, great apes ourselves similarly should be living in manageable communities.

Speaker 1:          01:15:50       We serve over stimulate new exposure. You know, when you were sort of joking about like the power of women and femininity, you're not meant to be exposed to that kind of stuff. You're not meant to meet that exposed to that kind of imagery that is present in pornography. You don't mean to be exposed to that kind of that kind of variety. Women to be like, there's 50 or 60 of us. Alright, these people, good warriors. These people are good fishermen. These people look at it. I mean mysticism, you know, you find little roles in it, but again, since we've lived in this mono culture where people are like little cells, batteries, all sort of stacked up together in cities and suburbs. Then like how do you access that we're not having an authentic human experience, so that's why there's so much. So what do I want to say?

Speaker 1:          01:16:30       Disease, what's an authentic human experience, but it's a very new one. It's a very different thing and I've, I've tried to figure out what it is we're actually doing, but it seems to me that everything is getting more and more connected. Right? So what we're doing when these cities is we're connecting 20 million people into this massive buildings and then we're connecting them all with the Internet. So they weren't connecting those 20 million people with 10 million people in this state and 5 million people in that state. And we're, we're all becoming one sort of weird gigantic group that's very, very dissimilar from the original tribal groups that allowed one alpha male to run things. One Alpha female community. Everybody knowing and understanding each other. And when you, when you talk like archeologists

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       and have you ever read sex at dawn? Dr Chris Ryan, really interesting book, but what he maintains is that this idea, even of monogamy that didn't exist in these tribal cultures, they shared sexuality like everybody's swapped around and people banged everybody and that's one of the reasons why they stayed intimate is that they all probably were polyamorous, polyamorous, and they didn't understand they will steal. It speaks to our nature because we don't want to be monogamous. It's a struggle. But the polyamorous thing also speaks to this idea that before we understood genetics and we understood DNA, we didn't know whose children they were. So if you had a child, if a woman had a child and I fucked her and you fucked her and you fucked her, we'll assume it's our kid. We don't. No one knows. They didn't understand it. They didn't know once. It will mail and clues along the way. For sure. Definitely people get it. They figured it out after a while that kids struggling a little paypal.

Speaker 2:          01:18:05       But that's a weird thing too, is how children maintain some sort of talent traits that their parents have. Like there's things that get passed on through children to, through DNA of obsessive behaviors come like a desire to grow and learn. People like have kids that are very similar in personality that seemed to be like inherent to the child that seems to come through the DNA. If it wouldn't, wouldn't that be a little bit to have the kid that's only knows growing up and he's, if he's watching maybe a parent that's obsessive, he's either going to not be in that or I'm going to be. I'm sure it's possible. It's totally possible. But there's also like a pattern that they follow. Like um, my middle daughter is obsessed with things. She gets obsessed with things. Like she's read six Harry Potter books. She's eight. She's keeps reading them.

Speaker 2:          01:18:52       She'll read hours and hours every night. And then she also wants to talk about Harry Potter. She's all fucking totally. Harry Potter it out. Like all day long she will explain something, man. I'm like, is that Harry Potter thing? She was like, yes it is. And then she'll, she'll, she's just obsessed with Harry Potter or gymnastics or whatever the fuck it is. She's very much like me. When she gets something, she just doing cartwheels in the living room all day long and fucking backhand springs. She never stops. She's just obsessed and she gets on these things and just ride them out and she doesn't even necessarily know that that's how I am. I don't think she sees that because I'm not like that when I'm around her. Really. So you observing her and it's the same extent. Oh Wow. She's got my eyes. You can see she's exhibiting traits. She's not been taught.

Speaker 2:          01:19:33       They're very extreme. It's very extreme. It's not like a, Oh, it's similar because my youngest daughter is just silly. She's not like that at all. She's, she's not obsessive at all. She just a fun little kid. But the middle one is kind of fucking crazy. Does that. How does that, does that make you feel like different type of connection? No, no, no, no, no, no. This is the connection with all of them. That's interesting thing about having children. The connection with all of them is just so spectacular. It's not a, there's not like I connect with this one more than that one, connect with all of them. But um, it's interesting to observe your own bizarre personality traits manifesting themselves almost in a genetic level. Kid. Yeah. I, I, uh, my middle one's like that. My middle one is identical twin. Me and I sometimes I like it.

Speaker 2:          01:20:22       Sometimes I love it and sometimes they go, oh, I like that. How old is she? She's 14. So she's really blossoming. But you know what? The one that does all the gymnastics and all that. I noticed too with kids, they express happiness in different ways. My oldest one, the only time I know she's truly happy and she's 17 now, is when she's bouncing, singing, doing a cartwheel outside. She kind of instrument. That's when she's silent. I go, Oh man, something's up. This kid's been silenced or turned dad. So expressive. You know, also when you think about it, like who, who's like more expressive than you, like you're this like joyful guy who was always get this crazy laugh and you know, by now at 14, she's super aware that you play these places all over the world. People come to see you and laugh. I mean, that's got to be bizarre to what does it mean?

Speaker 2:          01:21:10       What does your dad do for a living? Oh, I fixed the pipes. What about your dad just talks shit in front of people and they left their dick off. You know, it's a very bizarre thing for a kid to go, whoa, Whoa, whoa. You can do that too, right? You know, and they see that and then you know, and also I'm sure you're not restrictive in how they express themselves. You probably want them to have fun and laugh and joke around a lot. Yeah. I mean, so that gets encouraged and then I think happiness, like self reflection and all these other things, these, it's a, these are muscles and you can work on those muscles. You know, you can, you can develop them.

Speaker 3:          01:21:42       I think you're absolutely right about that. I, I, they, it, I've been using these circuits, leather, if you login, how it must be neurologically. Of course I'm speculating about neurology, which is probably not something that someone who knows nothing about you,

Speaker 2:          01:21:55       none of us do. So we'll just follow you on

Speaker 3:          01:21:58       the uh, the, you know, if you're continually activate in certain neurological pathways or creating relationships, synaptic relationships, then that, that's going to fire up more readily. I mean, I notice it with some of these new things I'm doing, like initially when people were explaining stuff about getting out of off guard and lighten how even to shuffle on the floor, you know, that shrimp is. I said I ain't ever going to be. I do this sooner. So flat. It seems like it's making its way behaviorally into a different aspect of my consciousness. And I suppose if there's like in a wind to happiness or misery or addiction, if you're continually living in that circuit, like, like, you know, people talk about programming I feel like, but when I'm aware of my programming, is there certain things that if people say them to me, I can't help the reaction that I have, you know, obvious ones, a citizen.

Speaker 3:          01:22:42       If I'm exposed to certain sexual images, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, I feel all those feelings before I make any decisions. If someone makes me feel insecure or say something, we'll have to really watch that moment before because otherwise before now I've gone down a path of behavior and I think that what the perhaps what we can do on an individual level is learn. And this is not hard for people are living in total fucking crisis and dreadful poverty in the. You said before, I'm personally, I'm in a privileged position where I can begin to bring my consciousness to those kinds of things, right? I want to live on that circuit. Now. I don't want to always have Nikki judgments. I, I'm always want to feel fearful when these moments, I want to learn to plow that neurological pathway so that it's easier for me to stay there, that you know programming is necessary and like if you're not living on a program that you've taken control of individually, you're living on someone else's program, you're living on that program that's out there, that constant bombardment of negativity and fear and anxiety and division and you're different from paypal and you're not good enough and by this otherwise you're not going to be good enough.

Speaker 3:          01:23:41       You know that you're going to need pretty strong defenses. I think that's why with the diminished role of religion in our life with the diminished role of sort of political ideologies that we can trust. What are people supposed to do about being alive and not feeling good or who do you go to now

Speaker 2:          01:23:58       doing it? I think you were part of it. I think there's a lot of other people that are doing it too. It's like you're trying to reexamine the patterns that you're stuck in and how many of these patterns that you or I or Jim or anybody here, it's created for themselves. You've created a lot of your own prison bars and that's a really common thing with people. You know, these whatever defenses that you've put up, whatever the patterns that you've instinctively followed because of jealousy or fear of inadequacy or any weird feelings, you've set these neurological patterns and they're very difficult to break once you've set them yourself. It's almost like you've built your own prison and now you're complaining about it.

Speaker 3:          01:24:33       Yes, I agree with this. Now that, do you think we could introduce to that, uh, kind of a compassion because, you know, when we're earlier on, we're talking about like we can understand people who sort of jealousy or irritation like people being famous or rich because I, there's no doubt there's too much inequality, this, too much injustice. It's not something that can really be questioned. And so when, what I'm trying to do is bring bloody compassion and tolerance to places where I find it odd today someone was like, you know, I told you I didn't bring no club. I left my suitcase, I fucked up, you know, so it's going in the shop and this is gonna. This is a problem of great privilege. I went along to a pretty cool shop in Los Angeles and their security fellow at goes shopping open yet. Then he recognized me and he goes, oh no, no, no, their shop is open.

Speaker 3:          01:25:16       Right? And the. And I was like, oh, thank you mate. And I felt all special for a moment. Then we got to the doorway to shop and the guy that was inside the shop, he, I don't know, he's having a bad day or whatever. And he goes, oh, you know, maybe you can't come in. Right? And I made it for you. Fucking like the reaction. I feel like rage actually. And in the security guy to his eternal credit overrode the guy in the right now. And just let him in, let him in, in Laos got in the shop. And I felt sort of like I felt better about myself in that moment. Like, I'm so special, I'm allowed. It had so many little things sort of triggered in me in that sort of short momentary interaction and feeling of like, oh great. The security guy recognizes me. Oh No, this guy, they let me in. And it's very hard for me actually. It says I'm still in my mind judging that guy that they wouldn't let me in and around in my consciousness fucking pumps. You still have an argument in your head, should say

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       that, that would have destroyed him. That guy told the perfect thing like a silver bullet and then you get there. And he goes, hey man, I'm really sorry if I was rude earlier, I just, uh, my girlfriend broke up with the perfect thing. And then you will go to support guys working retail girlfriends. Fucking some football player. Poor bastard, right? Does your mom is too? Are you going to club and you're so fucking rude. I thought in my mad success I'd reached to the point where I can walk to a place in the city. You're not allowed in here and I turn around, I'm going fucking, I'm going to buy this fucking place and then I'm going to fire. That's how fucking work. That's what Tom Cruise does. So Tom, the new place said a lot of admin just to maximize net. You've got to go for. All right. Okay. The surveyors are coming on Monday gauge, right? Jesus Christ. 50 people coming to check right now. Could you bring a. suddenly we can't bring in Dave because he's a chemotherapy session. Can we might have some weird laws or who you could fire and not foreign.

Speaker 1:          01:27:22       Imagine now you buy the building. This fuck has to keep working for you. Oh my God. Now you're stuck with him and then he sues you for discrimination or harassment or something like that. Dave was missing a tone when I tried to sack him. That was a misstep. Wasn't mistake in retrospect. So did anybody from the Tom Cruise camp try to convert? You know, one might even the remote is the effort to convert me. I couldn't have made it more clear that was desperately in need of an ideology gets funded. It was something to believe in some structure, so just for Fuck Sake, give me that dialectics book, whatever it's called. Yeah, there should be a way. Right. I was not interested. It's like Joe, I felt. I thought they felt that I would ruin so until the tree. And they did. They did. They didn't. There was no invitation, but no one said, come on mate, you need a biff l, Ron Hubbard in your life.

Speaker 1:          01:28:18       There was no, no interest. They might have been an expansionist religion. No one up at all, and if ever there was a candidate for a religion, I think they tread very carefully on those waters. You have to start asking questions yourself or there's certain levels. Perhaps this is also possibly where they don't necessarily really want anybody fucking thought, no, I didn't qualify. I'm going to that fucking slippery center. I'm going to kick the bloody door and say, come on. I think type. My mother had been burned too many times up. They're very careful about who they allow in, who they don't allow, and I would imagine that pillorying of science, I'm always feel sorry for me. Well, they're just trying their hardest to make up a religion. I mean, I don't know. I just see going clear. Yeah, that was. You'll stop feeling sorry for him.

Speaker 1:          01:29:05       When you watch going clear, you like, what in the fuck? I like that Guy Paul Haggis who went like when they showed him, right? This is your scripts. He was like, he looked around for the outcome and this is the test right to people. If you believe in this, they go, no, you fucking market. That's not the real thing. You immediate get out. Well, he was a madman. I mean l Ron Hubbard, whether or not he's correct about scientology wrote more fiction than any person that's ever lived. Even if that was his only qualification, he was just making stuff and making stuff up and then he wrote this and no red flags. No one, no one goes, hey, maybe made this up to no fucking chance. On Monday is in Guinness. World Records for making shit up on Tuesdays he starts to religion and no one goes, is this connected to Monday's activity in any way?

Speaker 1:          01:29:50       Not only that, just a chronic liar. Just his whole life was just full of shit. Oh. So I didn't like. He's rubbery wet lips like Ronald Mcdonald mouth. It was a little bit of a global sort of like sort of wet slobbery guy on those fucking cruise ships dressing people up. I mean, I'm not a big fan of dudes with captains outfits on him and what he did, he was in the navy and he did command ships apparently. But he was apparently a pretty good at that shit. He was removed from his duty. But the point is after he got out decided I'm still rocking this captain's outfit go, fuck. They will believe anything's how I crossed me. I got a boat, I'm going to make some shit up and I'll have them for quite a and make a good business of watch me areas. Yeah. I skipper madman, look it at fascinating and the liquid around the mouth, I suppose people that are scientologists was say, this is our religion and uh, you're taking the piss out of our region.

Speaker 2:          01:30:50       It's an ideology that is also a very positive one in the sense that it's dedicated towards self improvement. And eliminating all these psychological barriers that are holding you back and in that way people find a lot of benefit in being a part of that religion and I think when they find a lot of benefit and being a part of it, then you know they can justify all the other nonsense and just sort of ignore it because what l Ron Hubbard, according to the going clear book, Lawrence Krauss Book was trying to do with self medicate, would he? He had a lot of psychological issues himself and he was trying to cure his own issues and in using these methods to cure his own religion or the zone, his own issues, he translated them into a religion. Like this was a big part of what scientology initially was, was his own attempts to self diagnose and treat his own psychological ailments.

Speaker 1:          01:31:41       Quite a good idea really works really well. And there are so I suppose people there, it's working for all right. Like a quote I heard, I'd like to be quick to see where religious people are, right? You know, it's all really August where religious people are wrong because we sort of hear about it on news, but like

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       w we're religious people are right, you know, sort of togetherness, selfless nurse relationship with a deeper self acceptance of death and the possibility of transcendence of the human primal self. Those things are all really beautiful ideas that they've kind of lost their way in a science, a science, you know, that term. Scientism, the idea that sort of science has got into territories that science can really handle because we come to a judging full stop at certain points. You know, like what happened on the Tuesday before the Big Bang, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:32:27       serialism materialism, individualism

Speaker 3:          01:32:32       are hard things to overcome. If like, if, if people, if we are, if we have as our dominant mindset, I'm only gonna believe shit that I can prove. Then you are just an individual and you may as well just. Why not just spend your life fuck as many people as you can and accumulating as much material as you can because nothing exists. Unless you can see it, measure it, why it contain it and fuck it. You know, if that is the dominant belief system, which was sort of materialism, consumerism, capitalism, I think all dovetail on that premise. This is all real. That's how you can have the, the chronic ecological disrespect is because it really doesn't matter what happens after you're dead. There you go, well, what about my fucking children? Even just not a practical level of called live on this fucking pebble in infinite space.

Speaker 3:          01:33:20       But if you're just like, well, not really thought about that in a sort of an inability to accept, you know, like certain. I know that you're sort of like a wholesale by any dominant theory, but I think it's clear to me that general, well, I believe in on an individual level and on a cultural level, if something is possible, you should be trying to fucking do it. So as soon as people realize, hold on a minute, that's having a negative impact, or hey, this is a better way of using our resources. Now utilities, soon as you realize it, you should be moving towards it. They say wisdom is acting on knowledge. Once you recognize, oh, fossil fuels are running out so right fucking hell, we'd better start working on the basis that we're fucked. We better start looking at alternative energy sources. We're looking at different alliances like knowing those things and not doing them.

Speaker 3:          01:34:04       It makes me very, very uneasy because it makes me think who benefits from ignoring this stuff? Who's running this show? If he's having all of the. It's creating all this rage, all this unease, all this fear in your country and in my country now times of great, great disease and uncertainty for people really looking for something and know that these institutions are just saying, just united carry on. There's no sort of alternative. No one's going to let you know is going to see himself as part of a religious community in the same way or so. One of the dead ideologies of the last century and meanwhile we're in this sort of peculiar style of looming crisis. It feels kind of fucking mad

Speaker 2:          01:34:44       in a state of looming crisis, but to unpack this whole thing, you started off with this idea of what happened the Tuesday before the Big Bang and how science can't really answer that well, they can't answer it yet. Like the problem is once they gather data, it might be 100 years now or a thousand years from now. They can say, Oh, well here we've done the calculations and we understand now that it's an infinite cycle of birth and death and the universe is constantly expanding contracting and this is the process that we're a part of. It's infinite and it's never started. It is never ending and it goes on and on and on.

Speaker 3:          01:35:14       I think you'll probably bloody right mate. I like that idea that you just espoused is in 5,000 year old fucking document called the upanishads. Those ideas, those ideas are there already. So when we fucked off religion a hundred years ago because it was causing too much, you know our sake, we got. We kicked out of some of the ideas that are only now just being

Speaker 2:          01:35:34       discovered. Right? But those ideas are just to be contemplated right now and to be considered. Whereas science is trying to find definitive evidence that they do or don't represent the reality of our timeline. And once they do, then there'll be able to talk about it. But right now what they're doing is they're examining the evidence that the big bang exists and what could have possibly caused that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:35:54       See what, where what, what my difficulty is is that there are. That is when any ideology behaves dogmatically and prohibitively prevent, prevent further exploration, like whatever that would like. What kind of. What's an example of it? The nature of consciousness. No one knows why consciousness impact matter in the way it does in the sub quantum world. Now we can't fucking. We've come to a point where it's like, oh fuck. Like you know, like if you were like that, the, the famous double Slit Theory and observed particle behaves differently like the end of the park. One way you can change it. It's the central nature depending on where he's been obsessed

Speaker 2:          01:36:32       presented though when it's been explained to me by people actually understand it. What it really is is that we're measuring these particles and in the act of measuring, you're changing the results because you're using something to measure it. Yes, yes, but it gets represented as all this woo woo craziness,

Speaker 3:          01:36:52       but what? What I think is interesting, Joe, is somewhere between this woo craziness and they're kind of a flat, mundane, low. This is life. You're born, you die, you eat food. Shit comes out your ass old territory, somewhere in there is a mystery that they're behind your eyes buying Jimbo, Jamie's eyes and my eyes. There is a constant. There is this consciousness, there is this awareness. There's this inexplicably experience that you've add on dmt experiences that I've had through yoga and through lsd. That suggests to me that consciousness itself is the dominant force. Consciousness is not just one more phenomena is the seat of all phenomena and when people are saying, oh, there's this thing, that's God. What they are saying is there is an absolute consciousness and all is contained within it all matter at some point has come from consciousness. These realms, they're experienced true psychedelic or extreme extreme, you know, personal experiments like if cryogenic things or your flotation tanks all suggest a phenomenon beyond the individual consciousness.

Speaker 3:          01:37:54       They something else say and the very fact that you know that it's in for the consciousness, even by the process of measuring, even by the process of measuring is influencing and impacting rally. I don't think that, you know, I'm not taking that to the extreme. I know what you mean. Make some people go, oh, that means your mind can control shit. And when I think it means that, it means that reality is only reality. When you look at it, that's what it's kind of getting towards a bloody good book. I reckon your listeners will be banging into his Kumbaya centuries in by a man called Robert Lanza who he did the best breakdown I've ever read of that double slit experiment and, and have the, the, the, the, you know, made me understand for the first time that reality is happening within your own consciousness. It's not an external phenomena at all that you know, like he explained it very wisely.

Speaker 3:          01:38:39       I could understand of like, he went, you know, you sort of think I'm totally mundane. He went like, you know the experience of going in your kitchen in the nine, turning the light on. Is your kitchen fridge still there when you go back downstairs? He goes, well I guess when you do go into your kitchen and turn the light on, he goes to your Foa on parcels of photons. Come down, I'd interact with the optic nerve. They have a trans law. They invert it in your consciousness that you know, so whatever it is, what's in your kitchen when you're not looking at it, it ain't the same as when you are looking at is an interpretive reality. And one of the ways that I've sort of reduced this down for my own simple understanding is this, that if none of us had a sense of smell, if you didn't, I'd been Jamie didn't.

Speaker 3:          01:39:17       And then how would the concept of smell makes sense? How would you go out with a pint and this bike and with none of us would have the instrument to receive it. So that whole thing will be off the agenda. So I think that there are streams of energy streams of data for which we do not have the instruments to receive, so we totally discount it because we simply don't have the instruments to receive it. And I said once in my standup, as a matter of fact, like my cat doesn't know there's an internet, the internet does not enter the realm of my cats consciousness, but the fucking internet is out there. We're out here. Having with these fucking experiences and like all those realms that we're experiencing in these various sort of psychedelic states or however they achieved is an indication to me there's another reality now.

Speaker 3:          01:39:56       Where does that become fucking relevant to what we're talking about? For me, where it does, he's one of the continual ideas that keeps reemerging to connect us back to where we were with Joe Campbell at the beginning is there is this fucking sense of oneness and believing ourselves to be individual and believing that the dominant thing in our lives to be material that fucks us up because people will kill each other over that material and once we realized no with the true thing about us is the consciousness is the inner self. That's the roofing they we're all out here. We're all in the game. We're going to do shit and we're all gonna make mistakes, but that's not have the material idea as the dominant social idea because everyone's agreed with that. Whether they're communist or capitalist of fascist, wherever everyone's saying now the main thing is they ship this out here and it's like that connects to those primal drives because we know that if that's happening to your sexual drive, you can never have enough pussy.

Speaker 3:          01:40:44       If that gets into your state test drive, you can never have enough status and power, you know, so like we're all going to still feel those things. I'm still going to be a camp 25 times a day, but it'd be nice if the cultural ambiance was, oh, I don't know who, Russell, you'll be back to your normal self in a minute of feeling that we're all one and we're all connected. Not, yeah, well of course I'd feel right that you know, like that. And that's what frightens me about the culture of our countries at the moment is it's endorsing the worst aspects of our nature. It's acculturating the worst aspects of our nature instead of the best aspects of our nature and that for me then I'm fucking difference between left and right in the current political sphere because they're all making the same argument. They're all saying come and live out here in the material world.

Speaker 2:          01:41:25       Yeah. It seems to me that the material world and this idea that we should be accumulating possessions and status and all these different things is universal. It almost seems like it's a natural progression from ancient tribal civilization life to this weird city life, to this integration of electronics and our life in this symbiotic relationship that we have two computers and the Internet and information itself. It seems like this is one of the things that drives. That is this desire for material possessions. Because when you have a desire for material possessions and ensures that you're going to continue to innovate and come up with newer and greater and better because you always want to keep up with the Joneses. You always want to have the newest tesla because it goes zero to 60 in two seconds and you want to have the coolest fucking house with the biggest TV and the fastest internet and all those things sort of compound this technological innovation cycle that we're on.

Speaker 2:          01:42:14       So my thought has been for a long time that what we are is some sort of electronic caterpillar that's going to give birth some artificial life and that all of our desire for material possessions and status and all these different things is really just us pushing forth this electronic agenda and that this innovation and the construction of artificial intelligence that's inevitable is eventually going to be the next stage of life and that weird like huddling ourselves up in this sort of civilization cocoon and that boom out of that cocoon is gonna pop. Some sort of a god being and that this is what we're here for and this is what we've been doing since we're monkeys flinging shit at each other and flipping over cow patties, looking for mushrooms. That we are a part of a process. And then if you look at it objectively, all these traps that you or I or Tom Cruise or Jim breuer been caught up in when whether it's traps of Eagle or jealousy.

Speaker 2:          01:43:06       All these things sort of ensure movement. They insure movement, ensure interactivity, and that is going to ensure innovation and progress and competition. And all those things that even we look at it, we go, this is so pointless, this is so foolish. So but yet it's so incredibly prevalent. Not Glorifying it or saying it's definitely the way to go, but objective Lee, if you weren't a human and you're stepping outside of this thing, looking at it from a distance, you're like, these fuckers are making something they might not even know they're making something, but they're making. I understand

Speaker 3:          01:43:35       that the same way that bees or ants may will be aware of their hive consciousness and the and the common drive. But where I disagree with you, Joe, is that you see the end point as being the materialization of a super consciousness through technology. I see the end point is being a realization amongst us as a species. Now I know that they're both could be both and there is no. There isn't a reason to, you know, we all just another fucking, oh we just another species on this planet. Oh, we will know better than dogs and cows and monkeys. I don't, I, I, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:44:07       we are. If the sun that heats us up as a lifespan, where are their inventions as well? The cats and the monkeys. That's I'm fucking invented being cute. I mean they're so real dollar in your lap. You pet them. They like it. They need to contribute. They're contributing. Take the dog for a walk. You come up with ideas. You're not spelling. I'll do love my dog,

Speaker 3:          01:44:31       but hold on. But my. What was my. What was my point in that?

Speaker 2:          01:44:35       Well, I think you want to pump the brakes. What you're saying is we should pump the brakes. We should pump the brakes of this possession in this. This idea that we're trying to accomplish these great things by accumulating things and status and it's all bullshit and it's really about consciousness more than anything.

Speaker 3:          01:44:50       In fact, Bill Hicks, I think already said it when he said that, you know, that we can be explored. We can explore space in an hour together in peace. That that idea that if we look to our common drives, it's like ended up at Hancock all the time. I've heard him on your show saying like that. Know what really what's happened is a bias towards a particular aspect of our own consciousness, the problem solving brain and let you know that those drives are amazing. Those drugs they're trying to get somewhere. Technology is amazing. We would like you to at the very fact that people in bloody here is, I don't understand any event. It's fucking wonderful, but the dominant idea behind it, one of profit that dominating idea and the profit in itself is not necessarily negative but profit at all cost, profit at any cost. So really I'm not saying we should as a species fucking slow down and dressing fell and fucking, you know, like grab and vegetables. It's funny now I want human beings to be glorious, but what I'm saying is that our bias towards this one particular item, materialistic idea, is preventing us from realizing that glory because part of our consciousness has been ignored.

Speaker 4:          01:45:50       Yes, but you from the time you want to say yes, but no, no, no, I think we all agree on that and I hate to dumb it. I'm dumb. So dumb it down and I go back to pink floyd. We don't need no education. It all we all aware you don't have a chance where you check your back is against the wall from the time you come out of the womb because you're saturated with false images. You're saturated in our society. God is money and success and there is no soul. They're in a too. It takes people like you and I to go there and go, there's nothing doesn't fucking matter because it's so oversaturated. That's why the Kardashians are huge and this person's huge and because it's almost laughable because the more you put it out there, the harder they have to hit them on their cell phones. Well, here's phones. The kids

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       are going to be on a 24 slash seven. It just, it's massive overload. It's the more your brain goes this way, the more they go, well, we're not designed for this amount of information coming in and that's for sure. Now we're not designed to be connected with 7 billion people all over the world. We're not designed to seeing a camera placed on someone that doesn't have anything good to say. Interesting. Said, oh, but they're constantly on camera and they're editing it in a way that you're short attention span is sort of connected to this thing because every 15 seconds of given you a new camera angle, and that's by design. It's like an interface. They figured out how to do these reality shows where they edit the show, so like a music video where you're constantly changing the angle so you're constantly stimulated. If you just had Kim Kardashians sitting across the table from her mom and they were just sitting there for like three hours talking like a podcast, you would want a fucking mediator to come from Jupiter and slam right into that God damn house and this now stop this before it spreads.

Speaker 2:          01:47:49       What are they doing? But if you keep them going back and forth and then you cut to a single of them by themselves. Bitching about, my mom has always been about blah, blah, blah, and then go back to her. Well, she thinks that she can do this, and then what am I shooting was, wow, look at that. Watch premier cameras and constant changing of angles and it's constant fucking introducing of a new thing to pay attention to. I'm sorry, on a stupid small note on a tiny, tiny note of how powerful and how far my oldest daughter and I, I hate to admit it, she sat there and her lips. She came in the room and I told it 20 times, don't do that. She saw something on the Internet, sticking her lips in the bottle and it blows her lips up and for three days and everyone's doing it and who wasn't? That was mad at her. I went, wow, this is how many my kids part of that banana land. It's just, it's almost like they're laughing at us now. We couldn't make them do.

Speaker 2:          01:48:48       No one's pulling those strings. We're pulling strings. It's a visual. Oh, I see it and that's what I want to be. Right? Look at that image. I know how many women want them in like that shot into the Ras, so they look like Kim Kardashian. There's like a whole trend where women are waist training where they're wearing these corsets and tightening down there fucking organs and then they're having fat shoved into their ass. They're extracting fat from areas of their body and then reintroducing it into their ass in order to develop this round ridiculous thing that looks like you're wearing a fucking diaper to be relevant in to, to imitate the same way. You know, the Siri women have fucking plates in their lips were imitating patterns that we see. They don't necessarily have to make sense, but we're this weird animal that's sort of imitates what our surroundings are.

Speaker 2:          01:49:41       We imitate our atmosphere and some strange way and we can. We can sort of create our own hell that we, you know, we reproduce this thing around us that's not just unsuccessful. It's so unsatisfying. It's weird. It's depressing and we do the Goddamn same thing. We've become too good adaptations of mutate state and that's what was trying to say earlier with the. They influences the paradigm, the template that we're moving towards these two predicated on the material to the point where yeah, it's ludicrous. Things I think like you joined the comparison between the neck things and hearing things in the condition that that power that we're harnessing all seems to center around innovation when we're pursuing material possessions, when we're pursuing physical items, we're not talking about like vintage things like I'm really into handmade things. I love a handmade bag or handmade knife. I love the idea that someone created something, crafted something, but those things are the same.

Speaker 2:          01:50:38       Like if you buy a knife that some guy made hammering in a, you know, one of those vats of fucking fire and Bang, Bang, Bang, you're dead. He's doing it the same way. People have done it for hundreds if not thousands of years. There's something fascinating about that and interesting about that, but in terms of like progression and innovation, it's like you can't compete with these God damn laptops or phones or any of these things. Those things are, they're getting better and better at this staggering exponential rate and at the end of that line, see this. If you've, if you extrapolate, if you look at it from a distance, you pull yourself away from culture and civilization and look down what is this super being called, the human race? What is the super organism doing, which creating better and better things? Well, why is it doing that? Why is it ignoring the very ocean that surrounds it?

Speaker 2:          01:51:25       Why is it sucking all the fish out of the ocean and shitting all the fucking dirt and dust up into the air, but ignoring that while concentrating on the possession and the innovation of all these electronic gadgets? Well, it's got to be something to do with that. It's like a pole and Mckenna used to call it an attractor that we're being pulled towards some future attract or some singularity event. Some moment that we are creating, whether we're aware of it or not, but that part of all of our ridiculous behavior in terms of our ego and our drive for success and attention and love and affection, all of these different things is really sort of pushing this innovation further and further and quicker and quicker and it's extremely interesting idea what it feels thinking when you're saying that. It's like, oh, every time that's happening, the creativity you'll put where all of these things before the exact same things exist in this unrealized realm, will play over, refer to as the realm of ideas that there's an idealized form of all things before they are realized in the material world. Like someone designing a knife has to consciously conceive of the knife before bringing it into the material world. That there's this constant need to pull from this unrealized like whenever I see babies now, I wanted to get him. Where were you? What was your countries? That's telling me what it's like to hopefully still am

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       friendly with David Lynch, the film maker, and he told me that a friend of his over were outside their kids' nursery and they had a three year old kid in a six month year old, can't don't say years after my six month old kid and they heard the free route go. The six month kid, I need you to tell me about heaven again because I'm beginning to forget David Lynch. I blew my mind. Where is consciousness before I forget. Oh,

Speaker 2:          01:53:14       as a person, and Jim, you can back me up on this. As a person who has kids, one of the most bizarre aspects of child raising is that when you have them in their babies, these moments when they're little and tiny, you think, I will never gonna forget this. This is the most powerful moment of my life. This is amazing. Being around them when they're so little and their first words, they're talking to you, but you fucking forget it. You forget it all because you know them as the them. They are now at six or at eight or at 10 or at 14, and those incredibly powerful moment you forget, but meanwhile you're. You remember some cut you off in traffic 14 years ago and you're like, I should have kicked out fucking guys as I saw him at the red light and I didn't get out of my car and it haunts me to this day on a drag him out of his car and feed him his fucking teeth.

Speaker 2:          01:53:59       You remember that, but you won't remember your daughter being to dancing to some music that's on television and everybody laughing and cheering along. You have to see it. You have to look at a fucking video that you saved on your iphone and watch it and you go, oh yeah, that's right. Oh my God, what an amazing moment. Somehow or another almost like dreams, those ideas are erased from the accessible memory in some strange way or many of them are. So when you hear a three year old st do a six month, that is fucking crazy because it makes you wonder, is that one of them? Because that's one of the properties of DMT by the way in which is the psychedelic that's created by your own brain. One of the major properties of that dream is how profound the visions are. Incredibly powerful, but then they slip through your hands. They are gone. They're gone. Just like a dream. When you wake up from a dream and you try to explain it to somebody, you have a very small window. Will

Speaker 1:          01:54:56       you explain that dream consciousness? Yeah. There's powerful moments. Does eraser? Yes, but there's also a powerful, really good moments that I've had with each one of my kids and I can literally at of all the monster. I said, I don't remember this. You still let them in the museum of your mind. I have forgotten most, but there's a handful that I remember. Well, I say if it was yesterday, that was on a deeper spiritual conscious level where we just locked eyes and it was a moment and we just knew everything about each other. That Mo, I can't. Maybe I wanted that moment, but that's how it felt and I can count that with each one of my kids. Where I always go back to going, wow, I really know who you really are and I'm trying to get you back to that. Does it make sense?

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       Does I think that we have an accessible database, we have a hard drive, we have a certain amount of space and that's been proven when it comes to how many people you can know and keeping your life. They say that you could keep about 150 people in your life and you can sort of remember these people and you can you hold these people, but once you go past 1:50 it gets fucking slippery as shit and you must experience that because you're constantly meeting people and people know who you are and you don't remember them and after awhile you can go nice to meet you and they go. We already met. We met three years ago. Oh, I forgot. Yeah. I cannot maintain this many connections. The same basis drive issue. It's a literal hard drive issue. I forget what is the fucking. I know that it's not bodes laws the size of planets.

Speaker 1:          01:56:27       It's A. I forget the principal, but the principal is a 100 or whatever the word is. It's 150 people and you keep those hundred 50 people in your head and that's it. It correlates to what we were talking about with chimpanzees and anthropology, that there is a, there isn't an ideal size for a community before it becomes a disease to know to deal with, but those things you were talking about, your children. There are like a transcendent moment. Dunbar's number. That's it. Cool. Try and like you're talking about moments where it didn't matter that your individual way and that's individual, be that there's a clear connection that something. Parsley is between us and it was. It was overpowering and beautiful just for that moment and that keeps me going in certain moments of time, even though I'm 15 years later in 20, I I know know could describe it to me.

Speaker 1:          01:57:11       I just know that on some level that can be broken down I'm sure to sort of oxy toast in and like, oh, this is the shoreline was triggered by that. There is a sort of a mechanical or material component to even the most beautiful experiences of a sunset away, whatever it is, but my. But to return to what you were saying before of like how we have five or negative information, there's a clear evolutionary bias for like negative information has to be stored because you know he's not a career. Is that line you better. You know what I mean? You're fucked. If it's alliance. Negative information does have like priority, but what were you saying about like sort of this continued technological evolution? What I. What I think is that there's an imperative to have a comparable spiritual evolution revolution and that can occur is like the mortar.

Speaker 1:          01:57:58       I meditate and spent time doing that sort of stuff. It gives me a more of an awareness of the kind of phenomenon you're talking about, about the positive things and I'm like, you know about, oh my God, I must hold this moment in my heart. The moment where my dog done now or the moment I found out my girlfriend was pregnant. Don't fucking let this go this. Go make this part of who you are as a character and try to prioritize it over negative things or when someone hurts, you know, and, and I think that one has more determination over that more or 40 over that if you have meditation as part of Your Life, if you have a spiritual component to it. And that was when I was a teenager and noticed that my mates were all the time. It's like, you know, I'd hang out with my mates were smoking loads to draw.

Speaker 1:          01:58:36       Then we get in the car, we go out, they go to work. My mate would lucky worked in a car factory and then he would go and work doors to insecurity and I fought this guy. Never ever is like Justin. Yeah. He's never still, he's never in reflection is always engaged with some extent, for as a really lovely guy. As a matter of fact he was. But like I, I became aware then, but that's myself, that I was part of my addiction was these uncontrolled drives always want in something approval sex that I was unable to be still. And being so unlike so many fucking things like, you know, like I'm not Christian, but it's so many things, biblical things like, uh, you know, the Kingdom of Heaven is spread upon the earth, but man sees it not the Kingdom of Heaven is within. Be still and know that I am God, you know, like, you know, sort of like for me, all that fuzzy fucking rapture, cloud kingdom bullshit.

Speaker 1:          01:59:22       You know, that, you know, that's no use to anybody. But when people are saying to you, it's in there, it's in there. Is there already, you know, like there is no, of course we are also living in a material world and I'm a material girl. So because we can't drop the drive to continue to create these great achievements as a species. But a part of it has got to be you learn how to conduct yourself, learn how to connect your emotions, learn how to store positive experiences, and learn how to let go of negative ones. You know, if that, if that day originality with people. Yeah, we've all got our paths, everyone. We've all got our individual attributes and skills. Like you said, if we were on communism, the island, you know, you need people like to people to be realizing what is their part of the divine, what is the little part of you that's trying to realize itself, but life's kept fucking knocking you back in.

Speaker 1:          02:00:08       The systems kept breaking you down and you've not got to realize that thing that you can feel like a tree. You're trying to grow into your. That's the. That's the part of it I think can only happen as part of a spiritual evolution and I think you can even. You can only get the ticket to the spiritual evolution if you learn to deal with this fucking Matt stimulating bullshit that we're jacked up on. What's what you said, meditate. You turn it all off. It's really hard. I got turn it all off, nothing and your mind will have a chance to grow. I also think that that's where the compelling feeling to gravitate towards that comes from a dissatisfaction with the material world, dissatisfaction with this idea of possessions and that there is some sort of a weird ebb and flow and a Yin and Yang to the world and sometimes you have to see the fucking disastrous effects of just giving in to material possessions and the compelling feeling of wanting attention and nonsense and just gathering up items and living in the biggest house.

Speaker 1:          02:01:04       You have to almost feel the emptiness of that to gravitate towards a spiritual approach and I think that's one of the reasons why those things are there. It's almost like people do horrible things. Like sometimes I feel like horrible things when they're manifested by the human race. They sort of, they, they, they, they can give birth to a lot of positive reactions because people don't ever want to be like that and they see that and they go, well, this is definitely not the way to go because we're kind of all going through it together. One of the things about the human mind and the human experience like being a conscious human is we assume that we're this static thing. Meanwhile we're, we're very well aware that evolution

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       exists all throughout the natural world and we're also aware, well aware that we've only really been this thing for like what a half, a million quarter of a million years. It's not been that long that you could go back and find a, an ancient human and they look like you could put it in your clothes and put it in a movie theater and we wouldn't freak out. It's not that long. It's a short amount of time. So if you think about the fact that we know that these animals and these, these things are constantly evolving and changing and adapting all around us, why would we assume that we're in some sort of a static state? Why? I think that our own gravitation towards material possessions in our own use of this new form of interacting with each other through social media and the Internet and and movies and all those things are new.

Speaker 2:          02:02:24       We have to understand that mass media is fucking knew as shit. All of it. Newspapers are new as fuck everything. Everything's a couple hundred years old. The oldest shit is a couple hundred years old, photographs, couple hundred years old. We're dealing with really, really, really new influences on the mind and the mind is developing and expanding and reacting to all these new things and sometimes it reacts in a very negative way like it gravitates towards the Kardashians and it goes towards fucking possessions and it wants the shiniest new thing to show everybody that you've arrived and it's. It's a part of a cog in unconscious cog in this machine that's just producing new items and then sometimes there's a guy like you who sees that and goes, there is no soul to that. I'm going to jump in the fucking lake near these royals house and I'm going to experience what it's like to freeze my dick off and I'm going to carve a new path and I'm going to separate and I'm going to try domesticity and I'm going to try abstinence and I'm going to try to find some sort of a new way of addressing my dissatisfaction with the current state of the world that I find myself in that that was fucking good.

Speaker 2:          02:03:30       Rent. I needed a date. It was. It was. I mean it does that, but there's a part of that and all of us. We're all just going, this ain't it? Maybe this is. It does it in it. Maybe it's yoga, maybe it's scientology. Maybe it's being a moonie. Maybe it's this. Maybe it's that. Maybe it's maybe this fucking chick is holding me back. I need a goddamn divorce, but the fuck away from me. I know I'm going to wear a captain's outfit now. Find some chick lives by the beach. Go to the captain's outfit. We wanted to live out of my car and travel around the world. I'm going to put a bed in the back seat and you know, it's like this fax faction which has been happening forever. Just go right through there. Yeah, right through that door for that. Can I do it time?

Speaker 2:          02:04:16       I was trying to be a man. I mean for me to be in another room. They ain't got used lots of voices. We drank three waters. I've drank two in one and I got to Piss like a horse and I can hold this shit in for another day so it takes a strong bladder to do a podcast. Jim, by the way, I should just say what we're doing this. One of the reasons why I really got into on a podcast, there's a bunch of them, a opie and anthony were a big one, but you're fucking show was a big one man. When I did your show and we did it at that joke place, that joke place on Ventura Boulevard member. You were in La and you were in town and I had done your show like calling in before, but I'd never like. We've never done together. I was like, this is so fucking fun. Just hanging.

Speaker 4:          02:05:00       Well, what I loved about that one too is you. It what that thing allowed me to do is believe, believing, not thought provoking. Let other people to one that to me, one of the greatest moments ever was you called in and we wrote, we were all sitting there and I fuck you. Went into this whole thing of these are the Times of truth and this and that and I think you spoke for 45 minutes straight and I just kept looking. Everyone going, don't just let them go. This is, this is, this is fascinating. Let him go, where else can you have this? And one of my guys made like this whole pink floyd music and he put it on the air. I said, you've got to get that in the Internet and I think I remember calling your telling you go and show this is. That was the most fascinating thing ever heard in my life.

Speaker 4:          02:05:50       So I thought I was going to die, but it doesn't. I'm sure you are, but you never were allowed to even think like that on radio. And one of the things you said too, it's my favorite part was uh, and again I end up fear in it because I didn't want people thinking it was our opening song, which just explained, it was just four of us. We came out to, uh, get musicians that you came and you're like, drill. That is the, that is the greatest theme song I've ever heard in my life. And I was like, really? Yeah. What was you, what was me and the guys? And we were just really just talking and we've ripped it. And I said, don't even don't even change it. Let's just do that. It was perfect. It was real. Yes. And then I knew I, I knew when I heard you, you, you have, you need to be in this world. It's great to. It's, it's great to have you in this world. It's refreshing. It's thought provoking. It's powerful. It's. I love it, man. I'm very, very. I love it.

Speaker 2:          02:06:53       Yeah. Well, I love it too, man. It's a unique time that we can, we can have something like this. And when I was on your show, I was like, man, I need to get one of these satellite radio shows. These are the shit I didn't know that there was going to be an Internet version of that where you don't have any bosses and it reaches even more people. It doesn't make any sense at all. Who's somehow or another, a path has been carved through the information highways that people have never been on before. It's only like 10 years old. And through that path you reach everybody and it's free. Like it's, it violates all the ideas of capitalism. You don't have to pay for it. It's massively successful and there's a 500,000 of them and it lives forever, forever, forever. So people can constantly discover a.

Speaker 2:          02:07:37       Did you allegedly. Allegedly. I mean, I'm. What I'm saying is like, we might not make it an asteroid hits whatever until that happens, is be nice to know that someone that's never even heard of you. Oh yeah. In 20 years down the road they're going, you need to listen to this conversation. You know, Russell brand was in there and this day did he listened to that 20 years from now they're going, you know, that makes. That makes a lot of sense. That's pretty awesome. This is the great part of social media. Well, the grapevine, it's also that it's all free and that they're all available. You can get 800 plus episodes of this thing anytime you want it and when things are free, you can be more honest and more passionate about what you put out there because no one's paying you to say, well, did you ever get any pressure when you were doing the satellite show that ever?

Speaker 2:          02:08:23       Did anybody ever come to you and go ahead, Jim, you know, we're, we listen to that show and you guys are. You got to tone it down. Never. That's amazing. Never say never. Never, never, never. Because opie and Anthony got suspended a couple of times. Even from satellite radio. They were getting A. First of all, they were getting a lot of commercial money. Yup. Yup. That's certainly where they rubbed the wrong side of the madness. You know, it was all over Fox News. Look, you go to, well, they were kind of compromised in some sort of a weird way whether they want it to be or not because they were making a fuck load of money and as soon as a company is paying you x amount of money every year and they get upset about something or they feel it, feel like the Rav advertising revenue is going to dry up because you guys said something crazy like, you remember when they had that homeless guy on who said some crazy shit about Condoleezza Rice?

Speaker 2:          02:09:15       No. Yeah, they, they got suspended for like a year or like a month or something like that. They had, uh, some might be a week. I'm making up numbers. They um, had some homeless guy on it came on and said he wanted a rape Condoleeza Rice or something and they, you know, like what the fuck. And they just had some crazy guy off the street and he talked to all kinds of crazy nonsense and he left and you know, it's all alive. So it's nothing you could do about it. This guy in the air, I mean, what the fuck are they going to do it lp? Didn't say it. Anthony didn't say Norton didn't say it, but because it was on their show, they pulled the show and it was probably because of political pressure or pull up pressure from the Bush administration. This is also coincidentally during the time where, I mean Howard Stern, it was just after the time of Howard stern getting sued over and over again by the government.

Speaker 2:          02:10:00       Remember they would. They would give these massive lawsuits and that drove him to satellite radio. Right, and even in satellite radio they weren't safe, so even in satellite radio he moved to satellite radio. He moved to Sirius Xm at the time, I think it was before the merge of Sirius Xm or maybe right afterwards, but either way they. They weren't free. Even under the banner of this free thing on satellite radio. The political machine still had influence. Yeah. We'd never. We never were told, don't say this amazing. Don't do that. Because you had some wild fucking shows they would do. They would

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       go, hey, lisinopril ratings time. It looks good. If you guys were to come up with a biggie kind of entertaining show that would like that we can get out there. And the uh, did you get to choose guests? Um, yeah. They want to get. They weren't running to us. Trust me. You get to veto anybody usually I couldn't tell you who it was. A million guys suck. I don't know anything about this guy. I want to talk to them. What am I getting out of that? So they bring the politician. I'm just going to be a dick. Yeah. See, that's a beautiful thing about the time that you were involved in it too because you were involved in it. Back when I was on fear factor because the stunt guys fucking loved your show man. There was a, I had to do this thing where I got in the truck.

Speaker 4:          02:11:17       We had to drive to some location, was hanging out with the stunt guys and they were playing your show when it was on raw dog and they loved it and they were like, dude, brewers show is the fucking best. And it was really wild and raw and I was like, you maybe couldn't even do that today. Well those are my best friends growing up and my best friends was Jimmy Shaka who was deep and we would have these conversations for hours. And it really bothered me that there was no outlet for this anywhere. You had to be a freak or widow, a hippie or or whatever. And then I had another best friend on there who works for Fedex. He was, he had the blue collar. He stuck in that blue collar neighborhood. Little Ray says, but he won't really just two years and and the nucleus.

Speaker 4:          02:12:06       And then you had core Yeley who's just, he'll say whatever he was, he'll, he'll just go and say whatever and do whatever. So it was great to have all these different views, honest views. And if some days we just fit in. The big rule was no news, no pop culture. If you bring pop culture on the show, your route with were antipop culture. You're out, you're fired. Get that name, your band forever. Less beautiful. And a lot of ways. But it was saying too, it's just as a hang. I was trying to get it back to tribal is whatever. At the end of the day isn't some of the best times you have conversations like these or when you're with the people you trust the most. That could be the kid you grew up with. It could be. Can Be anyone, a family member, someone you just met and you're just hanging out at the end of the night.

Speaker 4:          02:12:53       You don't care if this one's dylan or that window. You're just hanging out. There's a fire, you're talking. At the end of the day, it's all the same shit. What's out there? Who really knows? What's this? Who really fucking knows? Let's talk about and try to figure out for three hours and what we get out of it. Poor. Really fucking know it's time for bed, but kids get now you have six hours, but if feel great that you're all doing it together. You trust each other. I'm not. Am I crazy for saying this? I might be. He'll tell me, dude, you fucking crazy. Why would you say that's stupid? That's stupid. Why is that stupid and just that that was pretty with each other and

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       they make more sense that way. If I trust you and your instincts in your mind that I'll tell you something that I believe in you, you refused it and they'll go, oh, okay. I have to consider his point of view because if I trust your point of view and your point of view differs from mine, well how did he come to this conclusion and why is it so different than my own? And by absorbing a bunch of different points of view like that, it gives you a much more nuanced perspective of this existence and you have to be open. I'm not out to win the conversation on just we're just here to learn from it more. That's important. People have to be open with that and I think we're. We've all been guilty of not being open to that before wanting to be right, but it's important to not just embrace being wrong, but try to understand why you were wrong.

Speaker 2:          02:14:09       Trying to understand like what it was and not be connected in some weird ego way to your ideas. It's hard to get just a joe fuck yeah, but it's like all those other things that we're talking about. I mean like you saying that you have this, this, this gravitation towards a expelling all of these ridiculous notions that everybody is just sort of accepted as fact and truth and trying to connect with a much more spiritual as well. That means you've got to think about and it's got to be a conscious thing and the same thing with not holding onto your ideas and not being married to them and not not being invested in being correct or incorrect, but just sort of accepting them as just ideas and be able to go, yeah, I think you're right. Why was I thinking that? And that's hard for people to do. I know this is stupid, but I saw a statement was in someone went and it was a tourist spot, but I pass the tourist spot and went in the house

Speaker 4:          02:15:03       and there was a statement in there and I know it just. It's simple, but it just blew my mind. It said one person could change the whole world for a better as long as they don't give a damn who gets that credit and that and I, and I thought like, if you really don't, if you just want to sit back, you just want to see things better and you really can change for the better, but you don't have to worry about going, you know, so and so said that or someone so set that up was so and so did that because now you're doing it for different reasons.

Speaker 3:          02:15:37       Yeah. I never had that before. I'd never heard that before until like yesterday I saw like I saw that quote intimate. It can. That's a problem that I continually have to almost ideas. And that's, I think part of what's excellent about this medium and particularly the way it's been executed by you look, is that it's, it's discourse, you know, let these kind of things. Not really, you know, like you said, the fast moving fast cut sound bite tv, just bombarding with an artillery of mostly erroneous information. You don't get to people here. People our, after our talk in examining this guarding as you said, who really knows and returning to that point, it's sort of, it's sort of encouraging because I've had like, you know, like as I like, I've always felt like an I don't like agree with like a bill o'reilly

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       or Sean Hannity or those guys. I've always kind fall apart. I think they were right if I hung out with. There's something about Bill O'Reilly Camacho carve. Oh, come on. Like I think, I think he was kind of okay. I think you would joke around with them and you guys probably start laughing about some things and that's kind of a reassuring thing, isn't it? And to not be kind of like once you get a Ta, like I think that's what's kind of ugly about both liberalism and neoliberalism is you can see it as people just forcing their idea and they've lost touch with. And I do it all the fucking time. Yeah. Let's start with what is it that we're genuinely here for. And that thing you said of like you can change the world if you know no one. Like if you're willing to do, if no one knowing about it, that's like, ah, the, the, the pangs I feel in my gut shows me how much my ego is still involved in the shit I do.

Speaker 1:          02:17:17       Discourse. I just saw it. I didn't say it, but the lack of discourse, like what we were talking about being one of the more important things about podcasts or one of the best things about podcasts. I mean, I, I'm, I'm really hoping that that's the trend of the future, that people understand that there's, this might not be a right way or a wrong way to do a lot of these things and that your point of view, whether you strongly believe it or not might not really work for the way I see the world. It doesn't mean that your right or I'm wrong or it doesn't. It doesn't. I mean there's some certain truths like, Hey, don't rape people. Hey, don't murder people. Those things are obvious, but there's some other things that aren't obvious. You know, there's other things. Rob, not obvious, like maybe you shouldn't hurt people's feelings.

Speaker 1:          02:17:58       Something. Maybe you should them because what they're doing is preposterous and in hurting their feelings, you actually elevate all of us to realize the humor in their folly and I'm a big fan of folly. I enjoy human folly. It's one of the things I enjoy most about humans. I'm the quickest to make fun of my own self, so if I can't make fun of them, what kind of a fucking goofy ass world that we run and we run into some super sensitive world where everyone's a perfect snowflake and we can't shit on them. Like nonsense. You need humility. Humility is also. Humor is really important to unpackage things like because there was a lot of things that are going on right now in this world that are a little fucking weird and one of the reasons why they're weird is because humor hasn't had a chance to dissect them.

Speaker 1:          02:18:39       Wow. I think that A. Please talking about comedy and he said that people talk about like the people are very and humor because they know it's powerful and they often use the idea that tell, don't talk, don't, don't joke around. This is serious. Supposed to joke around about things serious and he they have mistaken seriousness for solemnity, you know, there's no reason they want to be all solid about stuff because they know it prevents people that have got that comedic switchblade from getting into the argument. We can exactly taking that seriously. I'm not playing by those rules and they've also taken away your special power special power habit. This special power. Both of you guys have it like they don't have it, so if you come in and you deflate their argument with a quick switchblade, oh, a piece of shit while you're joking around

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       about something really important, maybe your white privilege is showing. Maybe you should consider the fact that your humor is offensive to people and what you're doing. It's bullshit and it's not helping. It's very regressive. Trying to stitch it into political. One of the real problems with the left and especially the regressive left and the PR people that think that they're going to change things, they're fucking unbelievably mean when they're mocking the right. Like you're talking about compassion, like I've seen some of the most, the least compassion, meanest, angriest shit come out of people that consider themselves to be liberal and progressive and their ideas to close down discourse where they're going to do is going to shit on you and insult you and then gang up and some sort of a weird bully pulpit to attack all the people that don't agree with them.

Speaker 3:          02:20:18       We're not going involved in politics in my country doing that thing. The truth, the most number of book as well called Revolution. And in that book I talked about it. It was basically a book those meant to be for younger people and it was like, this is my perspective on why I don't believe in this stuff and why I believe in this. And it was really, you know, it was relatively simple. And again, I'm like a self taught person. So it's not a book by fucking academic, right? The worst vitriol and their worst condemnation came from the kind of newspapers and liberal organizations that would think would be supportive of such. Like it's good that he's guy from the world of popular entertainment who's not a classically educated. It's trying to do that. No, they came in, they came in like get the fuck out of our

Speaker 2:          02:20:59       territory. Who Do you think

Speaker 3:          02:21:03       more than any kind of like a sort of right wing organization that they almost see it has gone wrong. Jolly good. Yeah. I was really like. I was very. Some people that I thought might be allies, organizations I thought might be encouraging. We're very condemnatory.

Speaker 2:          02:21:18       Well, you going to realize the what is the mechanism that they're distributing this information with? You know what they're doing there. They're writing their own stories. They're promoting their own blogs. They're doing their own radio shows and in fact feeding their own ego like we were talking about before, that green monster of envy that sees this fucking guy with beautiful bone structure and the beautiful accent. Now I'm philosophizing this piece of shit he had. He had the wherewithal and the power to go on a sexual rampage. Chose to back off of it and realize like all these fucking goddamn things he's got going for him. He's a fucking movie star. Fuck this guy. Fuck this guy. I'm telling him I'm tearing them down, honey, and he's sitting there with his pot belly fucking taken his antidepressants and tap tapping away mean shit on the keyboard hoping and hoping that these mean words hit your mind and they enter into your consciousness and he can affect you in some sort of a horrible way.

Speaker 2:          02:22:13       Oh God. The lack of extreme lack of compassion from some people on the left and the green light to attack this fact that, oh, here's this guy and I don't agree with him and I think that what he's doing is sexist and it's massage and nearest dick and it's enabling and let's get them. Well, you got to fucking target right on his back attack. Oh, he's doing press. Oh, well, I'm going to be involved in this press. I don't know. Throw my hat into the ring as the arbiter of intelligent ideas to dismay or dismantle rather all these fucking stupid thoughts at this shit head with his perfect bone structure and men bonds pumping out. Fuck him. Fuck him. Professional wrestling, you know, professional wrestling. Well, people, man, people jockeying for their own little fucking shining moment in the darkness. Pizza Front. See, I go conspiracy pizza front, right? Here's what our magazines and bend. So yours. Is it conspiracy? It's just a thought. Why does it have to be cold conspiracy? I think the word conspiracy is a conspiracy conspiracy best at this through the looking glass. Now conspiracy in itself is a conspiracy. Him. He's fucking shut it all down.

Speaker 2:          02:23:36       Yeah. Um, I mean there's definitely some real conspiracies, but uh, I think that there's just an unnatural emphasis of our natural inclination to Shit on people that are doing better than you are. Shit on people that have something good going on. And also when you're writing a story about something w, how much fun is it running a story that's positive and how much more satisfying is it to unhappy people to write a negative review about something so much more exciting? It's much more fun. I've seen people distort people's ideas and really horrific ways because that's the old way because the old way you could write a blog about something or an article in a magazine or whatever about someone and distort it in horrible ways and they really didn't have any recourse, but that old way doesn't really work anymore because it's direct access because of media like this.

Speaker 2:          02:24:22       Sure. So I'm thinking that I would like to start a podcast. I'm thinking you should definitely have never done a podcast in my games. They went in my country. Oh my gosh. You can do it anywhere you go. Do whatever you want. Yeah, you can bring them whenever you want. I might have done them in Australia. I've done them all over the world. You, you do it anywhere you want. All you have to have a phone. You do it into your iphone. Exactly. I just talk on my phone. I just talk on my phone. I like it. You dumping that. You don't have to edit. You know it's on your phone, your podcasts on your phone, dude. Your design, your desire. You are. And not only that, you don't even have to have a guest you want, but you don't. You could have a guest on if you want, but like bill burrs, one of the best podcasts in the world, and Bill Burgess rants, unbelievable.

Speaker 2:          02:25:04       He rants for like, he'll just sit down for a fucking hour and a half and just go off about this and that. And it's a stream of consciousness. So it goes from football to his wife or his fucking dog and baking and his internet socks and he's tired of construction workers and his driveway is a piece of shit and he just, he'll go on and on and on. And you can do that too. What main things you've learned from doing this? What are the main things you think? Right? This is how you do a podcast. One of the things that the rules, the structures that you have learned, man, that's, there's almost. I've learned so much. I've learned how other people perceive me. I've learned how I perceive other people. I've learned what my, maybe my own problems and perception are. I've, uh, I've sort of tried to examine as many things as possible.

Speaker 2:          02:25:49       It's a master course in human interaction for me. That's what I've thought of it. I mean I've had 800 plus podcasts where I'm interacting with all sorts of different people. So it's um, it's a fascinating way to understand how people think and to just chunk data, just chunk data about how people react and talk and communicate. How has it evolved from your original vision of doing a hook costing to how it is now? If you become more free with it? Less formulated? Well, I don't think it was ever formulated, but I've been better at it. I'm just better at it. But the, when the podcast started out, it was just, I just wanted to figure out a way to do something like something free where you're just doing it with a camera or you're responding to twitter questions or to trying to out. My thought was I've done a bunch of radio shows everywhere I go everywhere I go and promote a comedy gig.

Speaker 2:          02:26:41       I do a morning show. I had a great time. Gosh, I would love to do one of those, but that was so much fun. I would love a radio show, but I don't want a boss and that was trying to figure out how the fuck can I do this? And then doing Jim's show and doing the opiod, Anthony Show opiod, not it was the greatest. It was the greatest because when they were together, their show was a hang on. If I could call Jim and I'd go, Hey, uh, I'm doing opie and Anthony tomorrow morning. He's like, fuck, I'm doing it too. Like, oh, it's going to be so much fun. And we would see each other and get a Bagel in the morning and high five and go up there and just laugh. Right. And you're able to do your own thing. No one's trying to out, you know, it.

Speaker 2:          02:27:15       It was. That place taught me everything. I was hoping it was a hanging. That was the original Shang. I'd never heard anything like that. Yeah, it was the only radio show that was a real hang where you go in there and everyone's just hanging out. And then Jim started doing his show, which is very similar when I could get to you, you, your show was a hang too. It was a hand because I wanted that model. I loved going into Opie and Anthony and just sitting down and they're like, what's up night? You didn't have to be on. Yeah, they didn't. Like if you did bits come in and do a bit, a bit. Don't do a bit. Just talk. Yeah. We want to know that that goes probably what you went through to get where you can say Russell authenticity about being, trying to be in normal and being who you are.

Speaker 2:          02:27:59       Yeah. No imposing. Like come in and write up in five seconds. We got lucky with all of those things like having a boss and having structure and having that commercial interests constantly and you're an intelligent person and people like listening to the real you and you don't get that opportunity a whole lot. They gave you that opportunity like, Whoa, this is a whole different. I never knew this existed from this person. I don't like this person's calm. I'm sure people hate my book. And I thought, but I like what he's like when he talks real, so that opens up, it opens up the opportunity for all of that. It was, it was going to say it was like a revolution. It was pretty. It was pretty intense and I can see what you mean. That that was sort of pop the transition and how it actually works as well.

Speaker 2:          02:28:45       Like someone that someone that was so pi. He is absolutely the original. He's absolutely, he's the first. He's the most important guy in the history of radio because he was the first guy that got arrested or a find rather he got in some serious legal problems because of the things that he was saying on the air and kept doing it. And he was the original guy, just be blatantly honest. And he was the first real reality show. He'd call his wife, call. Oh the guys working on the light. Let me talk to him. Let me talk to the. He said like he's getting took, I want to talk to. And he did all this on regular radio, right when no one was doing that and everybody was playing music. So they were all. They would have like these little things they would do and then they would play a song and he had to do that in the beginning.

Speaker 2:          02:29:31       Songs, he would make his humor in between the songs but eventually was like, fuck these songs, I'm just gonna I'm just going to be me and have a good time and talk shit. And he figured out how to do it. He was more rigid and structured. Whereas opie and Anthony, when they would have guests on, like, like brewer and I would be on maybe burwood beyond or some other people would beyond and we'd all beyond together and would just go in there and we'd hang out and it was literally like, the time would fly so fast. We. It wasn't a matter of not having enough content. It was like too much content, not enough time. And Howard didn't have that. It was almost like they wouldn't. Howard didn't have that opportunity at the time or he just came out in a different way. And then once he went to the Internet, I think that blew up to another hole at blew him up to and everyone said, hi, you know, where's he now?

Speaker 2:          02:30:18       I think he's 10 times, hundred times bigger and more powerful. And it became a. He evolved in terms of content or do you mean every for me, everything, everything. Conversation thought. Well, as soon as things get on the Internet, then they can spread freely. So the merit of the conversation. What's interesting about the conversation? Then it just gets passed around and as soon as things just get passed around like that, then someone calls him, Oh my God, you got to hear Jim Brewer who was on Howard Stern. Holy Shit. Is it funny? If you heard it, you got link and they send you a link. And Bam. And the beautiful thing about podcasts is someone can tell me, dude, Russell's got a podcast. You've got to check it out. Oh, let me check it out. And then you go on your itunes to nap and you go run.

Speaker 2:          02:30:56       There is Bam. And then you're playing it like in seconds you're in your car and you're playing it and it's free. And now if I just discovered you, I'm going to go. I want to hear more. I want to hear. Oh you got to listen to like one of his first ones where he wasn't even ready. He know what he was doing. You gotta listen where it went from here to here. Yeah. Once they're in, they're in. They love you. They know you. They feel like they're all exposed will if you add that you liked were hard or like, you know, like see, because you've not got bosses or anything. Was there ever times you are going to. We should never read that guy on that was a mistake. A couple minor ones. Nothing serious. Just weird conversations where you just kinda learn better about how to handle those moments.

Speaker 2:          02:31:36       It's, it's a, it's almost like you're learning on the job, right? It's like I never did a radio show before. I never spoke open as a form of entertainment. Not Arrogant. Not just to think that you should be able to speak. I mean, of course everyone should be able to speak, but the fact that you think that your words are so interesting that other people are gonna listen to them and they're going to, instead of talking to themselves, they can just listen to your talking. Why the fuck would they do that? They're not even there. You know, like it's not like someone's right in front of you and you're talking to me trying to be polite so you'll let them talk. No, you're, you're, you're downloading their shit so you can listen to them talk and then you're not gonna talk while they're talking. Like what?

Speaker 2:          02:32:12       This is madness, right? So in learning how to broad broadcast in air quotes, learning how to do that, you kind of learning by, by feedback and also by listening yourself and listening to other people's podcasts, you'll see other things that great on you about what other people do. Like talking over people. That's a big one. We all do it, which we all shouldn't, but we all have an idea that we want to get out and we don't know when to do it and it's hard to figure out because we're all free ball and when to jump in and when not to. Also, some people don't listen to the things that other people say. They just wait for their turn to talk. That is a real issue. That's a giant issue because then you ask them about what you just said and they're like, I wasn't listening.

Speaker 2:          02:32:50       Like how can you not be listening when we're talking like this is okay. They will. Then now we're not really having a conversation. We're just exchanging rants, you know, and I'm waiting for you to get your completely nonsequitor rant in and then you're going to impress people with your quotes and home, which you know about this guy or that guy. And that's a real common thing is like using it as an ego springboard instead of looking at it in the podcast is really essentially a piece of art in a grandiose term, but you're creating something and you want to create it. The best way you can and you could fuck it up by being loud and stupid and saying a bunch of dumb shit that doesn't feel good to anybody here. Or You could say some cool shit that when they listen to this podcast, after it's over, they go, fuck at Russell brand, said something that's going to change the way I look at the rest of my fucking life and that's, that's possible.

Speaker 2:          02:33:40       And that's one of the bases entirely. Like do you think then this is entirely authentic self that you don't like? Stuff that you withhold when you're in this situation? Because I've come from more conventional media and information about loved ones. That's it. That's it. I don't, I don't know anything. I don't want to hurt any. I don't want anybody of anybody else's feelings get hurt or you know, things along those lines. But I've made those mistakes smart just because it's funny. It's a funny team there. Yeah. It's not their choice, you know, so you have to, you have to withhold certain things and you know, some people just want to be private people. They don't want to have any part of your fucking parade. You weirdo out there talking to the world everyday. Have you had any. Have you had any negative consequences as a result of it?

Speaker 2:          02:34:28       Because you have to work in other industries and all of that. It's only positive. I don't give a fuck, so it doesn't really matter. If you have fuck you money, you don't say fuck you, you're wasting fuck you money. So if I have some real thoughts and I don't express them because I'm worried about job opportunities like I'm already in prison, whether I like it or not. If there's something important that I have to say and then the jobs that you do get or the employment opportunities that you do get, they'll be looking for your authentic self and let's say it's some like the same sort of situation with some crazy woman likes to take some guy and change them all. He's a fixer upper like they're not. They're not going to grab you and go, this Russell brand's talking a lot of crazy revolution.

Speaker 2:          02:35:08       Once we get them in the network, I'm in a nice suit. He's gonna. He's gonna be the best talk show host ever. He's the future Jimmy Fallon. And at the end of the day, yes. If it comes to entertainment, your number. So does he matter what you say? They believe it or not. Believe it and you get these people. Don't. Doesn't matter. I think we should put him in this movie because he's worth this much and think of will make this much this many people automatically buy tickets because his following is interview. You almost start controlling your own destiny that happened as a result. Things happen to you. Awful. I don't. Well what do you mean not having someone gone? Why don't we put fucking Joe Rogan in this action movie? You got fucking massive, but I don't. I don't. I'm not interested in doing anything. I'm interested in doing less things.

Speaker 2:          02:35:58       I'm not interested in anything new. I don't want to do any movies. I like doing stuff that has nothing to do with work. Like I like doing yoga and I like doing archery. I like writing comedy. I like performing standup. I liked to on podcasts I like, I like just doing stuff. I don't want to do someone else's stuff, you know, some movie came along and it was really interesting and for whatever reason it was a short amount of time. I would have to work, I would consider it, but I've passed on a lot of stuff. I just don't have any interest in it. He's taking control of your life through this. Yeah. Well I've been doing what I actually want to do instead of when you know, and Jim and I were in a pilot for the very first TV show that I did in 1993 and we've been friends for longer before that, way long before that.

Speaker 2:          02:36:40       But you, you come here and you think I've now I'm going to do this project. Oh boy. I'm in. I'm on a TV show and you and then you get on the TV, show you up. You know what? I don't even like this that much. I liked doing. Stand up. Why am I doing this? You're doing this because they keep coming to you like, Hey, we've got a game show and they're gonna eat animal dicks and you're going to shoot them out of a rocket. What do you know? Like, I'm in, it's on TV. I'm in. That's what I'm here for, and the money is real fucking good. You do it after a while and you go, hey, you know what? That's not what I enjoy doing. What do I actually enjoy doing? Well, I'm just trying to do the things I enjoy doing. What I enjoy doing.

Speaker 2:          02:37:15       I like doing podcasts. I like doing standup. I like and doing all those extracurricular things that I do, the things that I do that are just interested in life and then I don't want to differentiate between interests that I do for financial gain or interest to it that I do for mental exercises or for spiritual growth or whatever. I just want to do things that I enjoy doing. That's really important, isn't it? You guys sound fair enough and so many people don't have that kind of freedom creatively on any level. The freedom of it. I just want the that should be part of more people's experience of life. I'm happy doing this. It makes me like. It's really beautiful to hear that, that what you're led by his joy because that is another Joseph Campbell thing. Follow your bliss. Find the thing that you're connected to and follow it, and when I think of how many times in my life I've got, I've lived out other people's ideas as you say, like, Oh, right now this is.

Speaker 2:          02:38:04       Hold on a minute. This is what I'm. This is what I'm supposed to do. Like again, like Bill Hicks says, they just look at my money. This has to be real to be real because you're bombarded with it and then you realize, oh my God, so if you are lucky enough to get to a position where you can just do things that you enjoy, but how do you. Do you think that idea that you've applied to your own creative lives can be applied? If you're fucking living a normal life and you're trapped in a job that you don't fucking like, how do you think you'd get out of that situation? It's like everything else, it takes small baby steps to move out, you know, you've got to move towards that direction. You have to have an absolute game plan and you have to have an actual thing that you enjoy doing.

Speaker 2:          02:38:44       Like say if you're some guy that's trapped in some job but you know, to bring up something we talked about before, what you enjoy making homemade knives and you think you're like, you know, I would love to just be able to make arts and crafts to be able to create something that people bond, maybe pottery or something along those lines that really feel like spiritually and creatively satisfying to me. To be able to express myself in it, an art form that to do that for a living would be amazing. And there's a lot of people that start off in regular jobs and they figure out a way to get to that place and it's not easy and people will fucking bitch and Moan at you and tell you how not easy it is. And Yeah, you're saying it's making it seem like it's easy. It's not easy.

Speaker 2:          02:39:22       A lot of us have problems and we got mortgages and children and I need a healthcare packaging. Everybody has resistance. There's always resistance to anything that you're trying to achieve in life and everybody's set up might be different. Everybody's needs and requirements might be different. They're all different, but if you find whatever the fuck it is that you can do, I guarantee you, you have some time in your day that you can dedicate towards making that a reality. It's a matter of making that time a priority to try to change your current state of existence. How do you do it? I don't know. I don't know what your existence is and I can't tell you anyway because what the way I do things and the way you do things is fucking totally different. Everyone's going to do things different. I'm a kamikaze person. I'm like, let's fucking cut ties, Polish, shoot, let's go.

Speaker 2:          02:40:10       I'm like, let's get outta here. Let's quit. You know? Um, but I've always like that. I've always been the burn the fucking house down. You got to make another one. That's, that's my, my thought has been just abandoned ship. Let's get Outta here and find the fucking new thing, but you can't do that when you have a wife and children and now luckily for me when I was young and taking crazy chances and moving towards a career and doing something I actually wanted to do, I didn't have anybody else that I had that counted on me. Once you do, it becomes much more difficult but not insurmountable. It didn't completely dependent upon what it is you're trying to achieve. I like that we can start. Good. Well going to say like, you know, sort of

Speaker 3:          02:40:48       how do you bridge. You aren't going to, like I said, that thing to Tom Cruise, that time of being born with that drive, being born with that knowledge of I'm going to do this because I identify with that crash and burn thing and it's been problematic in my life with relationships and stuff. I've got a survival instinct in me and it's like, this is fucking mad. I'm out.

Speaker 2:          02:41:06       Yeah, but that's good. How many people fucking stay and get tortured sophie when that hard tech comes finally aren't going away from this con. Well, I hope your head, but if see my fingers,

Speaker 3:          02:41:26       I would like more people in the world. Like it will be like Jesus for more people to have that opportunity. Like it makes me sad so that people will be listening to this thinking I fucking won. Now I want to make my fucking art and craft knives. I wanted it like that. If you, if you've not got place for that in your life, then you will, like you were saying when you were in prison, you have your fucking fucked anyway and let you know and there are certain systemic changes that could be bought back that would mean that more people would have that opportunity. That's the other thing that makes me sad. Systemic changes. Well, I mean he's, he's. But if we didn't have a culture that was entirely dominated by one economic idea, that more people would be able to sit around making art and crafts, not the finger of the things that keep coming up again and again.

Speaker 3:          02:42:02       This conversation, people should live in small tribes. I mean, right? So why the fuck are we not trying to do that shit now? Why are we not going to like, you know why we don't go in, right? Let's try another word for tribes. Soviet and people did ever go terribly, terribly wrong, but what I'm saying, they start doing these kind of ideas. I mean, look, now I'd be like, I wonder if that's that, you know, that's the template. What's the next level of this is like, right, but let's try and work on that. Then they try and bring some of these ideas like you have as an individual, like can this be collectivized? Can this be brought forward so that more people like, you know, do you take that leap of faith that fuck me, if we do get hundred 50 people together, of course it's going to be problems, challenges, problems and fucking challenges. Now we're not competing with perfection. We compete with a defunct system that's really causing a great deal of negativity and problems. What would happen if people did start to try and create alternatives are to what happened? You'd be killed. No, I don't think. You don't think so? No code right out. If you end right, we're setting up a system, hundred 50 people where this is our new podcast experiment. We're setting up a utopia.

Speaker 2:          02:43:03       Only when you become a threat and you have to become a threat financially or you have to become a threat militarily. One of the things about these fucking Waco type, they always gathered guns did fuck everybody's wives and they have a

Speaker 4:          02:43:16       pile of ammunition. Then you become a threat, David. What's the stockpile of guns in the fucking? Everyone's saying, oh, I just focused on Jesus, so Jesus rose, right? Once you become a threat, and that's the only way violence is the only real threat to expound on those ideas and spread those ideas. It's controversial, but I don't think anybody looks at it and says, you know what? This motherfucker is going to take money out of my bank account. I think people were so engrossed in their own life and their own progress, their own path of conquering. I don't think they think about it that way unless you crossed them and unless you. Like you say, you know what, God dammit this Rupert Murdoch is fucking up the world. That I'm going to expose him and I'm going to let the world. Then you've created an issue. Then you've gone into battle with a man with unfathomable resources that tried. That didn't work out.

Speaker 4:          02:44:16       Done bloody sick of all this. You see his wife, he's got a hot wife. Cool. CIS. Amazing. I love how stereotypes just play themselves out over and over and over. Donald Trump's wife. I go, that's what I like to see the same thing over and over again. Tapping. I'm in pain. I got to pee. Go ahead man. No worries. Yeah, I think. I think we, you know, one of the things Mckenna said that always resonated with me is that so many people do the man's work for the man and they're so worried about the repercussions of being free or expressing themselves or discussing psychedelics. They do the man's work for the man

Speaker 2:          02:44:58       by not by being scared and shackling themselves and expressing yourself in a way that makes sense. You know, like I think one of the things that's most interesting about Mckenna's lectures where he was in sort of the infancy of the Internet where you did a lot of them is he expressed himself in a, in a way that's kind of really similar to like podcasts rants, but way before their time. He was doing it in front of these groups of people and someone recorded it so he would have these meetings, you know, that people come to hear him speak and he would have these meetings and he would, a lot of times you would open up the room for questions and he would just sort of rant and you know, he's a consummate consumer of cannabis, so he's high as fuck. And he's having these bizarre conversations, these rants rigs exploring these ideas and he got better and better and better at them all throughout these rants. And when he's doing these, he's essentially doing a podcast. It takes a long time to hear.

Speaker 4:          02:45:54       He was. Do you think of him just sort of a modern secular profit? Because if you sort of like, if you've been into the comedy of Bill Hicks and then you listen to terrence Mckenna, you can see like, oh fuck, he's clearly influenced. The. I found out about Mckenna

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       was to Hicks bit [inaudible] Hicks had this bit about what he, he said what Terence Mckenna would describe as a heroic dose of mushrooms. So I was like, who the fuck is Terence Mckenna? And this was, you know, the nineties when I heard this. So I had seen Hicks live a couple times for three or four times I guess in Boston. And um, what was that? It was amazing. First Time I saw him, it was an accident. First Time I saw him I went to see some comedians that were like local Boston guys and Hicks had come in from out of town and I don't know if he was supposed to be there the next night or what it was, but no one was there to see him. They didn't know who he was. And he went up on stage and was just so weird. And he was doing this bit about tiffany meeting Jimmy Hendrix.

Speaker 2:          02:47:02       At the mall, you know, that uh, like this music that they're promoting is pop culture, bullshit music and, and he was at the comedy connection in Boston. I saw him think I saw him there first and I saw him at Nick's and a couple other places. But uh, he was, he was doing some new thing. I was like, okay, this is a new kind of comedy. This is like Sam Kinison, but with much more of an emphasis on the realization that the patterns were all falling into whether it's pop culture patterns or at these things are actually detrimental that these things are, they're foolish way to approach this world. This world is incredibly complex and we could all look at it together. And I was like, well, this is, this is a new kind of comedy. How is he going down in the booth? Really good and really bad.

Speaker 2:          02:47:48       I saw him bomb horribly, but bomb with grace that I've never achieved. He, he bombed. He didn't give a fuck about bombing. I've never been able to do that. He, he bombed like a guy who almost knew the future, knew he was going to have some sort of an impact on the culture and knew that this was just a footnote in that incredibly impactful experience on the art form of standup comedy and also knew that eventually he'd find his own audience, which he did not have at the time because he was at a small comedy club. Nick's comedy stop in Boston, which is a couple hundred people. And um, there was a guy who went on before him who was a real hack, nice guy, but just hacky, hacky bullshit cop donut jokes, that kind of shit. Just everything you've already heard before. Nothing original. And he was killing, killing with others.

Speaker 2:          02:48:33       Simple stupid shit. And then Hicks went on afterwards with this, like really bizarre interpretation of modern civilization ever is like, fuck this guy. And people were getting up and leaving in droves and uh, kept going through the whole thing. And me and Greg Fitzsimmons was there and a bunch of other comedians watching them bomb. We were laughing our asses off. So he was playing to the back of the room, the comedians that were still there laughing. We're laughing hard and support, but people are getting up and giant chunks and leaving at the end of the show, you know, the show was whittled down from like 250 people to like 40 people in 15 or 20 comics. That was all that was left and we were howling laughing and he got offstage. Like nothing happened. He would not compromise. Who's an interesting guy.

Speaker 3:          02:49:17       So then go on and then that's it. That's what he kicks you off into the Mckenna realm.

Speaker 2:          02:49:22       Yeah, he, he's one introduced me to Mckenna by that joke. Just by saying that. And then in hearing Hicks's references, you know, he was, there was a few other guys that he sort of referenced their ideas. Like Noam Chomsky was another one. Like one of the things that Hicks was famous for saying was actually a chomsky line was that about the Iraq war, that it's only really in a war when two armies are fighting, you know. And that was, like I said, direct Chmielowski quote. It is, and it's a hicks. Well He, you know, it's not, I don't want, I don't want to say it's plagiarism because I bet if you asked him, he would tell you it's a noam chomsky quote, but he was introducing that concept and that idea to these people through the world of standup comedy and then from there he expanded on that with all of his material about the Iraq war and the all the new weapons that they're doing and forming equipment.

Speaker 3:          02:50:12       I'm starting that shame bit. Yeah. So. And I think you give him that because it's so like the stuff he was doing was so innovative and incredible and funny. Lucky. Like I sort of say you look to and say you said Kennison or lenny bruce before that, like what I've experienced of them and I'm not by any means and authority. He did like Bill Hicks did make it more densely humorous. Maybe not when you see him live on that, but by the time he was recording specialist and stuff. Sure. I also live A. I've always thought that Bill Hicks was extremely refined and honed. What was neat. It's like, you know, like you can see incarnations of the same content many, many times with him where he, at least in the stuff that I saw because I've only ever seen him know, recorded. He wasn't going out. He wasn't like doing lots of spontaneity and lots of luck. It was like they were like beautiful, very articular pieces of.

Speaker 2:          02:51:06       Yeah. And sometimes they didn't even make people laugh. You know, I watched it with his girl I was dating at the time in like 19 or 23 ish, something like that. And she was like, yeah, he's not really funny, but he's really fascinating to listen to. Like she didn't find like some of the things he was saying were funny, but I think that was also the revelation show which you filmed in London, which was one of those weird shows where you're doing an hbo special and you have one show ready go and there's some weird pressure that's involved with that and it doesn't necessarily always come off loose and like the feeling that you see him when he's at a club where he's expressing himself in a much more freeway.

Speaker 3:          02:51:47       I felt that he's a lot of his comedy as high points. Of course he's content came from his ability to do characterization that you do like a sort of a long bit that used to like, oh my God, this guy is just hitting me with data. But like when he died, oh believe God created a in one day. But those things,

Speaker 1:          02:52:04       it looks like he rushed it. Rafiki doesn't let you off and then. And then as well that the thing that we're good. I think that revelations was the first thing that I ever saw of. He's like when I was like was a kid, but when he does the market in France, you know, like in one advertising mock and Kudos, I couldn't, you know, I couldn't believe his sincerity. I couldn't believe that someone would hit you with that much heart. Quit putting a dollar sign and every damn thing on this planet. But something like that. Some of it. So that was from the heart, Huh?

Speaker 2:          02:52:37       Resonated. Whenever someone, something resonates and stays. I mean, it's also, there's so much mythology involved in him now because he's passed on and he died young and we always sit back and wonder like, what would it be?

Speaker 1:          02:52:48       I liked that guy was alive today. He didn't have the outlet then where that's again, now you can go back and look at a guy like that because it's there and back then you weren't ready to handle that. Who's talking like, I'm coming to comedy club. I want to. I want to laugh. Yeah. I to think tonight will Hicks Hicks was, you know, I don't know what you're saying.

Speaker 2:          02:53:12       So kennison opened the door for him because he was one of the outlaws and Kennison had a lot of bits that were like that, but they were more humor based than point of view based like he had points of view. But the point of view had to be really funny. Whereas Hicks had a lot of points of view. There's like there's gotta be a way to introduce these ideas into people in the form of standup comedy that maybe not even aren't that funny but are very important. Whereas Kennison was, everything was, I mean he had some ridiculously funny bits and he did it in this totally unapologetic way that I think Hicks kind of absorbed and when I first saw Hicks is one of the things he had a lot of Kennison in him, like we all have influences and when we're starting out we like to hear other comedians that you really love come out of your own mouth, almost like with the intonations and the inflections and you almost kind of mimic them in your delivery.

Speaker 2:          02:54:06       And Hicks did a lot of that. When I first saw him, he was doing a lot of Kennison and it was interesting. It was like this guy is clearly influenced and. Well, one of the. Okay. You don't know whether or not he was influenced by Kinesin or kinison was influenced by Hex, but most likely it's probably a little bit of both, but more Kennison than anything because Kennison was much more successful earlier on, like several years before Hicks really took off and was revolutionary. When Kennison came on the scene. He was completely revolutionary. So I think him taking Hicks with him, you know, because they were a part of that Houston group that originally expanded and then came to la. I think he just showed that there's, there's just some unbilled undeniable power and being that controversial but on point

Speaker 1:          02:54:51       what startup is one of the original American art form, isn't it? It's like there is precedent prior to America. Proprietor being in the United States was not like that art form exist in the same way. Let's go gestures or just as Rava or music call. It didn't exist in that kind of way. And in a, in a manner like it's a very. Podcasting is very natural medium for a comedian because it grants you that long form because I've always thought like the, you know, the, the more it can be that the more truthful you are and the more articulate become, the more you reduce your audience. You know, when you think of like he liked hitting up rooms have 2,500 people or 5,000, you know, arena gigs. Like if you want to go in the white in there with fucking Noam Chomsky, bloody quotes finished. Exactly. Yeah. You got to have some way to connect those things with humor bound.

Speaker 1:          02:55:44       Almost like scaffolding in between ideas. Yeah. Yeah, because you've got that. That's the thing I think about sort of like keeping the ball above a certain level and in a way this medium, your are relief that, that you are allowed. It's like, oh, sit back for awhile. Listen for ages. But they, the, the aspect of comedy that I think is so important of authenticity, you know when people, when you are a startup comic, people go, Oh, you got to find your voice. You got to find your authenticity in like you were saying that you hear the musicality of Comedians you admire in your voice that like when you're doing five minutes or or 10, it's extremely difficult, isn't it? To become robust enough with that. But here I guess you get to really explore what you are authentically in a kind of a long safe form, especially 10 minutes.

Speaker 1:          02:56:28       That's those, those little short sets you do it. So those are just, you know, me, you can get a bid out or a series of funny things that you can say, but as far as like any real depth and part of what comes out that's really funny is like if you watch someone like Jim, part of like what his comedy is like, you'll understand after you see him for 15 or 20 minutes, this is how he makes fun of things. This is his personality. So you kind of get his vibe and then another subject comes up and you're laughing before he even starts talking about it because you're kind of following where he's going to take this. Yeah. You've signed up to. I'll enjoy this now. Yeah. You're tuned into his perspective. Kinison was a huge influence. Yeah. I loved Kennison.

Speaker 4:          02:57:11       He was the hands down and he was revolutionary. It was like seeing Metallica for the first time. Like what would lead the way these people reacting? I never saw a, uh, an audience of comedy audience. He made them. He made them almost want to go in a marsh pit and to, to. No, I don't think Carlin would dance around being Catholic and and kind of expose things but not. I mean Kennison comes out and he just in a biblical way, I thought it. My mom tried to make me go to church and it made me a good person. I learned more about biblical to and just how common sense wise listening to him. He made me think about it. He come out and yet Jesus was never married. No wife is going to buy the and he'd go into this whole thing about he leaves on a Fridays with 10 of his friends.

Speaker 4:          02:58:06       His wife has passed. Know where's the, where's all those losers that call themselves disciples? Everyone that says I believe, I believe we put up feed. I had sat down with hopefully do the common sense of this is why doesn't anyone talk about the common sense of this? He just put it balls out there. He can get away with it because he was a preacher and he knew the Bible. He knew everything about it and he would sit there and he comes home on Monday, looks like shit is dirt all over his face and he sees his cross out on the lawn and she's like way Mr as well. Another one I was dad decomposer. I'm in the spiritual world. I got to get back a sheet. I don't know where I began, and then he went on this whole thing about, oh, they doctored this whole last supper.

Speaker 4:          02:58:57       Jesus me, am I gonna am I gonna betray you? And he'd say, Oh, sock my dad, you know, fuck you. I will say drink of this blood. And just the common, just he may, he dumbed it down to an made me really think about that one. Yeah. This is also, like we said about Metallica, the force of his delivery. Yes. Unprecedented. And no one had yelled out punchlines before. The way he did it. He married? Yeah. You were married and I hung back to you. Good. Remember this face. No one, no one came at you like that, but it was. It was more than shtick. It was freaking hilarious and it made a lot of sense whenever, whatever. Who did talk about the devil, the devil coming down teaching you. It was, it was sick. I remember her talking about, well, you said becoming famous because you're fucking heart is you finished your show. He trying to stay marriage. It comes up in Australia. No, ever. No. Two fingers in your as and me and my friends are, well, fuck, fuck you to your can even fog and breath in. Then he'd go home to your wife. No one will ever know or like, uh, you know, uh, you know, I've married, she's on her period and we're going, we're in the middle of a really difficult time, but thank you. Thanks.

Speaker 4:          03:00:20       Yeah, he's, he's a real wild man. He was like, he introduced rock and roll sensibilities to cry. That's what I was attracted to. That whole rock, crazy loud energy. Well, he was also so different than everything else at the time, which was like the roll your sleeves up, you know? Did she ever notice, you know, ever noticed how come when you get a cup of coffee? There were no, there was this sort of observational comedy boom back then and he came along, which is roaring monster. His first bit ever on tv ever I think was the African, which was huge here, like you please help these poor children help these children

Speaker 2:          03:01:00       and he comes out and he's gone and I'm sick and tired of seeing these commercials when I try to make you feel guilty. You're sitting there watching how can you sit there and your air condition heat covered full, a full kind of sick, fuck God. Give him a dollar and then he goes into the whole thing. Don't send them another thing. They live in fucking don't send them money. So someone like me going to go there. I've come here, we came here 500 miles and we realized we wouldn't have to travel this far. People

Speaker 5:          03:01:36       taste it, but it's going to be 100 years from now. Fucking sand deserts in America too, which is don't live in hall. Chad's got the drive

Speaker 2:          03:01:53       and what was one of the best examples of like, people always like, this is a fucking trend now, but good comedy should always punch up a comedy shows, punch out bullshit. Bullshit, bullshit. Nonsense. Comedy should be comedy. It's just like rap music or fucking gangster movies. It's indecipherable. You cannot decide what's funny, what's not funny, and that is one of the best examples of it. That African bit, Ugh, huge change. My like he. It's simple. It's funny, it's a real, it's a real topic. And I actually sat there and thought it went, why don't, why are they living in a fucking desert? A retarded, like what's, why can't they move? This is stupid. I don't get this. Why don't you help them? You're right next to him. Don't feed them yet,

Speaker 5:          03:02:37       right?

Speaker 2:          03:02:38       Goddamn blanket. It's not ready yet. We skied is such a great bit and again, a great bit if it. If someone did it in 2016, but in the 84 revolutionary yeah, 85 maybe. Maybe it'd be fucking revolutionary.

Speaker 3:          03:03:00       It's releasing you from the sanctimony. There's two. So much sanctum into your way down and you know, able to have an authentic reaction. There's so much of yourself that you are oppressing and it takes him and you see that again through tend to architects conversation. We add that there. Trickster, the role of the tricks that I like that comes up in native American meth is like a coyote or the rave and or they say that like even Christ is a tricks there in moments in the bottle of these people that I am, that's not reality anymore, other than that's a tricks the function to go like, you know, you know that there's a prescribed way that you're supposed to respond to that, uh, African commercial. Well look, there's this alternative way of responding to it and to present it comedically, so freed me. You freed me from reality is like an unchanging.

Speaker 2:          03:03:48       And you know what's interesting about him? Did you ever read his brother's book? Brother Sam. His brother wrote a great book of Mine, Sam, and one of the things that he said is Sam's like emergence of who he is. He came out of a car accident. He got hit by a truck when he was a little kid and it changed his personality, radically hit a serious head injury. You got knocked the fuck out and came back fearless, and that's a. that's a common thing. Impulsiveness, fearlessness and rage. These are con, the constant themes that come out of head trauma, so it's interesting like one of the most important figures in the history of standup comedy might have literally been birthed because of trauma, like physical brain trauma that's barely and I never heard the brain damaged pioneer for that head injury. Same would never have been discussed.

Speaker 2:          03:04:40       City was a different person like before that he was like quiet and shy and a normal kid and then Bam, he gets hit by a car, fucked up, put in the hospital. The whole deal comes out of that. He doesn't give a fuck. He just tastes deaths. I don't think that's it. I still think it's a steal because a pretty chat, right? Yeah. Like what the fuck's he doing? Good. I had trauma drew in the moment, but it was. That was how we deliver up Jesus. He had this explosive dynamic delivery and I mean I don't want to attribute all of it to to the head trauma because obviously there was some genius involvement is creativity. You definitely blew my I. I'm. No, no, no, no. It's not. It's not a negative thing. Look, I've. I've dealt with a lot of brain trauma because I know a lot of people that have gotten fucked up from fighting.

Speaker 2:          03:05:30       You know, it's there's a real thing that happens to people and you, you hear about all the time when they do these shows on nfl players who become explosive and they, they get crazy and impulsive and they get very violent and some of that has to do with repeated trauma to the head. Well, just one event, one car accident, one thing like that can literally change your personality because it's a very fragile dynamic of synapses and personality. Neurochemicals. The brain's actual like the flow of chemicals of neurochemistry and the physical body itself and the way your personality manifests itself. All those things are directly connected and an event like what happened to Sam Kennison literally reshaped in art form. Well, about 10 people to get head trauma and suddenly can speak perfect French. Have you seen them on the Internet a lot? Yeah. They knocked over the nuts.

Speaker 2:          03:06:24       Come back with perfect French. It's a common phenomenon and it can be checked out online anytime. Is that true? They get really good at math. They only speak French. Does someone have to teach them from mice with the risk little head trauma. The downside is you've said he might come back to the stream and the aggressive or you might have a headache forever. It's also possible to set a lot easier and quicker. It's much quicker satisfaction and getting them stupid books. I don't have patience for them. Books, foreign accent syndrome. Accent. I'm a rare creatures. Develop appears to

Speaker 1:          03:06:56       be a foreign accent. Chinese teacher stroke. Speaking English. What about that? How about that? But it's the daily mail. They might have just made that up. So we'll click on it right now. Motherfuckers, um, I dunno because I do know we have to end this though. Unfortunately checking for 23 hours and 20 minutes. I don't think I'm going to adjust to the girlfriend. And stuff, and be a normal person. You're going to have to continue to keep doing podcasts. It's four slash 20. What time do we come in here?
