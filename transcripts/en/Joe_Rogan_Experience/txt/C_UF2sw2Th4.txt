Uh, if you are interested in nootropics, I suggest just Google it. Go to go to Google and typing in the word nootropic and aerobic and what they are essentially as nutrients that enhance brain function. And a, there's a lot of interesting studies on them and there's a lot of controversy on him.

Speaker 3:          00:02:05       Hey Joe Rogan podcast by night. Fucked up worries horse though, man.

Speaker 2:          00:02:13       All respect to Roy MacDonald. We need to get a better copy of that recording. We can get one. I'll get one from the UFC. UFC pulled all the youtube videos down with in minutes. Oh, did they really? Yeah. Well Ladies and gentlemen, what is your new book called? Voice of reason you're VIP pass into enlightenment. Voice of reason. The Voice of reason written by this Guy [inaudible] your hair. I'm here. And by the way, on that commercial you just gave, that has gotta be the single greatest guarantee in the history of fair trade. You don't even have to send it back. You just call it your word. You Go, listen man, this isn't working. And they refund it. That's amazing. We had to make it the first 30 pills, cause the way we had it set up was, you know, any order, you don't even have to turn it back.

Speaker 2:          00:02:55       So then people started selling it on Ebay. I'm like, all right, well you can't be that on. Yeah, it's like the IRS is basically, you're counting on honesty. You're counting not, it's for oversight. But I like that. I mean I can tell you from personal experience, I want to do that. I mean, if it didn't work, I want to, I want to lie to keep a couple of pills. And I think honestly, I like it. That's all. I think if you have a product and you believe in it, you would want people to buy it more than once. Especially if it's something like a vitamin supplement. Sure. So I'm just letting them know you're going to like it. It's, it fucking works. It's a fascinating little, uh, you ever get into vitamins, nootropics, anything like that? Yes. Uh, in college and uh, I was sick all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:03:29       I was getting sick three times a month, even if it was for, you know, a day or something. And my mom said, look, you've got to get started on a multivitamin. Do you think this is also because of wrestling? Like you just, I think so. Yeah. You're, you're kind of in a good petri dish for sickness. You're malnourished, your overtrain and you're not getting enough sleep with all the road trips in different time zones. Perfect. Perfect. Petri dish to get ill. And I started in a multivitamin known as centrum complete, which has less nutrients than dog food. That's what my doctor told me. But it worked for me. Those small nutrients made a big difference. So when I realized, Geez, I haven't been sick in a year, then I really started getting involved and now I want some really good stuff. You can't even buy over the counter.

Speaker 2:          00:04:06       You've got to have a doctor ordered a, it's called Husana. It's very powerful. Uh, you know, 4,000 milligrams of vitamin D goes on and on a u s a n, a, Ooh, sauna. Oussama and it's a combination of vitamins. What happens? Yeah, something just happened. Some short, quick blurb. I get it too, but we're back. Um, combination of vitamin A nation of vitamins and minerals and it's, you can't get it in a GNC or so you can't not know. And you know, and again, let me tell you, okay, most vitamins are 10% effective, 90% marketing. We all know that about nutrition, GNC type things. The ones that really work are 10% marketing, 90% goes into the lab and making them. Now that very statement I just gave you may in of itself be the marketing that the people have put out. I don't know, but that's what who's sauna is doing.

Speaker 2:          00:04:55       You can't buy it. You've got to order it. Uh, they don't have enough to mass produce it because it's so potent and effective. But I have had a number of doctors with, with, with extensive reading and say, listen, this is the one. So do you have to, you don't have to have a prescription. You can just order. Probably not. Yeah, but you, you just got to have a doctor's office call up and you know, an 800 a doctor's office has to call them for you when they got to call it in for you. You know, that's something they tried to get going, uh, years back. They tried to label vitamins as nutraceuticals and then you were going to have it so that you needed a prescription to get vitamins, which get, it gets a little weird, you know? I mean, I, I would appreciate a little regulation so we know exactly what the fuck is in everything because right now it's, it's a little wild west when it comes to things like supplements.

Speaker 2:          00:05:38       But I just think that, uh, having to go to a doctor to get some vitamin D, that seems like that's, I don't, I don't want that. Yeah, no, I hear you. But that comes back to my point that it's, you know, 10% effective, 90% marketing. You know, how many things that GNC are made in the same lab, but they're packaged different. Whoever can get the word out more and, and I can tell you, you know, I've tried everything at Gnc on the off chance that something might work. Um, yeah, I begged my dad to take me there when I was 12 years old and whoever the most muscle guy or whoever, the most handsome guy, whatever it was, that that attracts you when, when you're vulnerable at that age. That's what I'm begging. My Dad had put 40 bucks down and buy me the protein drink for, so I fall forward.

Speaker 2:          00:06:18       I mean, people, people always fall for it, so, you know, yeah, they don't have oversight. It's, it's trial and error, but what's not. Yeah. Yeah. What isn't, it is, it is kinda crazy. But there, there were a few things that actually did work, but they got rid of him very quickly. There was one called Mag 10 and it was Sunday. They used to have to go into that little glass cabinet with the key to open it up. You couldn't even get it out of the regular video game, right? Yeah. You got to let them know like you want it some porn, I mean, I mean that's your porn was testosterone pills and mag 10 was fucking real. They got rid of it really quick. You would take an absurd amount of pills. I think it was like 10 pills. There were these clear pills, but you would tell you, I don't know, who knows what kind of fucking damage did your liver, but oh my God.

Speaker 2:          00:07:00       You'd feel like a fucking raging animal. Yeah. Oh, okay. Great. Wow. Yeah. I gained a lot of muscle on it, man. I gained like 10 pounds of muscle on it and like eight weeks and it was legal. You could buy at a GNC, you could do like six to eight week cycles on it and it was such a steroid. It was so obvious because as soon as I got off at my Dick would just crash, my body would crash. I was like, wow. I was like, wow, this stuff, even though it's something you buy at Gnc, essentially it's just like doing a steroid. Sure. So, so essentially they discovered something that the government had it yet and had a man and they got it. And you know that's going on. There's a drug out there right now, and I shouldn't call it a drug because it's not, but it's, it's a natural product, a known as Kratom.

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       I don't know if you've heard about this, but it is absolutely an opiate. It's absolutely a painkiller. And you know those drive through espresso places that they've got, we've got a place like that in Oregon and the guy sells kratom and he makes 150 grand a year and it's completely legal. The government has not caught on that. This is a painkiller. I mean you get a high, you get a low, you've got to crash. I got a buddy that's coming off of painkillers. He got, he got addicted to the Vicodin and what he's doing is he's going to buy in this Kratom for $10 a pill. He buys five, it cost him $50 he goes every Sunday and when he shows up at 10:00 AM Joe, there's a line waiting for this stuff. It's a drug, but it hasn't been found illegal yet. And I'm saying that because the story you just told about being able to buy a steroid over the counter, people are going to think that's not believable.

Speaker 2:          00:08:28       That happens all the time. The government just hasn't caught on yet. Well, they don't know that they should. Well, I don't, I think going to be able to like when balco came out with that clear stuff that declare, you know, clear, right? Yeah. It was like somehow or another they're undetectable. You know how many more of those or possibly out there. I mean, how hard is it to do something like that? Sure. Well I wouldn't know, but from what I've told, and I read about this stuff all the time, is that if you simply get yourself good chemist, he goes, any changes, one molecule, one element, and all of a sudden the strand is something else. You've got your band list, you change one molecule, it doesn't fall into that category. They're looking for things in that category and they pass, you know, it's Olympic year and we see this.

Speaker 2:          00:09:10       Every games where an entire country comes out looking different than every other athlete, the whole country looks different. You're like, okay guys, you're all looked at that. That way. This whole team has gotten this much stronger and more shredded and times of picked in everything from track to pull Volta to, to swim. Everybody's better from your country. What are you doing? And that the 10 years later you find out and it gets added to the banned list. It gets really creepy when you start thinking about shit like cycling and you see all these dudes getting convicted and all these dudes turning on. I had a friend who was a professional cycler and he told me everybody was on crazy shit. She said, they all are. I said, there's no way you can compete at that level when you're talking cycling as a professional site. Sure.

Speaker 2:          00:09:54       And I'm thinking, well, you're talking about, you know, shooting up on and off of a regulation. Okay. So we're talking, we're talking cycling like the WWE or any, any high level cycling, Lance Armstrong type toward the front. Shit like you, you almost have to be on something to repeat. Yeah. You know, it's, it's getting really weird when it comes to those types of shirts and what about when a guy gets caught and so then instead of just going, yeah, listen, I've got to take my medicine, he got to bring everybody else down with, he becomes the tattle and you know, you know, come on, what's happening here Jose? Because that's the way it works. She got brought down, you got [inaudible] going to take your medicine by Jose can Cincos uh, that whole book and Publishing and telling how it was really going down. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:10:35       That really cost him people's love. Sure. Like for his whole life. Yeah. I, that guy, if you ever read his Twitter, this is not comfortable. Right. And I never have, wow, he's got some dark shit in there, you know? But what it was like, what he had money and now that he's got nothing, he knows what people are really like and you know, it's, it's pretty dark and it all, a lot of it. The hate that this guy gets emanates in the fact that he ratted out his friends. Sure. I think there's something to that, you know? I really do. I mean I even as a kid, nobody likes a tattletale. Nobody likes though. He was telling the truth. Yeah, I did see a lot of stuff that he did with his book and I did find it to be pretty genuine. I tend to believe a lot of people go, oh, he's an admitted cheater.

Speaker 2:          00:11:14       How can you believe it was like, man, thanks for being pretty candid right now. I do believe him. Well when we start seeing guys like Mark Mcguire's shrink down right after he's done playing, you know, and then admit that he was on steroids or you see Barry bonds and how big he got. And then it's almost like, man, how, how much regulation do we really need of the human body? You know, what does w what, what the fuck is wrong with what Barry Bonds did? What he took something that made them stronger. You know, it wouldn't, it shouldn't we be interested in stuff that makes you stronger. It makes you healthier. When you look at a guy like Barry bonds, like that guy, he looks like he was 30 years old. They got better when he was older, you know, as a, as a professional baseball player.

Speaker 2:          00:11:52       That's amazing. It shouldn't that be something that we would like look into and say that's a good thing. You know, don't you want Roger Clemens to keep throwing fucking heat deep into his forties like why would you want to stop that? Sure. But don't mix the argument. I mean, of course we love medicine and advancements and that's wonderful, but if you're talking about rules within a sport and you want to just keep it out for whatever reason, but if that is the decision that we're going to keep it out, well then the guy can't bring it in and cheat and lie about it. I think that was the debate. But I hear what you're saying. I mean, if it is making people healthier and better than good for them, and by all means, we should advance knowledge and technology in that area. But that doesn't mean that it's okay for sport that's up to the governing bodies.

Speaker 2:          00:12:32       Right. But I mean, that's what's going on in California. They just, um, recently ruled on testosterone replacement surgery, or excuse me, a testosterone replacement therapy and, uh, also a medical marijuana and they ruled positive on both those things. Sure. And if you're, you're doing testosterone replacement and you know, that, isn't that essentially the same thing? And it's essentially the same thing as, uh, doing, uh, you know, human growth hormone or anything or anything along those lines. They're doing something to stop the aging process. You're doing something to enhance the hormonal balance of your body. Well, it's been deemed legal then, so it shouldn't be an issue. Right. Well, look, if it's legal or illegal is where it all comes into play. You know, I, I can tell you I went through this in California and they're acting as though they're just made it legal. That's not true.

Speaker 2:          00:13:15       It's always been legal here. Uh, their, their commissioners. Did it always recognize it. You know, I went through this in California with a, what was the official designation that they recently just bestowed on? It would, it would allow a disclosure process here, let, let me talk about myself because I was such an expert on this cause I had to go through it. I go out, I tell him I'm on testosterone. I say, can I compete in your state while on testosterone? And that's what you gotta do. You gotta get permission? Yes, go ahead. So I do it. I take my tests, they coming back and they say, hey, you're on testosterone. Well guys, you didn't need a urine test. I told you that well in advance in writing. And you told me I could be on testosterone. They go, well we don't, we don't like this, but you made the rules and you told me I could do it.

Speaker 2:          00:13:54       So it just ended up in this really weird area where they said, okay, but you didn't disclose it properly. And they started changing. The argument just got really weird too where we could never narrow him down. So they finally come to some resolution within their own body and you know, in the state of California, and I don't want to turn on throw stones at them. I want to be pretty diplomatic with them, but look, they are not transparent. And for you and I to two experts and authorities in this sport to still not be completely clear on what their ruling was, I think speaks to their lack of transparency. And if they don't want people to keep stubbing their and breaking rules, just make it clear so that we know what the rules are. It seems like they're dipping their feet in the water. To me, they constantly do that so that they can then pull back out and go, that's not what we said. Yeah, it seems tough. It seems weird. Well, I mean they're in a tough position too. It's a pretty thankless job to be the head of an athletic commission and there's very few guys that do it and do it really well. But um, you know, it's not an easy job trying to figure out what's fair, trying to figure out what the playing field is. Especially a science

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       and medicine advances. You know, I liked the idea of a guy like Roger Clemens being able to play baseball because he's taking, taking human growth hormone and doing testosterone. It doesn't bother me. Like it's really sucks that this guy that he can't actually just say that he can't just do that. Especially in a sport like baseball where I mean what, what, how's it going to hurt somebody? I mean even if he is enhanced, it's, he's not going to hurt somebody. That's where it gets weird like an MMA. That's like the weird, we're the real questions in MMA. It's like, I mean if you really have something in your body that makes you like hyper human, you have like hyper human levels, which people can do if they, you know, if they use testosterone replacement or something else on ethics.

Speaker 2:          00:15:35       Sure. You know, I'll tell you Joe, one thing I admire about you, you are oddly comfortable in your own skin. You know, you'd have no problem admitting anything and being a real open book and, and, and, and so I think that's one reason why you can't relate to Roger Clemens is cause a, you know, you're like, look, this is who I am and this is what I do. But that's a very rare trait. You possess that. But not a lot of people do. Everybody's got their secrets not to necessarily on this topic, but another things of their life where they keep it private. I think this is your rare, this is a weird thing where yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:16:02       you know, his sport does not allow you to do that to your body, but I think it's a silly argument when you're looking at a guy who's an older man, like he is your like, how else do you expect him to be able to do that?

Speaker 2:          00:16:14       Do you know anything about the, how the body ages? Because guess what, a certain point in time his body doesn't recover enough anymore. He can't throw the heat, but now he can. He can because he takes this stuff. Isn't that stuff. It doesn't that mean it's like good for you, isn't it? I'm like good for him. Like shouldn't he be looking at it that way so that it's such a weird fucking narrow band of like what is, what is cheating? You know, what is, what is legal? What do we allow? Well it's going to be a certain point in time. Are they going to start genetic engineering and what do you, what, what is everybody going to do? There's going to be a fucking pill that take and it turns you into Thor. You know, what are you going to do? Are you going to not take it?

Speaker 2:          00:16:51       Why would you not want to be like a superhero? If I could give you a pill and it lets you fucking fly through the air and become bulletproof, you wouldn't take it. Of course he would take it. It would be amazing. No, I like your argument. You know, and again, it's Olympic year. Olympics are my favorite sport. I don't watch professional sports, but I love every four year was when the games come around. So you might hear me reference that a few times today. But you know, listen, the athletes used to be done at 23 years old. That was 23 was it? If you made 2121, that's usually no, you know, look at the last games in Beijing. We had Dara Torres who was 40 years old. We're going to have 40 year old athletes on our Olympic team this year vying for metals. And that's a tremendous compliment to medicine.

Speaker 2:          00:17:28       That's a tremendous compliment to technology and what we're discovering here in America and abroad. And then not label it, don't label it as drugs or label it as cheating. Look at the fucking advancement. Look at what, what could, what's happened. Sure. Well, and it's real interesting, you know, because the only time you're in hot water as if it's a banned list, but you know, that's junk science and it changes constantly. Things that weren't our legal, that are legal aren't legal, you know, in testosterone replacement. Boy that's just got such a, a bullseye on it, but there's a number of performance enhancing, uh, agents that are perfectly legal and a, you know, you've got to still be within your limits. Caffeine comes to mind. As a matter of fact, you know, you want your caffeine levels as high as you can get prior to competition in my opinion.

Speaker 2:          00:18:10       You know, I can tell you for my body that's when I do my best. But you still gotta be within the law and there's a lot of things like that. What's the legal limit? Is like a cup of coffee. Yeah. Essentially, you know, if you're in a poor compared to no dose, which is something you can buy at a local convenience store, you can take two of them. Is that how you do it? Do you regulate it that way? That's how I rate just cause there's no problems. If you do that, it stays in your system about four hours. You'll get it within that, but you're fine. But coffee can vary wildly. It absolutely canyon. And there there's people that say, and I'll listen to it and they'll block you an athlete. A lot of fans don't know this. When you go in the locker room, you cannot have anything other than a closed bottle of water.

Speaker 2:          00:18:45       They want to see you open it and the reason they're just trying to protect you. If you go in there with a coffee and I'll bring in there five hours before your fight, you come in there with some kind of a drink. It could have something that you don't know about. But you know, I mean the caffeine caffeine is just one that I mentioned, but there's a number of performance enhancing things. And if a guy takes the time and get surrounded with the right people that look into that, cause often it's overlooked. But you know, supplements, diet, vitamins, as we talked about earlier, these are, this is a very important element. And have a guy inundates himself and finds where his level should be and he's legal. Then he's legal good for him. And so many people want to point a finger and say there's something wrong, bad.

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       But there's not. And the science continually change continually junk science. You can't get, you bring five doctors in your jail, you get five different opinions. And you know what? It's also assuming that nature's fair, which I think is ridiculous. There are some people that are fucking incredible genetics and there's some people that literally can't compete with them. Absolutely can't. They just physically can't compete with them. You, we both know guys who have been non athletes that have tried to wrestle or tried to and they just couldn't do it. There's guys that are born with freak bodies. You know, there's, there's guys that are without a doubt, they're gifted genetically. You know what I mean? That's, that's not fair either. You know, it should we round people up by genetically, you know, how, what's their disposition should we, I mean cause if you really want to look at it like what's fair?

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       Sure. Like it is not fair that, you know, you can get a guy like what's his name? Jonah Hill. Yeah. Right. And a guy like Melvin man of exactly. Jon Jones. There's no way you can tell me that those dudes have the the same hand. Sure. Someone, someone got fucked. Yeah. Yeah. The guy and the guy that you want to win is whoever worked the hardest show. The most dedication has the best skills and that is a fallacy. Some guys will be born with a better skillset than other guys will be able to learn over a lifetime. They just are, you know, you see it with speed, you see it, what the ability to jump you see, and it's just a natural thing. There's some guys that will take testosterone and still have a lower level than a guy that was just gifted with it and you see it all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:20:53       So I get your point. Yeah. It's not a fair playing field and the ideas that your mind can allow you to overcompensate or to overcome the disparaging genetics. You know, your mind and strategy is important. Just as important as being physical. But that's always assuming that big strong people are dumb. And guess what? A lot of them aren't sure. A lot of those big, strong, naturally gifted motherfuckers are also really quick and they think quick. You know, I mean, look at a guy like Mike Tyson. People would always talk about how, you know, Mike Tyson wasn't bright. My Mike Tyson was a fucking boxing historian and maybe he wasn't educated, but he figured out the best style for his body. He figured out how to, how to break a man down. He figured out how to put up a pace that other guys just couldn't deal with and if you could just punch faster and everybody else could that no one could fuck with them.

Speaker 2:          00:21:42       He, he figured all that. That's, that's there's a intelligence to that to get excellent at anything requires an intelligence. That's what's really scary about a gin genetically gifted guy versus they could easily be really smart. Bert sugar just touched on that same topic with Mike Tyson and he said, he is very smart. He goes, I'm not saying he's intelligent, I'm calling him smart. He's very smart and I don't personally know what the distinction is that he was getting at. I think it meant, you know, some of the bad decisions that, that, that Tyson made around tech. Have you seen Tyson, by the way? The show, you know, he's doing this spirit of I heard it's amazing. Do you know anything about it? I have. No, nothing gets up and tell stories. I got to tell you one story. So let me set the scene real fast.

Speaker 2:          00:22:19       Dana white went and saw this. Dana got invited and Mike or Buddy, so Dana, you know, he's backstage, she's having a great time. All it is is Mike Tyson goes out, he's got a microphone. He tells stories of his life and they've got to production. So if he says, you know, Don King and a story, boom, don king's face pops up behind them on a big movie screen. So he's telling this story and he's to brings up the Robin givens era where you know where he's beaten Robin givens and he's doing these horrible things to her and he's going, listen, the one thing Robin never told anyone is that I was seeing her the whole time, you know, the whole time we were still seeing each other. Now he didn't use the word scene. I'm sure you can fill in the blank, but he's seen her the whole time.

Speaker 2:          00:22:54       So he says, you know, one morning at 1:00 AM I drive over to Robin givens house, my mansion that I bought her that I'm not allowed to go to. And I'm ringing the doorbell. And this isn't all that uncommon cause I do this a lot except today she doesn't come to the door. So he says, I'm walking around the house, I'm looking in the windows. About 15 minutes later I see her pulling up the driveway in a Bentley that I bought her that I'm not allowed to drive. So she's driving my car, she's coming to my mansion. It's one in the morning. She gets out of the car, she brought someone home with her. So she brought a guy home to see her into my mansion in my car that I'm not allowed to be at. And when the guy gets out of the car, do you want to know who it is? And on the screen up pop's Brad Pitt. He was a waiter and she picked him up that night. His before he ever made it into the movies. So Brad Pitt sitting there going, hey man, hey buddy. You know I don't really know much about, I know who you

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       are. We joke we were going to watch some TV man and my Tyson says I could kill you right now. And nobody would. And uh, Tyson walked away. Then he did the right thing, got this car and he walked away. But how great is that story? That's a great story. Shit, Brad Pitt, but he gets somewhere, his production crew found an old picture of Brad Pitt. You know, some of them are out there where he's in the chicken suit somewhere in la trying to make it. It was one of those old school pictures before he ever got his break. Robyn brought him home to Mike Tyson's house. Terrifying. That must have been Jesus k, man. Let's be cool, man. Isn't it

Speaker 6:          00:24:24       [inaudible] that someone can get married to someone? Just marry someone really rich for a couple of years and you can just get fucking paid. You can just get fucking paid. If a girl can do that, a girl can meet a guy like Mike Tyson truck. I'm getting Merriam, manipulate them. Ropa man. Ride it for a few years and then just hurried

Speaker 5:          00:24:45       the rewards and in this era of reality TV, we all know when that's happening. It's just the guy does like do this. Chris Humphrey really think he was in a real relationship. I mean, God bless him. I hate to see that he got his heartbreak, but I'm watching it from my couch on a biweekly basis when the girlfriend's forcing me, I'm like, Chris, this isn't an actual romance man. This isn't how this works. Do you really think you're getting married to Kim here? I think he thought it was real. The whole rest of the world's going, you gotta be kidding me? Well, he would say insulting shit to her

Speaker 6:          00:25:15       that you should never take from a meat. You know, he said something and I, I was on a soup with Joel Mchale, that's his name. Oh yeah. Funny, funny guy, but very funny guy. And he's got this, um, uh, the sketch they're doing about Kim Kardashian and Chris Humphreys. He said, why would you care? You know, he said something, they're like on the air, like, why would you care in a few years from now, no one's going to care about you anymore anyway. Oh, you know. Yeah. And everybody clapped and we laughed and I cried for fake, for TV, but for real life. I look at it and I go, well man, could you imagine saying that to your friend the way it can't move? That would be to say to your friend, if my friend said that to me, I'd be like, bitch, what the fuck am I doing hanging around with you?

Speaker 6:          00:25:57       I would cut that guy out of my life instantly cause I'm not capable of saying something like that. To a friend and that's accurate, mean spirited, but it might not even be accurate, but who the fuck would have figured out that you'd be able to do what she's doing right now? That girls making $60 million, whatever, a year. I mean, it's incredible how you with what he's going to see that the, that she's not gonna be able to figure out how to ride the tide. Maybe she can, maybe she can stupid. She already dead. Sure. Look what she did. I mean, it's, look, she's no genius, but there is genius in what she's done. This genius in making a living by just being a person. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:26:30       Slowly. It's very rare. I mean, you see it all the time. A America always has to have somebody. It's usually some famous blonde. She pulled it off as a, as a Brunette. You know, she was at your Pam Anderson's, you're Marilyn Monroe's.

Speaker 6:          00:26:41       Well she also pulled it off with them. Fuck table. The

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       black dude. Yeah. Very powerful. I've heard that. Get out of here. You heard. I don't know much about that, but I, well speaking of Ya, and it wasn't the gentleman involved, but you know, Reggie Bush was at the last, UFC was kind of, Bush has my car supporting him. Right. The second he's literally in your car. I sold my Barracuda and the owner that a, I sold it to sold to Reggie Bush. Well that sounds like that's his car. You, you do know how the sale works. Well, it was my car should say, I should have phrased it better. I apology you got me. Uh, he, I had a 1970 barracuda or wish them luck with that fucking thing. We need to be clear. You've got to, you've got a lot of tough guys as friends and I see Reggie Bush rolling around that common, I go take it back and honor you.

Speaker 2:          00:27:26       But now that I know it's okay. It was a fair sale and he's got the title then. Not only that, it was Easter Bush hands with him and I would change hands with him. Yeah, he was, uh, he was dating Kim Cardiac. And I know this. Why do I know this? I have no, not who the president of Poland is. I've no idea. But yet I know who Kim Kardashian was dating before she married this other fellow and I'm doing my best to act like I barely watch that show. But yeah, I knew I didn't know it too. I guess I should be ashamed as well. Well you are so good at promoting a online and, and promoting and interviews. Have you ever thought about doing some sort of a limited version of a reality show? Not too intrusive. I never had, I appreciate the compliment. No, I never have.

Speaker 2:          00:28:04       You know, reality TV is still pretty new and does some generations they don't know that. Um, I, you know, I like it. I'm a big Fan, but uh, you know, I got asked to do the ultimate fighter, our reality show in our, in our industry and I just passed it. Just want to coach, you know, I love coaching. I coach a kid. See what I didn't want to do is go to Vegas for five weeks and now with the new format of live every Friday night on FX there. It's a 13 week process. That's what Dominic and your I are going through. That's a long time. It's a long time. You know the little thing, chunks of your soul in that place. For example, I have a dog. I can't bring them to, what am I going to put them in Vegas? Is Dana going to get me a yard somewhere?

Speaker 2:          00:28:44       You know, it's kind of too much to ask of any, but I can't go 13 weeks without the little guy. He'd forget. Why was the smartest dog? That's cute. What kind of dogs are cute? It is. Please say poodle. I love the, I love dog. He's a rescue dog. He's a terrier. He's, he's a a mix. I actually don't know what completely is. He's a cute dog is what he is. Three years, so you wouldn't, I mean you could get a place you could rent a place with a yard. I guarantee you he's probably some fancy schmancy high roller gambler type dude. That would love to rent his house out to chill son and for a couple months. All right, well well there you go. Then maybe I will coach the reality show after all you've saved. That would be fun to watch. I'll tell you that. Yeah, I appreciate that. I think there's some, you know, I think that show picks up the one problem I have with the show because there was some reality TV I like for example, big brother I got pretty into, there was this crazy guy in their name will for one season if you ever wash it. I'm not seeing any nods. I'm assuming nobody said he was fantastic.

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       It's absolutely fantastic cause he'd go into the dark room and he would just tell the truth. You know, I'm, I'm going to tell this girl this and I'm going to stab her in the back on Friday and I have not even in Cleveland, the bloody mass, you know, it was, it was, he would say these crazy things and then he would do it and then he won the whole show. At any rate, the problem the ultimate fighter has is they put them in teams, but there is no team. And so, you know, they'll go have a, uh, the team will do a fight and if your team wins, you need to win something. You know, on the apprentice with Donald Trump, if your team wins, boom, you get a night out to dinner, you know, or whatever it is. Are you going to go meet with this guy?

Speaker 5:          00:30:14       You all get some money. There's no team concept. Why am I cheering for my opponent? I want whoever the toughest guy is. Well, there's a my team or their team to lose and then I want the next toughest guy to lose. I am in this to win this for myself. And it's really important that those guys start to get that. Uh, and so they either need to do with the team concept or they need to have a team reward. So there's a reason you would cheer for one side or the other at this point. There's no point.

Speaker 1:          00:30:38       So they just, just camaraderie for the sake of camaraderie.

Speaker 5:          00:30:41       Right. And then as, as the numbers dwindle down, now all of a sudden, hey, you were on this guy's team, now you over here. And they mix it up and I'm a supporter of our show. The last thing I'm trying to do is, is put down the show. But I mean from a critical standpoint, I'd like to see a reason to cheer for a specific team or just don't even put them in.

Speaker 1:          00:30:56       It's just fun because the guy who's the coach, I mean especially this one right now it's going on with Uriah and Dominick Cruz. What I like about is they're constantly talking shit to each other and it's just another way to try to win. Just another way to try to win with a team. You know? And people love to be a part of teams, man, they like to pick team window. So No, I'm on team mapple you know, people love that. I'm a, I only get droids, I'm sure I liked a droid platform. You know, people love to be on teams for soccer, but I hear the ice cream sandwiches, the share. Actually I saw, have you seen the, what is it? The note? Yeah. It's amazing how easy that is. Like this big, I love it. How much you want to urinate? Chell son in jail, son is healthy.

Speaker 1:          00:31:33       That motherfucker drinks water. Drink a gallon a day. I'm sure Mike Dolce by what? By the way. Just texted me. Yeah, go right down there to the left. Mike Dolce who's a fitness expert who was a former fighter and a professional bodybuilder I think at one point in time where power lift or something like that. Super Smart Dude when it comes to nutrition. So he's going to come on the podcast and I'm going to have your diet straightened down. Canyon mine. I need to address a certain issues with you. We're going to get you on all vegetables from now on and uh, and do some animals last night, which he, I had foie gras and and s for the only, for a couple more weeks in California. I know, but this place I went to, it was called animal and I highly recommend it's in Hollywood and it's just kind of all every single crazy, they had veal brains. They had, they had, you know, pig slice, pig head. I don't even know what that is. My uncle, he used to cook lamb brains. He used to cook it on the grill with brains taste. It doesn't seem like a good idea. He brands, right. I was okay. It was a really inexpensive, you know, it was, it's like peasant food. It was peasant food and then it becomes

Speaker 6:          00:32:40       slowly, it became like sort of chic, you know, fascinating that you're eating organs and brains and stuff like that. But uh, it wasn't the, it's not the best tasting stuff, but fog wise, that's amazing. Come here, take the her right before it's about to get band. Yeah. I took Brian to this place, nor that's right down the street. And they have a, they have a full law there for only two more weeks. This mother, he's silly pitches. You silly liberals. What have you done? You got rid of the best tasting food. You're going to kill the doc that do you really care if someone overstuffed this doc before you kill it? The you even watched the videos. They ever see them. Oh, force feed a doc. They take the dock, they stick. It's stupid head under this faucet. They pour some grain down its throat and then they pull it off.

Speaker 6:          00:33:22       It takes five seconds and you think that that's terrible. That's terrible to an animal that you're going to kill and eat. Really it's, it takes five, 10 seconds is not screaming in pain. It's, it's for a human. It would totally suck to have of food shoved down your throat, but they have a completely different capacity, like absorbed grains and stuff. I mean it makes their, their liver swell up. It's like it's not good for them, but it makes delicious food. Is there a humane way to do it? Like is there five or 10 seconds a day if that, you know, it's quick, really quick, man. I've watched him do it. It's ridiculous. They take the thing, the the, this is what we do. We grab him by the neck and you'd stick its mouth on it and they get sort of used to it after awhile.

Speaker 6:          00:34:00       They just, they just kind of like stat there that they pump grain down their throat and then they let them go and then they're done for the rest of the day. They wander around eventually they gonna fucking kill them. I mean that's why they raised him. I mean he'd say, what are we going to slowly regulate that away? I mean it's not, this is not real cruelty. Veal to me is far more cruel and legal and I'm more attached to veal because it's a mammal. I don't give a fuck about ducks. You know, if you'd take a duck and you stick it in there and you fill it full of grain. I don't feel bad. I don't ducks. I don't really like them. I'm not like a fan of docs. I don't know how to fail at any birds. I don't, I don't really feel like any affection for birds, but animals I do.

Speaker 6:          00:34:37       So we can do that for a little baby cows and bend them up and feed him milk and keeping the dark and they never get to move around. Legal fills a tough thing and I'm a, I really like veal, but if you see how that's tough, it is tough. After that, once you, once you know, you know, I tend to agree with where you're at because I'm from the country, I'm from far. I see. And I see this stuff all the time. People are just trying to get by and support their families, but I am surprised to see you take that stance. I'm very impressed by that. I didn't know you had an open mind. I thought you were. You were narrowed in. I've misread GI Joe. What did you think? I was like narrowly hippie style. Very liberal. I heard that you moved to Colorado at one point. What's Joe doing there? That's a, I told him I don't really, Oh, you know, that's where I really learned to not like hippies when I lived in boulder. The, that's when the reality of the hippie truly set in. You know? It's like if you're, if you're around hippies, it least seven out of 10 of them are not going to have their shit together. Sure. Seven out of 10 of them are always going to need to borrow sugar and you know, send out a 10 and

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       park. Their car breaks down. They need to borrow yours. They're just, they just can't quite fucking get it together. Well, you know, the, the ECO movements, a tough movement because if you go all the way with that, if you go all in, you've got to start killing people. You're anti human, right? Because the humans, the only thing that hurts the environment, the craziest parasite of all time, right? We're sucking all the fish out of the ocean. They say within like a hundred or something years, it'd be no more wild fish in the ocean. I mean, it's incredible. So we're sucking all this and then we're throwing all our trash in there. So this is gigantic, like island of floating plastic as big as Texas in the middle of the Pacific. And it gets bigger every day. Mean we're crazy. If you look at us from like if you were an alien species and you were observing earth, you believe it.

Speaker 2:          00:36:21       We at this one thing just fucking everything up. Wow. Yeah, for sure. If you really want it to go eco, you'd have to start killing people. You'd have to shut down power. Everybody gets a bike either at you take a bike there or that's it and hopefully you don't get stuck somewhere north. He didn't build your stupid house somewhere where it fucking phrases in the winter. Cause if you did well, guess what? That's just where you are. That's where you're going to be walking around now. And I hope your food supply last I hope is plenty of animals around you. You've got to make sure you keep them coming because you know you don't have cars anymore. Stupid cars are bad for the environment. I'm glad that you recognize that though. It'd be, you know, cause I hear this Eco Freako talk all the time. It's like, you know, be real careful because you're anti human.

Speaker 2:          00:37:01       If you know, if you want to go all the way with that and most topics that you get passionate about, you know, I've got this one that chain himself to a tree to stop construction, gets pretty whack on. It's like, you know, make sure what you recognize you're turning on us and choosing us over a plant that, you know, make, make sure that you at least acknowledge that. Yeah. Well I, you know, my issue that I've always had with uh, like people who are not just vegetarians and vegans but are really kind of aggressive about it and the way they fuck with you. Sure. You know, you know, hey man, I just want you to reconsider. I just want you to think about what you're doing. You're killing life too stupid. I fucking love plants. They're beautiful and gorgeous and you have to kill acres of them every year just to keep your stupid fucking fat face alive.

Speaker 2:          00:37:43       All right. That's an animal that's rather, that's a life form that is light your eating life, you're eating plant life. You know, you can't get by without eating the life, right? Life eats life, period. So shut the fuck up. I got a chapter in my book on this very topic about cutting down trees and it's like, listen, the older and bigger the tree, the better with me. If you're going to cut it down, you know, let it go, let it make some sunlight and let a couple of new trees pop up. But you know, that's the way that it works. And we use those trees and we build our houses and paper and then it's a, it's an absolute necessity, but those are here for us, not the other way around. And uh, you know, you hear these Eco Freekeh is, you know, of course they only come out when CNN or some local camera crew is there. It's often about them not about the environment. And that's where a real frustration comes in. But I hear what you're saying. You know, in fact, we were talking about Kardashians a minute ago. Somebody just recently threw flour or something on her over in England and yeah, she's pressing

Speaker 6:          00:38:36       charges, you know, it's like, hey, there's other ways to do it. You know, one of the, anything you do needs to be nonviolent. If there's anything we learned from Gandhi or Martin Luther King, it's, you don't come around using violence to get your attention. And that's where the Unabomber went off course when people were a spraying people's fur coats with red paint. Sure. You know, I mean, come on man. Now you now, yeah, you assaulted someone and this very thing, one of the resources of that animal's body is now you. You fucked it up and I ruined it. And people quit listening to your argument. What you do that list I'm out. They listened to your argument and you have made that animal's death really kind of worthless now because they're going to have to throw this coat away cause you, you spray paint in it like a fucking asshole and it's, it's ridiculous point.

Speaker 6:          00:39:20       Now they're going to have to go get another one to replace that one. So, right. The punishment becomes the crime. I get it. While the whole thing is stupid, it's stupid to try to enforce your opinions so, so aggressively with paint, you know, that's a salt. You're a, you're a fucking asshole. You'd been asked no matter what side of the argument you were on. Sure. You pick the side and you went full asshole with that argument. Well, you, uh, you know, you run out and try to assault Ted Nugent. You know, it's like that kind of Shit, you know, it's like, oh, he likes to shoot animals. Well, why don't you go down to the fucking one, go down to the butcher, go, go down in that place where a thousand cows a day, I have to stick their head into a metal trap and a fucking pissed and slams through their head.

Speaker 6:          00:39:57       Go after them. Go, go. What are you saying? You know, you're saying that we should, every animal that's ever lived, she just live forever and take over the earth. This is stupid, right? You got to eat some of them. It's the food chain. It's natural selection. There's no, there's no way around it. And unless you want wild predators roaming around, keeping them populations down, you're going to have to fucking kill them. So few people understand that. They say they don't understand how important hunting is for population control. They don't understand how important it is for traffic safety. Sure. The people who don't live in rural areas don't. I drove home once, I had a Gig in western Massachusetts and I was living in New York and you have to drive down, I forget the name of the Turnpike, but I had to go 2030 miles an hour cause deer would just tart in front of the car in front of the car.

Speaker 6:          00:40:39       I mean, it was an infestation. I mean, I've never seen anything like it since. I might've seen two, 300 deer and a knife driving down this road. It losing incredible. Maybe I'm exaggerating. Let's say 50 deal. Let's say 20 dear. If I saw 20 beer, I'd be shocked. So a lot of fucking cheer. I saw them all over three dear. Most people can't relate to that. You know, and that's where our votes come from is the city. And it's like, man, you've got to listen to these folks in the country that are dealing with these actual things. Those things can fuck your car up, man. Real dangerous. People die all the time. This are fucking wild video. Recent one of a kid who's on a motorcycle, he's going to 80 plus miles an hour and he hits a deer and somehow or another he hits it perfect.

Speaker 6:          00:41:19       Dead on so he doesn't even lose control of the bike. He just went boom and the raw, he pulls his bike over and his friend comes over. He's like, do you go to died? You could have died. Did you just see what that, he goes back and the deer is just cut in half and you know, he literally like the deer exploded on impact. That is amazing. I have not seen that as absolutely. I mean I'm glad. Pretty wild. I thought that's what you're going to say. No, I don't want to even waiver. I mean, he didn't even lose control. It was like, like he was, if I ever lost narrowed by, I didn't have like a saw. You're saying basically and at 80 fucking miles an hour, he's the one time speeding. Saves a motorcyclist and Iraq. Yeah, no kidding. Yeah, that'd be interesting to talk to.

Speaker 6:          00:41:59       Talk to a physicist and he was slowed down. What would have happened? What have we not cut it in half? It would have been him. I Dunno, we'll because he hasn't like 80 miles and I was like, oh bullet. You know, just being to run right into that just probably just exploded. Well, but the kid lived and there was another video of a guy and it's another helmet cam. Same thing. And another one where a guy on a motorcycle hits the, a a deer, but he loses the bike and he was in, it was, he was wearing like full leathers with pads, like racing shit where they have like a, those really hard plates in the money. And he got up and he was fine. And uh, you know, and it was like telling people, look, this is the reason why you need to wear all this shit. Cause something like this can happen and this just saved my life. Sure. But it's a you, oh that's a video. It's about 30 seconds.

Speaker 7:          00:42:45       Zen when he hits the deer. Wow. See that was, that was it. Oh you're kidding me. No back it up a little. Wow. He does keep control of that bike. Yeah. Well he, he's a good fucking rider till you could totally tell because he didn't lose it at all. He's a bad motherfucker. Cause when that deer hits him, he has a little jiggly moments. He that and see that little Gigli moment going 80 fucking miles an hour he hit to do it. This is the Admin, the flats. Well,

Speaker 6:          00:43:11       people, uh, I mean, did this go viral? That people probably know what we're talking about here. A lot of people know about this. Like I got a bunch of tweets about it and so then his friend comes running over and they go back to see and it's just splattered. Well, I assure him glad that guys okay. That, that would not have been pleasant. I love bikes, but I can't do that. I can't fuck with crashing. No. You know, there's something about riding on something that like, no, I see that you see the deer. I took, uh, my, uh, safety lessons and I was ready to get a bike and I saw one accident and two friends saw to two other accidents in the course of like three days involving a bike. Wow. Yeah. What of them? Someone like on a phone hit a car or hit a bike?

Speaker 6:          00:43:52       Just fucking nailed. It wasn't even paying attention. Guy Goes flying off the bike. Another one I'm a friend of mine was riding through the canyons. He hit some, some salt or some, you know, gravel or whatever the fuck it was. Lost his bike, ripped his shoulder apart. And then, uh, it was actually right around the same time that Frank Mir got hit too when frank got hit by a car and broke his femur femur. It was like on his honeymoon. I think it wasn't real. I ain't go on his honeymoon vacation. I know he's on vacation. He was on his honeymoon. Pretty sure it was in Vegas than it. It wasn't really. See, I thought it was, I thought it was overseas. Like The Bahamas. I might be, I might just be adding that element. I used to be a historian. Joe, you used to not need to consult and Internet if you had me around I think.

Speaker 6:          00:44:28       And now they're about so many shows. I've, I've lost track thinking about Tito Ortiz. Tito Ortiz was in Jamaica and he got hit by a bus. Yeah. Him and his wife on vacation. That's what happened to frank. Got that frank was hit by a bus on a motorcycle. No, no, no. Tito and his, uh, his, I think it was his, his wife or a, they were hit by a bus when I think he was on like a moped or some shit. That's why price hurt. That happens, man. There's only so much data. Sure. Holding your brain after awhile. Those, those stories get little Squirrley. Yeah, no. Frank was hit, I think, like right in Vegas. And uh, some guy just fucking ran a red light, slammed right into him and broke his back, broke his thei, sent him flying through the air and it took a long time for him to come back.

Speaker 6:          00:45:13       You know, he's a really impressive case of a comeback. Yeah. You know, he's gone well because he didn't go real smooth, you know, smooth it all. You look at like the branded verified, they paid it pano fight, you know, it's like wow. Like where, what happened to the, you know, the, the former champ, right. What happened to the dynamic frank Mir that burst onto the scene? You know, they're the one that beat Pete Williams. Just that crazy barbecue guard I remember, you know, frankly it was a beast and so that, that set him back. Man, I was a pretty pretty grueling injury. He's one of my favorite guys. I really like carrying smart guy. I enjoy frank [inaudible] is his wife's real nice. You know, he's a local Vegas guy. He's a great commentator, Second Amendment Guy. He's very good. Common tastes better than the interviews that he cuts.

Speaker 6:          00:45:54       Some days he does an interview on and people are turned off by him. They think he's putting out an attitude or, so I don't see it, but I read and hear about these things, but he doesn't do any of that. He's totally different persona when he's commentating. And I like that. You know, if he doesn't, if he doesn't see it, he doesn't say it. He's pretty fair. He's a smart dude and he's a very smart dude. He's a kindle with them all the time. Was Kinda guys constantly read it. I've had some really heavy conversations with Frank Mir and you know, that's why he's so good at Jujitsu. He's got so much technique too because he's like, you know, he's like an encyclopedia for Shit. The fact that he caught Noguera and that Kamora and broke his arm, did Jujitsu world just exploded when that happened, that Frank Mir not only did it, he did it when Nogueira instigated the ground game because he hadn't, Frank Mir hurt and he wanted to finish him off when that just shows you what a bad motherfucker Frank Mir is.

Speaker 6:          00:46:40       That's crazy that he bested Nogueira on the ground and finish while while dizzy. I mean that's, if that guy's not underrated. Damn. That's really fucking impressed. Oh, he's got his positions for sure. You and I was cheering for frank in that fight. I was happy to see him when you know as a fan. But I took no pleasure of seeing though Garrett injured at all like that. That was a, that was a rough one. That was a really hard one to watch, but Noguera's back, somebody told me no gear is booked for a card coming up. Book for card coming up against check Congo. Yeah, against Chicago. So he shook it off, you know, get the Nogueira. I don't care. I don't know how. Wow, that's amazing. I mean, how the fuck did, I don't know what they did to use plates or one, I don't know how they put it back together again. That was fast, but good for them and mirror. He's going to go fight for the world title against those Santos who I will never underestimate again. I under, I thought dos Santos was dead in the water with, I thought it was

Speaker 5:          00:47:29       a waste of a fight. I couldn't believe. I will never underestimate dos Santos again.

Speaker 6:          00:47:34       He can throw heat, man. He can throw heat, you know? And I was really looking forward to him against Allister. Oh, starring him would've been a very interesting fight, man. You know, because Alister such a pure standup guy and Allister is so good at incorporating leg kicks and knees and he's got a real tight guard, especially now that he's so big, you know, like, like Kinda like sure hunches, everything over a protects himself. Well, he's a dangerous guy to anybody that has to, it has to enforce a standup strategy if you want to just go and box with that guy. He's got so many other tools other than just boxing, you know, and he's so technical with his attacks. It's just a, it's socks that he, uh, you know, whatever his issue was. He's saying, I think that he got some medication that some doctor gave him the head testosterone and then he didn't realize it and it fucked up his testosterone to epitestosterone. I don't know what happened. I don't know the story behind it, but I guess he's suspended for like nine months now. Something along those lines.

Speaker 5:          00:48:28       That was interesting. Now that whole case was interesting and yeah, they all, let's jump off that topic as quick as we can. But you know, one thing about that, he took a substance test. He took for two of them were surprised test no substance was ever found and he came forward later, I kind of volunteered head. It looks like I might have taken some testosterone, but that wasn't what the test show. The test didn't show anything. It just said, hey, there's something with your TD ratio. Let's try to figure out why this happened. The media really got paused wrong. Well, here's what you got. Understand Joe, so I'm really glad you asked this. Here's your t and d. Okay, here's your fee. Here's your, he says Mastro's for folks at home, strong epic test. They're very close. You know they're usually even one to one.

Speaker 5:          00:49:05       Some allow commissions allow four to one or even a six to one difference, but the reality is most are one to one. Now if your testosterone went up or if it went down, that gap is your ratio with the same set. If you're Epi, testosterone went up or went down. That gap is your ratio. That's why it's a very disingenuous test. So when a guy has a TDE that's elevated, the media immediately assumed that he took his tea. Could have been in the gutter. His epi was at the norm and that guy, he could have been unhealthfully low. Now I understand that, that, oh, designate. There's no distinction. It's extremely disingenuous. You will never find an endocrinologist, not one in this country. Literally. This is a challenge. You won't find one no matter how disgruntled, you won't find one to come on and tell you that it's a, it's anything other than a disingenuous test for testosterone and these commissions are missing this left and right really, and it's, it's absolutely horrible.

Speaker 5:          00:50:03       You know, in some commissions they'll, they give you just enough rope to hang yourself. They say, listen, you're allowed, go ahead, take testosterone, but make sure you're within the levels. It's like, no, wait a minute. That's not how it works. There's a testosterone level. You need to figure it out through taking blood. Well, we can't afford that. Well, you can't tell a guy he can take testosterone, but he can't elevate it. Financial issues as far as accuracy of test, you have to understand this. Alister was 14 to one a guy could be 100 to one and still be within the legal limits. A TDE ratio does not pertain to anything and you won't find one expert now, and I didn't say a doctor and it said to, I said, an endocrinologist not one expert to tell you differently. Real. It's absolute junk science and they can't.

Speaker 5:          00:50:48       It's only your in recognition that does this. It throws off your TV. Well, his tea could have been up at, he could have been down his, he could have vote. You can be dealt with. Listen, a guy has every right to manipulate his testosterone every right. The question is how did he manipulate it? Did he use a legal substance or an illegal substance and Alistair's test for them too that were surprised, showed no substance was found. Now I understand if you want to, if you and I is for me right here we were. We're just two guys talking. We can share our opinion. But if you're a medium member, if you sit behind a desk, you wear the suit, you collect a paycheck at the end of the night, your your brand in an analyst by your affiliated network, you can't come out and say that he took testosterone when the test and it showed that he was never even accused of that. And you know from Mark Cuban's tax write off that nobody watches, those guys could have to miss the boat anymore. They took pleasure in coming out an outing him for something that the commission ever accused about. ESPN missed the boat. Everybody got this wrong. And they were quick to say that all he's taking tests, well not according to the test and [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:51:50       net it was, I don't think it was anyone other than boss who was a boss, was pretty sure that he,

Speaker 5:          00:51:56       you know, and he, and he's got his own thing, you know, boss it with golden glory is very loyal to Golden Glory, which I really admire with him. But man, don't let that crossover. If you're behind that desk, you got to tell a story the way it happened and they didn't it,

Speaker 4:          00:52:10       it's hard. You know, it's hard. I, I have, uh, I've done commentary before for friends and they didn't like what I said, you know, and then he got mad at me and I would go, listen man, I have to say what I see and if I see you, you do, you're doing something and then you get caught doing that. It's because, I mean I have to say it, I have to tell people what to look for. That's what commentary is. I can't pretend that something different is happening so that you feel better about it when you listen to it. But then the million people hear it or not getting an accurate account of what's going on.

Speaker 5:          00:52:40       I talked to, we had this conversation, Joe in a bar, you and I in Boston and, and you, you told me a line and I've stolen it. I've used it all the time cause it's very accurate where you simply said, if you don't see it, you can't say it. You can't go out and trying to hype a fight, go, this guy's standup looks great. If it doesn't, if it standup, look shotty, willing to stand up, look shot, it's not your job to try to cover for him as an analyst and a, I've taken that with me and now I'm behind a desk and the suit and I took that one line and I've educated other people to just simply what that one line, if you don't see it, don't say it. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:53:13       Yeah. You have to let people know what your real opinion of it is while being respectful and that's where people don't understand. Like just, you know, if I'm accurate about something, it's not disrespectful, it's just, it's just uncomfortable. Yeah. It might be

Speaker 6:          00:53:25       uncomfortable for you, but to label a disrespectful, you're not saying what I'm saying. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with you as a human. I'm saying, you know, when you, you, you know, you might do a technique wrong, you might, you might have an opening, you might, it's not a disrespectful thing, but you know, to a lot of fighters, like it's a, your entire identity is wrapped up in, in what you do. But you owe that to the viewer. That's who's paying to hear you, not the fighter. You know, I can tell you I thought I beat Michael Bisping. I thought it was pretty clear. It's very close. You had a different opinion and I never sent you a text or was upset with it. You, you, you have your opinion and when you're on the mic, it's your job to share that opinion, you know, um, my opinion, but I should clarify that my opinion actually changed when I watched it again when I watched it again.

Speaker 6:          00:54:12       I, uh, I thought your takedowns what a want it. Yeah. I appreciate, I, you know, I had it the same way and I'm pretty objective. I'm not afraid to go look, I pulled one out. I shouldn't hard though. When you're watching it live, you know, quite honestly I, I honestly get a better view of fights a lot of times from watching it at home. The experience of watching on paper you is fucking great. I mean they always get to the right angle immediately. It's never like, you know, sometimes I'll look up and you know, a herb Dean's right in front of me. I can't see what's going on or someone's in a post. I don't, I don't know what's going on in the box. Like when, uh, Alan Belcher and who some are, Paul Harris went at it the, when they first went to the ground, I didn't know that Belcher, he instigated that position from the shot.

Speaker 6:          00:54:52       You know, he's the one that pulled him into the, into that position and I didn't realize it. I thought that Paul Harris was diving on them cause I couldn't quite see what was going on. So you do sometimes get a better view of a fight from watching it at home. Yeah, sometimes you get hyped up in the moment too. It's hard to and off topic. But speaking of Belcher, you know, Dana gives a fight of the night fight of the night easily was Alan Belcher. You know, Pell Horse is scary. He's flat out scary. Nobody wants to fight him because if it doesn't go well, you're going to sit out for six to eight months. He's going to rip your list. Yeah. It can go really, really bad. For the folks who don't know anything about of UFC or Jujitsu and you're just listening to this podcast, Paul Harris is uh, one of the weirdest, uh, like specialists in all of the UFC because all we, his number one thing is ripping guys knees apart.

Speaker 6:          00:55:39       It's terrifying. Weird build weird technique. Hulk looking dude. Yeah, sure. I've ate and just built like a brick shit house and just dives on your leg and very set apart how horrific the way he wins. People are screaming in agony. Yeah. And you know, Alan, when I got Allen did a great job, I was happy for him. See the fire pell Horace went to, because you know, if his backstory, everything he's overcoming, he's a great story too. But I'm a huge fan of technique and Paul Jarvis is techniques not just as physical strength. His technique is masterful the way he laces up leg locks on guys. The way he hit my Senscio. I mean the way he lays his him up, it's like it's so pure, there's no fat in that technique. You know, I'm a fan of of that, but I'm also a fan of a guy like Alan Belcher just figures out how to deal with it. I love, I love that he just

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       works specifically with guys like Dean lister and instead of saying, well we want to avoid this. He was like, fuck this. I'll go to the ground with this guy. I don't care. I'll go to the ground with them. And I think he blew his mind by doing that. I think par is mine. Yeah, he blew mine when he started going for the twist her. I was like, if he taps Paul horror is, this would be the craziest fucking thing I've ever seen. Yeah, he, cause he talked about that in his interviews leading up. I'll go to the ground, I'll put him in an ankle lock. I was like, sure how many guys say? And then he went out and did it. I mean, he didn't go for the ankle lock, but he went out and did it. He backed up what he said good for Belcher.

Speaker 2:          00:56:52       You know, Belcher said moments, why watch them and go, you are amazing. And on a bad night he's still very good, but on a good night, that guy's amazing. Good for belter. Yeah. And He's had some tough times, you know with is a detached retina you had for awhile, which is very scary know to imagine. I mean you're a professional fighter and you start to lose your vision because of fighting, so they have to repair your eyeball and then you know, you have to have the confidence and the courage to go back out there and keep throwing leather and letting people punch you in that surgically repaired eyeball. So he was off for a long time. I mean, you know how hard you have to work to make up that ground. Of those six months you lost. Now you got another four before you got to work. Double Time.

Speaker 2:          00:57:32       Triple time. It's, it's incredible. Just to catch up. How long does it take just to catch up? Happy to see Belcher doing well? Yeah. Oh yeah. It takes, just to get back, just to get word and not no improvement in technique. No improvement and conditioning. Just to dreading catch up. How long does it take to develop the wind for a five round fight till like for real, like you're rematch with Anderson Silva that you're, you're training for. How long are you in like peak ridiculous hard training to, to gear up for a five round fight? You know, the answer I give because it's Mike is a lifetime. It's a lifetime. I, I worked so hard, you know, till I was 23 and finished wrestlin to go six minutes and it was so difficult to go six minutes at that pace of a wrestling match. Now you know, now 15 months.

Speaker 2:          00:58:15       Oh my goodness. It's so hard when you start to break into those 25 minutes. I don't know if the human being is meant to do that. You know, Saint Pierre keeps taking a lot of criticism. Well, the reality is you're asking him to do a monumental task, which is to go hard for 25 minutes. It's, it's an impossible task to ask somebody. And there's a saying in boxing that if you go for the knockout, you will not win a decision and you need to make your choice. Now, if I go for the kill, you know Dan Henderson Style and you don't get it, and then you realize that show guns still alive and you got to hang out for 25 it's not going to be afraid 25 minutes. You know, you're crazy. Fight that. Yeah, you gotta pace. And a lot of people go, well Dan Henderson's not in shape.

Speaker 2:          00:58:55       Well that's not the case. Dan Henderson's a human being and human beings get very tired when they go for the kill. So you've got a planet, right? And George does planet right now. If you want to see an exciting fight, shorten the rounds and George will go crazy. I guarantee it. He did before. So you think it's just a matter of the human body has to work too hard to fight at a high clip for five rounds, you know, 25 minutes. It's just too much. There's no nobody sprints for 25 minutes. How would you have it? Would you have it? I always felt like it's kind of interesting. There's two, two schools of thought. One of them is that MMA is more difficult than than boxing and maybe the round should be in shorter length, but then the other school of thought is, but it takes her a grappler a long time to get his opponent down to work so hard for a takedown and then only have like five seconds left on the clock.

Speaker 2:          00:59:41       That sounds, that's ridiculous. You need, you know, a five round at a five minute round. At least you take a guy down within the first couple of minutes, you have time to work, you hold them down, you, you finish them, you know you have time to work. I hear you. But you know, the competitor is a no sports set the rules, it's the fans. It's an audience that sets the rule. So it comes down to meet if you are a fan as well, you want a fan as well. So if you as a fan, I mean taking yourself out of the equation, what do you, when you just subjectively with all the knowledge that you have, what would you think would be the better format? Well, it is how I would answer you. Professional boxing is viewed to be very boring. So they call boxing, very born on boxing.

Speaker 2:          01:00:15       So born well that's not true. Boxing is fantastic. Go Watch the amateurs. It's three three minute rounds. They throw punches in flurries nonstop for nine minutes. So boxing is very pleasing. Professional boxing where you're asking a guy to do 12 rounds at three minutes, 36 minutes is on pleasing. Know commentators have developed this feeling out process. There is no such thing. It's a unwritten agreement. You and I are going to go box. You and I both know we can't go 36 minutes, so I'm going to stand around and move around a little bit. You're going to stand around and move around a little bit. Once we get to round five now we both can do seven rounds. Let's go ahead and fight. There is no such thing as a feeling out process in boxing. I boxed for years. There's such a thing as surviving a ridiculous time frame that's put on you have a half of an hour and so if you have a guy hurt but he's got a good Chin and you go for it, you're fucked.

Speaker 2:          01:01:06       You're screwed. I mean that is the same. That doesn't mean you're not going to find exceptions to the rule. But yeah, the basic belief in boxing, and I believe it too, if you go for the finish, you will not win a decision. Eddie Alvarez does that name ring a bell. He's over in Balter. Eddie Alvarez talks about this, you know, you've got five rounds, you gotta fight, how are you going to do it? And he says, I don't train for five rounds. I trained for two and Eddie Alvarez was like 32 and two we had an amazing record. Any finished guy after guy, but he also had a totally different approach. I'm going to go for the kill. If I don't get it. Yeah, I acknowledge I'm in trouble. It's pretty 32 men that didn't have an answer for it and I really, I really liked when Eddie said this, he and I were in Bodog together and I heard him say that that, oh, that's hyperbole.

Speaker 2:          01:01:44       And I started wanting to know he's serious. He trains to sprint and finish you and he does guy after guy and when it doesn't work well he's got problems. Melvin Manhoef I heard you bring him up earlier. You know Melville do the same thing. He's trained for three minutes, three minutes of fury. Well that's one of the things, the reasons I love a k one I love watching high level kickboxing's three rounds, no big matches or three rounds. You know, I mean I, I used to love watching those three round k one fights because it's about all those guys could take the way they were going at it, the clip that they were fighting at. I mean if you go back and watch like Jerome Le Banner versus Peter Arts, they're just fucking

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       swinging at each other and they take turns knocking each other down air. It's knocks down the banner with a high kick and then the banner starches IRTs with a, with a left hook. Both guys that just got fucking waylaid on each other. They, they kick like you'd swing a baseball bat. I mean it's just violent. You know, he's speaking to the k one at guys that did well, what's up with Bob Sapp now these aren't real fights he's going to do in these countries, right? Is the opponent and on the gang, like this guy that hits and master the bell for five seconds, he'll push and ask is a gentleman, he's a sports. He's going to punch somebody after the bell and less than the back. You worked it out. Hey, let me cover up in the act. Mad about it. I mean, come on. That whole thing looks so fucking lazy.

Speaker 5:          01:02:55       That couldn't be real. Bob Sat kits a paycheck. I mean, this is my opinion, but it doesn't look good. The whole thing was bad. And I think what made it worse was when Pooja now's he kept hitting them after the bell. Like, come on, put your not going to do that unless you know this looks, this looks awful. It's like when Dan Severn and in Shannon rich did their, uh, their work. You know, Dan, come on man, you're caught on this. This is brutal. This is brutal. And your interviews after the fact are worse than the poor job you did in the ring at fuller. Pc. That fine. Oh, you didn't see it. Do you know how to round off is from gymnastics? It's a, gymnastics is a handspring and you'll use it to Dan Severn hit one of those in the fight. I'll just let you know that Shannon did something damn separate, hits a round off in the middle of the ring and he stumps.

Speaker 5:          01:03:40       Oh God, it was so bad, Joe. He was silly. And then after the match, they do their interviews and their interview, Jane Dan Severance cover up of the work was worse than the work is. Well, I was just fortunate to get over on Shannon rich. He's such a great competitor. You know, Shanna Richie was never want to fight. Dan Severn, who was a former multiple time world champion, you know, absolutely legendary in our sport. I was just fortunate to have a good enough training camp to go, wow. And you got to stop, man. You got to stop. We've all been in the locker room is Shanna. Rich walks in and says, who wants the night off? All Right Shannon, I guess I'll take it. You know, this isn't a secret in the industry. Dan quit, you know, come on, you got caught. Just call it what it is. Wow. That's weird.

Speaker 5:          01:04:22       Well, he always did a lot of pro wrestling as well, didn't it? Horribly. I mean, he got a stent in the WWE. They just couldn't use them. They said, look, you got to go. Just not entertaining. You know, he just didn't get it. He couldn't, he couldn't work. You know, if you watch a Shannon match and you see how bad he did at PR, it was so bad. Man. It was so bad. This was the brilliance of pride. You know, and, and I get heat when I talk about Vandelay and cro cop doing their fake matches. But in America, if you're going to do a pro wrestling match, both guys will sit in the back and they'll come up with what they're going to do. They call it their spots. Okay, you do this, then I'll do that. In pride, what they would do is the promoter would visit one locker room.

Speaker 5:          01:05:03       So if you're going to take on Vandelay or cro cop, you know your promoter shows up, boom, here's your 10 grand and here's how this fight's going to end. Vandelay isn't privy to that. So when the guy goes down, his celebration is genuine because he doesn't know that the guy got his locker room visit. It's the same thing with cro cop that thought one leg cemetery in one lake hospital, no cro cop. Your legs aren't knocking people out. The promoter visited the back beforehand. That's what's not going to. And then I made this public, I added these guys cause I don't like either one of them was ordered to do word. Absolutely. Some legit knockouts for sure. For sure. And Cro cop the, the second part where he kicked his head. Yeah, I remember that fight. I enjoyed their first fight to win. Vandelay one, I think they call it a draw and draw Vandelay one, you know, per our scoring system, you know, but as soon as I said also good ridge and coal and all these guys coming in, yeah, he's right. There's a bunch of payoff. Well, there had to be Takotna again. I mean, come on. You don't have to do the cotton and Coleman. They'd have to put on your Colombel rain jacket to figure this out. You know? Excuse me. Excuse me. How come I am 22 and oh in Japan and can't win to straightened America.

Speaker 5:          01:06:10       Eddie Bravo. Bravo got offered by a name

Speaker 1:          01:06:14       to lose or to twin rather. Oh. To uh, to beat to Coro. They were going to have it set up. So, but meanwhile it could have been a double cross where he goes there and he thinks to Coro is going to lay down

Speaker 5:          01:06:24       Carl Beats Shit. That's what we call the screw job. Finished jet. The Montreal screw job.

Speaker 1:          01:06:31       Yeah, there's a word for it in a professional pool too. I think it's a double dump. They get dumped both ways.

Speaker 5:          01:06:37       Ah, I see. Is that what it is?

Speaker 1:          01:06:39       Yeah, because pool has a real hard problem with that. Let guy like say if I, uh, if I'm a pool player and you're a rich guy, I said, listen, shall I got a fucking game and I can't go wrong here buddy. I am, I am robbing this guy. Come on, let's put up 500 bucks. So let's make some money. And uh, I go to him and I go, listen, let's, here's the deal I'm going to lose and we'll just fucking split this 70, 30, and cut it up right now. And we've got ourselves a big chunk of cash and so there's no real match going on in the first place. Sure. They had already decided that they're going to dump and they were going to split up this guy's money. That's him and a friend and got together and they pretended to be rivals so they could gamble and he would dump to this guy.

Speaker 1:          01:07:16       I can't fucking make a ball and I know what's going on. Surely just gossip. Typical digs, town hustle sharing. You know, the two of them get together after this show and split up half his money or 70%, whatever they, you know, agreed upon different guys from different deals. But it, uh, it was always a, a big problem to the point where they had a, the only time Vegas allowed them to gamble and pool ever. They, uh, they set it up. So it was one of the big tournament's and all they did was make the found who was the number one guy most least likely to what 40 to one odds. Okay, we're all going to let that guy when we're going to just get to gamble all of our money and fucking

Speaker 5:          01:07:50       pay. Right. Allegedly alleged. Well, that's unfortunate that happened. I mean, I can see where that would happen. That is unfortunate because in, in, in some weird walk of society that is sport that does involve timing and accuracy and training. So it's unfortunate when guys what it is yet. But I think I get it. I mean, I, I guess I understand that. I can understand.

Speaker 1:          01:08:08       I can understand betting on yourself. I can understand if you're some wild motherfucker like Bernard Hopkins, he says, I'm going to go bet $100 a hundred dollars on myself,

Speaker 6:          01:08:16       you know, because that's how much I know I'm going to win this fight. I liked that. I don't like the option of doing it the other way. Betting on your pending on your mommy and taking a dive. That's possible. You know the fact that you could get your friend to do it. The fact that there have been unethical dumps before without a doubt. No doubt about it. I mean, we all know of him. I don't know if you've ever been

Speaker 5:          01:08:38       better on a UFC fight, but I don't know if you, if you have it then you wouldn't know this, but the way it worked, you know, in a lot of gambling halls you would imagine, well, if I show up, it's four to one odds and I put 50 grand down, I got 50 grand in 41 it doesn't work that way. If you go to bed at a sports book in Vegas on a UFC fan, this isn't the same for for everything, but for UFC because there's not enough money coming in. You can only bet x amount at a time. Then they reset the line and then you've got to bed it again. I went in and bed on, well I bet on Henderson when he fought Vandelay. Now this was a number of years, I think 2006 could have been 2007 and they only let me bet 500 Henderson was a three to one underdogs. I go 500 505 and I, you know, I got to my $3,000 limit and I had to go to three different casinos. Now I'm quite sure with the influx of the sport that it'd be closer to 10,000 but I'm quite sure it's not over 10

Speaker 6:          01:09:25       how confident were you though? That's pretty fucking bad ass. Just going to casino casinos. The header says it was good

Speaker 5:          01:09:32       and you know, that's what vanity, I mean nobody could meet van. He had that reputation like Mike Tyson was, was hanging onto for a while. You know, but you're talking about Dan Henderson, you're talking about one of the baddest dudes to ever live. He's a fucking tank. He's something else, man. And I knew it was going to be a good fight too. I didn't know was going to be walking in the park. But uh, you got to bet on you

Speaker 6:          01:09:48       guy. Yeah, well you know, Henderson is a fucking tank man. He's a tank. He's one of those dudes were you pat them on the back and it feels like there's something wrong. Why? Why are you so dense? Right? Like what the fuck is this? And he turns around to look at y'all stim or Limu. His teeth are out. Hey, what are you doing? You know, gives you some insult of some sort. That's his way of saying something mean spirited. Knock that last for some reason it's charming when he does it. That's how I saw him. He goes, did you get another fucking tattoo? I got you sound like my mom. He always, he always is something mean as his greedy you. This is my favorite Dan Henderson story. We were in Caroline's comedy club in New York and there's this guy that was, and he wouldn't shut the fuck up.

Speaker 6:          01:10:31       And I go, listen man, if you don't shut the fuck up, I don't want to have Dan Henderson and come over here and hold you down while he fucks your girlfriend. The crowd goes nuts. And Dan goes, why would I hold them down when I could just stare him down? I'm telling you the fucking place erupted. The fucking place erupted. And it was like one of the creepiest things I ever heard a man say to another man ever. Like you can see the dude, the dude just wanted to crawl out of the room and just hide somewhere. The feeling of looking over it, that fucking savage after he just says something like that too, and you're like, oh, let me change. Let me get Outta here.

Speaker 5:          01:11:10       Well, in Henderson broke etiquette, you know there's an etiquette men, if one

Speaker 6:          01:11:13       guys what the girl at one guy's, not you, you're, you're always wrong. You let him slit you let him look like a hero, you know? Then it comes back to you someday. Well, I think in that situation it was, there was 350 fucking people in that crowd. That guy was a jackass. He was drunk. Dan Henderson was there and he was like, well, I'll shut this fucking dummy up, so I like it. It's a pss. Yeah, essentially like a trumped my heckler comment, like I had shut them down and then Henderson came along and put the nuclear bomb on top of it. Right. You put the age, but the verbal age Bonolo each borrower. That's good work by Dan. It was very good work on the spot like that. The best line you could have ever written. Sure. I can't write anything creepy than that. Why would I hold him down when I could just stare him?

Speaker 6:          01:11:54       Now that's a guy has to think like that in order to have that thought in his head in order to be able to say that verbally. I mean, if you're going to be a writer and you're going to come up with that, it might take you six hours alone doing cocaine and drinking coffee to pretend you're the type of guy that would think that way to have that line come out of your character's mouth. Took Dan Henderson one half of one second. He just waited. Well this is the same guy that volunteered to fight dos Santos three weeks ago to move up arguably two weekly. You know, cause truly he's, he's a middle way. He chooses to fight at light heavyweight. He doesn't like cutting weight. Right? It's a truly be going up to way anyway. And he's great and he's fucking, he's an animal. This is not the, and those guys, they almost all come from wrestling.

Speaker 6:          01:12:39       The guys like that Henderson stock. There's, there's guys that can push through pain and then there's wrestlers. There's like, there's another level of, of mental strength of the ability to endure. And when you were talking about going through when you were a kid, like being malnourished and fucking, you know, traveling on buses and wherever the hell you're going to these different wrestling meets to sleep and not getting enough sleep and how difficult and you had to do schoolwork as well or how difficult all that is that the, the mental toughness that wrestlers develop from that ridiculous first of all, from fucking cutting weight all the time just to be able to, people like to feel good when they compete. They like to feel great and charged up and confident. I had so many friends when I was a wrestling that would be like, there was this kid named Mark Collins who is a really good wrestler, really, really good, but he would, he would cut down to like 118 pounds.

Speaker 6:          01:13:27       He was a little guy anyway, but he would cut down like re maybe I'm exaggerating, maybe was like one 20 something years. We were in high school. It used to be one 18 they used to be, but the fucking guy was never happy. He would always just have this dour look in his face. Life sucked. He was just walking around is always hungry and you know, it's it stunted. My friend, Steve's growth, my friend Steve, all of his brothers like six foot two, six foot one six foot, big fucking guys. He's five six because all throughout high school just fucking dieting, shy, going through regular wrestling and then going off to camps and never, never allowed to like actually eat full meals for a normal long period of time and grow like a normal man. It's like he essentially grew up impoverished. Right. You know? Yeah. And

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       it's tough. You know, you're talking about how hard the weight cut is. And for us, for our sport of MMA, it's a 24 hour wait. I mean you weigh in, the show starts 24 hours later in wrestling. It's a one hour weigh in. And not only that, Joe, the national tournament, the whole reason you wrestle is a three day tournament with three ins. So you weigh in, you do two matches, you cut weight that night, you weigh in again, you do two matches, you cut weight that night, you come back for the championship. So, ah, yeah. So I mean you're talking guys that aren't sleeping and they're just, they're just, they're cut weight nonstop, boom time to wrestle. I mean it had, you know, how do you do it? And it really is where the rubber meets the road. Sometimes the best wrestler off that had the best season 35 and will not even place at the national tournament because you know where he used to weigh in and have 24 hours get on the mat, he'd want a dual meet tournament style one hour away and you're on the mat next morning. Weigh in again.

Speaker 6:          01:15:03       And so is that like um, indicative of a style of competing like some guys like Frankie Edgar don't cut any weight at all. Other guys is the, is that the case in wrestling as well? Like some guys would try to cut the most amount of weight, but other guys would think that the best way to do was be entirely healthy and just be natural and deal with a guy. Yeah. As larger. Yeah. You see that all the time, you know, and there's some guys that went and they got a little bit more speed. This guy, you know, he's going to come in the ring at two 20. I'm going to come in at two Oh four but I'm going to be a little bit

Speaker 5:          01:15:30       faster than him. And that's where Dan Henderson's made 11. Yeah. Dan Henderson's beat multiple heavyweight world champion and one from a big Nog to a fade or um,

Speaker 6:          01:15:41       here's what those are heavyweights. But he went to use the little bit of speed. Yes, he absolutely did. But that was the rematch. He fought him in a tournament called King of rings. Okay. So that wasn't really MMA. Like you weren't allowed to do certain things like strike on the ground. Right. There was some stuff that was held back and you could strike on the ground. I want to say was open palm, you know, open palm, like definitely no soccer kicks or pride rules. But I mean it was considered, I considered MMA absolutely fuck Gilbert Gilbert I but because when you're on your feet you can do everything. It was something about what the take down. I believe it was an open palm to the head. Isn't that crazy? When you see like go boss route and style Pancrase fights. What a weird fucking hybrid of the two for folks who don't know you were allowed to kick with, you know you have these like boots on that had shin pads on them but you weren't allowed to punch the face.

Speaker 6:          01:16:27       Instead you could slap people full blast and Bas Rutten figured out a way at a pull his hand back way far and when he would throw slop, I don't know, I can't even bend my hand back the way he would do it. And he would essentially be punching you with his palms. Yeah, the palm strike. He got so good at just punching, throwing like punching techniques in the palms. Whereas everybody else had kind of like, they hadn't figured that out yet and they were slapping each other was about a boss as a master. I love to watch of bosses, little fights over there. Some of those were for Gazy to you, but you know some of that paint cray stuff you'd want us to go, no, wait a minute. Come on. No doubt. No doubt. There was definitely some, some fixed fights. It's weird that some guys don't want to admit that, but now I think they should. I think they kind of owe it to history. You know, we, we know that there was a lot

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       of real fights for sure, but there was all, there was no question about it. There was some that are a little funky, you know. But that goes back to the point I made earlier that both guys aren't necessarily in on it in Japan, Cro, cop, those guys really think they want and if you tell them they did it, I mean you're talking about really hurting a guy's feelings where he gets a, you know who get fighting mad a over that and you go, hey listen what fights century history. We'll, we'll, we'll come out and, and show itself for what it is. But you know what? That's really hard because I don't know all those guys name but cro cop fault. One guy that wore a pro wrestling mask, he is a pro wrestler. He wrestles under the name of via a host. Kairos? Yes. A Alberto del Rio is what his name.

Speaker 5:          01:17:47       But of course you already know that. That's what it comes out and says he's very funny guy and he's talked about it a lot. Yeah, they brought me on. I don't even think about it. I got to fight this cro cop. He's officially, he's going to throw a head kick and I got to make it look real. You know, he's talked about cro. Cop would be that you'd be stunned to hear that. I believe. I believe cro cop did not know that these were fake. No, I didn't have that realization when I first outed him. I had it. I, I came to when he responded to that. You know what? He's either an academy award winner. He truly doesn't know. And then you started to hear for some other guys when they go look, he didn't always know the promoter to come to your locker room.

Speaker 5:          01:18:19       So that wrestling guy, when cro cop kicked him though, he really fucking kicked that guy in the head. Yeah, just the guy sort of like just took it. Yeah. And the guys just got to go down in the boom. The referee will eating the referee we led was coming to the man. This could be a deal. Is that the same guy? Wasn't if it was fake, what a fucking great touch. Sure. As the mask. If they had like a little blood pack it there. And what cro cuts slaps it, blood comes out. I mean what a great touch that would be. But you know, you see a kid come and he'd go, okay, this is the one I got paid for. You take it, it could cause a kick. I had a buddy that went down and he was by no means doing a dive, he was just ready to quit.

Speaker 5:          01:18:52       He was just, he just wanted out of there. So you know, in fighters, we'll do this a lot where something's not going right and they got it's time to go home and you know, they'll usually, the rear naked choke is the big one for, Hey, get me out of here. But uh, so my buddy decides that he's going to go down on a, on a fake knockout. So we're in code dog and Costa Rica. Dan, his guy named Dan Stevens to the big viking guy used to fight in the UFC a couple of times. They didn't Christianson, is that what his name was? Anyway, Dan throws the punch. My Buddy Jeremiah goes down, the punch, missed Jeremiah goes down, but the referee, Troy Wa doesn't catch it in time. So now my buddy who's out cold, well Dow Dan Christmas is going to come down for the finish because the ref hasn't caught it.

Speaker 5:          01:19:30       So my buddy who's pretending it has to come back to life. You guys to come back to life to like lay there and go for Tkis. So when you watch on the replay, like wait a minute, I thought you were out called how come when he came it was pretty bad. But you know, you see that stuff all the time and that's not to say the score a sports for Gazy, that's just, that's competition. What you're trying to do, what I'm trying to do when I'm fighting is make the other guy quit. What he does has to do when he's ready to quit is make it look like he got, you know, that's just part of it and nobody wants to talk about that. In fact, one guy did, one guy talked about it in Ohio and the Ohi, I can't think of what his name was, a former UFC fighter. Rashad kicked him in the head. Sean Salomon. That's what his name is. Sean talked about this

Speaker 6:          01:20:08       and this wasn't my night. I gave him an arm and I tapped out and got out of there. He was very keen on there. He got in canopy because they thought he was throwing a fit and he's, and he, but what he was doing was he was letting people into the psyche of an athlete who's breaking, he's breaking and it's an ugly deep secret and we've all done it as athletes, whether it's in practice or in the rain and we're greatly shameful of it. So what he did is he just let people know, look, this is what happened. I broke down mentally the commissioner comes out in and suspends him for it. It's like, well commission obviously you've never competed. We can, we can see that. Yeah. That's ridiculous. That is what exactly what it is. When a guy gives up an arm, he's trying to save himself and just say a little dignity.

Speaker 6:          01:20:47       I got caught. You know, either. Yeah. That's that. That is an issue. The real issue of people regulating athleticism where they don't understand the psychology behind being an athlete, especially a combat athlete. You know, like there was an issue that I had and we'll, we don't name any names here, but it was when you, uh, you, someone had questioned you about you fake tapping against a Polo Phelia a law and you know, and my take on that is to, for you to ask a man what he's thinking right then in the middle of an incredibly emotional situation where he's losing a fight, he knows it's over. He got locked up in it and he's thinking there's got to be a fucking way out of this. There's gotta be a way you want to win so bad you say something that you're ashamed of later. But to say that that thing that you were ashamed of, it you did represents your character or your sensibilities or your honesty, I think is a bit disingenuous to be judged in that moment.

Speaker 6:          01:21:55       And that vulnerable, awful, devastating moment is not right. It's especially for someone who has, when you have competed at a high level for a number of years like you have, it's almost like you could be considered like almost like a slightly crazy person, like your fanaticism for victory. You're your need to compete and excel it, be it. The only way to get really fucking good is you gotta be a little crazy. You just have to be and you've got to want to fucking win. You can't be happy with any, any other result. You cannot be hat or you won't achieve your full potential. And that sometimes equates to people fucking up. It's sometimes equates to breaking. It equates to mental lapses. It equates to a lot of different things. You know, I had to respond to that. I had an uh, a person, again, let's make sure we keep them on name, but he wanted a response to that. I'm going, Geez, you know, if I'm, to be candid with you, if I get tapped out in front of a sold out audience that was aired on live worldwide television, and I then lie about doing it, the only person I'm lying to is myself. You know, that's it. They only if I'm trying to fool, so if I'm in denial, you know, and I, and me, I could be anybody

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       could be chill or it could be, you know, fight her ex. But if he's doing that, if a person, look, Dylan person, you're lying to yourself to the guy, fall up, file a complaint with the commissioner. Well that's within the rules. Uh, you know, you know, what did the guy do if you get, if he's forcing you to make a ruling, go ahead. But you know, to like you said, and let's also not forget one, when you file a complaint, how much of that is gamesmanship because you're trying to get a rematch anyway. And the whole game is about making more money. I'll tell you what, gentlemen, my entire career, I couldn't name one person that's ever filed a complaint. I know they've been filed, but I literally couldn't tell you the one guy that's done. And I know some guys think, hey listen, there was a misapplication of the rules.

Speaker 2:          01:23:41       I really like a review and I understand that. But again, I couldn't say state a case for you, but you know there's, there's other things like the First Amendment, I've got the right to say I didn't tap and any single fight that I want. Okay. The second one, fight ends. The marketing for the next fight begins. And if a fighter chooses to do that, he's got everywhere. There's nothing within the rules of a commission to say what a guy's going to say in his post fight interview. That's, that's silly. So you will say you're, you're essentially admitting that you will say untruthful things just in order to keep the hype going and that people should not miss a turn. There's a blurry line. Yeah. For me, no wrestling, blurry line. I'm not saying that for me, but you know, if I, if I'm saying me, I just meet an athlete in general and it can be any sport, but first I'm an athlete is not under oath so he can come out and say whatever when you're just a person.

Speaker 2:          01:24:33       And secondly, if one competition is, it could be baseball or fighting or whatever, the, the, the, the, the makings and the matchmaking in the and the shuffling and the politicking for the next event begins. And for somebody to come in and, and want an answer for that and try to attempt to regulate you is beyond inappropriate. I mean I would, I would want to say it's illegal. Again, it comes down to the first amendment. I can say whatever he wants and a post fight interview or post-match interview or game or whatever it is. I want to take myself out of this now. Right. You know, person in general come on, you can say whatever it was naturally, especially if you're considering that part of you as a, as an athlete to be sort of performance art. You're, you're actually, you have an act. I mean, and that act, it enhances your overall brand.

Speaker 2:          01:25:19       I mean, when you, when you go out there and you talk a bunch of crazy shit whether or not you believe in and people start talking about you becomes monetarily it advantageous to do that, you make more money that way. Brock Lesnar, I think a perfect example, you know, UFC 100 all of his fights, you know, Brock was always fun to listen. Do you want to know who else is fun? Is Quintin Jackson Quinten finishes a fight. We all sit there in the living room. Wait, wait, wait, Quentin's about to talk. And he says something funny whether he gives you a hard time or you on black crime and inviting people to an after party. You know, it's funny. And that's, and that's part of the show that people paid for. So that's not to say a fighter or again, any athlete has to do that. But if he chooses to, he's gotta be considered outside the scope of our, the regulatory body. I mean about them overstepping

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       that. That's beyond an appropriate, well I certainly think you should be able to ask a guy after he's fucking taking a shower and tell us what happened. I fucked up. I said I didn't tab or I was just losing my mind in there. Sure. But even if he doesn't, if he wants to take it to the gray, let's not forget the guy doesn't owe you anything. He's not under subpoena. He owes you nothing, including the truth if that's his choice. So for a government official, cause that's how this started is you were talking about a government for a government official to get involved and act as though he's going to suspend or uphold somebody's license because he didn't like something that he said in the media is inappropriate. I agree. Now what happened to you? I'm, I'm a, I'm a fascinated, I'm fascinated personally by big leaps in development.

Speaker 6:          01:26:51       I'm, I'm always fascinated when you hear about a guy, well yeah, he was a blue belt and then something happened and he went into Q, a few seminars and before, you know, he's fucking killing everybody at the Monday house you went from UFC was at UFC 60 that you find Jeremy Horn. Yeah. You were having some tough fights. Very impressed that you know that by the way. Good job pat. Thank you. See a lot of shows. Um, I can't remember where my fucking car keys are, but I can tell you a random UFC have no idea what I put my cell phone. But, but you, um, you fought Jeremy Horn and then was something happened between then and when you had a resurgence, which was, um, say what do you, what do you attribute your research into? Like what year do you think it's really started? I know where you're going with this and let, let me jump ahead.

Speaker 6:          01:27:39       You know what you're saying is, hey, I had some major submission problems and all of a sudden I started submitting some guy, not just that man, you became a more confident guy. You. Um, I, I don't want to undermine your confidence before cause I didn't know you. I meant uh, I mean the, the way you presented yourself I should say, um, you, you got way better at marketing yourself and you started fucking dominating Tom Fly. It's like you hate your own. You had a, a personal wall and you got through that fucking thing. You got through that fucking thing and you made a big leap, you know, and when, when you fought Nate Marquardt, I think that was the fight that really opened up a lot of people's eyes. Just like, Whoa, like channel Sonnen's a motherfucker. I remember me and Eddie Bravo had dinner after that and it was like, how bout that power double God. Damn. It's like Nate could not keep you off of them. And we were, we were thinking about it and was like, wow, what a nightmare. It's like you had, you had figured out a way to get all of your potential out inside the octagon. What happened? I appreciate it

Speaker 5:          01:28:35       in and out. You don't know and training either. For me, I had a fight with you Chenault calm and he was ranked number two in the world and I was just one of those guys that was kind of looked at as a top 10 that was right before I fought my more, couldn't, it gave me a lot of confidence. But here's what happened Joe. I have never lost a round of fighting. And, and when I say that, sometimes the guy, I'll laugh giggle cause I've lost some fights but I've never lost around. I've never had a fight where a judge ever scored around against me and tell last match with Bisping. So at the point of your story though, I sit down one day and I'm looking at it, I'm sure it all.com I bring myself up. I'm looking at my record. I've won every round I've ever fought.

Speaker 5:          01:29:10       I've never been in a tough fight. I've never had stitches, I've never broken it. I've dominated everybody and I've lost eight fights and I lost all of them by submission and I lost all of them in the second round. And I'm staring at that on the computer. I'm staring at these numbers, like a CEO would, his spreadsheet, and I'm saying, there's something going on here and it's not physical. There's something going on that I can dominate eight minutes of a fight, seven minutes of a fight, nine minutes of a fight and find a way out time after time, after time in the same round with the same move. And so I find I wouldn't get it. I wouldn't get help. I went and got professional help and, uh, I sought out a doctor, ed Versteeg. Uh, I hate talking about this because this was a real seat as a real turning point for me is when I went in, worked on sports psychology, got hypnotized.

Speaker 5:          01:29:56       I was never the same. I was never the same in practice. My attitude was different. Uh, controlling my diet, being disciplined, falling asleep. The way I approached battle, the way I approached the second round, everything changed. And it changed to the point where I hate to say what I just said and now it's too late. Uh, because I felt like it was my secret. I discovered and I don't want other people to know. I'll write about it someday in a book. I'll talk about it, you know, when I'm retired, but I'm not gonna tell anybody cause its competitive edge. And when I started seeing a sports psychologist, when I finally came clean, you know, it was like being an alcoholic before you can get help, you've got to admit you have a problem. And when I finally admitted I got a problem, when I finally said it, when I finally could acknowledge and look somebody in the eye and tell him this is what's going on, I'm finding a way to lose as opposed to when I work harder than these guys.

Speaker 5:          01:30:46       I've been at this long drive, I'm losing, I know how to stop submissions. I'm finding my way into them. I'm finding a way out and that's what's happening. I had to acknowledge that. And once I did it, I never lost again. I lost to Paulo, which was, you know the controversial one. I lost a to Anderson after dominate, you know, I've never been beat since it says I saw this doctor. That's incredible. Now, Joe, let me ask you a question. Are you ever allowed to give a shout out on the show? Like, do you ever say hi to anybody? Like if I was to say hi Brittany, because my girlfriend just texted musicians watching the show and I mentioned the name Brittany to earn myself special points. Is that going to take you off? Cause I won't go. And then I'm going to say, Brittany, if this is going to be like a cheap plug in, you're going to get mad.

Speaker 4:          01:31:23       I'll do it. Hello Brittany. Thanks for tuning in. Thank you buddy. Very nice. Yeah, that's a beautiful story, man. I knew there must have had to been something on the mental side because, um, you know, I, I remember as you do that the [inaudible] was a, an excellent performance and uh, I'm, I remember being really impressed with that, but even more so impressed with the Nate Marquardt fight because, you know, I knew that you should was a grappler. I wasn't surprised that you were a, a stronger grasp within him, but I was surprised that Nate Marquardt just couldn't stop you from taking them down. He just could not stop you and the way you were doing it, you were ragdoll on him to the point where we're like, Jesus, like this guy is a fucking nightmare for a of dudes, man. And we started like, then we started doing the matchups, you know, you start thinking in your head, what about him? But when you fought Anderson, man, whew, that was a, that was a crazy fight man. For four minutes or for a four rounds. And how many minutes into the fifth round? Four minutes and 31 seconds. But who's keeping track? Four minutes and 31 seconds. Ava have a five minute round

Speaker 5:          01:32:20       motherfucker.

Speaker 4:          01:32:23       What was that like? What was that like when it happened?

Speaker 5:          01:32:25       It was devastating. I'll, I'll tell you what they, I had no idea what was happening in that fight. None. And when the fight was over, I was devastated. And they, they, they, I came to and I said to the ref, you know, the typical thing, like a Doofus, what happened? The referee, Josh Rosenthal is a fantastic referee. Simply says, you tapped out and he looks at me for a response. Like I was going to argue and I simply say, I believe you now. I knew that because ESPN zoomed in on that and showed it. But that's all I said. I said, I believe you and I, and that was,

Speaker 4:          01:32:56       remember what happened when you, when you were, did you, uh, think of tapping and you went out? Like what happened?

Speaker 5:          01:33:02       No, I, I remember falling asleep. You know, it's a very weird experience if you've ever been at, and I know you practice it, so you have been, but it's a very weird experience. You know, when you're actually going asleep and you're, but you're trying to, to, to stay within reality. And I remember having a dream thinking, well, if I tap, I could get out of this now let's not tab and fight was over. And you know, I had already tagged that if I hit his split and I didn't fully know what happened when it was over and I came to, I didn't fully know what I'm trying to figure out what just happened. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:33:30       Most people by the way, who have never been choked out. We'll never be able to understand that. And they'll, they'll call like fake tap and this nap. But you, unless you've done it, unless you've been choked, you really don't understand how confusing it is. Sure. There's a lot of guys who don't, they don't know what happened. Right. When they wake up. It's a mess.

Speaker 5:          01:33:45       And I, and I'm one of those guys, I was with the other people where I would always see fighters go, what happened after they got knocked as it come on, dummy. You know what happened? No, you don't. You're sure. Especially from a concussion. Yes. Especially from chaos. Absolutely don't know. You know? So aside from being choked, you know, don't forget, don't forget, I've got fatigue issues. I got blood and Vaseline in my eyes. I got exhaustion, I got a anxiety. I get it. See, I'm a normal human being. I feel every emotion. So many people say to me, Oh, you're never scared. Yeah, I come on, I'm a human. It fill it all. But uh, you know, so what? So I lose the fight. We go in the back and they bring me the fight of the night check. They pay you immediately. If you get a bonus, boom.

Speaker 5:          01:34:21       Here, here's your check. And I remember thinking, you gave me that at a sympathy because that was such a boring fight. You know, nothing happened. You gave me that as simple, I'll take it. You know, I'm fighting back the tears. I'm just devastated. Absolutely devastated by this defeat. And later the fight gets named not only fight of the night, it was called fight of the year. We won the award from a fighter's only magazine, which puts on the award show, uh, for fight of the year. So it ended up being a really good fight. But my point that I'm trying to get at, that's how out of touch I was with what was happening in the ring. You know, at one point my cornerman told me it's round four when it was around five or he told me it was round four when it was around, through whatever it was, the corner had the rounds off.

Speaker 5:          01:35:01       Um, you know, the instruction I was getting was a little bit off and I just didn't fully know what was going on. And in this next fight I'd like to, you know, as I visualize and plan for it, that's one of the things I'd like to be a little more aware and a little more in touch with what's happening. But, uh, it's hard. It's hard in the octagon, man. A lot of stuff goes out the window. You get hit, you get kicked, you get, it's tough. It's tough to stay focused. How tough is it to describe to someone who's never had that experience? It's almost impossible. You know, I almost can't do it. It's like when you, you know, an executive director comes at you and wants to know that we were talking about earlier, hey, why did you do this? And you're kind of going, you know, I don't really know how to put it into words.

Speaker 5:          01:35:43       And I don't mean this condescendingly, but obviously you've never been in that spot because it's one of those indescribable feelings. And when you have victory, that's also an indescribable feeling. When you make that walk in front of 17,000 people screaming, cheering, booing, whatever it is, that's also an indescribable feeling. Uh, so it's a very unique sport. And you know, people will always ask me on Game Day, are you ready? Are you excited and a, are you scared? You know, you'll get these questions. And the answer is no, but I can't tell you what I am either. For all the human emotions that have definitions, I don't know how to describe what it's like on fight day. It's a combination of many things and if we're going to be truthful, most of them are unpleasant. It's a very stressful situation. You know, you're walking into battle, you've prepared for this, and it's all on the line and it's on the line in front of everybody.

Speaker 5:          01:36:37       And there's a great relief if you have victory in a great despair, if you have defeat. Absolutely. Proportionately used a very interesting word there that surprise me that you, you, you, you said relief. You didn't say happy. You said relief and Joe, you could not be more correct. I, I had a fight with Brian Stann after I was out for 14 months dealing after the Anderson loss. I had to deal with the commission. I didn't go back and deal with these guys. I got this suspension. I got it. Everything puts me off for 14 months. It was eight days later before I was back to myself emotionally because all I was for that week plus was relieved. It was the ultimate exhale of my life. I wasn't happy. I won. I wasn't excited. I was relieved. It was over. I was just relieved that I made it through, you know, from the way into the process to the licensing.

Speaker 1:          01:37:29       I made it through and got out of there. That's very interesting that you use that word. Well, I used to experience a relief from taekwondo tournaments, which in comparison to MMA is absolutely, it's benign. I mean, it's not, not even remotely as draining as physically demanding, as scary. You know? All the above, but I still would get a great relief when, when I was, when I was done, you know, I go through a tournament, it'd over, I could rest

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       for a couple of weeks. It wouldn't have to thank, and then when I finally stopped competing completely, it was the weirdest feeling ever. This weird feeling of not worrying about six months in the future, like don't have a drink now because if you do, what if you want up getting drunk and then you can't train as well tomorrow and then six weeks in the future you're, you're off and you lose because you fucked up and you slacked off. There was always this impending doom cycle, but MMA, it's gotta be 100,000 times. That last time I tried to sneak out of here to go to the bathroom. You made an announcement, chill, you're going to urinate. Don't tell anybody. It embarrasses me and me just sneak out like a little kid. So don't mention it. I won't say I'm going to run out of it, but I don't want you to tell it. I won't even talk about it. Are you going to snap it down? Joe, I want to tell you this though, when I come back cause I don't know what our timeline is. Story that I want to make sure I tell. Do you know who DB Cooper is? Yes, I do bring him up when I come back. Okay. I will.

Speaker 2:          01:38:48       Powerful Chelsea on ladies and gentlemen. I don't know what he's doing. I don't ask a man. Ask a man what kind of, uh, movements he's doing so that, that, that note, that Samsung Galaxy note or whatever. Oh, we're talking about the giant cell phones. Yeah, it's a, it's, if it has, no one's seen it. It's pretty much maybe this big. It's 5.3 inch, 5.3 so it's like, it's, it's like almost like a small kindle or small

Speaker 6:          01:39:14       tablet and it's a phone and it slips into your pocket and it has a crazy process or really ridiculously fast. Giant screen. You can draw on pictures like socket, I'm here with stupid. He could take pictures and like you could draw on them. You, when you watch a web pages on it, it's incredible. It's the best cell phone web experience ever. There's been a lot of talks that the iPads is going to have a smaller version, like a seven inch version of it. Unless the phone, I don't give a fuck. They should make a five inch phone. Just make it stop beds. We like big shit. I use my phone half the time to look at my email half the time to, you know, I mean between 50 and 60% of the time is not making phone calls. It's doing other cool shit. Getting online, got pocket things going to be a pain in the ass.

Speaker 6:          01:39:59       I bet that note is just a pain like it having an old trio pocket or something. I'm glad you asked this Brian, because I have recently gone back to the fanny pack. I got a new one. I ordered one from roots because Andrew dice clay had it when we were doing the podcast with him and the other day I remember that. Yeah, you got it. You got to, I got dice class. I did get a little jealous of is fantastically designed fanny pack. I was like, that's a real goddamn fanny pack. So I ordered one online and two days later I got it and I'm very happy. So I'd carry that note around gladly inside my fanny pack. I'm bringing back the fanny pack strong. By the way, shout out to Chris Liebing. There was photos of Chris Liebing in Hawaii wearing a fanny pack. Way To go, Chris, keep on rocking in the free world.

Speaker 2:          01:40:42       You know, you, you bring up Chris leave. But if I can jump in here real fast, I don't know if I'm interrupting something, but uh, uh, I threw, in any event, I throw an event, it was like an after party with jail and it was a colossal failure.

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       Nobody shows that we've got 18 people. We've got this whole to ourself, you know, we get drinks, we've got a DJ with, it's a massive failure. So we ended up turning the radio off and we all just end up sitting down and talking. And by the end of the night, it couldn't have gone any better. I know everybody, I, okay, this guy's on his, uh, you know his honeymoon. This guy's wife bought in presence. These, these guys, it's their anniversary. I know everybody in the room. I know him by name. I know what city they're from. We spent about three hours talking and I'm telling them stories. I'm telling them stories of UFC behind the scenes stuff, you know. Um, and I'm, I'm running out of stories. They're like, tell us another story. And I'm like, you know, it was great stories. Is Chris leaving? The problem is he never answers his phone.

Speaker 5:          01:41:32       So they're like, call Chris, you know, so I'm getting peer pressure to do so I'm calling Chris on Speaker. I call him, he answers his phone. I go leave and his tail. I'm at an afterparty. You're on speaker. I've got about 20 people here. They can all hear you. I've been telling stories and I'm out. I need you to tell one. And he's like, you want to tell him a story? Why don't you tell about the time that my mom hit a deer loaded in the back of her hatchback for God about it for two weeks. Then her and my uncle come over, throw it on the kitchen table, cut it up with chainsaws. I've been in my room. I'd been punished because I got sent home from school and a detention. So they make me sample the meat to make sure it's not rancid and I end up in the hospital for three weeks with the Cola.

Speaker 5:          01:42:09       Why don't you tell him that story? He doesn't miss a beat. He just rattles this story off. He puts this whole Party on its head. I mean these people, nobody left. They are in shock, including me. I'm in shot. Wait a minute. Your mother. I got to go, Chris. I gotta go. Thanks. I just hang up. And because he did that for me because he told this story to this disaster party that I threw. I've always been grateful and indebted to him. Like Chris, I owe you went, you know you saved me a so there's my shout out to Chris Lee, but how's that for a great story? That's a fucking great story. Cause it same shit when a childhood. Wow. Oh he can go on and on. Chris and Chris has some other great stories. You know, some guys have a rough man. That's rough. Wow, that sucks.

Speaker 5:          01:42:53       Yeah. Chris is Chris. Chris, his aunt and uncle greatly raised him. So he goes out on, uh, what do you call it? Jet Skiing or whatever. Whatever you do on the water skiing. And he's out with his uncle and aunt and his uncle is drinking and they t bone above and his, his aunt, the uncles wife is back on the shore. Sunbae then she doesn't go out with them. The team on a boat and they hurt the people. So the people, the, the wife goes over and they're helping the wife of the other boat is going over. So they get the husband and the wife and the boat and you know, she's not that bad, but she fell over in her boat, doesn't run anymore. So the uncles tell him, listen, listen, I've been drinking. I don't have insurance, but I really will make this right with you if you just don't call the police. As a matter of fact, here's my name, here's my number. Please call me and let's settle this. So yeah, anything and just get us to shore. You know, I got to get the hospital, how my leg looked at. They pull up to the shore, the ant stands up cause she sees there's some woman on the boat. She wants to know what Hell's going on. So she gets

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       a little bit closer and she sees this woman is holding Chris's uncle's a piece of paper with his name and number on it. She has no idea. She's been t bunches, no idea. They've rescued him taking them to the hospital and it's her husband's fault is she? She sees the number with his name on it.

Speaker 5:          01:44:07       It says that's my husband and bitch and slaps the woman who's on her way to the hospital cause she got t boned by the uncle. So this is Chris's childhood. So you like the Chris leaves or I could go on and on and on. As a matter of fact, I bought for $100 I bought a bunch of Chris Liebing stories. But they backed by. Yeah. But then he started telling people that these were his stories. Chris, that's not your story. That's my story. That didn't happen with your uncle. My uncle did and he doubled and I got the idea from a Seinfeld where Kramer bought a bunch of Peterman stories. So I paid Chris everything. He took the money and then he still was trying to claim this stuff happen to him. So I didn't really work out for me. How did you keep his story straight in your head?

Speaker 5:          01:44:52       Why just do cause he's got three crazy stories and get the store manager to buy. I bought them all. I bought the whole gamut. We went to Japan together. It's a nine hour flight. And so he told story after story. So I bought ourselves, give you 100 bucks for the story. But he didn't know how it worked. He apparently thought this was some funny deal where he takes my money and goes, buys a little Saki and Sushi for the, just say, no, no, no. Those are no mice or he didn't get the Gig. He didn't get it. So he double crossed me, took the money and he took the stories back. I got nothing. I had to write my own book. I don't remember if I own stories. Chris Liebing stories would have been better. Oh, that's fucking hilarious. I've never heard of anybody buying someone's stories. Paid $100 for it because that was a lot of money. But I only got $1,000 for the fight over there.

Speaker 2:          01:45:35       Holy Shit. That's funny. Oh my God. That is ridiculous. Now what the fuck was it like going to Brazil? You went to Brazil recently, you know, after all this shit that you talked about Brazil and minister to the Minotauro Nogueira brothers. Okay. Nothing's funny isn't that a bus was a horse. That's funny you say that because good for you. Because sometimes when you're talking about Nogueira people forget there's two and they're our brothers. You know, and you need to be specific, you know, are you talking about the big one or the little one? Are you talking about the fat one or the Baldwin or talking about the one that used to be good or the one that never was. And it's important that you say that. So good for you for saying there's brothers. Cause a lot of people just think it's the same guy filling in, but it's actually to, what was it like when you went to Brazil? Awesome.

Speaker 5:          01:46:16       You want to know what I had a great time is really Brittany

Speaker 2:          01:46:19       got to go, uh, you know, we go out with Dana. Um, and we were only there for four hours and you know, first off, Rio's beautiful. And I've been to Brazil before. In fact, I was at Abi Dhabi one that you were, I don't know. I don't know if you would have known who I was back then. But when, when, uh, Eddie, uh, beat a Heuler, what was it? 2003 I believe in Sao Paulo. In fact, I was there, uh, Ryan Parsons was with us. At any rate, I had been to Brazil before you do it with Matt. And I loved it. I wrestled myself. I lost to a cocker Rico, Mr Guillotine. Remember that guy? I think a strong, anyhow, Luke to leave speed up the story. So we get there and we got our own security detail and it's tight. I mean these are, these are some bad looking dudes and a, I'm surrounded with tough looking guys all the time.

Speaker 2:          01:47:03       This was a whole nother level man. These guys got the scars, these guys got the bullet holes. These guys got the, the stitching and the whole bit where you get that. Anyway, we're with, we got this bad team now. I've never been on a helicopter, but I love carnivals, I love rides. So we go everywhere by helicopter, which apparently is extremely common in Brazil. It's like the number one a hell port country in the world. So these are good helicopters with pilots are very reputable. And next thing I know we're up in the air. So this is the ultimate carnival ride. Now we're there on a gorgeous day in Rio, which is a gorgeous city and we've got it from a bird's eye view. I mean I would take that whole trip, all the risk, all the danger, everything that I had to go through for that 15 minute helicopter ride.

Speaker 2:          01:47:45       Um, I'm a Catholic. I went over this church. That's like one of the wonders of the world. It's not, it's not quite as, uh, you know, eighth wonder of the world, like the pyramids, but it's close where you look at and go, how in the heck did you build that hundreds of years ago up on this cliff? There's no roads up to it. You got to walk. It's just, just incredible. Well, there's a lot of speculation about the history of Brazil. It's coming to light. Recently I think there's some Roman artifacts. They found some really ancient stuff and uh, some, uh, there's some dispute about there, found some offshore records or something like that. So they, uh, they're now thinking that maybe the Romans had even a visited Brazil even before the Portuguese. Pretty a amazing country. When you stop and think about the history, the history of it.

Speaker 2:          01:48:26       Yeah. You know, so I have a feeling when you asked me what was it like how are we received? Is there any threads? And, uh, you know, the way I like to tell it as that it was, it was a scene, man. It was, we were, we were, we were down in the trenches over there. But you know the reality, I really liked it there. And it's interesting, everybody knows who we are there. You know, if I want to be famous in America, Joe, I got to go to a fight. If I go to a fight, I'm a big deal. If I'm not at a fight, I'm not, I'm just regular guy, which is just fine. But I mean, you know, sometimes people lose sight of that. And in Brazil they all knew who we were. You know, they definitely knew Dana and they all knew who I was.

Speaker 2:          01:49:04       And I mean all of them, from the bus drivers to the people, to the people working the desk to the cops, everybody, the people at the airports. And here's how Dana described it to me. He goes to jail. Everybody watches a playoff game for the NFL in America. Right? Everybody watched that go. Yeah, everybody watches it play off. He goes, okay, that everybody has 15 million Americans. He said in Brazil, 80 million Brazilians tuned in when Vandelay or rather when Anderson and v Tor fought. So those are the kinds of numbers. That's how inundated people are with this sport. And that's prior to us bring, bringing them this new ultimate fighter with Vandelay and [inaudible] that's airing. So what I'm getting at is this sports huge over there. And, and until you're there, you don't realize it. And uh, so

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       at any rate, you know, I'm getting recognized left and right, and that's fun. That's fun for my ego. I'm having a good time. You know, I'm somebody and they want to talk to me. They want an autograph. They're all very nice. Now, I didn't really have time to exhale and enjoy this because I've got so many death threats that are very legitimate. You know, guys not only telling me they're going to kill me, they're telling me how they're telling me when they're telling me the, the lake they're going to drag my body into. You know, I've got this security team because the U of C's been warned, you know, so I'm on edge constantly and I see some kid. Is that the kid? Is that the, is this the guy? You know, I'm constantly looking around. I want, I'm only human. This is how my mind's working. So by the time we left, the experience was great.

Speaker 5:          01:50:28       Looking back at the time I was there, you're on edge. You know you're looking around. Who's the God? Who's The guy? You know? My Dad had a real basic rule when you thought you were in trouble, don't let anybody within arm's reach. If the guide comes with an arm's reach, hit him. Don't wait for this first punch crap. If you feel you're in danger and it gets within arm's reach, you strike first and get out of there. Everybody's on you like this. So I'm baking. I'm going against the most basic rule my own father taught me when I'm seven years old. And that's let people in close when you're scared. So I've got my back up against the wall. You don't have fallen his second rule, but the first one is completely, completely broken. But you know, we had a good time. We were you

Speaker 4:          01:51:04       like the fight was supposed to take place for people who don't know the rematch between chill and for folks who weren't following MMA, a lot of people that listen to this podcast aren't even MMA fans. You, uh, after, after the Anderson Silva fight you, you said a, a bunch of crazy shit about Brazil, about insulted them quite a bit. And then they were going to have the rematch and an 80,000 seat soccer arena in Brazil. But unfortunately because the UN is having a visit there, uh, two days before there was no hotels, there was logistically almost impossible to bring that many people into an 80,000 seat arena was just, it wasn't going to happen. So it's been moved to Las Vegas. Was that good? Was it, were you happy when it was moved to Vegas? You

Speaker 5:          01:51:48       know, if I had, if I have to answer yes or no, the answer is yes, but there's also a tremendous no, and the no is simply that I was going to get a be part of history and the current record is Toronto St Pierre Versus Shields 55,000 live. We were going to do 80 to a hundred thousand live and that would have been very hard to beat. So I could have taken that record for not only currently but, but maybe into my future years and pass that story down to generations. And you know, again, that's an ego boost and, and there's something to be said for that. If we're, if we're being candid that I'd want the other side of his, she's, I don't want to fly 14 hours anywhere while I'm cutting weight. Now somebody has to, Anderson did it the last time. Uh, and we fought in California. So, and fairness, I'll, I'll go out there, but how much does Anderson could, you know, I don't know. He probably weighs about two 20. I've been next to me, he looks as big as me. I'm riding around two 20, a little taller, so it's hard to judge. But uh, you know, looking Anderson lives in California, so he flies to hours to Vegas. I'm an Oregon is two hours to Vegas and we both got home field and manage. What's the difference in that? In that aspect of it?

Speaker 4:          01:52:58       Yeah. The cutting weight is a, it's a very strange aspect of MMA isn't it? It's really almost like an art and a discipline in and of itself.

Speaker 5:          01:53:05       And a battle, you know, you could be a black belt in cutting weight or you could be a white belt and a, you know, to compare it to being like martial arts. Like you said it is. Some guys are skilled in it. Some guys are experts. You get your mic, dolce chase, they got more secrets than, than you could imagine to get weight off in. Other guys aren't either guys starved because they don't know what else to do or they miss wait, you know, we see guys miss wait too. And that's a big deal when you sign a contract. That's part of it. And you've got to honor that. How,

Speaker 4:          01:53:31       how much of your thought process would have been dedicated if there was a fight, how much of it would have been just to worried about your, be worried about your safety, constantly worried about your food being poisoned, worry about someone fucking with you. I mean, what would have been like to compete under that sort of an environment that if folks who don't know, I've never seen a crowd more nationalistic than Brazil. It's amazing how patron

Speaker 5:          01:53:54       they get it, right? That's the way you should be. They get it right. You fucking get it right, your back, your guy, they do that,

Speaker 4:          01:54:01       Lynn. But in England they also, when when a fighter wins, the guy wins. They applaud his skill. Even if a guy beats a hometown guy, you know, I've seen it in London, I've seen them applaud when a fighter beat a local English guy and they were talking afterwards. But man, it doesn't happen in Brazil. Mike Pyle one, he beat Ricardo Funche and they were all together chanting some sort of gay slur, Portuguese gay slur. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:54:25       And I was like, no, I'm aware. You know that's unfortunate when that happens. You know, you don't want to behave like a savage or or or, or uncivilized. I mean we are in a society here and if you're a fan of you buy a ticket, you can share bu whoever you want, but that's where it ends. Don't touch a guy I won't touch. I don't like all the fans. I like most of them. I don't like 'em all but I never touch one. But the same thing goes for them. If you're a fan, you don't reach over that rail and slap it a guy and throw your drink on. I mean,

Speaker 4:          01:54:46       what do you think it would have been like though if you would one in Brazil in front of 80,000

Speaker 5:          01:54:51       it would have been a scene. I don't think they could've controlled it. They, they swore that they could, they'd have presidential security there. They were planning to have the president of Brazil there so they'd have their secret services. It's like, guys, you can't do it. Know there was just a soccer game. There was just a soccer game and 73 people were trampled to death. You know, you can't control crowds when they decide to storm. You just can't. It's displaced responsibility. I'm a sociologist, I, I've studied this. I've written papers on displaced responsibility. You can't control that. Especially when I'm the main event. And the relevance to that is it means the beer started pouring five hours earlier. So now you're not only talking to insightful crowd, you're talking about a drunk crowd. And a, what I'm referring to is if I beat Anderson up, I go into Brazil, I stomped their he row.

Speaker 5:          01:55:35       Uh, and then I'm going to do an interview with you. And it's not gonna stop and I'm not gonna apologize to any one of them. So how they thought they were to control that, I don't know. But uh, you know, if the, what did you think was going to happen? I think they would have, I think it would have been bad. I think it would have been very, very bad and I, and I would not have, have, have backed off one bit because I'm not going to change, you know, I'm going to dance with the one that brought me. I'm going to be aggressive. I'm going to be in your face. I'm going to get my mind right, my approach right. I'm going to do my job as soon as Bruce buffer gets out of my way. And, uh, and that's it. And I can't change, I mean, I don't know how to change. This is what I'm programmed to do. And uh, you know, I hate to talk like one of those main x Oh, to give him my life pub, Blah. But Joe, I swear to you, hand to God, I'd given my life to win that championship if I had to. Whoa.

Speaker 5:          01:56:27       I mean, let's not forget, this is a tough guy talk. I signed the contract to go to Brazil to do the fight. And in my heart I thought, I don't know how this is going to go. I made my mother promise you wouldn't go. You know, my mother doesn't get it. She's an older woman. She's got a ruby or a diamond on every finger. You know, you don't go into South America like that level on a fight. It was just one of those deals. But it, look, this is what I'm going to do. Wow. That's a crazy stance, man. That's a crazy mindset. I agree. I don't know that I'm proud of that. I don't, I don't, I don't mean to sit here and sound like a big tough guy. That's not really what I'm doing. I'm just trying to be candid, but you know, this is what I'm going to do at work my whole life for it. And if this is how it ends is how it ends, but I'm going to get that before I go.

Speaker 1:          01:57:05       You can't really discount the amount of, uh, a boost the hometown fighter would get from a crowd like that or the amount of shock, the, uh, the opponent would get from 80,000 people bullying you and you are ready to jump right into.

Speaker 5:          01:57:20       Well, that was one of my favorite things. You know, some guys beg for applause and I've seen some fighters, it hurts their feelings. You know, John John's golf, she hates if anybody booze. And I'm on the other side of that man. I just, I like it. I like it. I love it when they cheer too. You know, I'm not the guy that feeds off negativity, but I do feed off of it. You know, if a guy, I'll pay three and a half dollars for an overpriced drink at the MGM and throw it on me. That's a compliment to me. You know, if five incited him that much, he's a fan. And how often does that happen? It's happened a few times. You know, where they've thrown something. I've actually never had a drink. I had one guy so mad he took his own hat off his head and throw it at me.

Speaker 5:          01:57:58       He missed. But you know, you get the point. I kind of felt like I was wanting to hand it back to them. But you know, it's one of those deals, but you know, they get so insightful. But you know, don't forget the other side of that coin. Not only are they upset with me, but they're cheering. They're guy. You know, if you want to back your guy, you're a fan man. You work hard for that money. You took the night off, you know, you, you talk dad into bringing out to the fight, be a fee. Don't touch anybody but be a fan even if that means to bu. So what,

Speaker 1:          01:58:27       that's interesting. That's a very interesting point of view. I would prefer people not boo cause it's kind of cunty and it's disrespectful for someone who is doing what is essentially the most difficult sport known to man and doing it for your

Speaker 2:          01:58:41       and just because it doesn't go the way of the fight or that you like, you're going to boo and hiss and say stupid shit. That shows a massive level of immaturity that I don't necessarily think we need in this world. I think it's, it's 2012 and you stupid asses need to catch up. That's what I'd think. Sure. I know. So fair opinion. When I hear people blew at a good fight, I'm like, that can't be anybody other than a fucking moron. Right. You know, and I hear that. I'll hear that, but he doesn't. Sometimes I bite my tongue and sometimes I don't. But when sometimes people are booing a good fight, a good positional battle or you know, a good, they don't understand it, so they're booing or it goes to the ground, so they're born. It's just a, it's so, it's so stupid and disrespectful.

Speaker 2:          01:59:20       Meanwhile, these same dump Fox will sit there and watch baseball. They'll watch a live baseball game. One of the most boring events known to man. Something that you could never introduce to another country in 2012 you could never bring baseball today. They'd be like boring as fuck. Silly all with the stick game. You look at football and people just adored in this country. And again, good for them. But you know, in a four and a half hour NFL game, there are seven and a half minutes of action. If you start the timer and you turn it on, I'm going, you know, I, I can't, I can't play along that. That's exciting. You know, I don't know. I don't know that I have add, but I do for that. You're going to do it and then you're going to take a break. And then these, the, these big, large, but they're all muscled up and they see, they run to their mailbox.

Speaker 2:          02:00:03       They got to stop at the neighbor's kid's lemonade stand there. So out of shape. You know, these guys, they played for seven and half minutes. You know how many times they're good with the water bucket? What are you doing? Good. How are you possibly tired? I miss, and you're doing your show for several hours. I don't know. I don't have anything to drink. You know, what are they? They're dragging down the Gatorade. It's, hey, I don't get it. You know, and some people cheer these guys. It's like, you know, good for you. I know. I'm the, I'm the minority. I'm the one missing out. My life would be better if I can really get into sports and have something to do that because I'd have something to do. You know, I used to, I used to have to count down you fcs, which were five a year, you know, six a year.

Speaker 2:          02:00:38       And then pride would do four or five. You know what? I would count those days down, literally count on dummy and my dad would be titanic. Abbott's going to fight this guy. We yell, it's not missing. We're going to have a party. And, uh, you know, so what I'm saying is if I, if I could get in that same passion for other sports, I'd have a better life. I'd have hobbies. I have something to do like my friends and sit up and they watch sports center and somehow they're entertained by that. I don't get as good. I think you're better off without it. And I don't, I don't think it's bad to have one or two sports that you're into. There's nothing wrong with that. But I know guys who their whole life was just following other people doing shit. And I hear you. I hear you.

Speaker 2:          02:01:11       That happens a lot. I can't get behind football. I appreciate it. I respect them as athletes, some incredible athletes and football. But it, to me, it's just, I don't care what you do with that ball. It doesn't mean anything to me. Yeah, no, I understand. You know, I mean, I was on Jim Rome earlier today and it's like, you know, Jim, how many times have you had to sit here and interview a golfer or a tennis player or a Nascar guy? Could you imagine being a NASCAR, you push your foot down and you make left turns all afternoon long and somehow that's a,

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       that's a meaningful event to society. And I'm scratching my head going, you know, I wish that I was one of those guys that enjoy this, but I just, I don't get you're making left turns all Sunday afternoons. What? Damning appraisals of America. Yeah. And I just, I don't understand it. You know, I'm talking to Jim Rome and it's like, you know, Jim, good for you. You finally got that he's somebody and you know, you're, you're welcoming and he is very welcome. He's an absolute ally to the UFC. You know, Dana White went on a rant one time. It was great against ESPN where he, you know, Dana was mad Esbi Mri and then he finishes by going the only thing good as Jim Rome, you know, he didn't, he, he made sure to give Jim that property cause Jim deserves it. He's one of the, those leaders that came out and he embraced, uh, martial arts and the UFC to be specific.

Speaker 5:          02:02:23       Yeah. Good for him. I'm glad he did that. Now I want to tell you this story. Can I? Okay. So I wrote this book, uh, the voice of reason which comes out tomorrow. Let me give myself a chip pass to enlightened. Thank you very much. Vip Pass the layman, the hips, the bookshelves. Tomorrow is available right now@amazon.com. This isn't a plug for the book. That was a plug. I'm done. Okay. I want to tell you a story. I've only told the story twice in my life, so I don't know if I'm good at telling it. I told this e w when you write a book these days, you don't actually have to write anything. You talk it all out. It all goes into the stance of whatever they call it. And then they, they go back and they type it out for you. So I tell this story and I know who DB Cooper is.

Speaker 5:          02:03:05       Okay. I know who DB Cooper is. My whole family knows and it's, it's been like a family secret or, or however for a number of years. So you know who the guy is. I know who he is. He's alive and well and a lot of times over the past few years, somebody will be on their deathbed. You know, this just happened about four years ago. The guys on his deathbed and he comes out and says, I'm DB Cooper. And he tells his whole family and they go to the media and the media jumps mining and says, well, it must be true because why else would you want to go down as a criminal on your deathbed? And I'm sitting there and I told everybody that would listen when they look into these facts of this guy's putting out, I assure you, that won't be DB. I told everybody, but I never told them why.

Speaker 5:          02:03:41       I never told him how I was so confident. It's my big, big worldwide news. DB Cooper case finally saw and then they unraveled it. And sure enough it was, if I told everybody that wasn't him. Well the reason I knew it wasn't him was I know who db Cooper is. My whole family knew and it was a secret and my father passed away. So now the seat now, now my oath to keep it a secret has also passed away. I don't feel that I, I can't reveal the story. He's alive and well. I know exactly who he is. So I tell the story in my book and you know, there's a lot of things that happened in the DB Cooper case and so I need to really make this shorter. I could take up your whole a whole show with this, but once folks who don't know who db Cooper is, once we explain that very famous, he's the world's most famous hijacker and I believe he's the most famous one because he was never caught but two, he may have been the first hijacker and I want to say this happened like in the 70s and db Cooper hijacks a plane, he makes it through security or securities, totally different back then, gets on board.

Speaker 5:          02:04:34       He's in a cheap disguise. Uh, he orders the plane, be touched down, says he's got a device in a bomb, a bomb in his, in his, in his bag, shows it to a flight attendant. They touched down. There he is, brings him up on that. Now that's a sketch deposit. Of course, nobody knows what he actually looks like, but that, that's the sketch deposit. If the viewers can see that. So at any rate, they touched the plane down, they bring him as 200,000 in cash and unmarked bills and they go back up. Well, while the Rup he parachutes, they don't know he's got a parachute. Now where the story gets interesting is he was never found, but the money wasn't either. No sign of him was found. His parachute wasn't found, his body wasn't found. And one of the things that was a problem is where he jumped was a mass forest.

Speaker 5:          02:05:16       I mean miles upon miles, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of square acres of nothing but four. So basically what any expert would say is, look, he didn't make it. If he even made the fall, he would have been eaten by coyotes or bay there. There's good reason why we never found his body and it's not because he made it out of their life. Okay, now you need a couple of those details. So how do I know him? Well, a family friend and I put this all in the book, I put all of this in the book and the publisher didn't use it. And the reason he wouldn't use it is because I won't tell the ne I tell the whole story and about to do that for you now, but I don't reveal the name. He goes with with how to name, I can't use it. I go, wait, that's ridiculous.

Speaker 5:          02:05:57       I can touch on every single detail you're not. And I, and I'm telling my poster going, hey, I don't think you know who db coopers, I think you should. I think you should Google him. You know there's movies made on him. Prison break just had a character pretending to be db Cooper folklore has been made out of this guy. Well where this guy jumped was, was government land, but that land backed up to Indian land and this gentleman was part Indian and he grew up in this forest. This is where he spent his summers, months after months. They would go out and camp in there, you know, in between school breaks. From the time he was a little kid all the way on, he knew right where he was jumping and if anybody could have made it, it was this guy. Now my dad grew up with this guy.

Speaker 5:          02:06:38       He was a family friend and back then parachuting, well much like now is very uncommon. If somebody does it, you go tell all your friends, I found this parachuting class I'm going to do, they take pictures and they showed up. This guy was taking parachute and lessons. He didn't tell anybody. And uh, and he started taking motorcycle classes and stuff. It wasn't telling anybody he was racing these bikes. That's one of, that's what my dad personally believes that we never got the story that he pity parachuted, had a hidden motorcycle and rolled it out. That's my dad's personal theory. So, you know, all this stuff comes down and, and many years later, uh, the statute of limitations is up and all of a sudden this guy starts collecting a, a pretty good assortment of toys from shotguns to four wheelers to motor homes. My Dad's known him his whole life.

Speaker 5:          02:07:20       He knows what the guy does for a living. He knows what his wife does and he, what the heck's going on here, you know, how come, where are you getting all this money? And the guy says, well, you know, I'm an Indian. And, and uh, when you reach a certain age, you get some Indian money and there's some truth to that. There is Indian money that's given out. Uh, if you're, uh, if you're a native living in America, but you're talking about like $1,800 a year and when you get older, about three grand a year, this guy came into it. Why the assortment of money? Well, the sketches came out of DB, Cooper and it's a spitting image of the guy. That picture that we looked at. Yeah. It's just, wow. There was different ones of him in the disguise with the mustache and the whole bit, but they're going, hey, wait a minute.

Speaker 5:          02:07:57       This looks just like you. So, uh, you know, one night my aunt asks him, they're there. They're at dinner, they're all family friends. My parents were there. My aunt and uncle are there. This guy and his wife were there. My aunt looks across the table and flat out says, are you DB Cooper? And he said, no, but the way that he said no, told everybody there that he was, and they never brought it up again ever now is it came out and my uncle asked him a little bit in private, Hey, well, you know, that other night we were having some Chinese food and you, well my, my parents and uncles weren't the only one that thought he was the government did to. So the FBI had visited this guy than he even moved away for a while. I went to Arizona and then slowly came back.

Speaker 5:          02:08:40       Uh, but you know, he was talked to by the FBI. I thought he was DB Cooper as well. So when my dad was on his deathbed, uh, you know, we, he and I had, uh, you know, you ask me whatever you want, I'll ask you and I'll tell you how the story really happy. You know, it's a bit of a fun moment, uh, between father and son. Everybody leaves the room and say, hey, Dan were really happened that night when you came in at 2:00 AM smelling like Bourbon. You know, whatever really happened that day. The principal called and claim that you and your friends are. So we kind of go back and forth and I asked him flat out is Blah Blah Blah db Cooper. And my dad said, well all the evidence is saying that he is, your uncle believes that your aunt believes in your mom believes it. I don't think he had the courage. I don't think he was. So my dad's final ruling on his deathbed was no, he, he said he wasn't. But uh, he's DB Cooper.

Speaker 2:          02:09:30       I know. Real input. Absolutely. There was another, a theory that DB Cooper was a serial killer. That he was a guy who, uh, had killed his family. I believe it's even fun that, what are you looking at Ted coopers as it some checkers claiming? How is he looking this up so fast? It's like you are, I have the thought and he's got it on the screen and nimble fingers. That's very impressive. A few, but I tell them to give you a massage. They don't put in the book. He goes, listen, I can't put it in a book. If you want to say the guy's name, go Mike, my father's store. I can't, you know, I can't do it. I can't do it. It's pretty God damn good story. That's one of those rare folklore type stories and it just gets passed on and on and nobody got jumped in Washington state.

Speaker 2:          02:10:08       You know the jump DB Cooper high end. He jumped and watch the guy lived in Oregon. That's where he went. So you lived in Oregon most of your life? Yeah, I'm still there. Big Foot. Yes or no? Well, absolutely. Yes really. But you know, the big foot makes it sound like you're some conspiracy theories. I believe there are Sasquatch. Uh, and I believe this because people that I believe in trust, including a doctor has said, look, I know where they are. And it's very hard. Yeah. He says it's hard to get to and he's got this plane, it's got this big grand plan. He's a survivalist because this whole plan lined up about how we can get to him and his personal belief and you know, it's just a theory, but he lives in that park is big foot's supposed to be from the northwest. He lives in those hills where all these big foot stories come from and he's like, look, it's not a big foot like at some wild monster living out there.

Speaker 2:          02:10:52       I believe there is a, a pack of family of Sasquatch there just haven't been discovered. We haven't photographed and learned about them. I believe there's an entire tribe of these big foot. Wow. Come. Nobody's done nothing. No good pictures. All the pictures are full shit. All the stories have holes in them. Oh, tremendously. Tremendously. Never watched finding big foot or anything. I do. I'm embarrassed to admit to you that that I think there is a Sasquatch. Should we, you know, cause I know the kind of people that, that, that, that I'm asking because you lived up there and that's where most of the southern California when they talk about the bodies, but the truth is what bodies do you ever find, you know, bears are out there, kind of are out there. Do you ever walk through the forest and find bear carcasses? Coyote, you know, you sure don't end to your point, there's a number of hoaxes.

Speaker 2:          02:11:35       There's a number of guys dressed up in a stupid outfit that you could buy any Halloween run through. Those buddy records it and they stick it on the Internet. I get that there's hoaxes but there is some pretty good footage. You know, you said there was none. There's a very good footage. Matter of fact, I've done a lot of work in the movie business and and, and stunts and stuff. And this topic comes up on Hollywood sets and these are the best guys on earth for designing things to look like humans. And they've said that there is one video where as he moves the muscles in the body apartment and stunt coordinators and makeup and costume people in Hollywood say there is no costume created to do that. Okay. They don't all say that. Some of, I would love to hear what you, some of them do say that and I think they're idiots.

Speaker 2:          02:12:21       And I think if you look at that, that's a man and a fucking monkey suit. It's not even a good monkey suit. And the man who did it look up the Patterson big foot footage. Um, the Guy Patterson was a con artist. Not only was a con artist, he was arrested for writing a bad check to buy the very camera that made that video. Oh God damn. And another guy. Conveniently what we're looking for big phobia, embarrass video. If you, if you break this right in front of me, cause I've looked into this too because I live in that area, I believe in, right. It fascinating. I believe it's very possible. You know, one of the reasons why I believe it's possible because Jane Goodall said it's positive it yes. This is exactly kind of monkey suit, bro. That doesn't even look good. It looks stupid. Look at his big fat, stupid fucking shirt as on big hairy fucking shirt and big stupid looking shoes. That's a terrible monkey suit. And he's just hunching over. Looks good to me, Eh. Come on and looks good to me. They should have again. There's other ones, Brian, that have been a level c. That's the, um, that's the footage of him falling down. Some people have said to through computers there, there you go. There you see a better, it's a better video of it. I, no, no, we just saw it back then. You would just, you just had it in the middle. It's a better now again, I do want to be clear before

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       I become the conspiracy theorists. That's what it is. I'm sorry. The beginning of his zoom, zoom put, there's one monster. I believe that there's a seminar and it's, you know what? I was told this by a guy that I tried. That's how everything, they want. Many ass fucking legs. I got a ton is not, that's so stupid. You're making a pretty darn good case right now. I'm going to have to say I, I'm starting to rethink that, but this is video ours. Come on. Look how dumb that looks. It's got tits to, what's that? They have double ds. Za is I what grills have get the fuck outta here, bitch. That's fake. That's fake as fuck. I have a good fake meter and it just looks at that thing I look at. It's big stupid looking shoes that he's wearing. Those aren't feet. Get outta here. That's a fucking monkey suit and it's not even a good one. They took a video of a guy. The guy just so happened to be out there looking for Sasquatch and Oh, I fell off my horse and immediately why I had my camera ready. We saw the big foot to strolling along. Not a care in the world. Ooh,

Speaker 5:          02:14:33       make sure in fairness that if we dissect that video when we, when we decided that dice that that video is garbage. That doesn't make

Speaker 1:          02:14:40       the whole theory garb. Know people do. I do not not believe in big foot. And one of the reasons why is because where the, the area where this most Sasquatch sightings are is right at the end of the Bering strait and between Alaska and the northern coast of the United States, or the, excuse me, the Northwestern coast of the United States, that's where all of the Sasquatch sightings, the huge majority of them were for a long time. They started spreading out all throughout the country. And who knows how many of them are bullshit. The numbers weird, but the American Indian had to, the American Indians had over 200 different names for Sasquatch or 20 some, some of the two something with it to a bunch of them. And they don't have like a lot of mythical animals. They, this was a, this was a real thing that they thought lived amongst people and it's a real animal that used to actually live. If you follow the Bering Strait in Asia, it's called gigantor. Pythagoras was an eight foot tall, like good annunciation. You're out a huge big foot. It was essentially bigfoot is the exact animal, you know.

Speaker 5:          02:15:38       Now I want to tie this school of thought that you know, I said, yeah, I think there's a Sasquatch. You said, and then we both agreed on this video. We have different opinions of the video. However, if we prove the video one way and my favorite or yours, it doesn't, it doesn't prove the answer to our, our original thesis, which is is there a big foot? And you see this, this flaw, this pitfall is we like to call it in human thinking. When it comes to alien encounter, how many times have we seen somebody that says, Hey, guess what? I was abducted by aliens and I was given a special power. In fact, approve it. I'm going to go ahead and make that light turn off by sitting in my chair and not touching it. And that will prove to you that I was abducted by aliens and given this power.

Speaker 5:          02:16:17       So now I sit here, I make that light turn off. Okay, I've got a power to turn that light off. But having that power does not prove that I was given that power by being abducted by aliens. But there's a pitfall in human thinking and oftentimes you can get people to believe one thing, one way or the other. They can then connect that to a completely isolated and separate incident, which is, which is what, I don't want to happen with the video because I'm realizing right now I'm looking like a real doofus after looking at that video, I don't need to get my, my evidence together and come back.

Speaker 4:          02:16:46       Got Video was actually not only was it proven a hoax, but the guy who played big foot wound up confessing. So, uh, yeah. Or is that the conspiracy? That could be good. It could be just a guy who look, anytime there's some sort of a serial killer, people will come out of the woodwork to clinic. Like the DB Cooper thing, the same thing. People were full of Shit. There people are crazy. Absolutely. But that just stinks to me. I look at it, it looks stupid. I hear people to experts talk about, I'm like, bitch, what are you talking about? That doesn't even look remotely real. It's just it looks dumb. And the way it was created as the, the just the odds of this guy finding it and no one else has gotten a good photo of it. But that doesn't mean that it can't be real.

Speaker 4:          02:17:25       If you fly over the Pacific northwest and you see how dense that part of the world is. People, I don't think a lot of people really truly understand the, the amount of acreage of really almost impassable rain forest to deal with. And the Pacific northwest, when you fly over these areas where these people are talking about sightings and they don't just have sightings, by the way, they also have real sound effects. These sounds that are at some sort of primate that's screaming out and they've sent these things to experts. You know, people were just trying to detect hoaxes, you know, and these people that have been on camping and hunting trips recorded these things and these are primate noises. They don't know what the fuck it is, but it's a primate noise. And one of the guys, and I think he's a real credible guy that has had an encounter, is uh, Les Stroud.

Speaker 4:          02:18:12       You know the survivor man, that guy was staying in Alaska. He was doing one of those survivor things in Alaska and he said that he was asleep and he was a inside is 10 or trying to sleep. And in the middle of the night he heard primate noises. He heard primate noises in the woods near him and he got out of his bed to try to look and he heard just something running and crashing through the trees when it hurt him. And to this day he has no idea what the fuck it could be. It could. He said it couldn't have been a bear. He goes, it was very clear. Primate type noise, something along those lines. Something that's just not a bear and whatever the fuck it was. He said it was enormous. It might be possible if there's, it's, there's enough dense forest that there might be just a few animal.

Speaker 4:          02:18:58       I mean try finding a Fox. Good luck. Should go try to find a Fox because I do have a day I was driving in studio city, I saw a coyote. This motherfucker just wandering around Cutco. Try find a coyote in the wild. Could you just go, go look for one. And there's millions of those cunts. Coyotes are everywhere. To live in the Pacific northwest to be a primate, it might be possible of evolution. So you're talking about a Sasquatch. You're talking about a derivative of a human. So you're, you've got to assume that there are a little bit more intelligent than say a coyote. If it's hard to find a coyote is can be very hard to find a Sasquatch.

Speaker 5:          02:19:28       If it's true. I mean, I'm just fueling the fire again. I don't want to come up with a gun. I believe it cause the guy happened to trust just says, look, I think it's true. And so I'm choosing to believe him more than I believe the evidence. How many people do you know that? I've seen one me at zero, zero. A zero. Even the guy I trust has never claimed that he's seen what he just said. Look, I've looked at the MSI. Just think they are. I think that there

Speaker 1:          02:19:48       Goodall, she's a monkey expert. She said a hundred percent really hundred percent sun. Why you shaking your head? You don't think so? No. What do you think now? What's the number? You think the whole thing is bullshit.

Speaker 5:          02:20:00       But that goes back to the alien and counter. You get people who used to work at the Pentagon and NASA that combat and claims there's aliens, you know, Corso and, and again, it's a, it's a flaw in human thinking because the guy works at NASA. What NASA has got 3,800 desk. You don't think a crazy person can get a desk there. Every now and then the same thing goes for the Pentagon. I used to work at the Pentagon. The Pentagon is never employed. A mad man. Get outta here. Right? You can show me an alien, you know, show me in it. Don't, don't give me a of a pitfall in human thing. I actually covered this in my book. It's on page 92 in the voice of reason. I talk about human pitfalls and it's why we're able to believe such outlandish and crazy things. Do you remember a year or 2000 y two K we all went into a panic state home with water I water and canned foods. I stayed in as well. I didn't have my supplies. I should have. I was a college. I didn't have money for what? For the water. Canned foods, but yeah. You know, we all buy into it and it's, it's this hysteria with no evidence. Real loose evidence.

Speaker 1:          02:20:53       2012 December 21st end of the Mayan calendar. That's another one. Huh? Except recently they found newer versions of the Mayan calendar that they a had never discovered before that were more complete that go far past December 21st it's 10 year, 10 more years of moneymaking. Yeah. You know what I mean? You got 10 more years of Paul and son. How you feel about that?

Speaker 5:          02:21:14       No. Thank you for that line. You'll finally contributed today's show. Besides setting the whole thing on. Nice to see you pipe in over there. You look like an intelligent guy. You just haven't said much to them.

Speaker 1:          02:21:24       Do you think he looks like he's an intelligent guy? I was. It was really saying chill son and he knows how to read a map right up right up until that,

Speaker 5:          02:21:30       but he got all these wires, man. I know he's, I know he's done something today that we couldn't, it

Speaker 1:          02:21:34       got an odd form of intelligence. It's true. What would you describe it as? What? Why do I sent meant and meant by that? My encounter is that it was Tim or years for the people that are behind the whole thing to make more money to say, oh, we said 2012 we met in 2022 there's a what books? There's fucking products. Why do you remember that one? When we had Pinchbeck end and he's like convinced that something's happening. It's like anytime you're convinced of anything, I'm like, what? You know it's going to go down to come me is falling apart right before our eyes. It can rebound. I said it hasn't been around a long time. Exactly. Yeah. It kind of flexible. Isn't there a bunch of people like fucking with it right now and trying to put it back together again? You think they're not gonna be able to figure out why they figured it out in the first place? And do you even barely understand it? Cause I barely do. Or watch the stock market scroll across my screen. It might as well be Mayan Hieroglyphs. Right. I don't know what the fuck that means. Do you know what any of that stuff means? No. Yeah, and yet the ones without us.

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       Yeah. No, I, the bottom line is relaxed. You know, it'll, it'll, it'll work itself out. Yeah, things might get tough, but how spoiled are we anyway, you know, I, I always hear these debates on education. It's like, well look, when my father went to school that wasn't all that long. And I'm like, great grip. My father, just my dad, when he went to school and high school, if you went for four years, you graduated, that was it. There were not standard setting. You must pass this class. You've got to have Algebra and you've got to have geometry. And you got, if you'll show up for four years, you'd get a degree. And you know, back in the olden day, there was no first grade, second grade, third grade, they all went to school together. Everyone in the neighborhood showed up to the same school and the teacher taught them all.

Speaker 5:          02:23:01       And those are the same people that have now built our bridges and our churches and brought US technology and evolved into Steve Jobs and apple and Microsoft and Bill Gates and these wonderful things. So apparently the education system, uh, it doesn't necessarily need this great revamping. I mean, before we even had textbooks and computers, people were learning and people were doing great things in this country. So, you know, we, we've gotten so spoiled and we've turned week, you know, we've, we, we become feminized and our masculinity is gone and a lot of things such as having gritten digging deep, and if the economy sucks and you got to find a better way and you've got to cut back, then that's what you gotta do. But Grin and bear it. You don't, you don't go build a, a, a hole in a cave somewhere and wait for the end of the world man up.

Speaker 4:          02:23:45       Well, one of the issues with, you know, trying to get by in today's society and bringing your kids into schools is that there's a lot of fucking people out there that have done a real shitty job of raising kids are real shitty job. And when you put your kids around them, your kids are in danger and there's liabilities and there's all kinds of bullying and stupid shit that goes on and crime. And if you can't figure out a way to get your kids out of those situations, they never even have a chance to let the system work on them. A big part of what school is, is sending your kid to some sort of an awkward fucking prison that they're stuck at for many hours a day. Especially if you lived in any sort of economically compromise situation. And he'd sort of place where there's a lot of poor people, any place where there's a lot of people that are down and out and there's a lot of fucking shitty parents and you've got to go to school and deal with gang bangers and all kinds of other craziness while just trying to stay alive, trying to stay healthy.

Speaker 4:          02:24:44       Fuck learning. Good luck. Half this country. Good fucking luck. Trying to learn something in public school and how much energy is a, our politicians putting on that. How much has anybody changed, uh, budgets where they're enhancing school budgets and paying teachers much more trying to make it commiserate for what it's worth. Make it commensurate rather for what it's worth. Like, like, like, like a doctor. Like having a, a, a good teacher is just as important as having a good doctor. You're having someone that develops the way you fucking think about life, not just shows you information that you need to memorize for some stupid fucking tests that you're not going to absorb anything out of. They show you how to think. They show you how to live your life.

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       They show you good examples of people who have lived quality lives and they get you to think and pattern your thoughts in a certain direction. And most kids aren't even getting that today. Most kids are getting a shit fucking experience in public school. That's what the problem is. Sure. People need to man up. Absolutely fucking for sure. But that comes, it also comes with having kids and raising your fucking kids and being a man in the first place, raising your kids properly and correctly. Well, how many people are doing that, man? It's a small percentage. It may be 30% let's put a number on it. Let's go crazy and say it's 30% that means you're dealing with 70% possible fuck ups. And not every kid that comes from a fucked up household becomes an asshole. But God damn, a lot of them do. How many times did you have to deal with kids in high school and in college even?

Speaker 2:          02:26:10       There were just a fucking mess all the time. And it was always because of the way they grew up, it would always cause their brother fucked them over. Their parents fucked them over, nobody paid attention to them. And that poor asshole just gets jutted into the school system and as to fucking figure out his own way to the surface of the water. That's the problem. It is partly because people are weak and sissified in this country, but it's also because the system is run by cunts. The system is run by a bunch of greedy cons. Don't pay attention to the most important resource. This country has its children the most important research. You wanna have a a great, powerful country. You've got to have a smaller percentage of losers and how do you have a smaller, smaller percentage of losers? We have to go into the fucking places where there's the most losers economically and help those fucking kids.

Speaker 2:          02:26:53       Joe, you are on fire right now. I'm a sociologist is what I got my degree in. You aren't fire right now. You're saying this in a simple manner, but this is actually very deep. You know, the first time I ever came to one of your comedy shows, you know, I went through school, I went and got certified smart. I sit in on lectures, I've written papers, I read every book and get my hands on. I left your first comedy show. I've never thought more than I than I did at your show. And I thought, I can never tell him that or he's going to grow. You're listening to a high comedian that, you know, I'm going to look like a fool if I tell him this, but I couldn't disagree with you more. But you know, when you say very simple things like marijuana has never killed anybody and 14 people died last year cause coconuts fell on their head. We're not, we're not making coconuts illegal. I can't help but look at that and have to think and rethink my stance. You know? And I'm like, I don't, I don't want to agree with Joe. I'm on the right. He's on the left. I don't like this. But why don't I like it? Because he's making a damn good point. And what you just said could be two or three chapters in any social logical book and you are right on the money.

Speaker 1:          02:27:52       Well, I mean, I'm not on the right or the left. I'm on the right about a lot of shit among the write about guns. I'm on the right about punishment. I'm going to write about a lot of things. I'm on the left when it comes to people having fucking freedom. You know, you're a libertarian. I'm much more of a libertarian than I am a a liberal, you know, there's a lot of like social, I believe in a certain amount of social Darwinism, you know, I think, but I don't think it should ever apply to children. You know, I think if you want to be a fucking loser and you want to go out and your life and, and fuck it up, that's one thing. But think a tribe

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       protects its children, you know? And if we are anything in America, I think we are a tribe. We are a community. We're, we're one gigantic fucking tribe. And if we have any kids that are out there that aren't getting taken care of, then we're failing. We're failing. So that's our foundation. So it doesn't matter what the fuck we do at the very top of the apex with, you know, traveling to the fucking moon and working on the star wars program. That doesn't matter if our foundation is full of shit. So the, the very way our society is constructed, it's to let you know that the people running it are fools. It's like a roadmap to retardation. You see real clearly connected dots. Oh, you're just a bunch of greedy Douche bags. This is it.

Speaker 5:          02:29:04       Again, that's sociology. You're not talking psychology, you're talking sociology right now. You were the, you completely with you. If you were the president, how would you fix all this Chael Sonnen? How'd you fix this world? Well, that's such a deep question and I think about that a lot. You know, I ran, I ran for office and all that. Misstates man, I, you know, and you know who I want to be president as Brian Stan and he's got the resume, could fucking do it. He literally could become the president of the United States in a heartbeat. Yeah, absolutely. And you know, he's got a guy that corners and made John Bardis. John Bardis helped to get newt Gingrich elected. Uh, he's out of Georgia. Brian's out of Georgia. And that isn't to Brag on Newt Gingrich. What I'm, what I'm saying is Brian has the people around him that know how to do this.

Speaker 5:          02:29:43       I mean, this guy's an all American from the Naval Academy. He's a war hero. He's a sports hero and he's as squeaky clean as they come, but intelligent, articulate people love him. You know? And when I make that comment, or if he could be president, people don't understand. No, no, no. He really could be the president and he should run. And I like to throw these plugs out there. So the right amount of people pushing me. And that's how we got George Washington. It's not a job he wanted to do. People came to him and he was finally willing to do that. So anyway, I have no idea what we're even, oh, what would I do if I were the president? You know Brian Stann. Yeah, yeah. I would definitely bring Brian standing cabinet role. He, you know, he would be somebody that you would listen to a true leader of men.

Speaker 5:          02:30:22       But uh, you know, look, there's so many things that need to be done. But the first thing that I, president page as a vice president, you know what I, I would quit lion and every politician in the country from the state level to the federal level have all in the last four years, which is two cycles. If you're in the house, have all ran on the same thing, every one of them unanimously in the country, all 50 states jobs in the economy, they got to quit. No politician has ever created a job ever unless it's a state job. And don't bring up state jobs where you're taken from doers and given to non doers k you where you're taking tax dollars from hard workers and giving it to people that are in a state job. And I'm not saying those aren't important, but don't count that as as create a job. Look, if you're a lawmaker Joe, you can do two things and two things. Only tax and regulate in neither taxation nor regulation is good for job growth and they need to come clean and just say that. So you think

Speaker 4:          02:31:17       the jobs are bad for job growth there? They didn't

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       come about organically. Yeah, I just don't think you can count it. You know, when you're talking about creating jobs, what you've done is grow the size of government. So now we've got more big brother. We have more regulation, more people looking at an example of like a bullshit state job that they can create. I don't think, well, okay, let's look at the Department of Education. Let's look at the Department of Health. You know, what are these guys doing? Right? You can't get to nutritionalists to agree, you know, you can't get them to agree. [inaudible] there's so much done on nutrition, you know, and there's books written on blood type. You know, some people need more saturated fats. They love to do it. This whole thing about saturated fats that are doing it right here in California, you can't give out a happy meal if it's over 500 calories at can't include a toy.

Speaker 2:          02:31:58       They're coming down on Mcdonald's as opposed to telling parents, hey, take responsibility in regulation. Now what if your kid's an athlete? What have your kids, you know, wrestling like I had to do as a kid, I need calories and I also happened to need fat, so don't come on. I should be able to have two big MACs. And if it comes with a toy and it helps me to pull through your drive through as opposed to your competitors. That's called capitalism. And for the government to get involved as beyond inappropriate. You know, you brought up Barry bonds earlier and Mark McGuire, and I don't care what those guys did either because I don't follow baseball, but what I do care about is that government got involved. They had a congressional hearing for Congress to get involved with. Sport is beyond Riddick inappropriate. And those guys, that's what they should've said.

Speaker 2:          02:32:43       And if I was a congressman up there and my fellow congressman, it's my turn to Spock, I'm going to say shame on you and shame on you to the fellow congressmen. I'm going to say get out there and do something relevant and if people want to quit going to the ballgame, capitalism will fix that sport and nothing else. Exactly. The market will dictate where that's silly sport is and it's a self regulating sport to, they choose to agree on what is in the contract. There's a reason why the NBA doesn't test for marijuana because everybody would be tested positive. Those dudes are blaze to the gills. So it's not like, well we're going to eliminate all illegal aspects of any basketball game. No, they have shit they agree on and shit they don't agree on and they put things in contracts just to make sure that they can, you know, they can, they, they, they, they, each side enforces their point.

Speaker 2:          02:33:28       But it's, it's a lot of, it is ridiculous. Completely redid in congregational here. Congress, you're going to sit down with the people that are involved at the highest level of our government and you're going to debate the, hit the ball with the stick game. Sure. Oh the guys too good at it. He's taken some extra chemicals and it makes them really good at, they hit the ball with a stick game and those little kids that are watching at home, I'm going to be real disappointed man. You have to find out that that guy took some extra stuff that makes them better at, they hit the ball to stick game, right? The fuck man. No, I think, I think it's, I think it's shameful. I think it's shameful that Congress got involved in that and I think you know, to call a congressional hearing, they call it under a number of ridiculous things.

Speaker 2:          02:34:05       They call it on the poor guy from BP because they got an oil leak out in the ocean and that's horrible and I don't want to see the ocean and get a leak, but I assure you BP who's making money doesn't want to see a leak either. They want to see that taken care of. They want to get that cleaned up. They want their shareholders happy. Well, it actually really can. The BP case, if they had actually cut corners to save money and made a shotty product, that was a real fucking disaster. That's a different situation. That's a company that was, you know, they're, they're responsible for that. We fucked up. You didn't build the, the uh, there, there's two different ways to build that valve and they didn't build the, they took a shortcut to make it to and make it happen quicker and they didn't, they'd been warned about that too.

Speaker 2:          02:34:42       That was a fucking tremendous disaster. We had members of Congress calling to going on on shows and telling pundits, hey, listen, we need to get the military out there. Now of course, they don't say what the military is going to do. We don't have, what's the military? They're going to shoot it. They're going to shoot it. The oil and what do they possible they were talking about dropping into congress. Somebody was talking about dropping a nuke and closing them. That's how they're going to close off the oil. Drop a nuke on it. It's ridiculous. You know, and then you imagine what that would look like and the British guy and just dolphins and whales flying into the fucking sky. Right. Have you ever seen the video, the photograph of that? Uh, the bomb that they blew off in the ocean Brion pull that picture up.

Speaker 2:          02:35:20       Its nuclear tests, Ocean Pacific, something. It was incredible. I don't know what year this was. It was a long time ago, but the, the, the actual explosion from this nuclear bomb that they dropped in the ocean, the, the water was so much bigger than they thought it was going to be. The set all these battleships around it, like they were going to monitor this thing and see what the impact was. The battleships just flock to get flown sideways. It's like miles high water, straight up into the air. It's incredible. Why we're waiting for the video. I'm going to play it. Just a photo. The one up game and I don't want up you, I'm going to come in second here, but I want to, I want to relate. I had a friend that had to do two years in a military prison because when he was in Iraq during the war of 92 weight, way back, but it was in my neighborhood, he shot a camera with a law and a law is a rocket launcher.

Speaker 2:          02:36:10       So they're out in the desert. They got nothing to do with camel goes by and he shoots his thing. So you're talking about wanting to see pictures. I don't like that the camel had to give his life. And you know as, as the rumor goes there, they're quite coveted it over there. I don't, I don't say this to be a disingenuous or denigrate it, but I'm told you and you can even marry one over there. Whether that's true or not, I don't know. But it's that serious. He shot him with a rocket launcher. Oh, I don't want that port Campbell to have to die. But I do want to see that if there was a video or a footage and my buddy had to do the guy, my neighborhood has to go to military prison for two years. I at least need to see what happens when a rocket meets a camel in the desert.

Speaker 2:          02:36:43       What did, why did they put them away for so long? Two years along? Ask. Extremely disrespectful. I mean you're really talking about offending people in that part of the Adobe can see what you don't understand that I don't, I don't get anything. I was Campbell, I watched one of those, Anthony Bordain shows those reservation shows where they cooked to Campbell. They board the Kamma cooked it. Yeah, they'll slow cooked it underground. It's like whoa, green a camel. I didn't even know they ain't camels. I guess when you're stuck out there and there's nothing but Campbell's you've got to make do. But he's like, it was like a special dish that they would only have like certain times I was in trouble cause I

Speaker 5:          02:37:16       talked about the people in the streets of a nuisance in Brazil eating monkey. Well it's true. They do and it's like, listen now before you think I'm making funny, you might want to know what we put in hot dogs right here at Yankee Stadium here in America when we, some pretty weird stuff too, but it happens to be a true story that they do eat monkey in Brazil. But the point that I'm getting at is they eat weird stuff around the world, man. And I think I personally like it when I travel, I like to try some of that weird. I don't want to eat. I eat pig intestines and Turkey, but I didn't know that's what I was eating. I think the mere word intestine as disgusting and I was pretty upset when I found out I did. You never let snail like s card.

Speaker 5:          02:37:50       Yeah, I've have had escar go on a cruise ship as a kid. My Dad tricked me. I don't like it. I do like caviar and now that I've gotten older, I didn't like it as a kid, but when the Russians come over like four for a wrestling or dual meter, even the Russian fighters, they all bring caviar that you can trade with them. Try and give me money. I give you caviar, but is worth a lot of money. Their caviar, Russian caviars, the most famous kind of caviar. It's kind of like a Cuban cigar. If you can get ahold of Russian caviar, especially back with the USSR before the breakup of the Soviet Union, it was almost impossible to get Russian caveats, one of those. So we deemed it to be a little better than it actually is, but it is coveted. If you can get it. It says Russia on the label, you'll be the hit of your

Speaker 1:          02:38:29       neighborhood party. It's like, yeah, like you said, like Cuban cigars. I've always thought it was weird that it's an acquired taste. It's so expensive and it's an acquired taste. Like why would you want to acquire a taste for something that's really expensive that initially don't like? Sure.

Speaker 5:          02:38:43       Take it tastes like salt. You know? I haven't like, cause now they, they've eased us into it cause they, they roll all of our local Sushi rolls in a type of caviar real cheap, that yellowy stuff. But you know, I've learned to like it as we've gotten older. They go on these gentlemen, tell people that I have American loves caviar, Russian caviar and anything else wrapped his pitch up, bring it home. I mean I had a great time. I got to tell you to find a really good time. I learned some things about you today. You're not just that pothead comedian. I thought you went there. Uh, he got second amendment and some deep thoughts and, and you know, whether you know it or not, you're a sociologist. Listen to some of your arguments today, whether you've been certified in it, like I, you know, went to school or not. You're a sociologist and I admire that.

Speaker 1:          02:39:23       Well, I'm gonna just a stand up comedian. I think as extent of comedian, you have to understand human beings to understand yourself in order to move forward, to advance, to evolve. You've got to understand human beings. You've got to understand yourself. You know, I just, uh, my observations is just a part of life. Cool. Just like yours. Just like your book VIP pass in alignment with the first part of it. Voice of reason. The Voice of reason, which you can get right now on Amazon. You could just go if you have a candle and get it and you should get a kindle because they're fucking awesome.

Speaker 5:          02:39:51       They are great insight about my mom's, my, my mother's Day present. I just said her kindle book now. I could just send her books now. Yeah. That's cool. Yeah, that is a great service and it's amazing.

Speaker 1:          02:40:03       Battery lasts forever. I have a kindle. The battery lasts forever. It looks great. It looks like printed word. You could even like make the print larger or smaller. Like me, I'm going blind so I have to make the print larger, so

Speaker 4:          02:40:13       it's amazing. It's an amazing product. I have an IPAD and I'll, I'll, I'll watch books on that too. I liked the effect more the scrolling, but it's better on the eyes. The kindle, I think the kindle, so superior device, it's the shape. I like audio. I love audio books if they're red. Well, but every now and then, like I, I bought a steep couple of Stephen King books that were written or read by Stephen King. Those are fucking terrible. Roger, Roger Gilbertson. He shouldn't have done it. Roger. He's kidding. That's a bad joke. The guys got to know John. I know. Don't don't do that. That's a bad Karma. Takes you out of JFK. I was at the Tom likesure. Why can they, should they go? Yeah. How rude. How rude. Anyway, that's the end of this show. Ladies. Gentlemen, if you want to follow chail on Twitter, it's Suning c h.

Speaker 4:          02:41:03       How did you get that one? Why not just chill son and I didn't know much about Twitter when I set it up. I bet they could change it. Yeah. And I wish, I wish it was, has somebody else told me the marketing the UFC to go up to that. Now it's just somebody's got it. Unless it's an actual Chael Sonnen, you know, which I doubt how many channels on do you ever met him? I've met a few Joe Rogan's no chill sentence. And so it's an unusual, you get that shit on Twitter. That's Sun NCH. Yeah. And you say tell the UFC to go out. What does UFC have? Every department who do I could, I called Twitter department. Go after that call Donna, I'll call Donna. Joe said go head of department. I met, I met someone. I bet whoever has the the chill son and he would probably be happy to give it to you. Hey, hey douche bag. Who you squatter, stop. Stop hiding and holding on to Charleston instinct. Just give the password. Well I take it from what I could just stare at.

Speaker 4:          02:41:50       It would actually, it wouldn't work that way because you want to get all your followers and bring them over there. How many followers you got? I got 152,193 not, not that I keep track or a camp. You can't not have that. So that's, you've got to have to figure out a way to get Twitter to merge the two they did with me. I had a different nick. I had a different Twitter name and they merged it and made it Joe Rogan. Oh, excellent. Yeah, I think I bought it. I bought it. No, I bought my space. I bought my mind nick over at tap out his friends with the creator of Twitter, so maybe we can put him on that. Maybe we can to him. Go after it and let's make it happen. All right, so it's sun and ch for now on Twitter. Um, and uh, thank you to everybody that tunes in.
