Speaker 1:          00:00:05       He,

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       before we even get started, I got to give a shout out to this dude, Aaron, where is it? Where's the, uh, not that, but he gave us that. But the other thing, the white snake, oh, there it is. I told the story a long time ago about a car accident and I got into when I had a, I had an older girlfriend. He's telling me what to do, which is pretty hot though, Stephanie, how are you? Um, and she, uh, she made me throw away this whitesnake cassette after the car accident. I had a little box of cassettes in my car and she said, throw that out and that's fucking listen to her. All right. So if you're in that state, if you're in that situation right now, will your interrelationship and the person you're with tells you what to do and you go, fuck man, I'm that bitch. Why was that bitch wants to, and I was bummed out, man, that I fucking threw out this whitesnake cd wells cassette cassette, rather they would, I didn't even have a CD player then that. When did they, when did cds come out? Officially

Speaker 3:          00:01:02       90, 80. I feel like we've done 88

Speaker 2:          00:01:06       trying to figure this out before. We just don't, it's just not worthy enough. Somewhere in the 80 [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:01:10       yeah, early or late eighties, I would say. Cause I got my first one in, I remember for my birthday when I was like 16 or something like that. 17. So this had to be

Speaker 2:          00:01:19       b, a d eight. Cause I know that after I broke up with her, I started fighting again. I took like a break, we broke up and then I have three more fights after a date of her. So, uh, like kickboxing fights. So I remember the year, uh, so I'd had to be Ada, which is 88 or 89. But fucking, I loved this cassette. So that was, that was like a real moment of for me. You know, there's moments when you haven't relationships where you'd go, fuck, I can't be this guy. I can't, I can't just let someone tell me what to do. And someone tried to change me. Like she was a very smart girl and she was older than me. Like she was 25 and I was 21. And I remember, you know, she was just smarter than me. It lists, it's certainly at the time more worldly than me and uh, I just fucking listen to her. It's not good man.

Speaker 3:          00:02:14       Don't you hate when you see your friends in those situations though? Like you see the friends that are, that always fight every week and they're always breaking up in there.

Speaker 2:          00:02:22       Yeah, it's awful. In her defense, I was a fucking idiot in her defense, so I, she was trying to shape me up, you know, it was an interesting like, you know what I knew I couldn't hang out with her anymore, was um, there was an incident at a comedy club that I've told before. I don't want to repeat it again because the person that I talked about, like [inaudible] talked about it in the Jamie Kilstein podcast, the person I was talking about is completely delusional and their perception of these events, I don't want to even rehash who the original person was that I'd gotten this dispute with, but I wound up walking off the stage because I was disgusted by how this professional comedian was censoring people at an open mic night. And um, Stephanie, who's, by the way, awesome. Never anything but awesome. She was very cool person.

Speaker 2:          00:03:10       So I've never hated her or anything, but she, you know, she pulled me aside and she like Kinda like lectured me. She's like, look, if you want to do this, if you want to do this, then you have to really do it. You can't walk off stage like that. That's completely unprofessional. And I'm like, I'm not a professional. I'm like, I'm an amateur. Like, yeah, it's unprofessional. I'm trying to learn how to do it. And then I realized like that's not how you talk to people that are in your life, that if you don't like what they're doing, like you have, there's, there's gotta be a better way of approaching it than that. Her way of approaching it was from like a mother perspective, I can authoritative perspective, you know, it was weird. It was a weird relationship in that respect. And when you see those relationships, the problem is not, I don't want to generalize, but oftentimes in relationships, the dynamic that the relationship begins with is the dynamic the relationship sticks with.

Speaker 2:          00:04:04       And if you get stuck in a relationship where one person is telling you what to do, it very rarely goes back the other way. And then you tell them what to do and then they listened. It never does. It's like you develop like a chief and the rest of the Indians, you know there's a captain and then there's the sailors and it's just the way it is. Man. I don't know why, but with her, like early on she assumed the role of the one who is like dictating what was okay and not okay, what kind of music I should like, how I should dress. It's real weird man. But again, she wasn't a bad person. She was a 25 year old girl dating a 21 year old guy who was crazy. And you know, when girls are 25, they're like, okay, what am I doing? Am I going to marry this guy? I'm going to have kids with this fucking idiot.

Speaker 3:          00:04:50       I got to shape them up. I've got to get them to stop listening to white snake. I mean, I think I do that every almost every relationship though. Like oh yeah, she uh, you know, and then coincidentally you often dig, always great girls younger than you. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Always and never fixable. Like as hard as I tried. Not that fix of all

Speaker 2:          00:05:12       21 to 25 is, um, it doesn't seem that old, like for a guide. What girl? And again, I don't like to generalize, but I definitely think that girls mature quicker than guys. 100% oh yeah. I think that's common knowledge, right? Well, I've been trying to figure out why. I've been trying to figure out what it is. Parents, man. No, I think it's ego. I think it's ego. I think men have spent so much time coddling the male ego worried about this. Fuck, go fuck kicked. This guy's us. You know? Fuck that guy up. Like posturing and presenting themselves like especially when they're really young as something better than they actually are. It's like a big part of being a young man until you realize somewhere around your thirties I guess that nobody buys that. Like nobody buys that. Like when you're posturing and you're pretending to be someone other than you are, you think you're giving yourself some sort of weird comfort or trying to, but it's like sucking your thumb.

Speaker 2:          00:06:10       It's not really effective. It's not really doing anything. Women don't have that. They don't have the, I'll kick your ass. They don't have the this guy. What does guy think he's going to fuck my wife? It was his gun. I think he's going to take my job was this guy thinks he's going to fucking move in next to me and put up a fucking fence in front of mark. Fuck, that's my fucking, but when men get this weird thing, man, they get this weird male thing and women don't get that thing. They get different. They get pitched things, they get, they get a, they get their own thing. You know they get the bitch at each other but it's not, this is not nearly as like physical for the most part, you know, it's much more likely that two man are going to throw bones.

Speaker 2:          00:06:50       Then two girls like when two girls fight, it's like Holy Shit. They went for it. They like physically trying to claw each other's eyes out and usually at least one of them is out of their fucking minds. If you get two girls, obviously not talking about martial arts competition, but if you get two girls involved in a street fight, at least one of them is out of their fucking mind. He said the best like to sane dudes under the right conditions with alcohol involved could beat the shit out of each other. It's very possible, very possible, especially with alcohol involved, but two girls pulling hair and club, I would venture the vast majority of women out there have never been in a fistfight because vast majority, 80% yeah, I think that's a good number. I think 80% of kid number, it's probably not right. So they, I think they're, they're, you know, they have different, different things going on and I think even if they want to be respected and they want to be appreciated, it's not the same as like the male thing, the male wanting to be respected, especially our young men. It's very difficult to get over just the natural monkey instincts that boys have. Just those natural monkey instincts. There's so God damn distracting. That I think is maybe this is just the theory, not even biologically why women be sure in general faster than men. It might just be this, the lack of the struggle with that male ego.

Speaker 3:          00:08:24       Yeah. Brian and I talked to him about it. Yeah. Is it? Do you ever have male instincts to like buy a girl's neck when you're having sex with her like that, that kind of, that seems like you'd be somebody that would be like a neck bite or you'd be really into it and just go,

Speaker 2:          00:08:39       do you not want you beaten off? Thinking about how I fun so I will stop this conversation right here. It's, you know what, it's, it's different with different girls, right? Isn't it? With different girls you dated. Some girls like to get choked. They just do.

Speaker 3:          00:08:54       I hate all that. When a girl tells me to slap him or choke him, that's the word. I can't do it. I'm not going to beat you up and going to have to get that from somebody else. You're going to have to call her Ari. Do you think the daddy thing, there's something there. When girls are like, fuck me harder daddy, when is the whole daddy thing? Do you think there's something to it? It's a dirty, yeah, it's dirty. They don't mean their dad. They mean you. They want you to be their daddy in that moment. Not even like a father, but like, like the data that's given the Dick, you know, they don't even think it's like a different word. It's a different use of the word Daddy, you know? It doesn't mean the same thing. It's like when you call someone captain, sub captain, you don't really think that guy has a boat.

Speaker 3:          00:09:34       But what if they follow me? Yeah, I told her. But the thing you say, there's one girl says it as a kid though and she doesn't talk like a kid in any other times except when she's having sex and he's like, Hey, she request is into like tolerable. Yeah. Well she dating you. Yeah. Some dark shit happened. Yeah, but see I go deeper in it. I was like, yeah, you're like daddy for school wise while you're fucking her. Yeah. Just to see you leave for school. I mean like I'm going to try to go down that path. If she brings it up, I'll see if she plays along. If she plays along, it's like fun. It's like trying to learn more about this person that I'm fucking, you know what's even more disturbing saying are you leaving for school? Cause that means it's morning sex.

Speaker 3:          00:10:18       Like the dad doesn't even have the excuse of being drunk coffee and fucks his daughter. That is God. Yeah. Just not your homework. Yeah. You need to find better people, but you know, you gotta work on yourself. Right. I know. Get your own shit in order and you'll attract people. I don't make a noise. I just don't breathe. I slobber in their hair and I don't do anything. Do you still take those pills? I, you know, I stopped at when I started sharing playing boner pills, uh, gas station, boner pills, gas station, boner pills specifically. Brian has like some gas stations picked out in the valley that he travels to have Chinese drugs in them that make your dick a totem pole. Yeah, they, they, they're very sketchy. Uh, you can go to fda.gov and see all the ingredients and all the ones that they've tested and, but I stopped doing it when I start tripping.

Speaker 3:          00:11:12       Like I, I actually saw visuals, I think I've talked about it on this, but recently they've had new packaging where they're like, holograms and like they're, they're awesome packaging. Like it's a horse running or, or, uh, like black stallion. A good one. Here's a question. How much do you think it would cost us to randomly test the gas station pills that you take and then read the results on the air? It probably have some right now that you've saved. Just packaging in my car. I say about 30 different ones in my car. But you have the packages. Okay. Set aside one package of each one that you really enjoy blacks down here right now. I want to set these aside and I want to see how much it costs. I'll go through the u s uh, the UFC labs, whatever they use. I think they use their Nevada state athletic commission I think uses quest diagnostics, but they test blood, they test blood and urine.

Speaker 3:          00:12:04       We can't do that, but we'll find out a place where we could send it to a lab to get the contents. Analog Sda has done well on, it's done it. So I'll just use, I'll use whatever guys on it's done. But FDA has done it for these ones that you're taking, do you think they're the consistent, like they're not the same every week. They change. You could tell they change their ingredients sometimes. Like I had one burst open my mouth the other day and it tastes like tea, but I've had it before where I burst open my mouth and it tasted like pills like inside of a pill, like a chemical neurol. Um, they're all powder inside. Some of them are powdered. There's the one that I had the other day was like a t, like almost like weed inside. But are any of them uh, gels, like, uh, they're all seem to be like a powder inside and, but like these new ones, like the latest one black stallion where it has like a Hologram of a horse running, uh, that one legit four days a boner solid.

Speaker 3:          00:12:55       And like, I was like really studying it the other day. Cause it's, it's, it's just like every single pocket of Shit on your Dick. It's just full. It's swollen. Like it's, it's hard though. It feels uncomfortable. Like it doesn't feel like you're normal dick, where it's like, oh this is comfortable. Super high dose of Viagra. I don't think it's my anger anymore. I think it used to be, I don't think this is by, I think this is like some kind of reaction cause it's like my dick is swollen up. Like it's got got bit by a snake. Oh it's powerful though, man. I like girls can tell immediate like, like holy shit, that's that you're killing me here. So, but when you're taking this stuff, does it go down or do you have to like deal with a hard dick for hours? It's just on call but it's ready to rock.

Speaker 3:          00:13:40       But when you wake up cars, but when you wake up in the morning it's like, it's a lot of times it's like p plus that. It's like if you fuck a girl in the morning with a p boner mixed with that at the same time she's dead. Oh poor girl. Yeah. Poor Lady. What am I talking about? This? It's hilarious. It's so weird that I do it though. And it's only like if like if I'm with a new girl, I'd be like, you know what? I'm going to really impress her tonight with this big snake venom. Dick and roses is burnout. Just that you don't want to set too to higher standard. What's embarrassing knows I collect them and, and it's, it looks like a crazy person. If you go in my car right now and if I pulled out all the ones I had in my car, it looks like a crazy, crazy. People will say, if you didn't know me think I'm crazy. Isn't that funny? That's a funny thing people do.

Speaker 3:          00:14:34       You would think I was crazy if you've paid attention to everything I do and everything I said, but if we could test him within a reasonable financial range, we should totally for cost a couple of grand or something. FDA though it really has gone through a lot of it. Most of it though, it's been steroids. Like a lot of them have had small amounts of steroids in it. And I was wondering when you were saying that you hallucinated yeah, it was a bath salts. It dude. I had to do a set, I was in um, in uh, tempe Improv or no standup live in Arizona. I was, I took some before then and I was with Tony Hinchcliffe and I was telling Tony was like, man, I don't know if I can go on stage. Like I am seeing trails right now. I had to go on stage like tripping and I talked about it on stage.

Speaker 3:          00:15:16       Like I'm sorry if I'm crazy right now. Like you guys are all like, like swirls and stuff. Like, but that's how bad it was. Like I can't see shit. So that's when I kind of stopped my fun hobby. Damn Dude, that's so dangerous. He just rolling the dice that these people in this gas station laboratory are not going to kill you. Yeah. And what's crazy, a couple of them are like, I tried to find more information about the companies that make it good luck. They don't access shadow governments in the Philippines. Yeah. Well this is my question. Like they did have an ingredients. Like is it say like you look at the package, it says what's in there? No. Well it does. It does, but you can tell it's not what it is. It's say on the package. Should have rented my car real quick and get it. A couple of kids. I've got to go get one. We're going to talk shit about you while you're gone.

Speaker 3:          00:16:06       He's so ridiculous. Do you know anybody else that takes those things? The only thing I've ever, I've taken something, not I boner pill, but I remember taking a bumblebee or black, something like that, but like I can stick a caffeine pill. Oh, okay. I can go on stage or if me and my friends, we would take him like Jack ourselves up before a concert and feel like we're going to have a heart attack. Yeah. Like, um, it was probably like rip fuel, like that kind of stuff. The Federer or something like that. It was bad for us too. We knew those were horrible for you. But see those things, at least other people were taking them. Who the fuck do you know? Pioneer gas station, boner pills and I'm going to do top, they're like David Crockett. He's setting a standard and he is just such a ridiculous thing to want to put in your body when the alternative exists.

Speaker 3:          00:16:51       Like you could go to an actual doctor and say, I have a hard time getting an erection. He'll prescribe you viagara. We all know that doesn't kill you. Maybe this is the weed of boner pills. It's easy to get. You can get it anywhere. That's true. It definitely is that you don't have to go to a doctor. Yeah, that's what I mean by that. Well, it used to not have to go to doctors for stuff. You used to be able to get things through Canadian pharmacies. Canadian pharmacies would just send new drugs. It was like the big loophole. How do people get, you can get like that nuvigil stuff. You can get free samples online or something I've seen. I don't know how you get up. Yeah. I don't know. New vigils. A little different or maybe one version of it. Provigil or Nuvigil. I know for sure.

Speaker 3:          00:17:28       I've read guys st posting on message boards saying that they bought that stuff somewhere online. I think it was the underground. Yeah, you can buy it from this like weird India set us the new one. Rhino too. This is the one with the Hologram. You're not gonna be able to probably pick that up. It's rhino 11 cause it's supposed to be 11 days at lasts 11 vulner real. Yeah. No it's not. It comes in is we look at this capsule. It comes in. This is just for the pill. It's like this weird matrix capsule. Oh Dude. How bad are these? Meanwhile look at this. It says this is hilarious. It says platinum 6,000 like as if there's some like measuring going on like what's zero platinum? 4,000 yeah. Come on. Why are you pretending you have any idea? Is people making these just thrown some shit in a bowl and mix it up while they're drunk?

Speaker 3:          00:18:18       They're not. They don't know what the fuck's in there. Platinum 6,000 fuck. These are two companies too, but that both use rhinos. Why wouldn't you use Ryan when his doctor Rhino and when is rhino 11? Well, Rhino is what those Asian people, um, believe that rhino horns give you a rank reaction. That's why they've killed so many rhinos. The reason why rhino horns or we're so much, and have you ever seen a Rhino Horn? It doesn't even make any sense. They're just gross. It's like hair. It's a giant hard like piece of fingernail or hair. Whereas like if you look at elephant tusks, you go, well I kind of get it. That's beautiful. Those are, those are amazing. Rhino horns don't look cool. They're gross looking at hill. Yeah, look at that. And so they take those things and then make some Chinese medicine. That doesn't even work.

Speaker 3:          00:19:07       It doesn't even work. I mean that doesn't make your dick hard. It's, we have viagara and they're still killing rhinos. So this actually has ingredients on it. Like Chinese daughter seed, asparagus. There's a spare gas in here. Asparagus. Why would they put asparagus? They want your penis smell different so that you really feel like something's happening. That's true. Or they just put asparagus to make it go, oh, it's healthy. It's got asparagus 10 and it has none of that. Maybe both arguments were brought up at the meeting while they were cooking up. Fuck it. Best Bathtub Meth, the Rhino 12 let's add some Kale. The problem is, man, I don't want any fucking gangsters coming out of us and trying to kill us because we out what their products are. You know, because these products are not being made by above board now folks, most likely now, and they constantly are changing their names.

Speaker 3:          00:19:58       Like if you go through my collection of these, these, these, I don't know why I keep these, but they're all different names. There's not one. That's what they have to. Aubrey was telling us what happens. This is what rb says I want. I'm probably butchering it, but Aubrey said that these people make this stuff. They put in Viagara, which they buy from some Chinese manufacturer. They take that stuff. What does, what does it Modafinil, is that what it's called? Yeah. Okay. So they buy that stuff in bulk and then they sell it for much more than it would be if they sold it. And like if you sell a prescription for like a hundred pills be x amount of dollars, but if you can stuff it into two gas station bullshit pills and sell each one for 10 bucks, like how much is a rhino to costs?

Speaker 3:          00:20:39       Well these new ones with the holograms are like $14 but they last, they do, they don't last 11 days where they definitely last a week. But if that was dessert are only two pills, if that was a bottle of Viagra, I mean $14 it wouldn't be two pills for $14 it's where they probably make like 100% more and Viagra is bitch compared to that. This, you know, like this will beat the shit out of Viagara cause this has like something that makes it, like Viagra is cool but it lasts a couple hours. It doesn't really do, it just makes you have a boner kind of. But this is like, no, you got bit by a snake boner for for awhile. Yeah, I don't. I would like to try it, but it's not worth it and when it gets you one of the best ones to do it, I found that review of some of the dangers that took rhinos seven Oh, this one right here.

Speaker 3:          00:21:22       This is all that like breakdown of all the different ingredients and whatnot of it. Oh, put that shit up. The main ingredient is called slide sill that stilled naf believed in Nashville, which is the active ingredient in Viagra. Oh, okay. Sold the Nafa, all that stuff. I would look at it. It says right to, yeah. Why did I think it was modafinil? Madame isn't modafinil or Nuvigil. Okay. That's it. If you go up a little, this is a serious side effects like headache, nausea and blurred vision. I had that blurred vision part and that's what made me stop these side effects that generally appear when using prescription ed medication. It's funny too because yet the label specifically makes the claim no headache. That's one of the primary complaints about the supplement stuff that was in it. Okay. I think her issues really make a lot of sense.

Speaker 3:          00:22:08       I guess that's what it says was in it. Yeah. Well what about what he found was in it. Okay, well we'll, we just read what it says. Go Gee extract. Dang. Sen extract, cinnamon bark, blah, blah, blah. Licorice. Bunch of Bullshit Jensen. Okay, so what's actually in it? That's really yet. I mean then he, I don't know, he didn't test it himself. Oh, it goes up and then did research on all those things and then did told you how it worked for him. Oh, so did he say it worked? Is Rhino seven work just said it's fast acting. You don't have to write back items today. Okay, well there are things that, okay. One thing I can say is I was rock hard. He says in all caps for like three days on this stuff, which is almost kind of annoying. It depends on imagine having a hard on when you have to do day to day tasks, tucking your boner into your pants and hoping it doesn't just pop out unexpectedly.

Speaker 3:          00:22:58       Yeah. Wow. So these things really are, but I see, I thought you were going to send me something where the guy actually tested it to find out what the ingredients are. That's what I'm interested in. If you're gonna have fda.gov if you could probably look up at like a couple of these different ones. I don't trust the government and their line was Bob Chem trails. The fucking line was about Dick Pills definitely makes you a lot hornier like, like horny. I seek out massages. I seek out like I like, I literally like am a hundred percent more hornier than when I'm on these though. Like almost bad almost back after you take them like the next day. Do you feel like shit? No. You feel worn out now. There's no, none of that kind of affects. Like I don't get that spokesperson for boner pills. Oh, I have a stake in these companies had an addiction to them and I spinned out of control with why don't they fucking sponsor your podcast?

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       I don't want anything to do with them anyway. Can eat sponsors. This should, this should be your first sponsor. I think on it needs to figure out what's in these things and make their own. I think anovos no, probably not a good idea. We know we don't want to be involved in any shady shit. Doctor, doctor, Brian's boner pills. It's side on it company. You could say I'm not really a doctor, but I play one on the Internet. It was fucking stethoscope on. This is Dr. Ryan. No, I just about don't just hold onto a dead Rhino's horn and actual we'll, you know, we can get that special effects guy, that guy that did the American Werewolf to make a rhino horn with blood at the bottom of it. Like you had just chopped it off like that. Oh like that? Yeah. And on the other side make it like a helmet. Like it looks like a Dick on the horn. That'd be so offensive. People would cry. They killed a fucking

Speaker 2:          00:24:38       no, just for their show. Rhinos are beautiful man. It is kind of fucked up that they get killed for that one specific reason for those horns. So weird. So it's just so weird.

Speaker 3:          00:24:52       But you know what? That Rhino, even though it looks sad that he got his horns chopped off, he's probably like, did my face is a lot lighter now. This is way better. I don't even know. He's an idiot. Yeah. Look at him. It was stupid stupid eyelashes. He doesn't know shit.

Speaker 2:          00:25:03       But did they chop his horn off to save him? Is that what they did here? Because I know they're doing some weird stuff to save. What does it say? So it just made foot boundary. Oh, farmed game. Armed Gang. Oh, an armed gang reportedly broke into the game preserve. Oh, and then cut the fucking horns off. Stole seven rhino horns from a safe. Oh, so the photo doesn't represent, does that photoshop maybe looks real either way. Um, they're doing this to elephants. They're painting their tusks pink. They're dying. The breast cases. Yes. For Awareness. For Awareness. Talk for a second. Like I write something down. I've been forgetting and I just remembered. Oh my God. Hold on one second.

Speaker 3:          00:25:53       The rhinos on these boner pills all have their horns though. So that's good. There's weird that, uh, aunts and rhinoceroses both supposedly can make boners. What? Yeah, like ants. Like if you grind up these African ants, they can also make boners. But Rhinoceros Horn doesn't work. Maybe it does. Maybe it does act. There's so many rhinos, oh, hello. Over these

Speaker 2:          00:26:19       side of that Chinese medicine stuff that just doesn't do anything. Some of it's got to work though. I mean, they were hitting mess back then when they couldn't do testing that you had a real, you had a hope that you find a guy that was completely legit. A guy who really knew how to make magic potions. So essentially what it was when they didn't have any data, no internet, no encyclopedias, no fucking medical books to call upon those, those fucking people there. There's a lot of guessing going on.

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       Not Real. It's not real sack of online thing that kind of went viral. Oh. But there's still some sort of conservation effort going on, but the pink tusk painting isn't a real thing.

Speaker 2:          00:26:55       Okay, so was it a photoshop thing or was it a hoax?

Speaker 4:          00:27:00       Both. The reports online regarding elephant Tusk being painted pink and an effort to do value the ivory poachers.

Speaker 2:          00:27:06       Well, this man, people would still take it. They'd go, dude is a pink one, is one. They tried to save site. It's, it is kind of fucked up, man. It's just, it's just such a weird, it's a weird thing that people would do to chop off a part of an animal's face to try to get their dick hard. This is, you know, it'd be one thing if there wasn't an alternative. Don't you think? If it was really awesome, you would have heard about it though. I don't know, man. I think I've, I think it might be. There might be something to it. Okay. Why don't you Google? Can Rhino Horns really give you an erection? I just put Rhino Boehner and see what he won't do it because it's his laptop. I'm not getting on a list. Not going to do this to me.

Speaker 4:          00:27:52       That can Rhino Horn other Stephen's show you what? That says, Ken Rhino Horn. Your cancer grow back regrow or what can they be used for?

Speaker 2:          00:28:01       Well, how about why you? Why you doing that? Erectile dysfunction. That's what I'm looking for. A band. If it helped you with erectile dysfunction and cancer, why Agra and species protection? Oh my God. What was that saying? It was speculative. Yeah, it's too small. What does all speculation so far, but the anti impotence, drug, Viagra, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. This bigger penis is too, I guess. Huh? Tiger Penis. That's good. Viagra, cialis or powdered raggle. Rhino Horn. Which one is the most effective? Click on that one. Above top secret. Definitely going to be legit. If it's on above top secret, especially if it's an a forum. Black helicopters. Is it possible in this day and age, 21st century. There's still men out there that honestly believe that powdered Horn of an animal that has been butchered, sometimes the arm, blah, blah, um, it has had its horn removed by a chainsaw can still be effective.

Speaker 2:          00:28:53       Cure for rectal dysfunction. Are we really still this backward? Shouldn't the medical companies that are the marketing meds that are marketing meds, which are supposed to be temporary curious for this problem, be targeting the men? Mainly Oriental, Asian racist. Wow. I'm sure who are directly responsible for the death of so many rhino or I know, isn't it the way to say it or rhinos, but it sounds better. Like you're a sophisticated, like dear so many Rhino Octopi. I'm a fan of OCTOPI. Uh, I thought that most Far Eastern countries were actually quite progressive, but they themselves are proving that they are not exclamation point. First of all, fuck phase. There's a billion people in China alone, one yen. There's not that many people chopping off rhino horns. If you compare them to the idiots that we have here in America, just by capita. You know the, a number of people that are scarfing of Rhino Horn in Asia versus the number of people here, they're chewing on bath salts is probably way more bass.

Speaker 2:          00:30:02       All people here than Rhino Horn people. They're like, that's a totally racist thing to say, sir. For someone who is so concerned with the health and welfare of these Rhina Sy, this guy's an idiot. Yeah, well, he's a guy on a forum. It's easy to be an idiot on a forum. It's easily been in India on a podcast too. It's easy to be an idiot, you know? But I just, I don't understand why. Like there's, there seems to be like an easy cure for that. Like if you just got them some of that gas station, boner pills, they wouldn't want to have anything to do with a rhino horn. The Rhino Horn is worth thousands of fucking, yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:30:38       no. Unless there is a little bit of Rhino Horn in all these imagined calling us. They even made a Hologram on this one. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:30:45       no shit. Imagine if that's what it is. Yeah. We kind of find out, man. I bet we would be the pioneer. I'd be be the first person to actually do a scientific test on these pills, including the people that made them. I bet they never tested shit. They don't know what the fuck's in there. Probably, you know, when we had some of the earlier versions of Alpha brain, we would run these random tests on them and we'd find out that like there would be like b12 in air or something like that or creating or it wasn't creating, it was a beat 12 I would have to ask Aubrey, I'm talking about my ass, but the bottom line was the mixers that they used for our stuff, when, when they combine all of our stuff, they didn't clean it out, so they had whatever was in there before. Even though those just trace a trace amount, they don't give a fuck. They just don't shake that bag. Talk Fart, get on the radio, maybe spit in there. People are assholes.

Speaker 5:          00:31:42       Yeah. It's probably done in a tent also. You know, like it's it, it makes pride now the lab, it's probably a tent somewhere. Where do you think they make boner pills if you had a Pomona? Yeah, this is definitely, this is fan. Nice material. And I'll take this. Some dudes, they have a trailer right outside the freeway, like under an underpass. They're cooking it right in plain sight. Right. I just want to know the guys that sell these that come in to the gas stations. Like what those guys like the salesman that boner pills, no, number 11 and the sunglasses on all the time. You don't get to see their eyes sketchy la looking left and looking right. Apparently there's a big NPR piece on this. The other NBR people are in the getting hard ons. Nice. I'm just looking down the whole article right now, but it says contrary to the popular myth and the West Rhino Horn was never traditionally viewed as an aphrodisiac. I'm finding some stuff. They use it for all sorts of things like as a gift that some people think it's a hangover

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       cure is valued more than gold. Uh, something like $1,400 an ounce.

Speaker 2:          00:32:48       Paris and gold. Is that what you're talking about? Yeah, more than gold. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:32:54       Yeah. I'll show you. There is appetite for Rhino Horn drives poaching in Africa. This is from 2013. Um, they killed 668 rhinos in 2012. I go on and talk about what they're using to kill them and whatnot. And then it says how much it's worth.

Speaker 2:          00:33:11       Look at this smuggler. The guy give his name sits behind Rhino Horn. See? Oh, they were seized at the airport? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:33:20       Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:33:22       Yeah. There's a 60 pounds 60 pounds got caught being smuggled in Ho Chi Minh City. That was worth over like one point $5 million.

Speaker 2:          00:33:29       Holy Shit. Yeah. They use it for a lot of things. Apparently. That is a crazy number. I had no idea that six pounds worth 1 million bucks.

Speaker 6:          00:33:40       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:33:41       Surveys, 30 different ailments including hangovers like a fad. It became popular, but blah, blah ass thing to do. It's gift. It's a great gift to your boss or government official. A guy. It's a great gift for your boss or a government official. That's how boy, Fan and bull, how do you say that name? Fan. T. H. A. N. H. A. Retired Tom Dawn as we think we retired official who used to approve construction projects in the Vietnamese government. Got his stash of Rhino Horn. He began taking Rhino Horn to recover from drinking binges with contractors. Every time I drank alcohol, I'd go home and grind the horn and drink. It says, boy, a 65 year old grandfather of two an hour later, I'd throw up and feel sober again. Hmm hmm. That chick lake city has breakfast table. He unwraps piece of newspaper to reveal small grade block of Rhino Horn. He received as a gift. Whoa boy. Paul pours water into a specially made bowl with a rough bottom and grinds the block of Horn into a milky white liquid. The grinding creates an odor that smells like burned hair. It's because Rhino Horn contains Keratin, the main component, fingernails and hair. He says that the value of Rhino Horn grew as the value of Rhino Horn grew. It became a kind of currency. Oh, it's fucked. It's a part of their culture that's fucked. That's fucked it. They're like trading in, giving it to officials and bosses, and they'll could I have her yo. Very illegal. Right?

Speaker 4:          00:35:24       Why don't we just like liquor that way? Sometimes people use it.

Speaker 2:          00:35:26       How about Cuban cigars too? Yeah. Yeah. Well, Cuban cigars were the thing because Cuban cigars up until really recently, were illegal. We could smoke one right now and it was one. Which three of them. Exactly. Yeah. Who brought these in? A real Cubans there. Three of them. Cohibas hits man. Goddammit. Who brought him to us? I'll remember. No, it was or someone within the last month I feel like. Was it Chris Ryan? No, Chris Ryan's on the new Nikki glaser show. Uh, powerful. Pretty funny on that. That's a Chris Mcguire is the evp of that show. Such a good show. Powerful Chris Mcguire. We're here smoking a Cuban cigars. You're allowed to smoke them now. You don't what they say about Cuba, man, they say, you got to get to Cuba now. They'll like get there now because it's going to turn into fucking applebee's. It's going to be like, oh, giant. Six months from now it'll be Marriott bite the end off here. I've read something about how like we are already these dried out. They're gonna. They're going to be shitty. I heard that were like taking all their beverages, like the Americans are already like taking it. Like other waters broke apart. It broke apart. It's dry. We didn't put them in the human door. I thought they were in these, there's different kinds of these tubes and some of these tubes are sealed. These ones are just kind of screwed down. Let's say the Gar.

Speaker 6:          00:37:03       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:37:04       People hear that silence. That's a sound to me being a man smoking a cigar. Cuban by the way, probably fake. Just chewing on it. It's not, I don't chew on Dude, we can get you sick. I chewed tobacco when I was a kid cause I read Tom Sawyer and huckleberry Finn, which is now centered.

Speaker 6:          00:37:28       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:37:29       Shoot you like on the side of your mouth. Yeah. It's a real chew like you buy a brick of it will be and men here, men one turn that um, air conditioning thing on behind you and we'll uh, get some, some hot flow up in this bitch stuff. Um, but we were talking, oh yeah. So it was a a like a brick that looked like maybe like a pack of gum or something like that and you pull it apart and then you bite into the brick and pull off chunks of tobacco and chew on it. And I almost threw up once. Maybe I did throw up, but I was like, all right, this is stupid. But I got into it because of Tom Sawyer and huckleberry Finn. Yeah. I never got into smoking cigars because I wanted in a hail it so much. Yeah, but you get high as fuck off these things.

Speaker 2:          00:38:19       Tobacco has some sort of psychoactive properties to it for sure. And I think that they use it in a lot of IOWASCA rituals with a, they light tobacco smoke and they blow it in your face while you're tripping. And both Aubrey and Amber Lyon when they did it, we're talking about that. It's definitely got some, like I've smoked cigars before and got some really good ideas where I was like, well, my brain is flying. You'd probably really like cigarettes. I just can't wait until, except for the whole being healthy. Yeah, it probably would. Yeah. You know, Eddie Bravo, we'll smoke a cigarette every now and then. I remember that thing.

Speaker 4:          00:38:59       I found that thing a couple of weeks ago that didn't want to bring up because I wasn't sure if it was real, but it said that cigarettes are like proven. There was some study that was proven to give some sort of benefit for creativity. Yeah. There was the negative of the inhaling almost didn't even outweigh the benefit you got from creativity.

Speaker 2:          00:39:16       Well health wise, yeah, the risk. Yeah. They were saying that it's like a nootropic that it actually stimulates brain function. But if that's the case then you just talking about the nicotine. So, um, I've done before shows, I've sucked on those blue cigarettes. But first of all, because I want to be Stephen Dorff secretly and second of all, because they do give you like a little pep, like a cup of coffee type pep, you know? Yeah. Is that is, but that's not as strong as its cigarette

Speaker 5:          00:39:42       right now. That shit's bullshit compared to a cigarette like I've tried. That's why I've tried doing like the vape life and all that bullshit. But it's just a, it's not the same. There's just something to,

Speaker 2:          00:39:51       I should smoke a cigarette before I go onstage. Yeah. Let's see if it was just one time. See what it's like.

Speaker 5:          00:39:57       You should also have it with your morning coffee after you eat after sex. You should have it with a drink while you're driving.

Speaker 2:          00:40:03       The problem is people get addicted, you know, I don't want, I'm not going to do it. Like I'm not going to get addicted to cigarettes. I, I'll never let, yeah, the habit of doing it every time you had a show and yeah, that could be a problem. Even if you only smoked two cigarettes a weekend over the course of your life. That's got, that's a lot of cigarettes. Yeah. But you're old enough to do it now. Well, Eddie does. That's the only reason why I would think there'd be a way to do it is because Eddie, Eddie just, we'll smoke a cigarette every now and again. Like he might smoke once a month or every two months or something like that. And I'm like, wow, and what does [inaudible] look at every now and then? Every now and then we'll have one. Like, that's interesting. Diaz used to do that for a while too, but he doesn't do it anymore. He, I think he still does the blu cigarette though. We're talking about Joey not native to make our nick by the way, but um, dses to even after he quit, he would go outside and take a cigarette from you smoke one like right before a show. There's definitely some benefit in a nicotine. Definitely. I just would, I would wonder, maybe I should just smoke a cigar before I go on stage. Like what gives you more of a rush?

Speaker 5:          00:41:09       I'd say cigarettes probably better because you're inhaling it or you're supposed to inhale it and it's faster. You're not sticking up. The place here that's a problem with is tanking up the place. First of all, how dare I know. I know. I, I'm one of the guys that, that, that when they smell this, they get immediately angry. They're like, okay, who's the guy that's just fucking ruined everybody's Day? This is what we're going to do. We're going to go, well,

Speaker 2:          00:41:29       old timey men, not, not like men. The sixties and seventies were going to go old timey like thirties and twenties we're going to start smoking pipes. Ooh, no man, man. The only reason why I didn't want to watch that show is because I read headed grow, the buzzing me redheaded girl was just so hot. Water wash them. I like a girl's just not afraid to put some pounds on tobacco. You roll cigarettes with does that have a lot of nicotine? And I was just like, oh yeah, a spliff like if you made it half joint, half those, fuck you up, man. I'd never really do spliffs. I'm not a spliff guy, but when I was hanging out with Charlie Murphy, I did so Charlie Murphy would roll all of them. So you'd be taking in the weed with the nicotine together. I got higher than probably any other time before in my life.

Speaker 2:          00:42:13       Doing shows with Charlie. Charlie Murphy is one of the coolest fucking guys in the world. He really is. I love that guy. He's just such a good dude. Such a solid guy and he smokes the shit out of those blunts. I hate what routes do that a lot of is like the, the blunts. Usually it's, I don't know why it's, it's to me it's like a white guy smoking a menthol. Got, Oh, you're one of those blunt girls. Great. Well you dating girls that like the fuck part guys. Yeah, totally normal. Super Common. I that's more of an age. Did they say y'all a lot and get mad and throw their hands around like gang signs.

Speaker 2:          00:42:53       Like I could never be a cigar smoker in my house because then you could tell this with just fucking get on every smells awesome. You like the smell. I love it. Don't know what you're talking about, but I don't love it as much as pipes. And that's what I was thinking of. Was it a Bertrand Russell, I think who was a, a a a famous inveterate pipe smoker. Tobacco addict. Brilliant man. And back in the day, um, he wouldn't fly unless he could smoke on the plane. He wouldn't fly. He said. Yeah, there is. Yeah, that's him. He's got a story about a on tobacco. Once you find, find the youtube clip. Okay. Bertrand Russell on tobacco. Fascinating guy, because that guy lived in the dark ages of information as far as the modern world and the world of photography and the ability to document things. So to get a guy like this on a youtube video shotos I see is like big tobacco. What year was this?

Speaker 7:          00:43:49       You Bet. Go patient by all day long. The shipyard, I need you most gp hasn't that shortens your life? Will they do to see your night fish took to it? I took two jumps 70 years ago. Show that it doesn't seem to hit a vt Greeky fake Shopha pick. Do you know Ryan? What indication? He saved my day an airplane and did it getting [inaudible]. I should get me a sheet and shocking, but should I cannot smoke Geisha Day and sure enough, that was your neck. She didn't do bad accident and all the people in the back pain would drown people in into smoking pot and jumped into the Norwegian showed where we landed. Edward saved to the, I owe my life to smoking.

Speaker 3:          00:44:43       Did you have, did he drown? All the people playing crash, crazy sacrifice that story. He's a plane crash bro. That's crazy. So all the people that you see, there's a real ashtray that somewhere this seems like one of those stories that everyone was like, oh is that true? But there was no internet back then so we all just believed this guy. I think there probably wouldn't have been a plane accident, you know? And he probably made this shit up and just cause he's old, he's got a British accent or whatever,

Speaker 2:          00:45:13       like of liars got together and you know the had like liar conventions. Like the years that the internet came out, they'd be like, boys, we've got some problems. We got some problems on the horizon. We've got to figure out where to live better. This is how you got to cover your tracks. Like liars. They used to be super common to be completely full of Shit, particularly about your martial arts background. There was a lot of really crazy people when I was a kid that will like claim in martial arts master and they would walk around with like Chinese Kung Fu outfits on and shit and slippers. They're walk around with those Ninja shoes where they had the toe that was split. You ever seen those shoes? I've seen dudes walk around with Kung Fu outfits and did represent two completely different countries. The Kung Fu outfit is from Japan. The Ninjas slippers or from Japan? They, the Kung Fu output is from China rather than Ninja outfit is from Japan. These motherfuckers would mix and match the different styles of train killer.

Speaker 3:          00:46:09       That guy isn't a good example though. Like how back then you'd be like, so every single person died in the nonsmoking like every single one, every like there was a line where it said no smoking. All those people died. Well, the front of the plane, we'll all see you

Speaker 2:          00:46:22       think of when you're watching a guy like Bertrand Russell. How what? When did, when was that film did say if he was talking about how it saved his life, that had to be before they made that shitty ass old grainy movie, which was in black and white. So it was probably a long fucking time ago when planes were made out of fucking gum wrappers is when he died. That's when that interview was. Okay, so if it's in 59 then the plane was probably from the forties or fifties I mean, who knows when that happened, but yeah, that ain't

Speaker 3:          00:46:55       good. That's just mad denial and wanting an excuse for smoking. Yeah. Yeah. I say my live, I smokes a pipe. Dope pipe is definitely a different animal. Like my grandfather used to smoke and he used to have those big, back in the day they used to have, there's big lighters that would sit on your desk and it was just like, oh yeah, huge cloth wrap around the bottom of it. Yeah, I remember those.

Speaker 2:          00:47:17       This is the incident he was in. Oh, it was real. In bursts. Disaster it a crash for flying boat of what? A what? A flying boat house. Why didn't you mentioned that Birch flying bus survivors. We're all in the smoking compartment at the back of the cabin. It's true. Damn. Among the survivors. Will the philosopher, Bertrand Russell, wikipedia citation needed look a fee we could puffy da's. Awesome. Although it does say I'm five, nine and brian cows, my brother, I don't know why. Maybe he added that Brian? No, I think as in my, um, one of the things, oh, a shiny yet. Nope, not shiny. Happy Jihad. I'm going to be dead someday. The sketch that Brian Count and I did in my parents' basement where we're banging each other, we're working out, we're getting pumped. I think what, how that whole thing started is because you used to say he's your brother from another mother and some idiot was like, oh, they're brothers.

Speaker 2:          00:48:10       Well maybe it's just for fun. And people did any, looks like my brother, he totally looks like he'd be my brother. Like we just grew in different directions. He went north and south and I went east and West can be stretched his face out and he stretched his shoulders out. It's, it's very similar in a lot of ways, but he's um, might as well be my brother. But uh, yeah, wikipedia is wrong about a lot of shit. It says I have crones disease to at least it used to, which I don't word that even start for him. That's funny. I'm going to be in funny, so I'm being silly. I didn't want to change any of it. I think it's funny. I like what the Internet does for the most part. I think a little bit of disinformation makes a little p. People go, what?

Speaker 2:          00:48:51       Wait, are you serious? I like that. Like even when those stupid stories come out, like I killed them out in line with a belt. My own sister called me up, my own fucking sisters. Like, was that true? I go, what are you talking about? You can't kill a mountain line with a bell like you don't. You don't think I'd call you? If I did, I'd be like, strap yourself in sister. Cause your brother's a fucking killed him. Outline with a pal. Oh my God. What a fucking mount mine with a belt. I'm about to go do a news story. I'll call you back with it. It'd be strutting around in my underwear with scars all over my body. I'd have all the gauze like with the blood oozing through all the stitches, which I would be fucking covered with. Cause even if you survive a mountain lion attack, you need to fire then unscathed.

Speaker 2:          00:49:34       If you go to guy's code on Instagram, guys code on Instagram is an excellent, a little instagram page that has a lot of pictures of girls butts. Oh um, but the great butts, like you look at their assets and go, good Lord, why is it so appealing to look at? You know, even if someone knows he's never going to get near that girl, Ma much less be able to squeeze it from behind. Did you want to? And so it's worth looking at like it gives you that little ooh. So they're providing you with a little pleasure when they show you their acids and those pictures, those, those wonderful gals of the instagram. But I'm guys code had this picture of this guy who was like in the 18 hundreds killed a leopard with his bare hands. He got attacked by a leopard in Africa and it wasn't a giant one, but it was big enough to fuck you up man.

Speaker 2:          00:50:19       And he was all wrapped up and stitches, but the thing was dead next to him and his arms in a slang. I mean, he's fucked up. And when you got fucked up back then you got fucked up for keeps like they didn't fix it. There was no stem cells. They didn't have acl surgery. I mean I would literally be crippled. Both of my knees would be completely shot cause I had, there's the guy, what's his name? Carl Eight Glee, a k e. L. E. Y. And they have them down there as bad ass of the week and it's got a leopard. That shit. How much you think that weighs? I don't know, but it's like 60 pounds. Get enough to seem like it could be a little bit dangerous, but it also, it looks like you could kind of kill that. It just would suck. Like I have to pray to his poor cats snack Mahmood.

Speaker 2:          00:51:00       That thing would kill you. Yeah. Fuck yeah. Are you kidding me? Just think of, I think he'd probably kill me. I mean, I think that guy probably got real lucky. The cat was probably sick, which is why I was trying to attack and kill a person the first place. I mean that that does happen. They get sick, they get old, they, uh, sometimes their teeth get worn out and they can't kill something big anymore. So that's one of the problems with certain animals. When they, their predators, they start picking on people because they can't get animals anymore and people are so goddamn slow. So what'd he say? I felt no pain, but I certainly never thought for a moment that I would come out alive. I was rather calm as a matter of fact, except for a tremendous and wildly pleasant thrill. I felt knowing that I was battling for my life. What a fucking man. What a man. That's why he survived. What year was this?

Speaker 8:          00:51:56       What does it say it say? It doesn't say what a fucking

Speaker 2:          00:52:03       1864 64 and an eight. Oh, he fought an elephant to, he got pinned by an elephant. Okay. It might be a dick. Yeah, it's probably got slammed on the animal side. The fucking crocodile hunter overs day. Just threatening animals. Or you might, you know, if you're in Africa for a long enough time, you probably get jacked. So he was born in 1865. So how old do you think it wasn't? That picture would probably 30 right? Yeah. Scroll up, Jamie. Let me get a look at them

Speaker 8:          00:52:31       all the way up. There you go.

Speaker 2:          00:52:33       They're, it's like Kyle Kinane. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:52:38       that's a hard drinking. 35 that's the pens that lap that Lebron would fuck you up with. Fuck me up. If we had it in the studio, you know, terrified. We'd be, oh, it'd be terrified. But then once you grab it, you seem like you could just like fall on its head out of your mind. You're out of your mind. If you ever held on to a cat, the ones that get away, you have, you have cats deck. You ever wash your cat? Yeah. Yeah. I know. They tried to kick and fucking twist and they get mad at you. Pure muscle. You know I have two of the sweetest cats in the world until you try to give them a bath, those little fuckers want to go to war with you. I'm like, settle down. We're just getting wet. Right? Settle down. Wash yourself, bitch. You got a dirty ass. Especially when they're fluffy. Fluffy cats come out of the litter box where the eco hanging off their asshole. This is, they can't clean it. It's not supposed to exist in nature. He never supposed to have an asshole with all these feathers all around it. They can catch shit. What do you got there, Jamie for us?

Speaker 4:          00:53:36       See his, the Ackley or hour, he say his last name, Hall of African Mammals in the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan is upper west side.

Speaker 2:          00:53:45       So what was he, was he,

Speaker 4:          00:53:46       he was like some sort of conservation as hunter back in the time of like Roosevelt, I'm looking through this article. There's another guy, it seems like he was head to head with sort of like a Tesla Edison thing. There's guy named award. So they were going around searching and hunting for animals and finding new species of things and different in the Congo. Oh

Speaker 2:          00:54:04       Wow. Sorts of different places like that. I was watching this program on Buffalo, um, last night and uh, they were talking about how the buffalo were decimated and how, um, they were shipping these truckloads or a trains train carriage is filled with buffalo meat back to the east coast. Buffalo meat became high in demand and then buffalo hides were high in demand and they were showing in this, this thing that I was watching stacks of skins just stacks of skins and of skulls. And you just look at her like, what the F, how did you do this? How did you guys not think that this was a terrible idea? Look at that. We get those stacks of skulls. This is stacks that go all the way up to the top of that railroad cart. I mean, that's fucking bananas. Stacks of skins. Look at these skins.

Speaker 2:          00:54:57       I mean, they would just wiping out hundreds of thousands of them. Like how many did they wipe out a year? Because you got to assume like that stuff is probably recently come off the animal that says it's 40,000 buffalo hides right there. Oh my God, it's so crazy what they did. They're going to get this guy on the podcast. His name's Dan Flores and I found out about them from Steve Rinella and he has a very interesting hypothesis or, well, he's a scientist so, um, he has an a and a historian I believe as well. So he has maybe not a scientist either way. His take on what happened with the buffalo is essentially my butcher, this, but that when the first Europeans came to North America, they didn't find evidence of Buffalo. They talked about everything else. He talked about bear, they talked about deer, they talked about elk, they talked about all these different animals that we know exist here, but they didn't really talk about buffalo and the, he believes that with the sheer numbers of buffalo that that existed a hundred years later.

Speaker 2:          00:56:01       It seems highly improbable that they wouldn't talk about him. And his take is that what happened was when Europeans started showing up in America, they brought with them a lot of diseases and those diseases that they gave these people these like first of all, like there's a, there's a common myth apparently that they gave them syphilis in the form of scabs in blankets and they put scabs and blankets and game to the native Americans. As far as I know that's not true. Not only that, they didn't know about bacteria then. They didn't know what that you know that you would, that's how it was spread. They didn't know that you would give someone a scab and that the actual tissue from the scab would cause the disease. The knowledge of like how diseases were spread was not that sophisticated back then as far as what I read.

Speaker 2:          00:56:51       But what he's saying is that when the Europeans came here and they introduced these new diseases that they had, that the natives didn't have any immune systems for, it fucking devastated the population and he said that that is responsible for as many deaths as anything else to the native Americans that lived here. They just got fucking completely wiped out by European diseases. When that happened, the native Americans were responsible for keeping the buffalo populations and check and had been doing so pretty efficiently. Ever since that the horse was brought to North America because before the Europeans came here, native Americans didn't have horses. They were on horses. So the horses that, you know, we depict the wild west, that native Americans rider on the horse and how they've always been, no, no. They were always like, you know, like really nomadic people that live in Brazil or something like that in the rain forest or Ecuador or something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:57:46       They weren't on horses. So they got the horses from the North Americans, but they also got the diseases and while they hand the horses, they were on the way to, in his words, extra painting the buffalo from their domain, which means it local extinction. So they were already doing such an efficient job of killing the buffalo from horses because they'd run up on horses and just fucking Arrow the shit out of these buffalo. And they were ruthlessly effective cause they were on a horse. So they could get that horse right up at the buffalo because of Buffalo's full clip is about 40 miles an hour. But a horse can run about 50, 60, you know, and especially like a really strong wars. So these guys would just run up on these fucking herds of buffalo and blast them with arrows and kill them. And then they got guns and once they got guns, good googly Mowgli between horses and rifles.

Speaker 2:          00:58:34       I mean they were fucking these buffalo up. So what happened was they got almost wiped out and the buffalo came back strong. So when they saw these millions of buffalo out on these, these prairies, that was an over abundance, that was a rare cycle in time that corresponded with the death of the native Americans. And this is his, um, his paper that he wrote, Buffalo Ecology, I think something something Buffalo ecologies name is Dan Flores. See if we could find it. I think it's one of those university papers though, that you probably have to have a some sort of a membership and it's like one of those things that that kid got in trouble for releasing for free or that kid that wound up killing himself. Yeah, pdf or you can get others a pdf, what does it say? Bison and bison diplomacy. That's it. The southern plains from 1800 to 1850 really, really interesting stuff because you know, we're finding out more and more about the history of this country obviously because we still have Columbus Day.

Speaker 2:          00:59:36       I mean the fact that we still have a day named after guy who didn't even get here. You know he landed in the West indies, right? Isn't that where he landed in The Bahamas or some shit? Whether things do you think are on the way out and Columbus Day is definitely on the way. It should have been out a long time. He's a murderer. What else? Columbus as a mass murderer. If you go to collage to the, there was a missionary or someone that was there at the time of Columbus that detailed the horrors of what they did to the native American people that they found, which to try to get these people to give them gold. I mean the fucking whores. They would cut off body parts and send these people out. They would cut their arms off if they didn't bring back a certain amount of weight and gold, they would smash babies on the rocks.

Speaker 2:          01:00:17       They would take their children from them and smash them in the rocks. We were talking about boat boats filled with serial killers and we have, we have a holiday or kids get off school for a guy who ran a boat of serial killers that came across the ocean and just laid waste to everybody in front of them. I'm from a city that's named after him, Columbus. We even have his boat, like a recreation of his boat in Columbus, Ohio. Fucking crazy, man. Where's that? A lighter brother. He's got it said, you know, sparked that backups. Yeah, I'm high as fuck office. The wheat, the wheat helps. But um, uh, I dunno how we got on this bisons I was watching the buffalo blah, blah blah. We're talking about Dick's and it just went from Rhinos to oh yeah. That dude, um, that I posted yesterday was at cjw underscore photography.

Speaker 2:          01:01:09       That guy's a instagram page. He got ahold of me and he's making that wolf the wolf with the snow. He's going to put down a steel plate and send it to us. We're going to put it up here. Oh, so most metal prints of bad ass. Yeah. And that was like one of the most dope nature photographs ever. Have you seen it Brian? Pull it up. It's a, on my instagram page is the one that was specific. It's got this wolf and his face is covered in snow and he's looking at you, not the one that we showed John Dudley, my friend John who on here yesterday. Dude. He fought a pack of wolves off. It was trying to take his elk. Whoa. Yeah. Whoa. Barefoot. Like what do you do to two guides to barefoot only as asshole. That's it's how do we find them?

Speaker 2:          01:01:50       How has his feet, he was in Alberta, he shot an elk in these wolves, started circling and they ran in and they were trying to scare him off the elk and he shot one and then the other wolves showed up and he started howling and circling them that fucking picture. It's how dope is that picture. God Damn. I want to, he's going to come to the shows, one of the shows at the fillmore in San Francisco and a, I want to talk to them and find out how he took this and where was he got to be created. It's got to take lots of hours

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       of sitting and waiting and camping and being really cold.

Speaker 2:          01:02:23       Yeah. And to get this perfect shot. God, what a cool animal. Hmm.

Speaker 4:          01:02:28       I bet he's got some crazy stories of getting them, uh, and just being surrounded by wolves and whatnot because he's got a lot of cool pictures. Yeah. You gotta be, you gotta put yourself in a weird spot to be a bold motherfucker to get that photo. I mean, cause you can only be so far away, right? Yeah. Yeah. Your lenses can only take you. So

Speaker 2:          01:02:43       like how, how close would you be able to like that's so

Speaker 4:          01:02:46       it could be cried so it could be a little bit off, but it's such a really close picture. I bet he had a really good like 400 to 600 Lens, so, oh my God. Maybe 50 to 100 yards at the Oregon Zoo. A hundred yards. Yeah, I doubt it. But like 50 yards. Yeah. It's hard. I would imagine he'd be close to the ground. I'm just going to be crazy. It depends what camera you use to.

Speaker 2:          01:03:07       Um, if you go to see it, go to his, um, his instagram, there's a picture of that wolf with another wolf there. That's sweet. Yeah. He's got a pawnshop hopcat. Dope Shit. Yeah, that's a bobcat. I think we're links one of those. Sweet, well those mountain lions, it's got to look at that one. Licking his lips is a gene Simmons mountain mine make it up. What do you think about Gene Simmons and that whole controversy about what controversial am calling out Nwa saying they shouldn't be allowed in the rock and roll hall of fame because he said that rock and roll. Um, well kiss wasn't in the rock and roll hall of fame forever. So if I was him, I'd be like, fuck the rock and roll hall of fame. Fame is more of like a pop pop music, popular Music Hall of fame. There's a goal. That shit down the pharmacy. That wolf. Yeah. Um, the beastie boys are kind of rock though. If you listen to Paul's Boutique, that's the end. That's it. We'll scroll up then. Paul's Boutique Dude is, is a rock and roll album or an, I mean, I don't know what, how is that it? Oh No, maybe he's got another page. No, man. That's it.

Speaker 8:          01:04:09       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:04:10       Are you sure? Yeah. He's got 353 posts. Yeah. That's not at Jamie refreshing. It doesn't say no. It's just not refreshing. Just refresh it. Oh, there it goes. Oh, looking at raccoon. That's great. Erections are not, yeah, he's got great photos. Oh, amazing. Man. No, that's not at Jamie. There's, there's one scroll down to the exact same pose that wolf, but he's with another wolf. Why? Oh, there it goes. It's weird how it loads. Right.

Speaker 8:          01:04:34       And then it's not loading up though.

Speaker 2:          01:04:37       God Damn instagram. You know what it is? They went up to 62nd videos and their shit's getting hammered. Yeah. Hammer time. Um, there's another thing that I posted. There it is right there. There's another thing that I posted that is the exact same wolf, but with another wolf next to him. That might even be more bad ass. Jesus fucking Christ. Yeah. That's way better. Oh my God. It's like the wolf's telling him like, let's go kill that photography. Hey Dude, if you're, if you're listening, uh, scratch that. Make me one of these, make me the double wolf. Fuck. That's amazing. God. Damn, that's crazy. Holy Shit. What a picture that guy deserves like an award for that picture. Like that might be, I'm going to say it is. That's the coolest wildlife photograph I've ever seen. Wow. That's cool. Because yeah, it was undeniably cool that the photo looks so rare with, I mean, how do you get a wolf with all that snow all over his face like that.

Speaker 2:          01:05:32       What are the odds you're gonna capture that. And then another one, the same size right next to him. Maybe his wife. The wife won't pay the Wolfson. I left as a wife. Who is the wife? The wife's on there. Right? Cause it looks like he's, she's a bitch. She's bitching at him. Yeah. You don't mind the fact that he only killed five elk. You sell fucking lazy when you were younger. When you first met me, you did sound much to impress me because a guy's a, an animal to get out there. Chris, you're a fucking animal. Uh, just uh, I mean that's a Timberwolf. Yeah, man. I think that's a yellowstone. She's this, that those are in yellow. They have a lot of them in yellowstone. It's crazy. There's, um, there's a cool video that I posted or a photo I posted today from a national geographic.

Speaker 2:          01:06:13       The National Geographic instagram page is another one I'm fucking completely addicted to every other day. They have some just whoa photo where you look and you go, fuck God dammit, and today was a, these two bears there were duking it out in yellowstone. Look at the size of these fucking beasts. Look at a clause on him, the closet or on that one's back as their fight is two giant ass fucking grizzlies are going at it and one of them has wolverine style razor blades coming out of his front arm. Fuck man. Another John Dudley story. John who was here yesterday, he saw a bear kill a moose. He was there when a grizzly swatted a moose in the back and broke it's back. Wow. He said the bear was chasing the Mousse. It got the, they got into conflict. The bear got on top of him and swatted is back and broke it.

Speaker 2:          01:07:12       He said he broke his back with one swipe. Wow. He also talked about this cabin that they had in the woods where this bare broken in the cabin, pulled the wall apart, pulled the doorframe and the door off the wall with these nine inch spike nails all around it. Then there was a stove inside that smelled like food. He crushed the stove to the ground like you would stomp on a soda can just to ooze out whatever, like fat and grease was inside the stove. Fuck bears man. Fuck that. So crazy that we want more of those are like, we need to save those when you need them everywhere and the wolves to were like, oh, and they're, they're so awesome. Keeping that things a killing machine looking right through your eyes. It's cool that they exist though, you know? I mean it would be kind of cool of dinosaurs were still rare here too.

Speaker 2:          01:08:01       If there was like a real Jurassic island, you know, suck. Come on man. Long as you didn't have to go there. If it was like an island like New Zealand. Yeah, yeah. The Middle Past Hawaii, Guam. Yeah. Well New Zealand is huge. Probably not New Zealand. We would want to do that to those two. Yeah, they can get too big. Well, they don't have a New Zealand. It was like crazy wildlife situation because New Zealand is a fairly recent continent or island as far as I know, as far as like the volcano volcanic activity of the earth. And it wasn't a lot of land masses connecting it to other places. So they have some indigenous wildlife, like a bunch of weird animals and shit, but they also have a lot of stuff that is non native that was brought in. Like all these a hunting animals. These, these really rich dudes a long time ago, basically turn New Zealand into a hunting preserve and they just let these stags loose. These European dear, um, these red deer and stags tags is like, uh, a European form of elk and a, they let all these things loose all throughout New Zealand, but they don't have any mountain lions. They don't want any bobcat's. They don't have wolves, enough coyotes that, of anything that kills these things. So they have to send people out there to kill him. Like people just killing them constantly. And when some of the populations of some of the animals get too high, they have to fly over him and fucking gun him down from the sky.

Speaker 5:          01:09:22       They're having this problem right now with Cat Island, which is that island of cats, Alpha Japan and there are the, and they're in breeding like crazy. It's scary. All these cats like thousands and thousands of cats just live on this island must smell like shit by the way, I suppose. Smells like ammonia pissed,

Speaker 2:          01:09:37       you know. Did you see what's going on with Fukushima? Fukushima has a problem with radioactive wild boars. Nice. There's like hundreds of radioactive wild boars that have taken over that area because you know, the people aren't really there anymore and they're running rampant and they have a problem with them. They don't know what to do. They have radioactive wild pigs. Look at this fucking thing. Thousands of, oh, I said hundreds. Thousands of radioactive boars are overrunning farmland in Fukushima. But look at the photos of them. They have some photos of these fucking bores. Um, maybe different article. Yeah. Here's a good one. That might be stock footage though. Yeah. Wild boar stock seat on the fucking Internet wizard. Dude. I know it's probably all the photos are probably stock, but there was one video of this guy who had like a radioactive suit on like he was some sort of a scientist and these bores were chasing him.

Speaker 2:          01:10:32       Yeah, they all look stock, but whatever. Neha, who the fuck's going to go there and take those pictures? What is this other radioactive dudes? Those the a, the board themselves, they have a real problem. Those things start turning into like some comic book, Superhero type character powers. I mean they could things of radioactive, like what if they start morphing? What if it becomes super smart because we already know that boards are smart. Like pigs are supposed to be smarter than dogs, right? Oh there they are. This is the real ones. Shit running down the street. Lots of them slamming into the fucking fence trying to get out of this cage and they caught him in. Good luck. Good luck. Japan, they have, by the way, that that thing is still leaking thousands of gallons of radioactive shit into the water every day

Speaker 5:          01:11:25       isn't California. And we still have that gas leak up and send me valley or wherever that is. Did they?

Speaker 2:          01:11:29       Yeah, she'll that a long time ago, but that was bad. They said it was like every car in the United States, the emissions from every car in the United States in one day. Wow. I might have made that number up. FYI. FYI. Powerful desk squad cop. I liked this one man that I'm drinking out of available right now at death squad. Dot TV. Brian Red band creations.

Speaker 5:          01:11:51       Yeah. That's fun stuff. You, uh, you, you remember when we used to talk about that radioactive up there and, and uh, the thing I, it's funny because I know somebody or I met these triplets the other day that, that grew up there. What do you think the odds are that they're triplets because they grew up near that radioactive? What makes triplets? It's a real good question. I think horse the horse,

Speaker 2:          01:12:16       you just have to love Dick so much that you take in so much calm that there's this calm just rushes and no one egg wins. Yeah. Maybe a a dude who's just got a lot of calm. Maybe that's what makes me super aggressive.

Speaker 5:          01:12:30       [inaudible] people that have triplets my age. But I think nowadays it's probably more for like maybe they might be using fertility thing or two, what you take like an accident they had three and the only one is right.

Speaker 2:          01:12:39       That definitely happens. That happens with the older ladies. That's like John and kate plus eight. Remember that chicken like seven fucking babies inside of her and when they know eight inside of her and then two additionally they had to first and decided they wanted more and so they fill themselves up with babies. And uh, I remember that show. Boy that was an interesting show because that was a show that kind of showed how much pressure of the average person gets under when you're under the microscope. Like people that behave like totally normal, they think their behavior is totally normal, but then all of sudden they're under the microscope and the whole world sees that and then they get criticized and freaked on and then next thing you know, they can't handle it anymore and they break up. And then John, you know, was forced to get like regular jobs and catch them dating women and it was, you know, they would let hound the guy. I remember that. Yeah. It was really ugly. As real ugly.

Speaker 6:          01:13:32       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:13:32       And you know, they're poor fucking kids, man. Yeah. Almost. Yes. Just weird. So I guess they had six.

Speaker 6:          01:13:40       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:13:40       And then they, uh, they had two previous than they had six babies inside of her. And that's all those fertility drugs for sure. That's a weird man. It's weird, you know, because it's also weird because I'm pretty sure they were strictly religious, weren't thing. That's why I feel like that's when it happens. Yeah. Well not really because see like God says be fruitful and multiply, but he doesn't say anything about taking fertility drugs in order to make that happen. You know? And if it's God's plan, is it all God's plan when a scientist steps in? Is it God's plan? Because a scientist is here that God make the scientist, you know, where do you draw the line as far as like what God wants because if that's true, um, someone invented abortion. Was it God's plan to make abortion? It was God's plan for everything

Speaker 4:          01:14:23       and a multiple families for I'm from, cause if like Catholic family raised over 10 kids, I know at least three families that have 10 12 kids.

Speaker 2:          01:14:30       Again, horse horse. Was it fertility pills or of no, it's just like they almost had one every year. They just like to fuck constant job this time. Fuck you went to all boys. One's all girls. The kid. 10 of them. Yeah. Like 10 girls yet all blonde girls. Yeah. That's great. Wow. Lot of fucking going on 10 kids. You know when you die, how you like shoot yourself in the all the pis and everything comes out if you have any in you. Right. Well, I mean surely there's something that you have an anal sex with. A girl likes to do meth. Eddie Bravo. He said that's the way to go because they don't eat.

Speaker 4:          01:15:05       Ah,

Speaker 2:          01:15:06       Brian is a light bulb went off about the math. They don't eat and their apartments are squeaky clean. All they do is clean their apartments. I was just thinking of how realistic would it be, you know that Jesus on the cross, if it was realistic, if it was just shit and piss everywhere on the bottom of the cross and it cause even though they probably definitely be some, I would imagine if they fed them before they strung him up there. It's interesting too because they always show the crucifixion marks through the hands, but apparently that's not capable of supporting your body. They go through the wrist. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. Cause that's how you hang a deer. You go through the, the ligament behind the knee and you put like a stick through it and you get to hang up.

Speaker 4:          01:15:46       No suffocation. The way I would have hung his body. He would have suffocated in a couple of hours instead of days because the way the honey, yeah, the way your body would have hung the weight on your diaphragm or something like that. I was too much in Catholic religion class to have all this stuff explained it. Now I've learned extra stuff. No,

Speaker 2:          01:16:02       what uh, you know, there was a story that Danieli Bolelli uh, of history on fire. He's got an awesome podcast history on fire and the opening podcast. He has a pilot like episode zero zero and then he says episode one in episode one, he tells a story that he told on this podcast about this. Uh, I believe it was the Romans had hung up some insane, like a hundred miles of bodies, something crazy like that. Like what was the, the actual number I remember your till is saying that right now it was like the hymn sing. Yeah. It's a whole pathway or the whole road to wherever it was a hundred miles or whatever the fuck it was was just like every x amount of meters. They had a body that was crucified all, all along the road. The like that was how people used to roll back then. They used to scare the shit out of people. There was no like hiding the photos of the caskets. No, they, they hung people on sticks, stuffed them into the ground. Spartacus road, 6,000 spartacus, 6,000. I think it's the same thing. They crucified 6,000 people. Jesus Christ. People were Baroud back then. I mean, I guess they're brutal today. Um, there was an article that I tweeted earlier today are retweeted that. Um,

Speaker 9:          01:17:26       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:17:27       What's her name? Jen briny. How do you Sara last name? Um, she's the one who has that a political podcast. It's supposed to be good. What is her name?

Speaker 2:          01:17:38       But anyway, the, the articles about a guy, he, she retweeted something from, I think it was from the Guardian where a guy wrote what it feels like to be a on the drone kill list and that he made his way into Europe specifically because he was worried that they were going to kill him with a drone. And then he used to hide and sleep under trees so that his family, Eric, Jen Briny, how you spelled? B. R. I. N. E. Y. Um, that this guy would, would sleep under trees. It was in the independent sleep under trees to protect his family because no one wanted to be near him because he was on the fucking kill list for drones. Wow.

Speaker 5:          01:18:17       You see that journey with a chainsaw? That's scary. They made a drone that has a chain store attached to it and it's like doom. Did you see the [inaudible] video? I actually haven't seen it, but I saw the billboard on sunset. It's a movie or is it a video game?

Speaker 2:          01:18:31       There's a video, but the, the video, the video looks insane, but the, the doom billboard makes me want to play doom.

Speaker 5:          01:18:38       What is it? Supply chain supplying chain saw drone. They attach a chain saw to the bottom of a drone, turn it on and destroy it. I think this is the video where they'd destroy a snowmen with. But how scary is that?

Speaker 2:          01:18:52       It's a matter of time before we have to go to war with drones, right? Yeah. Oh my God, this is letters. There's flying over and Jack and snow man in the head cutting off, icicles

Speaker 5:          01:19:07       released. It's really popular. That's doing some cool things. It's like a Dji Phantom, something France. Him for it can follow you. You just like tap it, tap the screen and it'll follow you around. [inaudible] do you, do you have to register drones? Yeah. Yeah. Jeff. And now, now you do all of them? Yeah. Is it like this year I believe. Oh Wow. That's good. All of those programs, they have things built into them. They won't, they won't even let you fly into like non fly zones. Things cut, cutting

Speaker 2:          01:19:31       limbs off trees and then there you have another drone flying around taking video of it, which is hilarious. What a weird world we're living in today, man. I've thought about getting one just to try it. Do you told us you don't have one? It seems right up your alley. Yeah. Pull up the drone. I'm not the drone. The doom footage show Bryan. It doom. Go full screen please and don't, don't play a shit until it's ready. Multiplier one, right? Yeah. Dude. Wait. Do you see this? The multiplayer looks so bad ass. Yeah. It's like quake three on crack. I shouldn't say that on steroids from Hell. No. Those hacks hangs from Cra on crack from how watch this. Look at this. Look at the graphics. First of all,

Speaker 2:          01:20:19       how wild is this? Look, this looks, reminds me totally click right. Totally. Well it's in software. It's the same guys. All right. Oh this looks so fun. All right. Should we brian, should we get a land party in here? Fuck yeah, we should. We should such it should be, yeah. Wow. Okay. What is the company that, oh my God, what is the company that we should, uh, by our pcs from a couple of them. We get them Falcon or alien. We should get alien ware cause alienware used to sponsor us. Yeah. So just out of loyalty and respect, we should get alienware. So we'll should contact alienware and let them know we're going to set up a fucking land party up or you're going deep on this. I can tell. We'll have some fun. But I want to do though, Brian is you and me do this and we'll go on twitch.

Speaker 2:          01:21:04       Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. We just gotta be really pc sockets that's shitting happening. What are you talking about? Take off your shirt as a guy on twitch or you'll get banned. Everybody that's on twitch who keep their fucking shirt on. How about that? Except Demetrius Mighty Mouse Johnson and I think John Dodson's on twitch to [inaudible] James. Now all those guys could take their shirt off. Everybody else. Keep your fucking disgusting man. Boobs away from my Chris Screen. I've never seen this. I have two pounds. Well, you're lying to. Don't lie to me. So alienware if you're listening and hook us up or Falcon northwest, do you want to bring us over? Yeah, I like alienware man. I, I had that old laptop that they gave us back in the day and I will turn it on the other day. I'm pretty sure they both sponsored fighters, I'm pretty sure. Did they?

Speaker 2:          01:21:56       Sure. Yeah. Yeah. So are you, I'm touting down with all but loyalty to alienware for two reasons. One, because we used to use them. I used to run the podcast, uh, my, my version of it and you know, when I used to research stuff that was all from the alienware back then. That was cool. I liked it was big ass fucking screen. Who did I give that to? Okay. Uh, you remember I remembered you telling me you gave it to somebody. Somebody who plays games. Don't care trainer, didn't you? You have to. Justin was the, Justin probably was justin. I think you sold it. They make bad ass laptop. So I like, I like how the ones that we had, you could change all the colors of the keywords. So like half of it's purple, half of it's blue. Yeah Dude, I'm infatuated with the Lenovo thinkpads.

Speaker 2:          01:22:35       I read this review of a Lenovo thinkpad. It has 15 hours of battery life that's supposed to have them the most tactile feeling keyboard. Like this guy was, di did a review of it and he said that the keyboard itself I saved at home. Second, he said that the keyboard itself was so good that it actually upped his words per minute faster than his, uh, his average wedge, which I was like, what? How is that even possible? Yeah, but it seems like bullshit. Who does that? What we say that Lenovo thinkpad t 50 review and it's on Laptop magazine.

Speaker 2:          01:23:13       I would do it except for the having to deal with windows. I'm just, I'm top mag.com. Yeah, but I mean have you tried the newest windows? Like what is like windows, what do we all know when those 10 for real. That's hilarious. Um, but it's supposed to keyboards supposed to be amazing and the battery life's supposed to be crazy. I'm just bored. I just want to try something else. I know that apple and also you can take the battery out. You'd have a separate battery. You remember when you could do that? Yeah, something like that. I like the fact that you keep a fucking full battery with you on that came up that there, that's their kind of pitch. I think it's lg or slide in slide out battery. And it comes with the next one. Well, my galaxy until the recent one, my Samsung Galaxy had that and it was waterproof and you can take the battery out.

Speaker 2:          01:23:56       It was still waterproof, goddammit keys to be able to carry an extra battery it in your laptop bag and your, your laptop was running out of battery. Close it, pop that bitch out, pop the new end. You're back in action. Fully loaded. But now you have those like portable charger, battery chargers and things like that. So it's kind of unnecessary. What's really interesting is as good, oh yeah, I have one that can charge up your a iphone, I think two or three times. Your iphone. Well, what about your laptop? Laptop, that mean they have big battery pack. So you've had one before. But I had, when I went hunting, I brought one with me that I didn't even want abusing cause it was so tired at the end I was like, I am going to document this like William Shakespeare. I'm going to be like hemingway out there in the field.

Speaker 2:          01:24:37       Fuck that. The end of the day, you've walked 14 miles up mountains. You're exhausted. You don't want to do shit. You take a shit in the woods, dig a hole, go back to your tent, pass out. But um, I carried it around. It was probably like at least 10 pounds. It was huge, but it worked. Worked when you need it. IPAD, I'm sure. No, fuck I pads. Yeah, I like a button, man. I'm a, I'm a tactile person. I like to feel buttons. Like even I, it took me a long time to get used to the iphone, but the iphone is benefits of touching the screen. You know, having the full screen real estate for videos and photographs and email. It's so worth it. It's so worth it because I know that blackberry came out with a new one with a giant ass screen and then the, the thing slides out the bottom and then you have a keyboard, not pioneer.

Speaker 2:          01:25:25       No enough is enough. You could just get the ipad pro with a keyboard, like a real keyboard. My snap. You can't save files. I can, no, you can't. You can't like put like Microsoft word files in a folder on your desktop. Yeah, they have Microsoft word now on your desktop, but you can put it in the cloud equivalent thing. You can nowadays it close to you. What do you mean close to that? Oh, does it go in the cloud or is it uh, uh, it probably is saved on your ipad but I bet you could use like the docs app for Google or something like that. Yeah. Pages for that's on that and you can save it on something. So offline use, it's cached and the new force speaker system on the ipad pro is bad ass. There's four different speakers and it detects if you're holding it.

Speaker 2:          01:26:09       So like it, if you're holding it on the left side it will make a, the bottom left louder, you know to, you know, it knows where your hands are. Tom Or whatever. Use that though is in a hotel room. In a hotel room. I have one of those little bluetooth speakers. Those tubes. It is so good. Bad. It sounds so good. I bring that fucker with me to green rooms now because I sometimes you're in a green room and you'll listen to some CNC music factory and shit. Dat, Dat, Dat, Dat, dat, Dat, dat. Come on. I don't, this is not what I want to hear. When I get ready for a show, I want to hear my shit. It's like put on some cool music. It's great man. It's great having one was little things because it's so small. Why did they have, has anyone ever asked you or have you ever thought of like, uh, having your own playlist before you go on?

Speaker 2:          01:26:50       I guess for the theater when people, I don't want to infringe on the creative rights of the guy. Who's the sound guy in that situation you just said, right now you've got someone picking a C and c music factory to warm up your crowd like that. I'm totally making that part up but it can happen. But no, there've been some bad fucking music. There've been some bad music way. Where the fuck did you get CNC music factors and that's a randomly allocating something really shitty from a long time ago. That's hilarious. I haven't thought about that. I want to go, I mean you could have like a nice little like just even like if you just put it in your warmup or your workout playlist and just have those like rock songs with a couple of a hip hop songs. Like that'd be good to play for 30 minutes while someone's warming up instead of a anything random love shack or be 50 Tuesdays.

Speaker 2:          01:27:37       Yeah, they do that a lot but sometimes they get good songs. Like there was a place where at the other day in um, Santa Barbara, we did the Arlington Theater, which was fucking awesome. Hinchcliffe Diaz and I did this theater in Santa Barbara is great fuck and I loves it above. That's my spot, dude. That is the spot and I want to talk about it anymore. I don't want to talk anymore. I don't want anybody to know about it. So it's such a nice city and how much land you could get out there. Also, if you bring up just winning a little gross from cattle. Whoo. Um, but anyway, my point being they had a, they were playing some music. I saved it on my shoulders, lamb, and it was, uh, it was some sort of, um, Spanish music, like some Spanish rock that I'd never heard of before and they're singing it in Spanish. I was like, God damn, this is awesome. Like whatever it is. I love it. I don't remember what it was. One direction. No, no. Spark up my cute it. Would you say Jamie was given another shitty band? It's called middle. It says dj snake featuring bipolar sunshine.

Speaker 2:          01:28:51       What's that even mean? I don't know man. I Dunno, but uh, see if you could find that. I got it. Listen to this. We'll fuck us up. That's fine. It'll fuck us up on youtube. 50 million views on youtube. Oh, bipolar sunshine, a snippet of it. I can get it for the audio. Okay. For us, for the audio listening. Youtube people won't hear this part. Okay. Youtube people should I sing along? So it's like there's this, is this definitely the one that I, this is not sound like it. How do you know what you've seen now that ain't that Jamie, oh, this is it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Try this. Uh, it is a l e, g r e two zero zero three. Yeah. Alegria and then it's like a little space. Two zero zero three truby trio. This is what it was. Um, that would, that one was that I just, um, said was one that, um, was it showed up at the front of Shizam and I mistakenly thought it was the last one that I shazammed is that a verb?

Speaker 2:          01:30:02       Shizam she's doing this now. I fucking love Shizam that's such a great application. You know, you don't even have to use it anymore. You could just use Siri. She doesn't know I'm done. I'm like that bitch. Yeah. What? Yeah, this is it. This definitely it. Does this have any hits online? So the youtube people hear this or no, you don't even hear anything? Youtube people for you, like what is happening over there? You're going to have to go to it. It sounds like jumps not good, dude. It gets going, but it's what I like about Spanish. Music is a, I don't know what the fuck they're saying. So it's cool. Like I get the emotions and I get the Vibe, but it's rusted, rusted root. That sounds like your Dick. Now after you bang a chick was on the period.

Speaker 2:          01:30:52       Oh God, no. I have so big an 18 inch root. Keep this going. If the youtube people don't hear it, do you think it will get us pulled off itunes? That won't happen, right? Yeah. Um, but Joey Diaz, his cousin has a ban from Cuba. It's awesome. That is. They're fucking amazing. And they're on my playlist here. Oh really? Yeah. With Alfonso X. X. Alfonso X. It's x a. L. P. H. O. N. S. O. There are fucking bat. What is that? That's the thing. That was the route that was poured out of a dude's ass. Come on son. Yeah, he used it for sexual play. Come on from the anal cavity. Oh my God. Well, it takes about 35 years of ass fucking to take so much dick in your acid wides it up to take that route. We're looking at a route that is about the size of Jamie's whole leg.

Speaker 2:          01:31:49       Right. If you had to guess. Yeah your arm. No, go back to that. Let me say that photo that looks like more like a leg dude. It's like a baby, you know that's like, that's like tate Fletcher's forearm. It's like a big giant man's forearm. That's like my Dick on the opponent pill. Right there isn't the same color too ready to explode like an Oscar Meyer Wiener. Did I tell you I use Suntan lotion on my dick and I actually made my Dick Black Brown and mean tanner self. Tanner Tanner. Cause I did have any lotion and I was like, who's tanneries was like an ex girlfriends. I'm like well this is lotion. And so you turned your Dick to block, turned it to like a orange, just brownish. And it was so weird cause it, it actually changed the color of my Dick. Wow. So between that and the boner pills, what kind of birth defects you think your children would have adopting an Asian girl.

Speaker 2:          01:32:41       And I'm like, you're going to go with y'all and style. Yeah, I mean, look, don't do it. Raise her to be awesome girlfriend or was Russian and took this shot. I was listening to this woody Allen thing the other day. It's woody Allen on comedy. It's really interesting because it's woody allen. Uh, there was, uh, two things that I bought. One of them is woody Allen doing stand up in like the 1960s. It's good. He's good. He was a very good stand up man. He was a good comic. Why shaking your head? I just hit, he, he, he's a whiner to me. It wasn't that windy back then. It wasn't that one you back then. It was, um, it was a different style. I mean it was, it was different. He was a different guy. He was a young guy and he was known more of as a comic.

Speaker 2:          01:33:19       And then there's also, uh, an interview where it's just woody allen talking about the process of creating comedy and what he did. And that's kind of after he hits stuff. Yeah, that's it right there. Those are the two of them. Woody Allen on comedy and then Woody Allen standup comic. Those are the two that I was listening to back to back. It just, you know, I'm not, certainly not sympathetic to like what he's done. I mean, he's such a fucking Weirdo and what he's done, just this, the fact that that girl was his daughter and I guess it's so creepy to me write to everybody, but looking past that and just trying to, uh, examine him as a human being. What a, a, a complex and weird human being he is. He's, he's pretty fascinating. And I don't think he's victimizing anybody else, at least as far as I know.

Speaker 2:          01:34:05       So I don't, I don't have any judgment. I'll just, whatever. He's not in jail, so no one's, no one's going after him. So whatever. I'm, so, I'm, I'm just watching his life. I'm just looking at his life and he's such a fascinating character, man. You know, he is a jazz musician and for awhile he did, he did a documentary before everything got real ugly right where he was going around. Was it before everything got real ugly or was it in the middle of it all? But he went around playing jazz concerts. Like that was always like sort of like a, a dream that he had. So he went around and doing a bunch of jazz concerts and um, he writes all of his scripts. Yeah, there it is. Wild Man Blues. 1997 wonder who named it. Maybe it was ironic, ironic calling him the wild wild man blues or is building a wild man. I wonder when was, if some of it's, that's 97. When did, um, all this controversy take place? I think before this, right? Well, I don't think so because that's 20 years ago. So 20 years ago that that girl was like 10. You know what I'm saying? It's just weird how we still celebrate woody Allen, but yet fucking Cosby, forget about it.

Speaker 2:          01:35:20       We celebrate woody Allen macaws. We forget about it. Well, woody Allen seems to have fallen in love with a girl that he adopted, which is this crazy. It was in 1992 when it started as just a quote filling 23 she responded to someone paternal. Woody Allen reveals secret to his 23 year relationship with Mia Farrow's adopted daughter, which at first he thought it was just a fling. What do y'all and went to [inaudible] rare details about his relationship with Sunni. They got together while he was dating her adopted mother Mia Farrow. Now married Sunni 44 and Alan 79 had been together for 23 years. Whoa. I see what she looks like. So she was 21 when they started getting it on. Alan said, well, he's 80 there, dude. I mean, she is. She's half his age and she's 44 she likes that Daddy Dick. I mean, what the fuck man? Yeah, she's 44 and he's 79 that is crazy. She's almost half his age.

Speaker 2:          01:36:16       Wow. They'd been together for 23 years. Oh, I'm sorry. Go back. Go down. No, go down. No, no where it was. Yeah. Thanks. Um, Alan says it worked because he was paternal, which helped her flourish. And these are in quotes, paternal and flourish or in quotes. He also reveals that he thought it would be just a flame when they started lang. That mean he just flame raped her or something. Oh, he just got away with fucking his daughter is when it was weird man. So where he looks so odd and that photo too. And that's 92. How, wait, how old was she when they adopted her? Like 17 cause then I can get into that. Was this article from 90 to Jamie?

Speaker 9:          01:37:01       Nope.

Speaker 2:          01:37:02       Oh, published 2015 oh, why just say 92 now? The fling started in 1992 oh, okay. That makes sense. Cause how the fuck was she? Yeah. Okay. Then I'm retarded because in 1992 that makes sense. Wow. That's so weird though, Dude. So he talks about it now and they've been married forever. See that's what's fucked up about it. What's fucked up about it is it worked. They've been together for 23 years. They have children. Look at that photo of him, let's scroll down and look at their photo. They're smiling there, arm in arm, they leave, they're happy together. It's fucked up, but it works. So I get a certain point in time. I mean, it's not, they're not genetically related, which is always the big concern. Right. The big concern was that your genes would be, if you had sex with someone who's your actual daughter, your genes be all fucked up and you'd uh, oh, she's kissing him on the cheek. She seems to love them. Shovel head. But you know what I'm saying? I mean, it's like, uh, we have these ideas of what's, uh, what's okay and not okay and it's certainly seems fucked up. But if she was 21 when it happened, she was a grown woman and she decided, you know what, I want to fuck my dad, my sort of dad, the guy who lives across the lives across the city, they live in like

Speaker 5:          01:38:17       opposite sides of the parking or so in this picture, I mean, yeah, I could see what he was doing. He was probably fucking her though at this age. That's what the problem is as it's parental, you know, he should not be, he might have like raised her to want that Dick. Ooh. I mean if, if you can adopt a girl at 17 maybe find like, I mean that's not bad. Right. Cause it's like if you were like a parent to a kid for like six months.

Speaker 2:          01:38:42       Yeah, I'm well I'm sure that's been done. Wasn't it like a Ted nugent? I just, it wasn't, it jokingly hinted out for a long time before they actually came out and said like, oh, I don't know actually, I don't know. But Ted nugent did that. Ted nugent adopted a girl. So like Google that there was like some crazy controversy

Speaker 5:          01:39:02       cause I mean that might not be a bad deal checking out some of these like orphanage websites and just finding the 17 year old ones.

Speaker 2:          01:39:08       Yeah. It's fun to it. See if, uh, but good. Just Google that, you know, he, well he wrote songs about like having sex with young young ladies that were very young under age. Ted nugent pick, Ooh, yeah. Legal Guardian. He became her legal guardian. That's what it is. He didn't adopt her. She was 17 that's exactly head of his time. But back then. Okay. What year was this when this happened? All right, get rid of these photos. Gross me out. Um, what year was that? [inaudible] 78 78 how much different with things back then do you take that into consideration? You have to almost all the time. It's hard to consider the con. That's like the context of what's going on. Right. What was the context in the culture at the time? Because we were talking about that with the socrates. Socrates was, you know, they were all pederasts, they all liked to bang young boys. It was real common back then. And, but yet no one, no one has a little asterisk next to everything soccer. He said you don't say, but remember he used to bang little boys, you know, but if that was today you would, so as far as like woody Allen did, it's creepy, but is it bad?

Speaker 5:          01:40:23       It just depends when it started and if it started when she was 12 or something like that, then he could have like totally fucking, yeah. Brainwashed her to the point where now she just thinks she has to be with him

Speaker 2:          01:40:33       and there was a mia frowns. Other daughter was saying that he did something to her too. But Woody Allen was saying that. What do be US magazine? I like, I'm going to stop right here and talking about it all day. Yeah. Jamie's Colby Bryant's new sneakers road last day. Shut your mouth. How do you even know that 20,000 bucks to go to that game if you want to go. What? He would pay that much money for a baseball game. It's basketball. Yeah. Who would man crazy

Speaker 4:          01:41:03       kids from? They're American but they flew, they like left Italy to follow them around all year and it's been a bunch of money. They haven't said how much in debt there, but they've gone to like 30 plus games all over the country.

Speaker 2:          01:41:14       Um, that's not crazy

Speaker 4:          01:41:15       fans. Yes. A lot of, a lot of them are Asian though. He did a really good job marketing himself in Asia. Did he, how did he do that? Nike. They took him over there every year in the off season. He would go play and do like a exhibitions and whatnot and they were doing it to get the Asian market into the MBA and it worked. The devil, they make a lot of money off the Asian market way more than I would sit and make the United States. Obviously there's more people there, but they love basketball there. Stephon Marbury left the United States, went and made a lot of money there. He's going to retire as like one of the most famous hall of famers and Chinese basket.

Speaker 2:          01:41:47       Well, what happened to Lynn Sanity? Obviously I'm on the outside. I don't hear about that dude anymore. He's in Charlotte right now. That's why I'm, but what's happening? Is he doing well? He's okay. He's just an average, really good point guard. What the fuck happened during that one time where he's just New York and what was he doing? He's just kept hitting three pointers or something. I'm really good street. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:42:04       Give like 10 games where he played extremely well and they needed some hyped of weight and he was playing into the hike and it worked out

Speaker 2:          01:42:11       and now it's over. It's not that it's over, it's just there's other things to talk about. Yeah. But how come like me on the outside, I find out about athletes when they're in trouble or they do something crazy. They have to do something like really good. Like that's the only time I, and I remember thinking, well this guy, I remember thinking, well look in there finally. You know the Asian people have some super fucking bad ass basketball player other than the giant guy. This is what he was doing. He was like doing the crazy hairstyles like dragon ball z out his hair this year. Crazy spiky hair. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:42:40       But like, like I said, he's playing in Charlotte, which is a smaller market. So there's lot of people talking about it. When he was playing in La, which you did a couple of years ago after the whole thing happened, which was a part of getting the Asian market into play in the NBA and like the Lakers and there's a lot of Asian people in la that they could get money off of. So he was in New York, he went to La, played in Houston for a little while, but now he's stuck in Charlotte, which is why you don't hear about them.

Speaker 2:          01:43:00       Okay. Well also he hasn't been set in the world on fire. Right. And they're not, they're not one of the top teams, but they play against the top teams. Right? Yeah. So if he was like super awesome, you would hear about it. Right. And you still do it. If you tuned into sports center and see the top 10 or something like that, you would hear about his name here and there. Right. He's just kind of like four k four k. What does that mean? He's okay. And that was that fun. And that was a hinchcliffe I okay. Wow. Why foe soup? That's Vietnamese. He's not Vietnamese. He was racist. And not only that, I don't think it's pho. I think it's really, you say Fafa. Yeah. Which hey listen, spell it different. And why do you think you can get away with using our words different? You know you were over here using all language. Huh? What'd you get your own fucking way to say an r? So wait, if it's, it's

Speaker 5:          01:43:52       far. Yeah. So then why do so many of the pho restaurants always use it as it's like pho. Like cause I know that we're stupid and we don't bother researching what the actual word. It's like how many people called the hoists? Gracie Royce Gracie? Because they were unaware that you have to pronounce the r like an h when he's speaking Portuguese. Yeah. I like how joey has always hundred percent says Gyros and I hasta no gyro. I've been having these fucking gyros lately. Dog.

Speaker 2:          01:44:22       Yeah. Joey Diaz do whatever he wants. I liked when he screws up people the names, it's half the fun half the fun. Where the fuck's dom? Irrera plus beer. I'm was going to text me.

Speaker 4:          01:44:35       I was trying to ask you yesterday, Joe, about this facebook camera. What you thought about it. Whoa. It's 17 cameras put together in one to make, it's called the facebook camera. They announced it. They don't, they're not selling it or anything like that. It's going to cost 30,000 bucks to put it all together, but supposedly it's going to make seamless three 60 video. Holy Shit. Uh, so people can watch it. The guy that,

Speaker 2:          01:44:56       how long before that flies around?

Speaker 4:          01:44:59       Yeah. So if you could put it on a drone, that'd be pretty, yeah

Speaker 2:          01:45:01       dude, that looks like a Ufo. I mean this thing that you showing me right now looks exactly like a classic Ufo, doesn't it? Like if they could figure out how to, a way to make that like put some sort of a inside fan makes that thing hover and move around.

Speaker 6:          01:45:20       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:45:20       They'll, they'll looks like a Ufo. They, they sell one that's like that one that they sell. Kind of like at best buy or Amazon though. Like it's the same idea where it just records it, like write it records like a three 60 thing. But you can't really do anything with the video other than the vr.

Speaker 4:          01:45:35       Yeah. There's a lot of trouble right now going into a lot. When we brought this up the other day, a lot of people were asking us, hey, you guys should do it. It'd be totally awesome, which it would be cool for us, but there's a lot of hurdles to get to.

Speaker 2:          01:45:44       Well, you had a real good point too. We said, remember when people are going, how come everything, is it on three D tv? What about three d TV while you're doing your show on three d tv now try to find a three D tv. Nobody has one.

Speaker 4:          01:45:53       The Three d broadcasting was still probably only did twice.

Speaker 2:          01:45:56       It's not ready. Yeah, none of that stuff's ready. But I think it's going to be like oculus rift. Like it wasn't ready until it's ready. You know, like for the longest time when we were kids, virtual reality was a thing like there was even a movie. Where was it? Lawnmower man. Oh Man. Yeah. I mean it was based on like we thought, oh my God, any day now we're going to be in virtual reality. And it never took place because the computing power and the graphics and everything just wasn't ready. But now that it is ready, like that invidia demonstration that they did with all the crazy shit that you can do with a, um, with virtual reality and those a oculus rift goggles. What is that dude from of iron man that his lawnmower man really? Was it that cheesy looking? Yeah. Yeah. No, it used the same animators from beyond the mind's eye.

Speaker 2:          01:46:43       If you ever watched that, that guy that was in lawnmower man, the guy on the right, that dude was in a bunch of movies. He was one of those movie stars and I don't remember his name. Yeah, I don't know who he is, but that guy was in some big ass movies. He was always like the creepy guy. He's one of those dudes like the dude, where's my car guy? I like after he's not doing that, those movies anymore, it becomes like, hey, or American pie. The American Pie. Yeah. What's l? Jeff Leahy. Well, he's actually pretty famous. I remember his name. It's just me. I forgot his name. That guy has been in everything though. Talking about stiffler. Yeah. Stiffer. Yeah. What happened and stuff. Like I just saw the video on him yesterday and why he hasn't been marketed. He just had a couple quote unquote bad roles, if you will over the movies failed where he was like a leading man, but he's been in all the ice age movies. He's still doing pretty well for himself, I'm sure. Oh, nice feel good moment, Jamie. Beautiful. All right. Dom Arrera is going to be here next. We're going to pause this bitch for a moment and then bring in the Great Dom Arrera uh, these death squad.tv mugs that Brian brought in. How long are they for sale for
