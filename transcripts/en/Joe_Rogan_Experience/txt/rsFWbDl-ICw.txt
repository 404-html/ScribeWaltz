Speaker 1:          00:00:00       That story seems to show up. So I'm flying them out after we called. Okay. I'm going to do a podcast and him which subtitles in Spanish and I'm bringing them up here on Friday. Why? Yeah, my company to do it for me in Spanish with subtitles. And then I'm going to bring him up here on Friday and we're going to have a three way about Cuba. Well it was like to rest on the whole thing if you don't mind. Well you mind so I'll do mine about subtitles. Justin at Barnard. Yeah. So no, we will not clash with you dude. The three of us together would be the greatest podcast cause I could interpret it and you would be, would be, uh, it would be a real mma. You could really talk to them about under hooks and to Russia. That's a fantastic, the Cuban where they shipped them cause they ship you off when you were a young kid. They did. A lot of people don't know. Yeah, they look at you on that ain't go, uh, I looked at them. You don't have a choice. They look at you and they go do, I said, look, try that on. That's it. Now. Then they'd take her to a certain age and that or the 80 to send you to Nicaragua or Russia.

Speaker 1:          00:01:08       You train and that's why a lot of Cubans that you docus because they'd go to rush and learn judo. Wow. So he's going to tell you how they shipped him off and they don't just tell your mom like would take him tomorrow.

Speaker 2:          00:01:22       That's it. It's always been interesting to me because the Cubans and the Russians in particular were always thought of as being very technical. Really. The Russians, Russians are super technical. That was what a lot of people attributed George Saint Pierre Success in wrestling. You know, George didn't wrestle in college or in high school, uh, but he trained with a bunch of Russian nationals and Montreal and apparently phenomenal wrestlers and they have this incredible wrestling program. Like when you see, when you see Norma met off the way he mauls people inside the octagon, like what in the fuck? Like that is like a, a perfect example of that. Like style of super hard, super technical wrestling. They're so good at it. There's so many. Did you see, you know what you see Loma Chanko used to be a wrestler is a video of La Loma Chanko. It looks like he's doing sambo.

Speaker 2:          00:02:10       It looks like he's got a like a gian and it's him and some other cat and he's like 11 years old or something like that. So his father put him in everything. His father made him. Do you know Loma Chanko is? Yes. Yes. One of the best boxers ever. Like literally one of the most technically beautiful to watch boxers it's ever lived. But this guy, he used to wrestle too. Like is this is a, I don't think this is, it is. It does him. Okay. Is this him wrestling with somebody? Yeah, this is one now. Or he can still do this shit. This is like pretty recent. Like he showed some of his wrestling moves, but the other one was him when he was a little boy. Like he's really tactical man. He knows how to wrestle. This is legit. Like when you see the way he's moving his body, he's not faking that.

Speaker 2:          00:02:54       He's done that a bunch of times and yeah, this is, this is one when he's a little kid, man, it's crazy. It says Greco Roman wrestling, but they're wearing a geek, so I'm not exactly sure what it is, but he gets his kid and a gets behind them and send them for a ride. So he was, he's always been an amazing athlete, like an area. I think there's, there's something to that. There's something to, his father had an idea to crazy ideas. His father took him out of boxing and put them in a dance for like several years. Uh, Ukrainian traditional dance style. Apparently they were talking about it on one of those hbo shows for like four years, I think it was the hbo show, but for four years, I think he just danced. You imagined that his father's like, you want to learn how to box, you got to dance and now nobody's got footwork.

Speaker 2:          00:03:44       If you've seen him, Joey, you've seen like his highlight reel. It's insane. It's insane. It's insane. Jamie, pull up. A woman will highlight reel because my daughter goes to ballet and 80% of the clashes Russia, so I was thinking about it. Yes, that was watching the movements, the last parade movement. I'm like, Jesus Christ. If people did ballet and I was thinking the GSP, like you know me, I'm like pre probably fucking does ballet give them any wood bats would be, it's great footwork. This guy is the wizard or footwork. It's crazy because he was like right in front of you, but he's one step ahead of you at every turn. Like he knows what you're going to do. Right. While you're doing it, he's moving in a way that you can't move. He's in front of you and then he's not. It's crazy. Like he's the one of the most technical boxers I've ever seen and it just an amazing stylistic achievement like what he can do with his body.

Speaker 2:          00:04:43       His style is totally unique. I mean every, but a lot of guys have done it. A lot of guys that moved in and out. A lot of guys have done it, but he's doing it and it's such a high level, such a high level that it makes people confused. Guys quit in their corner that like what in the fuck? And I really think a lot of it probably had to do with his father's cross training and it particularly with the dance, I mean think about how effortlessly he goes, like steps around guys. I mean he's got some incredible control of his feet, but it makes sense that like you would learn how to move your feet in a specific way that weren't the way you weren't learned how to move your hands in a specific way. Right? Like think about a guy like floyd mayweather, right?

Speaker 2:          00:05:24       His hand combinations with his upper body. There are so precise. It's like that, that, that, that right? But with his legs, is he as precise as he asked? Precise moving with his legs, his, his with his hands or his, the 60% or 70% or 80% lama chanko is probably po perfectly proportioned for his style with his ability to move, but also also his ability to box and hit you. Well, he's got both things going on at the same time with next level angles. So that's what I was saying. Fuck. When you're younger in Cuba, they picked you. It's not like you

Speaker 3:          00:05:57       wake up and go, I want to be a wrestling. No, they look at you and go, you look like he could go, go wrestle. And like what I was hearing back from them in the early seventies it was like they just took you away from your family that and that was part of your training. You know your, then they put you in there. Go. We had no, you know where you train and like there aren't me. Have you talked to y'all about this turn you well yeah, like no. We've discussed what this thing is. I already have graphics on the podcast, so I figured that I put them up and we'll do a podcast in Spanish with fucking subtitles. Like an English film, like a, like a Giulini movie, whatever one of those movies. People think that unique. Okay. You have it because his, his English is too rough for me and I know what he's trying to say and the frustration in his face.

Speaker 3:          00:06:46       I love you. [inaudible] being so now he did a tape the other day of him in Cuba waiting for Biz, being in Cuba. Went to Cuba. No Romero's back. See if he's fine, but what is the, see if you can find he's, he's nuts. He's nuts. He's nuts. He's fighting rockhold now, which is a tremendous ride on the test. Right? That's a crazy fight. That's a crazy fairing. Good fight. It's very good fight. Rockhold when he's on, it's super dangerous. You know when the rockhold made one slip up against Bisping, but you know, fair play to Biz, Bang. He, he came into that fight regardless of where anybody ranked him, you know, like how, how they felt. His chances were he came in swinging. He has like, I think he had like 11 days notice, something like that. What was, how many, how many days notice that Michael bisbing get when he fought Luke rockhold?

Speaker 3:          00:07:38       I want to say it was something crazy low. It wasn't much time. You know, route clock. Luke rockhold is very, very good. He's a beach. Very, very good. His top game. Let me tell you something. I think when he fought Michael Bisman, I'm not going to lie to you. I think his focus was a little off, maybe two in a way. I think he was dating rockstars and hanging out in Hollywood. I think he's not dating or whatever anymore. Now he's just fucking, he thought when he beat a branch, he looked great. But his Jujitsu is great. He has great cakes. He's great with his hands, his movement, him against your, well, it's going to be interesting. Let's skip vicious kicks, man. No, he's four and he's won, right? So Luke Rock robot is number one and one of the five I believe so. I think this Joel [inaudible] is a four.

Speaker 3:          00:08:24       Yeah, it's a great fight. And then you got jocker raised back in the mix. You know what's crazy like I always say to you like, oh, I don't mean to pronounce his name wrong, and then some guy out, right? Like when he fought steel picking Dano whom God on when he fought my man. Immigrant mentality. Like a motherfucker. Yeah, he hits hard and all that stuff like that. But now that dude still going to be more dangerous. Now he's going to fucking take that loss. Batman man fucking machines. You got to think how crazy it is that he went from a guy who

Speaker 4:          00:08:55       was homeless too, five years later fighting for the heavyweight title. This is like a total amount of training, five years of elementary training, fighting for the heavyweight title, and he's the favorite. He's the favorite over geyser. He defended it twice. I mean, it's crazy. That's how talented he is. That's how terrifying is. That's how special he is. But Oh, a loss like that to a guide like that, like to a real champ like Steve Bay, if that, what's you realize where the top of the game is? There's another, there's a few more things to learn. There's a lot more days to get in and training, but that guy has just begun. He's just began five years ago. He didn't know shit. He's way better now than he was two fights ago. Yeah, I see the difference. I see the difference in the way he moves. When he fought overeem, it was since significantly different than when I saw him in his first and second fights is first, second fights.

Speaker 4:          00:09:49       He was very good. It's very, but just insanely strong. He would hit guys with these combinations and clean technique to matt. He's like, he's not just a physically strong guy. He's also very smart because he's learning to do everything mechanically. Very good. It's not like a guy who's only been striking for like three or four years, so they look a little tight and weird, but they can, if they land, they've got a lot of power. Nah Man, everything is clean. Like you said, some big of those trenches, Jack. Oh Dude. That type of work gets you a tough stuff. He's just a special athlete. And if he keeps going, man, I mean sh boy, that guy learning more to think about how little you learn in five years. Most of these guys have way more time in way more time in wrestling, way more time in kickboxing.

Speaker 4:          00:10:37       The average guy, by time it gets to the UFC, I would like to know what the number is like how many years of training and competing they have, but it's gotta be more than two. Like he was. He was like right in the UFC and smashing people. It's his amazing story, man. It's an amazing story and for a lot of people, the way it ended is a good lesson for martial artists. It's a good lesson. See what, even if you weren't in Gando Fan, you're bummed out that he lost. I appreciate that. I'm going in gone who fan? Fan Too, but I'm more of a fan of mixed martial arts. I, I'm a, I'm a fan of an honest, like extreme, like I wanna I want to know what it is. Like what, what is this like? What's this? What's this contest right here? What's, what's actually going on here. What's going on here is phenomenal athletic talent, massive potential, like Super Alpha athlete versus one of the toughest guys ever who's been in the game longer. Who knows more. He's wrestled. He's been fighting way more. He's been in the trenches way more times. He said dig deep. He knows what it's like to be really hurt and tired in a fight. She, I appreciate the strategy of like, how do you go in to fight a guy like perfect. It was like rocky

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       against Mr T. Yeah, that's what exactly it was like. So it was like heart and fucking a little smart. Stay away from that punch. It had to be, and I, I haven't watched the full fight, you know, I was working then I'm on fucking stage. My brother getting hit by Francis and gone and we put mma gloves night. Worst thing that can do a person, he's terrifying and steep. Bang, got cracked multiple times and not fight. It sound like he didn't get hit. He got cracked, but he had made up his mind. He was going nowhere. He knew what to do. He'd been there before. That's like, that's an incredible lesson, which is for the overall s the sport for the, for mixed martial arts in general. And the lesson is like, he figured out like he had like the craziest end of video game character ever.

Speaker 2:          00:12:43       Right? And God, I was like the big, like the big boss in a video game that like fuck, I got to fly. I got to play against this guy that's in Gansu and steep a figured out how to beat him being 20 plus pounds lighter than them. No Way. You know, way less intimidating in terms of his physical presence. All those tpa, it's pretty fucking intimidating. But in Ghana was so intimidating. He's so next level two 65 natural giant, crazy frame. You look at people when you're next to steep it. That's when you realize how big is too big. Fell on TV, you know, look that big when you're next to him and be like, this guy's a big fuck. He's a big function. You're walking around his asset is his mind though. Yes. Yes. Come on. Been fucking talked about the wikipedia page dog.

Speaker 2:          00:13:29       I told you the immigrant mentality with media page, listen, American ingenuity is fucking brilliant. And with the immigrant mentality mix, like let's say you're still an American, but it that could have called you steve. No, you could still call them steep and Mayo chick to remember where the fuck you came from. You understand me? His father came. That's really a win like that. You know it was on, I almost called you joe. I hate calling you. I almost called you to go. When was the last time you watched bronx tale? Oh, you know what? It's going on all week. I watched it a year ago with, he fucking finds him with the guns and he starts smacking the kids in the neighborhood. I still remember people's parents smacking kids in the, but wow. Like people's parents come in and go, what the fuck are you guys doing it?

Speaker 2:          00:14:15       Get the fuck home man. I'm like, won't kick. Got a kick to the stomach. And the father punched the other kid and nobody was said Dick, nobody set deck Dick. No, like I'm watching this Brian with a biker scene. What was the lab like? I, I haven't watched Bronx town 20 years. It's on AMC at six 30 and they locked the door and that you can't leave. He's eaten his shit and lost to the here's the bikes and shit and he walks over. Oh, okay, nice. Like a gentleman. Yeah, no problem Ben. You know what I'm saying? They do a thing and he walks up to the, I got to leave now you can't leave. And the collage euro, like that guy named son collage or

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       row who would do something like that. That means you, you want your son to have the immigrant mentality, but when they throw that beat of the bike, it's, it's a true story. That's a true, true story. I would listen in the 60s you couldn't have long and walk around the Bronx. It just wasn't accent really. Yeah. That, that hippy shit that, that, that, that did happen in the Bronx. And so what if like a hippie was walking through the Bronx, they called you dirty hair day, insulted you. They called you a bunch of shit and then they drew a beating on you. And it's hysterical because that scene is so accurate because after the adults drew have beaten on you, then the May book kids chased you like the young kids with sticks and that's what we do. Wow. You know, like the little guys would chase you and once you were beat up and they took all your money, it's a classic scene. I was thinking about that and I'm like, actually I got to call Joe and ask him one last time. Look at this. Look how bad to the bone that rather he stole with Joe. Whether he stole the scene or look at this, you go away.

Speaker 1:          00:16:01       I'm your man is Thomas. You got to leave. But I just tell him him so I think

Speaker 5:          00:16:09       green. That's it. We'll be on way looking for trouble. I appreciate it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:22       How can all this come together? So got them around, right? Yeah. Oh, this is a great scene, but the scene, it's a perfect song, right? Perfect song. When he walks in, it's stretching the beginning to the goon. Go Watch it. Is this going to get us kicked off of you? No, no, no, no, no. As long as we talk over it. Okay. This is it right here.

Speaker 5:          00:16:56       You again. Oh, nice. I'll tell you what the fuck we leave. Watch the bites. Man. Shuts the door. I will never forget the look on their face to face just dropped all their courage and strength was trained right from their bodies. Got a reputation for breaking a boys. What? They knew that they made a fatal mistake this time they walked into the roll bar. This is real Joe Rogan. This was 1968 fucking Jeroma have urge shit. So this is a true story.

Speaker 1:          00:18:09       Jesus Christ. This scene was fucking brutal. This is it. This was one. This was allowed.

Speaker 6:          00:18:19       Two.

Speaker 1:          00:18:29       This is craziness, Bro. This was, this was the bronx in 68 69 and the neighborhood, you know like the enabled would tie hurry up to cops or people on the third floor with Tay. We could see the cops from the third floor. We could see the bolts coming down the street. You're like the whole neighborhood was in on it. You know what's interesting to me, like this is all from immigrants, right? Yes. It's all this was what they had to do because of not, but there's also a movie is about him dating a black girl. Right. And what that meant that the say I forgot how good this movie was. This movie's brilliant. Yeah. Shout out to Frankie Renzulli. Yeah. Um, this movie's a genius movie. Look at this. Watch my car. You know. Chazz Palminteri is great and it's fucking good. This is it. This was it. This was it. I forgot how good this is. Now. See the young guys now that's us. Right? Well, let's see what's going on now. You take this guy and we would fuck him up though.

Speaker 1:          00:19:28       There's like animals. Stop to think about it. This is it. This is how you were Italian immigrants. Spanish immigrants. Oh my God. This is crazy. Crazy. When you think about there, one generation removed from people came off a boat. Let me tell you what the other side of this here, here's the other side. Like, all right. The big thing was as we were, we came to move here. I remember that when he would come to the store, Frank Stahl, Mike Star was your friend and he would come to the store and there was a big room with that. Chaz stole these stories from him and put this together and there was like this little war going on, but not from Frankie. Rental ranking ritual is the other gentleman. There was somebody else that was just, that turned out to be some believe very big. And uh, but there's a story one time that a bike dude, old gravano money and Gravana was hitting him and when he fell off the sidewalk and broke his leg, so gravano one night went out and fucking did something like this.

Speaker 1:          00:20:22       I'm like with 20 guys, they beat up a bike. I don't know how true it was, but I still remember being five. Like if I could think, if you could put, hit me with truth serum, I, I could go back to being 1968, 1969 in the bronx. My daughter's five and my mother would send me from the dry cleaner that she owned to the corner where there was an place that had slices and Italian ice and shit like that. Right. Like I was allowed to walk to the corner at mercy on Treemont Avenue. Like I think about, I was looking at my daughter when I was watching Bronx. I'm going, I I, how different as time change. Like I was allowed to go to a liquor store with a note and get my mother Marlboro reds and bring them back in that neighborhood. We didn't live there.

Speaker 1:          00:21:12       My mother just had the dry, clean it up. There was a bookie numbers joint. That's why we had the dry cleaning. We were partners on the dry cleaner. You didn't know that? No. That's why I got scars on my face. I got bit by a German shepherd as a kid. Those three by one of the eyes. That's what we did when we came from Cuba. I lived in two oh five west 88th street and after my father died, my mother had a dry cleaner and that's what we were up. We were up in Jerome Avenue and Treemont and grand concourse and we had a dry cleaner and every, every weekend I would go up there and I would sit there with the fucking, I learned how to dry clean and they had black Mike Black. Mike was the guy that I ended everything, but he made the best spaghetti in the bronx.

Speaker 1:          00:21:54       So even the Italians came to he black. Mike Spaghetti. Really? Yeah. This was a, I knew all that shit when I was a kid because when you have a numbers operation, uh, you have to keep moving it around. The cops can't, so you have to every three or four, we should have to move it around explaining numbers to people don't know what the numbers is. A, the Parimutuel, it's a, the last three numbers of the Parimutuel, the track, which is the amount of track made for the day, soak them track, made six hundred and eighty six thousand four hundred eighty two thousand dollars a number for the day is for 82 and it comes out as the Brooklyn number. So there's three numbers a day. There's Brooklyn, the Bronx and New Jersey, but what happened was that was a big business until the 80s till the lotto came out and the lotto cut that in half, but before that, that was all put it a little different.

Speaker 1:          00:22:52       Little different immigrant neighborhoods all over New York City because as immigrants will one hope. Yeah, we know we want that money to get that refrigerator and the stove and shit like that. It's such a weird thing that they would gamble. Just $2 a day. Remember $2 a day when George thousand dollars yeah, I can do a lot in 1975 with $1,000 with two kids. My grandmother was obsessed with the numbers. Yeah, she was obsessed and she would always have like a number in her head that she thought it was going to be and it was like one off or something like that. It was like these stories she would tell you. What would you say to, what can I say? I was like five. I just remember it very distinctly. My grandmother went to jail for running numbers in New Jersey. She wouldn't, she wouldn't rat him out. So they put her in jail. So she made sweaters, gave sweaters to the guards. Mrs D,

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       She's the nicest lady. Did you feel that your grandmother had done time? What did you think? We didn't find out until I was probably like, I wonder when I found out, I think maybe I found out my teenage years and I was like, why? What the fuck people are good. It's the year where is a, I don't want to say my grandma's name out a respect, but people would say, you know, where is she? Oh, she went to visit her, her cousin, her. She wants to see her aunt and she was, you know, choosing the pokey for like six months. I forget how much time it was, but every time we'd go over there it was like some new excuse. See It in New Jersey then put you in New Jersey. They put you in jail for Gatling is bigger accident. They don't give you a ticket. You know, they would give you like a ticket and shit in those days.

Speaker 2:          00:24:30       I don't know what it's like now. This fucking the employee in jail for weed down in New York City. I don't fucking know. My grandmother was one of the few people I've ever known where I legitimately thought they had intuition. She has weird intuition. She would do things. It's real weird. Like when my mother was a kid, it was a rainstorm. It was like real bad rain storm and for whatever reason my grandmother decided to wake my mother up, take her out of her bed and bring her downstairs, some crazy hunched. She had the ceilings, claps like right above the bed where my mom was sleeping. So like pieces of, you know, it wasn't a lot, it was just chunks of plaster. But like, you know, three or four pretty significant pieces of plaster fell off of the ceiling. It was rain came through with the whole deal, like the ceiling game out.

Speaker 2:          00:25:19       Somehow or another, she had this idea in her head and it could be because she knew that the ceiling was fucked up and she knew it was raining hard. It was probably going to give in any way or she might've had an intuition and my fault. Everyone was always convinced it was intuition. Everyone's always convinced like she's looks a little bit psychic. It was always weird. It was always weird around there. She brought her monkey. She had a month in New Jersey. Yes, in north New Jersey. She had a monkey named Chichi and cheat you everybody, but my grandma, my grandfather made it keep the monkey in the attic. Yo. My grandma was crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:25:58       She had a monkey would open up packages a gum and chew gum. How or where the fuck she got it from him? I'm telling you, my grandma was crazy. Italian people had butches and they'd get you anything. She can't look game pigeon. She kept a monkey in the house, man. Do you understand what crazy then you remember monkey? Yes. Chichi. The monkey's name is cheesy bites you now. He never bit me, but he bit my sister. You Bet my sister. Yeah. Cheat. You would fuck you up. I think he bit my sister. I think he tried to bite my sister. I think it was one of those things they might have bit my cousin some when our family got pit ever touched him. I couldn't even see. I know Italian side. Yeah. That night she was crazy and once you give, no disrespect, but once you get those lunar texts, that option that they do have intuition, you're fucking done.

Speaker 2:          00:26:52       They start giving you the fish eyes, zoot don't do shit. You got to listen to all her cooking was from another planet. It's from another planet. It was like pure immigrant cooking. Like the pasta that was design. Yeah. You just sit there and go, holy shit just perfect. Just knew exactly what supposed to be in there. She baked her own, like she would make her own macaroni, should make our own Ravioli. She would stuff her own Ravioli. She'd be out there rolling and flatten out flour and shit, throwing the flower on top of, flatten it out. She was a wizard though. Usually get a monkey, call it cheating. It's gotta respect a little monkey and keep her head though. Either respectful for grandma. My grandma was a special lady. She was powerful. Once you give those,

Speaker 1:          00:27:41       listen, when I was a kid, man, I went to my buddy's judo school. I didn't join. I just went down there to see what it was like and it was hidden in union city. It was on seventh street, but I knew that my step dad played cards on ninth street on Wednesdays. Wow. Okay. I knew my stepdad played cards down there. They played baccarat. Okay. And they'd gamble in this little club and I had to be maybe 10 but because I grew up, how I grew up with the numbers, I always had my eyes out as a kid. When I went to judo, that man at the end, I got in the bus to go back and I noticed unmarked police cars and I went home that night and look bro, you know, made dog get Christie love used to be a show on ABC about a black chick that new martial arts and tried to capitalize on it with a system.

Speaker 1:          00:28:31       And she was good looking with an Afro when she was a cop that she'd come in and do karate moves on Wednesday nights at nine or 10 o'clock and you caught me at home watching get Kristy Le and I'll never forget that my stepdad was leaving that night. And for some reason, I know you're going to play it back home after that. And they looked at me, he was getting dressed a suit on. You have like the billy bad suit on and shit, you're going to play cards or five men, why are you getting dressed to the nines? And I said to him, I said, hey man, today I went down there to go to Martins judo school and I saw a bunch of them marked cards down there. If I was you, I wouldn't go out to that. And He fucking just looked at me. He said, I love you. And he walked down the stairs, he got in the car, started it, opened the garage bro. And 10 minutes later I heard the car turned off in the garage close and they came up and he goes, I think you're right. And he made Sundays for me and him and next morning and that card place, I got rid of that. So now they would listen to me on the housing.

Speaker 2:          00:29:29       I had these fucking moron, my spouse. But you want me to tell you what else I did?

Speaker 1:          00:29:35       Joe Rogan, like this is me and like me and my stepdad had this weird relationship. I got to an age where I wanted my mother from myself. You know what the feeling is dry on when we've all gone through it. When you lose a dad and your mom remarries that comes up a day that he's not going to tell you what's going on anymore. And you know what? I just want you to know that I, I'm the mother fucker that runs this joint. You might be sleeping with my mum, but I run this motherfucker. So once I gave him that advice, like it really for a while, then him and I would go in a float. I kept stealing his coins from the center. He had this sand Laszlo thing and that was everything to him. So he had this big bottle of like scotch that was empty and he would put silver dollars in there and I would steal them.

Speaker 1:          00:30:20       And from time to time he would come home and go, that bottle's looking like somebody's stealing my car. I destroyed his mind for you because he was a very particular man. So he had different bundles of, but I gotta tell you something, I respect them today because I saw him get out of the joint and I show what he did with bookmaking and how he became part of, it's on a butcher shop. I started businesses, he started different businesses. So, uh, after I saved this that night with the backer, rocky would listen to me. And then one day I went and I signed up for biddy basketball and union city. And they used to give, you know, like now if you sign your kid up, you got to pay any dollars. In those days you just show up on an address and they gave you a tee shirt.

Speaker 1:          00:31:05       They put you on the team and they gave me a number. They said, like, you didn't say department of recreation. And it was a purple shirt. My number was 57 I walked into the house and he goes, what do you got there? And I go, Oh, I joined the basketball thing and he goes, what number is he goes, 57 Cubans again, a very superstitious 57 he goes, put a number on that. And he picked up the phone. I go five. He called some guy and he goes, give me five 57 for $10 guess what happened? Joe Rug. What happened? The number came up. No, I really had them under my spell. Right. The Fuck Anissa had this motherfucker at the age of 12 so he wouldn't listen to me. How old was the guy? My step father Juan at the time was 47 did not drink gig, did not drink, did not do drugs.

Speaker 1:          00:31:54       Carry the straight razor. Joe Rogan straight razor to cut people in. Yeah, and he used to cut. He used to web carpenter pants with the straight raise. At this point, the guy had money. He would have a gold chain. He'd wear a Chinese tee shirt, which a lot of people do not know what it is. That's what real pimps were. That silk and made shirts from China that you went and they have three little buttons. When when you were real motherfucking Spec, you cut those buttons and you get your initials and you put them in gold with diamonds in it. That's how spics ran in those days. Well, and uh, once I had them there, Joe Rogan, I had him, he trusted me, he trusted my eyes. So one night we're in union city and I fucking went somewhere. The walk back,

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       there's a place called pastoral music and there was next to the new moon Chinese restaurant. And I show a bunch of unmarked cars and I never forget that. I went back to the bar and then he'd go out and I told him, I said, dog, I saw three on my, like I had him and I seen, I seen three on my cars up to corner. He was very always scared of the phone, even though he was a bookmaker, he never used the phone. Joe Rogan never used the phone. And he would never have a conversation close to a phone. This is because he always felt he didn't not like phones. He did everything like a pigeon. His, he would write the numbers and the little piece of paper real small and fold them up and put him in his hat. And if he ever saw cops, he would just eat the piece of paper.

Speaker 3:          00:33:25       He didn't give a fuck. He always had the piece of paper somewhere close. Sometimes you would put it in this ring. This motherfucker was a savage dog. Oh my God. So that night the cops were going to jump on us on the bar, but it was for a drug thing. It wasn't for him. But when I went back, I told him, listen to cops are up the corner and me and him, he grabbed me by the hand and him and I walked from 29th in Bergen Line, the 58th and Bergen line down the Hudson telling different borrowers that there was going to be a raid. Like that's how are untrustworthy. He was a phones. And by the time we got back to the bar, we got raided and there was a dude in, his name was Monina. Right. Monina is those, uh, those crazy Cubans that Albert Albacore Monina means good man.

Speaker 3:          00:34:13       Like y'all my bra. Yeah, the albacore there. They don't need pussy and dental. He puts it here and they fucking, you can't fuck around with animals because of Saint Lazarus. Know that show. They have a very specific religion. They have their ma, it's a manhood. They were longshoremen and Cuba and they maintain order. So we have a fuck up. They'd come over and fuck you up there. But he had a wig. I'll never forget this. The Guy Monina had a wig and the cops were there and they threw him. And I'm like, 12 dog. I'm up against the wall. This search and made through that search and my step dad, they got my mom and they went to Monina and they searched him and the cop looked at his work and he goes to check the wig and they pulled the wig off and he had a little aluminum foil weed, cocaine.

Speaker 3:          00:35:01       Oh my God. That's hilarious. That whole bookmaking numbers world is fucking nuts that I grew up in. I love it. Still. I love, I wonder what it's like that there's no business in it. It's unfortunate because you think about how many bets are placed. Oh, Jesus Christ. I mean, there's so much money, so much money out there. People love to gamble fucking games when games are on. People love to gamble. What do you think is spent this weekend, Jamie? Come on. [inaudible] question Joey. Like why is that a problem? Like what? What? What is what's helping us by letting them regulate that shit.

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       Like why? Why does that happen? Why do you have to have a license to gamble? Why? No, if you think someone's not paying their taxes and you can prove it, is it because it's money? It's cash that's been thrown around mostly like what? Why is it an issue? The government's got not getting their piece.

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       It seems ridiculous that grown adults could tell other grown adults that can't gamble, but you can hear but you can't there. Oh, gambling is one of those things like legalization of marijuana, legalization of fucking cocaine lately. Lization of anything, Bro. You know what? There's going to be fucking winners and there's going to be fucking losers. My friends, two years ago, Connecticut did, uh, did an expo say on 60 minutes about women who have just lost death. Fucking mine's gambling. I don't know. He can sudden because they installed, no, no disrespect the Mohican Sun at Casino Industries, they installed these type of slot machines that could just fuck what your mind what? So these women were going down there and losing fucking mortgages. Houses. You know, I was like a John Waters movie, the dog and that dog. It was just something that, listen, listen, listen. Let me go. Let's go.

Speaker 1:          00:36:54       Let's get something out of the way here. The biggest percentage of degenerate gamblers are usually women. Let's look this fucking percentage up here. Women go fucking deep. That's a fucking hole. They don't give a fuck about nothing. They, they fucking play cards. Women fucking bang it out. Wow. And they bang it out while you're at work. Joe Rogan while I'm at work. They start with a horse. Then they go to this. You know those little promos they do, and in Jersey, what did they say when you know when Atlantic City was Atlantic City, you went to union city, right? You pay 15 bucks to get on a bus. They gave you a coupon book and when you get to Atlantic city, they give it $15 in quarters back. So that basically driving you to fucking gamble and drive back. I believe in gambling. I believe in making your living. I believe that it's an itch. It's an illness, whatever, but when you're losing your house, there's got, that's where I want to know where. That's where it bothers me. It's just like cocaine. It's just like a drug abuse. It's just like the opiate problem. It's just not any even fucking thing else. It could fucking, you and I both know people who have lost their fucking lives. Gambling. Okay. You've seen people in pool halls. You see how they get Joe Rogan. There's no difference in the drug addict and the gambling addict. Not at all, no difference

Speaker 4:          00:38:18       there. It's just a scary too, because they're conscious. It's like if you've seen the drug act, you see him, he's shooting up or whatever it is, and you see him fainting, you go out of their poor bastard. But when you see a guy who, who's fully in the grips of gambling, trying to figure out how to make, get his money back, and he's all jazzed up with adrenaline, doesn't understand why,

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       see there's gamblers like Michael Jordan. Then there's gamblers like Joey Diaz, this gamblers who have the means to gamble. And that is a fucking killer. Also like on Michael Jordan, Michael Jordan. And I'm not saying nothing bad about Michael Jordan accusations that you hear that he even bets on his own while I'm one basketball games. I think it very, uh, he was very, uh, competitive, but now how Joey Diaz was doing it, not how people, Charles Barkley lost nearly $30 million gambling it to us. He's this Charles, uh, uh, Joey, how much money is, tom asked how many people did you grow up? But that will, like Joey Diaz did not have the means that when 19 years old. Okay. And One night they put a 10 time better than a fucking knick game and they won $50 when you're 19 $50 is a lot of fucking money. That's a lot of fun. So now you think you got the world by the balls.

Speaker 1:          00:39:32       So you do it again on Friday, Saturday, and now you enter this world Joe Rogan that gets dark. It's, it's a instead of the drug addiction, alcohol addiction, every morning you wake up like his today, my lucky day. It's like the people who go to the seven 11 every day and you're trying to just get a pack of rolling papers. You're just in a rush. You just left your Jitsu. You just want to ruin papers and water. If there's a guy in front of you and he's telling you, give me three 68 four 60 fours and this poor fucking whatever gives them 20 lottery tickets and it's $118 this is what this guy's doing everyday, seven fucking days a week. My friend and he bite, he might be winning $200 a fucking week, but every week he's getting deeper and deeper into a fucking hole because in your mind you think today's your lucky day and it's never, you're lucky.

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       I was in that hole when I was 19 dog and I saw a friend lose any Dallas and when you're 18 years old and he had to get three jobs and I never really fucked with that again. I learned that addiction, that shit left my world early. You know, it was a degenerate loser Gambler, John Gotti. He wanted, because they brag, that's that conversation in mind. They may know who I'm still fuck got away from me, you know I have no fucking idea. If I had fucking Michigan and the hook, I would have made 30,000 they lose 80 90 200,000 in a weekend that the system is designed to bury the degenerate gambler like from from August 15th look at this John Gadi secret obsession and that wage 600 bets and scrabble and a $3,000 monopoly. Buyin you have no idea. Guys did the generous for like eight for like seven months. I played this fucking ugly game Joe, but I would start I the action.

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       I knew that you had a bet on Monday nights and try to win and you know what? I lost every week and all these people show you information. Listen, Arch Lisa played the fucking game, lost Pete Rose and lost even Michael Jordan and loss. There's room is that, that's why he was asked to play baseball for a few years because there was a cover up again. I did not write this. This is just things I hear on the road. Everybody has a fucking boat. Gambling grabs you fucking weird bro year and it grabbed me for a long time. I kept thinking that was the day and I kept betting 40 times what's touching me. If they had a problem playing scrabble, they would call up the parker brothers hotline. Dick Mobsters would to dispute the rules.

Speaker 1:          00:42:19       Then explain and what those fucking Lami is a word. It's a word Joe. Stop means is not a one stop. Mean kids don't word Wiki. Wiki, Wiki Dude, he told me they stopped me. That's why they would get into arguments about garbage. Man was a real word. Garbage man cafe. You know?

Speaker 3:          00:42:48       Oh my God, gambling is a fucking nightmare and once you get caught in the web and you enjoy rogue and shuts me down, then I start putting batch with Jamie and then pretty soon I start plucking, dipping into accounts and pretty soon now you're done. Now you get forced into a bad hand. I told you that I was a backer on the road for a while. My friend Johnny B, when I started making money doing standup, I put together a little bankroll and me and him would go places and gamble and he would win or lose. You know? Sometimes he'd win. Sometimes you lose, but it was just uh, being an action. It was fun. You know, that kind of gambling. Like I was never good enough to like play those guys. But I could play like people that were like my level and you'd bet like 20 bucks or maybe if you want to get crazy about like 50 bucks. I never bet like a lot of money gambling on pool, but it makes you think more, it makes you play like way more serious. It's good for your game. And if you can have a friendly sparring partner, they play friendly games like maybe a race to seven for 20 bucks. So it's costs you probably in any city pool halls, I don't know what the rate is per hour, but they gotta be like at least 20 bucks for once and for all, I want you to break it down from it.

Speaker 3:          00:44:06       I walked into a pool hall with Jamie. Yeah, I got 10 g's cash in my pocket. Jamie's my main man. How do I exactly make money and why is it that the people the room passing money around and how does that money get dispersed? It was real simple. Everybody puts like you put in, I'm in for 120 matches one, it depends on who's putting it together cause they might decide to just in all their money

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       like everybody put in on one side pool in money and you know, and and back this guy or they might be betting on the side. They might not even be playing the game. There's always a side bets. Side bets are probably more like if you had a bet, if you had like a big pool game right? There used to be a place called uh, w what is it? Western billiards. I think in New Jersey, west end, I think it was called, we'll see if you find west end billiards. It was a world famous pool hall. We would take the drive from, I'm from New York to go down in New Jersey to this famous pool hall that would have these like serious high level professionals play there and real high level hustlers from all over the country would go there for big money games. You go there and watch people play for $5,000 $10,000 I mean the best in the world would be there all the time.

Speaker 4:          00:45:23       I got to play against some of the best in the world. They killed me, but I got to play again against him. Like real good guys. Let's say into the tournament, you and I, you and I are in the tournament and you are a Efrin Rayez the greatest of all time or earl stricklin or Johnny Archer and I'm just Joe Rogan. I barely could play. It doesn't matter. I put my money up, I entered the tournament. I can play against you unless it's a huge, huge like where you have to get invited so that those joey dee has come onto the side and go, listen, I'm putting three to one hud's on this. Sure. Some people definitely, definitely. That's a side. Yes, I, that's all. I don't know how the pool, we got 100 bucks on archer. You know, you'd never seen this diaz kid play. I've got a hundred ideas and dudes, I'll take that, I'll take that and then you just work it out and everybody works it out.

Speaker 4:          00:46:08       But when sometimes guys will get together and back somebody to like say if you got it like a friend, it's a really good player and this guy is coming in from out of town and he wants to take a crack at him and go, well he wants to play $100 sets. Okay. And then you have to think how many barrels do we have? You Pool your money together. Okay, we got four barrels. That means if he wants to play sets we can lose four times. So you have to be able to lose a couple of gain. A couple, like if you're going to really play a guy out, these guys would play 10 12 hours. Then we keep going back and forth and back and forth. It's, it's, it's crazy. Like I've seen guys and you would see him the next day. They'd still be playing. You'd go there in the morning, they'd be playing all through the night.

Speaker 4:          00:46:46       I don't know what the fuck they were on. Most likely some sort of emphatic means. That was a big thing and the pool world for a while, guys would just break each other with gambling. It would just, it would be about who quits. It wouldn't be about who won. It's very rarely about like, you know like you would, you'd be, you would be frowned upon highly if you left on top. Say if you're ahead by 500 bucks and you want to quit me and, and I'm still ready, ready to keep playing, I still got more money, man. Let me win my money back. If you just walked away, Nope, I've got what I wanted. I'm going to leave now. Like that would be, you'd be what's called bad action, but guys, I've got two kids are having to get up at seven and go to the pool hall. Motherfucker with two kids. You're not playing that kind of pool. There ain't nobody would two kids playing that

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       level pool in pool halls like gambling, it hustled pool maybe now there are, this is actually a few guys, I take that back. There's a few guys with kids that are top of the food chain because the pool hall mile from my house, whenever I get, whenever I go into Hollywood now I can't do her. Okay and no more, so I got to go a long way and I get off. I'm victory just to see it fucking always felt with the generous. I'm petrified to pull in there. Sometimes places we're home to me, he's always told them talking about right next to the Strip club. Is that on victory? Right when you exit then there's a strip club right next to a ball. Well, I know the only good one in this area. I shouldn't say the only good one. The only good one that I know of.

Speaker 2:          00:48:10       His house. A billiards in Sherman oaks. I like this area. Have you been? You been on the one on one? Have you seen what that place is that where you took me there a couple of times to eat. We did comedy there. Remember Hollywood billy and you took me there. Yeah, it's fucking a building. What is it now? The goal then next time. What does it look like? I don't Joe, next time I drove by and I was like, oh my God that we did comedy that to eat dead with the a couple times we played pool there are a bunch of tiny chip time. Bunch of times that place was fucking done. That whole area is completely, that's where I met. Crazy. Max are bully. Really? Yeah, like that dude can play some fucking pool. Ooh, so when you play Max separately, how much drive to pull it up guy?

Speaker 2:          00:48:56       He's still put them on the one I would get tortured. You would have to bet like that. I would go to, you're never going to bet on me. Like a guy like Max eberly. He's top of the food chain as far as his technique and delivery. He could win a world championship tournament. Like legitimately he's that good. I have no chance. Like if if we played 12 games, I might win a couple. I might get lucky and win a few. Maybe I went for, he's getting way more. He's going to get to 12 for sure quicker. It'd be a terrible bat. The bat would be, how many games did I get too? That'd be the bat. If you say you'll never get past three because a guy like max tablet can run 10 racks in a row and I'm not exaggerating. I've seen him do it.

Speaker 2:          00:49:34       Blam breaks, runs 10 racks in a row, but to the point where you're sitting there, he did it in Vegas. We were all hanging out. I think it was man was an Ari. I forget who came with me. How could you forget? You guys are going to the Italian place. Yes. That place was amazing and that's exactly what Max Max's plan. He, he would break and run out on guys and they would just get frustrated. They'd be like, what the fuck man? They just get, didn't get to shoot. We watched him. He was gambling some guy and when the set was over, the guy was just pissed off because Max wouldn't miss. It was crazy. Just watch him. He's playing a guy that really just wanted to take a chance and play like a top of the food chain guy and he gambled with them. But just watching the difference between a kid who can play a little pool, it's pretty good versus a world championship caliber pool play.

Speaker 2:          00:50:25       They're so precise. I, because technique is so clean and his angles are perfect and he's just efforts effortlessly move in the cue ball on the table to where he wants it. He sees clusters and problems. Wayne advance and breaks them up. It's so high level. That's my boy. That's Max Albert Lea. He taught me how to play pool. Uh, not that I didn't already play it before I met him, but he taught me how to play it way better, way better. He made my game, I'm way more uh, technical. He was explaining things that I was just guessing before and he was explaining what was wrong with my approach and like what was the, what's, what's a better way to do it? He's a wizard when it comes to technique. Got He can make a living going from pool hall to Pool Hall. No Way. Cause he's that good.

Speaker 2:          00:51:08       He's an artist too. Fortunately for Max, he uh, he makes pretty cool artwork like um, a lot. See some of it's probably on his instagram. [inaudible] pool cubes or something? No, no, no, no. Max does pool cues. Ooh, somebody along the way. He said he makes like fucking eight jeep. Oh, Judy's ivory. Eric. Chris. That's my boy. Eric from shake the tree. Somebody. That's what I play with. I played with his cue. His cue is a, he's a wizard man. He's a guy who's like really into like the grains of woods. He's really into like patterns and he thinks of like, to him what is like mesmerizing. He finds like the most beautiful pieces of wood and comp combines and together and they have to have a certain harmonic frequency. Like he drops him on a safari cement for just like Dank, Dank. Like he wants to hear a certain sound from the wood, otherwise he won't use it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:01       He's like finding logs on the side of the highway and shit and recognizing some weird hardwood that no one's ever used before. He cuts it up and execute out of it. He's a wizard, like his cues or for Dan, he doesn't give a fuck. He makes as many as he wants. You know, sometimes they don't make them for awhile, makes them first. Friends won't let me pay for one after I have to pay for everything, just to not feel terrible. He's like the nicest guy ever. Play some fucking pool too. So I don't even know when this podcast started. Amazon, it's happening. It's funny. Before we started, we were talking about uh, yeah, 4.8 billion. I'm like, well 3% will happen in Nevada. Only 3% so most of it online online was that Chris Christie thing you pulled up earlier. James, listen,G and banks, banks, there's still people who are like a, you know they have, they got a ton of loot. Chris Christie goes to the Supreme Court on sports betting. Is he trying to get sports betting?

Speaker 3:          00:53:02       Yeah, he lives, they passed something in a Jersey I think in 2011 to allow betting and sports, but it's still only a lot of vegas because of the whatever law there is back on your team, Chris. Yeah. All right, so he has a few problems, but we all do 17 states also with them on this. I think I want to do it so he would want, he opposed it. They wanted again, they want betting again because they have an NHL team in Vegas and that's always been like the, the logic is that there'll be some issue, whatever. You can't not be betting where their sports being played because someone will throw the game. Everybody should be able to bet every city she'll do whatever you want to. We're going to talk to you going to do these games though. These, I'm fascinated by these games you see or hypnotizing ladies and going crazy, losing all their, their money. That was 60 minutes did a whole, he bought a whole piece on these games are like laser ish and people actually put the percentage was higher. Most women because of its, uh, so let me explain something to you. It's your view. You know, it's just uh, it's like video games, more like gambling. It's very fucking so addictive. Like a video game, but also the gambling very game. So that's what the beef was to remove these type of games because I'm telling you since I was a kid, I always first off,

Speaker 6:          00:54:25       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:54:26       I lived with my mother. She had a lot of proms, shovel out your rate issues, but she was a degenerate gambler on baseball

Speaker 3:          00:54:36       between the Boston Red Sox and the New York mets. They killed it. They killed her. And I saw the decline. I saw what did that, I saw a person watched two baseball games at the same time. I remember in those days you didn't have a split screen and direct TV. So if you were Puerto Rican, you took one pv and you put it on top of the other TV and you got fucking MBC and you had cable with it, came with the cord member with Hbo, still had the cord to the fucking thing and it was a thing with a box that you pressed and you switched three levels in those days may be there was no edit and there was no aba package or NBA package. You got like one other game. So we would pray that it would be the Boston red sox and she would watch both fucking games and gamble at the same time. Not, not even that. The numbers, if she had a dream about a goat bad. If she had a dream about going back to Cuba, Bam. Your family, if she had a dream about, um, seeing her daughter, Bam, it was a number they would call her. They would call her at a quarter to three because she had all that, all those contacts. So that was that gambling. Then there was the, then there was the track addiction.

Speaker 6:          00:55:55       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:55:55       Which started at aqueduct in the afternoon. If the sun was shining, that was my excuse to go to aqua duck from my mother. Let me go to act with duck pasta. You had three after school and she'd be there at three but the whole time she'd be scratching because the meadowlands started at eight

Speaker 6:          00:56:12       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:56:12       She knew she could catch the metal lands at eight so guess what happens is, is that if you lose the eight o'clock meadowlands what? You haul your ass to yonkers with the death of death. This is

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       where you go to before you go to a pool or this or your blood. You go to yonkers raceway. Do you understand me? Have you ever been to yonkers raceway? Yeah. You leave there with a corner, the one where do you think you're going? You either going to sell your soul or give you a blood. She'd go shoot pool because you're saving the day. You cannot go home a loser. Right, right. There's all day gambling. Oh my God. So that was her thing. So I also grew up in an Italian family that the mother was a chow away. It was like a fucking act. It was like an act. She had three kids. They were tremendous kids. I knew the husband, he worked for a big corporation, they drove a nice car, they went to church. But on Saturdays when I go over there, I would always go with your mom and they'd go, my mom plays cards with uh, with the Rogan's and uh, and this name.

Speaker 1:          00:57:20       But why as I got older one day somebody said to me, don't be careful when you go over there. Why they might shoot that lady in the head. She knows like 600 down. I mean, and when I was a kid, I was like 13 and somebody came to me, they said, be careful when you go with it because the mom's a little bit on the those card games. And then as I got ahold of, they're scared for your life from a card game. Magic being scared for your life. Well, it was a different game. That's how they suck you in. So a lot of the people now, I also grew up with men, degenerate gamblers, but I know all of the symptoms. I know the itch. This, this thing on 60 minutes just spoke about this addiction with uh, a computer thing with women. That was it.

Speaker 1:          00:58:03       That was really interesting, but I know how it fucking creeps up on you. It's not a couple of years ago it's called the slot machines. The big gamble. Oh, so it's just slot machines in general. These type of slot machines. Computer ones, yes. They have an effect on women in particular. Maybe. Man, the fuck up ladies. How about that? No dog. Here's my take on this whole gambling thing. Like you remember horse bedding in New York? Like you'd go to the horse, you could go to the track better. Yeah, it was right there. Right there. They made that for a reason. I mean it just trying to make it legal. This is legal. Come on. It says legal. It's not legal. It's to take a piece. Jerome, they want that piece. Have you been to a medical marijuana store recently? No, I haven't. Okay. What are they like, if it's $60 your tab is now $76 cause the tax, it's $16 in taxes. If you buy something for $60 the thing about weed though is it goes so far I think about how much like $100 worth of weed goes. You could be on the moon for three days for three days. You could be on the moon with the proper edibles. Get a $100 worth of the proper edibles. How much do you think you can handle? How many jumbos do you think you can handle? Do you ever have a Jon Boat? Okay. What do they have

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       like just depends on I think a hundred to $200 yeah dude, I fucked up. Need a half a jumbo. Once my, I felt my cells, I felt all the cells in my bones. I felt like were the tendons connected on my spine? Like it's like you could get fucking blasted on and then the last 12 hours and then take the other half. That's another 12 hours for other taxes higher than Las Vegas. Jamie. Then they aren't here for week 35% here. How much? 35 and what's in Vegas? It's high, but it depends on if they chase the motherfucking game dog like yes, no more stars or death. That's so silly. No more. Hello, she's the Tkos. I bought the final fucking, I got a the towel. I'm like Pablo Escobar. I got a fucking cache of the ones I ate this morning. Those hello? The Tk hose. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:00:14       Yeah. You can't find them. But I got to college. I got the league. They become like Cuban cigars. Oh my God. Like Cuban cigars now. So some people are just going to keep going. There's no more. Like I told people, there's no more stores, but they stars like people going fucking bananas now. Cause now you guys, you got to see the like I only go to w two weeks doors, but I go to one that's by the book and I go to war that they just said, you know what? We're like steeping Mayo check. We don't give a fuck. This is immigrant mentality. We opened at six, we close at 10 we give away free bagels. If you come at six o'clock and you got to see it, that rock rocking the road, they're going to sell those 200 milligram stars. Tow people go down to fucking end.

Speaker 3:          01:01:02       Wow. Or the dea comes in and shuts him down. They don't give a fuck. That's too, like if you're on Ventura Boulevard, you gotta be really cool cause you're done. I don't think there's anything wrong with having a limit on the number of milligrams. If that's going to keep it legal, it's in. That's also, they just grow a lot of people that are jumping at black pocket. That's it. You know how much it cost. You know how much it's gonna cost of stars that that dude just stay open. How much? A half a mil. Oh my God. Because it's 70 grand just for the license. Cheap money. They take that, they take that paper up in front, that like led Zepplin. They're like Peter Grip and 1975 the economy's going to improve and they're still gonna kill. Oh No, no. He's going to improve of when I tell you what, how much are they going to take right off the target of the tape.

Speaker 3:          01:01:46       Bang it. They looked at Colorado's thing and said, listen, we'll cover that with steroids. Were coming in with H, forget what they're doing. Listen to, we're doing just to set shop now. We don't care if you've been in business with nothing just to set up shop. We got to get a piece of the actual okay fine. If they just, they work deals out with banks and made it easy and acceptable for these guys could put them, but it's right. And a lot of places it wasn't, they were dealing in cash. They hired, especially in Colorado in the early days, they had a higher, a lot of like Spec ops guy. I love saying in Spec ops like, I know what the fuck I'm talking about. Just sounds cool. Um, they would hire like former seals and shit and then they would have to carry the, the, uh, the money to the bank cause everybody knew there was like giant sums of cash.

Speaker 3:          01:02:34       So it made it very dangerous. They weren't allowing them to use banks or credit cards, rather, they weren't allowing them to, you know, sell. We would credit cards, but they selling weed and credit cards in a la medical in the 90. [inaudible] the hot store when you turned me on to my license, the hot store at the time, which they're not there. Know that dude at the height of it was walking out of there everyday with 25 gram by himself and cool life. Wow, that's dangerous. He was a, but you know what, he was just dumb as fuck when the dea came in to have that cash in the safe right there that they just swooped on it. I knew a guy who got shot. He was a really nice guy and he used to work at the Inglewood wellness center and a, this was the early days of, um, the medical legalization.

Speaker 3:          01:03:22       It was like, I want to say it's like somewhere around [inaudible] 99, somewhere, somewhere in that range. 2099. And, um, he apparently was coming out with a big bag of cash and someone shot him right in the stomach, took his money. They didn't take care of them. So I took all the cash. There was nothing to hire people. You had a higher piece. You've got to hire people, you know. I see, I see amateur mistakes. Yeah, I saw this Jamie. I see amateur mistakes constantly. For example, the store I'm talking about, he lost. He lost everything. Joe Rogan when you over, they will, he lost everything. He would any weed he got. This guy was an exotic guy himself. Like he was head when you're ahead, you love when somebody brings you. So he bought as much as he could. I love that expression I had. He was a head, nobody uses that anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:04:13       So what he would do is when you walked into this place, he would have 60 weeds on the wall and he kept all his weed on the property. When the feds came, it was like stealing. He had everything there, everything was there. One in the open. You have to have an apartment and you have to have an amount on the mouth. Six ounces. It's all you should have one week. If Jamie comes in and he wants eight ounces, give me 10 minutes. I got a pigeon that will bring it over here and 5 million right across the street. Then I got a little apartment, which a stash that you have a couple of saves. You have to, if the cops ain't going to let you deposit, you've gotta be fucking creative. If you read all these guys' stories, the hardest, the Joe Rogan, you ready for this expression? The hardest thing is what to do. We'll call him dick about that problem. Joe Rowe in Syria. Now. It's a real problem. No, no. Think about this room filled with her. Hello? What was the movie? I just went, oh, it's tomorrow. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just on a plane. You can, when you're on a plane

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       and Tom Cruise's on, you've got to give them the benefit of the doubt. Oh, I've got another bullet in me. I watched the barry seal thing. How was it? It's not an academy award winner, but it's very interesting when we're just burying money. Joe Rogan, 4 million a shot like me and you are the yard like burying money, like a suitcase with hundred dollar bills falling out of it and you don't give a Frenchmans fucked. I always wanted to know this snopes, this. Did Barry Seal die with George Bushes? Phone number in his pocket. That's what they always said and he died. They shot him on the way to the trial. What? George Bush, his phone number in his pocket. Oh, he was top notch. That guy. He had it all. He's seen it bro. He took pictures of them loading a fucking plane in Nicaragua with Escobar and the top eight and Nicaragua.

Speaker 2:          01:06:11       They had him by the fucking balls. No matter what. How you that took balls. Fuck. They fucked him in the ass. They told him that they wouldn't release the pictures. Then they release the pictures, which was Douche and that's why they got got shot. That's fucked up. They should have taken him and hitting him. He Fuck is interesting though. They assassinated that guy. That's a 100% assassination in connection to some sort of illegal government. It was the fucking come up whether legal, what are you talking about? That was escobar, that set the bird a message. They had a deal. We're bearing can seals could land though, right? Like it wasn't, part of the thing was with the people on the ground, the ground that was in mean. Here's the problem. This is where Eddie Bravo comes in. They were landing in those everglades, no quote me on this.

Speaker 2:          01:06:56       Right. And he broke it down for me and somebody else broke, broken down, made it be honest with you. And they were allowing that on your boys clock. Clinton clock. That's, that's, that's like theory, the whole thing. That's what you always be. His drops out, right about truth. Because the truth is fascinating. The truth, his two boys were murdered and uh, the, uh, car near the official report they gave to the parents was a, that they had fallen asleep on the train tracks. So a, the parents pay for some sort of an autopsy and it's revealed that the kid had been stabbed. And the one of them had been stabbed and then they find out that around that same area was where those guys would drop their drugs before they landed. They would parachute down their drugs, they would, they would like and they would land.

Speaker 2:          01:07:47       And these guys, they had dropped points where they would put their shit and then someone else would come by and pick it up on the ground. You've got coordinators and these kids apparently saw something they weren't supposed to see. So they fucking murdered these kids with knives. And then the coroner was all in on it. So they had to conduct some sort of independent. So that is what got this whole barry seal's thing going. It was this lady trying to figure out this parents trying to figure out what happened to their kids. You know, Joe wrote a fucking crazy story. You have to imagine, okay that these

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       guys were getting, you know, let's just draw a number. I, I mean I'm just an idiot, but let's just draw a number. And they were probably getting $4,000 per kilo. What would they put on those planes? And there was sending five of those planes over a day and dropping them in the Louisiana, and this is, listen man, I told you a thousand times in the podcast and 83 they found the bear dead next to a Duffel bag filled with cocaine and aspen, Colorado in the mountains because they would drop into fucking coke in the mountain. This is a very bad way. The coke and he fucking old deed is hard. Oh, what does it say?

Speaker 4:          01:08:58       Oh, okay. Barry Seal, seal it. Organize a sting operation where he managed to get photographs of Pablo Escobar helping Nicaraguan soldiers to load 1200 kilos of cocaine onto a seat, but 23 male, it's a plane. Soon afterwards, Reagan went on television with the photograph to denounce Sandinistas as drug smuggling, corrupting

Speaker 1:          01:09:16       duck duck bats, how much he was getting for that 4 million, 800,000 for one fucking low. Now here's the tricky thing. Here's what, here's what really pisses me the fuck off that I see narcos and I see everything, but now this is your uncle joey talking to you. Joe Rogan, please show me the good side of Pablo Escobar. No, no, no, I'm not gonna. No, no. There's no good side to Pablo Escobar and the Saint Lee Harvey Weinstein. This is a story that we have never brought up, but you have to assume. Okay, you, you see all these shows and the whole fucking thing and they were in bed for sure with Nicaragua. Yeah. Who else is in bed with Nicaragua?

Speaker 4:          01:09:59       Let me ask you this. Do you think that it is the actual CIA or is it people or if it, when it was, let's not even say cia. Dea. FBI named a bunch of fucking letters, put them together. Is it the actual organization? Whichever one it is that's bringing it in, are they complicit or are they're just cowboys? See the theory's always been that there's been these few cowboys corrupt guys. Maybe they get too close to drug deals to crow close to the drug deal, and then sometimes they get seduced like, cause there's a many, many stories of under oh under cover cops getting seduced by the actual lifestyle of being a criminal young kids. They probably did a little crime themselves here or there. They see some cops doing some dirty shit. They see him. Some guy, you know, there was a thing that came out about, was it Baltimore? What? What? What does the city where cops had came out and trial, they'd kept toy guns on them to plant at the scene of a, of a crime. Like if they just

Speaker 1:          01:10:55       shoots, there's a fucking toy gun in the big picture, the big world picture as an intelligent individual as you are the plant. It was planned in the sample. The CIA wanted a piece of their action and the dea was tricked into going down. That I really control a, you can't be this, and I'm not saying you as an American, you can't be this dump. So all the research that we've done, all the research that we've done with general north, he was in on the package with barry seal, the whole fucking thing. And here's what it gets even deeper. Let's talk about the deep disturb that, that nobody ever even looked at. And you have to think of, because I heard this story a thousand times, there was a guy by the name is Carlos laid that, that, that, that he got crazy. You know, they show him getting his dick sucked on the radio and uh, Columbia and everything and all these TV shows.

Speaker 1:          01:11:48       No, he was on an island snorting coke with long hair, talking like Jim Morrison and having fucking threesomes and the fucking, uh, their own cartel gave lay dare up to the law. They are to keep them off their back. It was five partners. It's me, you, Jamie and red band, but fucking red bands out there doing videos of him snorting coke with a fucking pigeon on this head. We can't have this. They gave the dea fucking Carlos that comp like calm things down for a while when the, in 83 and 84, when Reagan sent his troops down there, don't quote me on the dates here, but I will tell you as a professional cocaine sniffer, what was going on, and 85, the price of cocaine went skyrocketing and it wasn't, I'm sick and tie. It wasn't because of cocaine skyrocketing, it was because the cocaine was coming in.

Speaker 1:          01:12:49       But the toughest part was getting the ether alcohol and to Colombia to process it. The Colombians had got a tip that the uh, the, the troops were coming down to raid their jungles. Now what they had not told you in all these shows and research, but this is uncle joe is going to drop on you is what do you think they took? What other, they took some labs to Nicaragua and they shipped cocaine out of Nicaragua. But guess who else partnered up with them to your buddy fidel. Fidel was shipping it in. Yeah, he's going to be on the podcast and three weeks I can you imagine having for Dell I give you and Fidel, you told my God this whole block would have the snipers and fucking everybody. Fidel just walked in with a suit and you had to teach them like a UFC move and shit cause for Dell and come in and asked, you said you'll know getting the mixable westgate tech cause they were anyway, but they weren't serious man.

Speaker 1:          01:13:49       They went to very nervous in the presence of a guy like that lay dead said in front of Congress that he was getting 800,000 he was given Fidel 800,000 a shipload to come in under his flag at the time. She imagined being in the presence of a Fidel Castro, just being in his presence like if he was, you know, in his prime here in the room with him in his prime, no one he how he ran cube. We took it over. You have no idea. Maybe he would be destroyed. This terrifying to be arrested Cuban American. You have to hate the guy. I have to hate him, but as a man that thinks you have to see what his path was crazy again, that's where my man, Tj was, comes in with a van and knock toward the Ha, the revolution for how he started at three different places at once.

Speaker 1:          01:14:39       The revolution, it just wasn't eight monkeys that put on gorilla suit and went to the mountains of Cuba. He came to Jersey first, got arrested, went to Tampa, I got arrested. He was already passing out flyers. They always confuse Lee Harvey. I was, well, no, it wasn't Lee Harvey given out pamphlets. It was Fidel Castro get with a helper. That's a joke. Please don't quote it. The CIA. It's a joke. I'm not ratting. Yeah, Fidel Castro was in union city, New Jersey. I can't tell you the dates, but like I have my friend Colin to the podcast and tell you the story about Fidel talking to his mother on a daily when she would have waited to get on the bus. She was an Irish girl in union city and she goes, I know Fidel in 19 fucking 52 and you need city. Just think of what he did to the Italians.

Speaker 1:          01:15:27       He kicked everybody out. It's like, fuck your casinos. Mine now. It wasn't very brilliant movie started in the mountains. He fucking, he, he, you know, he just took over the little villages and then he changed their minds because blood, first of all, it wasn't an easy thing for to them to do. Battista was really fucking the country. He had really divided the country. You have no idea what racism was. Tow. You were in Cuban, 1955 black people weren't allowed in casinos. You have no idea. These poor people today, everybody's crying about, you have no idea what black rights were in Cuba for those black fucking people. They got no rights. So those people were poor. That was such a high level of dot. You see all these people dancing, but on the other side there was fucking famine, like people were fucking dying, so they wanted a change.

Speaker 1:          01:16:24       Fidel came in there as a hero. First of all, he came in as Cuba was going to change, but then he switched it on him and he aligned but Russia and he became a communist. That's what made it worse. That's what made it worse. Racism and hunger has always existed in Cuba. It did that. That was the problem that they always showed that party side of Cuba, but that other side of the island is probably, there is people starving. Wow. And Battista come on, but how do they keep up the tobacco production? That I don't know. I don't know. I was still thinking of that Joey, but now all of that, they had the best cigars in the world, but that people complaining now that they're not the same cigars. This is, some people are complaining, but a lot of people

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       getting frauds apparently. Apparently when you buy Cuban cigars from untrust and trustee people, you could definitely get some fakes because now they're talking about how the soil isn't rich. White people will go there as an expert. Oh, Bobby Kelly. Bobby Kelly's a real expert. Like he was on a Arusha fears podcast. They were talking about cigars. Bobby Kelly really knows his shit like he was, he was going in depth about how many fake cigars there are and how he can even kind of taste a fake cube. And he smoked so many cigars and he thought maybe one of ours was fake. He's like, maybe it might be fake ninth deals. No, I think this Israel, I think this is like, it's like he's like that discerning about that shit. Huh? There's a lot of weird freak. So when it comes to cigars, like people who are super into them, they get sued.

Speaker 2:          01:17:52       They get you high as fuck too. This is something that people aren't talking about. You smoke a cigar, you're like, whew, that's, there's so much nicotine in that. You had the Cuban coffee to it. Oh my God. It's how the process is supposed to go down with the Cuban coffee. That's a win we do. And you go deep, deep, deep in the only needs a little taste of it that a bull and a half of Alpha brain and you'll be there. You'll get the Jack Chappelle smokes it with uh, sometimes with cigarettes in it. We did it the other night in the back of the comedy store with cigarette and tobacco and done a couple of times to, Yay. Ooh, you get elevated.

Speaker 1:          01:18:33       It was, it was interesting. I got one time from San Francisco to Reno, one time from San Francisco to reno dog. The cops were looking for me and San Francisco and you go down to the, any of those tourists districts and they have like a bus that'll take you to reno. So I just jumped on the bus to reno at this check and this is 1985 when we're sitting in the bus and there's this Egyptian k, I'll never forget this and the back of it, you could smoke on the bus in those days. Cigarettes. So he had rolled a blunt with hash and tobacco when it got, and I had never done that before guys. I'm not going to lie. I had never even, I took two hits of that fucking thing. Dog. I had a puke in that bathroom. I got high as fuck. But that combination together, that tobacco, this we'd hash. He had the real,

Speaker 2:          01:19:27       yeah, that's too much. Rockwell Joey. That's a bit much for Uncle Joey. The first time I ever smoked a spliff was with Charlie Murphy. Charlie Murphy rolled them is his cousin Richard. We're on two. Charlie could role, he would, um, he would take a swisher sweets old school, you know, any kind of cigar paper and he would turn it into a joint with the cigar paper, which is like, you inhale weed, you never really inhaled those cigars. You, you could just kind of get them in your mouth and you taste it. Then you blow it out. But when you take a drag a weed, you open your lungs up and fill your lungs with the smoke. Cigar. Smokes too harsh for that. You don't, you don't smoke

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       like that for the most part. Most people don't. But when you do it with pot, you do. So you get this career easy blast of nicotine and the carets e blast a weed and you're like, wow, it's very different than just weed. I think I smoked. Yeah. Last night on the podcast, I took two hits off in front of mine, gave me one of those. I like those. And it was pretty fucking scared. I'm scared of us. I'm scared of my life. The ones with the cigarettes in them, I'm scared. No, no, no, no. I don't want no smoke. No, no. I'm not talking to cigarettes. But the ones with cigarettes and um, it's an interesting little high. It's like, Ooh, this is a new door to the room. It's a, it's interesting. That's what like smoking. One of the hardest things I ever gave up with smoking cigarettes after you smoke a joint, right?

Speaker 3:          01:20:53       That is just pure brilliance. When you hit a fucking joy and you'd take a little sip of coffee and after you smoke that through to you light up a Marlboro some life. It's life fucking changing bro. I know a lot of people love him after a real good meal. Well, the whole, it's the whole package. So I was like, God, let me ask you a meal. I meal a joint and then the cigarette and then another cigarette and a cup of coffee on top of that. Some dessert said another second. Right. You have no fucking idea. Cigarette scare the shit out of him. I'm pleased. [inaudible] body, I can't smoke them. My Tony's hooked. My blood pressure would be 2000 over 80 Tony says he can quit it anytime. A little fella. And you know what? What was the best one on one? What I realized was two years ago I shot something and I smoked that night.

Speaker 3:          01:21:48       I asked one of the camera guys, let me fucking get me a cigarette. And that next morning was when I realized how really fucking bad day are you felt terrible. Oh, how many of you have one to two cigarettes to Marlboro Lights? And I was fine that night. I did a comedy club and I was like, what the fuck is going on? And we all, and I don't want to smoke the fuck. No, no, I'd never do it again after that night in Chicago. I'll never do it again. I took one of Tony's ones before it show. Interesting cigarettes or interesting. It doesn't, it does a weird little thing to your breasts. It does. And that's one of the reasons why I did this because I read something about a nootropics are talking about um, different vitamin, like what's good for brain function. And one of the things they said that nicotine, nicotine is actually a nootropic and that they found that some people under the use of tobacco with the use of tobacco, they achieve like a, an elevated state of like certain functions of the brain.

Speaker 3:          01:22:44       Like it actually has some sort of a small measurable effect. So it really does stimulate the way your brain works. I don't see, for me it's different. I have to, it's a combination. Yeah. That's for me. Like I, I don't, I wouldn't just enjoy right now you can say goodbye itself, but the cigarette with the weed, but if that coffee was brewing hot right now and it was maybe 60 degrees outside with a little bit of wind and sunlight will, you know when you stand out in the sun you'll warm, but when you're in the breeze your little cool. You go outside and a good join us, some fucking tremendous reef with the sun hitting your face and you're taking a nice hit of a cigarette all combined or even, or even like, I like what I do, I took a cup of coffee, I'll pop a fucking number and then a little nicotine gum to give you a little gods, some blood prior to him. One blood pressure medication on top of that all together, it all works out. You know what I'm saying? If you take them apart and nothing really happens, I get it. But together, that's where you put them a fungo in. For me, it's a small shot of Jack Daniels and one to two hits of a joint before comics.

Speaker 3:          01:23:55       Just a little tap to taste. Just a little yikes. One Hand has really preferred. It's a smart move. Two inches. If you're feeling I did it. I did the Tequila the night w three points. Not Bad. Oh, well the weight watchers. Yeah, but how long are you doing the weight watchers? How long it, I started December 9th I went from three Oh nine to two 96 old. Excellent. But you know what, Bro? Here's the stupid thing. Joe Rogan. Here's the dumbest thing in the world.

Wait a second guys. I kind of bounce them swinging bats. I'm hitting the bag. I'm walking around the park. I'm still gaining weight. Something's not right. So it's the like the butter. I don't use bothering them. I could eat my piece of wheat toast with my eggs. Oh, you ready for this? Are off the other way. Ready for this rock. Throwing away the toast and just eating the butter. I don't like, I gotta have my thoughts wrong. Yeah, but eat the butter butter's good for you. Especially if it's grants thing. I get that. Yo. Hey Yo, no egg whites. I cut around them. You had a bit about that. None of those. There's a a thing in the news yesterday where they were saying that people only eating egg whites is a tremendous health, uh, deserve site. Listen, five years ago

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       it don't take a fucking moron. The time, 20 years ago, nobody was getting concussions. Nobody was getting soft. Nobody was getting their feelings hurt. This specialty men, all of a sudden I saw people started eating egg whites and I saw big rise and people having a hard time getting their wives pregnant. All of a sudden I saw commercials about erectile dysfunction. Men never talked about having men talked about bug. I did some bloaty at night and I didn't get my dick hard. Now all of a sudden there's a commercial on national TV primetime, some fucking guy saying that and awesome. They started dropping that low testosterone shit and I'm telling you dog, one thing about Uncle Joey, I've always loved egg yolks. I don't like, I don't even like mixing them. I think it's bad for real. I don't even like scrambled eggs. I'll eat them if you make them, if you make them nice to me with a little sour cream and a little milk and do it and run it.

Speaker 1:          01:27:03       I like it, but I don't like just prison. I got to see the Yolk. I got a rule. When you take me for breakfast, I always got to see the yolk, so I cut around it. The other day, the awaits. You set them. You've been coming here for a long time. You do not touch the white and she goes, I mean you do not touch it. I have become like a surgeon with that knife. I get the yolk perfectly. I take that wheat toast now I don't even eat the whole two slices of wheat. Those I only eat a half a wheat toast. I take one egg yolk and put it on one side and I eat the whole thing. Like Robert Deniro eight the fucking ag and and Angel Heart. When he wanted to scam Mickey Rourke, he just, hey, that's how I do it. I put a piece of bacon in my mouth and then I'd take the other piece of wheat toast, put the egg yolk on that.

Speaker 1:          01:27:51       I take the other piece of banking and they ate my fruit and that's fucking it. That's beautiful. I got ap Egg Yolk, the egg yolk, and as you can eat three egg yolks, but you could also scramble for eggs, getting a Tortilla, put black beans in it and the salsa. All that costs you is the fucking Tortilla dog. Why four points where you can have a full fucking point breakfast. I need a bowl of fruit and get brand fucking new dog. It's amazing. That's a great scene. A great download is creepy fingernails. Remember you bro. You much a mother for these two guys were such motherfuckers. It's so funny. Oh, from Brooke. How crazy. I don't believe in that Mumbo jumbo. I mean the top these guys where the basketball, he just told you believe that the ag is the symbol of the soul and some religions looking. You see how skin, I don't know, but this face when he's eating that ag, show me. Show me that again. That's a brief looking at Mickey. Rourke's raised handsome fella. Yeah, but poor fucking Mecca. Look at his face. Not exaggerated. That's the devil. That's about as good as a human being is ever going to an impression of what

He was definitely a Batman. Right? What was he on? Batman? Um, house on haunted hill. There's, there's his thing, house of wax that was a big one. House of wax was a big one. The last man on earth. He was always, it was like thought of, is that like real good creepy actor

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       guy?

Speaker 6:          01:32:01       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:32:01       Who's good in scary movies?

If he was in Vincent Price, he was in and [inaudible] funny how a guy gets like synonymous with a genre. Movies like Vincent Price. You think of it all scary movies. You know, there's a few guys like that. You think of their name. Oh, scary movie. You Know John Romero, scary movie. You know dawn of the dead.

Speaker 6:          01:32:27       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:32:28       That's filled.

Speaker 6:          01:32:30       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:32:30       Low TV on. That's his name, right? John Romero. John Romero did what? George Romero. John Romero is a guy who was a game developer and the early days of a doom, he was with id software like doom and quake and those kinds of games. No, George Romero was to guide that on paper. Officially started this whole Zombie fucking shit much, right when we were kids, the dead and the other one dog, he has what's seen in one of those that had to be 1975 I was maybe 12 years old, maybe 13 one of those came out and we took a hit of acid and we all went to the movie theater on a Saturday. Take the number one bus, Jersey City, and they would play two of these movies. Dollar Dan and something else, right of the living dead or something. Fucking that night of the living dead was the first one. There's one scene where the black guy's goal for the helicopter, they just chops his head off.

Speaker 3:          01:33:31       Jesus fucking Christ. I run out of the movies was scare the living shit. I Dunno how many times I took the number one bus to go to Jersey City, the Journal Square. There was a movie theater dog. That's why I saw Richard Pryor live at the sunset strip the first time on a Friday night I got stabbed. That's so nice. You got stabbed. He's got caught. I still got the scar. That's where I saw the pink panther movies. That was my first John. And to getting high and go into the movies. Like I knew I couldn't go to the movies and Wartburg and he didn't city cause I'd bumped into one of my mother's friends or something. So me and my little goombas figured out if we went to Jersey City, we could get on the bus, cause little drama, get the six pack, split it four ways and smoke a joint and go into those movies and Giggle and act like I'm an asshole. We also went down to the sea, the Groove Tube and Kentucky Fried and Movie Kentucky fried movie was a genre that stone for Saturday night live. And there was a movie put together by a bunch of sketches, but one of the famous sketches is the in a court room and uh, and there's a gorilla fucking people up. Yeah. They would just say different stupid things and the fucking guy go, yeah, that was loony. They Teddy's fucking do this movie today.

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       You too, by the way. This was on hbo where we were killing me. All right, Jamie. Oh my God. Yeah. This is on Hbo. So you had a talk to your mother and to get an HPO because groove tube or Kentucky fried movie was going to be on and they were hilarious. Could never have this movie. Yes, she's good. And gang triggers. Yes you could. You could do this move. They don't have the balls to do this movie tonight. Girls are getting pie and look at this. Look at this. Look at this shit. This is crazy. You can never do this in movie today. And a regular movie, they would never allow that. Catholic high school girls in trouble and the guys banging the girl on the shower and you see her tits pressing up against the glass, like legitimately see everything. American pie was not, I mean it's not a sketch thing, but it wasn't too far different.

Speaker 2:          01:35:39       No, but even American pie. I think you'd struggle to do that now. I think the climate shifts, no, no, we're just still a part of America loves this type of humor. Joe Rogan no know that trying to, they took f1 grid girls out of Formula One racing the grid girls like hot wing. They took them out and now they're petitioning to take octagon girls out and ring card girls. They're saying like, we need to stop this like, and they're like, what are you talking about? It's how we make a living stupid. Like what? Woo Hoo. It's the objectification of women. I think if you can have chippendales and you can have, I think you should ever end card boys see who gets hired. Joey, what happened? Just cause people are crazy people, you know. Do your mind, you, you made a point the other day with those two young men that,

Speaker 1:          01:36:32       uh, I don't want to quote you. You said something about that as a, somebody got mad at people with a vagina, hats

Speaker 2:          01:36:40       black, which I was transgender charters were mad because it represents the woman's march and not everyone who was a woman has a vagina that was there. There were upset. It's transport. Holy Fuck

Speaker 1:          01:36:53       of it. As much as an American, as you will hold. I'm fucking done. I'm done. I'm done. I don't know what else to do. I mean, three months ago, uh, the fucking, some guy came out with a brilliant movie, Stephen King that scan everybody that did not, it wasn't number one film about a clown. Yeah. And all of a sudden there was a parade. You know, they got together. Clowns marched in protection of clowns because ever since that movie came out, a bunch of clowns lost that job. Oh my God. In the spring, they were booked for the fall. So they belong. You know, we'll get into something now that's just totally out of control. I read the Amy Schumer thing with the on Xeon Zari, I read, uh, you know, you try to not avoid everything, but it's right in front of you. You know, every day there's something else, you know, he just waiting for the fucking shoe to drop every day.

Speaker 1:          01:37:48       I am going to continue to be who I am, John Rowe and on stage. I don't really give a fuck sensitive. I can't. I'm a stand up. I can't, I don't have time. I think about it. I would. I also watched the podcast of you with Brendan and Brian and you talked about something that didn't happen to no, no. It did happen to me where I was at a a child children's school at a fair and a, and I tried to turn it into a bit. I just couldn't sell it to be funny. Kid was playing in front of me and I could tell there was something not right with the child. And some of the child called him a faggot and the kid's mother came out. She goes, he's not a fact that he's a transgender. And then the mother came up to me, I'm high as fuck.

Speaker 1:          01:38:36       How old were you? Two. This is three months ago. Okay, this is three months ago at a park. You know before you go to those events, you get tuned up and you put [inaudible] in your eyes and you go down and you try to be as nice as you can as a parent, but you tried to avoid talking to a lot of people. Your wife does all the talking. You just sit there and wave the people I and why? Who Do you think's in the wouldn't Machida. Yeah, Machida and you're just, you're just watching the girls. You know what I'm saying? You try to do that, but there's always something that, those events that you get back in the car with your wife and go, Mrs Rogan, what the fuck was that about? And then they'll break it down for you, Tami, I'm lying to you at every fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          01:39:16       It's like you, you were talking about the people believe in the earth that there was no Adam and eve. That's what I'm striving to. When you were telling that bit. I didn't know what the fuck he would talk about. I go, who does he hang out with? This is what's, yeah, with this poor bastard. But now that I have a child that's five, I'm getting up to see different people's views that are my age. And this lady came up to me and gave me a whole here beat how the kid is 15 they have my medication and he's known he was a woman since he was nine and that, uh, but then she fucked up Joe Rogan. She said she always wanted a girl anyway, knowing Jesus. But you guys are talking about something about there was of somebody or they've got in trouble for a three year old, give them block and see, I don't want nothing about that world.

Speaker 1:          01:40:03       I know nothing. Oh, and Benjamin, you've got in trouble. Get fired from his agency. They dropped him because he was tweeting a bunch of shit about someone using hormone blockers on a three year old. He's like, this is crazy. What I listened to that day and where I live. I thought my head was gonna blow up and her when she came over and explained why he was going to be a trend again. Well, here's the thing. Here's my thing. Here's my thing. If kids behaving a certain way, let him keep behaving that way you don't have to fucking throw hormones in the mix. You don't even know what's going to happen when you do that. You're going to change who he is. So you're telling me that he has this urge to take hormones that are not native in his body and the same amounts. He's this urge to do this, so we should just let them do it. No, he has an urge to be identified as a woman. Like you don't even have to do anything to do that. If you just decide you identify as a woman,

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       most people are going to be cool with it. Like we're saying that a child has to take some chemicals in the middle of their developmental cycle. This is the only way we can do this. This is the smart way. This is a smart way when they're six or 16 or whatever it is. That's crazy. That doesn't make sense. From a developmental standpoint, like I'm not a scientist, but I understand enough about the stages that the human being goes through before it reaches adulthood and you're not really completely formed until you're like 20 years old or 25 years old or something like that. It's like the frontal Cortex does inform to your 25 so your decision making is always a little weird. So you don't have $12 what the fuck they want to be at Fifth Katelyn? 16 six or a three though. She said that he knew it done.

Speaker 4:          01:41:36       Come on and I went home. I told my wife, my wife said, well you got to watch a show or be week. Are they eight is a show about kids that want to, you know, make the child listen. It doesn't matter. It's just that I'm trying to, I'm trying to tell you that I'm finding out about shit now though. But you know, it's weird. It's like why? Why does if someone feels a certain way, they feel they are a certain way and why did they have to take chemicals to achieve a new state? Like what? What is like the identify with being a woman so they have to take chemicals to reach this state. I think man, if I was a person who was a transgender person listened to me talk, I'd be like, shut the fuck up. You don't know shit about that. But a lot of you cheered if you're listening to this, but that all I'm saying is that this is a very unusual situation.

Speaker 4:          01:42:25       It's very unusual. I don't think it's a bad thing, but I think that doing it to someone who really can't fully make up their mind yet just seems insanely risky and what, what could happen to the kid could be terrible and people have made successful transitions when they'd transitioned in their thirties you don't have to do it when you're six if you want to be a transgender person and union thirties sure. Where your 20s or whenever we decide that a human being is rationally capable of making full life decisions that are as dramatic that that's what I thought. I was like, what the fuck makes a good decision at six days? You know, but it does matter what he want a 25 that doesn't mean that someone had 16 who thinks they're a woman. Couldn't absolutely become one later and be super, super happy with it.

Speaker 4:          01:43:12       That's not, I'm not saying that's not possible either. Like everything's possible. There's a thing for everybody and if that is what you feel like is your, your thing, you want to be that. That's just your, it's who you identify with and you, you have every right, you have every right to do that. So what you're saying, probably you know how many fucking drugs I did between 16 and 20 a lie. It's not funny. You did a lot of drugs from the time I met you. You were the fact that you had a heavier schedule before that. No, but I'm talking about like I, I tried to stay away like I was a karate guy. Like you and the kids from karate on Saturdays.

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       They were geeks. We either went to a martial art festival, we competed or we went to a karate movie or we went to a Honda martial arts supply. Hi Man. Those places. So we saved our money. Like would you want to go to the movies and see the five deadly hands? No, no. We've got to save our money. We're going to Honda next week to buy a kaboodle time. Fuck. Like we would always buy like the ones that you'd hold, uh, with the, uh, just so you know, I don't fuck around g money. What are you drawing? What are you drawing? This is what, if you look at you, you know how to write Chinese letters. Yeah. If you look at those old Chinese things, they all had this side. That's how you wrote karate. That's how you wow. Roland karate like that. So you would, I knew all about this.

Speaker 3:          01:44:47       You would buy the, the handle that I would hold the ones where you wouldn't take one dog, they had the water at the top and they had for riches of canvas. And you would stand in front of it and you mock url, Maki war and they would have like, you would get nuts guys. Really? Oh my gosh. And then we would save our money. We would geeks. That's what we did at 12 but to had a little Goombas and my neighborhood and when they were 12 they did something completely different. They went behind the school and they would row one joy and put it in a piece of glass tube and, and light it up. And we would drink a boone's farm. Oh, the fruit shit. And I'd get pukey so I didn't know who to hang out with. So I would have to be like a double a check.

Speaker 3:          01:45:30       That was a tough job for me as a 12 year old. I liked hanging out with my karate geeks. You know what I'm saying? I like going to competitions. I like doing forms. I like doing the semi contact competitions where you couldn't kick above the head. Yeah, those are good for kids, but you don't like it that way. But you still kick the kid and get disqualified. But fuck fucking. I think the joy of that, just seeing, you know, people did that. This is when life was simple for me. This was so I had to make a decision because the Kung Fu kids didn't get no pussy. They just weren't into policy. They would talk about girls and they may be had a crush on the girl and the four 30 class, but they never asked to accompany of the events. My other buddies went to pussy, so eventually I cut the karate fucking geeks out and I started hanging out with a little, the druggies and you make your transition into and from those developmental ages, like I tried to hide my drug use. I tried to hide, especially with marijuana use for two or three years. It was just marijuana. While then, once I became a freshman, got it and start basketball. My freshman year I decided to let's venture out into this acid thing. Let's venture into this masculine thing. It was a different name. It was masculine, but it really wasn't mescal and Joe Rogan. It

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       was a little tag. Cody, it would know, wasn't even pay on it. It was a little thing. I did the same shoes. Me Isn't Paoli Mba, but masculine is what they saw you in the south. They supposedly put in Tequila as something that's a sow, right? Yeah. This is something that two little fucking white kids made in a pill. It was rat poison, but something else and something else and it was very tiny. It was maybe a little size of this. That's it. And it came in aluminum foil. Even smaller than that. Wow. Even smaller than that, way smaller, that sort of thing that that's it. You paid $80 for it and you got a hundred of those and you're struggling for $3 a piece and that would fuck you up for six hours with a two hour hayes in between an hour buffer. I want to come down and I did that for three or four months.

Speaker 1:          01:47:44       Then they introduced me to thc crystal, which is snorting. They sold it as, what we do is we got a bunch of stems and seeds from the reefer. We put it in a pot and we boil that pot and whatever separate from the stems and the seeds that goes to the sides. We scraped that off. And that's where you snot in your nose. Oh my God. So I was, I was, I had like a personal karate rule cause I would always just smoke it and do the masculine, but I was never going to put nothing in my nose. Oh, you had a rule? Like a drug addict puts something in their nose. Like that's it. Like that's a complete different range. I'll never shoot heroin and I never was, especially at my karate man as a carotid man. Right. Carotid morals. I was just straight away with the reef.

Speaker 1:          01:48:34       And then I finally ended up snorting that fucking gorilla biscuits because that's what it was. It was angel dust. They just told you. And I went under the Angel Dust Tab. Like every Sunday me and my friend Carlos Perez would buy a six pack of Michelob. He only like Michelob. He has good friends tonight in this kind of special to appear with the beer will pour must say something more. Call it as long brow. Low Brow. What are we talking about? Michelob. Michelob. No we would, we would drink low brow, low brow. That one we would get a six pack on the eyebrow and fucking snot. A $10 package of the crystal and mother would go to the track on Sundays. So I knew she wouldn't come back til seven so me and him would snow in it as soon as my mother stepped foot in that car and 11 being hit with having and we'd snorting it and then fucking just sit around like and be fucking zombies all day. But that was a development and then I went after my mom got it. Just want to and acid tab fucking a year or God knows

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       what was in those goddamn things. God fucking know what's going on here. Well on rock commercial, Oh this is, oh my God, look at that guy. This is like a sketch. It's a truly great American beer. Why? Why does it have an American name motherfucker? What are you embarrassed you embarrassed to be from here? American beer. Low and proud. Fucking drink low brows. Shit. Actually it isn't American beer, right? That's like steep amy. Oh check. Keep your fucking real name. That's as American as it gets. And she's still around. Lowenbrau I don't know. But if they said low and breath, that was their name and they started the beer company and it didn't change her name. That's as American as it gets. So I'm wrong. I should shut the fuck up. It's even looking it up. It's the German brewery. Liars. Liars. Liars line about American American made.

Speaker 2:          01:50:45       Apparently they make a lot of American American plants make a lot of cars now that you think are Japanese cars like Toyota Tundras. They make them in Texas can make a bunch of them in Ohio too. Honda's Nissan's. That's weird, right? Like if you think you'd buy in a Honda, you sink. You're definitely buying a Japanese car. If you think you're buying some American cars, it might be a Mexican car. How crazy is that? Like what companies making their cars down in Mexico? I think they, I think they closed a couple of plants. I think Toyota was down there. Somebody else for a while. But here's the thing, if they put him down in Mexico, but they gave him American money, like the levels of American money that's in Mexico, they would stop doing it a lot actually. Wow. Look at all these different ones.

Speaker 2:          01:51:30       Chrysler has three plants, four to three plans. GM is four plans. Moms does one, they do it down there cause it's cheaper, which I guess they have to do what they gotta do and I'm sure it helps the community because then I know it does. I know people that have had manufacturing down in these countries and they do it for the cheap, but it does help the people. Like there's some places that don't have much, but what's arguable is like why is living like a western person so important when these people have been living in their own way for thousands of years. It's just they just didn't have like all the crazy infrastructure and all the shit that we had. They didn't have the crazy cities. And you know other than a few cities in Mexico like Mexico City. So they would go and put these plants and like why is it doing, I mean I don't, I'm all for people being able to work. But is that better? Is it better than the way they were living before when they were living like indigenous people are living like villagers are living like trades people or whatever they did to get by. I Dunno. Maybe it is better. Maybe it's, let's go back to the whole situation here. I still remember, cause I'm a little older than us storm, remember where it was kind of starting to get that bull if you bought a foreign car like I, I'm bad old ways. I'm not sure that that, I still remember the La

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       mid seventies I still remember when Toyota advertised or Nissan advertised the car for 1995 and I would go, wait a second, I got $40 in the bank. I could buy one of those. It was $1,900 stupid like a corolla or something. And I still remember there was a time in this country when if you bought of what if you were on the first person on this block. If you showed up with a foreign car, you got a little bit of grief, you got a little bit of grief, and then it felt like they sold themselves. It felt like we dropped the ball at some point. As Americans, as you know, I don't know what happened to Detroit and all that stuff. I know that where's the highest populations of Puerto Rico in this country? I don't know. You think it's the bronx, but it's not. It's a suburb outside of Cleveland.

Speaker 1:          01:53:38       Why? Because in the 50s they took a bunch of Puerto Ricans and put them into this suburb to work at the car plants. All the car plants shut down at that. We ended up going other places and whatever and blah, blah, blah and blah, blah, blah, and then the foreign car and started checking our fucking ass. Why again? I don't know. What's it? The workmanship? Was it the quality? All I know is if, if I got a fucking Toyota, I could drive it for 80,000 miles without stopping to get gas. You know what I'm saying? You as a consumer and as an American, you want to buy American products and you want to buy American made products, you know? So there's a couple of places now like beside Mexico, there's, where are we? We have places now, like in Indiana we had like, Toyota has a couple of places and they should bring it back. I mean, Eh, fuck it. Let some, you know, so we trade, we get someone to tell you all of this stuff, which is a, what kind of car are they? Japanese or Chinese or Japanese? Japanese and let some of our strict get made over there as part of, is it Nafta?

Speaker 4:          01:54:48       Um, that's North American, North American free trade agreement. So that's just, I think, I think I'm just talking about my answer, but I think that's just us. Mexico and Canada. So when we build a car in Mexico, it's a lot cheaper. Develop that car because of the rate. Yeah, they pay, people pay feel blessed. It's cheaper to get land. These people don't have anything else going on down there or not as much going on down there. Obviously as they do in America and some like heavily populated cities and so they can offer people much less money and they do it. There's a lot of plants that do that, but here's the thing, it's the real question is do you think that this is just going to elevate these people and they're eventually going to catch up with the Western world and live the way that we're living right now in the United States?

Speaker 4:          01:55:29       Like there's ultimately a possibility of that or are we saying, well, we're always going to have these people that would treat less good and we're just always going to keep them in that position. They're never going to get any better. I mean, what? Which one is it? It's either one of those two things or I made it possibly be that people just want shit cheaper, so bad. They don't care. They don't care. They don't care if a guy's making a dollar a week or whatever the fuck they make. How much do they make? If you had to guess, if you guess, how much does someone in a um, uh, an automobile plant in Mexico make as opposed to an American worker? I'm sure someone must have done some sort of a study.

Speaker 4:          01:56:06       It's weird, man, because if they were doing the exact same thing on this patch of dirt, we would go, what? You can't pay that little? Then you say, oh, but down there, everything's cheaper. And the given these people an opportunity like why is it better? Here's the question. Why is it better than the way they've always been living in Mexico? $2 per hour workers make $40,000 suv is $2 an hour. Jesus Christ to imagine a person working all day and you hand them $16 you sir are a piece of shit. Could you imagine guy busts his ass on an assembly line all day? You give him $16 fuck you. That's crazy. Started a dollar 10 an hour. Oh my God. A dollar an hour. You make more than prison. That is ridiculous. And that's Mexican money. That's American money. A dollar a day, $2 and hour. Maybe it's like the translated joe would go, fuck, that's insane.

Speaker 4:          01:57:06       But it's, it's just the idea is that if you're always going to be able to, you got to always be able to make more money. Like these people have this idea in, a lot of these corporations have unlimited growth. They just want to constantly be growing and growing and growing. It's some people think it's a very dangerous idea because if you're your bottom line for your companies to always outdo every quarter at a certain time, people start getting desperate and they start cutting environmental corners or cut and research corners. They're doing whatever the fuck they have to do to keep their bottom line down and keep their profits coming in. And that's what you could say about like these prescription drug companies, people want to think that these companies are evil. They're companies. Their job is to make money, okay? And they're caught up in a storm where they're allowed to make legal money and this legal money is fucking substantial.

Speaker 4:          01:57:56       It's a giant amount of money these pharmaceutical companies are making on an opiate, so people are dying left and right. Joey left and right. This is one of the craziest, unspoken Emmett epidemics. The human race to a little bit forever. You the truth of everything. I still talked to my truck. It was good to me when I needed them. And from month to month I still taught for the Armenian. I still talk to Don sleazy and in fact the hustle. He's, he just did a big movie. You got a couple of lines of big movie. That's awesome. They do what they do. I do what I do. I have a family. I got a call from the guy made him, I saw him at rouse. You have bet you did. Do you see do about the Armenian? This is one of my favorite bits. All of the army that routes.

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       He gave me a hug and all with his kids and kids. Are you right now? You'll know how many times I met him with his kids and he would put an eight ball in my head. You know, I've been in that position now. I had groceries and I hugged him and he goes, you mind if I call you later? You know, and I go, she'll call me whatever you want. And he goes, uh, do you, where do you live? And I told him, and he goes, I live here. Can I meet you? I went to ask you a question. I didn't know. I thought he was going to ask me if I still did blow. I didn't know. I, you know, I'm, I'm good, I'm good. And when I met the men meet him, what he wanted to know was, he goes, you're a comedian.

Speaker 1:          01:59:19       And uh, I just wanted to ask if you knew anybody who, Eh, get pills. And I go, I got a Xanax at the house and you're free to take them. He goes, no, no, no, no. I talking pain. I see. Or whatever. Again, like shook his hand. I gave him a hug. Joe Rogan, I don't know nobody, I don't know. A week later I told him I'd to ask, cause I do know a guy kind of saw the white dude in Hollywood and I called him like I was a week later they are meeting and called me and he goes and I go, you know what? I'm sorry, hold on. And I went, I looked when I called this white dude and he called me back and he said, ah, give me a couple of days, you know? And he called me back and what he told me was mind boggling what he's done, the prices.

Speaker 1:          02:00:10       I went just getting what you pay for pharmaceutical. He hit me back and he told me three numbers on the phone with three different names of what this guy had. And I'm not a drug dealer. I called the Armenian and I just said, listen, this is what they told me and this is what he wants. And the guy goes, okay, don't tell him in a week I get a thousand. Um, I could not believe the amount of money for these pills. Rarely, you know, I never was a big pill head, but oh my God, the black market for pills is fucking ginormous. And I knew this kid and Hollywood will come through, I know him

Speaker 2:          02:00:53       15 years, he's a big Jujitsu guy door and they can't close it. It is mind boggling what you pay for pills. Well, you know what happened, right? You know what? We've got it all started. Well, this is what happened. First of all, they're obviously very addictive. Um, second of all, something happened in Florida where they allowed people to get the all clinic prescription pain clinics everywhere. It was basically what offtrack betting is for gambling. That was heroin, heroin, 60 minutes show me, everybody's got an ache. You know, sometimes my fucking neck bothers me after a couple of podcasts, I need to get a little oxy, my back, just I can't sleep. Here you go. Have some oxy. They would have a pharmacy attached to a doctor's office town of 3,200 was flooded with neuro 21 million pain pills as addiction crisis worsen. Lawmakers say, whoa. A town of 3,200 people was flooded with 21 million pain pills town in West Virginia.

Speaker 2:          02:01:52       Jesus Christ. People in, in those towns like from the wild and wonderful west of West Virginia. What does that, the whites of West Virginia remember that well, wonderful. Well what kind of wild and wonderful whites of West Virginia oxies, Xanax, nick, whatever the fuck you got. The little ones. I got the little ones for anxiety. You know, you take an anxiety. I get them lately before I get, like if I haven't gone in the road for a while. Oh really? That Thursday morning. Oh my God. Joe Rogan. As I'm getting ready, I keep thinking like I'm fucking not packing. Right. I forgot something. I forgot the holes of sleep apnea and I've been buying half of it. And you know what? I even fall asleep. I got out of the plane and I fall asleep. But on the road people give me weird, creepy things and it's so blackberry is so that I just go to Web Deb d and You looked for a pill indicator and if there's something good, I'll save it.

Speaker 2:          02:02:49       Cause at least I got to live. If I ever have an emergency, if I'm lonely with or something, you're capo, these little pills, you know? Wow. But when the dog, when they told me that, like I knew when I was a kid, I would go to central, uh, to Washington square park and I could get eight, 10 milligram Vallian with the V in the middle. That's the real deal. When you're going to fuck, and they got a v in the middle of cut out all the shit. That's the shit of Mac daddies. I could get eight of those for $10 and that would, here's the question. Do you think if it was legal, more or less people to use it or the same? Why are you, what is this trick points? Thursday? I'm curious what you gambling and drugs. Pills you give people the green greenlight dog.

Speaker 2:          02:03:43       We're fucking, we're crap creatures of habit. We're all going to fucking go. Some of us are going to control it. Listen to some people that get knee surgery and neck surgery like yourself and you thrown away the Vicodin and there's other people that take that prescription and two years later they're shooting heroin. Yeah, I don't understand that. Okay. I have different holes in our jeans, Bro. Well, there's some people that like pain. I'm not one of them, but there's some people that genuinely like it. They get pleasure out of it. What kind of pain do you like? I mean, what kind of pain? I don't think this is what I'm saying. This is the question. I think they think there are syndromes where, and it's probably fairly common, it turns, it's not just one person. It's like several people that could point out that uh, experienced actual like pleasure, like a serotonin burst from certain amounts of pain. They don't feel, I don't think they feel it is the way we feel it. And so they're always trying to do

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       things to themselves and they say that some of the people that get like a lot of piercings have that, uh, some people that get a lot of tattoos have that. They start to feel the want to feel it more. They want to burn it into themselves. It's an I. Dot. I'm not, obviously not a psychologist, but it's apparently a pretty common theory. Another day I want to talk to you about, I was the pub cash can believe. I have to say I'm not a psychiatry. I love to podcast where you were talking about cause I want to do, to really tell you the truth. The podcast are, you were talking about, that may be some, the Jones John Jones actions were caused by head injuries. Could easily been. I tell you not caused by, not caused by cause he usually could be a fact. I got to tell you something.

Speaker 3:          02:05:17       Joe Rogan, uh, again. Well, let's go back to abuse from gambling or pills. The mind with cocaine is a very tricky mine. Oh yeah. And it takes a year off. I'm just telling you this from experience because I learned a lot about new tropics from you. I don't really know much about it, but Roman [inaudible] sent me two of his jugs. It's the ship that neuro one, the orange juice. But that's not shit that got me into nootropics when I got off cocaine that came in the mail and I really drank and I didn't tell nobody my secret because I knew, especially for a guy like me, you know, John Jones is 26 years old. He's a phenomenal fighter. I didn't think that it really had anything to do with any other thing. I think it was that when you were on cocaine and that year afterward, cocaine, thanks to pleasure patterns out of your mind.

Speaker 3:          02:06:08       I'll be your brain. It's not the same or tone and the Melatonin. I don't know. Don't correct me on this, but I feel that it took me a year to 18 months for me to just become a human again and I haven't gotten hit in the head. Not since I was about 13 I got beat up by the guy. I tried the Mug and I got hit in the head with a flashlight. It really took me 18 months to embrace your man. Yeah. Again. Yeah. I want you to remember that. I want you to think of that morning, what happened in Santa Fe with when he ran the light and he ran away from that. What? What? What was he, Jamie, do you think he just woke up and was going to church? No, he was out the night before. Yeah. He could have very well been out from the night.

Speaker 3:          02:06:54       There's no pleasure. You know, you take, it takes your mind a long time. You know what's the thing? When I get off the juice, I got to do something for my boss to grow again. You'd have to take something called clomiphene. Okay, and what? Well, there's a couple of different ones. Apparently a, it's an estrogen blocker. It blocks your estrogen. That's actually one of the things that John tested positive. So how long would it take for me to get my balls back again? It'd take you a little while. Hey Ben, he stayed here the amount of time that you were doing it. Oh, see if that's why you're only supposed to go on like a short cycle unless you're a crazy bodybuilder guy. Those guys just stay on it all the time. Thing with the cocaine, Bro. I thought about your statement and I went home and started writing and thinking

Speaker 2:          02:07:37       I got off November, 2007 it took me a year and a half just to become a human being to realize I was fat. I was 400 pounds. I need it to go to weight watchers. Took me 18 months to realize I hadn't married. My wife took me a long time for my brain to think normal. Like anybody else does. Right. So I want you to take that into consideration. Or deb. I definitely do. I know you're saying, I agree to me a long time. You know when you do blow, when you go on stage to say, if I do blow three nights in a week and I go on stage, I have no control. Joe Rogan, I'm looking at you in the face. You see me on stage. I have no control. I have no connection from my brain to what's coming out of my mouth. I can't. Now you're going, do you, are you speaking to rats now?

Speaker 2:          02:08:28       Uh, it was empty words. There was no passion behind that. That's why it wasn't funny. You know, you said to me, you said it blocks love. It blocks the love. That's it. The love in between my, the cocaine in my words is gone. But that's what stimulus do. Stimulants or ramp up the aggression and the impulsiveness and they ramp up your fearlessness. They ramp up your courage and get disproportionate. They ramp up your ego like some stimulants on some people. Some people obviously look to people that can handle booze and these people that can't amble even a little booze. And I think that's the same with stimulants. I think that's the same with pretty much everything, every almost every life experience. In fact, I think there's some people that can handle things and some people that can't and some people that can't at first, then they eventually learn to.

Speaker 2:          02:09:15       Um, someone sent me something about Rodney Dangerfield was fucking great man. All from New York Times, the relentless thing. Yeah, it was great. John. John Dudley sent it to me. Fucking a, it was amazing. Yeah, I read that. It's amazing. It's amazing. Oh No. Tait Fletcher. Tait Fletcher. San Antonio's great. It was tate. Shout out to take flincher where tate a jam letter of recommendation. Rodney dangerfield. It is an amazing piece. Who wrote this? What does the name of the gentleman, Alex, how stat Alex, you made a masterpiece. That's a fucking hell of an article about one of the greatest of all time when it comes to standup comedy. And he just talks about the evolution of Rodney dangerfield and how like it wasn't until he was like in his fifties and he really fucking got it together like and became the great standup that we know him as and his process for boiling down as material. Joey, it's a fucking amazing article. I read it two times, so I look, I get tism. What do you want to do? We to do this special? Yes. We're going to do a special, I'm going to direct your comedy special. We're just going to figure out when to do it and where to do it. In June at the Ice House. The Ice House is the place I think. Yeah. Let's do six shows. Let's do six. Let's do, let's do I want to do to Thursday to Friday to Saturday. Boom. I want to get those

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       crazy week. Savages is a different kind of animal that goes out on Thursday night. One hour there. They're a little more ramped up for one hour, 15 minutes. You Go, you're going to go crazies. We're going to do, I would just want it. We're going to capture the real Joey Diaz experience and we're going to put together a special, that's it. We're done June in a ice house. We'll give everybody a the details, but this is the first special that I've ever even attempted to do something with other than my own. So listen, you would be the guy that they would do with fucking crazy. Yeah. I think I picked the name of it is a immigrant because the towel, the immigrant mentality is proof with respect to pay me. That's perfect. That's a perfect name and the perfect fucking name of the album. Okay, beautiful. I'm already in process to write and I'm ready to go. I think the ice house is the place we'd been there a million times. It's home. It's family. Oh my God. It's all, yeah, it's a great place to film and when that place gets Rockin Holy Shit. It's going to Colorado.

Speaker 1:          02:11:34       I'm going to Colorado. I'm flying in a day early. I'm interviewing Antonio La Dzio. I'm going to go show people were kidnapped. Bella doesn't show pupil the halfway house. I'm going to walk around Bova I book tape all that and I'm going to have that up this fucking spring. I got some shit. I'm planning. I want to do like a little mixed tape type of stand up drop. We got to let these mother fuckers. Yeah, I'm ready to shoot the special. They don't had a great time in Charlotte, man. I knew you weren't Durham and you and I would discuss in the comedy scene in North Carolina. Amazing how it was judged. I just want to thank new people and the week before that I was in Austin and that place is like this last time I got emotional and Austin like I don't know how many times I drove from Houston to Austin to do the open Mike on Wednesday, Joe Rogan and that little stage, I can tell you looking at your face five times and now I was headlining and selling the place.

Speaker 1:          02:12:30       I just didn't walk in that dog. I did the open mic for Margie and she would tell me, you're too dirty for me. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I'll be at the Austin is fucking, it's really weird to see the growth of cities, but not only that, to see the growth of comedy in these cities, Portland, Oregon, like that's what happened. That's how fidelity took over Cuba. Just little growth in different areas and internet that has made people more aware of comedy. 15 years ago we would go to Houston and be excited. We would go to New York and maybe like three other places. Everything else was just a regular town down. And Freetown is excited about your rogue and Bert Kreischer fucking, uh, the garage. It's a Chinese girl. Uh, Amy Wong, Allie Allie won. There's a lot of grace. I'm fucking excited about people coming town.

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       You know, it's uh, we've seen this growth. Like it's been an amazing, like, see, I got into comedy, I'm the tail. And like when I got into comedy, people were telling you to Tobar kid because five years before that ever seen is we're getting 1500 plus add and features again, 2500% and have the line is we're getting five grandpas and all of a sudden what I got it, I still remember the first notes he gave us was before you guys get into comedy, I went in to tell you what happened to the bubble busted and he broke down what comics are getting paid. I didn't give a fuck. He was just trying to discourage us. Yeah, he's wrong. He's wrong. You know what the Bible is not writing jokes. Yeah. That was the Bible does the Bible in Boston. I'm, I'm almost positive. I don't know what people blame it on the access of comedy on television at the time.

Speaker 2:          02:14:24       I believe that cause the great ones are still there. I think what happened was there was a lot of guys that were really, really, really, really fucking funny cause they had taken their act and Polish that motherfucker like a diamond and they, they brought it to you and it was just perfect. It was a perfect act, but it didn't change. It was a perfect piece of work. But they didn't write more. Some guys did, but not enough guys dead. And so people would keep coming back to the shows. They'd be able to say the jokes word for word year after year. Like they'd go to see some guys, they would do the same act year after year and they never left Boston. And it's a very unfortunate thing because like when it comes to like proficiency level, there's guys like Steve Sweeney that used to kill in a way that you're like, oh my God, what's the guy that used to drink the white Russians and a container?

Speaker 2:          02:15:08       Don motherfucking Gavin. Gavin is one of the stuff for guys out in Boston. When I started that you heard about your boy too at the Tony Clark packing some heat. Let him when he was killing it. And what's the guy that had the shows? He was funny. In 91, Bro, Anthony Clark married to Anthony Clark was fucking throwing, he's a merge that murder. He used to fill the uh, faneuil hall club with all screaming checks. I never saw anything like it cause he was cute, you know, and he would, he would be silly on stage. Carl's loved him. I mean to the point where that place, would it be overrun with girls? It would be like 80, 20 girls in this faneuil hall common connection. We'd be like, what the fuck? Like what are their comic brings in girls like this, that love him. And then he's another one, they'd see the same bits over and over and over again.

Speaker 2:          02:15:53       They didn't care. They would find with it. It's weird. It was a weird time. What fucked everybody up was people would go to see someone special, like Kennison did a special and then he tried to do the material from the special on a show and the people already knew the material and they were like yelling out bits and fucking up beds. And so I think comics then started realizing once you do like a real special and put it on hbo or something like that and it makes you famous, you got to throw that shit away and write a completely new set. That's why it's so tough now Tara, because you're trying to develop your hour on the road and you put your wire the road and you go off and follow a week to promote that hour and you got the same half you got half hour or that hour unless you're fucking Harry Houdini.

Speaker 2:          02:16:40       Well now prepare for that already. When I went through after the last time was a big fucking lesson. Everybody has that lesson that's going through that right now. I'm just putting this out. That's it. Yeah. Yeah, and those weeks when you're putting that out, just stay home. Yeah, just stay at home. Don't embarrass you. Don't try to do some stay home and get 15 minute bits of the show and once you get six of those 15 minute bits, then you go out and put 45 together. You start from scratch and then what? You still got 30 35 minutes. Once you shut your bed, once you shut that 50 minutes, you still have 35 minutes to work on it again. There's no shame. Fucking your boy is an Adam. We stays home for a fucking year to work on an hour and then goes out. Russell, Russell Peters.

Speaker 2:          02:17:25       Yeah, he stays home for a long time. He still does some gigs in the road. Be MCS and just talks to the crowd Fox with them, Bro. Shout out to our little pep part and a Friday night. Sound out the stamp of only the second comic to do it. Who sold out the staples? Gabriel, did he really? Jesus Christ, Friday, Friday till they get game. That's a Laker game. Gabriel Iglesias, hold out a Laker game Friday night at the staples center. Him and Kevin Hart are the only ones to do it. An animal and a sock to yourselves. Murder in it. Here's why he's funny. Anybody can go see him. You can take your kids to see him, your mom to see him. He's a nice guy. Everybody loves him. You're getting what you want to see. You getting a funny comedian having a good time. That sounds fucking thousands.

Speaker 2:          02:18:13       I want to say that's at least like 18,000 people. I think that might be 25 it might be 20,000 I think that places dog. Here's the beautiful thing. I still remember him paying me $35 or the ones and I think I'll do the bicycle club and he would host. Wow. How many people? 21,000 Jesus Christ. Oh my God. That's so many people might have 21,000 people. Powerful. Gabriel Iglesias. Holy Shit. That's nuts guy. This fucking, there's, there's so many. I'd of comedy. He's right at the top right now. Him and Kevin Hart and t in terms of like being able to do that, especially being able to do that in la. He's a hero in La. He's done more shows consecutively at the Ice House and sold out like fucking 10 years ago. He was doing that. He would do like Monday shows, Tuesday shows two shows, Wednesday two shows three if it's just fucking crank them out, man. He was taking people out to breakfast after it shows. Yeah, I'm Christmas Eve after that, he still got, he still does two shows on Christmas Eve. That's amazing. He could do shows at three in the afternoon. He would do shows to the ice house like whenever he wanted and every path hit three in the afternoon fucking pack. Let's God woo people wanted to see it. Have a couple of drinks, watch funny comedy. Why

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       not tie cut? Just just the amount of people that are going out the comedy. I'm just honored to be a positive thing. You Know Joey, you and I have known each other for a long time now and so we've seen like a couple of waves. Oh my God, no, no, nothing like nothing like this. The fuck where you at? The wiltern sold out and who he is and Chappelle and John. John Mayer at the fucking forum. They were sold out too. He was sold out, but he did a warm up the night before somewhere else like yeah, let's just try it out just to see if it works. And that sold out too, like people are out and about Jack. Yeah. People are out and about. Well, we're, we're very, very lucky to have dave out there right now, like, like doing a lot of comedy. Like he's the top of the food chain and he's doing a lot of comedy.

Speaker 3:          02:20:16       Did two specialists last year in two specials this year and they're fucking good man. One, he did it from DC. That is a really good special, gosh, that's a whole, I enjoyed the shit. I enjoyed the belly room too, but yeah, I love how I have, I haven't seen that one. How bout for every age? Told you the belly room wouldn't work. You'd go, fuck. They're selling belly room when you get into a groove and the belly room. Okay, let me break something down here at the comedy store and again, you're going to go, we heard this guy's, no, you haven't heard this whim because I just found this one out fucking three weeks ago when you got sick that night and you couldn't, I covered for you and the belly room. You had the flu and they called me. That went through the belly flew and he flew though I heard through the belly room and I have this shirt analogy gone at the belly room and it just wasn't doing it.

Speaker 3:          02:21:10       The belly room does it where it is. Why at the belly room does it require the efficiency that the original room required? How so? So you'd be, you want to slow it down a little bit and the belly rooms out. You're saying, okay, so I'm sparring with you and we're not doing 50% we're doing 30 now, right in the belly room. If we do 50 it's a little too aggressive. That two right there, the energy's right there, and I learned this after 20 fucking years of doing spots that right. Remember the belly room was where I learned the story though. Before that I was rushing to the punchline and not getting into a joke out the belly room was where I learned to sit back a little bit and explain what the fuck you, what it is you're trying to tell us why you just kept telling me, what did you just say?

Speaker 3:          02:22:08       There's no segue here. There's nothing to joey. You're just eating some girl's asshole is great and we don't want to hear that. We want to hear how you got that. I learned that in 99 and the belly room fucking around and I went back up there a couple of weeks ago for me, the main room, I got to come out like a fuck in the main room. I got to come out like Mike Tyson when he beat up. Uh, what? What did he beat up in Atlantic city and knocked him out in the 57 seconds. Who? He was part of one of the brothers with the mouthpiece. Leon spinks. Michael spinks. I eat dick in the main room. I last, I come out jasmine crossing one to a different room. I got to come out one, two in the main room and the original room, the gauges. Who you're following.

Speaker 3:          02:22:57       I gotta follow crystal lip with a, I got who came out this year, who came out of that and travis with a flying sidekick riddled fabricio version. You got to come out with the flying side kick at the original room. Okay. There's some people break it down for you. The original room, you got to follow Joe Rogan, Chris, Leah or bill burl like I had a couple of weeks ago. I got to come out from the curtain. Okay. Until a flying side kick upward. It's just hasn't been done since Bruce Lee and the Chinese connection. There's no, it's me. And you would usually do a flying sidekick from an evil ground. No, I got to go upward. That's their comedy and the fucking original rule. That's where you see me go bananas where you've seen me at my best, like crazy red in the face about to have a heart attack. Pitching your heart out on stage.

Speaker 3:          02:23:48       You have to come out with a flying site. That's a crazy move you, but you go on a vertical or a tremendous up. You're on your back kick and y'all got to get out my shoulders and kick up and tried to get you in the drawer. That's the original room. The belly room, like the rest on my right hook. I could rest on my one toe. The belly room. You can, I could breathe and just throw one twos and keep you off me deep breathe deep. Kept my composure and even though you hit me with some of those zoom guy, oh slugs, I got him whom? God, no. If I keep my hands up and stay away from you're right, I'll be okay. That's the belly room. That's why the belly room I always thought would be a great place to shoot us. You know what's great about the belly rooms?

Speaker 3:          02:24:32       The same thing that's great about the White House. The Ice House Annex. The second room. Yes. That's like there's no room for an act. There's no room for an ax. It's too intimate. Like you have to figure out where's the no fat aspect of the bet and you got to be tuned into the bet they feel. With my 55th birthday up there, I put the Ice House. What days at, it's a Saturday. The 19th so 19th I can't get the comedy store, so I got the original room. I got the a small room at the ice house on the 17th and 19th and then the 18th I've got the original room. I got the belly room at the comedy store and it's the night before George Washington's birthday. So I got people doing that one too. So I turned 55 that weekend. Oh Shit. And working out with Uncle Joey, I only tried to 10 or 15 bucks.

Speaker 3:          02:25:21       I do that once a month and I go on that stage too. And you just fuck around you just reading. I write down in a notebook that I don't really know about and we develop it together up there and sometimes it's phenomenal. Nine at that time, it really is phenomenal. It's a good idea. What would they tell you? Why? Because I met 30% I purposely the mandible, this is purposely, I wouldn't do that. The comedy store on a Saturday night? No, no. I purposely did that ability to take the edge off. Okay. I might even have a shot of alcohol. Whoa, whoa. Just one. It's three point. Yeah. Cause, oh, I don't eat much alcohol. So I'll do it edible and have a little shot of alcohol at the Ice House and tape it and always get one or two great things. Joe Rogan, I'm not going to tell you I got an hour of greatness, but because you're so relaxed and they know what they're getting, it's a big difference job.

Speaker 3:          02:26:17       The comedy store. Listen, how do you sharpen metal with metal comedy store stones? You do? Uh, we do. Uh, we do a special on June. May I got to go to the comedy store three nights, four nights a week. That me, that's it. That's the gym. And throw it low that, that the WHO's next? None of no it. Delete it. Get up there. Take, I do take downs for an hour. Take them down. I don't care how bow, that's what you do before you shoot a thinking. You need all of it. Right. You need to sense, you need the writing. You need to set all of it. You need to riding. You need to working out. Your head's gotta be at the right place. Absolutely. You know what else? I think you need, do you need friendship? I think that helps. I think that would, I think that when you set up to me on the phone the other day and you also know that you got, when I get there, you got to leave some stuff to aggravate me.

Speaker 3:          02:27:06       But I've thought about this many times like who would I be without you guys? Like who would I be without you? Who would I be without Eddie? Who would that be without red band? Who would that be without Ari? Who would that be with that Dunkin? I think about the same. The Thompson girls think about the same thing. Who would I be? These are these people like Bert. They mean a lot to me. Like they're, they're very important people. And then there's your family, which is through the moon. That's that. That kind of love is very weird. That that kind of love is over. Whelming how, how much it changes who you are. You have, you were talking about the tower g come doe the Bruce Lee Book and you were saying that, you know, a lot of excerpts were stolen and the, I don't even know, we're not even, and that's not the proper word that I used.

Speaker 3:          02:27:47       Play drives. I have a tie with Joey Diaz and half of that tile is what I learned from Joe Rogan. The other half of that ty was what I learned from my Ra and working with Dunkin. None of us are very original. I just kicked it up a bit. Uh, one thing I love about you is you didn't sell teachers that happened to show you don't need to do nothing. When I go into a town, I focused on five shows. I don't want to do your podcast. I don't want to go see the statue of Liberty. I really don't. You're right. He did a kick ass. I'm there to go to get them a good meal. Uh, after the first show. Look, it's a small club. It's sold that let me not go out and take pictures. Let me focus on the important thing, which I'm 55 I got to give you 150 fucking percent and those are the towel.

Speaker 3:          02:28:35       You know, I'm up early. I do my radio, I'm up early to get out of there. Every once in a while on Saturday you got to have, you've got to have a drink with the audience, a little charlotte on stage or whatever. You know what I've, I've come to think of myself as one piece of, I'm a piece of three or four. You guys, if you want the truth, are we, I like Ari's relaxation on stage already takes chances. Like we all want, all three of us love to take chances. That's why we do what we do. You're not gonna get the same hour, year out the fucking, he had not even close. We also have a similar style of mixing everything up. Yeah, I have. Everybody has their own towel, man. You know Bruce Lee just, he just wanted to teach you how to combine it and that's what we're doing right now.

Speaker 3:          02:29:27       For sure. You'd think I'm johnny original. I'd take a little bit. I learned from Bert. I learned from Tom, I learned from Bill Burr, I learned from Dave Chapelle and now this is your art again, there's every, the arm bar is the same whether I go to you or John Jockey and showing me the same thing, but it's how I do it. Yup. Yup. It's the same point. It's a really good point. I think there's no way you could ever say any one person is not influenced because every single style of standup comedy is in some way or another or originated was like the Lenny Bruce's and you know the, the Dick Gregory's and the, you know the guys who were doing it. Wait, the danger fields guys doing it way back in the day and even Bob Hope, all those guys, they started this thing. You got to think the world has had no standup comedy up until like what a hundred and fucking 50 years ago or something.

Speaker 3:          02:30:21       That's nothing. This shit just started and the owner was one of the first guys to do it. Mark motherfucking twain. Mark motherfucking twain would do readings of his book and it was funny and people would laugh. He was in front of people rocking. He was killing. He's telling stories and reading and people thought he was hilarious. He would give speeches. They found somebody before Mark Twain, I'm sure, but he was really popular writer years ago. Yet they is living proof that that standards existed before him. Uh, uh, uh, a form of this art form existed before. Yeah. It's sub civilization. I did read that a couple of years, I'm sure. Subdued. Yes. There was some store and because, and now I see myself on stage. It's like when I take my sets now pro, I hear, I hear a little Joe Rogan. I hear a little arriving. I hear a little lenny bruce. I love when

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       he bruises. Yeah, man, man. Dig. That's, I love that Levy. Bruce said Shit that you didn't know. People said, fuck. Yeah. And it wasn't dirty. Not just a certain word. Like when I go on stage that, you know, uh, you want, you don't want to know my leukemia and the place, my Luchia is those mergers. Like, what's he, what's he saying? Right, right, right. My Luke, it's just bad luck, but that's something Lenny Clarke with say the fuck were you? He put them a luke on me. You know what I'm saying? We were all, we're not plagiarizing or doing anything like that. No, we're influenced. We're influenced and muscle wrong with that. One thing that's important is, uh, we're all real fans of comedy. I know. You're still a fan. You still enjoy watching common hell of it. I go to the fourth wall a lot. Chair, rugged.

Speaker 1:          02:32:08       The fourth wall was with Mickey told rocky to do dog. I gotta you don't mean I got to take him out of the rock. Nikki told rocky do. Why? Because, because he wanted he, somebody took all, no, I'm sorry. Apollo took rocky. Oh, dirty gym. Some look at that. Look at these motherfucker taking it back. No, no, no, no, no. He took him to his own black gym and he goes, I wanted you to look at these guys so you can look at their eyes. And he goes, remember when your eyes used to be like that? Ooh, that's right. He goes, remember when your eyes used to be like that rock? So lately I've been going before I go out and then they go to the fourth wall and North Hollywood and I pay $5 to do five minutes. And the rule is you have to sit there, you know, most open Mike should do your state's time and you leave.

Speaker 1:          02:32:57       You have to sit down and watch others. Why did I tell you something? The last six weeks I've learned more from watching these open Mike, hers than anything because I also realized that where I was when I was one of these guys, I wanted what I had. Right now I want it to be a headline. I wanted to not be a rich guy, but I wanted to just be funny. I want it to be accepted as a comedian and ever since I've been going to the fourth wall, I go there three or four nights a week. Joe Rogan, I pay $5 to do five minutes. I'm no better than anybody else, but the main thing is he asked me what I want to go up and I always tell him towards the end because I want to watch these kids and joy. Every time I leave that Bri leave laughing and I fucking learned something and I'm back. No alcohol and that Joe Rogan. Hmm. Just fucking eight people watching you do five minutes. I want you to think about when you were doing five minutes and what was going through your head. I'm just telling you my heart's beating because I stood. I remember bombing and leaving there thinking, Nah, I'm going to have to get a little way the job or now you're going to have to get a cook job. These guys all have day jobs. They all talked about this jobs,

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       but every time I go to the fourth ward, Bro, I fucking learned something. I go there some nights I go to flappers, I go there some nights I go to the store, I go there some nights I go to the how I do it that way, but I always go there and every time I go there I always go there with like five minutes planned pro. It doesn't even hit the stage because from watching those guys I learned something and I remember something and I just come up with this crazy story so I look at it as like a like doing kettlebells. Yeah, that's a good way to look at it. I really do. I look at these young guys and I remember that pain and that confusion that I had that fucking feeling you had when you were an open mike or in your friends are telling me you were funny, but you still had to drive the limo, keep the paper job route or still drop off papers or whatever the fuck job you said you had.

Speaker 3:          02:35:12       You told me the story about meeting at he Atlantic's and all that. You're still in that crossroads of comedy where you don't know what to do, but you know in your fucking hard that you just can't wait to be a headliner if somebody would just give you a chance. Back then, I wasn't even thinking I can never be a headliner. I was really just hoping I could make a living. I never thought I'd wind up being, when you mean living, you mean food? A one bedroom cable TV. There was a guy that had a fucking loft. He was the king. I had a loft it, they'd taken a school house and turned it into condominiums. This guy, I never, I'll never forget. I looked up to him like I couldn't believe where he was living in Dj Hazard. That's his name. Hilarious comedian. Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          02:35:56       He Damn. Sure. Well Dj has always been a real nice guy and an excellent guy. Very funny, very funny guy. Always has been, but I remember he had like a loft apartment. I remember everybody talked about it. It's like what? This got brick walls inside. He was like, he was the king. He was living like an adult. But he was, he was a standup comedian. Like everybody else. We had thought about like, you know, you're living like you're barely getting by stuffing a bunch of guys and do a house. You know, there was a lot of like comedy flop houses or comedians would wind up moving in together or you're living in some shitty apartment and he could barely afford. Are you living with your girlfriend or something? It's weird when you go back and think about it, you know?

Speaker 6:          02:36:35       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:36:36       Like you coulda quit at any time. Think about it. Think about it your early days when it's terrible and it just bombed all the time and you're like, it really? Yeah. I watched some do with set one night at the old triple and in front of 8 million people and he and his mind, he was at the garden though. Wow. It's like I get it now, but where's your meat to Pitt? I left it at home. You know who, uh, one of the most proud moments as a young comedian when, uh, I was at the comedy store and um, uh, I did a set in front, you know, like literally like maybe five or six people, but I did, it is hard as I would do it in a regular room and I heard in the back, Paul Mooney going right,

Speaker 8:          02:37:25       ah, ah,

Speaker 3:          02:37:29       laugh, laughing and support. You know how Paul Mooney would laugh and support and you would go, oh shit, I just got the green light from Paul fucking Mooney. Like Paul Mooney was laughing at my shit. Then he came up to me after a show and he goes, he goes, you're a real comic. He's like, you did that show in front of all those people. And he goes, you knew that there was five fucking people in that room. You did that show. Like it was packed and does, that's a real comic. He goes, you made me laugh. That's what you learn to become. It kind of like a, Paul Mooney says that to you when you're just coming up, you're like, Holy Shit. Like, I might be able to figure this out. I might be able to do this.

Speaker 3:          02:38:04       It's big, right? Someone coming up to you, you know, it's crazy when you do a spot at the store, you low, you're in the big leagues Bro. Like no matter where I do a spot, when I travel, that's one day when I'm at the store on Thursday night, Tuesday night, you know, you're in some fucking good company. You're doing something right or you did something right. Yes. I love when comics are in the room. I love laughing at comics. I love going to the stolen early and catch and two or three great calming. So laughing and that makes my fucking night. Whether it's you or even Bobby Lee is so fucking out of his mind on stage. You know, lately we've been getting around whites and the fucking uh, Bill Gilbert. Yeah. Yeah. I mean Ron White, Bill Burr last week there was a lineup last how's there? All the time. There was a lineup last week that was just ridiculous and two weeks ago, but then I saw you down there.

Speaker 3:          02:39:02       That was just ridiculous. Places on fire. I the weighed down. I have anxiety, you know, I puked on the car one time on the way down there from the anxiety of going down and following while I'm having this surgery at March 5th for your ear? Yeah. And what do they have to do exactly? Put a tube in there. Whoa. To drain the fluid. What's, what fluids in your ear? Whenever I have, it's getting to the point where with some brown for the last six months I've been living with plugs. When I go to the shower now I got weigh a blog when they go to git. So why? What's going on with your ears? Because the fluid goes in. I don't know dog. I stuck a bean in my head when I was six. I was playing that game, please. I spill the beans and then you stuck when you're here and fucked it up and they couldn't get it out and I just left it, then brought it over. It went in there. My mother put hot oil in there. They took all out. Where the fuck Oh, they took her to a chair. So they wrecked my esl. Today I get a doctor didn't take it out. Yeah, I went up to La, uh, the, the Jewish hospital 68th and Broadway. That how that's hurting my ear. Just thinking about it. So now, 50 years later, because my driving

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       or whatever, now I get carsick oh look, equilibrium. So I have to even wear ear plugs when I walked, go on walks and the tide, I got to wear ear plugs because if not, the sweat goes in my ear. You know what I used to get a terrible fucking car sickness from trying to read a book in a car. Oh yeah. You cannot do anything like that. The car after a while, you're just like all, especially with reading glasses at this really poor design and try to read your twitter Jack, come around that turn where the four or five hits the one o one and see what happens to your fucking stomach. It's a weird thing, huh? Motion sickness. Some people get it all the time. I get it all the time. Not, I'm playing, it's not, I get it. If I get high and get on a boat, go down the Jersey shore, getting on a boat, I'm done.

Speaker 2:          02:41:02       I got to take the pills I was at treat those pills. Drama mean that stuff is brutal. That stuff is rather BCC. You gotta be tired. I'd rather be sick. I'll throw up. I don't give a fuck. That sucks. But at least I don't feel like I'm drugged out. Like I fell asleep in a diner. Me and my friend Jimmy Utilia, we went out blue fish fishing. I'm on those tea party boats and the way home we stopped at a darn and gets on me. I literally fell asleep head down on the table. I literally was like drugged out where you are. The drama being. Yeah. It was on drama, Maine and I was only like 150 pounds back then. 154 pounds. That was like what, what I was weighing when I was competing and uh, I'd never did anything. I didn't do anything. I didn't drink.

Speaker 2:          02:41:46       I didn't smoke pot and then I didn't do shit. So in that drama, meaning in my system, my sister was like, check please. It just shut down. I couldn't hear. I had no tolerance at all. I fell completely asleep at a diner, but I tried to take with my friend Jimmy took, he's way bigger than me. I think I just overdosed. It will be, it's just something where the Harvey Weinstein gets out of Rehab and he wants to come on the podcast. We do let them month. Um, I let them out of, you're coming on to why? Because we're going to have some fun with them. Oh yeah, it's hot box him. We want that. We want the fucking real for that. She's got some crazy, you can't, you can't, you can't have them anywhere. You know that guy, especially in the middle. We were joking around folks, especially in the middle of a trial, because he's in the middle of like a ton of trial.

Speaker 2:          02:42:29       Oh, well he comes back, he's going to get charged. I for sure something's going to happen. There's so many different trials in terms of like civil lawsuits and stuff and it's a lot of women saying he did horrible things. It's undoubtedly, there's no way he's going to skate. Something's to happen. Something civic trial, criminal trial. Some days I have several trials. Absolutely. We're changing as a species. That's what's happening and in the way it's like we're making it up as we go along and there's a lot of rocky things that are happening, a lot of chaos and, but this is awareness of like what you should and shouldn't do to human beings in terms of like forcing yourself on people and you know fucking them when they say no, it's like rape and

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       the idea that we're still doing that in 2018 and people are doing it at a really high level. It's like boy, bye of creepy. Thanks. I'm over to this fucking town. Of course, right off the bat, soon as I got here, I heard the creepiest pocket things. Boy You got into like the movies, like I heard he was creepy things and I saw creepy bayview and listen, Ben, you've ever want to call a fucking spade a spade because you're getting in trouble. But you look at Kevin, what's his name? Spark was event. Which guy? Kevin Spacey and Kevin Spacey. You can't tell he sucks. Dick puncher knew he would suck a dick part time and we looked at Kevin Spacey. If you look at that fucking dude, Lee Harvey Weinstein, you can't tell that. That dude would make you suck his dick before. Think about that and all of these people took pictures with him.

Speaker 3:          02:44:04       Would that be to the fuck? Are they agents that actually sent you on that mission to Lee harveys fucking hotel room? I want to know where the fuck they are. They didn't know that Lee Harvey was going to come out with a massage and asked you to suck his fucking deck or watch them naked pro. We knew for a long fucking time. Everybody knew when there's a fucking gap, when you have a dream and you have power, a lot of things could happen. I mean, I'm no fucking liberace, but I got my Dick's up at the comedy store just because of being a comedian and some real thought that you were like had supernatural powers. It's fucking crazy. And if you don't know about fucking Hollywood, listen man, they'd been fucking people till they're dead for you. Look at this fucking Marilyn Monroe. They kicked that bitch and you don't, who else was a dirty motherfucker? That fucking liberace. That guy was making you sign contracts making you fucking have plastic surgery making you have places like clam him. Are you fucking kidding me? There's been some creepy fucking shit in this town you got away with for fucking zillions. He is. And now I tell you what, man, I'm more for the movement. I'm all for it. I have a daughter. You have daughters. I have sisters. I got friends. I tell you would fucking bothers me the most. I tell. The only thing that bothers me out of this, you know what bro?

Speaker 3:          02:45:28       Who was in pappy on with Steve Mcqueen? I don't remember Dustin Hoffman was him. If he fingered bank, get a 73 shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. People changed. I'm not the same guy who kidnap can't bell in 1987 I'm not sorry Joe. I'm not. So how are you going to come back at me about something I didn't like deep bought an 87 I was a different guy. I was doing blow. I had asked you to finger bang yet you can't do that. That I don't want to do. Don't let somebody fucking career cause he stuck a finger in your ass and 92 and now it came back to you to the scale of Amnesia. You can't do that to me. You want to call me out personally, call me the fuck out. Call me at home and go, hey man, in [inaudible] 94 one that you asked me if you could eat my ass hole, who said you were wrong?

Speaker 3:          02:46:16       Listen, I was doing an eight ball a day. What do you want from me? All right. I resolved that issue that I understand, but don't call me out on something like that. 1972 people fucking change pro. That's what pissed me off. Giant. There's a tiny gaps we're talking about like the chair pivot and it was 1985 and don't fucking call me out. If you call me out, call me out with a friend. Whether you're talking about, look at what level though, if it gets to rape a dog. Hold on. Listen, the way I come from, that's not even allowed. That word never entered my mind. I'm talking about if I was coked out of the bar one night. Now what I'm telling, I told you I'd tell these were banging and I want to put a coke rock in your asshole. You can't come at me for some in 1988 cause I used to do what every other night.

Speaker 3:          02:47:05       That was my opening line. Listen, your ass hoes on fire. What's it gonna take for me to stick my tongue in that fucking thing and make that thing you know you're not going to listen. You're not going to get a piece of ass by selling somebody real estate. You've got to sell them Dick. Well, the ones that it works on, that's the ones you want. Like if you can go up to a gal and say that to her, Oh, you gotta write me already. Where if I knew who you were a girl and I knew you did coke and you had that certain look in your eyes, what's the cluck to the look? That is when you do cocaine, you do dirty fucking things. So when you look at a girl that's doing cocaine and she's like, she suggest to you that she's going back to your hotel with you.

Speaker 3:          02:47:51       It's time. Nobody goes back to the hotel with you when they have a boyfriend. If you're doing coke at time, because percentages keep getting go higher and higher. What Cook apparently makes people promiscuous, right? Right. It makes people go fucking bananas to go suck a Dick. So you take somebody who's wife up to your hotel room and then 6:00 AM she's doing coke with you. You'll notice that one of the times she comes out of the bathroom, the button, it'll be opened. You know what I'm saying? Then the next time she comes out, she'll come out to tell you a story and her pants will come out and show button them in front of the little things start to happen if you signs and pretty soon you're like, listen, nothing. Nothing. Take off your pants. I'm gonna see you play with your pussy. Do, do, do, do, do, do.

Speaker 3:          02:48:38       That's what the, what gets me right now is the, the 20 year call out, the 30 call. I ain't going to ruin Dustin Hoffman's Korea. Yeah. He was giving out foot rubs. He was asking him ask him acting creepy black. You know what bro? Part of that shit, we allow that creepiness and society. We turned our fucking heads. You follow them saying, I'm sure you're not the type of return you had. No, I'm not the type of turning my head, but I noticed that you didn't notice it. The cocaine thing is a, is a real interesting one because you see people making crazy decisions. Just real nutty fucking decisions. Oh, you sell a tonin men of pounding everything. So what y'all [inaudible] system. So your whole system's delusional. I remember going out like after a long night and not sleeping. Okay. Now that comes to a point where you have this paranoia where you don't leave the house, but now that comes through with paranoid that you're going to leave the house and bump into somebody and guess what?

Speaker 3:          02:49:39       Sometimes you actually do, you go to a seven 11 together soda and you bump into somebody who was in the same predicament as you. That happened to me once I was, I went by Gavin's I think I was staying with Ralphie and I went by Gavin's and I'm the first floor. They was just checked that we used to be a stripper and she had a daughter that was about 13 kind of ugly. She always like Pavarotti. We used to call it bob or cause she had thick fucking eyebrows and shit, but the mother was kind of a freak and I got up like that. Like I was up all night and it was like nine in the morning and I was about to call my drug dealer. They get a package of 11 that keep the body alive and I bumped into that animal to stay away and she asked me like, you know, I got some coke, I was on my way and that chick, that chick was in gay, Ooh, I'll never forget this.

Speaker 3:          02:50:33       She was engaged and like, well I'm on my way right now. And she goes, do you want to split the gram? I go, yeah, yeah, let's put the grab. It was like 30 bucks. We went over there, we split the fucking grand and we went back. Her daughter was sleeping so we had to do the coke in the hallway on the first floor. All right. Under the stairway, you know what I'm saying? And after we did two blanks, we were just thinking they are looking at each other and she was like, don't even ask. I just told the guy that was bothering me all night that I wouldn't give him a site. Like, oh listen, it's 10 in the morning, you know, do something, man. We got to do something. And I started swapping spit. What the next thing you know, she's stuck in the helmet and when I went to come, she goes, don't do that.

Speaker 3:          02:51:16       And I came on a jeans, uh, like it was all over her jeans. It's 1130 in the morning and you come on some of these genes, you're coked up. I felt like a piece of shit. That's what the worst of it. I see her three nights later and I'll come by audrey and she's with her boyfriend and her boyfriend comes over to him and he goes, hey man, we might have a problem here. And I'm like, what? What's going on? He goes, my, my girl was a little bit angry. I don't know what happened, but I think you should apologize. I felt like when I came on the pants, I was just suck my dick. That's what happened. Did she tell you that? That's how crazy to coke world is? Oh my God. Like she told her boyfriend, she was angry at me. It's none of your business.

Speaker 3:          02:52:00       Why? But so he came over to me, cause I don't know what's going on. You're a nice guy. I don't know what's going on. I felt like going, you know why she blew me a letter in the morning. I was like, came on the jeans. I shot a load of the jeans. She couldn't fucking, you know what? What are you spraying your genes to get shit off? I'm going to shout it out. She put the shout out that spur, if she fucking wanted to that old coach Carter, no vitamins in my system. I weighed 380 pounds. Those genes were stayed for lifetime.

Speaker 3:          02:52:36       Oh. Uh, uh, I did the dumbest shit on all those drugs. The dumbest shit. And especially the year it took me to get off it. What's going on? Someone at our door. Oh, okay. Who the fuck is this page? You may have five 46 in the morning. Crack of dawn and what's going on his own fedex, probably someone dropping something off. Um, anyway, my brother told nothing. We got to get out of here eventually. All right, I'm going to leave eventually. I'm good. I'm having a good time. It was good to see you. I'm just getting to see you too, man. Jamie, my man. I thought about you when I saw fucking the cramps and ty come back against them. I thought about you. Who'd you bet I lost on that one? I had told me to check. Check part lands some stuff. Ah, fuck. Like I don't go straight up.

Speaker 3:          02:53:26       You love those sucker bets are going to go straight up. It's winning the lottery. Why when 20 bucks when you can win 200 no, because I'd rather them raise my percentage of bet one and double up on it and you just worry about one. Why am I sweating to moves through the fucking minor sweat to most? I don't want to get in that long game. Oh my God. Fall too deep like you're talking about. But who the fuck this is? What's the next fight on the car? We got some great cards to go over the rock over Merrill fight. That's Great Romero. And then when you got March 7th Khabib against Tony Ferguson. Shit in Brooke coming at you from all directions. That's going to be Brooklyn, New York. Are you doing this show that weekend? Isn't it April? It's April, right? April. What's the exact date? April 7th I believe.

Speaker 3:          02:54:11       Fuck cats. That's a crazy fight. That has a hard time. I'm at a rock 'em sock. 'Em robots fight. That's who the fuck knows fight. You know that's one of those fights where you're like, whoa, that's going to be a crazy one. Tony Ferguson's a bad mother fucker and Khabib Nijmegen Madoff is already one of the scariest guys have ever seen compete ever. Malls people already. This is his first shot at the title. Just stop and think of what, what happens if that fucking savage gets the title? That guy some mash. It's people. What he did to Edson Barboza was super natural. It's like he's not even the same thing. You said something during that fight that said it all. There was one point of the fight that you said, look at the look in essence face. Yeah, and I've had that look and that's when you're getting chased by 18 people. He had

Speaker 4:          02:55:04       a look that heated. No, no hitting. No hope. He went into like a survival situation. Like, like when you see a deer that's getting attacked by a crocodile or something, they have this like survival thing where you're like, you're just trying to survive. Obviously deer is not the same. I that's terrible analogy. Hold on, let me correct this. What I think is that Barboza had realized that like there's no way he's going to beat this guy on the ground. It's not even close. Like I think if he went to that fight, probably thought he'd be able stuff more take downs and probably be able to get back off his feet because he was doing that with a lot of guys in camp. But once that guy gets a hold of you, there's an acceptance that certain fighters go through where they, they're locked down like holy shit.

Speaker 4:          02:55:47       Like they're just drained from this animal mall and them trying to retain their energy, trying to recharge their battery, trying to get back in it. And you've got to realize that guy that's in proposals, one of the best fucking kickers ever, ever. He's one of the best kickers ever. That fucking guys, the fastest switch kick I've ever seen in my life outside of like professional Moitai like San Chai or blue cow or something like that. He's got a world class left leg kick. I mean woo, he's fast as fuck. He couldn't keep that guy off him and it was so scary. That guy's face to me where he drilled for hours. He drilled, take down the fence, he drove everything that was, but he never drove this, couldn't do it. Like there was one point where he looked and it was like, wait a second, I've done everything I can.

Speaker 4:          02:56:38       I, I even trained with the giants taking me down for a week. Different animal. It felt this depending on how he keeps you down on either, his control on that side is fucking something that is, there's certain guys that have a grappling skill that it's very hard to see when you look at it. Even if you're a skillful glow grappler yourself, you're looking at someone like you like why is he able to do that to everybody? Like what? What is he doing differently? Like, why is this one guy being able to do certain things and other people can't do? And there's a few of those guys out there while you're watching me just go Jesus, like what the fuck? And but Comedians, the number one guy in that category, because he's never been defeated. He said one moment of adversity in the octagon. I get clipped by a punch from Michael Johnson.

Speaker 4:          02:57:24       I can't think of a single round. He's lost. Not off the top of my head at least. I mean he may have lost rounds on some judges' scorecards, but he's essentially mauled every motherfucker they put in front of him. He's an animal. So this guy versus Tony, it's phenomenal fight. Cause Tony is a savage and Tony fights very well off of his back. He is a seriously dangerous guard. You can't sleep on him. He's durable as fuck. He can knock you out. He never gets tired. And he's, his game is, they come and he's a fucking champ right now. He's the interim champ. You know when he beat Kevin Leave with a triangle, you'd beat a top guy like Kevin leave with a fucking triangle. That's a big move.

Speaker 2:          02:58:01       Tony's dangerous, nasty, dark chokes is darce choke is one of the best, was great, but he wasn't ready for Talia. Kevin Leach was sick to his staff. That's, that's that action. But note unquestionably hurt. He wasn't totally as it's too high level. That was to, you could see in the second round perhaps. I would like to see that fight to get what you, you have to say that because that's how it went down. Sorry. But I think that if you wanted to have them fight again and Kevin Lee can go into that fight healthy, I think you'd see a very different fight. I don't think you would see tony. I'm not saying that you would see tony lose or Kevin when, but I would think you would see a Kevin Lee that could sustain its performance longer. I think being drained from staff is just, there's no judge, there's no effect.

Speaker 2:          02:58:45       I've had it before. It's the worst. Your body. It's not the worst, but it's not good. Your body goes into a very weakened state. It's your, you are not the same thing. You're just not. You can, if you're a real professional and you can go out there and do your job. And a lot of guys have, a lot of guys have fought in one. Luke rockhold beat Chris Weidman on antibiotics. How about that? He was fighting off staff when he beat Chris fucking Weidman. That's how good Luke rockhold is. Guys have done it, but that's not him at 100% he wanted, he wanted 70 or 80 or whatever the fuck it was. You know, there's no doubt about it. Staph infections and antibiotics both fuck you up. And Kevin Lee, I believe, opted to not take the antibiotics. So after the fight, so he didn't want to weaken the system, but he's still weakened by the staff.

Speaker 2:          02:59:27       Fuck fuck. Oh shoot. Demetrius Johnson versus Tj dillashaw. Superfight targeted for UFC two 26 and co main event. Oh Shit. Two 26 that I dunno. July Vegas. Hello? Steve Bay DC fight. Oh good. Oh, that's a big court case. I'm Bro. They got some good cards coming up. That's what Greg is. Kevin Co sleep don't sleep motherfucker. This game might run by by his ship, whose mother fucking fights are getting better and better now. Again, I'd love to see Steve Bay become a superstar. Me Too. I think. I think he deserves it. And I think you look at where that guy is right now. Like what is more American than this guy? Like you said with his immigrant named what is more American than a guy who works right now as a fireman while he's the UFC heavyweight champion of the world. And he's a great dude. Good, good. And broke the record.

Speaker 2:          03:00:20       Broke the record for the most defensive. He's beat the scariest contender we've seen in a decade. You know. Uh, I watched the podcasts a lot. Yeah. Had those guys aren't here. We're talking about the Tao of Jeet Guido. And I think that a lot of people really miss out on the main thing. And this is what you miss out with me every time. It's not with you. No, no, no. I don't. Other people. You mean like whenever I want to see is Bruce Lee fucking things and I see these kids are the 30 talking about Bruce Lee. I get sick to my stomach because Bruce Lee that bring martial arts for this country. Then he caved immigrants. Hope Bro.

Speaker 3:          03:01:01       I was a kid. I just come from Cuba to Green Horn in on Sunday nights. I would throw you out the window to watch that show when I was five and then they canceled them and then he came back with the first one that supposed to be fist of fury, but some argue that was a flat that didn't do that good that introduced him. It was the one in [inaudible] 71 the Chinese connection when I was eight. That was a great model that really put this country over. If you were, it didn't mean you were a tough guy. How many, how many I youtube, how many black guys are there that think that Chinese is and they got wisdom. What was the guy used to send you videos of, forget the guy's name, but he's a bunch of those things. Make people tougher. He gave immigrants blacks. He gave them hope.

Speaker 3:          03:01:56       How many black dudes started dressing like Bruce Lee and you know, doing crazy shit and wearing gunning fool our kung fu outfits. You know everybody's wrong about Bruce Lee because I saw it and I saw his death and I saw how people would go to Chinatown because there was no internet can confined kind. They go to Seattle. They go to is greg. I went to his grave, I went to his grave, took a picture and gave it to Eddie Griffin. That's why Eddie Griffin will always be indebted to me cause I gave him a picture of Bruce Lee's brave and just shit. That's how I Bruce Lee, when he died there was no internet. They didn't report per sleeve that on the news. How did people find out about it? You found out a week later when the trainees newspaper Hit New York and then in China town, it came out through China town.

Speaker 3:          03:02:43       When I heard about it, I was forced to go to China town and get the paperwork with the pictures. But everybody had to, it was an open casket and China and the open casket was glass around him and to him, nobody believed Bruce Lee was that then enter the dragon came out. But I bing Bada boom, everybody made $1 million and nobody said nothing but his debt browth fucked people up. Like, you know Bruce Lee gave hope because the Vietnam War was going on and there was something else going on in this country that people don't remember that destroyed this country. You know, which shot this country down. What? When the Beatles broke up this fucking Christ. Did people lose that mind? So you always get into arguments with people led. Zap One's a good bat. Yeah, but wait til the beetles get back together, bitch, because they were always threatening you with the Beatles talk.

Speaker 3:          03:03:40       I like jethro Tull. Yeah, but they're not nothing compared to the Beatles. So until John Lennon got shot, then those people had a voice. Fuck you at the Beatles, bitch. You know what you were? Springsteen is the man. You know what you would love. Go to the Mirage show to the Beatles, a Cirque de Solei show. It's called love fucking crap. When did you go credible? A couple of weeks ago. You were there doing it with my family. Okay. And W I wanted to see the Cirque de Solei show. It's supposed to be amazing and I seen the original circus de Soleil. Well, this guy, nobody would have met the Beatles, broke up this country, went to a tough time. You have no fucking id now. You don't have any idea if you're, you're young, you have no fucking idea. Put it in perspective. The Beatles, let let it be out. In the end of that, we'll let it be dog.

Speaker 3:          03:04:27       That was it. People will crack White People Crack Jack fucking incredible song. When you think about what John died with, John, let him die. What happened in New York that Sunday? You think about that? That was amazing to look at. Now he was on another level. The whole band was on another level. They were very psychedelic, mostly came in at the perfect time, right? The Beatles were breaking up. Muhammad Ali, Muhammad Ali, but also in 1973 this is a very interesting fact. At $50, at $15 ticket sales at $15, $12, $10 ticket sales. This country gross, $3 billion and concerts really go watch the 70s on CNN. The one of my music, I can't say I'm the seventh. So much good music came out of that time, that era. Every school was on tour. They had a list of who was on tour Zeppelin, the stones. Uh, the whole, when I was in high school, we always went to concerts.
