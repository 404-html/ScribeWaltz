Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Let me tell you something. You know how bad to the bone I do this. I was just still on the way up beat Eddie Bravo is the one who called me and reached, turned me on to Tom Petty. Tom Petty was bad about the firearm. That fucking, that something song was on the way up. Yeah. I almost crashed the fucking cop. He doesn't get much respect. I don't know why people when they talk about like rock stars, they really love you don't hear a lot of people like people go off about like I always go off back a Hendrix or people go off about certain artists, but you don't hear that much of a fucking Anthea. That's that what it is. But you don't like Getty Lee, same thing for us. That fucking guy drives me crazy. Yeah, no, that shit drives me crazy. It's singer from reo Speedwagon with the needle shoulders and Mario Spit, which had a good life back when we were kids.

Speaker 1:          00:00:40       That was a bad ass fucking or we'll come back back on the Road Gan given that what time I'm leaving, uh, they were fucking bad ass. But the prom with Tom Petty's, it looks like a rat. But if you know anything about Tom Petty, he's deep in it. Dog. He's like, Hey, he's a good Gracie. He took guitar lessons from the guitar player, from the Eagles in high school. Did you get from that area where white people and I trash white trash, but they know how to fucking play an instrument like, like at Jacksonville, that area. He's from like Jackson's though. Uh, okay. So Jacksonville is like them. Uh, you know, not to let us get it, but the other band that was, uh, that Jackson's the Allman brothers like gap. You can see it. Oh, I get it now I get the whole, Oh, that's what the Allman brothers from Florida to yas, Bro, that neighborhood is leaked.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       Or like if you go online, that neighborhood, like I went online one day, um, I know that it's either or either Tom Petty. Just think about that. The guitar player from Eagles, the one that wrote Hotel California, when they threw out that lives right up in Topanga Canyon. That dude, that dude's a powerhouse, all that [inaudible] now all that was him. Joe Walsh joined later. But the early power house was that dude when he has rings around his nose on Hotel California with blow, that dude's a savage and he and the high school, he gave Tom Petty Guitar lessons and people don't know that. And they can you imagine and that's like, that's like, you know, that's like, that's like the Machados Gracie's like they were just hanging out in the basement. They were cousins. That's what they did. And they all launched from there. The Allman brothers. It's gotta be somebody else from that area.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       I don't know who it is that's from that fucking area. A lot of people don't know that. That's a weird, you're getting it from that area. Yeah, I mean just get it. Oh, I'm in brothers and Tom Petty. I know for a fact I could, I can't lose this argument. Tom Petty's got 10 songs that we've all sung at one time. That fucking song from when the guys dancing naked and the, and silence Atlanta. So there's Dick between his legs, American girl. That's all time batty guys. That's all time patty. The one with Brock, the dude that good looking guy. Pirates of the Caribbean. Remember he had that video with the dude from the pirates of the Caribbean with dance, with Mary Jane Doe. That dude

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       does not the one with Stevie nicks when we were kids. Stop dragging my heart around. Fuck yeah, I forgot about me not gonna. Look, I'm getting goosebumps cause he's like Muhammad Ali. He just stuck around for 20 that's 83 it's 2000 fucking 15 that's seven. That's 17 that's 32 fucking years. I know he's still around and he's still, he's still around. Wow. You know, you forget about those fucking guys. Like how, but that area, what is the water? It's gotta be something. They just had something at that time. You know what that was like. They're all growing up in the 70s and the culture was probably exploding from the whole, all the crazy shit from the 60s a lot of people from the east coast escaped and they went down to Florida. You know, that's what happened to a lot of people. A lot of mob guys went down to Florida.

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       A lot of people went down to Florida to go on the land. A lot of people went down to Florida to get away from debts to get away from the east coast like the Florida is a big part of Florida is like escape savages from like Jersey and New York. That's a, that's the dirty secret about Florida. There's as many New York accents and some parts of Florida. Is there anywhere else you want to Tampa? Yeah, Yankee hot dogs and that's where the Yankees spring training. Listen, when I rubbed that jewelry store, I went to Sarasota and the laminate e three that was nothing to do. I had to go to watch the road warrior every day for a month. I got it was theory about Florida. I got a theory about Florida. I think it's too hot. I think that's why people are so dopey down there.

Speaker 2:          00:04:23       I think it's too hot. No, I think you can. If you take those animals from New Jersey and New York that was in the set, they're like, it just got there. They just got their, they, their personalities were developed in the cold weather. Their personalities would develop it. You've got to get shit done. It's cold. You got a fucking shovel your car out and then you'd go down to Florida and it's just swatting bugs and sweating. Just that deep, deep fog of a hot day in Miami fog. The fog of the moisture in the air. Fuck. What about an Arizona though? We didn't know that. My aunt, southern Florida morning, you know when you're there when you wake up and there's dew on the window and you opened up and it smells tremendous of a flyer. The morning Chenelle was tremendous. That grass with that moisture on it. But now tell me about this thing outside of Fort Lauderdale.

Speaker 2:          00:05:16       You were telling me once and then somebody was telling me in Fort Lauderdale one time, what's going to happen in that ocean? It's going to sink. There's, there's an area around Miami, like all around southern Florida, which the ground is very porous. It's, it's not like Louisiana where you can like put up a levee and you can keep the water from coming in. You can't stop it. It's going to come through the, through the ground. The ground is not this, you know, rock hard from ground that we get up here while we're right next to the water. It's not like that. So as the water level rises, it's going to be no way to stop it. It's going to come right through the ground. Swampy. Yeah. When it comes to the ground, that's the everglades and that's,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       you know, any, any swampy type area. And when it comes to the ground, it's gonna eat up Miami. It's just going to eat it up. It's not going to last. Miami not going to be here in a hundred years ago. Who used to say that? Do you know who my mother's, that's why she didn't go to Miami. She's smart. She left Cuba, kept asking, why didn't you ever go to Miami? Those Cubans? She goes, and I'm like, it that. She goes, they position those missiles from there to shoot or something. She was telling me, Oh yeah, that's where I don't want to fucking human being something about Miami. The land, the land's not going to be right there. And she hated it. She fucking hate in Miami with a passion, especially in her era. Uh, you know, that was when the Cuban missile crisis was going on and everybody felt that the Russians are going to launch nukes from Cuba's right there.

Speaker 1:          00:06:39       I mean, a lady swam it, she swam it. I mean, what the fuck man do you mean you could probably, I mean it people, everyday people raft it, that little boy. Remember that little rap that every day when you go to Cuba right now and you put it on this street, I'm digging it, going out this be some Guy Mackey, and he'll break it down to you don't leave at six because the high tide, they already have it. They've done it. They've done it, and maybe come back and got arrested in Cuba and the United States and come back. You know, they said there's a point when you're out there that you just see all the wraps. If people that have failed, oh my God. And that's when, you know there's like 30, 40 miles out of Miami, you know, uh, 50 miles out of the United States. They say it crack a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:07:23       That's where you really tight. That's the fifth round. And this is silver is on top of your ground and pounding and you're, you know, it's, you're just looking into the abyss. There's nothing. And once it gets dark they say you just hear some fucking wall noises, man. Oh, so fucking while noisy. No, you can't drink the salt water. So you got to bring the water with, you got to keep the raffle light. So you've got to bring like saltine crackers. I mean it's, it's any days it take, it's all depending on the time, you know, I don't really know. I've spoken to people who have done it. Cubans that you up to like listen to your conversation about the fucking show last night and listened to this like they have yet. And all the fucking documentaries they do have not sat down like a family like that came with six and they lost three.

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       And you talked to those mother fuckers and you haven't, don't look at the picture from the Yankees. Eight his hand, he started cannibalizing his own fucking hand. What? Because he and then he broke down in it. I get emotional thinking of just like psychological, psychological. He started eating his hand, had no food, so when he, the first time the Yankees gave him 10 million, he went into the clubhouse and he saw the cold cuts and he broke down. He had a nervous breakdown. He had never seen that much food like fruit and cold cuts and bread and you know sodas. He had never seen that. That's just the intensity of it, but there's nobody yet. There's a, there's a documentary. It's real interesting and called bud settle about size.

Speaker 3:          00:08:57       That's that generation. The Cubans having the Marielle escape, Lomaia lethal. Those are the ones that came in [inaudible] 79 and then you have the 90s ones and they called the Cubans look down on them. The Marielitos like, fuck you punks. Your boss said it was, they're the ones that come and truck tires. Jesus fucking truck. How many days does it take? Normally three to at all. You know, I this be intelligent people watch the show and that sitting there going Joey, it all depends. It's not like you could count the days wherever the tide takes you, you know it was going to be, my question is do people ever miss I? Why? Do you ever like go? Does it take you out to see every x? Some people, the tie goes a different direction. I'm sure that when you go to, they have the jets rooms. I mean not the jet streams, like pretty predictable.

Speaker 3:          00:09:46       Like that's how they have those garbage patches, right? Some people get caught in those islands by The Bahamas. You have to look at the map and we could really, some people actually landed on the island by the heart pump. You're still not home because you're still, they could still a restaurant. So if I'm choke, Fidel has flights going through out there looking for people. Those mother fuckers, they get back to Cuba and a restaurant. So until you touch the United States, what are you writing? A tide map. There's such things as tight naps for boating and stuff. That would show you the tides of the eye unless you touch the sec. So, so close. So those islands right there from, I see the tip, you probably have to leave from the northwest dial, like right under key west. You'd have to leave. But I guarantee there's a problem.

Speaker 3:          00:10:32       I guarantee there's some type of problem. So you have to hit it depending on what's going on. Some people live lead lead from the southern point and they catch something at The Bahamas, those little islands, The Bahamas has over a hundred little islands over there, a hundred little islands by The Bahamas. All those little islands used to be drug smuggling islands. That's the midway point. So that, that, that's it right there. But think about that. That's 90 miles. That's from head to San Diego. That's a legit, so the first 30 miles is pretty easy. The next 30 of the real fucking deal. And then I imagine you start seeing land, but uh, once you run out of water, you start hallucinating when you can't drink the salt water. Correct. So you started loosening. I mean, I've heard different things and let's put that back up again, Jamie. That'd be a very interesting documentary that just see somebody take off from Cuba and fucking just like a survivor man thing, but that seems like something he was, yeah, that's a look at that fucking look at the distance. It's so small. She would looks bigger than I thought it looked, but these maps were really like distorted. It's very difficult to gauge the perspective, like how big Cuba actually is. Like a, when you look at like Africa and the United States on a map, like a lot of times it doesn't look like Africa's that much bigger. But then if you actually see how big Africa is, if you ever seen that Africa fits like almost all the other countries, it's like

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       you're, yeah, it fits everything. Like pull up a map of how many different countries fit inside Africa because it's, it's pretty crazy to look at. It's, it's so big. Look at that. That's All Africa. So I look at all the different fucking Sylvia, the United States. It's like a little piece of it. It's like maybe a quarter of it. Look all of eastern Europe. China. Yup. China fits in in, in Africa. That's how big Africa is. Spain, France or excuse me, for Rawls, Germany, Italy, eastern Europe and fucking India. Good Lord. And then it says India part too. So I guess that's another segment of India or they just stuffed in there and I made it feel like a fucking Africa. And that's when you just get petrified. Oh, and all the UK, the whole UK fucker. When you see what's an Africa is when you really fucking just shut the map.

Speaker 2:          00:12:48       Like you're like, I could sell y the x asis was that cause in my mind the exorcism is dead. That's where it started. Look at the fucking countries, like everywhere. There's always a fucking fentanyl going on. Always something going on Morocco that smoking Hash, Tunisia who fucking know Libya. They fucking up, you know, Sudan and fucking up Egypt. That fucking Ethiopia is the fucking up look at all the fucking reason. You know Rwanda, there's a war always. I mean there's always signed goal, a Zombie. I mean there's always something. So Bob Way, Africa, Zimbabwe, Somalia, the most corrupt city in the world supposed to be Nigeria. Nigeria is that Nigeria, one of those where they have all the uh, Ma, uh, the scams on emails where your money's in an African Bank. That's the most corrupt city, the cops, everything. Everything goes down in Africa. Look at that, look at that.

Speaker 2:          00:13:38       Where's the Liberia? You ever see those of vice specials on Liberia and fucking of Somali and pirates come fucking crazy mother fuckers that are out there. Yeah. Well you know the Somalian pirates, you know how it all got started. There were fishermen and a, the Europeans kept dumping shit into the ocean and they were killing all the fish are throwing like nuclear waste overboard and shit and all kinds of fucking chemical pollutants. They just would dump their waste out outside the shore of Somalia and it was killing all their fish and these people were starving so they started kidnap and these boat guys and you know, holding them for ransom saying, hey, you owe us. You've been fucking up our ocean. You know we want money and they were making so much money doing that. They said fuck fishing and they just started robbing people and they take this stuff called cat.

Speaker 2:          00:14:25       It's like a, it's like an amphetamine. It's a plant that they chew and that it has like an amphetamine effects. So they're fucking just hopped up on speed all day long, just gay and they're running around with guns and they're just fucking, they give a f zero fucks. They don't give a fraction of a fuck. When they get on those speed boats and head towards your oil tanker, they start throwing anchors up there, grappling hooks and shit pull themselves up. They're just not scared of you at all. Their crazy fucks those guys are, have you ever seen videos with those guys? But they're scary. It's scary. They're wild man. They come after people up, going on the ship around. Anyway, with those motherfuckers out there, in a lot of ways it's very lord of the rings s you know, it's like, it's kind of like unbelievable when you see these groups of dudes that are all skinny and kind of cracked out and they got machine guns and then her a rubber tube with a fucking engine attached to it and they're shooting at this giant boat and they throw it hooks up and climbing up, getting inside.

Speaker 2:          00:15:32       How is that any different than some scenes from the Lord of the Rings? That's crazy. That's like the elves versus the trolls and Shit, you know? I mean these guys are mad men. The Matton men and most likely all that shit started out because people were fucking with their livelihood. They're like a peaceful fishing village and people were polluting their water and they didn't have any food, so they started getting dangerous. They started getting desperate. That's a crew. They call themselves the, the volunteer coast guard of Somalia. That's what they started off as. It makes sense. Fucking totally makes sense. Why they would be so angry. Well, I mean, well, how come they never did it before? How come Somalia doesn't have like a deep history of pirating? You know, it's not like we know, you know, it's not like we think of them as like Vikings.

Speaker 2:          00:16:16       You know, if Vikings started robbing people again, we'd be like, it's in their blood. The video I seen, there wasn't one FESA Molly and they're all fucking bony up like Jesus, this skinny as fuck. And they move Jack. They pull up next to a ship and they move. It's like flux, Swat. Fuck. These guys don't give a fuck. And they throw all this shit out of, they lock up. But these guys don't get wet. And like the legal, it looks like Jimi Hendrix or goggles on. He doesn't know about fashion. Not Can, you know, it's uh, it's fucking scary. I Dunno. Different world. It's a different for fog. You grow up in that world and stayed out here, man. Those more the fuck is a savage is like real living fucking savages. And it's kind of interesting, Joe, if you really think about it like we don't have to be like that, but here we are.

Speaker 2:          00:17:02       It's 2015 in the same time when you and I are alive and very peaceful and getting along with everybody. This is going on in another part of the world. That's, that's the weird thing. It's like there's, we're not much different than them. We just, we was just, we're super lucky. We're super lucky. We got born into a better situation than them. These people are there right now in a war zone. That's like a Mad Max movie. I mean their life in a lot of parts of Africa, their life might as well be some crazy end of the world apocalypse movie. You know, if you go to watch the watch, the vice pieces on Liberia, it's Candace. This is like some of the shit. Fuck yeah. That's what part of it is. Okay. Right. The cannibalism selling. He said this guy was selling meat like human meet on the street in Kabobs and he said he recognized it because he knows what human meat tastes like because he used to kill babies as he used to fight naked.

Speaker 2:          00:17:55       This guy to calm general button naked. He would take off all his fucking clothes and going into combat with a machine gun, naked killing everybody killed thousands of people, thousands of people. Eight babies used to cut their heart out. You can find an innocent child of, of the enemy killed them, cut their heart out and eat pieces of their heart and they were immune to, to, to being damaged in battle. They couldn't die. That's what they felt. So they would do that. He's admitting this on this fucking special. Now here's where it gets really crazy. He became religious afterwards and now he's like a minister and he teaches, he preaches Christianity and because of that they're going to absolve him for all of the people he's killed. Who, who? The same guy, the country of whatever country he's in and I be Liberia. They absolve him.

Speaker 2:          00:18:47       They like let him off the hook because he's like a Christian now. It's like, Whoa, like this is going on right now. I mean, that guy killed thousands of people, thousands and admits on camera that that part of their ritual was to eat babies and people were like, well, you know it's a, he's different now. Now he's, he's found Jesus guy. He's got to pay for this somewhere. This one with the next one. But what my point was is like this is a very different world. How please not just a little limits, it's another day, Jack. It's another day. Traffic to us is another day. People somewhere else in the standards. These mother fuckers ain't and kids arts, babies' hearts not only die like how many atheists do you think are in Africa? I Bet I bet a lot less about a lot less than here. So when a guy says something like, I've found God now, now I've found Jesus.

Speaker 2:          00:19:39       That actually means something to them. Whether they go, wow, he's found God like this is, you're talking about a world that looks like a movie. That's what Africa is. I mean it's a world that looks like a move, like a crazy chaotic movie, like an asteroid hits China and kills almost everyone outside of the United States and kills 30 40% of the United States and then that that's Africa, the highly populated areas and be like Africa [inaudible] nine yeah. That movie just took nine very, very similar. Yeah, that's part of it. I mean then you also have Johannesburg. They also have like real stories. I mean it's weird to just so it's so fucking giant. I think the craziest thing I was so out of where I am was like the Bronx in the 80s I certain parts of the Bronx, I would leave there like going, I'm going to have a common here again.

Speaker 2:          00:20:30       That was a crazy, should we ever saw here again. Yeah. I can write one that I made a mistake like in 1980 and went through the Bronx to get drugs. I thought I was cool with some friends and we fucking went into a war zone. They were wars, which I don't know who was fighting. I have no idea but it was just dark and weapons. Nah, I like the regular things. I don't need to be in this fucking, that's the worst. I saw. I would a building on fire and not, I went, there was a building on fire, people yelling at the fire department. We didn't even go in because they know that the fucking people would rob him. It was like that movie I told you to watch robbed about Ken Norton. Muhammad I late that. It wasn't that that Muhammad Ali lost to Ken Norton that night.

Speaker 2:          00:21:12       The decision, it was what was going on outside in New York City. How people getting robbed on the streets. He you have him for the cops and the cops are turning their backs because they were overwhelmed. It was like four to one. They couldn't get all the cops and there they had blocked. They did it perfectly. They block cars and shit so no horses could get him at nothing. I'm telling you watch this. You're going to be like, what? How did this happen in 1970 that people from Manhattan rich are getting mugged and they are yelling for the cops to help him. And the cops were walking away like that's how crazy the Bronx was at one time when I was a kid and I didn't go up. That didn't live up there. I'm going to pet it, get drugs thinking, you know, like coke or weed or something stupid.

Speaker 2:          00:21:53       That's the worst. Well, there's so many people. The Bronx is so huge. There's so many people in like bad neighborhoods like or quote unquote bad neighborhoods, you know, lower class, poor neighborhoods in New York there's, there's big areas, big giant areas that have like a lot of, you know, what's the correct onset, lower class. What do you want to say? Like, uh, people that live in poverty, but there's, there's some spots, you know, I, uh, when the first one, the first things I did when I moved to New York, because I drove to Harlem and I'm like, I want to see what this is like, you know, I'm like, all right, I got here. It was my first day here. Let me go see what Harlem is like. Fucking drove all the way up and as you get uptown and things get weirder and Weirder, and this is 90 1990 and it was before they cleaned up times square to it was, it was still kind of a freaky spot and as I'm driving up there, it just started getting crazier and crazier and then all the sudden you're in neighborhoods where you're like, I have to get the fuck out of here.

Speaker 2:          00:22:53       Like this is, this is not safe. Like this dangerous. I was driving through a spot that had garbage that was stacked seven, eight feet high, five feet wide, stacked down blocks. I mean put blocks. There was like long blocks of garbage hills and you're like, what the fuck is going on? Where there's some sort of a garbage strike for, I don't know what the details were, but there was rats running back and forth. You could see him running back and forth. And you know, I grew up in a, like when I lived in Boston, I lived in a suburb in Newton. That's why I went to high school. It was like the calmest, quietest place. It's very nice place. So here I am just a couple of years removed from that and I'm walking down Harlem, watch these rats dart back and forth and people are stepping out of liquor stores holding 40

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       ounces like it's a movie. I'm like, Whoa, this place is crazy. This place is crazy. For 16 from 15 to 22 that was my backyard. Really. My backyard was from a hundred and 13th and fifth which is right by the park to 178 by port authority and Joe Rogan. I had, I knew every nook and cranny like I knew where all the weed was. The coke was, the pills were, the weapons were white and I had, I had been pretty much the, I had been pretty much my mom's best friend lived on 113th and the fifth and that was a horrible by the at night. That turned into something else. And then with it being in the number of state, when I was a kid with my parents were the Cubans have their main numbers thing is by a place called La Marqueta. There's a train and they have all these little markets and it's on a hundred and 18th and a used to be Spanish back in and then the seventies sixties and early eighties and what you do as my mom would have a bodega and she'd have sodas and cigars and maybe books or dreams and people come in and they say, I had a dream about a truck getting hit by a fucking monkey.

Speaker 1:          00:24:55       I Trump this 50 and a monkey's three. So they put $5 on three 50 you know, and $5 pays you $2,500 that night. Cash, no fucking drama. And all the banks would be upstairs. So the Bot, you'd have bodegas all around Harlem, but the bank would be centralized on one building. And the summers I would have, I would have a couple of different jobs in the summers. I would either help them to Bodegas, you know, stocking shelves and running money up the stairs, or I answered the phones and how to yell the numbers to the dude's and they would flip it. So if you get too much action, let's say on 604 after you get $50 on that number, you got to, let's say you get $82 on that number, you have to take $32 and dump it off to a different bank because you could only get killed if you give away $50 that means you're losing $25,000 for the day.

Speaker 1:          00:25:48       So it was always happening. It's a very interesting fucking racket. It's not huge anymore because the picket came in. So the lottery, the one of the biggest lotteries, I don't know if they still do as a Puerto Rican lottery, you buy the sheets, you buy it by the sheets and that's big and that part of the country. But uh, their talent, it was invented by Strap Santo traffic, aren't they? In Miami? And he brought it from Cuba and it's called policy. So then the Italians took it. They were a big thing of it, but the ethnics were where the monies that they're the ones that have the dreams and that poor. So that's what the ethnic took that market from the Mafia. He said how ironic. It's a lottery is coming for the all that money's coming from the poor people playing it. People that have the dream.

Speaker 1:          00:26:34       The next time you go to seven 11 and you go get where you want rolling papers and you're fucking thirsty. Look who's in front of you. Some fucking guy. Huh? Let me get the tech health floor, which you know he's in fucking seven or 11 eh, this fucking Isis substation with a fucking dream. He's going to win the lottery. You know, it's a fucked up dream. I see people in my seven 11 all the time buying 25 30 tickets, but I also, part of it makes me giggle. A lot of it reminds me of being a kid. My mom, my mom's number habit was Harvard hall played the numbers constantly. If she walked in here and you have like, what's the sand Cronk 31 give me the number before 31 Jo, five blank called New York. Five 31 $20 Bam. So anywhere she went and she saw a number that was weird.

Speaker 1:          00:27:20       She blast that motherfucker. The only times I hit the number when I was a kid just fucking around with her. I would have joined like a football team and I would come home and she'd go, what's that number on your shirt? 57 put a number in front of that five. She called the book, five 57, $10 $5,000 for dinner. Another time I hit it on my birthday to 19. I used to hit that motherfucker constantly on my birthday, but that was my mother's fucking main thing was numbers, numbers in Harlem. So I got to walk around there as a child. Then as I got older, my first arrest wasn't home. I got caught smoking weed on 160 first street in 1983. The first day after the Superbowl, I want $800 on the, uh, when the triple, what's the Miami? These, the, the sleeping and the bees, whatever the fuck they were when they beat the Redskins.

Speaker 1:          00:28:09       And I went into a health food store. In those days we'd stores were health food stores in Harlem. So what does the health food store can complain of you who's no protein drinks in those days it was it protein powder, you know, vitamins. And then if you knew the right people, you want to know you're not in the glasses wall bulletproof. Wow. And you went in and they, you'd say, what do you have? Let me get to raise. And they, excuse me, they put the weed and the glass you take and give them the $30 and you'd ask permission can I wrote it in the corner and you rolled the joint in the corner and then you could go outside and smoke it. I wrote it in the corner and when I lit it in the corner, because it was windy, it was January, when I went to put the light into the joint, a fucking mailman put a gun to my head and he goes, get on the floor.

Speaker 1:          00:28:54       He goes, if you got more than 20 singles on you, I'm going to beat the fuck outta here. I got on the floor, I had 800 I had one 800 probably had seven 40 and he goes, what'd you get this money from me and I want some cops started pulling up and they were looking for people who was selling loose joints to kids two blocks away. So when they realized I lived in Jersey and, and I had no idea in those days, I didn't walk with an ID dog. My word was my shit. No idea. In those days I throw away the ID, fucking no idea. You want it, you're a cop. Figure it out the fuck you're fucking conquer or the tactic. Figure it out, bitch. And the cop told me, tell me the truth, your name. I told him the truth. And they put my finger on one of those things.

Speaker 1:          00:29:33       That was the early technology. New York had lake three vans that have that shit on it, fingerprint thing and it came back. Jose Diaz and blast, they let me go. In fact, the cop took wheat out of my bag, put it on the floor and said, now it's nine grams. I you could keep it and I'll give you a ticket. And that was my first legitimate arrest. I got arrested for that in Manhattan. I did six months, the first sentence. And I moved to Colorado and I had to write the guy a letter on the first and call him on the fifth and they let me go. So they looked at your fingerprints and they found your name for the quick quick. And I was never, never been arrested before. Never. So how are your fingerprints in the record? Wouldn't know. Fuck him. I the hospital maybe.

Speaker 1:          00:30:15       I have no idea. I didn't ask no questions. That's interesting. I wonder if everybody's finger, I mean, especially with like apple, like that was one of the big things that people were worried about with the iPhone Raaga already on again. Yeah. That apple thing is fucking up or ready. Well, I'm not even talking about that. I'm just talking about the ability to use your fingerprint because you can get your fingerprint from this. Like as you're pressing it, right? It's, it's leaving your fingerprint and that's how it recognizes your fingerprint. And the idea is that that all goes to a database. You know, we want to know if Joey Diaz touched anything with his finger. Well, let's look at the database. Oh look this, we got his fingerprint. It's right here. Run it. And so they have your fingerprint at my school. They did it in middle school.

Speaker 1:          00:30:52       We all had to clarion thumbprints down on both sides. And it was kind of like we, we learned about thumbprints, prints and we're like, where did that go? You know, we just, I don't remember whether or not I did that, but I probably did it when I was a kid. P A L I was a big PA guy. You weren't sure if you didn't have the police athletic league. You want to shit. Really? Yeah. When I was a kid out of 12 we won. I came from Cuba. There was, they taught you how to play pool. They look fucking listen. They would just regular comps and this was that. This is a job to get away from their wives with the pal. There's a bunch of Puerto Rican kids and I little Irish dirty kids. And what's a great way to make a relationship with the cops today?

Speaker 1:          00:31:30       What Bro? They tonight to fucking the precinct and they let you shoot a gun. They kept, you kept a target. You kept a bullet. They fingerprint that year they took a picture of you and you did. It was, they took us on fucking basketball trips. They took us to the Yankee stadium. I had a great relationship. But then in like the seventh grade, eighth grade, Mr. Moreno, it took us to fucking Detroit for a little bitty basketball tournament and we found some guy in the street that buys a case of beer and it was all a little bit the fucking shot Jack. That mother fucker said, it's over. We're not even playing a game. He drove him was right back home. We didn't get to play a game. We drove debt and get a case of beer and we drove right back for eight hours right back to fucking jersey.

Speaker 1:          00:32:07       So I'm a, I'm a p a l I always was. So maybe that's how they got my fingerprints. Was, was that the end of the relationship with pa out? Uh, no. I think I used to still go for, it wasn't why I grew up in Jersey. The pal or is geared more towards boxing. When I was in New York City, it was a, it was a place that they had like a boxing, they had a pool table, they had a, you know, sodas and shit like that. Activities you may like ceramics and shoe depending on your age. And Jersey. It was more Mr Gameo. Mr Gameo was a Cuban dude. He ran the boxing program and I used to know his two sons, Julio and season. They got me a job at putting on the field and they were like, listen to when you get the job, you got to rob Putnam fields right by Seacaucus off of route three.

Speaker 1:          00:32:53       It's dirty truck. People go in there. Any job. I lasted about three weeks before they fired me, but I left that and after three weeks the guy at night was a half a momo. His name was Freddy, even though it's telling you this, so we robbed the one that we go listen, we're just going on and be Freddy up. We were like sophomores in high school. We'll put mask on me and deedee can Tara and when he comes out, because in Jersey you pay the gas guy, you don't go into a store, you know they pump your gas. So if you robbed the Guy, you basically robbed the joint. Do you follow me? Only Oregon and New Jersey is where the people pump your gas. Everybody else. You walk in with a cart, so we were kids. We were like, let's rob fucked up. Freddy, you know when I worked at, I got to know Freddy Freddy's wife looked like honey boo boos mother, but he was a little guy but he, his wife was like 400 pounds and the only way she would let him fucking as if he brought below home and he was a skinny, tiny guy like Eddie Bravo.

Speaker 1:          00:33:46       She was like three 90 and she would actually put the Bikini and they, they were such white trash. They lived in a studio apartment and they would rent the Jacuzzi and putting the living room. These people were fucking, they lived on the third floor studio did your part, but my God, and it was the worst building in the neighborhood and they had black model. She was the only black girl in the neighborhood, black bottle. I don't know what black Marlowe is today, but she's the Real Martin Luther King. She was the only black girl in a white neighborhood and Jersey thugs. That girl torture. She got tortured. I always loved Black Marlo. Marlo was tight with me. Her mother was white. Something had happened for houses, fucked up. That building was fucked up. So I used to go with it as selling blown. I remember Freddy opening up the door and they were like a robot and his, his fat wife and living with heels with a bikini on and he's like, thank you for bringing it to me.

Speaker 1:          00:34:34       Like he really was like, when you brought them the blow, he was fucking thankful that you fucking like, thank you man. I'm like, we'll see tonight. Like she would not give me my hand job if he didn't have blow. So finally, so finally one day me and Deedee can tell, we decided, let's go down there and rob this motherfucker on a Saturday night. Let's wait until about midnight when he's got a grand on them because you don't drop two, you get 2000 so every 2000 you'll make a drop in the floor safe and you can't get back in there. So me and Dee Dee went behind the building by sea cock and there was right next to this hot dog place, snappy nappies. The rumor was that's what the ice man killed somebody and put them in a tank by snapping that it's, no, this is a real fucking area jersey, this is across the street was one of the biggest strip clubs in the east coast.

Speaker 1:          00:35:19       Not when I was there. Robin. Freddy couple of years after that, like the army base. So you remember if you lived in New York, they called us to the air force base some basis, some shit. But when we were kids we went there like at 12 and we took Freddy down dog. We just tagged with a master like kicking him. Like they kicked the whatever his name is and that Deniro movie in the bar and we took his little person, we ran away and he gets it like it took him a week. He's like, you guys robbed me last night cause we had masks on and shit. We're like Freddy, it wasn't us. He's like, yeah, so was I heard your voices. Then he came back to us. He's like, listen, I'll let you rob be once a month, but you got to split the money with me. So I could buy an eight ball to fuck my wife. So once a month we go down and give a steady Freddy, you're beaten and we kick the fuck out of them.

Speaker 1:          00:36:05       Just I'm pressing let you do it. He wanted to with the cops, you know, that's the only way to cops and we did it like eight times. So rob, did you give him black eyes? Bloody noses. Some of the stomach couple of times that we need them. Neon belly, I don't even know what it was. No video back then either. She had it leave marks on them. Yeah, you have like kick him a few times. I couldn't do it. I had too much of a heart, so I always had a higher, like I had to bring like one of my crazy friends that was having like a bad week. There's a kid in Miami today that everyone, every time I place south Florida, he shows up with his girlfriend and he gets fucked up and he tells a story. When I knocked on his door with a diagram on how we were going to rob Freddy and he goes, that's when I knew that you were fucking for real.

Speaker 1:          00:36:52       He goes, I was eating dinner with my family. You knocked on the door and had a sketch like the deal, how you were going to kick him and run into the weeds and go right to the coke dealers house. Like I had a plan. We had done it so many times, but I had to keep getting different partners because I couldn't hit Freddie. All I could do was tackle them. I was good at tackling them and then we want to go down and have my friend kicked him a few times. It just fucking horrible, but when you're 16 Joe, what the fuck though? You've got to have a good time. You know you're not going to kick study Freddy where you're going to kick Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:37:25       You're so right about the numbers. My grandmother loved. That's big Italian big and this is silly. And then they have dreams and dreams. The vesper came from them in the middle of the night. It's my grandma told him to play six 44. Yup. My grandmother would never not shut the fuck up about it. And then they give you a little note and they fucking, and this is psyllium is almost as bad as the Cubans. The old school, she's silly and are very stupid. Stitious with the eyes. They make those fucking soups with the eye and shit. And I had fucking, I had, I had to seal ends in my neighborhood that I'm still very tight with. I still talk to her a lot, but even the way they spoke Italian schedule like the way they, the ferociousness and they're fucking language cause they got beat up for years. The history assists. Lee's a very fucking sad one, but it's so, uh, you know, there's that expression. Never feel Rome. The snakes lot, the snake lies coiled and a golden nugget. The snake, Laos called and Naples, you know, nobody ever gave Cecily respect that we're like the best fucking child. You know, the kids I grew up with have blonde hair and blue eyes, which really puts in doubt.

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       You know, other people say that the Moore's conquered sizzling and raped them and shit. And we discussed it to the night of the vespers when all the men got up and cut that big off and shit. That's why it's happened. If you look it up on Wikipedia at night of a thousand vespers or something, look it up guys. Let's get this fax right. If a thousand vests, s'mores with torturing the Sicilians in the 1400 tortured and 15 hundreds and they were fucking raping that women. And One night the Sicilians got together and fucking couldn't take it no more. And they got up and I know one night and they killed these mother fuckers, but they cut that Dick's off and shoved them in the fucking mouth. And that's why it Sicilians are very sensitive when it comes to the issue of rape. They can't, they can't because it's in their DNA.

Speaker 3:          00:39:17       Like they can't, they got raped. They got slaughtered. It's an that fucking thing. These Moore's the Moore's or who like crazy black people from Africa that fucking left age. I think they offer map. Yeah. That's from Africa. The Moore's guys we know is the whole premise of that scene and I'm a true romance. The Sicilian vespers, the name given to successful rebellion on the island of Sicily that broke out in the Easter of 1282 against the rule. The French Capetian King Charles the first, yeah, it was wrong. Who had ruled the king of Sicily since 1266 within six weeks, 3000 French men and women were slain by the rebels, the rebels and the government of King Charles lost control of the island. It was the beginning of the war of the Sicilian vespers. Hmm. Like get to go down, but it got people [inaudible]. Once you get to the Moise Sicilian or breast, that's a fucked up country.

Speaker 3:          00:40:07       That's like Cuba. So they fucking sac that belief in the Catholicism religion, but a little more like most people. That's my people. Yeah. No, a little more than most people. They really believe and they put them a Luke on yet and I hope you fucking die. They spit on themselves. You know, my mom couldn't say cancer without spitting on herself. What does, somebody would say cancer. My mom will, I do it all the time now. People talking about cancer, about myself, I spend on myself and so weird. That was my grandmother. My grandmother was so crazy, man. My grandmother went to jail because she wouldn't write out the mom because she was running numbers. My grandmother was running numbers. We, she went to Jeff for six months. We'd always be like, where's grandma? She's with an aunt Annie. Where's grandma? She's with at marine like, why isn't she with Amory?

Speaker 3:          00:40:58       Like doesn't make any sense. Then one day when I was like 20 they told me, Greg, you know, grandma was in jail, right? And I was like, what? She was crazy. She had a monkey named Chichi. The monkey lived in the attic. My grandmother was off the charts crazy. She was very artistic and a Chichi fucking hated everybody except my grandma. My grandma would feed this monkey gum, the gum, the monkey would take a stick of gum, unwrapped the gum. Let me start chewing gum in front of you. The monkey knew that it was gum. It didn't try to eat. It just chewed

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       it like you would chew gum. The monkey would sit there and chew fucking gum. He would eat. He would peel bananas in front of you to be, you have come near him. When he was with her, he will bite your fucking face like no one could come near Cigi she was the only one, so there's like crazy lady had a monkey and her base or in her attic. So we would come over to hang out. My Grandmother, she'd make homemade pasta. They would make homemade sauce from the tomatoes that my grandfather grew, those jersey beef, steak, tomatoes. He always had a garden. My grandfather always had. He always had a big fucking fenced in garden in his back, like he was growing all kinds of things. He would tell you how to grow and he was very meticulous about it. Like he was really invested in this garden and they would take the tomatoes, they would make fresh tomato sauce.

Speaker 2:          00:42:16       My grandmother would make fresh homemade pasta. It was fucking sensational. The food was sensational. My, my grandmother's homemade pasta has a taste that liked to this day I don't, I don't think I've ever experienced it anywhere else before. Cause you can get really good homemade pasta at a restaurant. You can get really good homemade pasta, you know, in a nice place or some, some folks know how to make it. But when you're getting it from someone who's like literally making it in the same way that the, the original immigrants, it's very different than the way Italians make it. The Italians in North America have a very different style of, of food, of cooking with red sauce. You're like, that's not as, that was not as popular in Italy is it wasn't miracle. All this pasta and meatballs, Spaghetti and meatballs, these are American Italian dishes and my grandmother was a master at those.

Speaker 2:          00:43:07       Oh my God. She would make these fucking meatballs. You would walk in the house and they'd be cooking. You'd hear the crackling and the you like, good fucking Lord. She would cook them on a frying Pan, just get these motherfuckers perfect and crackling and then she would cook them in the sauce for hours, had sausage, blip, blip, blip, just simmering for hours. She would check it, stick a wooden spoon near him, put that fucking live right back on and walk away. She knew when it was done and you would have this fucking Italian food. It was just so ridiculous, so ridiculous, but it's, they've been Americanized, but if you go to some homes I got, there was a hole in my neighborhood who were very nice people and the grandmother always cooked and her dishes were never red sauce. There were always based with pasta with beans, which I love.

Speaker 2:          00:43:57       I love teaching pasta. I love Pasta for Zul at Spanish. Lissa, there's no better mail for you as a health thing. I don't give a fuck. 'Em some people say Pasta, a zoo and some fast because they would go to olive garden. But what is the right way to say, oh no, I don't know because my credit, my family always said [inaudible] foster for a zoo. But what is positive as Jolie? That's the same thing. You don't know how it breaks it a dialect. It's got that stuff and it's not spinach. If something else is there, the different dishes. Uh, I'm not, it's the same dish. Gyro, Euro. Honestly, I think it's everybody

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       has it. You know, somebody possibles rule is completely different than if you go to whole foods. It's completely different than when I go to my friends and jerseys. It's a thicker stock. It's got the spinach with uh, with the beans and the little fucking pastas in it and they freeze it. And that's where the strength comes in. It's like get stronger and stronger and that garlic, and in the winter that's what they offer you. But that's port map. See, Italians were very poor, so all the dishes are based around really potato beans and pasta and bread and bread. Bread was big. My grandfather used to go to this bread store that was a bakery that was down the block. We would walk down the block on North Ninth Street. We'd go about two blocks down and we walk into this old school Italian bakery that, you know, it's since 1926 I'm shelling the on the, on the sign and you would get basically the same kind of bread every day.

Speaker 1:          00:45:24       And it's sensational. Had fucking real Italian bread from New York, New Jersey, like that area from the immigrants. Holy Shit was that good. And he wasn't just get bread brown cross got that motherfucker with a serrated knife and it's just so, it's just delicious. Like you don't get bread like that out here for some reason. And if it was a good day to motherfuck was making separately, oh what kind of them in the bag would leak on the sugar and on the way home you'll be inhaling bread and fucking Zappa. Lee's and nobody gained a pound. Nobody was allergic to gluten. It was not people rub example is on their fucking faces cause I was one of them. Let me tell you what, what meal I discovered like at 12 and the Italian house. Fucking Cannoli, because from Hoboken Karma, mine would go to Hoboken and pick up, I know he's a guy would only make 16 of them on Fridays.

Speaker 1:          00:46:14       So you had an older guy. He only gave me for that type of shit. Like that family. It was that type of shit. Hoboken's very Italian. What happened to Hoboken was like anywhere else and we don't want to live in Hoboken no more. We're going to move to, you know, Jersey City. So all those areas got to taste the whole booklet. But all of that northern New Jersey Shit, that's all whole boat. And at the end of the fucking day, those are years and years of Italians that were in Hoboken, you know, working on the trains and all that shit. You know, Hoboken, when we, if you ever saw Hoboken in the eighties it was a fucking die. You would go to fourth street, all that shit. You get mugged on it. They were fucking around when Bob Dubois and all those guys are Mondo a rebus. We're running fucking basketball down there.

Speaker 1:          00:46:55       You went. I used to take a bus to Hoboken to play basketball and pro. You had a guard that fucking ball. You gotta Watch your hooded sweatshirt. They would jack your shit though. But I knew the benders down there and I used to go down and I used to go to a place down there that had that bread the point, because it's not round that that's the shit you see now. I see it. At times it would get round. Loves to, Oh my God, at the top of the witch's hat, take that mother fuck off and put a, put a piece of hotel Bob Butler in that mother fucker and let it come out. Good googling you. Feel your heartbeat now. And this is appellee's now that you'll never see that again. I think that there's still parts of the city and somebody, one of those guys, I think Anthony Bordain went to Brooklyn a few weeks ago and he went to one of those places that had Zappa. He's somebody.

Speaker 2:          00:47:44       It Bordain went into this one. There's like a, an Italian Deli that serves lunch. They'll serve like pasta with red sauce and a meatball and the place has been under the same family's ownership since the 18 hundreds some crazy like that. And this guy who was running it was a little boy. He's a, he's an old man. He was a little boy when he started working there and so Bordain she's showing these pictures of him and he's old school, black and white pictures of him in this place and now hearing is running it. It's crazy. Like those, that's like a direct connection to the people that came over on those boats. That's, that's wild shit man. I don't think about it too much, but when I do, my grandparents were both born in other countries. They were both born in Italy and my grandfather on my father's side, I was born in Ireland.

Speaker 2:          00:48:31       My grandmother on my father's side was born in Italy. They were all immigrants, all of them. They all came over in a wave and the twenties and thirties and they survived the fucking great depression dev or a different kind of human being. There are different kinds of human beings then we are today so much show the, the metamorphosis of the human race from the time that people came over on boats to what we are today. It's, it's bananas. I mean it's, it's almost like one of the biggest leaps of, of like, of like a culture changing. I'm going to wrap it away like the human beings have today in comparison to the human beings have, you know, naming to [inaudible] number a hundred years ago, you know, cause my grandparents, it's basically almost a hundred years before they came over here. It's crazy. That's a crazy world. They lived in Joey, they didn't even have a video of what the United States look like. And they had the balls to get in the boat with kids and come across the ocean.

Speaker 1:          00:49:31       No, it was supposed to be a better life. And it was, you know, people don't know is an episode of Sopranos when he explains how, uh, they all came to a neighborhood, remember there's a beautiful episode. And he goes, oh, when they tried to buy the eggs member, they tried to buy the store where they had eggs on the corner. And he goes, let me tell you something. He goes, we came here, my family came in 80 years ago and we all moved to a neighborhood. That's what families did show all the Rogan's would live on third, every Rogan cousin, you know, they weren't all Rogan's, uh, whatever. They are regular on all those. They will all know my, my grandfather's name was rogue, rogue. And so they all moved into an area. And then when they got, when he said that goes down, they went up to get the Gulch. He goes and they all went to Broomfield and he goes, you know, is the only place in the neighborhood that you could still go and get chicken eggs, not those fucking supermarket eggs. He goes, I can't sell it ticket. And it, and it was all those neighbors, whether it's whole book and uh, Brooklyn get

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       all those Canarsie, those Italian people came over, they live nine to one apartment, you know, and you know, what really saddens you that those people that came over and never got to see the fruits of their labor, they never got to see what their great grandson did or what do you know what I'm saying? Like in a way, yeah, but they did. I mean, I think they got to see the world change. You know, anybody that came over from the 1920s and went through World War II, you've got to see some goddamn crazy changing the world. You know? And I think back then to a greater sense that the good guys won. You know, right now the lines kind of blurry the United States back in the 1940s after we won World War Two and it was over and they ha, they show people like kissing in the streets.

Speaker 2:          00:51:11       You're not going to see that shit again. That's, we don't have the same enthusiasm about wars. They did that because back then they really thought there was good guys and bad guys. It was real simple. There was Nazis back then. There was kamikaze is back then. It was crazy method up. Japanese dudes were flying planes into fucking boats. They attacked Pearl Harbor. They get, they didn't give a fuck. This was a dangerous time. So when the, when the, when Japan won, when Japan signed and after they bombed Hiroshima, Nagasaki, when they eliminated those fucking cities and Japan signed the trust agreement or whatever the fuck it was, that was everybody was, it was over. Like we had one, like people were happy as fuck back then. So they went through that, which is a pretty crazy time. They went from the time of no movies to movies.

Speaker 2:          00:51:59       That's a crazy time. They went to see movies. They like one of the first, well their generation was the first have televisions. Like he saw TV for the first time when there was no TV before them. No one had ever had TV before. When people return home from World War Two where they treated the way when people came back from Vietnam? No, I told him he would spit on totally your fucking baby killer and all that shit. That fucking stinks. Start when was it fucking good to go to the airport after a war and spit at people went over there. You have a fucking opinion about somebody who went over there and actually put his life up, whether he knew what not. What the fuck is going on in your 18 fucking years old? I think when World War Two didn't they take give you a dirty fucking five minutes.

Speaker 2:          00:52:39       Give a fuck. Right. A World War One. I think those fucking whores, I don't know if anybody really did spit on anybody in calm baby killers. They did some and deserves all the hippies and all that shit. There was a, that was a part of the thing that someone refuted about the Chris Kyle Story Cause Chris Kyle said that that happened to him. Someone calling him a baby killer and he was saying that this is all like what he's doing. He's repeating something that someone else had. Man, I need to look into it more. But for sure they were treated like a lot of people thought the Vietnam War was a bad idea. They didn't think it was the same as the way they thought of World War II, World War II. It was like a war that everybody kind of agreed how to happen. There was a crazy guy in Germany that was taken over the world and he was killing Jews.

Speaker 2:          00:53:20       He killed millions of fucking people. Then there was a Japanese, they were in on it together. Somehow mean didn't even make any sense. They don't even speak the same language. They're in cahoots. So it was the Japanese and then there was the fucking Americans and the Russians were involved and like fucking Christ. So when that was over, those people would experience some gigantic change. They felt like, probably made sense that they came over here. They came over to the baddest fucking team ever, you know, and everybody was like a part of it. When when you see that celebration, everybody's kissing in the streets and everything after the Japanese surrendered. That's a, that's a powerful, iconic slice of like that embodies like what that time meant to a lot of people. That shit doesn't happen now. So they, I think they experienced a lot of pretty cool shit.

Speaker 2:          00:54:05       They experienced a lot of God damn change and the what we're living right now, I mean there's an amazing as this world is right now, if we keep going at the same rate, I think a hundred years from now people are going to look back at this time. I go, look at these silly fucks. God Damn, these people were suffering that he's still got colds. You know, they still had to worry about losing weight. They still had to worry about, you know, getting enough sleep. Like they were worried about their health. Like these poor fuckers, if they got the flu, they had to stay home. Like this is going to be some shit a hundred years from now. It's going to just fix everything. Anytime anything's wrong. There's not going to be, there's not going to be more health concerns. Our concern is going to be making sure that we don't have too many people on the earth.

Speaker 2:          00:54:44       That's going to be our number one concern in like a hundred years, but it's the things that we look at now and we think, God, I couldn't imagine living like they lived in 1920s fuck that little stupid ass TV. The little tiny as black and white TV. That was the size of a laptop and it was in a cabinet that looked like a fucking gun safe. You remember those stupid things? Giant ass cabinets with his little stupid screen that was black and white and a record player on top and it would lift the whole thing. We'll lift up on top and he had all the speakers on the TV in the middle with the controls over here that you had to lift up and over here was directed play, so we had a switch TV to stereo and then the speakers were over here and they both came and Jesus.

Speaker 2:          00:55:28       Those things are cool. That's what I watched superman on for my first time as a kid. I remember watching it on TV on one of those, I watch a lot of fucking Yankee Games and my grandfather's and you don't do it, dude. When the TV would go bad, they'd put a smaller TV on top of it. They didn't want to get rid of the cabinet, so cause the cabinet, it was so nice and then TV started becoming smaller. They became like a plastic box, like a shitty kind of plastic box. I take that shitty plastic box, put it right on top of the other fucking teeth like everybody did that. Everybody had a TV on top of the broken TV. My mom put a TV on top of [inaudible]. She could see the mets and the Yankees at the same time. That's how my mom does that. Cuba, they loved that baseball, she loved the beds, put sewer love like what we was playing the Yankees or whatever. So she was the original sports bar at the house, at your house, but she was the original sport where you go to a sports bar, you're overwhelmed by the amount of different games that are going on at once,

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       but that will show, remember the fights I saw at a bar like at her bar I saw it was, I got an education that I don't remember. Lot of those fights even have to tell me, but I saw all the great fights that were on ABC sports center at that bar. When they fight in the afternoons, four 30 in the afternoons on Saturday, I still remember this is how fucking old guy am I did a scam for with these Jews with side learns, his fucking Jew in Jersey where he, for years he used to bug me. Listen, if you ever need any money, we exclude somebody and when he would do is in the daytime, he'd go around and look for holes and then consistency in supermarkets and shit and he set up the whole thing for you. All you have to do is fall.

Speaker 4:          00:57:12       God, it's so crazy. The

Speaker 1:          00:57:14       guy was a genius. They paid them, the major colleges and some pro football teams paid him and he would fly out and scout other teams. That's how much of a genius he was. He was, he was, what do you call those people are not dunks. And he always says those people, they're good at. They're only good at one thing. Idiot savant. He would, I mean, he was missing a tooth. His shorts had piano. He looked in a garage. Okay, because every dollar he spent was it the generate gamma. Oh, but that's, that's what he did. He went around in the daytime looking for holes and shit, and he's like, wait, what do you want? What do you need? Plenty. Geez, I'll make it 20 it. When we go to the supermarket, I don't knock over the apple sauce. You fall down and stayed down to like give you the nod.

Speaker 1:          00:57:56       Right? You start yelling and screaming. Then you pass out. And when the lady comes over, he had the whole scan. The next day he picked you up. He took it to the attorney's office. He took it to the hospital, he took it to the chiropractor's office. He took it to everywhere you had a beat. And his philosophy is he got you with as many doctors as he could. You got to quit your job, you got to quit your day job because all he did was make appointments for you and everybody was in on the scan. So when his world, the more the higher your doctor bills, you got 10 times that Shaviah doctor bills are like fucking or something like that. If your doctor bills were half a million, he could get you a hundred thousand 200,000 you know, like if you lost a finger, he had the home menu or you need 60,000 give me a finger, you know, fuck it.

Speaker 1:          00:58:39       Let's lose a finger on the top and shit like that. He was that crazy. Wow. So I had to go to a chiropractor and he tells me that's how he sold it. You want to make money, you got to punch in. So you've got to go to all those doctors every day and take the treatment. And the doctors have to give you the treatment even though they know it's a scam, they're rent on it. So that I remember going to the chiropractor, he would put those laser beams on me, those pads and my back and just walk out of the room and then come back. But I went up there the day, boom. Mcne killed the Korean guy. It was on wide world of sports. I'm a Saturday afternoon and I had none of that. It was like time stopped.

Speaker 1:          00:59:19       Like the phone was ringing at the chiropractor's office and nobody was Hansard. That's how much of an intense fight this was. Like the people came out from behind the counter and it was on regular TV. I think Fox had just come in. Fox wasn't still around. I don't think it was around, you know, there was like ABC wide world of sports, 83 83 one year to Fox come around. It was when I was in high school. So that was in high school. They had a, the Simpsons and America's most wanted, so 88 86 no shit. I was out of high school.

Speaker 2:          00:59:51       Wow. So it must've been when I was still living at home. This, I remember the Simpsons. I mean that was when it didn't Fox start with the Simpsons, the Tracey Ullman show. When did the Simpsons since 1989, Tracy, all men had the Simpsons are in it. It was, uh, like really horrible animation in the Tracey Ullman show. Remember the Simpsons looked all weird and they all look messed up and I don't really remember my, that, my memory of that. It's foggy shit. But I do remember watching those fights on ABC wide world of sports. You know, they had a, NBC had boxing on a Friday night, recently pit world champion or maybe Saturday, but a Adrian Broner versus a John Molina. And then they had, um, what's the other fight? Uh, Keith Thurman Versus um, Robert Carrera, good fights, but they went the distance. Bolton, what the distance when you watching boxing on regular TV? It feels weird. I was like, Whoa, it's box on TV again. Like it's been off of regular TV for a long ass time.

Speaker 1:          01:00:54       I think that, uh, that's one show they should bring back. I think that was my first discovery channel was wild world of sports. That was one of the most interesting shows when I was growing up because you didn't know what you were going to watch. Sometimes I don't think wide world of sports with lasted a bar that I like or even then because every once in a while they to have like ballet from China. Hong Kong people go ape shit. I still remember watching Arron banks, uh, karate championships. I'm wild world of sports as a kid. I used to go to the garden to watch this. Uh, but uh, his big closer was the guy who they put a mirror in front of and they'd shoot at them when they're 22 and he'd put a mouthpiece in his mouth and he catched the bullet. Come on you guys.

Speaker 1:          01:01:39       The guys doing the trick though, right? I listen. I'd love to fucking tell you know, I think I'm pretty sure that's a fucking jerk. He catches it and then he spits the bullet on the frying pan and smoke comes out of the fucking bullet. I don't know. You know, but that was his main thing. It's some sort of, how do you practice? I mean that, that was what I always wanted to know. What the fuck do they have a practice here? Eat Bullets. Who's going to let you come over and you shoot. I don't want to 22 it's taught by throwing grapes in his mouth. Are you fucking crazy? A great bit of bullets. Two different bodies. But you got to start slow. Oh my God. That's how I used to figure it out. Nobody could just just do it one time. You got to practice that shit and

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       tell the timing and fucking Pam and no to twist. And that's a carny trick. And if they did do it, there's gotta be some bodies involved. Like we got to do a documentary on them, whoever the bodies of the people tried to catch bullets with their teeth. Like let's not try the shotgun this time. It's just try regular gun or a BB gun or something. Well they definitely have killed people accidentally and those like stupid like magic tricks, stunts. It's definitely happened. It's definitely happened. I know I've read it. I've read stories about people dying doing crazy magic experiments. When you try to like really push the limits, you got a lot of variables involved. One could go wrong. Next thing you know you're fake gun. Like, like when Brandon lead died, he died on a set of a movie in a special effects scene.

Speaker 3:          01:03:05       They shot him with a, a fake gun, a gun with blanks. But there was some piece of a shell or something that was still in the chamber, that gun and that shot into him. You know, that was what the triads got them. Do you think so? You really do. You know those people, that Sicilian dog. Listen, you don't want, I'm going to kill you and your fucking son. They did it. That's what it is. Cause I had heard that he died, that Bruce Lee died from some sort of an allergic reaction to a drug or listen, he, he was doing, he did three or four movies with these fucking have fucking salesman. They invested $6,000 and they fucking went to the bank and said they made millions. Nobody knows how much enter the Dragon, man. Nobody knows it's 42 years and correct. 80 90 it's 42 years and see what that made worldwide the first week.

Speaker 3:          01:03:56       You know what I mean? Fucking copies. Enter the dragon are not there. That's Raymond Chow after fucking Raymond chowder the business with the studios. Amen. Enter the Dragon. I don't know if he, it was Raymond Chow, the other guy, sterling silhouette or one of those fucking guys. After Bruce Lee die, there's a Raymond child really fucking blew up and he was a heroin fucking guy through him. He ended up, he ended up, what are your own child? Child stood. What was the name of Ron? Ron Chow. Run one child studios. They ended up doing Charles Bronson movies and Clint Eastwood Movies and Shit. They gave him a color. The action somewhere. Another. Wow. This is a, this is crazy. It says he died from a cerebral edema. Right? Some Chinese guy could tell you anything. Listen, my father died of a cocaine, heroin overdose of heroin overdose. They told me he died of a heart attack and then never signed the death certificate.

Speaker 3:          01:04:43       Where's that doctor today? I guarantee you got hit by a bus two weeks fucking later after they signed that cerebral Herbert told, but that guy died two weeks later and a fucking building fire. He could go out of the fucking elevator. This is what it says here, Ron, at the time, I mean obviously when someone's writing something in Wikipedia, decades after the fact, who knows? Who knows how much they went to some chicks house off the bat, he was adultery. They paid that chick to bring them over and that's what they fucking whacked them. It says around the time of Lee's death, numerous rumors appeared in the media at least iconic status and unlikely demise fed many wild rumors and theories. These include murder involving the triads and it's opposed as a curse on him and his family. That's all I tell you. What the fuck we can get used.

Speaker 3:          01:05:28       Electrical muscular stimulation that may have exacerbated or resulted in his condition. That doesn't make any sense. So what they're saying is his conclusion. David, a tier a forensic scientist, uh, recommended by Scotland Yard who'd overseeing a thousand autopsies was assigned to the case. His conclusion was death by misadventure caused by an acute cerebral edema to a reaction, uh, to compounds present in the combination medication equip Jessic. I don't know what that shit is. Pain relieved rule for a headache or something like that. So all this side kicks he took to the fucking head and all the aspirins, he took an China. It never affected them until that fucking night when he went to madame choose fucking house. I mean, he died with his Stan because he was actually in bed with her. He was in her bed. I mean, a bunch of stories change to make them look bad at the end when he left, uh, those people that do enter the dragon, he pissed off a lot of people.

Speaker 3:          01:06:22       Man. He was making them a lot of fucking money. Well, you know what? Apparently he was already having seizures. There was a doctor, a neurosurgeon who treated a Bruce Lee during his first seizure in May of 1973 he was eating hash to fucking come down from the pain. He was one of the first people that figured out that has sheets was what's, what's Advil when you'd take it? What's Advil? Ibuprofen. What's the really duty beside killed playing? What's, see, it's called a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory hash is and anti inflammatory. That is marijuana. So Bruce Lee figured it out first. Bruce Lee used to eat hash after fucking working out to, to reduce the thing. He would've died a long fucking, he was brain wouldn't swallow. Long time ago that guy died and the height guys, nobody right now. Right now there's not too many people to remember the day he died.

Speaker 3:          01:07:12       I've been first role and nobody even heard the day he died because news didn't travel that fast. There was no internet. We got it like two days later that he died. And I remember half of Americans walking around fucking wounded and that was one of those people. And I didn't believe it because he was fucking healthy shit. He was flying through the air. He was making it fucking happened, but he went back to China and God knows what they did to him over that dog, and we'll never know. Here's a, a preliminary appearance. This is really interesting of doctor preliminary opinion of Doctor Peter Woo. The neurosurgeon who treated lead during his first seizure was that the cause of death should have been attributed to either a reaction to cannabis or equal just sick cannabis like his fucking this is that, you know, it's bullshit. His doctor is telling them that it might've been, we'd very potent Nepali Hash Killed Bruce Lee.

Speaker 3:          01:08:01       He was a Hashtag [inaudible] he discovered it first. Listen, they used to be cookies at Kush mark that whatever you wait, whatever you weight during the week was good. But when he used to have these cookies that were oatmeal in fuse would hash shore. And guys, that was when I first started my diet, when I was 418 pounds and I couldn't walk how sore and my ankles and I would eat two of those hash cookies and the next day my ankles would be like a fucking pick the fucking hash with reduce everything. I wouldn't even feel it bent over rows. Nothing. My Back Hash is the best. It's amazing. And he was fucked up Joey. Okay. This is a, this is a fact, he had a ruptured disc in his back that someone had given them. Yeah. But this is one of the reasons why he was taking all kinds of different shit to try to deal with the uh, with the pain.

Speaker 3:          01:08:49       And He'd already had seizures. So he had seizures. He had a ruptured disc in his back and he was getting medicated. Wayne, the seizure they talking about is the shit. They tried to throw it into the dryer and the biography about him cause he would go away. Like he would go away, like he would go away and get up to say Jo Jo Jo, oh sorry. But the doctor said it's saying seizure. It says neurosurgeon treated him for his first seizure. It's the same guy that says that pot might've killed them too though I don't believe nothing and I love Chinese people and I loved the theories and stuff. You just think they killed him, Huh? They killed him. They killed that. Chuck Norris said that his death was a reaction between the muscle relaxant medication that had been taken since 1968 for rupture disc, so he was taking that the ruptured disc shit for a long time because he died in [inaudible] 73 he's still alive, but he's not getting kicked in the head either.

Speaker 3:          01:09:45       He switches. How many times do you think he fell downstairs? Come on Joe Rogan. How many times you think Keith Richards fell on the thing? You think you look like that? Because he seems like the type of dude that would be able to figure it out correctly. This fucking guy went into, listen, Joe Rogan, when you fucking with that type of environment, you fuck with them. You could kill their mother and they don't give a fuck when you hit their pocket. They don't deal with that shit. They Chinese listen, the mafia concept was stolen from the triads. There's still, they're the smartest guys in the world. They still, they're probably at war with the government from who's bringing the heroin and they brought heroin in. Fee is not one DEA case, not one da case. And go talking mole lane for heroin as ever been caught on us from with genius geniuses.

Speaker 3:          01:10:29       They pay everybody. These guys, when it comes to that paper, they don't fuck around. In 1985, they got sick and tired of giving the mafia pounds a hand on a for $50,000. The Mafia was cut at 10 times making a half a million and a $50,000 investment. They got sick and tired. The Chinese go to go to fucking go to fucking, uh, uh, whatever. Now see how small little Italy is. Who Do you think it took him from? The Chinese. They don't fuck around dog. They don't fuck around that. I don't like that. That's still out there. There's motherfucker when you go to Wyoming, why is there a Chinese restaurant that you think Chinese people like Wyoming, all this state after the fucking hat, the railroads, and then they got cutting on the fucking heroin through it. I think that everyone

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       gets to Wyoming. So fucking white people and envelopes. Fuck, no, it's those Chinese people. I don't really believe that that's a joke. But uh, I, I, when I was a kid, I heard a lot of stuff about the Chinese. I don't want, I don't like to believe crazy conspiracy theories, but if I was going to believe anyone, I would believe that the Chinese mob would kill you if you somehow or another fuck the amount of money. I mean, that's, that's one that seems like, let's go. All right. They made him famous too, right? I mean, he wasn't famous for, for those movies. He was famous dog. By the time he hit Chinese connection, I still remember the two hand punch. The two hand punching the school was down the fucking commercial. We're watching happy days. Bitch was sitting around 20 fucking Puerto Rican kids wear robes on at a Catholic school, pajamas on and ready to go to bed and awesome.

It was the voice before this voice and he was a little mean. I got type of guy say then play the children's hours, but I still remember the best trail of all time is the French connection. Why they're shooting him in the bath as he's going up to train and gene Hackman goes freeze. It's pop by and shoots him in the back of me and they locked it and it said filmed in New York where it happened. Look at the fucking look. A trailer for Chinese collection is shit. [inaudible].

America has to put these four on and realize why stop [inaudible] I'm Bruce Lee changed my life. You only saw one fucking movie. You got to see all four. Forget the game of debt with Kareem Abdul Jabbar. That's a harvest show. Just watch this one. Look at this. That's what he does when he me out. It's just one of the fight starts looking at him dog. He had like 6% body fat at this time. This guy wasn't gonna die. Joe Rogan. People like this don't die. Don't fucking insult me. He didn't die. They killed this poor little kid. But this is really fascinating. I've never seen a movie that I recall were two guys warmed up like this before a fight. But that's, but this is fascinating how they just don't even look at each other. They move away. They go in their own little fucking world for awhile and they meet in the center like these are, this is a different thing than a fight in a movie. You know

Speaker 3:          01:17:56       I, this is two guys agreeing. We have to find out who's the baddest mother fucker alive. You know, they agree to do it the right way. Everybody warms up. Bruce Lee catches a good sweat, so it was chuck. This is crazy shit man. I forgot how crazy this is a, this is the beginning guys. Well, Joe and I talked about the movies in 1973 you really want to watch this shit today. Go ahead. But this is where it starts. This is where all these movies are stolen from and they can't even steal them. They don't know why they even did this. Okay? Bruce Lee is getting into his fighting stance. You're the cap. Bam, Bam, Bam.

Speaker 8:          01:18:32       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:18:32       The bolts were on front leg roundhouse kicks to open up with in front leg sidekicks.

Speaker 8:          01:18:38       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:18:39       No one's hit anybody that block and everything. Oh, Chuck Norris scores or the wheel kick to the face and smiles. He doesn't even follow up. He said, gentlemen, no ground and pound, right. Oh Shit. Chuck is putting a beating on him. Oh my goodness. Oh, Bruce Lee grabbed the god damn chest hair. It's not fair. It's rude is this is also the beginning of tank pseudo when chuck Norris split from tank taekwondo and he could recreate this shit. Really? Yeah. He's a tank pseudo guy. Yeah, but he, I don't think he created, well supposedly he had his, his style. I mean it was definitely a style, but it existed before, so they did two different tanks who dose, right. This tank Sudo Su bog doll and I think he went the other way. There's a superbug Dole that they all, they all started together but he went the other way.

Speaker 3:          01:19:24       Yeah. Tanks. You don't have a little bit of grappling in it. Yes. They had more grappling it then talk to doe did they had like some risks, locks and joint locks and stuff. Hey, we go. So he gets his timing. He starts fucking jumping up and down and it's all fucking lights out motherfucker. But the beauty of this is, this is going to remind you something, Joe, just keep watching watching. Oh Shit. Isn't it dishonorable to grab some of these chest hair and Rick and off them though when you were in the Colosseum, whatever happens happens in this family. You're trying to, as long as you don't lie, but watch all these, watch all this is still slow mall. Nobody knows nothing. Why? Hold on. Hold up. How fake is this role of calcium? They're finding and look, I'll thinking that brick wall was behind them. They keep showing like a picture of the Coliseum and then a brick wall. This is crazy shit. Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee, they slow everything down. This is hilarious. The sound that it makes every time they throw kicks this hilarious too.

Speaker 8:          01:20:36       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:20:40       it's 40 years ago. Look at the camera work. The guys trying Matt. He's like, kick the fucking camera. He's trying. He wanted us out poster of the Roman Colosseum mine poster. They probably shut this in. Laurel Canyon. Laurel Canyon.

Speaker 8:          01:20:55       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:20:55       Chuck Norris is wash his feet. He kicks him in the face. Oh Chuck. Oh, hands down. Damn. Damn. What? Wow. To Chuck. Just shook it off. Beautiful Hair back then.

Speaker 8:          01:21:11       Okay. Hi.

Speaker 3:          01:21:13       Oh, the oblique kick. Look at John Jones style son Bruce Lee was the first oh front leg round cake to the face. Chuck Norris goes down, don't it? Nobody's ever seen anything like this before. Back then, this didn't exist. Never saw a fight and moved to 11 and Tonya head almost blew up. You left. They're looking for some, you'll say something to you, Oh fuck them up. Including your dad. You didn't give a fuck when you left these movies.

Speaker 8:          01:21:43       Joe Rogan,

Speaker 3:          01:21:44       you know whether or not Bruce Lee ever competed. You know, I mean, that was like, the big thing about him is that he never fought like Chuck Norris was like world middleweight kickboxing champion. At one point in time. Bruce Lee definitely did a lot of spark for sure. There's no way it give you this good. The way his timing in his movement, his understanding of what would and wouldn't work like these in a lot of ways, even though some of it is ridiculous, some of his movements are more realistic than shit you see in the movies today. The way he checks with that old bleak kick. The weight counters when you're moving in, it's very realistic. Like these scenes like the way he's fucking, this dude up is a lot like the way someone who's at a really high levels fucking somebody up in the UFC. It's really a kind of ironic, like the way he's the shit that he's doing. What he does. No Bow. That's a move and a half. I told you in the 70s everybody swept Joe Rogan. Everybody. You had a watch that front leg you will get the sweat. Once you got into range and you can two punches laid out that you will get swept dog. Everybody sweat.

Speaker 3:          01:22:48       The sweep has disappeared from our society. He broke his thought. Oh, he broke his leg. There you go. What the fuck you think it dealing with farmers leg zoos arm is it? That's how my hand when I was out of the eight balls, that's how he did. He broke his arm and his legs. Legs fucked up. He fucked them up. He's trying to listen. Watch. This is a tremendous movie. This is tremendous. Guys. Next time you see Chuck Norris dump looking dumb with the wig. Think about this. Think about this move. Look dog. He gets up even though if it's a movie. Bruce was very smart. He goes, let this fucking guy out. It's a great scene though. It can't stand, but he gets up. This was a good fucking scene. He gets up. This is tremendous guys at him. Look at him. He's trying to throw kicks. Can't get up. I forget how it ends. Does it? He kill him. Just boil alert. Beautiful. It's a beautiful ending. Even got up correctly with the fucking damaged leg. The cat. Oh yeah. Mother fuckers. This is cinematography one on one. It you gotta make good team.

Speaker 3:          01:24:15       Oh my God. He killed him. The gets him first time ever. He's upset that he had to kill him. Dove might've been the first guillotine ever in a movie, I believe. Backing up a second, I believe that was an arm in good team, which is particularly difficult to pull up. I don't think, uh, I don't agree with his technique here. Let me say back it up. Just so hair. Is that a arm in?

Speaker 8:          01:24:39       Let's see here.

Speaker 3:          01:24:40       Can't see his other arm. I feel like that's a arm and gaiety in which I call bullshit. No, it's not our men isn't it? Looks like it is. It's hard to finish that one, man. You've got to get up high on the neck or you got to have an unbelievable squeeze. Let's see. What do you get? Nope. I don't know. Tough to tell where his arm was. It was if Chuck Norris had the under Hook there. It's very hard to, well, why don't turn it off. Watch what he does. This is, this is, this is tremendous guys, which he was a fucking soldier and he wrote all these, you know, he wrote all of these though. Look, watch, watch.

Speaker 3:          01:25:20       Oh, the music plays. Dusts off his Kung Fu Dragon. By the way, how many black guys dressed like that? I turned 1970s and eighties has a full outfit. My mom was gonna send me back the Cuba. They sent me to the Santa Maria praise and didn't know what was wrong with me. Here we go guys. No, no, no, no, no. What happened there? Just a youtube comment at the home and he goes and gets his g and puts it on the back of my car like is he back on top of that his belt and makes it look nice for him. Very nice group. That's the guys. Come on. Do you think that this is garbage? This is not good. This is not good. This is garbage, don't you? How dare you? You know what? Pull up the trailer to hard times. Pull up the trailer. Heart

Speaker 7:          01:26:04       team 73 watching trail was. Then we'll go to the mechanic. Watch the trailer. You got to see the trailers to the good, the bad, the ugly, all those movies. It was a different type of editing. It was a different type of cut. Very impressive. Fuck man. It was a different world back then, man. A different world, a lot more believable back then. Charles Bronson. James, why does it say Charles prostanoids chair

Speaker 9:          01:26:37       pick up the money's made on? What does it feel like to knock somebody down? It makes me feel a hell of a lot better than it does him.

Speaker 7:          01:26:50       1933 America had hit the skids. People were out of work. Wow, I'm out of luck. Third refill cost. Life was as tough as a cheap steak was hard at the time. I got a husband in jail. No job and no prospects. A man had to live by his wits. Know he was when they made this movie, good would have gets long odds. What kind of ads you talking to? Five to one d deal by his fists. Columbia. There's an old dude, great shape. That was dude that he fights. It was a gas station attendant. I get enough across from paramount. He got that. He got that in the longest yard. Really soft and hit hard. James Coburn as speed born con man, 50 50 and I'll scratch best and expenses. Oh side bets. I keep 75% who could make a fortune and a day I propose a toast to the best man. I know. Meat and flat broke. I need some money fast. You don't want no trouble. Just you pay your debts. Spi was the hustler broke his car or the sledgehammer. When you change about that shame was the her. You ever get scared when you do live together? They just couldn't be beat. You give us their money. Now that money take, you want to see another Charles Bronson, James Colver, Jill ironman and Strother Martin. There are knockout in hard times. God Damn we punch has the exact same sound effect. Every punches.

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       It's such a weird artificial sound like why didn't they like have someone actually punt then and like get the sound from that. Then somebody wants make that sound and then everyone just accepted that so because why wouldn't you just sit there and just go like that instead? Well, you know they have those Foley artists, those guys that make sound for movies and they just decided on a sound. It's like would clap and together or something like that. No, you want to see a real trailer. Let me show you a real train trailer. This is what took trailers to the next level. Scheft please see all Hunky Dory music shaft took it to the next level of shaft. Woke you up in the movie theater with that Funky Guitar. I remember this one would be, yes, this, there was a, they did a documentary on John Fitch and it was a really good documentary.

Speaker 2:          01:29:49       Hold on, sorry. And but one part of it was like, it was all about the gritty real life of a contender. A guy like fighting GSP for the title. But when they showed some of the fight footage, they had sound effects over the punches. It was like, Shh, shh. And I was like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. What are you doing? Like you guys have like the realest Shit on earth. You're showing guys fighting in a cage and you're having sound effects over over punches. I don't know if they kept it in. I didn't get it. See it again. I only saw like it was, I think it's called such great heights. It's a documentary. They made a way back. Um, what year was that? I was right up to the fight. The GSP. Yeah, they shot the documentary with him beating GSP. They thought he was going to be cheap.

Speaker 2:          01:30:32       My page GSP. So that was, it was good. I watched your documentary but I mean I don't think they've shot it. Thinking he was going to beat him. Did they deserve, they shot it hoping he was going to beat him, but knowing that this is a really tough fight and, but I just was like, why are they have sound effects? I hope they pulled it out because other than that it was a great documentary. It's um, it's just weird when you get, like you start mixing things like you're, you're adding sound effects. Talking an actual fight. Like imagine if like UFC started doing that. Like every time somebody hits somebody they added a sound effect. Like you wouldn't know what, what's real, what's not. The lines get super blurry. They have a guy like in the truck that's like got a button they press is every time you fuck somebody he's had three different sounds.

Speaker 2:          01:31:15       Boom. Pish posh. It's possible one day someone's going to do it. So I'm going to doll up some fake ass shit. I don't like it when they do it with stand up. Oh that's bad. Don't know it. They do it with TV shows. I don't like what they do with it. Just something it lets me, makes you out of it just makes me not want to watch it no more. Yeah, laugh tracks and sitcoms are very confusing, very confusing. They use these laptops, laugh tracks on sitcoms sometimes when the sitcoms aren't even shot in front of an audience or they did at one point in time that it wasn't just the, they added last juice up a joke, which they definitely do, but it was also that they did it like they, they weren't even in front of an audience at the time. Then they added like some fake laughs where they thought it should be funny, which is so weird because you're watching it at home and you're supposed to Lego, you're supposed to like go along with it, but it's so inorganic. It's almost like a light goes off. It tells you time to laugh now. Time to laugh now and I kind of has the same effect.

Speaker 10:         01:32:17       It's so weird watching Lucky Louie, which was Louis C k his first show because it was in front of a laugh track or a studio, I think it was a studio audience and it was just so weird because he would like get something out of the fridge or be like, oh no, Hey Jim Norton and to be there, it's so awkward. Well, yeah, that didn't work out that show. But uh, he figured it out. You figured out how to do it, just do it all yourself, which is really crazy that someone does that. And he does the whole thing himself. Pretty amazing. You know,

Speaker 2:          01:32:44       a lot of the writing produces it himself, edits it. He used to edit it on a little laptop. I mean, I don't know how he's doing it now, but back in the day he's talking about, I use editing is showing a 12 inch Mac book.

Speaker 10:         01:32:56       He's still always do his own for his website. He should always do his own stuff like videos. And he had like podcasts a long time ago that he used to do himself. It was like little youtube. Yeah, youtube videos. And then the podcast, well, he had a video podcast. So if you, if you go on iTunes right now and look up Louis C K podcast is actually still up there. It's really weird. How many times did he do it? Not many. Like six or seven times, but I remember back in the day before, uh, that Dane Cook, Louis C K audio thing. I would always try to help them out. Like, like, Hey, would you like any help doing videos? And he's like, I got it. I know how to, I know how to edit video. And then I'm like, oh damn. That's pretty sweet. Yeah, he always edited and he was, well he was a director too. You can directed Pootie Tang back in the DNA. That's right. Yeah, he's a, he's done a bunch of different things. Fine. He's a creative dude. He's got all those guys weird. He's weird, you know, take on things. It's a very uniquely him. And you see that on the show too, that show Louie doesn't remind you of any other show. It's weird, you know, it's like

Speaker 2:          01:33:54       very uniquely him. You know his idea of what's funny, watch what the show is successful because he does it from a to z. Well this shame he has to do everything for a year but you ADC. But that's how it becomes good. I think that's the only way to make anything and not like you. You're going to have a different idea of how to do something then Brian is, and Brian's going to have a different idea than Sam Tripoli and it's just down the road. It's the, no matter what, it's real hard to get everybody to agree on shit and it's real hard to, one of the things that make someone look really funny is their own unique like sense of humor and when you add in a bunch of other people's sense of humor, sometimes that original, whatever would be funny about the original thing just doesn't come out. It's not the same anymore because there's so many different like things that you've added to it. It's kind of like changing water down. It doesn't feel like Joey Diaz his words. Like if I saw Sitcom, somebody put a sitcom around you but you had a bunch of other guys writing for you, man, I, I'm pretty sure I'd be able to tell. I'm pretty sure I'd be able to tell that it's not the guys riding from me. It's what the network does to it. That too. That's

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       why Louie controls the thing a to z because we all know that you do the table read on Tuesday, you rehearsed fucking Wednesday, you rehearse Thursday morning and Thursday afternoon you do a run through and the fucking network comes in and the producers and then that night before you leave they give you notes and then you do it again the next day in front of those fucking people again you to give you a note. Then you're shooting in front of a live audience or whatever the fuck you do on Friday night at six o'clock. So it's, it's really weird. Like, sometimes you might have a great line and the audience laughs, but they'll come back and say, take that line out because a, it offends somebody or our next episode, you know, and you're like, what the fuck you talking about it? This is a great line. I can't put them with this shit.

Speaker 1:          01:35:40       But that's uh, what Louis success comes in that he went to the network and said, let's not do this and I'll take this money. But this is my end. I'm handling this remade the z the first time since 25 year old we know, comes in with a suit, just graduated from Syracuse to tell me how to do my comedy. The deal is over because that's what ruins all of them. That's the tough part of the comic. And you, when you're, uh, doing a, a TV show, it, you're on the weekends out there talking about getting stabbed and eating some of these asshole and now you're doing a Disney show from Tuesday to fucking Friday telling me you can't say how you got to say something else. And the show sucks. One of the great successes that you have to take it off for Roseanne Barr was that when Roseanne Barr went for it, she went for it.

Speaker 1:          01:36:25       When they told her that they wanted her to not Cosby out of the box, she went for it. But you know what she did? She went back to the comedy store and she hide all those guys that she thought the Quirky. Even if she could get one line per show out of them, they would work the $5,000 and guess what? Sometimes you know those riders, they give you a networks now 10 times. They don't learn how to write a fucking Columbia or I'm gonna fucking Philly or University of Houston, wherever they went to fucking do you know what? We were heading on a drop of a dime, bro. I like when you get a couple of comics with a couple people that know how to write and put that together, but I don't want four guys. They just specifically writers for a comic like myself, don't work for comic, like uh, the bacon guy or somebody who's clean or something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:37:11       But for guys like Jim Jeffrey, you're not going to get network fucking writers to write with his fucking craziness and his mind. You got to get two guys with a similar thing and mix them with two guys that know formats and maybe and yeah, that's how I don't think, I think he's got to write his own stuff. Oh yeah, yeah. And then, and then you come in there. No, no, listen. And they'd give you a line and how many times have they given you a fucking line and why you're looking at it after you rehearse it. I go with what my gut tells me. Well, if you say aligned to me and rehearsal and I spit it back at you, I say the first thing I say is what my gut tells me. Then they'll come over and send the bitch with the glasses and say, the line is that you're going to kill the cat yellow, right.

Speaker 1:          01:37:49       Watch this, Bam. And it works again. What's the line here? The line is the one I just said to kill a cat and getting no fucking funny response. But the network will want you to say killed the cat. I'm just saying. Right, because of the writers will tell you the writers to tell you I've, yeah, I've seen that many, many. So if the comic says fuck you, I'm going to do this line. You mix that with the two guys you got and that, because the comedians are coming from a different school of thought, the guys that are writers, they don't have a structure. I'm talking about structure and what's going work and you're gonna get four comedians together. Yes. So we'll have an explosion and we'll have helicopters and the chick flies out that cost $1 million. Oh, they didn't know that. Now they've got to rewrite it all over again.

Speaker 1:          01:38:27       You get two guys that know what the fuck they're right and the structure Shit, you get too crazy fucking comedians to write for you and then you add to the fucking mix. But guess what? Your Rogan, that's a lot of work. And even then it's hard to do. That's a lot of work. It's hard to do. It's hard to pull off. You're not going to write. It's not that many of you that you're not going to write and do everything. What you gotta do is get, listen, 10 years ago I would watch Chris Rock and I always admired that. And then I found out the real story when Chris Rock, Chris rock would use his specials. He would hire neck Louie and Richard and Richard, Jenny, he had that much faith on. They all came up together. And if you watch two of his specials in those days, you see all three of them in this special, you could see what his son, Nick Dipaolo joke in there.

Speaker 1:          01:39:11       You know, and I'm not saying, I'm going to tell the joke that Joe Rogan gave me. I'm going to add my flavor to it. You know, you're never going to, you're never going to have somebody come up there and go, Joe, dude, this line on stage state, you never that type of guy, but somebody might give you a good idea premises probably. It'll give you some good prompts. And if you watch, uh, you know, even just the fat hanging over the heel, that's a nick depalo type of thing. And then when he says that joke, you know, you saw it, you saw the development of the special, you saw that maybe it's an hour special. He put 30 minutes in, nick put 10, Richard, Jenny put three and Louie put 20. He had enough trust in those guys. That's when the specialist good. When you have guys who really know you guys that could go to, you know what?

Speaker 1:          01:39:54       You might have somebody like that, right? Something and they go, you know what? I wrote something. It's a little too wild for me, Joey. Maybe it'll work for you. And you hear it out and you're like, maybe it was, I'm not going to use it because somebody else wrote it. But you understand me sometimes once you have that type of trust and that level and you could see, you could see it in Christmas specials. It's, it's a comedy collaboration and it works. But somebody in there has to be structured. I'm funny. Joe Rogan, I don't know how to say shut off the kick, but I'm not structured. You know what I'm saying? I'm not structured well, that's because the beauty of what you do is not as structured thing. You know when you're, when you're on stage, it's just wild loose thing. That's part of the fun of it. That's the vibe. That's part of the fun of like how you perform. So like when you try to turn that into a sitcom, it's like you're capturing lightening in a bottle. Lightning only exists for a brief moment of time flashing through the sky. You know, they got, they were about to make uncle buck again. It was a black guy, black guy, Mike Abbott, who I liked, who I is doing a lot of shit he's doing

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       prior to, he's doing prior to the prom with uncle buck is anybody they, uncle buck, when they write it, they write it as a crazy guy. That guy has to be naturally crazy to sell this. You know, anytime they'll, they'll sell it now though. Saw the guy who smokes a cigarette and goes to the gym. Oh, he's edgy, you know, goes to, he's playing like volleyball with a beer in his hand or you know, something stupid where that's what they're selling instead of the attitude. That's what, that's what you want to see is the attitude. It's not what the riders, you know, his words just don't want to see another uncle buck. Yeah. I don't want to see a guy who takes the kids to the track that's been done. That's been done. Leave it alone, you know. But that's where it's at. But again, the remake, all that shit, but they don't put on wide world of sports, which is a real education.

Speaker 3:          01:41:42       You understand me? And now we got, we got real sports on HBO who they tackle those subjects. They go to India and watch the young kids with the Campbells and the whole fucking deal. So, and yeah, it was last time it was talking about the, the, the people in Nepal, the Sherpas, the US people up to the top of Mount Everest. Holy Shit. They make like $5,000 a year. Like 24 of them, 25 of them have died over the last couple of years. Scary. Scary Shit is only a hundred of them and these people are carrying all this shit up to the top of Mount Everest, day in, day out. You know they spend long fucking hours sleeping on the side of a glacier. It's scary shit. Wild Shell man. He did a really good job of capturing all wide world sports. I mean I'm real sports with Bryant Gumbel. Well you St Brian,

Speaker 10:         01:42:24       have you seen the new Nirvana? A documentary that was just announced? It's a, it's actually court. Courtney has lent all her personal movies for one. So like her home movies and stuff and there's also a 13 minute song that Kurt never released and stuff and it's, it's heartbreaking if you watch it. It's really well done and it's coming out next month or so. But it's a check it out. There's a lot it, they mix the animation and a lot of different medias with it and it's pretty depressing movie. It's hard to believe that guy killed himself even after it happened and killed them, killed them. She tried that killed him. She poisoned them. I don't know. She put the gun. Those are this whole conspiracy theory up there. Do you believe you gotta Sneeze? I don't blog. I used to believe it, but the more I watch and learn about current, it seems like he was just a tortured soul and yeah, it seems like he was, I mean heroin especially like severe heroin addictions. Very depressing. Very depressing.

Speaker 3:          01:43:19       You know what's beautiful though? What the sky, how America gets always whenever they find the recordings and the safe. I gotta take a leak or who recorded it sounds last 13 minutes from him. Listen, if it's any good, he would have fucking released it. All right. Yeah. America loves buying shit that somebody founded a fucking safe. It's fucking amazing. Oh, America loves it. Oh these are the rereleased, the unreleased Tupac, the Ga. That shit. That album was fucking terrible. Yeah. He's two pocket. If he wanted it release, he would have fucking released it. All right. The reason why it's

Speaker 10:         01:43:52       unreleased cause he listened to it and said this fucking blows. I think this movie definitely he is going to make a huge new surge of Nirvana fans that it may be, haven't really fallen into that whole yet. You know, there's a lot of young kids. I didn't even know what Nirvana is still me doing not doing nothing. Fuck is wrong with you. Well how does that you, you uh, you, the podcasts, you do a church of what's happening now. You guys now have ahd HD cameras and you're doing it. I do. You do it. How many times a week do you do it now? Twice. Twice. And have you switched it from the six in the morning? Shit that used to do now it's normal times. Yeah. What time is it? Certain days

Speaker 1:          01:44:33       different tomorrow. Two o'clock with Steven about where every day is different. We used to do it Mondays on Wednesdays, but I had some shit going on today. I could only do this with Joe. So you have to be flexible. I'm home the next four weeks so I can do it whatever fucking bad one thing. Yeah. Great. I usually always do one Monday. Monday, you got to have one of the week, Wednesday or Thursday, he'd do what the fuck you want.

Speaker 10:         01:44:55       Did you see ra or boy, Ari Shaffir this Friday he not only had, is a special that they have is also followed by his new TV show. Uh, uh, you know, at the storytelling show. Come on. Yeah, it's great. Come on. And this was like the couple of days after that Howard stern was just like, who is this Ra guy? Meanwhile, he has like two shows on a Friday night at midnight on comedy central and it's billboards everywhere of him in the fucking middle of it. All right.

Speaker 2:          01:45:21       Well he's got one billboard on sunset, but it's beautiful having it right in front of his house. You know, Howard does that. He pretends he doesn't know what you're doing, you know, and PR pretends he doesn't know like that the kid is a successful comic. You just, he mocks people, you know, it was, I mean, someone's talking shit about him. He's going to mock them. It not going to bother Google searching him. Why would he do that? Whatever he says like in his, in his reach, you know, it's Gospel. So Ari becomes a loser. It's the whole thing. Kind of funny. I can't believe that he talked about him for 25 minutes. I'm just, I understand that.

Speaker 10:         01:45:54       And he backtracked so many times. Did he listened to it? Cause he said that he never, I mean he literally said podcasts are for losers and he kind of backtrack that whole saying and he's just not paying attention to what everyone else is talking about. He's just kind of like, no, no, no, no, no. If you want to be in radio, and we're like, we're not trying to be in radio. He's just, you think he's just protecting his value before Sirius radio?

Speaker 2:          01:46:16       I think he's talking shit. And when he talks shit, people start talking about him. I think he's just, he's a smart guy. He knows what he's doing. He's like by by saying things that he like saying that our, he's like doing a standup into a podcast, you know, just I guess he's buying well if you want to be by yourself and no one's listening, you know, get a job and terrestrial radio, those jobs don't even exist anymore. I mean try and try and get, and not only that, that's not what a podcast is, what a comic is doing in a podcast and just having a good time just sitting around and talking shit. You're not trying to like, like the idea of like the pressure of being hired like somehow or another. That's good. This is what's good. What's good is the creative process. Like what comes out of a podcast when you're putting it together and the conversations flowing, you're trying to figure out what story to tell and how to say it and it comes out and people who are listening, the entertainment value, that's undeniable.

Speaker 2:          01:47:05       That's what, that's what's important. If you want to just talk about how much money's being made and where it's like you're missing the entire point, like the missing the entire point. If that's what you're talking about with stand up. If you were saying, you know, will your stand up, you stand up, you're not making any money, you don't even know what you're doing. You know I've sold out arenas, but your standup is not. Imagine a comic saying that to another comic who was trying to figure out how to do it. What's, what's, what's good about standup and what's good about podcasts is that people enjoy it. That's it. That's what's good about everything. Everything you make, whether it's a movie or a song, do people enjoy it? If they enjoy it, then you're successful, then it's successful. The idea that you can't make any money on it, it's just not true.

Speaker 2:          01:47:45       So if he says that, I feel like he's trolling, I feel like he's trying to get people to talk about them. If that's what he always did, man, you've got to understand how clever that dude was. He would go into markets and you can't, you don't just compete with a guy in a market. Okay? You go into market and you own him. You go into market, you put up fucking posters. You said you stage a fake funeral for mark and Brian, you see, give him a funeral, man. You, you, you mock people to the end of time. You spend hours talking shit about them on the radio. It's some gangster shit and that's what he always did. It's straight gangster. He would go in and just jack at town. But you've got to understand what you're dealing with. Like this guy's not stupid man. If he's talking shit, he wants people to talk shit back.

Speaker 2:          01:48:28       He knows it does a shitload of podcasts. And when you start talking shit back then, you know, you're comparing your accomplishments with his accomplishments in his head. And in his mind he can't lose. But he, I think he trolls. I used to just too smart. It's not just that he doesn't believe that like keeps saying to get a job in terrestrial radio. He doesn't even have a job in terrestrial radio. You know what I mean? He's on serious and you can't just jump right into serious obviously. But for comics, like that's not a smart move. You want to be nationwide, a podcast. Like he's got to know that guys use podcasts to sell tickets and people that most people have never heard of, you know, outside of the standup comedy and podcasts world, like Thompson Gora is not a household name, but that mother fucker is selling out places all over the country. Small theaters. He, yeah, everywhere he goes, he's selling out clubs and it's directly because of his podcast to say that that's not a good idea and that he should be on the radio in Connecticut somewhere is that's not true. So he, I don't believe, I don't think he believes that. I think he's just talking shit.

Speaker 10:         01:49:29       I think Ari Shaffir ears podcasts probably has led him to, a lot of it is a success and comedy central and in his TV show and the storytelling show and like there's a path, you know from Ari starting that podcast too, you know, and keeping up with standup comedy that, that he can't deny has helped his career

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       100%. Everybody that does a podcast has benefited from their podcast. If they do stand up every single bump

Speaker 10:         01:49:54       person, w w this guy named h diesel, he does a podcast out of Austin. He's the one that first turned me onto this whole Howard Stern podcast thing. Uh, he, uh, made a great point is if you look online, if you go to youtube and you find some low recent channel, our recent shows of Howard stern on there and then you look at recent shows have you, it's amazing the difference of the numbers. It's like there was one that he brought up that was like hundreds of thousands of somebody just, you know, you know, put up a, an episode or you put up an episode on Youtube, uh, hundreds of thousand. Then there was like one in the same time period of Howard Stern, 2000, but this is like the main guy that puts up Howard stern show every day on the youtube. So it's just interesting. What is his numbers? Cause none of us know, serious probably doesn't even know, you know.

Speaker 2:          01:50:40       Well they know, they know he's huge. Don't get it twisted. Howard Stern's gigantic. I don't, I'm not saying it's not gigantic, but what is his numbers? Well, who cares? That's your, you're doing this. You're playing the same game as he's playing now. You can't win. He's, he's Howard Stern. Like you gotta like what does his numbers? Jesus Christ, it's probably like 20 million people. Who the fuck knows what it is? I don't know how many people have Sirius satellite radio. Well, I guarantee you if people have Sirius satellite radio and they're listening to the morning, Howard Stern's, the number one thing they listen to a guarantee you, I guarantee you. I know. It's why a lot of people I know bought series in the first place. 100% it's not a small number. I mean the reason why this already thing got so huge, it really, like a lot of people might not listen on Youtube, but a lot of people are definitely listening on satellite.

Speaker 2:          01:51:23       100% like on Xm and Sirius, whatever it is, that 100% there's a lot of people listening to that. It's not a flop by any imagination. So if just because things don't get traction on Youtube, you know people listen to that show in your car. That's what the stern show is always been. You listen in your car, you listen on the way to work. When you're commuting you listen home and now because series has two channels, they have Howard 100 and Howard 101 you get his show, they get replaced throughout the day and then on 101 you get all these old shows that he did. Like you'll hear him interview in Bon Jovi and the fucking nineties or something.

Speaker 10:         01:51:56       I mean if you have an iPhone, you have every single TV show and it's free because you have youtube

Speaker 2:          01:52:02       [inaudible], Sam, Sirius, satellite radio and your price. That's what we're talking about it. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:52:09       I'm just saying that how pointless it is kind of for that kind of thing. Now that we all have youtube or cell phones and that have Bluetooth because like we can get Howard stern show right now that he did today on her phone. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:52:21       But you can't listen to it live. Like, like this morning I was listening to a s a serious the opn Jimmy show and uh, they had some guy on from boardwalk empire. I'm listening to it live. I mean he's talking live, you're hearing it live. Like when that there's something about that that's always going to be appealing. People love to, to hear a show that's going on live and you love the fact you just get in your car and you press XM and you find out what the fuck is on it or serious, you know, you press and you find out what's on. Like you don't have to go search into your podcasts, you can just hit your, your favorites. You've got one on one and you're tuning into the channel. There's always going to be a benefit in that. But they're probably go all good.

Speaker 2:          01:52:56       A wind up doing both. That's what it's probably going to be. It's probably gonna be like some sort of a serious show but also having to be a podcast too. And this the the networks like the idea that you're going to be able to keep like a lockdown on TVs, car radios with satellite, like that's not happening anymore. They're starting to, everybody knows that he doesn't like the idea that Howard stern doesn't know that is ridiculous. He knows about stitcher and cars and need to do is very savvy so he knows that they're going to have, without a doubt they're going to have Internet access in 90% of the cars and just a few years. Everybody that has a new car, like you get a Cadillac now they have this Escalade. I rented one when I was in Utah. It's fucking incredible. First of all, they're amazing. They're so smooth that it's not a, it's not a gauge anymore, not a gauge cluster.

Speaker 2:          01:53:39       It's an LCD screen with an artificial gaze. Costs are huge fucking map, like the navigation systems, giant, super comfortable ride. Magnetic suspension. It's got a built in internet connection. It's a fucking driving Internet connection. So you have like builtin Internet. Like you use it as like a wifi hub and you can have your laptop, you could download iTunes, you could fucking stream different things on the screens. It's crazy. That's this is you're going to have podcasts, apps for all those things, and you're going to be able to say, where's the Church of what's happening now? And you're going to pee. You gotta be able to press a button, you're stealing, we'll, uh, go to church of what's happening now. You know, and then like, you know, would you like to play an episode? Yes. Episode four with, uh, you know, fill in the blank. You know, whoever the fuck it is, big John McCarthy, Bam.

Speaker 2:          01:54:25       And then that shit starts playing. Welcome to the Church of what's happening. And at least science starts talking and then you drive it down the road. That's, that's in demand. And that's inevitable. It's, but right now we're not there yet. And I think guys like Howard stern are very, very clever. He's smart as shit. You know, the idea that he doesn't know that all this stuff is going on. That's preposterous. He's trolling, he trolled Ari and he got already talked shit about him and he talks shit about all right. And now it's his crazy thing and that's what he does. That's what I think.

Speaker 10:         01:54:55       I also think he, you're right, cause he's such a computer nerd and, but I also think that maybe with like all these TV shows and flying from La to, you know, or whatever he does or whatever your schedule is, maybe he doesn't, maybe he's completely a different person. He comes home, it takes a little nappy poo and wakes up and

Speaker 2:          01:55:12       I doubt it. You know what also think he's also in negotiations with serious, like there's some sort of contract things. So what is it going to do? He belittles the competition, he mocks them and then it becomes gospel, you know, to a lot of people, what he says is Gospel. We started talking about podcasts being for losers, you know, and then you know, people comparing the podcast to his show. You know, he's got a point, he's got a point, he's got like how many millions of fucking cars have serious built into them. You know, my, my car has it built in. When I bought it, it's in, it was on, I started watch right away. I don't even have to order any special package I get. Oh, how it used to have to pay for like Howard one o one Howard 100 like a special package to get opie and Anthony.

Speaker 2:          01:55:48       It was a special package. Not Anymore. Nope. It's all the same price. I'll just give me your car as soon as you get it. It's on there. I think everyone has it. I think everyone has it in their cars, but like, like I haven't been to cars and they both expired and I think a lot of people like myself called and go like, how, how much is it? And they're like, oh, it's 150 for a year. And you're like, no. Why, what $150 to take about how much booze you buy in a week. That's like a Florentine classic final studio, 54 classic vinyl.

Speaker 2:          01:56:24       I get Ivana, Soundgarden hair of the dog. I get all of that. That's, that's uh, whatever, uh, this like 10 fucking things on that. How would one 100 I don't live without Sirius radio. Mccall. I like it. I like it. I like to hold on. No, I have a, I have the phone. Brian, you've got to use your phone to get that. I have a, how many people have Spotify in their car but very tiny number if any, right? I mean think, I think everybody either has Bluetooth or the plug into their phone where they, where they, they do because every single person I know does, oh yeah, but think about your crowd. Your, you're hanging out with a bunch of young comics. You know, a lot of people don't use Bluetooth yet with their stereo. They just don't, they don't use your phone to, and if you do use it, you got to fuck with your phone while you're driving and go look through things and try to search for something with Xm.

Speaker 2:          01:57:12       You just pressed a button. It's right there. You're driving serious where I'm driving. I'm saying like the things you were saying, like the seventies radio station, the eighties radio station, they have this on Pandora, they have this on Spotify. It's free, open several steps and you're not, you're not listening. Several stuck in costs, so you just leave it there. You pay the Vig and you move on with your fucking life and express the bucket, but it's programming. It's putting rotations. I got 10 stations in the, all of them are throwing fucking eat at every minute of the day. Yeah, your preset, I don't mean you have to Spotify. I don't even know all this shit. I got it all in. Then it comes up the fucking car that took demand saying it's undeniable that it's a good value. If you're someone who sits in traffic and it's entertainment, you need entertainment.

Speaker 2:          01:57:54       It's undeniable. There's hundreds of radio stations. There's a bunch of different talks. They should just BBC stations. You tuned into an, anytime they're talking about diamond mining in Africa, you flip to the next one. They're interviewing. Someone in Bangladesh says dealing with some isis attack. It's fucking great. Again, the wise call. Good. Just because there's Spotify and just because there's, there's a lot of extra steps involved in all those things. If you're going to want to like set up, you're going to do Pandora. You're not going to listen to the BBC. You're not going to listen to Howard Stern. He not going to listen to opiod and Jimmy, if you want to hear those things and those things are good, you got to do it with serious. The idea that 150 bucks a year was a lot of money. Come on, man, that's 10 bucks a month. 10 bucks a month. Ain't shit. 10 bucks a month for every single day you get something. It seems to me like it's a value. It's just not, it's not that bad

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       a thing. It's the everything. Everybody has this idea that because it has to be one or the other, you know, they, they can all coexist. It's nothing wrong with having a satellite radio in your car. I get my wife's car and she listens to all that shit. The gentiles was listened to the gets good rush ball and all that. Fuck Shit. You know my life. This is why there's, they fucking come. I get in the car and I got to give her a look. What is this shit? She got three stations program to cause. Tell white people shit. Their world's gonna savage. Yeah. Obama's in Japan. Mrs. Oh I got in the car this morning when he alive in Japan. Mrs. Obama at the fuck. I used to listen to a couple of those guys on serious too. There's a few of those guys you can get. Those guys are awesome.

Speaker 3:          01:59:24       They just get an air dry. I can't, the only guy I like is the guy that comes on lunch touch Steve Harvey. That was my dog for you. I learned about Steve Harvey in the mountains of Colorado lunchtime. Everything ends in Colorado. Steve Harvey, the Alps are empty so you're going to do so, but do you listen to a the Steve Harvey Radio shows? Is that what it is? Whatever. Whenever Tara, I don't listen to it no more. I went like two years now. I'm stuck on lithium and classic fucking vile the way up here. They had Elton John from funeral, from a friend that I'm, you don't listen tonight. Show was just telling John Anymore. Hold on. This is what he was with Bernie Taupin. We don't like Elton John. I just want to tell him John is a, he's got this, a dolce and Gabbana boy, a band called dolce and Gabbana.

Speaker 3:          02:00:05       He's on a roll. Yeah, because they said something about gay people adopting kids or having kids. I forget what the fuck and he's gotten. Listen, let me tell you some dough. Cenk a banner done regimen. Elton John Speaks. People listen. Fuck. D F Hutton. That's the gay community. That deep, deep pocket gay community. Not these little guys jumping up and down at that place in Santa Monica. This is the deep beep money gays. They don't give a fuck. Why would anybody do that? Because shit fuck ain't people have is this. You don't fuck with Elton John. You don't fuck with Barbara Streisand. There's a couple people. You just leave the fuck alone. Let's find out what it is. Don't change a band. A band. What's up B music from Spotify. Ringwood. What else? My point was just fucking go on with the phone and crash more options for me to take this fucking car off a cliff.

Speaker 3:          02:00:55       That's what you're giving me. No, I'm just saying that the future I think of that is suspect because I think phones or cars are now having Spotify automatically in there and Pandora just like a satellite radio. And I just think the future of that is, is you know, and them now, I don't know, it just doesn't seem very good. The future of what Sirius satellite radio program, the idea that it's everything is programmed for you. The difference between that and something like Spotify or Pandora is you're going to go searching for stuff. They had the same thing. What do you mean? They have the same fight? If fight has radio stations and so does Pandora has radio station. So if you want a seventies radio station, they have that and it's just random seventies you know, it's been programmed. So it will be star based then. Then the people that'll be subscribing and of the people that specifically

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       want to see or listen to Howard stern or listen to opium Chimi. So in that case it makes him even more important because this is a fucking giant, multibillion dollar company. This is not a small endeavor. If Howard stern left, you want to talk about like the power of podcast. Here's the power of podcast. If Howard Stern said fuck you to Sirius satellite radio at the end and started his own podcast, do you have any fucking people would jump ship and leave? It would be enormous. It would crash the company. He probably wouldn't do it because he owned stock. I mean I think he does. At least that's what I've read. Wasn't that part of the thing that he owned stock in the company if he wanted to? Yeah. If he bailed and started his own like podcast show and stead, boy they, I guarantee you they're fucking numbers would drop off substantially because as time goes on, one thing you do have a point when I told you about that escalate that I rented, it has internet built into it.

Speaker 2:          02:02:34       It's not only like a step or two away from something awesome being developed for Cadillacs and the idea also if you have full time all the time, Internet connection like that and a car, all you have to do is like set up apps like an apple system or you have just like you have on your phone. I mean that could easily be the future of a car. It could be just like a phone man. It's to be nuts because you'll be able to download apps into your fucking car, but then people are going to hack your car. That's going to be an issue too. People gonna you're going to have a 24 hour internet connection in your cars. People are gonna start hacking people's cars. They're going to disabled people's breaks. Some guy's gonna fucking kill his wife by disabling or breaks. Right. They confuse things too.

Speaker 2:          02:03:12       That shit. One day you fucking dragging your windows open up. It's 20 below and you can't close them because that's what I don't like. It's like when you were a kid and you bought your first stereo and you went to that dude on the corner, you go to that $200, which stereo when I, but you want it to Fisher because it had the eight track tape cassette, the record play, and the four speakers. And he professional would say, don't do that by components because of the eight track works. Then the whole thing is damaged. Do you remember when that, uh, that controversial? Oh, you fucking think you deal with, fuck. So fucking novice used to buy components. So I didn't like the radio when I was growing up. I never bought a fucking radio. I bought an amplify. I could like I connect to the cassette to it and I had a record player with, uh, two of those fucking killer speakers.

Speaker 2:          02:03:58       I always seem to get off the trucks, whatever the Bose, this is way before bows. This is fucking alone or south is there. And uh, there was a guy who died report or what the fuck is his name? He died on sunset. He crashed his car. And, uh, that's one of the things that they were saying. They were saying that they think that this guy's car had been hacked. The fuck is his name. Mine has that shit that freaks me out. Like it's connected to the Internet. Michael Hastings. Yes. Michael Hastings. Thank you. This guy was like super critical of, um, of the military. Super critical of some, some generals in particular and the guy died his car, like he fucking hit the gas and never let up and drove right into a tree and his car exploded. Electrocute him right from the Balkans. Right. That's when they send the fucking signal right from norad and they fuck your shit right up.

Speaker 2:          02:04:54       Yeah. Allegations of foul play, getting to government, you know, in the loop. Everything was we're against would just give them to them. So I don't you want the Gulf that we know the fucking cars with where we're at in the cars. They already know what our phones, didn't they say two when he died they found Methodist system. I'm pretty sure that's what happened. I always find the Methodist system that's the way to fucking have this gown on him. And he said that he was in a very agitated state in quotes, the sounds like a hit piece, saying he was incredibly tense and worried that his materials being surveilled by the government. Friends believe that Michael's line of work led to a paranoid state. USA Today reported that in the days before his death, Hastings believes his car was being tampered with and that he was scared and wanted to leave town.

Speaker 2:          02:05:45       You know, it's, it's one thing to kill yourself, but a one thing to hit the gas full clip and drive straight into a tree. How many guys have done that? I think if you're on Meth, that would probably be where like, I'm doing it. I'm going to die. I'm gonna die. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. That's exactly right. Think about it. When you are in math, you do make some shitty choices, especially if you're about to kill yourself on meth. I just feel like most people would want it to be like 100% like hitting a tree with a car might just fuck you up. I don't know how, how hard you gotta be going to hit a tree and live. So they're saying it's fucking foul play, correct? No, they're saying they don't think it's about PLO. People think he was bananas and he drove into a fucking tree.

Speaker 2:          02:06:29       I think it's even his own family. He said that, but they might just be protecting themselves. They might just be saying that publicly because they don't, they're scared. I mean this guy was fucking with generals. Generals are professional killers. I mean that's what they are. That's what they do. They kill people overseas. They killed people that are problems and in a guy who's trying to take down the general, the general has done really good work for the United States as far as like military work and you know, been a part of some important missions and he's got a lot of clout and they think that this guy is trying to take them down. Well that guy might as well just be the enemy. You're trying to remove one of the most important components of the military. You're trying to remove a general, a general that's like been very successful at war.

Speaker 2:          02:07:08       You could easily see why some people would step in and say, you know what, we're going to take this fucking reporter out for the country, and then that's how they would believe that they were doing the right thing. That could have happened, man. I don't know. I just don't think that it's a matter of, I don't think it's a matter of impossibility. It's not impossible to control a car. In fact, there's been some CIA guys to say, you can do it. It can be done like Google that Jamie, pull up. Ken, you like Michael Hastings death. Can you remote control a car? Michael Hastings death. See if there's a, like there's a consensus on that because I think you could do it. It's a computer. It's a fucking key. I don't think there's anything that shows that you could steer the car unless it's one of those cars that has automatic steering like Michael Hastings per Sadie's. He had a Mercedes, the new Mercedes, you could drive those motherfuckers around town like 30 miles an hour. They will drive themselves. Okay. You said it, they have like a, a laser that detects cars in front of you. They slow down. There's cameras that detect where the lanes are. They turned for you.

Speaker 10:         02:08:11       My, my uh, bug my Volkswagen. I can unlock my cars through an APP or my car doors through an app loaded this

Speaker 2:          02:08:19       what has been revealed as a result of some research at universities that it's relatively easy to hack your way into the control system of a car and do such things as cause acceleration when the driver doesn't want acceleration or to throw on the brakes when the driver doesn't want the brakes on to launch an airbag. Wow. You can do some really highly destructive things now through hacking a car and it's not that hard. Wow. Wow. So if there was a cyber attack on a car, and I'm not saying there was Clark added, I think whoever did it would probably get away with it. Oh, good Lord.

Speaker 10:         02:08:52       My sink, my Ford Sync, uh, since reports to some office once a month and it tells you my break breaks, like how good my brake pads are. Like everything about my car so it knows everything about my car and has connections to every part of my car. It's got new machines and was fucking with signal most of the whole front and there was 60 days they send me reports to. Would that makes sense though? Your sleep apnea? I'm seeing he's not driving around town into a fucking tree. Fucking controlling his breathing refill.

Speaker 1:          02:09:21       You could go on a report if the end of the month, I don't know about the car thing. Well, they're going to have computers that can control like the convergently control anything, right?

Speaker 2:          02:09:30       One of our sponsors is smart apps or smart things and smart things. A is an a, you can, you can control your alarm system, your electricity shut off your lights off and on. I mean these, the, these things are like,

Speaker 1:          02:09:44       if you could do it, that means somebody else can't do it. So don't open the fucking APP. Mind your fucking business is fucking business because that means somebody else could too. So one night you're at home getting your Dick Sucked. Some 13 year old doesn't want to swat you. He wants to fucking tango. Light. Sound like fucking pump the guys thing. Your House, you know you need that shit. Don't fuck with it. Don't open a door. If you know, if you answered the email back that says you have a relative that left your 5 million, guess what you're done. You can put just delete that motherfucker. He don't even open it. Why don't you go back to a flip phone for what it was cause he avoid all of this. You and Ari. I don't know. He's already gone to flip phone. I'm going to make a confession today because a lot of people are, no, I don't even know what the fucking happens.

Speaker 1:          02:10:29       I don't have it on my fucking phone. You know the single APP on your phone? I don't know nothing to check. Twitter and hotmail. That's all I wanted to chose their apps. That's it. That's it. Those are the two absent everything else. Got another blood pressure thing. Oh you have an from my heart stress before the put my fingerprints on there. It is hard stress because one of my buddies, John Cutler up in San Francisco, send me it. Then you connect to your iPhone and check your blood pressure. I take with me on the road to the gym when I do sit ups before my head blows up. That's an APP. Yep. Yeah, but I don't know nothing about iTunes. Like I give it to my wife and go here, put this on there. I don't know nothing. I don't know people who fucking, I got myself a easy man.

Speaker 1:          02:11:10       I got my fitness pal. Dot. Come on here to count my protein, carbs and all that shit. But I don't do some incredible shit with these things. I don't do it from my phone. I do it from the house, but there's no misunderstandings. None of the time I don't have my glasses out of the fucking phone. If you email me for something, they don't get back to your text. Me, you fucked. I don't have my glasses. Forget it. The ice side is completely gone now. I'm almost done here. I'm almost fucking done here. I got to go back to the doctor like in two weeks. How bad is your eyesight? Uh, the fucking left. I listen if you see me in my car, just go on the left side. A chance on the right cause I'm like, you're fucking with that thing

Speaker 2:          02:11:50       and far. Is that everything or is it the questions? I don't see nothing. That's what the fucking closer, I don't even see tweets no more. Really? Yeah. I can't see tweets on my phone unless there's a lot of light, you know? No, those days are done John Real. It's over. Yeah. My side is really though. I could see a coke rock under a fucking carpet looking at me now. Look at me fucking now. Nothing. Nothing guys. It's a real fucking shame, but that's what happens. This is supposed to be some exercises you can do for your eyes. Steve Maxwell was telling me about the other day. It's like it's a book called throw away your glasses and see, and I had this woman on him, Katy Bowman and she's one of the things that she was saying is that you, when you, your eyes, like when you're looking at things, everything in the same distance, like you'll constantly looking at a screen and it's like having a cast on like it, it makes your, your eyes atrophy.

Speaker 2:          02:12:40       It's not good for it. Like you're supposed to be looking at things all different distances, looking at things for far away, looking at things from close up and, and you look at things all different distances, your eyes stay pretty good but when you're just constantly staring at a screen on a regular basis, your eyes start to get this shit. Definitely. Definitely with me. I could tell when I started really sitting in front of a computer, my eyesight, it just demolished it. The 44 88 eight it up like fuck. Some people are just constantly looking at their phone. That does it too. But if you can just incorporate a lot of distance looking into your life, like go outside and look at things far away like your eyes. We'll have like a better medium, like let them focus on shit that's really far away and focus on some things that are close when you do it. But you got to balance it out just like anything else, I guess. I'm sure I don't use my iPhone to the abilities. I understand what Ari went

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       back to the flip phone. It's too much of your time consumed. Yeah, that's what he felt. But I feel now that uh, you know, if I can get to get an email, I like to get my email, you know, that's very important to me. My main email, like together, discipline texts. I'll look at your fucking phone off. I don't give a fuck. I'm not going to go on there and read with capital on Yahoo. That's never been, I don't give a fuck around the rousy. I told them to do with me when I should have got nothing to do with me. I read what's important. You send me an email or call me. That's all I fucking know. Right? I don't know nothing. When I'm out of the house, you're dead. I don't take pictures. Nothing. Not Thing I'm done. I'm out there living on pip paying attention though that Instagram, no life is to finance with them.

Speaker 3:          02:14:13       I have no idea. I have no fucking idea. There's a, there's a certain aspect to it that I think is pretty cool. The idea that you can get an alert on your phone and go check about some breaking news. It's happening right now and you find out about something you would never have found out about. I got friends who are like, they sit in front of the TV waiting for something to get the phone. You're like, who the fuck? No, no. I get it. I got it. I could see that. I could see that I'm calling back. I get the message

Speaker 10:         02:14:37       gps. Just when you're somewhere you don't not and you're like, where's the closest Starbucks or where's something like Ari says it's, he's not on his phone as much now that he has his phone bullshit cause he's spending 10 times longer trying to type a sentence to me. Like the other day we're going back and forth. I'm just like, what is, Oh yeah, he's on the flip phone and he's like, yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:14:57       got it. Takes longer to make text message. I just call you. Let's just call this, you know. That's what I'm saying. You don't make texts anyway. I don't want to do it. I'm going to send nobody pictures. Don't send me nothing. I'm a simple guy. Does an infant of infamous video that Brian made a long time ago of a Senate Joey Diaz texts. Oh, I was like at the old Houston lab stuff. That was fun. That was, yeah. What year was that from?

Speaker 10:         02:15:20       Joey d is ready to die. It was called and five and it was, yeah, around that.

Speaker 3:          02:15:25       It was 10 years ago. Not Crazy. In 2005 Pete still had that club. Can you believe that shit? Wow. That's crazy. It's sad. That club doesn't exist anymore. That was one of the all time great clubs. It's clad though. Why the club is don't fucking really not glad that the club was stolen. Cyst and a lot of new ones have open. I've gone to a lot of good clubs the last three years that I didn't even know existed. Cleveland's a good club. Indianapolis is a rocking little city. I had never been there. Buffalo's always rocks. How long he in Portland been around seven years. Seven years. No Way. Now it's like three or four maybe. I all I know about Portland. Portland is Houston. Texas in 1990 comedy has become the thing to do and it feels good when you go up there as a comment.

Speaker 3:          02:16:12       Oh yeah. And Houston, all the bartenders didn't know your name. Just some hip guy was down. Let's go down and have a beer. That's it. That's what it's become important. I feel that I like when I go up there, the afterwards, the food in those trucks, the, the weather for three days. That's probably one of the best up and coming right now. Portland. And, but all the helium says Mike and motherfuckers, all those helium's ain't fucking hour. He called me the first time he goes, you were right about Portland. The Cuban sandwich just fucking premium. They ain't fucking around food. Portland is the other place where I have the ranch dressing. The other place where you do have much, they have the spicy ranch dressing over potato tots. It makes your asshole. You actually liked some ranch dressing? No revelation. That's the lady told me after I ate it, it's was my fucking ordered it.

Speaker 3:          02:17:02       It came. It's paint. It's red. It's like for ego. Well it's probably like a, it's not really like the ranch. You motherfuckers either the home ranch mixed with red hot, got malaria. No, there's a lot of like crafts restaurants up there that are making their own food that she makes the wrong songs and there's a fucking place I instagrammed it. There was a truck that we went to. It was a tie. Cheeseburger. Holy Shit. It was good. What was ana? Oh my God. That peanut saute sauce. Hot Peppers for like a grilled Jalapenos. I don't know what kind of cheese it was. There's a bunch of other shit on it. I had two of them. I had to go back. I couldn't even fit it in my stomach. Like I crammed that fucker down my throat because it was so good. It was so delicious. I mean, it was probably the most delicious cheeseburger I've ever had in my life.

Speaker 3:          02:17:45       That's it right there. It's called the brunch box. Yeah. You don't even tell by that picture. That picture. It's got bacon on it is a cheeseburger and see those fucking grilled Jalapenos and could God, it was good fucking a man. I was like, I can't believe how delicious it says. Like it was so unique. It was such a bunch of different flavors in your mouth, but they're like into shit like that down there, like little small businesses that do a great job and make really good food. It's like it's an art form to a lot of these people and that's why they, I think that's why standups sorta thrives in that city too. It's a very creative city. Standup is amazing there. That fucking helium was spectacular. Spectacular. So fun. The fucking staff to the people Refa took the food to the weather. It's kind of, you know, if you're here for a month and it's fucking sunny, you go up there and it's got like that Batman weather, like Gotham siblings like fucking gloom.

Speaker 3:          02:18:39       You appreciate that later me come home. Yes you do. You know, and when I went to Cleveland it's like fucking with Batman. I just told them the real Luzia everybody the joke of this place where I'm from the plane, you know like Cleveland, no fuck around and look at you. When he got played Cleveland hat, that's Atlanta. That's Cleveland Indians. Oh Shit. Look at you. I was told I'm not claiming that. It's hilarious. The the, at the Portland it's everything's rainy and so it's all like the green is like a different green, like the grass. You don't seem like dry grass up there. That kras is glowing and globally. That shit raw. Fuck the juicer. Pretty pieces of grass. You test positive and shit. The fuck mean. As long as he take your vitamin D because you're not going to get a lot of sunshine in the winter, but if you take your vitamin D and deal with that, is this that it's a relaxed place to, there's not that many people up

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       there. I think Portland only has like a half a million or something. Right. How many people Google that shit? I bet. I'm going to guess. How many people do you guess? I'm guessing somewhere between five and 600 times in Portland. Yeah. At say 1.2 million. No, 2.1 million. The Wikipedia official population. 609,000 bloons done. Thank you. Wow. All right, so I've been going to the mall. I been going to Portland. It's just 98 I had a friend, Floyd, the kid, he used to go to die. I was just like the kid. I used to call him Floyd. The kids loved Jay Phillips. He's my brother from different, my loosening, grand rapids, Michigan and Floyd's. Jake Phillips was my friend in Portland, so I met him during the Seattle comedy competition and he said, listen, if you want to come to Portland I get you to harvest. That was the big club for years.

Speaker 1:          02:20:12       That club for five days day, you want to shoot yourself Saturday night, the grand finale, the club owner invites his mother to the club and she sits in the front row. Either gives you the thumbs up like fucking gladiator or the summer's done, you know? Yeah, she does his mother. Oh my God. So they attract a different type. They attract like comedians, magicians and hit someone. Helium went to Portland. You just knocked him out of the fucking race. It's two different worlds. Helium is bringing us killers. They still got guys that play the trumpet onstage and jump up and down. They used to bookstand hope once a year, the elite club that once a year they worked at dirty week and it was either Stan hope and Ingram or Stan hope and me. That's it. One year when we can place in Seattle. That was like super squeaky clean at one point was a giggles giggles.

Speaker 1:          02:21:02       Is that still around? No, the owner, Terri went back to Utah. He's a Mormon. He had a club in fucking whatever that was popular. So he bought giggles from this dude that was a fucking pilot in Vietnam and he was half full box and he used to drive a Jaguar and he hated dirty comedy. But he hired me. I used to put them together to hire me. But the beauty is I got in with the waitress. They did drugs. Cool. So I made the one way just party and with fucking the singer from Alice and chains though she used to tell him lanes anytime you want to come and do some heroin with, can I use to sit that on on like I didn't know what else in chain. Well, I'm not going to lie to him. At the time I had no idea. And uh, I used to tell the waitress to go in the room and see what the feature act was for the following week.

Speaker 1:          02:21:48       This is how fucked up this guy was. So they'd say he doesn't have a feature of the rest of the month. So after I'd work on Saturday, first thing Monday morning nine oh one I would call him and go whatever his name was. Hey Joey did and said, can I feature this week? Let me see if it's open. Yes. A topic. Hey, let me ask you, when was the last time you were at the club? Eight years ago. He was so old box. He was gone. Like his mind was gone. Here's the better one. Thursday night was Olympia, so you had to drive to Olympia door one night and then Friday and Saturday night he had four shows at the club. Giggles Olympia was one 50 for the feature and a hundred of show. She got a five 50 I would go to, I would do Olympia and then go there Friday night and take a door off at two 50 and Saturday night.

Speaker 1:          02:22:34       He's still paying me the five 50 better than me. I got that guy every fucking week when I was there. So it was too old. He just didn't know it was, no, he wasn't that old. He was just, he was gone. He did. And he would ask me on Monday, when was the last time you were there? Six years ago. Okay, I see you Thursday night. It was fucking crazy. Let me tell you how crazy he was. So you were on stage and there was a a window next to the stage. So that's how you knew when he pulled up. So I would work dirty, go up their dicks. Fuck you Cox. And as soon as I see his light, I count the five. Soon as he hit the door and he walked me walking into the back, I do knock knock jokes. So I let the girl on fire and we walked through the jungle and that and he'd leave.

Speaker 1:          02:23:16       Watch it for a minute. I met, I had to be cleaned for one minute and then he disappeared and then you went right back to your routine. But here's where it gets better. I worked with, there's a guy up day, I can't remember his name, is fucking great guy out of Seattle. He's a tennis coach at the University of Washington. This guy is bad ass. He's been on the road for years, did all the TV shows. He's a gentlemen and the cleanest comic working and who he was on stage one night I was featuring for him and that own the walked in and confused me for him when he got off the stage like what the hell? The matter with you working dirty and the guy's like, I don't even say a curse. Bob Bob, that was his name. Bob. And he goes, yes you were. I just watch it being dirty.

Speaker 1:          02:24:01       It was me. He got shot down and yet just the mind was gone. They gave him a check and he hit him up in Seattle and he bought a comedy club. He wouldn't even drink. He just locked himself in his fucking office. So he sold it to Terry and Terry wanted it all clean and then it went on and that was in the u district. That club, isn't it? What's The u district and say putting the club and sits on across the street from Oakland [inaudible] you're going to customers. You have the u district where the University of Washington Heights. It was a couple of treats away from the main strip where everything crack cracker lax. That's a great, interesting strip. That's your Bruce Lee opened this first fucking school. Really right up dad yet, bro. Seattle. Bruce Lee walked around Seattle dog. That's wild, and he opened his first school up there and not what you get man, but with those black guys, that's where it all started.

Speaker 1:          02:24:48       That was, there's a large Chinese immigrant because they went there and he came to Oakland up. It was what all the rumors came that the mafia went and told them not to teach white people and they told him to suck his dick. Then he, then they sent the dragon over there, send the dragon and kicked him in the spine. He went to the hospital and that's when he wrote the Tao of Jeet Kune Doe. That's a story that day in the movie. That's not what happened. They did send people over and they were going to fucking kill him. Those fucking try ads, but that's not what you think. They did kill them. I ultimately, 10 years later, you know, listen man, you got to put money in their pocket. Once you put money in their pocket, they keep you alive. Once wanted to deal with and could a dragon, that's all an American deal.

Speaker 1:          02:25:28       That's what happened. He cut him out of wherever. Find out the truth about that. That would be, that would be unbelievably fascinating. Document really killed documents. But then 30 years later they killed his son and nobody went to jail. I stuck man. Put a bullet in the fucking gun with what you were talking. It's like a piece of a bullet or something. Whatever the fuck he went to jail for that there wasn't a trial. Nothing. Linda, Linda Lee went up there. I miss my son. They must have given her a fucking check too. She's worth gazillions when the late, yeah. Think about it. Who gets the estate? His two kids, the daughter and Linda Lee. That's it. Who's left. He may give Dan Inosanto a fucking taste from it. Yeah. The uh, the, there's a lot of theories about this guy's death. It's really interesting. I was, listen guys, I'm 52 years old.

Speaker 1:          02:26:19       Not only was I there, I mean I wasn't in China when he died, but I was dead guys. I was in the middle of this. This guy was my everything. Joe Rogan. I had been hit in the head with a lunchbox. I was a quiet kid and it was like that girl that fell off the bike. She got no titties. She wouldn't give me pussy. But after she got hit in the head, she grew tits and she sucked everybody's Dick. I my worry about that girl. And he would tell him me how they hit the side of a lump in their head where they get to true. When she got very, uh, what's the word? Sexual, you know, I got crazy. So what fuels my craziness was Batman. But when Batman fought the Green Hornet, that took me to different levels of craziness. My father had just died.

Speaker 1:          02:26:57       I was beating everything up. I used to have a French poodle. I used to kick. My mother told me, you know, you got, and it fueled me. It killed me. Once Bruce Lee came along, he introduced martial arts to this country in a different way. Like that was it. Those karate schools filled up. My first experience with karate, which with Rashad's father, Jedi Bravo's brown belt, the guy that plays the Brazilians, your son's father was my first karate teacher on 90th street and Amsterdam up on the west side of that and that was all a black school, Joe Rohde and you had to carry a gate. It was a black guy with a white belt and you had a walk in and give them a car. None of the card was a gold you fist. I'll never forget that. And they had Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. And they would mark when they come in and they give you the car, you couldn't talk, you couldn't fucking talk.

Speaker 1:          02:27:44       You had to go back. There were signs, father put your gear on and you had to go to the front and stand like this and they like clap. You got to do the cat stance from here, from right hand Joburg and you got to do the whole cat stance and going, I still remember all that shit. I still remember my first form. I stayed with Sean's father. It was white, yellow, green belt, purple belt. I stayed with Sean's father, Rashad Rashad, but it was fucking famous from the time I was maybe six and a half to maybe nine. I went to that karate school religiously and when they sent me to Catholic school during the week, I would go on Saturday mornings and would be pissed off. I wouldn't fuck you been all we got Rashad's father used [inaudible] resigns. Father used to make you run with your Guiana in the street with no shoes on.

Speaker 1:          02:28:31       Whether it was snow or not. This was, this was the beauty that was a different karate in those days. Dog. It ain't this shit now that they didn't just give you about pro. You had got beat up and then beat motherfuckers up, but here's the beauty of it. You had a run in front of the kids that you went to school with. They'd be at the playground. Hey, you went with a white fucking geek running down Amsterdam Avenue and shit. So the next day you'd go to school and they're like, look, a fucking Johnny Kung Fu in time and you got to fight fucking 10 fucking kids and shit because they'd see you. This is a different time for folks who don't know what we were talking about. Croissant is a handout. That's his character, the priests, all the fucking people that, hey man, what happened with you and that Brazilian guy, not that guy.

Speaker 1:          02:29:12       He's my friend. He's not really Brazilian, dare I said it. It's like they're trying to keep this God damn secret. It's not a Brazilian, he's an American actor. Slash. Comedian. A very funny man, like saw an orange. So during that Nicky Swanson, but here's what kills that nick sorts and that's how he calls it his fucking name. But here's what the killer was. Well, I'm involved in all this Joe Rogan. At the time my mom moves to Jersey and on Saturdays I have to go to the bar in Jersey on, have to go to the Bronx and do the numbers. When I went to Catholic school on Sunday, Saturday is my fault. My step father would pick me up Thursday night. Friday was movie night. I needed to go to the root three fucking driving. That's why I saw enter the Dragon. No, I saw Chinese connection and five fingers of death.

Speaker 1:          02:30:02       I'm a drop line. You mother fuckers, that's when the guy's hand would turn purple because he do the eye in palm technique. That was just on El Rey. Fucking you gotta give a shout out to Robert Rodriguez. He put it on being all dot Hempel or heads almost fucking blew up. That's all. That was the first martial arts movie that was released in the United States when his hand turned red and I have to get, he puts it through the guy, but I saw those too. Here's another fact. Hit me, hit me. Here's the fact that really kills the America. This is what really throws a twist in it. Uh, what's his young man's name? And Jamie put on the date of Bruce Lee's death and put the date up of the release event to the Dragon. Why is, what does it mean? Go look just telling me what does it mean?

Speaker 1:          02:30:45       One of the other, it would happen one week apart. That's the kinky thing. This is the biggest movie in the cut. Do you under the fucking stand me. This movie came out on the fucking Friday. By Saturday you were on the phone with everybody, uncle, whatever. You got to go see Bruce Lee. He fucked everything up. When did Bruce Lee die? August 19th, 1973 to, yeah, one of the July 20th, 1973. When did the movie got released? That was the weird part of it. And this guy was a fucking John era and all of a sudden, but look at his face. Look at his face.

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       Go back to his fucking face. Chinese are the best people at embalming in their fucking face, in the casket looking at his fucking face. That guy took a beaten dog, doesn't even look like him. That's what they were selling in Chinatown. A week later, those pictures of Bruce Lee guided. Click that. Click that fucking video. See what he tells you? The fucking truth story. Looking at that shit. Shelly, what are you talking about? The crazy person that's video. The true story.

Speaker 7:          02:32:00       What kind of movies? Watch Kung Fu and yet man,

Speaker 3:          02:32:18       deadly weapons ever develop bear.

Speaker 7:          02:32:24       This is just fucking around, man. That's all it says is that as well. I'm a,

Speaker 2:          02:32:32       she's still alive. Yeah. Billions. Billions. What he saw Justin in t shirt weeping. He does a year. Oh yeah, I got a few of them. The roots of fight ones. Yeah. This is a bullshit video.

Speaker 7:          02:32:44       Hold on. You want to keep watching it?

Speaker 3:          02:32:51       [inaudible] challenge champion.

Speaker 7:          02:32:55       Look at that shirt. That one.

Speaker 6:          02:33:09       Now hold on one sec. Picture hand comes up and then put the drag him. Tell me this guy was in bad shape. Oh, he has some Hema fucking Toba. We can just look up the, we can just look up the death photo instead of having to watch this horrible movie they watch. All of them will be horrible.

Speaker 2:          02:33:24       Well, he was there for original wife beater where? Who are a white theater before Bruce Lee. Nobody did. Right. Who the fuck more those? That wasn't common. He was the first guy with a six pack revoke the movie, had a six pack. Who in a movie we'd show their six pack. What guy? And a move. Even Chuck Norris, when you saw him, you just kind of smooth like no one never looked like this before. Like where a guy took his shirt off and sort of flexing and you see a six pack and all the sinew and muscles. Tarzan. Tarzan was smooth. Tarzan was like a fit dude, but he was smooth. No one's ever done Tarzan. Right? That's a movie that no one ever really nailed. Nobody ever really, you really believe some dudes out there living with monkeys can't believe you watched that whole thing and that death foot it. Even in it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       Fuck. It confuses people today. Don't know how much of an impact, personally, you have no idea. When I wasn't getting a job, it kills me when I see documentaries and they're talking for like John Jones. I Love Jon Jones be at $20 you didn't see the impact of the black kids trying to town on Saturdays. We'll be back. No white kids eat and everything. I used to go to China town, hit the stick. It was a cat. A lizard. It didn't matter. I wanted to be like Bruce sleep, bro. Yeah matter. I had the shoes. I had the thing I didn't sense at the house. Me and mom, my mom's a Santa Maria check. She'd come in like, what the fuck is this incense? Get this. Are you fucking crazy? I beat and rice for a long time. I went on a rice diet, was going fucking nuts.

Speaker 1:          02:35:04       She was like, Oh, neat and chatty and eat Chinese food to be like Bruce Lee. I everything I did everything. I had the palm that you rub on your hands. I am Paul. I fucking was trying to get a plane ticket to Hong Kong. I was crazy. I was nuts. What's his stuff do you rubbing your hands to Ramallah? Cina they have that and then they have this ointment that you put on. It's like a liquid. It's like chin, chin, Tiger Balm. It's a little, it's a little thicker and you use it for the IOM palm technique. So you rub it on your hands and you hit a bag before you strike something. Ah. And it really, yeah, it's that important. You put it on your elbows, your joints. Remember these to have those stores, you should buy it. You can buy a Ninja stars. They just haven't been Chinatown.

Speaker 1:          02:35:40       You could go by throwing stars. Yeah, but there will never be sharp you. I'm really going to war. I got four stars on my pocket. I really throw it out a motherfucker. And then other than that, not even sticking into would that have been told you? You've got to take them home and sharpen them. That was always the fucking, by the way, the ones that were going in Boston, they said they sold ones that had sharp edges to them. I used to get black belt magazine and granted that was my magazine is a narrower sharp though cause I got a few of those and we'd be like, throw me against walls, century martial arts catalog. You'd get that catalog. You can order all kinds of shit. Coco Bolo, noon chucks. I was not telling him [inaudible] I used to get my shit from the Honda. Honda was the random martial arts and they had a store on Broadway, a fifth avenue.

Speaker 1:          02:36:21       When you go in there as a martial arts kid, you would come, your head would blow up. When I was 10 I would save all my money. I would work at a bar and I would go over there and I'm Saturdays was 600 gorillas. This was way before weed. This is what you lot of people don't understand. I stayed in martial arts and the reason why I quit was because those kids didn't get hot. I couldn't, I couldn't hide it from them. No one. I liked those guys. You know, I used to go to class and in those days I went to my mother's Bar, a done and I went to karate and in those days you were a kid, but you went to the kids' class and you stay for the men's class and the men fucked you up. And that's the guys that helped the board feet.

Speaker 1:          02:36:56       The upper belts would fuck you up. I would leave there at nine nine 30 and walk home after two hours of that shit. And sometimes we'd go, I go to North Bergen, go to my house and go to Mario Diaz, his house. He was a Chinese Cuban kid and he had a basement and that, that's where everybody met. Like in those days, there was no Brazilian Jujitsu, contrived in the tournament's. Did you ever fight? Yeah, but I thought semi contact I here, my leg would always slip and I'd hit you in the head and I get disqualified, but I always won first place in the form. So my goal was February of 1979 I had a goal on my birthday to 19 I said, I'm going to go to this tournament. It was a regional New Jersey, torn them. My goal was to take first place and the form first place and fighting, and I was going to quit Joe road.

Speaker 1:          02:37:42       That's it. I was going to go to that tournament that Sunday and quit and never go back to karate. I was gonna focus on basketball and I went to the tournament. I got disqualified for kicking butt. I took first in the form and on the way out. Good forums. Yeah. This was when I was issued a rule karate. This was on 22nd. The guy's name was Nelson Orleans, the Wayne Orlando. He was another Vietnam. That boat. He white dude like Chuck Norris. And uh, he looked at your report card? He was, he was a little bit more serious. He didn't really, it wasn't a nice guy, but he had good for him. You know, he had good karate taught and that was the last, that was the last when I left there I think I was a green daughter. So, so that's when you were doing these forms?

Speaker 1:          02:38:24       Yeah. Do you think you remember those? Like when you did that Joey karate thing? We used to run around throwing kicks and punches. That was part of it. Those little moves. I still remember one form that you learned what you put your hand down the elbow, you let them go and then punch. It was like a really neat for him, you know, because I used to hang out with food. Job Pie Kung Fu guys. I used to hang out with how Kido motherfuckers, I used to hang out with a couple of Cubans that were into judo, you know one time and you city that had a huge rush and judo school. There was also William Bolt. He was directing. He was the original Ikea though, Dude. Oh Shit. Oh Shit.

Speaker 1:          02:39:06       I'm telling you. I had my homemade heads. This video have Nah, Nah, they, they keep putting in box 6,000 they keep redoing them and shit. Who's is this? Do you have a youtube page? There's not somebody else's shit. Oh my God. She didn't have a youtube page where this shit is all up. I don't even have, I think Damon has the originals and shit like that. This is probably Daymond's well you is that his a youtube channel? Fuck the Owens Joey karate for the UFC minute. A lot of people see me on the medical mile all the time ago. Huh? A lot of people see me in the sports reports, but nobody really knows how many trains fucking assassin.

Speaker 6:          02:39:43       I lost my rent on the fucking boat ride over. It knocked me Donald Greenberg. I'm fighting to get it back. You understand me? I take my shit's guide fucking jungles in China. Hong Kong, Bolivia. That's why train with fucking savages. Fucking guys flying through the air. But you're lucky you caught me today.

Speaker 1:          02:40:02       Joined karate is going to give you a lock for UFC and it's all about fucking Brazil this week. He understand me. My man, Anderson Silva isn't a fuck people up this weekend in the Sammy. He went through Chris Leben,

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       Chris Leben, forest Whitaker, forest Griffin. Let me show you what this motherfucker though. First off, he's going to get them in a clinic. That's a movie type shit. You know it's not really a dialing over the Thai restaurant. I'm fucking guy with it, Susan. We got them in the clench. Couple knees to the fucking head. A kick. I'm going a sidekick. He's a gentleman to some fucking Samurai or some on bar or some fucking, and he's in a book and chop them up. It's that simple. Why don't you do your Joey karate predictions because you got to move on. You gotta move on. These are amazing though. I can't do this no more. I'm too old to old people would say, who's this fucking fat old guy trying to be shit. Don't listen to them. I'm going to hang up. Wow. Every once in a while you gotta hang up the gate dog.

Speaker 3:          02:41:05       He can't be doing that shit on national Tyrone ups for. I think you should do it. I love it. I love all that. That's my love for it. I, I had it so I know how much it affected me. After that, my life went downhill. The next six months in my life were a disaster after her martial arts. I hit the number. Yeah. When I quit to it, that was it. That was the beginning of that. Six months later, my mom died. It was all, but when I got my life back together, that's what it was. I got back into its great for people. Now you need to do predictions for fights. I'm too out of it anymore. But you're good at it. Even if you're wrong. It's hilarious. Listen, I, I felt in my heart those shiny nose, but I couldn't say it. People don't think you see the fight.

Speaker 3:          02:41:44       You got find credible pedes versus, oh, Sandra's pedis. I thought Pedis had an edge in the standup for showers are great car. The girl Joanna, she hits hard. Uh, you know, over and everybody's jumping up and down over road, right? Don't get to fucking excited. It was a pretty good proof point for this test to come back. Oh wait for the test to come back on Thursday. All right. Before you guys started jumping up and down, he beat up Roy Nelson, poor Roy Nelson. You know, a lot of people said that after the fight dos Anjos they go, please don't touch these all ripped unbelievable performance. Like this guy, he's gotta be like somehow or another, this guy's got to get through this. That was incredible. I thought. I really did think that pet is going to have an edge in the standup and dose on Joseph was just uh, just attacking from the very beginning of the fight in the standup, like lit him up man.

Speaker 3:          02:42:35       Straight left hands like super fast. Like faster than I've ever seen him fight before. His last two fights. He's looks sensational. He looked a level above his game. So, uh, I just, I didn't know it was going to be that I really did from the beat more of a, but he took away. He took them down and that way bro, that's the, that's the fucking thing sometimes just doesn't take down. She has paid. That's how you know Chael Sonnen that take down slows you down man. That was some great fights in that car. You know what else it was though too. It wasn't just the takedowns, it was the fucking kick to the body that left power kick to the body. He was smashing

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       them with that thing. Every time you get hit with a kick like that, that should takes a lot of your movement away. It takes a lot of your breath away. It takes a lot of your energy away till Sandra just smashed on. What that kick over and over again and smashed. And what's trait lefts? I think pedestals just taken a back. I just don't think he expected it. I think he felt like the dose on Joe's would be probably slower than him and move a little more hesitant on the feet. But those aren't just, just, just, just attack.

Speaker 1:          02:43:38       I am a big fan of fights. This particular fights at my dick gets hard. Yeah, that was a big one for me. That was a big one for me. But what's coming? Cause whatever happens with Serone and look a walkie, the Russian beep, that bad motherfucker with the war had mother for whatever happens there. I can't even pick a winner. Like it's too much for my fucking scalped even thinking about. So whatever happens that fight to where that gets this fucking savage. So that's two fights. I get to see that it gets hard and it spills all over it. So I love it. This is tremendous. I love this type of shit. My original fight was dropped array against Yoel Romero. That went down to fucking see you get that name right. Every time there was Cuban and the names just flow it. I know y'all well remember it was easy as just today is nobody fucks up jocker Ray's name yet.

Speaker 1:          02:44:28       I believe Nijmegen Madoff. That's too much from him. It's crazy because you know what? You can't say it. 10 years ago you guys were talking to me about Jackie, right? Yeah, he's Boston. Years ago when you had, he had the tape. We'll get those cars that would do an hour by Jack Rail. It's like nobody talks about them in the UFC and he's more dangerous than ever. They just don't fight that motherfucker know well, he's been injured. He's got a good two pretty significant shoulder injury. He, I know he had surgery. He had showed low injury. He had did something but know no, that guy's fireworks at that weight level and see what he did to, you should know Cami. It was fucking smashing. You shouldn't call me. Yeah, you shouldn't. Was done by his, his attacks monster. He's putting together, you know, it's very nice to see guys like nobody.

Speaker 1:          02:45:18       Nobody, nobody. First of all, nobody would have called 10 years ago that the UFC would be as big as it is today, but nobody really thought Robbie Lawler would put the pieces together. You know, it happens to comics. You've seen him 10 years ago, they go to Montreal to get a little success to deal, doesn't fall through, and instead of putting the tail between their legs, they become comics. They keep working and you'll see him 10 years later. Now they're fucking powerhouses. Powerhouses was the same thing happens in fighting. I believe it. You know this guy that does this, he takes a couple of losses. He gets better and better and better and next thing you know, his ground game now is part of what is striking is striking is part of this wrestling. You know, it just all fits and once it all fits, you're not going to stop somebody. You're not going to stop me for a while till they overthink themselves. Once they overthink themselves, that's like commonly give or this off, he'd go up to

Speaker 2:          02:46:09       you don't get the reaction you want. Keep it fucking simple bitch. Fuck are you to overthink things once we start thinking of this, when we kill ourselves, but I see it, I see where Robbie Lawler, guys like Robbie Lawler have to really make you believe in any of the field that you may do, whether you're an artist, the singer, that you know what? You took your lumps for a few years. You really did man, but something you did, whatever you're doing now, stick to it. You said it was because he wasn't inspiring anymore. He just says, yeah, you know, it's, it's, people put the pieces together. That's not what he did though. He got better once you started sparring again real, but no, no. He put the pieces together after 10 years. He was a good fighter. He was a slugger. When it is, is American top team. That's a big one.

Speaker 2:          02:46:51       It's huge. He went to a real big gym and he got really dedicated and you know, he became a more mature man. You know, he's in his thirties now. He's a real mature professional athlete now. It's just, he was a wild motherfucker when he was young, but now he's a real champion. I mean Robbie trains like a fucking champion and he always had the ability. He always had the mindset for sure. And now you're seeing just the fruits of his Labor. He's just, he's grown up, he's got a wife and a kid now. It's a different animal and now he's a totally different animal and he's, he's, you know, he's coming out for blood, man. He's coming out for blood. Jonny Andrews look good. Look real good, good. Danowitz it didn't like that fight, but that's looked for guy to do that to Matt Brown holding down like that.

Speaker 2:          02:47:30       Beat him up like that. Like I was impressed. I was impressed that that's how you're supposed to fight when you can wrestle that way. Why would you stay? I mean everybody wants everybody to fight in a way that's not smart. Like for a guy like Johnny Hendricks, that's a smart way to fight. You. Throw some punches on your feet, take that motherfucker down anytime you want. Beat him up when he can. And when you got a guy like Matt Brown, you better do that. She has peaked. Did a federal judge. Yeah, but you just did it for years. You got to do that with a guy like kind of brown. You wouldn't even stand up with them. That's, that's crazy. You have a huge advantage. If you take him to the ground on your feet, you're pretty much dead. Even if you just decided to slug it out with them.

Speaker 2:          02:48:05       I mean Johnny might have more one punch knockout power because Johnny had some pretty crazy one punch knockout. So when people go flying, like he's got magic in his hand. Like that red hand from Kung Fu. Like he sends guys flying like doesn't do it as much anymore. But like if you go back to some of his highlight reel knockout, it's like the John Fitch one or the Martin Kampmann one. They go flying, he says blam he just cracks him with that left hand. So you add that and then the boy tie of Matt Brown, Matte Miles Nasty. You know Johnny might be able to hit harder with one shot, but Matt Brown was knocked some motherfuckers dead too and he comes after you, man. You know, if you just going to stand with him and just trade with them. Robbie Lawler did it, but Robbie Lawler's the fucking champ. You know he went five rounds with Matt Brown and he's going to do Robbie Lawler's going to fight Rory Macdonald again. That's going to be fucking crazy. Was that? I think that's Hebrew. Where? When is that? I'm not sure. I want to say. Hmm. I don't know man.

Speaker 2:          02:49:07       Uh, 89 July 11th July. Oh, okay. Jesus Christ. That's the big one in Vegas. Oh, what's July 11th that's the Big Vegas coach, which was that? Who's done that? Who's on that? Who was on that car? Jamie. That's international fight week and last week. Big One dude. Sub Dog. Wait, that's a big one. So you know I love it. That is a giant card. That's the July card. Uconn McGregor versus Josie Aldo. Who? Jesus fucking Christ. That's right. Oh good Lord. That's a fucking, I have an answer now. That's all you have. That's all you need. That's all you need this for that. What are you going to put this already sold out? As soon as it gets on sale, it sold out the, they're going to the amount of people that are going to come over from Ireland. There's going to be people watching that shit. I'm close to her kid.

Speaker 2:          02:49:58       It's going to be all throughout the Vegas is going to look like Ireland. It's going to be madness. Madness. Nobody brings motherfuckers like that guy. That guy brings a lot of fucking people to the fight. Fuck Saint Paddy's Day. Wow. Robbie Lawler and Rory Macdonald and Josie Aldo and Conor McGregor on one car. My God. Good Lord God. Keep together. Please, please, please. You know, right now it's march, April, May, June, three months for some bad shit to happen to someone's knee. Three months for somebody to get put the kiss of death because the speech itself, it's interesting like when this is happening too, like what time in their career, you know, Mcgregor on the rise and all those been a champ for a long time. Like it's a good time. If Mcgregor was gonna fight them, now's a good time to fight him. And he's had so many really tough fights.

Speaker 2:          02:50:55       Really wars, you know it's fucking interesting fight man. Really interesting fight. And then Robin and Rory is going to be interesting to map five rounds. You know, who knows what the fuck's going to happen and that fight. Who knows what like strategy Roy's gonna Employ Roy. He apparently had something wrong with his ankle. He was talking about it when he came in here for that fight. Couldn't move around as much as he would like to. Stood right in front of Robbie when wonder when he's going out, how he's going to fight him when they fight in July. Cause you know he got a lot better since then. Rory got a lot better. Robbie got better since then. They both got better. Ravi being the champ now he's going to really have like, he's going to have a pretty significant advantage as far as like confidence and mindset. Like having already beat him once, beat him and hurt him and then now also being the champ. But that doesn't mean anything man. Rory, he's talented as shit. He's a really fun guy to watch Roy because he's such a student of fighting, you know, he doesn't have like ridiculous athleticism, ridiculous knockout power. It just does everything great. Everything he does is great, knows what to do. It's foot works. Excellent. Real smart about it. An

Speaker 3:          02:52:06       interesting dude on the podcast too and if you listen to the one that I did with him, it's one of my favorite ones with fighters. He's a real down to earth dudes to totally honest about it too. Like the way stairs down guys. Like, like it looks like dead in the eyes and shit. And he's like, well dude was staring at me and I didn't want to turn away like a bitch. It's like, instead of sounding like subset of a psycho, it's like, well I guess that makes sense. What's the next Joey Diaz when he doing, what do you got going on this weekend? We uh, I'm here with you guys. Yeah, you're all here all weekend. Yeah, I'm going to Ebi dog. Oh, that's right.

I'll be tweeting, it's going to cost or whatever, but please it's going to be great. They have a lot of fucking young guys on the, uh, you know, I'm going to be scary.

It's the last season Joe did last weekend. Please watch it and just kicked out of the DV. I'll tell your neighbor, you know, if you have a direct TV, it'll be on east coast time. So if you're on comedy central, Directv, it'd be 9:30 PM if you will have a lot of different cable companies will have it on a regular west coast time, which means it'll be 1230 and 1230 on the east coast, aren't you? Fucks all right. That's it. Can I love you? Let me take it back later.
