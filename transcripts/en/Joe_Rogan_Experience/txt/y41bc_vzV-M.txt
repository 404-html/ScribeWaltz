Speaker 1:          00:00:10       Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:00:16       Uh, with me today, this Friday night, you can catch him live on spike TV. Glory 19 rights number 19. Yes sir. Stitch my Joe Schilling live from Los Angeles. Welcome aboard brother. Pull that sucker right up to your face. Don't be shy. You're drinking distilled water. Huh? That's uh, to cut weight. Is that what that is? Yes sir. How much she cut? Uh mm. I try to cut like 12 pounds of water. Maybe a little less, but uh, the process, it's like five gallons of water over three days. Is there like a science to this or is this like, does everybody do the same thing or like it seems like a lot of people have different methods on how to do this. Yeah, a lot of people have different messages and methods of, I read about it online probably five years ago from some wrestler and we tried it and it worked really well for me, so I just keep the same way. But uh, I'll do two gallons of water, like my Wayne's on Thursday. So I started on Sunday, two gallons of distilled water on Sunday,

Speaker 1:          00:01:08       right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:01:09       Two gallons on Sunday, two gallons on Monday, one gallon Tuesday to Wednesday, and then Wednesday for 24 hours. I won't drink any water, no salt, and just kind of comes right off. So Wednesday, no water all the way through Thursday. No water the way ends a Thursday. Yeah. And because of the distilled water, because this distilled water has no minerals in it, it's just pure water. It just flushes through your system. Is that the idea behind it? And it hasn't had, it doesn't have any minerals so that your body doesn't hold on to it. And because it's flushing through system, it pulls all the other minerals out with it. So you know, the first two days, uh, you just pee and like crazy, you're sweating like crazy. Put on deodorant, you're still sweating like crazy. Your body feels like it's over flooded with water and uh, that last 24 hour period, it's still in that same cycle and you're, you know, the rest of the water just comes right out.

Speaker 2:          00:01:56       Yeah. See, I would think that that would be not good for you. That's probably not distilled water. It just seems like, cause I know my friend Aubrey, he went on um, this weird diet of a distilled water, like he thought like distilled water be pure and he started getting dizzy and shit. I think you, and he went and got himself checked out and they're like, dude, you don't have any fucking minerals in your system. Like you can't be doing that. It's definitely not a healthy thing. It's not a, you know, I definitely don't advocate it for anything other than cutting weight. What do you weigh in at a one 87 weigh in at one 87 you walk around somewhere around, if I'm walking around like maybe six weeks ago, it was probably like two, 10 to 12, you know, if that's eating whatever I want, you know, drinking beer and doing whatever I want to do is everybody's got their own little ideas about what should be done as far as like how much weight to cut before you compete. Some guys think cut the minimum amount possible and then there's these extreme dudes that cut like 30, 40 pounds. Yeah. Uh, it really comes down to everybody. And then also like your style of fighting. Some guys I think need to feel strong, a lot bigger and stronger because maybe they're lacking or because they,

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       you know, whatever reason they need to be bigger and stronger than the other guy. But this is a hindrance. You know, I've cut too much weight and over hydrated and learned lessons that way where, you know, yeah. I think when I fought Simon mark is the second time. Um, when I flew to Vegas, I still had like one gallon of distilled water I supposed to drink and they wouldn't let me take it on the plane, giant gallon of water. And as soon as I landed they had me do impress and stuff and I didn't get to drink that last gallon of water. Um, so I started drinking coffee like crazy thinking. Well that's diuretic. It helped me lose the water. And when that 24 hour period came or it was time to get the weight, I hadn't really dropped anything. I was still like 22 pounds over. So I had to cut 22 pounds and 24 hours and Whoa. It was terrible. It was awful. I've seen, you know, the first round I came out strong, I was, I felt really good. And then after the second round it was like, it was almost like, you know when you have a dream and you've tried to fight somebody but you're laying on your arm, you can't get the wrench off. It was just like that. And uh, yeah, it was a bad performance. So I learned from that one a lot.

Speaker 4:          00:04:01       The point of diminishing returns. That's a big one when it comes to weight cutting, right? It's, it's almost like a whole nother event in itself. There's like the fight, the training for the fight, the preparation skills, training and conditioning, all that jazz. And then there's this weight cutting thing that's a totally different event. And guys fail at it. Like this past weekend, two big important fights. The guys failed that at John Linacre failed for like the fifth fucking time. The Guy can't make one 25 but he wants to be the bigger guy. You know, he doesn't want to fight one 35 and then Calvin, Kelvin Gaslamp's same thing. Couldn't, couldn't make one 70 for like the fourth time. It's, I don't know how many times Calvin's Ms, not as many as Linacre, but he's, you know, he's cutting it close many times.

Speaker 3:          00:04:43       He got a guy like Anthony Johnson. It was like, really? I had a really bad reputation in the UFC. He got cut because he couldn't make weight and then, uh, finally decided to stick to his natural weight and he's killing it, you know? So it's ridiculous. It's a, it's a weird balancing act. I think everybody has their own, you know, you've got to learn, learn your lessons and work from anywhere.

Speaker 4:          00:05:01       There's never been a guy like Johnson who like at one 70, you know, he's a good fighter, very good, but struggles to make weight and then Fades Leighton fights because he's depleting the shit out of his body, goes all the way up to heavyweight and beats the shit out. Andre Arlovski and you're like, what the fuck? A heavyweight. And then drops down to two oh five to compete in the UFC. Makes wait no problem. And is the number one contender now and just terrifying, terrifying fighter. Amazing. It's amazing how this guy like not torturing his body is now one of the best fighters on earth. Whereas three years ago he didn't have a career. It's career was fucked up all just because of weight cutting.

Speaker 3:          00:05:39       Yeah. You know, it's a, it's a weird, weird thing, you know, uh, if you don't do the weight cutting and the, or we did like same day wanes, then you still have guys that are going to try to cut the weight and fight the same.

Speaker 4:          00:05:50       Yeah. Healthy. You know, it's terrible boy, especially striking sports. It's terrible for you with wrestling, but guys get away with it. Um, but with combat sports, anytime you're, you were involving head strikes you, you really don't have enough time to replenish all the water that protects your brain, all the water in your, in your head. And that was one of the issues that people used to have back in the old days where these to Wayne and fight on the same day. They changed that around the duck. Who Kim fight, I believe. It's also when they dropped it from 15 rounds to 12 or boxing because they just felt like 15 is too long and they changed the bus. The uh, the gloves. Heavyweights used to wear Aidan's clothes and then now it's, I think you have to be under one 45, two B. Any downs?

Speaker 4:          00:06:32       Clothes. Wow. I mean, can you imagine heavyweight fighting with Aiden's clothes? It's basically just a different style, you know? Wow. Well how about the Jack Johnson days where they used to wear those Everlast bag gloves? There's a little tea. They were just Bexley knuckle pads. That's crazy. Well, there's some guys that think, and I'm, I'm one of them, that MMA would probably be more realistic and better if no one wore gloves. I feel like if you can need someone in the face, elbows, someone in the face, kick someone in the face, why you punched him in the face with gloves on. It just protects your hands more than anything. And also the wrists, like having your wrist taped up nice and solid. Like it makes it so that you can hit people harder. You could be much more careless with your punches. Like if you had bare knuckles, it would be a much more realistic like scenario as far as like what you can do with your body, you've and everything up and wrap and everything nice and tight and solid and padding it, you know, you're turning your hand to a different thing.

Speaker 4:          00:07:30       Right? Well it's like some athletic commissions allow you to tape your ankle. Some people, some athletic nutritionists don't, you know, if you watch like the, uh, like the okay ones and stuff, you'll see like butter, hurry in. And these guys have like a huge amount of padding placed over their ankle and their foot that padding is not protecting the person they're hitting is protecting you. So if you're, if you're ripping kicks and you kick somebody in the elbow, you know, and you have a pad on it, it's going to protect you. You're gonna be more likely to keep kicking then if you smashed your foot in the first one. So yeah, it's kind of interesting. Yeah. I think protected teeth protect your balls. That's it. I think maybe that's the best way to go, but everybody has this thing where it would look more barbaric if somehow or another your knuckles weren't protected bright.

Speaker 4:          00:08:12       Well then also you've got to look at it from like a promotion standpoint. You know, if everybody was breaking their hands and, and fights, you know, they wouldn't, as a fan we wouldn't get to see those fights, you know, as often as we'd like to do to see them. You know. So that is true. But when you talk about like, uh, like the impact on the problems with brain damage and, and you know, the side effects for guys after their career, can you imagine if we had even less padding on our hands and you know, it's, well they think that there would be actually less brain damage cause guys wouldn't get hit as much. You'd have to be much more judicious with where you placed your punches and you know, because of the fact that you, you know, if you hit somebody in the forehead, you're most likely going to snap your knuckles. Right. He'd be a little bit more careful. I don't know. It's a weird argument. Yeah. It's like the same argument with, they've said that if

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       football players didn't have pads, it didn't have helmets, it would be a safer game for the players. But of course it put football, they're not punching each other in the face. Yeah. And there's always going to be that one guy that like, just like the one gift they did same day way. And there's always gonna be that one guy that thinks he can still cut 30 pounds and fight the day of guys are, yeah. The one guy who doesn't care and keeps hitting the person when his hands broken, you know? That's, uh, yeah, that's true. That's true. So you were in camp with Nick Diaz and preparation for his fight this past weekend with Anderson Silva, which was an amazing fight. You know, and I've been thinking a lot about that fight after it was over. And one of the things that really, um, really like locked into my head was there's a lot of people that are calling for Anderson to retire now.

Speaker 2:          00:09:39       You know, and they're saying that, uh, you know, and even Chris Weidman is one of them. He said he'd like to see Anderson retire, but I watched the fight and I was thinking about myself after the fight, like with nick in, in Silva, that was a better fight then nick and Carlos condit it was a better fight then GSP and nick, like, these are, these are, it was a good fight. It was a good competitive, exciting fight. And, um, you know, Anderson Silva fighting nick the Nick Diaz is a tough motherfucker. He's a good fighter. He's very smart and very crafty. And I think that, uh, you know, like the guy coming off of those two fights, it's almost like just, we expect more of him then have just a regular fighter. Like, like if that was GSP in his prime and he put on the exact same performance and if you just, you know, CGI GSPs body and made someone watched the fight, this good fight while at the beginning was kind of ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          00:10:31       Nick was clowning him, which was hilarious. I was howling laughing. I couldn't, I couldn't stop myself. I was slapping the table when he laid down and put his head like he's taking a nap. We were in the corner laughing. He couldn't believe it. I was worried about him, you know, going into the fight. I felt a lot of responsibility for him, uh, kickboxing wise, you know. Right. And I felt like my, my job helping him out, you know, he's one of my good friends. I played with him anyway, but in this fight at a camp, I was kind of more of a coaching and um, I felt a lot of responsibility. No, not him, not to get caught. And you know, did I teach him, did I teach them the right things that I tell them enough stuff, felt like a lot of responsibility. And, uh, you're gonna be yelling out instructions or whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:11:10       And he did that and then I was like, you know, and then he stood up and walked right out and with his hands down, I'm like, I, I'll get fucking hit. Right, right, right. But yeah, I was super proud of him. Um, yeah, that, that's happened to me in the past too, with the, you know, when I fought calculi nobody, nobody thought it was going to win. That was Joe's going to get destroyed, you know, and I was the only one that believed that I was gonna win. And then once I had to beat him decisively, then it was all he should retire. He's not good anymore. And I think that's just not fair. You know, it's like the guy comes back from, uh, you know, two losses and one of them was a horrific, you know, Shin break and then Nick Diaz does, wouldn't, you know, before the fight, everyone thought nick wasn't going to go more than one round. You know, he was going to get murdered by the, you know, and

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       then nick puts on a great performance. Anderson, you know, Nick's hard to fight and it's hard to finish, you know, but then all of a sudden it's all he, he's not the same guy. He's, he's, he should retire. I just think that's not fair for Anderson or for Nick.

Speaker 4:          00:12:05       Yeah, I agree. I think Anderson did, like I said, I think he did better than Carlos condit did. He did better than George Saint Pierre did. George essentially fought him a little bit on the feet, but most of the fight he took them down, you know, and tried to take them down and control on the ground. And Georgia is a very strong guy. He's got real good top control. But you know, Anderson stood up with him and the entire fight was taking place, kickboxing and I think Anderson looked good, you know, and especially when you come off to big losses like that and your head's all fucked up and you know, everybody's calling on you to retire first of all, the first fight had to fuck with his confidence. So hard to it did that cause he was clowning and he got caught, which is everyone's worst nightmare because like when you're clowning, you're trying to make fun of your opponent and then boom, you get cracked with a big left hook and the lights go out and you're like no way that way. Like to lose that way after all those victories, after the Vito Belfort fight, after fucking up jail son and in the rematch and after all those spectacular victories against James Irvin and Forrest Griffin. And so, you know, to lose like that, I was like, Holy Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:13:13       Yeah. I mean that's, that was w going into the camp, I was looking at stuff cause you know, it was a really tough fight for nick and uh, you know, a lot of people didn't think he was gonna, you know, Forrest Griffin when the fight first came out so that, you know, it was just silly fight. It wasn't, I don't know, I wouldn't call it a super fight, you know, he's just too small for that, you know, and I think a lot of people count or not. But when I was looking at Anderson's fights, um, things that I noticed where people would say he was showboating or whatever, I think that when it didn't go his way against, uh, uh, Chris Weidman, the first time he started, he kind of broken mentally and that's why he started showboating. And I had done that in the past and paid for it.

Speaker 3:          00:13:50       But ultimately I think that his style is to bait people into coming so he can use his reach and then catching them a shot. So with Nick, you know, my thing was you have to find that middle range somehow, you know, either get him to come at you or go just enough that you're inside of that middle range, but not go all the way into the clinch and get and get stuck in his clinch, you know. And, uh, that was, I think I had a lot to do with nick baiting him to come forward. And then I think I also messed with a Anderson's head. No one's ever, no one's ever clown to Anderson. You know, a lot of these guys go in there and they, uh, one I think they get surprised by, there's not prepared to fight that level of kickboxing. You know, they're not used to seeing that, that level of striking, that speed, that range, those, those moves.

Speaker 3:          00:14:33       And then the other thing is that they, uh, they get out there and they're like, I'm fighting, you know, the best striker in the world. This is the goat is the goal. And I think that was a big thing for nick was, you know, I don't think nick police for a second that he's the greatest fighter of all time. You know what I mean? And same thing with jail son. And the first time he fought him, chill, fun for all this stuff that she'll said chair really believed he was going to beat Anderson Silva that night, which is why he did beat him for, you know, almost the entire fight until he got caught. I think the second fight might be, it was a little different, but I think mostly the guys that he fought didn't really think that they could, they didn't visualize themselves winning that fight and that gave it to Anderson.

Speaker 4:          00:15:08       Well, Anderson is a great counter striker and that's always been what he's most spectacular at. I mean, he will lead, but most of the time he only does it when he has a massive advantage. Like the first couple of rounds against Damien Maia, like he was going after Maya. But Damien Maia is like applauding guy who doesn't have good strike where his speech, especially back then, it didn't have good striking. But like if you look at like the tallest latest fight or if you look at, um, um, the Patrick [inaudible] fight, he likes to lay back and let guys come to him. And when guys just stand there and wait for him to come, the fights get really boring. Like he, he was involved in a few stinkers everybody kind of forgot about. And that was because he's not really, he's not the attacking style of fighter. Like, there's some guys that just fucking attack.

Speaker 4:          00:15:55       They just go like rumble. Like Anthony Johnson goes after you bell rings, he's charging at you throwing bombs. Anderson has never been that kind of a fight. It's always been like much more of a tactician. And then there's always the air of invincibility. Right. But that air of invincibility is gone. It's completely gone. Gone. I think it's gone. It was so weird seeing him like weeping after the fight too. And then nick goes and picks him up. That was pretty bad as you know. And Nick was like, come on man, you can't be crying. Yeah, you're the greatest of all time. You can't be crying.

Speaker 3:          00:16:26       You know, Nick and Nate, they get a painted to be these like bad guys. And you know, that's part of the persona that, you know, they promote and that that's all well and good, but like they're very, very respectful. But you know, when the, um, uh, when nick beat Frank Shamrock, he was on the ground after the fight and nick reached down and picked him up and said, you know, you're a legend. You can't be on the floor stand up or whatever. Yeah. And this is, but all people see is, you know, they go for the stare down at the press conference and Netflix him off. And frank shamrock grabs his balls. But they're both very respectful fighters and uh, you know, uh, I think they get, they get a bad rap sometimes. Well, he definitely gets

Speaker 4:          00:17:00       crazy before the fight and anxious and, but that's to be expected. And the shit talking. Look, son Sue said it and the art of war, you know, uh, Miyamoto Musashi talked about it and the book of five rings ditch, there's all sorts of things that go on in a fight and, and any contest, there's advantages to be had and there's mental advantages that if you do not take advantage of those mental advantages and your opponent does, you're at a disadvantage. And when nick immediately starts to fight and he's like, he's got his hands out to, to Anderson, like what Bitch, what pitch? And he's walking towards him, come on, what the fuck you going to do? Come on, what are you gonna do? And you see him talking like constantly talking and you'd just see Anderson, like people get flustered when nick does that big time. He does it in sparring to, does he really? Yeah, he does look good.

Speaker 3:          00:17:46       My Mat Nicho was brought in for actually the, uh, for, uh, Nate's fight with violence. Roney and when it got to the gym, uh, Nate had hurt his neck or something, was going to the, had to go to the chiropractor or something and they were like, I'll just wait Nickleby here you can spar with nick. And I was like, okay. So like nick shows up and I'm a big fan of these guys, you know, like just, I was kind of like, you know, a little struck and uh, nick shows up and he's just, yeah, I'm like totally coached upon me. And I was like, so are we going to spar it? We're going to fire at night. He's like, unifier right now, you know, and it, but it was just like, just like he walks into the cage, you know, kind of like, just look at me up and down kind of thing. And then, you know, we, we sparked it. It was really hard. We had like a really good, a really hard session and after that he was like kickboxing, Huh. So yeah, if you want to hang out after, you know, and we started hanging out after that, but it was, uh, it was very much like a like is, you know, that's, that's who he is, you know? It's uh, yeah. What kind of insight can you give us to, why is he liked that? Like what is, uh, what's going on behind behind eyes?

Speaker 3:          00:18:53       Honestly, I couldn't, you know, I spent a mix, a good friend of mine, I couldn't tell you what the hell is going on in his head. That's just who he is. Um, I think he gets people thinking like he doesn't know what he's doing or he's crazy, but I guarantee like he, once you figure out and he knows exactly what he's doing all the time, like there was a plan, which they're totally is, then, uh, you know, you, you're worried about him sometime. Like what'd he, what's he doing? Well, he's an enigma and far it's like you look at the way he behaves. You Go, oh, okay, well this is like a thug was just treat guy. And then you find out, oh no, no, no. He's, he's on this incredibly clean, organic diet. He runs triathlons on a regular basis. The fucking guy swims back from Alcatraz.

Speaker 3:          00:19:34       I mean, he's just an incredible endurance athlete is not, this is not like a dummy. This is a very calculated guy. Legit black belt in Jujitsu. Like very, very good on the ground. His boxing's outstanding. There's too much good. There's too much. Like too much preparation. Too much discipline, too much intelligence in, in the way he carries himself inside the inside the, the competition. He's not dumb at all. He's not though. No, he's very smart. And he's an enigma. Yeah. Some of the stuff he talks about it, it's just like, you know, I want to like take notes, you know, like the Diet stuff. He's always on me. My Shit. If I drink rock stars in energy drinks, you know, smoked cigarettes from time to time. He's like, he's just very much not, did the cigarette thing come from ty from training Muay Thai because so many ties, smoke cigarettes.

Speaker 3:          00:20:23       Um, it started when I was a kid, you know, uh, my, my dad always smoked my, my step, I'm over smoke. My brothers, I'm the youngest of three. They were smooth from Ohio. Everybody was smoking back in the day. And I just started when I was a kid. And then I think when I started doing kickboxing it was more like, okay. Like there was other, I guess I made excuses. There was other people that smoke cigarettes kind of thing. I mean, I don't have a kid at all, but I'm not, you know how often you smoke cigarettes?

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       I smoke cigarettes pretty often. Really? Like right now. He'd just woken right now while you're in training? Yup. No Shit. No, I like a pack a day. Uh, I tried to go

Speaker 3:          00:20:57       back, you know, when I'm having fights, um, just because you know, from running I'm training really hard. But yeah, I'm a regular small group. Cigarettes,

Speaker 4:          00:21:04       Jesus Christ job. It's not a terrible, I'm not going to hide who I am. You know, some people do, uh, have vices and whatnot, but what's incredible is you fought and I fucking glory tournament, which was a brutal tournament which I went to in La. It was amazing that fight with Simon markets. When I went into the fourth round, he caught him with that right hand. First of all, that is a fucking war for one fight. But the fact that you had a fight three fucking times in a night against world class fighters like that, Wayne Barrett and your next fight, Jesus Christ and then Levon, right leaven in the finals, who's one of the best in the world. That is a crazy fucking night of combat. Yeah, it was. It was. It was nuts. What the fuck is the next day feel like you have to that man, it was terrible. How many seconds does he smoke? The next day I got a mannequin. We let me say this, so after this

Speaker 3:          00:21:58       man, don't smoke case cigarettes, kids, it's bad for it. Don't smoke. You don't smoke. It's really not a joke. And like people, you constantly hear shit from people like Joe and Nick and all of the other people that you don't, you don't get, um, people don't want to respect you as much weed. He smoked cigarettes and make dumb choices like that. And, and the fighting community, you know, it is a, it is what it is, but will you have great cardio, which is weird. I trained really hard. I'm a very hard worker when it's time to buckle down, like I buckled.

Speaker 4:          00:22:26       But how much of an edge do you think you would have more if you didn't have?

Speaker 3:          00:22:31       I've thought about that for a long time. I'm like, God damn dude, probably would have more of an edge, but like you might be the baddest motherfucker ever if you quit cigarettes. Uh, well I don't think I'm that far off from it now to be honest. It's true. Pretty close. Pretty close. Um, but, uh, yeah, after I knocked out Simon and the glory a tournament, we're in the back dressing room and, you know, they want me to lay down an ice, me and all that stuff. And I'm like, coach, let's go outside. Let's go, you know, you smoked a cigarette in my wedding. I went outside after a Simon and I had my hands wrapped and walking out in the security's like, where are you going? And be like, I'll be right back. Smoke cigarette, calm down a little bit, felt a little better. And then, um, yeah, I felt it w it was such a insane night that night after the Simon fight.

Speaker 3:          00:23:15       It was, I was really pumped, but like I was banged up, but it felt I was really on like this high from beating him and he had beat me twice in the past. And it was really a, it was a big moment for me. And then, uh, the Wayne Barrett fight was just a really frustrating, it was a really mentally challenging fight. You know, his style really. Uh, the first time we fought it really frustrated me and I, I did what Anderson did with, um, with Weidman the first time I kind of cracked under like the frustration I put my hands on my hips and you know, I kind of gave away fights. What style? Like describe his style of, it's just very, it's very different. It's almost like he makes it a piece. He's got very strong box. He's got heavy hands, he's very, he's very big.

Speaker 3:          00:23:54       He was the first person I fought at one 85, where the guy that I weighed in against and the guy got in the ring with for two very different sizes, you know, and um, that messed with me a little bit, but he, he was running away. He, uh, not running away, but he was trying to use his movement. And every time I would try to throw, I just got really frustrated by him not, not engaging me, you know. And, um, that was something I had to really learn from. And uh, going into the second fight, I was ready for that, prepared for it. And I knew it was going to be an ugly fight and it wasn't going to be, uh, you know, the type of fight that I really liked that Simon is the type of guy I like to fight. You know, I like to be in essentially like a war.

Speaker 3:          00:24:30       Let's fight, let's, let's get it on, you know. And Wayne was like stepping backwards and put his foot on the rope and jumping off the ropes and like doing like a lot of weird stuff. That was just frustrating for me. So I had to stay focused in that fight. And then I got the w I honestly didn't know who won the fight because it was so neither one of us were really scoring. But you know, after watching the video I see that I want to fight. Um, and then, so I had about 30 minutes after the Simon fight before I got up for Wayne. But after the Wayne fight, it was like go in the back, change your gloves. And it was, there was one fight between us. It was, I think it was like nine minutes before I was back in the ring again and I was walking to the ring and I just kept thinking like, how the fuck am I going to do?

Speaker 3:          00:25:09       Like what am I, this is like my calling, like this is fucking crazy. And it was in the back and he was just like, don't, how the fuck are going to do this dude? Like my legs were just not at all up and down. My face hurt from headbutts and, and getting dropped when, when, uh, Simon dropped me in the second round and the first fight, um, he hit me right on the chin and it didn't really affect me mentally. I never got rocked by it. My legs went out right away and I felt all of the punch, like in my neck. It was like pop up and my neck and uh, yeah, walking out to fight our Tim, I was just really proud that I had the balls, I guess to do what I was doing. Like I was, I was more like in shock of what I was capable of, but I didn't, I really didn't feel like I had anything left to win the fight. You know what? I was on my way to the ring and I was just really proud.

Speaker 4:          00:25:54       That's some archaic shit. Those three fights in one night to get world class fighters to fight three times in one night. Like, uh, I went there and I talked to Kevin K who you know, is one of the big wigs over it. Spike and I said, this is awesome. Like, you know, the, the, this event is awesome. These fighters are awesome. It's so cool that you guys have worldclass kickboxing go but fuck all this crazy fighting three fights in one night. I go, this is dangerous. This is not smart. I, if you guys lose somebody because of this, if someone dies like a worldclass guy dies because of this, you guys look like assholes. Like don't do this anymore. Yeah. I mean, I don't know if it's that dramatic. I mean, I couldn't be, if a guy gets through, right. It could be if you have a war, if a guy has a war with another guy and gets dropped three or four times in a fight, like you know some fucking George Foreman, Ron Lyle type shit, what they just blasting each the back and forth and one guy

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       manages to just get through by the skin of his teeth and then he gets head kicked and hour later by somebody else. That shit is no Bueno. Right. You know, and that is a possibility. Like you fight, you should be able, you should fight once in a night. You know, you, you're, you're in camp, you're training for a long time. I mean, obviously you can do it, you did it, but if you had a, if you had your choice to be at your best to fight a guy like 11 yeah. You know, you want to, you want to be at your best, you want to go through a full training camp and you don't want to have two fights that fucking day, nine minutes before you fight one of the best kickboxers on earth. And it's like when you're going into that tournament,

Speaker 3:          00:27:21       both times that if I live in your, your training campus for that first fight, you know, and then in the back of your mind somewhere, it's like, oh, well if I get to the next round, like if it could be this guy, it could be that guy. You kind of try to get some sort of game plan for everybody. But then the third fight after that, you're just, you know, I hadn't even thought about getting to 11 in that tournament or how I was gonna fight him. It was beating Simon who had beat me twice, you know, and then beating Wayne and then, you know, it was just a, it was really tough and yet neither one. I mean, it wasn't at my best, obviously it was, it was all beat up when I fought him. So I think the fans deserve to see, you know, same thing with, uh, with the first time I fought a 11. It was the second fight in a tournament that we fought. And, uh, yeah, it would be really nice to see really who is, who's the best, who's the, you know, on when they're on there. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:28:07       yeah, that's true. Right. The first time you fought him was the second fight in a tournament too. That's so crazy, man. And that turned out

Speaker 3:          00:28:14       was nuts because I was supposed to fight Steve Wakeling, which at the time was the number two guy in the world. And then I knew that I'd be fighting 11 in the final just because of his matchup and a like six days before the fight Wakeland pulled out of the fight and they gave me Kingo Shimizu who I'd never heard of who was like the Japanese, a champion who used to fight a heavyweight and was coming down to the middle weight and uh, you know, I had like six days to watch tape on him and try to figure out a strategy. So

Speaker 2:          00:28:38       11 such a slippery guy too. You were the first guy to ever catch him like that, you know, you had him really fucking hurt. Like I thought he was done. Like, Kudos to that guy for getting through it because you cracked him and then on the way down you caught him with a knee. I think that knee actually will come up to be honest. And why I watch it. I was like, he was dropping like he was out on the way down and then my knee, I think it was like that second impact, like kind of brought him back. But yeah, I couldn't believe you got, how weird is it that that's real. Like guys had been knocked back, awake, right, knocked out and then boom, they get hit again and then all of a sudden they're back in the fight. It's very shit a lot in the UFC, whether these guys are out limp and then right when the ref breaks and there they're going for a leg or they know they're coming back to sort of, um, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:29:22       You see guys had their eyes roll back behind their head and then they get hit again and it's almost like they refocus like the, the new jolt of electricity to their brain, like clear, you know? It's very weird. That's another thing, like with the mean, we've seen it with like Dan Henderson and some of those fights were like, oh, he's out. And then he comes back, or like a check Congo when his fight with a guy, I can't remember his name. The Guy Pat Barry. Yeah. Like he was gone and then call it, came back and hit him. You know. So Pat Barry fight with Molly. Casa was hard to watch. Yeah, that was hard to watch. Padbury is a great guy. I love that dude. He's such a fun dude. But man, he's had some rough Kaos over the last couple of years where he had never been KOD. And then he gets killed by Congo and then it gets Kale by Lavar Johnson.

Speaker 2:          00:30:10       But the movie costs one was hard to watch. That was hard to watch. That was a hell of a shot. I like that guy, Zach. He's a, he seems like a really, really good guy. He's cool. I was happy for him, but yeah, it was a, he seems like a really good guy. Um, but he's another one. Like he's not, he's not built like a fighter. He's pill like some crazy giant bodybuilder dude, which is great for like around and a half and then you get into the third round or fourth or fifth did you find a championship fight? And like, you know what you saw, he fought, uh, two fights in one night in that last tournament. Right. And in the second term he just was a different guy. He's a different guy. Like whereas you can be the same guy for the first round as you can for the fifth round.

Speaker 2:          00:30:52       Those big guys, they w we were saying earlier about cutting all that weight, right? They just, when you have that much muscle to feed, like there's, there's definitely benefits. You could bum rush a guy and you, you're just a machine for as long as you have oxygen. But there's that weird middle balance where you're trying to find the comfortable middle ground between being ridiculously strong and being an endurance athlete. Yeah. Terry, so could you was a, have had issues with that, right? I mean, when he first came on the scene in pride, he's like, not like just who the hell is this? Oh, Rona. And knocks out Nogueira and then UFC could see like he was really strong and then he would kind of fade and then later on. So I think he has mental issues too. I think there's a little bit of a confidence issue too when it comes to when you talk to the people that have trained with them and the people in this camp, you know, sometimes guys get through that, you know, Vituro went for through a long stage where I had confidence issues and he got through that some, you know, it's not insurmountable, but uh, but yeah, definitely the muscle have packing all that muscle is not good for you.

Speaker 2:          00:31:53       It's just, it doesn't, it doesn't help you know, it, it helps a little, makes you really strong. If you're a grappler, you know, could certainly give you some advantage. But those guys, man, when especially when you're, if you're built like that and you're trying to fight five rounds, now you're taking a crazy gamble. Not Gamble is I'm going to get this guy out of there in the first couple of rounds and then you've got a guy like we were talking about king the Alaska is just, yeah, he's huge, but it has like a ridiculous cardio, you know, it's uh, he's just a, Freeman's are just so weird, right? Yeah. They vary so much, man. They vary so much. You know, you get guys that like, you know, you remember cabbage? Yeah. Back in the old day, man, I love cabbage cat, which was awesome. It was awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:32:34       You could hit Kabbage with a fucking tree that you could pull a tree out of the roots and, and climbing off the side of his head and he would smile at you. You know, that guy could just take this unbelievable punch. Yeah. And that's just biological. He's just born that way. Yeah. But it's like, you know, somebody told me that it had a great chin and they're, the, nick had a great, somebody sits on by when a great chin and I said, you know, don't ever say that about me doing. Then people start telling you, you can take a great shot or you have a great chain, it means your defense is bad. You know what I mean? And they can only last so long. And then you know, you see it one guy, you can go take shots forever. Then one fight later he cannot take a shot and like chocolate dough chocolate.

Speaker 2:          00:33:12       Dell is an end. Dan Henderson, this last fight against Musashi, right, saucy hit him with a punch that Dan would have eaten like a tic tac earlier in his career and his legs go. Just everybody's got a certain amount of holes. Jermaine Taylor was like that. Oh yeah, yeah. Go with public. Knocked him out. He was fantastic. Boxers still hit all the skills but just couldn't take a punch. Anyway. Yeah, this is just a a point where you reach where you're, you know, and it's also how you prepare, right? Like how much you, how many shots were taken in the gym, you know, and how are you, how are we training? Are you training smart defensively? Some guys are just fucking full pedal to the metal on offense. You know? That's how they train. That's how they think. That's how they fight. And then when it comes to defensive skills, like they might have like an a plus for an office but their defense might be like a c, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:33:58       And then when it starts going their way and they climbed up, they don't know what to do. They have to think instead of just being instinctive and rolling with stuff cause it's a natural part of your everyday thing. That's a weird thing about fighting man. It's like how much emphasis, especially when it comes to MMA, how much emphasis to put on striking, how much emphasis to put on grappling, how much emphasis to put on your cardio and strength and conditioning and how much to put on skills. And I think that a huge part of that that's missing. I think in a lot of people or even just in this conversation, it's like the mental aspect. You know, you can train perfect. You could have a decent weight class, you could do everything correctly and that two hours before the fight from the time you check in to the time that you walk out in that ring, if you're not mentally strong enough and prepared for that, you just don't perform.

Speaker 2:          00:34:45       You know what I mean? And uh, you know, was it, was Anderson Silva that prepared for Nick to, to lay down and start heckling him? Most certainly, no, it was, uh, a lot of the, so I think for me, I, um, I hired a mind coach, uh, when I first started with glory and has been a huge, uh, it's been a huge change in my career. And when you see a mind coach that's interesting that he's like, it's not a like a sports psychologist. You call it a mind coach. Yeah. And what do they, what do they do with you? Oh, he did. His name's Vinny shoreman. He's out of the UK. Um, he's actually an announcer for, he's like, probably one of the most active, uh, kickboxing announced. He was in the world, used to do k one and it's showtime. Um, he's been around the kickboxing, you know, for a long, long time. Um, he does all kinds of really cool stuff with me. You know, I didn't want to give away too many secrets, but he can. Um, he does like it hypnosis me sometimes

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       does he live in the UK and he lives in the UK

Speaker 3:          00:35:40       and like he'll hypnotize me through facetime over the phone. I swear to God it happened. And like the first time he did it, like I hit it, he would have been posting and I had heard it and heard about them a little bit and I had had some issues in the past where like my worst performances were not because I didn't train hard, it was a mental thing, you know, and uh, uh, well the first time I started talking to me like one of the hypnotize me and I'm like, okay, yeah, sure. You didn't have a thigh as me. And he's like, okay, I want you to sit down and you know, you're going to start feeling blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And as he's talking, I'm like just quietly with my clothes on with suits, so full of shit, this is not going to work.

Speaker 3:          00:36:14       This is not gonna work, this guy. So dumb. And next thing I know, I'm like, Huh. And uh, you know, it worked immediately and the things that, the little things that he told me to do, I immediately felt a lot better, like a lot better and I could see the difference. My coach could see the difference. And what's his background? Is he a psychologist? Um, I think, I'm not really sure how he got into that. It's a, he does like a lot of seminars and goes to a lot of things and studies, a lot of stuff. I don't really know his, if he went to school for that or what that is, but he's very, very good at what he does. He works with Liam Harrison and he works at Jordan wants and he works with Julie Kitchen. He worked with Andy Housing. Most of like the really high level kickboxers overseas.

Speaker 4:          00:36:51       That's, that's, that is a very important point. You know, and I don't know how many guys utilize a sports psychologist. I know Anderson did a bit for this fight after the Weidman fights

Speaker 3:          00:37:04       portant for him going in, stuff like this. I'm going a lot of guys you like, you bring it up and they can immediately see it as a, as a disadvantage that you even think that you need help or that, you know. But for me, there's so many things, like fans don't understand the amount of pressure that a fighter is under going into a fight and then to go into a fight where the whole world thinks you're going to lose. You know what I mean? You have no chance. Like what? Like me fighting Calculi I think I had nine professional fights and you know, he knocked out mighty Mo and he was a Roger Dubliner and champion at over two.

Speaker 4:          00:37:36       Yeah, we don't, if you don't know who he is, he's a world famous Thai boxer who was about 170 580 pounds, flop mighty moe who was close to 300 pounds at the time and had kicked him and it was just one of those ridiculous k one match ups where they used to do in Japan, they love freak shows. They love to put together no gear versus Bob Sapp or Bob Saps 375 pounds and you know, they put a Bob Sapp versus even crazier. They put Bob Sapp versus Minoa who's like one 85. So you've got to [inaudible] pseudo versus a similar, the Samoan Guy Kinky pseudo also fought, um, fucking the fat guy with the ball. A butter bean. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah. That show is ridiculous that we're talking about more than a 200 pound weight disadvantage and they go on the ground and him on top of you and unbelievable. Unbelievable. Yeah. I mean, but they don't give a fuck. And Japan, they, they want to put on Godzilla versus King Kong. That's what they want to do. They want to have ridiculous matches

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       and I want to watch Godzilla versus king going, you know, I'm into that. You know, sometimes they see like styles make fights and like sometimes it's, I mean obviously you want to see who's the best of the best of the best, but sometimes you want to see these other, you know, these two might not be even in the top 10 but man, they're gonna fucking get down. You know, this is the fight to want to see. Yeah. I mean look Bob Sapp versus Nogueira to me still is one of my favorite all time find it's cause it was so rich. The fact you got pile drive in the first round, which you never see in MMA. It's kind of illegal. It's illegal in the u s at least speaking of illegal. Can we talk about this? Joe? I think we've talked about this. Sure. What's up with all these guys smashing, trying to stomp kick like Anderson did to nick.

Speaker 2:          00:39:14       You know, I kinda Nice. Yeah. I just think it's a little shady that you got to comes off as such a catastrophic injury. And the first thing he does is start stomping away at somebody else's kneecap in a fight. Did you see the, um, the fight with Miguel Torres, the kickboxing fight, the recent Jamie pulled this up. Um, Miguel Torres a need destroyed. You'll, you'll find it. It's legacy. Kickbox it's a probably Gif. You can find it. The gif file of it. It's fucking horrendous. It's the worst one I've ever seen. He does this a, the oblique kick and he does it right to the knee on like the side of his knee. His knee just, you see it get destroyed. I mean, I just don't, I just don't think that's, that's, I don't think it should be illegal. I just don't think he should be. And I'm trying to knock somebody out.

Speaker 2:          00:40:02       I'm not trying to like actually kill them. Right. And finish their career. But I think if you started messing around, because I've had two knee surgeries and had to come back from it, it's just, it bothers me to see somebody intentionally tried to check and knee joint. But what do you think about it then? Again, the arm bar. So what about heal hooks? Like if you see a guy like who's smart? Paul Harris, it was like it's heel hooks specialist. I don't necessarily have a problem with the heel hook. I have a problem with a guy that holds onto the heel hook after you tap multiple times and then intentionally ripped your leg off and then which he's done, which really does, you know, I don't really care for that. Yeah, the helix particularly devastating one. Hang on to it. Like if you hang onto a choke, you put the guy out with folks who don't, who've never trained you, don't like, it's not that bad to get choked unconscious.

Speaker 2:          00:40:47       I know it seems like it would be really bad, but it really is just like a sh. It shuts your brain off and then turns your brain back on again. It's sort of the best way to describe it is like a garden hose. You Pinch a garden hose, it stops the water, and then you let it go and then the water keeps flowing through it. It's not nearly as bad as getting knocked out. So holding onto a choke and putting the Gar unconscious. It's really not that big a deal, but holding onto a heal hook, you tear the ligaments apart and you're talking about a guy who's going to go through six months of Rehab Surgery, the whole deal and then it might not ever be the same thing I hear when you were taken away guys livelihood for over a year most likely just to what be, you know, you already got them to tap or whatever. I just don't particularly go put, highrise is kind of crazy. There's something, something does a little bit of a mental, you

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       know about his, his childhood, right. His whole story is really heart wrenching. I mean he grew up, he was working full time from the time he was like a little boy in a, in a farm. You know that giant scar that he has on his chest. He got that when he was working and he had a crazy glue it together cause like they had no money for food. They had no money for the doctor. Like he, he used to eat pig slop because he had no food. Like he would eat like the food that they would feed pigs. It's a, it's her, it's horrific. So this guy, like he went through some really horrendous shit, like as a child in rural Brazil, you know, in, in intense poverty. So I think it's hard to get through that unscathed. Most certainly hasn't. So I think every fight that he has, man, he's fucking fighting for his life. Right. And if he gets a hold of your leg, he could see this. What's that? It's loading up. Yeah. Look at this. I mean, he caught it sideways to Miguel was a heavy on the front leg and he was almost kinda like stepped in sideways. Oh, the dude caught it like just in the outside. Look at that. Oh my goodness.

Speaker 3:          00:42:46       Oh, I throw it like a similar kick to that where I take the front of my foot and I, it's almost like a slap kick and I do it to the, the Shinbone, but it's, it's not too to injure him, it's to stop his forward momentum. A lot of times when I do that, their head comes forward and I can throw something. But to go directly in the knee joint, I mean that guy through that intentionally to do that. I don't think there's any question that he was trying to buckle his knee like that.

Speaker 4:          00:43:07       Yeah, he did attack in the knee and that's in lookout. Me, he's coming down. Oh yeah. Well it's actually Miguel was stepping forward so his knee was off the mat, like as it landed. See that? Oh, it was kind of touching, but he was coming forward and the guy caught, yeah, see his need came up and he's coming forward and then it just went down on it and just wrenched it across. Oh, it's a horrible to watch. Ooh. And that's, you're out for a year and it might not have it be the same again. If you come back. There are two in this new thing now, man, where they're three d mapping. Um, your meniscus, they're taking this, uh, this thing that they've created. It's like a scaffolding. They three d map, this scaffolding, the insert it where your meniscus is. And it has proteins in your body, builds your own meniscus on it.

Speaker 4:          00:43:56       That's all. So you're going to be able to rebuild your municipal awesome cause you're credible for years. That's been the thing they can, they can't change. If you tear your meniscus like you're screwed. That's really good that they can do that. Well, they've Cartlidge too. They've started to do that with stem cells. They've started to inject stem cells into the area where people are missing cartilage and cars, cartilage regrown which is incredible. Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah. They're doing PRP stuff to where the, uh, when we were with my knee surgeries, they were, uh, thinking about doing that with mine. They didn't do a platelet rich plasma is really cool. And there's another thing that I've been doing called Regena keen and Regena. Amazing. It's

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       the, that's the stuff that was invented by this guy. I'm a doc, I forget his name, but he's in, um, uh, in Germany and he created this, uh, procedure. We take the blood, they pull it out like a lot of blood, and then they spin it in a centrifuge and heat it up. And when they heat it up, it takes, um, the blood and the blood reacts to the heat is if you have a fever and it creates this amazing anti-inflammatory response. This is yellow serum. They pulled his yellow Sierra mountain and they inject it directly into any area where you have an injury and it's like, like platelet rich plasma times a hundred. It's so amazing. That makes sense. It's like a, like the cold laser therapy where they're like light therapy. That's what they do. It means a lot. Yeah. But therapists, you're essentially the, the light or the heat, uh, triggers your body to send more blood and nutrients and heal itself straight.

Speaker 2:          00:45:27       Keeping that stuff up and injecting it back in, you know? Yeah. It's amazing, man. It's amazing science. I've had it done in a bar I've had done on my knee, my neck, my back, my elbow, my shoulder. It's incredible. I've, every time some shit's fucked up on me, I just go right down there and get shot up. That you feel the difference right away? Oh yeah. Man, my knee was fucking with me. I, I've had three knee surgeries and my knee was fucking with me for like the last couple of years. I was like, man, I'm going to have to get this fucking thing scoped again and I get it shot up like five months ago. Nothing, squats, kickboxing, nothing. Just never fucked with me anymore. It's weird. It's amazing. So they can do incredible shit now with medicine and science. Thank God there's so many egg heads out there that are just fucking pounding on the keyboards and you know, doing it in the lab and trying to reengineer human beings.

Speaker 2:          00:46:14       It's amazing. It's like what Anderson and the and Tyrone Spong that break like 15 years ago, they would have like amputated your leg. Like it would have just been, that would have been that really me. Yeah. Somebody was telling me that they used to amputate leg if the leg snapped and like the, yeah, they were, they said they would amputate. But yeah, because of the, the something about the tissue or something. Just 15 years ago, something like that. Yeah. That's hard to believe, but don't quote me on that. But yeah, that's what I heard. Somebody might align with some bright light to me. I'm pretty gullible. Well, they probably used to have to like Joe my line to us. All right now by this gold stuff there, the re-injecting, I don't know man. I've, that stuff's a Dana white is the one who told me about it.

Speaker 2:          00:46:56       He, uh, he had it done for his ministers disease. He disease is something you have in the inner ear and it would, it was fucking with him his whole life. He had surgery to try to fix it and he, uh, he got shot up with this, uh, the Regena Canon just bang, gone, just goes away. I wonder if that would have helped nick. Nick a herd is a left elbow. Hyperextended his left elbow and we were training like maybe three or four weeks before the fight and uh, it really started messing with them like the week before the fight. And, uh, we were in Vegas and as manager actually hit called Dana to find out what doctor or whatever to go to, to get him a cortisone shot into his elbow. And, uh, like you wouldn't mean nick won't even take Ibuprofen. I was like, dude, take some Ibuprofen.

Speaker 2:          00:47:40       He uh, I think it was about, um, when he used to cut really easily back in the day, I'll be proven is like a blood thinner sorta thing or something that he makes him bleed more or whatnot. But um, yeah, he was having like he would, we were walking around the hotel and like if his arm would lock out and like he would have to wait a second for it to like click back. So it was TCIS Christ. Yeah. Then you're going into a fight where you're boxing is your, your strong suit and you don't feel really comfortable throwing your left hand. So that's ridiculous. But yeah, I wonder if that gold stuff for the helped. Yeah, but you got through it. I mean he landed some good shots with it so he definitely did well once I had adrenaline starts flowing. Yeah, that's what I was telling him.

Speaker 2:          00:48:18       Like you're not going to think about that when, when you're out there. You know, the Regena keen thing is all the rage, like all the basketball players to Coby. Brian gets it done. All these different guys get it done. Guys were flying over to Germany to do it, but now they have an office in Santa Monica and I think they have an office in Dallas I think as well. They have a couple of them that they're opening up I think might be opening up one in Vegas, but they're opening up all over the country because the response is amazing. That's nuts. Yeah. We live in a weird time. Science is amazing. It really is. I just got done today. I was doing cryotherapy if you'd done that yet. I haven't done it. I wanted to go to one,

Speaker 3:          00:48:52       especially after the last man standing tournament. My entire body was messed up. I had this, uh, it's still kind of messes with me a little bit now. But somehow along the line of the three nights, three fights, I got hit in the chest with something. I want to say it was probably Simon with one of those knees. But, uh, my whole body hurt. And then as the swelling and everything started going down, my fucking chest just started killing your sternum and it was like, then I noticed I had like this ball, it was literally like a size of like a tennis ball on, on my chest is still square is up a little bit now. But it swelled up so much that it pinched off all the nerves in my chest and my arm would like, I'd have like a stingers all the way down my arm and I'd wake up, I mean for the first like week or two after the fight, I was like waking up in the middle of the night, like shaking.

Speaker 3:          00:49:37       I would get a fever cause it wasn't so much pain from the scenario stuff. And uh, I guess I got like multiple X-rays, thought my sternum was broken, couldn't figure it out, wasn't there was no break and they said it was basically like, uh, you know, these, you see these guys when they get hit in the face or hit in the head and they get these hematomas on their head and it's just blood and crap that's stuck between the skin. And the bone, what mine was, I guess inside of the cartilage of my rib or whatever. And you know, even for the moment by when I would be training Jiu Jitsu or it'd be working on my chokes or somebody puts their weight on my chest, like it would swell up afterwards. So I was taking Ibuprofen by like the handful of there for a minute. But it's doing a lot better now.

Speaker 2:          00:50:15       Yeah, the, the crown therapy would probably helped out a little bit, but I think that's just one of those things it's going to yield to the crowd. Therapy is awesome for recovery. Yeah, it's amazing. I do ice baths. I mean, I think the cryotherapy so much shorter, it like a lot cooler, a

Speaker 4:          00:50:27       lot shorter, and apparently a lot more effective because you're going 250 degrees below zero for three minutes. Then you get out, you get on an elliptical machine, you warm your body back up and then boom, right back in for another three minutes. What's that feeling, dude? It feels amazing. You get out of there, you feel like you could fucking jump over the moon. It's amazing. There's such a Wa it's wild. Like if you could take that in a pill form, people would just be fucking chewing on him all day because most people are scared of the feeling like fucking 253 it's really not that bad. It's really not. It just kind of stand there. I mean, I'm not, I don't even freak out. It just kind of move around a little. It hurts my nipples. So I covered my nipples up when I do it. I don't know why.

Speaker 4:          00:51:05       I don't want my nipples to fall off. Not that I use them or anything. They're pretty numb anyway, but they, uh, that's the only thing that starts to like, feel like really bad. You'd legs get super cold towards the end, but it's just three minutes, you know, he's just kinda deal with it for three minutes and then he'd get out and you, as soon as you get out, you're like, Woo. As soon as your body realizes it's back in room temperature. Well the blood, apparently the science behind it is that your body real thanks. This motherfucker's gonna die. Okay. You just, somebody just dropped you off at the top of the world and it's a zero degrees below zero and you fucking you, you're going to die within moments. So your body's all the blood to your or to your organs, try to protect your organs and then once you get back to room temperature, it pushes it all out and it creates this amazing anti-inflammatory effect, like all the soreness that you have and just, it just does a weird thing to your body.

Speaker 4:          00:51:54       But the energy that you get out of it, I dunno, I dunno if it's an adrenaline rush of your body, realizes like, hey, we're not going to die. Life is beautiful. Look, the sun is shining. I'm alive. You know, it's like when those things where they say you don't really appreciate piece unless you've experienced war, you don't appreciate love unless the experience, hey, you don't know how beautiful it is to be able to walk down the street and not freeze your Dick off until you're in tied one of those booze. But there's a lot of physical effects. We can try that. That sounds really cool. You can research it online, like all the different, the like what they know about the actual biochemical effect that it has on your body. But people swear by it. Like, again, like basketball players, MMA fighters like Allen, Joe Ban, uh, who's a, one of our guys at 10th Plan and he's in there every day. Eddie Bravo does it every day. It's just, it's amazing when he was training for the boiler fight too, especially, he was in there every day. It's just, it's amazing. It just, it just makes you recover quicker. But the feeling you get out of it. I love the best. I will walk out of there. It's like your whole body feels alive. It's wild. Yeah. He wouldn't, you come back, let me know. I'll, I'll take you down there. Yeah, definitely introduce you to those guys. Cool.

Speaker 3:          00:53:01       Science actually with, um, with like cold therapy, uh, after the last men standing tournament. I was thinking about doing it. I just didn't, I didn't, I don't know why I didn't end up doing it, but Nike makes a cooling vest that uh, it's basically like the, as all of these pockets or are we out of his pockets in it and uh, it keeps you like really cool. So I was thinking after the fight of putting that on because I found out that like 70%, again, don't quote me on these numbers, but 75% of the your your energy system misspent on temperature regulation. So like if you had to have multiple fights in one night, you know, how much time are you wasting sitting in the back sweating and the you're wasting energy that you need later on in the fights. We were thinking about trying to put, um, to use that, that cold pack or were those a cooling vest? I think Nike came out with it for the Beijing Olympics.

Speaker 4:          00:53:51       That's a great idea. You have two fights this weekend? No, I just have one.

Speaker 3:          00:53:55       Which honestly it seems like, you know, my coaches, I was like, Holly and my cardio is not quite as good as I thought it was. And he's like, you only get a fight once. I was like, oh, all right. Yeah. It's hard to compare because when you get and such, I mean I was in phenomenal shape for that, for that last men standing tournament. I think I had like, we found out about that fight I think four or five months in advance and it was going pretty hard for it the whole time. And uh,

Speaker 4:          00:54:16       now when you have a camp like that, like who, who like who structures you can't, but who structures like how much running you do, how much strength and conditioning you do, how much kickboxing, how much striking with on the pads, how many, like how do you, how do you structure your workouts? Um, my coach,

Speaker 3:          00:54:32       we'll do that, but um, have the, for that camp it was like, okay. Cause we had just came back from the Wayne Barrett fight where he just seemed like a lot bigger than me. So it was like, you know, I was fighting at one 75 before I signed with glory. And then when I went to the Gloria, it was automatically up to like one 87 and [inaudible] 86. And uh, you know, the glory tinned tournament arts and 11 wasn't very big guy in English and music worked out really well for me, so I thought I was good at that, at that size. And then with Wayne Barrett, he was just so massive. Like he's just a big guy, you know, and uh, so I wanted to put on some muscle. So we did a lot of strength conditioning. Just I was doing like, uh, every day, sometimes twice a day I was doing, I'm going to La fitness with my buddy and doing like a body strictly bodybuilding stuff, no cardio, just uh, I was taking, I think he was shooting for like 3,500 calories a day, which is just, I would feel lethargic and just exhausted all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:55:26       And I did that for a few for a few months. I think I got up to about two 15, which was really big for me at the time. And then the last, I think it was probably the last like five weeks, I stopped with the strength conditioning was just focused on speed and trying to get, trying to get used to that size that I was and I trimmed down quite a bit, but um, it was like build the muscle bulk up and then get fast and loose and then go into the tournament and then my cardio and my speed and everything kind of comes in the last four weeks.

Speaker 4:          00:55:55       Yeah. Some guy, there's a lot of guys who like to do that for MMA. Like they take off from a fight and then once they're done they get out of camp before they saved. They know they have a five, four or five months away. They'll do nothing but strength and conditioning, no fight training, no sparring, you know, know getting hit, no grappling. They just lifting weights and just like jumping boxes and doing all kinds of pliers and shit like that.

Speaker 3:          00:56:17       That was the first time I'd ever done that, that I really focused on the strength and conditioning stuff. And then when I did start, um, when I stopped with that and I started doing the runs and stuff, uh, nick was actually in town and we went for a long run at Venice beach. I think we were at Ronda as house that day. And we went for like this long run and we did like six mile run and I felt really good. And then I was like, hey, let's, let's hit these sprints on the way back and there's like bathroom, and then it's like 200 yards, even another bathroom or whatever. And he's like, okay, we'll run to that, to that next. Uh, the next bathroom we'll split. And like, I couldn't, I was just in shocked at how many gears I had. I was like, I'd never ran that fast ever in my whole life.

Speaker 3:          00:56:55       And it was, we had really, it was the difference of that time that I had booked up and really worked on the strength conditioning and then the period of, of cutting down and getting, leaning, getting fast again. And I was just very, very explosive. And it was, it was really good sign. I smoked Nikkia you listen to this, Nick beat you. That's, that's interesting. So this is like that's a direct result of all the weightlifting and all the put on muscle and strength. That was the first time I really noticed a big difference cause I always really hit hard. I mean I think I've always hit really hard. Um, but that was, that was something I really noticed was my, my explosiveness out of my legs was, it was definitely a lot better. It's weird that for fighters it seems like every training camp is almost like a science project.

Speaker 3:          00:57:39       What you're trying to figure out what is the right mixture and also back to the mental thing. I think that that's um, you know, I always say like, I'm trying to get like the tip of like an Arrow, you know what I mean? Each fight, I get it kind of closer to that and then you know, you, you make a mistake or whatever. I'm trying to get to the pinnacle of like mentally focused, you know what I'm saying? The perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect edge. Do I get too pumped up before I, if I was at too cold, was I flat? Was I thinking about the right things? And you know, that's what my mind coach really helps me is there's so many things going on in my head and he just tells me the right things to think. And you know, a lot of it is also like the way you, the way you talk to yourself or about yourself, the way you describe yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:58:20       You know, I used to say stuff like, uh, you know, I have really good punches but my kids aren't that good. And he told me like, Hey, you got to stop saying that stuff. I'm like, well, my kicks were there aren't that good and well, you kind of self, uh, self sabotage yourself. You, you only allow yourself to get as good as you, you talk about yourself. That makes sense at all. Uh, define you. Define Yourself. That's why I call it like mint, like mind coaching instead of like psychological, you know, psychologist or whatever. It's just like my coach tells me, Hey, you're dropping your hands or you're doing this or doing that, or you need to focus on this, this and this. My mind coach is doing the same thing. And I think that like the, I don't know, I think everything is really come, um, the stars, so to speak, of all kind of aligned for me in the last, last couple of years. You know, I feel like I'm, I'm at an age now, I'm just turning 31, although I guess I can't change my Wikipedia page now. Why was it say it says I'm 31 I was going to change it to like 26. I don't do it. It's a slippery slope. I know guys that are

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       40 something they'd tried to stay there 30. Yeah, it's fucking ridiculous. I think, you know, I've reached an age and my career where I just, uh, I'm a lot more mature. I'm a lot better athlete, you know, it seems like everything's kind of lining up now. And I have the right coaches behind me. I built with my coach Mark Comoros and so I was a, so it was fighting an amateur fights, you know, he's taken me throughout my whole career, so that's great. Well that's a guy who knows you really well done. The Yard in ll where? Where's the yard? Uh, it's in Lincoln Heights, right? Announced right outside. It's on the Avenue 26. It's right where the five and the one team, one 10 meat. So it was like downtown area. That's basically downtown. Is it? Oh, that's a bitch to get to it. It the fucking traffic's a, I kind of live in that general area.

Speaker 2:          01:00:02       Like I live in Alhambra, like South Pasadena area, so it's not too bad for me. I was living in downtown for a long time and then my, uh, my son started going to schools and I was like, you know, I'd rather have him in a little bit of a school system. So yeah, the best school system we could, you know, the best school system I think is like a orange county, but we couldn't quite, didn't quite work out for the best one we could find was Alhambra, which is like South Pasadena is really nice quiet area man. I love it there. Pasadena was like apparently back in the day when Hollywood was sorta first created in the 20s or whatever, the uh, the stars would fucking booze it up and do blow in the Hollywood hills and the producers are like, let me get the fuck Outta here. And then they set up shop in Pasadena.

Speaker 2:          01:00:44       That's why she didn't go by Pasadena. There's these giant estate to house man. Got Some amazing houses in Pasadena. I fucking love Pasadena. Yeah, it's nice. There's some, there's a gem. Isn't there like a sit you'll tongue, you're talking as a Pasadena? Yeah. It's got a kickboxing gym isn't around for a long time. We tie. Yeah. Yeah. La is a weird spot where you would think there'd be a lot more like top level MMA gyms in this area when there are, yeah. There really is a, you know, there wasn't a whole lot it's written like in Hollywood, it was like legends. It was like the only MMA gym for a long, long time. Yeah. And uh, yeah, who legends went under and then you know, you've got some stuff down in Orange County. Of course you've got rain, you've got kings, but yeah, Timo Yama. But there's no like Jackson's MMA, he got like world champions training in one facility that's like this center spot.

Speaker 2:          01:01:37       It's almost seems like for a lot of places, like it might actually be better to be in a small town and bring the guys in and then of course you're going to have less distractions and less bullshit if that happens. Right. But la doesn't have a lot of great kickboxing either. There's not a lot of different spots for as many peoples. There are 20 million people. Yeah. When I moved out here from Ohio, it was to pursue kickboxing. It was because uh, Los Angeles and California was the like, uh, the, uh, center for kickboxing in this country, you know. Um, it was the only show that only played with him. But I was moved out here when I was 19. Um, they were the only ones putting on a sanctioned Muay Thai fights was Dennis Warner and vote vote promotions. And

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       uh, but there's a really good gyms in, um, in Van Nuys there's, there's a really good gym and um, north Hollywood, two or three in north Hollywood, there's a Santa Clarita has got really good gym. So, you know, I think that, um, there's a lot of of Moyie Thai here in southern California and I think that's, you know, when I was fighting it and amateurs and smokers and, and um, the smaller shows here in California, it was, it was the amateur was a very high level, you know, very high level. And, uh, I only had, I had, uh, I was 23 and one is an amateur and

Speaker 4:          01:02:56       most of those were smokers, just local amateur fights before Wipro. So many Jujitsu schools here. That's what reduction Jesse's, it's crazy here. Right? It's amazing. When you compare Jujitsu to all the other martial arts is may be like, it's almost like 10 to one is like how many Jujitsu gems and then world class, you know Hickson's here, crones here, John Joc Machado's got to gyms here. He gets got a gym here. It's like on and on and on. You can keep going over and over and over this so many fucking worldclass Jujitsu schools here because Brazilians, they like the song and they want to be near the beach. You know, it's like this is the spot that gravitate to this. Agree with them. It's amazing how much that's changed in this country. You know, when I first started training in [inaudible] 96 there was a small handful of black belts in the country.

Speaker 4:          01:03:42       There was just not that many like worldclass places to train. Now they're everywhere. Every city you go to, there's a legit black belt that's teaching classes and you know, there's places that have hens. I was kind of like 500 plus students in New York City. You know that in New York City's another hotbed. It's like, you know, there's Hendo and Marcello Garcia and you know, on and on and on, you can just keep going. There's just so many gems there. But when it comes to a place where you have like a legit worldclass MMA training facility, like an Aka, you know, there's still not that many of them. Right. You know, and especially when you look at California, you would think, man, you know, this is like so much kickboxing, so much Jujitsu, so much MMA, like you know, are so much, uh, you know, so many fighters but not like one, like it's a big central spot.

Speaker 3:          01:04:33       And then the ones that it's like, it must like, you like team Timo, you has got like Ian and, and most of their, their team has, I was a lot smaller, you know what I mean? I was going there for a long time and he's trained with Shane del Rosario, um, before he passed away. And, uh, after he was gone, there wasn't a whole lot of guys my size down there.

Speaker 4:          01:04:49       So that's an issue for bigger guys to write big, especially for heavyweights. It's really hard for heavyweights to find good training partners and find a skillful guy that's above 225 pounds. It's just, it's not that many. Right. I think alliance has got a good, it's a good team. Dumb Go. Right. They're pretty good guys. They got some good guys, you know, of course a Aka has called me a and a and cane. There's a, there's some good guys there. I called him and doing really well. It leads to, yeah, yeah. Rock holds a beast. Yeah. This, uh, this is an interesting time because people are still trying to figure out how to train correctly for MMA. You know, it's like you've got a lot of guys that are still holdovers from the early days where they would get together and try to figure it out and slug it out.

Speaker 4:          01:05:33       And there was a lot of like unnecessarily hard sparring or unless they're a hard not smart sparring and then, you know, people were still trying to figure out like what's the best way to go about it. And then you have people that have figured it out, like the Aka sort of figured it out or the American top teams where they have it down to a science, you know, but there's just not that many. Whereas like if you look at any other major sport, look at baseball or football, like they have protocols like strength and conditioning protocols. We put all their athletes through and there's been programs cause they'd go through from high school to college to the pros. Like they, they know like state of the art. This is what we're supposed to do. This is the best way to recover. This is the best way to start to train strength and conditioning. This is the best way to do this with MMA also, there's so many skills, there's so many things to learn. It's like, it's one of the most interesting things about MMA, but it's also one of the things like, man, what do you concentrate on?

Speaker 3:          01:06:28       Uh, that's a really good point. You know, with me transitioning over to them and May, it's, it's, uh, it's one thing I'm really enjoying is there's so much, you know, never done kickboxing for so long where, you know, I don't know everything there is to know about kickboxing, but I feel very at home and if I get in good shape and my coaches are just sharpening me of, uh, keeping me fresh, I think I can get it in a kickboxing fight and, uh, just react naturally, you know? And with him it may, it's still, I'm still learning and still thinking about things. And a lot of times I remember what I was supposed to do, like 10 seconds after, you know, I got tapped out, I should've done this or did that, you know, so, but it's a lot of fun to, uh, to be evolving and keep learning new things for me, you know, and there's so much stuff to learn and so many different styles and different ways to win. And that's when really beneficial for me working with nick and Nate as they think about it. So, so analytically, you know, like, Oh, you know, going on top, going on bottle, I'm like, if this doesn't work out, then you're ended up here. And you know, it's uh, it's really interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:07:24       D is it difficult cause you're doing both? He just fought Melvin Manhoef in a big a MMA fight in Bellator and then you go on from that and a couple months later you're finding in a big kickboxing event. Is it difficult to do both at the same time? I'm, I'm going to find out, you know, uh, I right now it's, it's, uh, I'm living the dream. I feel like I can be really successful in both right now depending on the, the right match ups, you know, I don't think, um, you know, I don't think I'm going to a contender for a title in MMA just yet. Um, but, uh, yeah, it's uh, you know, there's things I have to remember not to do, uh, for both. You know what I mean? If I knock somebody down in new and May, I don't walk away and write eight count. Mark Hunt, he's the king of the walkaway Kao in MMA.

Speaker 2:          01:08:10       It was funny when I knocked out with Melvin, um, I felt the walkaway like I needed to do though I knew it was out, but, um, my coaches and my coach and my manager were very adamant that that the night of the fight and then like the week of that, like this isn't, this isn't kickboxing, there isn't going to be an eight count. If you drop him, make sure you go over my, finish him, you know, like you need to finish right away. And so like I hit him with like the hook cross w I didn't even know I hit him with the left hand. I thought he, I thought it was just the right hand until I saw the video. And, uh, I saw him go down and you know, he's going down with his hands up and I'm like one of to walk away and then like, there's like this voice in my head, like, oh, finish golfing.

Speaker 2:          01:08:45       And yet, and I went to, went to go in and uh, uh, Mike Belcher had jumped in the way and then I was just like, ugh, totally ruined my walk up and just walked off. Right. Yeah. Pull that up. Jimmy Joe Schilling. Kaos Melvin Manhoef. That was a big fight for you because there's been that that Guy Melvin Manhoef, his um, his style is terrifying. Like people are terrified of that guy because first of all, he's black as coal. He looks like a fucking superhero. He comes out throwing bombs, knocked out, Mark Hunt with one punch. I mean, he's a terrifying and it's strikes like 12 minutes long.

Speaker 5:          01:09:25       Everybody. Like the week of the fight, everyone's like Joe Shillings fighting this guy and they tag me in it. Like every time I checked Facebook or Instagram or Twitter, it was like people reminding me that I'm fighting, you know, this guy. And it was just like knockout, knockout, knockout. You know, he's got the highlight reel of death. Yeah, he's a, it was a really big fight for me. It was a really tough fight from me to, you know, I had a, it was a really bad camp. It was probably the worst camp. My career, my dad had passed away like three weeks before the fight. Then like two or three days after that. Why does that look so shitty, Jamie? My cousin passed away so it was

Speaker 2:          01:09:57       pull it back. So is it our computer that's doing that? It's drags cause the computer. Why is it, but come on man. This is fucking, it's a youtube video. Is it really that bad? What do we got to do to fix that? Tell him whatever we have to do to fix that. Let's fucking fix that. Cause this is pissing me off. This looks like shit. Can't even see it. Boom. Damn. There's that dude's been flatlined a bunch of times over the last few years. It's a those Dutch guys. A lot of fucking tough guys in Holland. Man. Lot of tough kickboxers in Holland. It's like, I think of them almost like a kamikaze fighter. It's either like can be killed, but that's why I'm a fan of it. You know? Who doesn't want to watch a moment, man. I'll fuck. Yeah, no, I'm a huge fan. Mike's gym producing some goddamn savages.

Speaker 2:          01:10:44       Bought her Hari. He's a God damn savage to what did, what is he doing these days? Is he going to jail again or what's happening? Sure. Out what his, uh, his, uh, what that situation is. But I think he's based training for a fight. I think he's fighting in a global fighting, um, championships and Russia or somewhere now these, and I was fighting glory. He's, I don't think that'll hasn't glory get that guy. I asked myself the same question. Fun heavyweight. He's a fun heavyweight guys. One of my all time favorites. So yeah, that dude's a mad. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure he's going to pass any piss tests, but he's a, he's a mad dog and a lot of fun to watch that. That's kickboxing scene is not one for Piss test. So yeah, that's, that's one good way of putting it. I think America's the only country in the world that really drug tests their athletes.

Speaker 2:          01:11:32       You know, especially with fighting, you know, I don't think that there's any drug testing and you know, one's are paying. There was definitely in the drug that was in Japan. They drug test you to make sure you're doing steroids to make sure you're doing yeah. Make sure I have a friend who, uh, was, uh, it was a natural, I mean he should have been fine. One 55 and uh, he was going over to Japan and they wanted him to fight one 85. Yeah. They were like, you know, you're a big guy. Let's do some juice. Let's get you pumped up. And he was like, what? He leads used to deal with American promoters where they never said that. Then they sat, they sat them down and flew him out there, sat them down and they essentially told him to get on steroids. What did he do?

Speaker 2:          01:12:08       He did. He did. He wound up finding an America, but he went over there, you know, and had the meeting and he had one fight over there and they, you know, they liked him but they wanted him to go up. Think he fought over there at one 60 and they, uh, they wanted them to fight one 85. Like what the fuck are you guys talking about? I mean, it's one thing if you're like, you're a big guy already and they're like, oh, we want me to go up and wait. So yeah, you're really good. But uh, we want you to put on 20 pounds of muscle on fight. Well, I think in Japan they feel like the larger weight classes are the ones that sell the most. And I think that was their, their, their thought process. He's a good looking guy. They feel like this guy give, put them, puts a big muscles on him, we're going to make some money.

Speaker 2:          01:12:49       You know, they're definitely not thinking like, Hey, for your career, this is the best move. Right? Or your safety. Well, you hear those stories about the Yakuza back in their pride. Glory days, giving you bowling ball bags filled with money. I heard a few stories like that. They show up at a, you know your hotel room the night before the fight with like grocery shop. Yeah. Bags full of money. What guys? I'm take them back with them. They would be taping rolls of money to their body because you're going to take $10,000 or something back. So they'd be literally taping stacks of money to their body to try to get through security voice had like every member of his entourage had to hold like $10,000 to go on the plane to go back after. Yeah, but try explaining that. So you traveled with this dude and he's got 10 grand to and this guy, well no coincidence.

Speaker 2:          01:13:34       She's got 10 grant. How's this going to have 10 grand to what did you guys do? Fucking find some money over there. Like what the hell happened in Japan? No taxes for that. The glory days. It's a, that's a beautiful thing about this sport though, that the glory days were only like a decade ago. Right. You know, it's like, it's so young, 22 years since the UFC was first created, it's hard to believe and that those guys in the glory day are still competing now. You have a lot of them. Yeah. So is your plan to see glory days and you're fighting and glory? I would love it if glory became really successful because I'm a huge fan kickboxing,

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       but I don't know. I mean how, how successful was their pay per view venture? Uh, the piggery venture, I didn't think, I don't think I did very good at all. Um, but I think it was more about us, like a, a strategic thing. Like if you give away your product for free all the time, then it's, it's hard to ever establish, okay, now you have to pay for it. And you know, so I think they did that as more of like, it needed to do a pay per view, but they're put repeat buys weren't that great. Which I think was kind of unfortunate because that was like the end all be all for a combat sports in one night. You know, you gotta put that on Spike TV. I think that would have done huge numbers for building their brand, but they had a great, you know the other thing they did on that was they had two cards one at one time, so you have, you know, cro cop was the main event on the, on the card at that was live on spike TV and I think it's just hard to get people, I mean I love kickboxing, but I'm not going to watch it for an hour and a half and then pay another 60 bucks to watch it for another hour and a half hours a night.

Speaker 3:          01:15:07       You know? I think that was just a, well they tried the UFC, the strategy, the way the UFC has the prelims on Fox sports one and they have the main boughts on paper view afterwards. They tried that strategy, but the UFC, it's just way more established. I think it's really hard to do that with kickboxing because for the most part, most of the people that are watching have no idea who anybody fighting is. Right. So you watch now shilling except Joe Schilling and uh, whoever he fights. But if you watch the UFC, you're, you're, they're prepping you for the big stars. But they haven't really established Gloria enough to have big stars yet. But man, I level of kickboxing is so high and it's, it's, it's got a frustrating because you know, for the, for the, uh, what do you call like the, the new fan.

Speaker 3:          01:15:53       Even for him, it may, you know, you still get people like all, what's this boring stuff on the ground that don't appreciate the sport. They just want to see the, you know, the action or whatnot. Like those people need to tune into kickboxing. You know, those people need to eat paint rep, they all need to eat, lead, paint, go fuck themselves. It's just so many, this whole fans, that's the one thing that does disappoints me so bad. When I go on Twitter and I read like a fighter will post something, you know, after the fight and you read all the people talking shit about them and just oh, fucking rice to man, there are so many douche bag and it's, it's kind of worse for him and May, you know, uh, yeah, obviously like there was a lot more exposure from my fight with, um, with Melvin.

Speaker 3:          01:16:35       You know, I always knew that there was a bigger fan base for MMA then there was a kickboxing, but I had no idea how much bigger it was. You know, when I won the glory a glory 10, that was the first American to ever win a global combat tournament ever. And uh, it was like a huge deal. It was the biggest pay day I think of American kickboxing history. And I think there was like three stories down on me about it total. And then my fight with Melvin was, uh, you know, it wasn't for title or for ranking and you know, it was just the one fight. And you know, it's, it's been all kinds of publicity and more following from that. But like within like two days, there was people on

Speaker 2:          01:17:09       my Instagram like just writing the most degrading, disrespectful shit about like my family and my mom and my just ridiculous stuff. And then, uh, so you know, you get more fans, you get more in a whack jobs, but there definitely seems to be a little bit more um, ignorant fans that did hang out trash and people and even may, there's just so many dummies in this world to get Terry, right? Yeah. And they have, they have an outlet to reach you. Where's before, you know, they would just be yelling at each other at the gas station. You know, they're going to go into a wall. He ain't going to hold our kicking [inaudible] ass. And that's where it would end right now. These, these delicate tweet directly at me, they have an Instagram and they get on your page and you should leave these posts. You read them, you just go, fuck man.

Speaker 2:          01:17:52       Imagine if, you know, someone came from another planet and they were trying to understand what people were like and they read comments on Instagram, right. They'd be like, well, we got a nuke, this fucking thing. Nuke this thing from orbit. It'd be like, like that movie aliens. I've got a new kit for more, but just to be sure like these assholes, these guys have bombs and missiles and this is the way they think, you know? It's not indicative of the, the best example of humanity, especially combat sports. There's something about fighting, well, it kind of sports in general, man, I've been, I'm not a sports fan. I don't pay attention to football or baseball, but every now and then I will read like comments, sections on blogs just to see like if they're the same as like, and it's the same shit. Same Shit. What's up?

Speaker 2:          01:18:38       Yeah. He got a seven in the morning and that's a desperado cocaine move. I test that motherfucker immediately fired from ESPN. Did they fire up immediately fired from ESPN. That's hilarious. That's hilarious. Did she give him a raise? At least she's not raping anybody. It's trying to get a hook is trying to pay for it. Give the man a break. Ugh. That's the worst possible. Like what? What could be worse than that? Prostitution was getting caught picking up prostitutes. They shouldn't even be a big deal. That's the guy's trying to get a massage on his dick. That's all it is. I mean, look, if, if it's seven o'clock in the morning, he was trying to get a massage. Nobody would bat an eye. You're trying to get somebody to touch you for money. That's what it is, but oh no, they're touching the bath. Bought the Nadia.

Speaker 2:          01:19:22       Ooh, this is crazy. You know if you had, if you paid a woman to the sock on the back of your neck, nobody. We'd be like, ah, okay. Yeah. I paid her 1000 bucks a suck on the back of my neck. People would be like, okay, all right, we'll get an that's seems okay. We checked the rules. That's all right, but I paid her to suck my Dick. Fuck it. Why did you say, why would you do that? You're fire. It feels good. What did I do wrong? I don't know. She needed 1000 bucks. I need a blow job. Who got hurt here? I'm so fucking confused. Well, the sponsors, the sponsors won't tolerate it. Joe Schilling, we need to sell Gatorade. We're not selling blowjobs. It's fucking ridiculous. It is fucking, we live in a goofy, goofy babyworld.

Speaker 4:          01:20:09       This is an infant tile world guy gets arrested. Fucking soliciting prostitution. Who's was, did he hit up a cop or something? I don't know that I had heard the whole story. I was hoping you knew. Do you know what happened? Jamie? You should know you're the gossip monger. He admitted to, I guess the girls said that, uh, he was assaulting them two girls. Oh. And then when the cops came for that, he admitted to the solicitation of prostitution, but not the, not the assault. Oh, so he's a douchebag. All right. I take it back. Yeah. She know what man, if, if there was like a legit establishment where he could go to and just give them money and it just, to me, look, I have daughters and the last thing I would ever want is my daughters to be prostitutes. However, I believe that part of our issue that we have as human beings with prostitution, it's just this weird puritan view of sex that sex is somehow or another this forbidden evil thing.

Speaker 4:          01:21:03       It's just two people touching each other's bodies. No babies are getting eaten, you know, and then no fucking slaves are getting whipped. No one's getting tossed off cliffs. This is not a horrible thing. It's fine if you do it for free, right? No one has any problem if you have sex for free. The idea that if you give someone money and you have sex all of a sudden is this terrible, awful evil thing. I think that's stupid. I think it's stupid and it's, it's archaic in this world that we live in is changing and people are starting to realize that adult human being, look, you got a fucking hundred years on this planet if you're lucky. That's it. It's just this wild ride of good times and hopefully friends and good food and lump wonderful life experiences and who the fuck is anybody to tell you that paying for sex or someone paying you for sex is bad?

Speaker 4:          01:21:59       I mean, who is that? Who are those people? But those are the same assholes to tell you shouldn't pay for weed. He shouldn't be able to smoke weed. The same assholes that tell you you shouldn't be able to do psychedelics or you shouldn't be able to whatever the fuck it is, if it's not hurting anything, Nancy graces of the world. That's it. That's it. Did you see her have a interview with two Chainz? Oh my God, I was so like, first of all, someone stole one of two chains chains, cause he only had one chain on. I was getting the whole video. I was like, where's the other chain? Motherfuckers got one chain. You can't call yourself two chains and have a fucking debate on CNN. Sir. You need to use your goddamn birth name. All right, I need to see it. Fucking birth certificate, driver's license, two Chainz, two chains. You know, I'm not, not, my name's is Joe Schilling. It's crazy donkey. You know, if, what would your rap name be? What would that wrap? Maybe? I Dunno. Would it just be, this is can't stop crazy. I guess. So this cancer, what did, where that slogan can't stop crazy come from? That actually came from a, I think it was my second pro Muy Thai fight. I just kind of went berserk and uh,

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       with elbows and knees and one of the guys that train in my gym was like, aw, you know, you can't stop crazy. And I just remember thinking that it was the dumbest thing I've ever heard at the time. Dude. Later on. Um, uh, there was a time when before glory, before lion fight got a TV deal, there was a kickboxing and the shoulder shows that I was fighting on. The fans didn't really have any connection to any one of the fighters unless you went to every show. So there was, it was really hard to set yourself apart as you know, the high level guy or the better guy, like who was really doing it, you know, because there was no media in bottle and uh, me and like the other, um, five or six best kick boxers and the United States got together and started like our own website and started promoting ourselves.

Speaker 3:          01:23:51       And we are got, are the best photographers in the sport and kind of just built our own media for ourselves. And um, you know, eventually lion fight gone, got a TV deal and um, you know, glory came, but for a long time it was just us kind of making it for ourselves. And we're like, what do we call it? And it was like, oh, can't stop crazy. Okay, that's cool. There's kind of a movement. It really kind of took off. It's, it's weird. I can't even describe what it is now. People always ask me to describe it. It's just a group of people that, uh, we sell t shirts and we used to, uh, do our own interviews and with no TV backing, you know, there was nobody promoting us. You know, these are the shirts right here. Some

Speaker 4:          01:24:29       you could wear this, this is 100% douche free. No one would have any idea. Note the lack of skulls. Yup. There's no swords going through a broken skull with a snake wrapped around it. There's no pit bulls getting fucked in the ass by a dragon. It's still actually a juror. If you're listening or designer, I would like a shirt

Speaker 3:          01:24:49       made with a pimple getting fucked in the ass by a dragon

Speaker 4:          01:24:53       in glitter glitter and that's going to be the Joe Rogan show. Some Japanese foil writing behind,

Speaker 3:          01:24:59       you know? Yeah. I don't know man.

Speaker 4:          01:25:02       The uh, the world of [inaudible] dropped off pretty quick. I remember that was like, I wonder why Ed Hardy was like, it was like a, what was it? It was like von Dutch for people with head injuries. Yeah. It was like, you know, people like by von Dutch. It's just fucking too clever for me. I mean, you think, what do you think really started that downfall for them? Was it the whole Kogan show where he wore, they call Kogan was like their poster boy for it and then they kind of, I think it's just overexposure anytime things get, I mean, people love those old school Americana Tattoos, which to me, that's what Ed hardy always used to represent. Like it was kind of cool. Those old like sailor tattoos, like dough. I liked those and then flip it, dazzled the shit out of it. Yeah. Then it was like, what is going on here? And then it became this weird, it was like a von Dutch thing. Like von Dutch used to be the fucking shit. Ashton Kutcher, we used to wear the stupid trucker hats and everybody was like, man, I gotta get one yet. And I would look at it, I was like, what the fuck are you wearing man, that looks like you wearing like some diner in like Cincinnati. They have like a hat

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       that they sell, you know? That's what it looked like. You know what I mean? Like it's just some obscure like truck stop diner, you know? And then all of a sudden all these people were wearing it like that, you know, full tilt it to soil. I'm crazy. It's just, I don't know what happened, but it became this thing that Douche bags would wear. I don't know. I don't know how it happened. Yeah. But it went and it came and everybody, you know what it was like, it's like the spinning wheels of clothing. Remember those spinners that people used to have on the rims? They lasted a little while where people are like, what the fuck are we doing? And it, those spinners killed the custom wheel market because you used to be, everybody would get a car and then they would get custom wheels. Like you can take a pretty decent car but put some sweet wheels on it and everybody like that's a pretty nice car.

Speaker 2:          01:26:50       But those fucking spinners came out and everybody's like, that's it. We're going the other way. Don't ever change your wheels. Just leave the fucking wheels. The car came with like, this is ridiculous. We can't be associated with this. You notice that now it's like they're, they're like painted wheels are like stand like low chain. Yeah. Low Key. You know, he might have nice wheels, but they're like painted black and match. Your car was giant gold spinning, you know? And then they had like 28 or something, they came out where it was like, I took the wheel and then they would like make the lip of the wheel even bigger. So it looked like, you know, yeah. They had tires that were like literally the thickness of an iPhone. You know, that was what it was like your tire and they put it on like a old Monte Carlo now.

Speaker 2:          01:27:33       Now it's like a Monte Carlo Monster Truck. You know, that's a common thing, right? Those impalas, they would put it on these ridiculous cars if like wagon wheels. They were like, dude, the most preposterous wheels ever. And those things break all the time. You go over a bump, hit a pothole, there's no tire. This isn't, it's like you're running around on metal rooms. They bend. Yeah, I put a 20 inch wheels on my, my accurate, and it's, they're not like flashy. They're like paint black wheels or whatever. But the either had a role, the offenders, which I didn't realize when I bought the car, but what kind of accurate you got? That's a TL. Nothing, nothing spectacular. But it's, uh, when I got the wheels, I, uh, I didn't know that you couldn't fit 20. I just want to go. They rubbed out. They would rubbed unless you rolled the, so I got, when I ordered it, they were like, well, you need to get these 30 fives are 30 tires or whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:28:24       I didn't know what it was. Apparently a 30 tire is like this big, very thin. It's incredibly thin and you know, it looks cool, but I'm constantly, every time I drive up north, I get, I get a flat tire. I like all the time I've, I've had to repair the, uh, the rims like three or four times just because the tire gets so low. Oh, he hit a bump and it puts a hole in the or bins or cracks the rim. Yeah. Go, go back to standards. They go put my stock wheels back up. Yeah. Put The stock wheels back on. Accurate. Makes a fucking hell of a car though. They're underappreciated car. Yeah, they really are. I love it. Two of those I had to Nsx is there. My, I still might go out and buy an old one. I'm still, I'm looking for one that was fucking cars are great, man.

Speaker 2:          01:29:04       I loved that car. Never had a problem. Every time you go to start rumbling starts right up on does just do, you can't fuck with Toyotas and Hondas that does. Motherfuckers will run forever. I had a Honda accord when I was in high school. It was like a 92 Honda accord and I never changed the oil and the thing. And the guy he does, I didn't know money. I drove around with $2 of the gas all the time. Like you know, you never, it never changes there. And I think I ended up having two clutches. I went through two clutches cause I was like fast and furious. The movie had come up like that and it was like burnouts at every like stop playing man. I did a lot of dumb shit with that car. You know those uh, those whippet Umm, things where you can, it's like, uh, I think it's the actual use for it is a to me like a whipped cream, yay carrier.

Speaker 2:          01:29:49       But you can, it's like a canister and you can put a little whip it cartridge in it and it'll uh, he hit the button, it'll fill up and you can fill up your balloon off of that. So I had, it was like 16 or 17. I had wired like put a tube through my, um, through my a glove box all the way into my intake in the front and I put, I was like doing a little street racer guy and I would crack off like four or five whippets in that little container and thought I had an interest in my car to my glove box. It's your story. But that Honda, I ended up giving it to a friend when I got another car and he drove it literally until the wheel fell off till the front wheel fell off and it had like over 325,000 miles on it.

Speaker 2:          01:30:30       And I think he, you know, never, you know, it just ran until the wheel fell on Japanese make amazing cars. I have a friend who was Alexis that has a million miles on it. It really a million. Yeah. It's like, it's a famous car. Like, I don't know if it's his, he drives uh, Matt Farah from the smoking tire. He always has a images of it. He's, he brings it everywhere. It just puts it online. It's got a million fucking miles on anything, a male. Again, they just don't break. This is like something happened along the way where we, it became acceptable for cars to just fuck off. That's just be a piece of shit and it's American cars. Why do we do that to ourselves? You know? So he's just a, I mean it's like, it's always the, the Japanese cars that lasts forever, don't they? The Lexus or the Toyota or the Honda.

Speaker 2:          01:31:12       Even German cars, which are amazingly, I had German car, shit, they fuck up. I know someone who has a Porsche Cayenne and uh, she, she went to start at the other day, catastrophic fucking failures. Engine light's on year old car. Probably like what a fucking hundred 60 grand or something like that. Cayenne turbo pressing buttons. All these lights are going on. Like, what's going on here? Nothing. Got a tow it and get it towed. They'd be like, oh, there's a problem wrong with your thing. And they replaced the thing and like what? Like what if you were in Alaska and then shit went wrong. Like what if you're driving across country? Yeah. You know when you're driving your portion, Alaska, you never know. I guess there are people in Alaska of portrait. This is must be, people don't want to ask you about some cheese. I want to fucking be a ball out there and drive under Mousse with a fucking Cayenne.

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       Yeah. It's something about those Japanese cars though. They for whatever reason, it's like the Japanese culture itself. You fought in Japan. I haven't, I haven't. I would think that that's like a, for a, especially for a kickboxer when it comes down to like the k one glory days, those are probably the glory days of not necessarily have more time because you know, there's a lot of like the great Moy Thai fighters particularly, uh, like in the lower weight classes came out of Thailand. Yeah. But as far as like heavyweights and the larger kickboxing bouts, like, man, it all took place in Japan. That's where, when I moved out here, when I was a 19, I was, uh, going to school and then I couldn't afford cable ahead of the job. It's like a room service attendant at the Bonaventure hotel. But I had, I would go to this, uh, video store and little Tokyo and they sold all the k one videotapes, and that was where my girlfriend coming over and just being like, can we watch something else?

Speaker 2:          01:32:57       So that was all the time was just like all the time. K One max or a k one heavyweights. And uh, yeah, I think that was the best, like the hundred foot giant screens, you know, the long walkways or as they had in k one and that was the golden era of the pageantry and it, which is what Gloria is now, you know, so I wish, yeah, I wish the, uh, the fans that love kid one would pay attention to Gloria. Well, I just think he, for this thing to fail, you know, so long that we're trying to get this sport going and, uh, you know, nobody's gonna Watch a glory show and not, not fall in love with it. You know what I mean? It's just ingrained. Turn on the damn channel. You know, I told the UFC, you know, maybe like seven or eight years ago, I told him to buy a k one cause I heard the k one was for sale.

Speaker 2:          01:33:40       I said you guys should buy k one. Does you know the ultimate fighter was originally supposed to be the cabling? Really? What do you mean? Uh, Mike Kogan, my manager told me this, he used to work with k one and k one you will say what? Scott Cougar that the uh, the ultimate fighter TV show was originally supposed to be um, k one on spike and they the deal didn't go through or something. And then Dana and the fatigue has picked it up and did the UFC one originally it was supposed to be Kaitlin. I would double check on that if it's coming from my Cogan.

Speaker 2:          01:34:13       That's what he said. You never know. He might be right. Joe Schilling is the most gullible motherfucker, but I think that the levels there, you know, like, like here, like the big fight, Rico Verhoeven, he's like, you know, like one of the best kick boxers you could put him back in the k one glory days. I mean 85 right around a lot of those big name guys. Oh yeah. I mean like think about the guys that they have. I mean there's, there's just like, there's a, there's a, there's a wealth of talent in kickboxing. Especially like a lot of these European guys, a lot of these guys from Holland, I mean there's so many good fighters. It's not a lack of talent. It's, it's one of those things where it's like, at this point it's almost like it just needs time. It's almost like it just needs, it's like if they're willing to do with the UFC did and put that and put the show on and you know, I mean, look at the, wait it out.

Speaker 2:          01:35:06       Daniel Gita. I mean, [inaudible] Saki mean there's a fucking great fighters. Can you guys have Keratan off now to some really exciting fighters in the heavyweight division as well as all the other divisions. But if they just take the, like the UFC was $44 million in the hole before the ultimate fighter, he got on the air and they were ready to pull the plug. They even, there was one point in time where Dana had, um, had a conversation with Lorenzo and they were like, look, we can't keep hemorrhaging money. Let's just sell it. Let's just get rid of this. Let's see what we can get for it. And they were going to sell it at a big loss. And, um, the next day I'll look, Lorenzo slept on it and got up and fucking changes my, I said, fuck it. Guns blazing. Let's go, let's keep going. Let's ride this bitch out.

Speaker 2:          01:35:49       Which is what you can do when you're a billionaire. Yeah. Well, I think that's, uh, that's probably not real far from where, uh, you know, the glory story is right now. Uh, Pierre, the owner of glory and the had a chairman or whatever is, uh, is definitely one funding of 90% of this stuff and, and pushing that. So, you know, thank you Pierre. Please keep it up. You know, unless they're, you know, almost, look, it's so cool. The product is there. See that's the thing. It's like the product is there, the fights are there anybody who watches that? The, the event that you were in, the last man standing right at that fucking shit is on my DVR for life. Which by the way, it cut out before the end. Somehow or another really don't know what the fuck happened. Maybe I only recorded for three hours or something like a retard, but the, of any watches that tournament, it doesn't get hooked on glory and hooked on kickboxing.

Speaker 2:          01:36:37       You got no pulse. And that's the other thing about the Gloria is doing, which I don't know, I don't know any of the finance stuff about it, but they're not going cheap on there. On any of it. You know what I mean? Like that is a huge event. The, the production is insane. The fighters are insane. I mean all of it is just really top notch. You guys got Mike Tyson pimping for it and now apparently they got Mike Tyson doing this thing, which is a, it's cool. Yeah. If you go to the glory page, go to Glory World series.com Mike Tyson is doing the intro video, which is pretty fucking bad ass and uh, is uh, Rico Verhoeven versus a Errol Zimmerman. And then there's a you versus a, this kid is only 20 years old. Huh? I think he's 22. Robert Thomas from Canada. Is He 22? Yeah, they call him the White Dragon.

Speaker 2:          01:37:24       Jim, he's good. He's a good fighter. Is going to be interesting. Yep. Um, have you seen him fight before? Yeah, I saw a couple of fights on line. He fought a arts 11 then he fought a Alex Perreira who's another guy, the top 10 in Brazil and we came up short on both of those. But you know, that was, I have a lot of respect for somebody that young in his career as, as going after the top top fights. I mean that was me. Um, the, I was the guy that, that one of those tough shots, so I know how dangerous those kind of people can be. Yeah. Last fight in glory was Gloria 18 in November. He CalEd Mike Michael Mer. So, uh, I'm just going to be fun, man. I just, I just loved the fact, like I said, that they're doing this and uh, Nicky Holsten is fighting to, who's a fuck.

Speaker 2:          01:38:08       He's so high level. He's, he's really fun to watch. He's so fun to watch. Really good technical man. Everything he does just said that classic, moist, you know, the classic kickboxing style from Holland. His boxing is like from the Nolan. He's been, he's are going back and forth doing the professional boxing over there between fights and uh, yeah, his hands are really good. He is, he's my pick for, to win the tournament. But then they also got a Raymond Daniels is human highlight real, you know, he's a really high level martial artists. I don't know if I'd really call him a kickboxer. Well, he's becoming a kickboxer really like a karate guy who's getting into MMA. It was getting, getting into kickbox you'd rather, but the shit that he does like that, that touched jumping sidekicks, spinning back kick in the air that decode his last opponent with as well.

Speaker 2:          01:38:56       But you don't do that on the bag. I got to know the height he does that and then like the timing of it. It's really, really, it's really, it's something else. Yeah. He's learning the kickboxing game. We still got like some gaps in his is striking. We see that especially the transitions between kicking and punching. Right. But the stuff that he can do, you know, and he's still fairly young. I mean, you could still learn it. He's an La guy too, isn't it? Yeah, I think so. Do you ever train with him? I supported them once, probably six years ago. I think when, um, they had that world combat league when Chuck Norris tried his little thing, it was so geared for, for his, his type of style that karate guys like none of the Moitai guys did very well in that. Um, well that world combat league did they allow leg kicks, they love leg kicks butt underneath those pants.

Speaker 2:          01:39:42       We had thick shin pads on like Oh really shin pads. And then there was only one, three minute round they made you wear Shin Pads. Yeah. Nope. There's one three minute round and it's really hard to do to really make leg kicks that affective and three minutes with giant shrimp heads on, you know what I mean? That seems ridiculous. It was, well Chuck Norris was Lee his league and it was really geared around like the point karate guys and um, and that type of style. You know what I found really interesting about it though, it was the lack of ring. I really kinda liked that. I don't don't, I'm not sure if the slower, yeah, for if you don't know what I'm talking about. They kind of, it was almost like a very shallow swimming pool or it's like it was flat in the bottom. And then for folks who didn't watch it, the, the edges were kind of sloped up but not, not a big slope, just a slight slip, just don't enough to let you know that you're at the edge and then it would bring everybody back to the center.

Speaker 2:          01:40:35       It wasn't very big thing. But I think that for, for MMA in particular, one of the things that drives people crazy is people being pressed up against the cage. And like a lot of people don't like that aspect of MMA. Like the clinching up against the cage, throwing knees to the leg and you know, they get, they start booing and they want everybody separate. I've always felt that like I have a football game can be played in a fucking China, a hundred yard field and a basketball game to be played in this, you know, really long court. Why can't an MMA fight take place on a flat, like just big round, flat area like that where you don't have a ring and there's like there's a red zone where you're out of bounds, you know, and make that red zone, you know, whatever fucking five yards or something like that and then bring everybody back to the center.

Speaker 2:          01:41:25       Well you don't have any of that. If you're going to get a take down, you've got to get an honest fucking take down. Like you're doing a wrestling match, not pushing a guy up against the cage and pulling his legs out from under him, but an actual legit takedown. Like giving them pride. It was a little harder to get a takedown. Oh yeah. Cause he couldn't put, you know, cause what they do is we'll shove it up against the fence. Then they suck your legs out. They use that a certain thing. I mean I have a lot more, I'm a lot more comfortable defending takedowns um, in the middle. You know, stuff like there's a lot easier to stop and take that once they start smashing it against the cage than there's a lot of different variables and yeah. How many fights like um, Tim, Sylvia, I think it was Tim Silvia and Brandon Vera.

Speaker 2:          01:42:03       Really? He spent like three rounds just smashed against the side of the cage the whole time. It happens, it happens a lot and people get crazy. They boo and they, you know, and it's also hard to see through a cage. Like if you, if you're standing in, in, in the crowd, even if you're in the, on the floor, if you know your couple of rows back and there's a pillar and they're behind that pillar and they're fighting, you can't see shit. You wind up looking up at the big screen. That's what I was curious. Maybe you could tell me about this. When they're the UFC judges, do they have a screen in front of what to watch now? Okay. This is something that we had a complaint about for a long time because I'm sitting there and the whole fight is going on in the upside of the cage and you can't tell what's being landed or what you know.

Speaker 2:          01:42:43       Well, there's only punches and like a lot of those punches that Anderson was thrown on. Nick, you did a really good job of blocking them, but if I'm 30 feet away, I can't tell if it landed or not. Well, it's sometimes it's really hard to tell for while we're doing commentary, like sometimes I have to watch a replay to see if something landed. Like if a guy's got his back to you and you see someone threw a punch and the guy falls down, you're like, oh, we got hit. But then you watch and you go, oh no, no, no. He stepped on his foot and he slipped and then he went down. Like sometimes it'll look like a guy got hit. Sometimes it's better to watch it at home. Really? I used to watch it live. Yeah, we watch it at home. You're going to get the perfect angle.

Speaker 2:          01:43:17       You know, the UFC broadcast team, those guys who were the production guys, they're the best. I mean there are so good at catching all the right angles. The replays are always on point. They know exactly what they're doing. Right. So you could, you could almost see it better from home then you can. But there's a lot of people that complain that like sit in the crowd, like I can't fucking see. And they wind up like you see like look out in the crowd, they're looking up at the giant screen. I've went to quite a few a UFC fights were up. It's just, I feel like you go there for the energy, you know what I mean? You're there, you're there for the energy of the crowd, but like you're watching a screen. Yeah, yeah. Well it's an event. I mean there's, there's nothing like it.

Speaker 2:          01:43:54       Like when you're watching it, like nick versus Anderson, like when they were about to fight and you know, and they're there in the center of the cage and you know the referees reading them the instructions and then they back up and you're like, Holy Shit, it's happening right there and it's fucking 30 feet away is about to go down. There's nothing like that. That's some goosebump inducing shit. And then he lays it down and you're like, Holy Shit. When he laid down and put his hands on his head, like he's taking a nap as wedge and like, Yeah Dude, I was careening, laughing, CTV. I was pounded on the table and crying, laughing. I couldn't help myself. I just was so funny. It's so good. Why W I had wondered too, whether or not nick was going to clown them because all the stuff leading up to the fight was totally respectful. All the stuff leading up to fight was like, hey, you know, nick was saying, I want big names, I want a big name fight. This is a big name fight. So you know, I respect him and we're ready to go. And then when it got to the octagon, immediately he's talking shit. And you could see Anderson was just so not comfortable being the guy that gets shit talked to. And I was telling him keep talking. Like I'll say like I said fucking with and be like, keep fucking with him. It's weird because

Speaker 3:          01:45:05       when nick stopped fucking with him in the later rounds, Anderson started doing a lot better. You know, I think no doubt has definitely um, you know, the mind game and uh, I think it was a really good strategy that he didn't come up

Speaker 2:          01:45:18       and I, he kind of, he said in the back that it was going to do something like that. I, I had no idea he was going to lay down and put his hands like that. Well, he probably didn't even know before he did that. I think he just, he just knew like if he's gonna, if he doesn't want to engage with, you know, I think he said I'm going to flip that switch.

Speaker 3:          01:45:36       I didn't realize that was the switch he was talking about what God was awesome and really like, it's hard. Like, you know, that there's, uh, an article just came out and said it was called the sober replay or like the sober thought, like when you watch a fight after like the next day or whatever. And when we were in the the corner, you know, we're yelling instructions, but between Gilbert and Nate Diaz and Cesar Gracie and that all of us were just sitting there like, this guy is such a fucking beast. Like we are so blown away by what he was doing. We were just so impressed and I was really proud of him.

Speaker 2:          01:46:10       Well, especially first time finding it one 85 too. He steps up and fights the greatest ever at one 85 after two year layoff, two year layoff words, not, you know, just really not pursuing any fights at all. Just, you know, made a shitload of money off the George Saint Pierre fight and just laid back and relaxed for a little bit and just said he wanted a big fight. You know. I mean he had said before, he goes, I want a title shot. And they're like, well, we can't really just give you a title shot. Like you got to beat somebody, you know, and this was an opportunity to fight, you know, a guy who it'd be, it's just like getting a title shot. I mean five round fight with Anderson and then to do so well, I mean the, the judges' scorecards and they gave it all five rounds to Anderson, but every one of those rounds were very competitive except the fourth.

Speaker 2:          01:46:54       I think nick took off the fourth round, but every one of those rounds I thought it was really competitive and really close. He was competitive enough. And especially if you consider the other fights in Anderson has been right. I think that's probably also, you know, they say like you have to beat the champion so to speak. I felt like you have to really beat this underdog and it didn't feel like Anderson did it that much. You know what I mean? You really didn't whoop Nick's ass. He'd won. I felt like he wanted, I feel like he played it safe as fuck. Right. I mean he threw some wild shit. He threw a wheel kick at one point in time, but there was no, no moment in time where he was treating nick the way nick treated him, you know where he was like, come on bitch, like let's do this, let's do this.

Speaker 2:          01:47:32       You know, like stood in front of him. He just wasn't ready for that. I mean the psychological aspect also having a guy like nick taunt you. If nick knocked him out, like what if he was taunting him and then all of a sudden boom, nick catches him, he's down. Like that would just be devastating and he just was not prepared for that. Or Nick lays on the ground and he jumps into the next garden. Niggas trying to name triangles. Yeah. Anything can fucking happen in MMA and a guy like Anderson knows it as much as anybody now, especially after it happened to him. Right. I think also too, the pressure of competing at that high level and being the champ for as long as Anderson was like, I remember when Bj Penn beat Matt Hughes and I talked to Matt, he was after it was over and he was really honest about it in the cage.

Speaker 2:          01:48:13       He said, honestly, is a relief. Like being a champion is a lot of fucking stress. You know, he didn't swear, but he was like, it's, it's, it's a relief. You know, I'm glad I got this weight lifted off my back and I'm gonna go back and relax and see what's up. And that's kind of the impression I got from Georgia. And I was talking to George. He's the same way though. It's extremely, there's a ton of pressure to be a champion for that long. And then everybody, you know, everybody wants you, everybody calls you out, everybody wants to fight you. Everybody attacks your character. That's got to get pretty old. And Nick was talking about that the other day and his post fight interview, he's like, you know, I wish I would fall. I kind of wish I fell off and people stopped talking about me. Well, he's such an enigma, you know, there's no one liked Nick Diaz, such an unusual character.

Speaker 2:          01:48:58       He really is. I mean, I'm good friends with them and I really have no fucking idea what's going on in his head 90% of the time, which actually makes it really fun sometimes. You know. How often do you train with him? Uh, I was training with them a lot for the mill and fight until my dad died. I left, uh, his, his pad to go to the funeral and stuff. Um, but yeah, I'm go up there pretty, pretty regularly. And when nick is in between camps is, I mean like does he, is he training on a regular basis? Does he still do everything or is he just a relaxing, like what does, what does he been doing and like over the two years? Yeah, when I was, had the, uh, last man standing tournament, that was back in northern June, June or July, he hadn't, I don't think he had booked through the intercept fight yet. He still was running with me and I mean I'm training for the hardest part of my life were running six and a half miles and he's pushing me like I'm trying to keep up with him.

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       Wow. He runs at a ridiculous pace. He's just your runs or an insane pace. Does that fuck with your explosion at all? Like there's some people that believe that all that slow running and slow twitch endurance type work that again actually fuck with your explosion. A Knicks guys disagree with me, but I think it does. I think that him, uh, nick and Nate both are, uh, not the most like a explosive people when it comes to like their movement patterns or whatever. I feel like with me doing more, I do a lot more sprint work than I do long distance kind of stuff. Um, but also like that's more of their, of their style. They're, they're very technical with their stuff. They don't use a lot of strength and they, uh, both of them will wear you out and then whoop your ass after it.

Speaker 3:          01:50:33       Right. Both of them have beat the piss out of me from just being durable as shit. And I'm throwing and throwing and throwing and throwing and throwing and I'm like, Oh fuck, I'm tired. And then there's a bump motherfucker. Yet they still talking shit. Once you're tired they start talking to Ya. Well, just the whole time, you know, the whole time he, you're sparring let me talk shit. Like what's he saying? Uh, you know, uh, I don't know. Come on, Shit like that. Nay. When, um, let's see, when the, uh, for this last fight we were sparring and nicotine, I think it was when the UFC was filming it. Um, nick had done like nine, five minute rounds with fresh guys. I was like me cheaty and Connie had brought in to spar with him and then, um, another guy and like the last round I could tell he was tired and it was kind of like clenching me up against the fence and was like holding or whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:51:15       And I'm like, come on Nicole school, like kind of like motivated and he's like, fuck you motherfucker. And like started whoop my ass. Like you know, the thing about without cause has mentioned is like sometimes it's a lot better, which I agree with. It's a lot better. Sometimes disbar people you don't know instead of like your buddy, you know you get, you go a little harder or you're a little more competitive with somebody you don't know. And like when nick and I first started, I mean he used to be a lot more competitive with me and then now we're, we're pretty good friends so I have to, I find myself like talking shit to him or trying to piss him off or hit him hard to get him to, to push a little harder. That's interesting. So replicates and actual competition more in that way then it does like light sparring with your friends.

Speaker 3:          01:51:57       Right? I mean I think there's different, there's different times, different stuff, you know, like something, I'm at the point now where I don't feel like I don't have to win in sparring. I, you know, I can work on other things. I can work on my defense, I'll work on stuff. Whereas I used to be like I have to win in sparring. If I lost around in sparring, I was really upset about it. Um, but like nick, uh, I always say this like with nick, uh, yes ma'am. She, he'll, uh, he'll coast or he'll, uh, with this camp he was coasting and some of the rounds, or if I put him in there with somebody that wasn't that hard, he would like not do so well. And then we just kind of go at the level of the person he was going with. So I found that, that, uh, you know, I would tell the people to hit him a lot, fucking harder, almost try to piss him off, talk shit to him.

Speaker 3:          01:52:42       I tried, I tried my best, like Anderson Silva come on, come on, like a impressions with, uh, when we were sparring, his kicking was a lot better in this fight. And we never seen it before. Was, is that all, you know, there's a lot of people, interviews people, some guy, some interview guy, I forget which, who was, but he was like, you know, how do you feel about this fight with nick? You know, looking at Nathan, Nate, Nate's last performance, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah. Was trying to compare like Nate versus [inaudible] major inducer good against [inaudible] then you know, and I'm like how the Fed Samara, my math two fucking completely different people. Two different opponents, two different people, two different weight classes. But uh, yeah, a lot of times when people have complained to the, both of them don't, don't block kicks very well. And their understanding of of kickboxing is a little different.

Speaker 3:          01:53:27       So like for me as a, as like a coach, so to speak, in this camp, I was trying to put and bring in the best possible sparring partners I could for them. So I brought it art some love and I brought in Shitty and Connie was sparring with me. I believe in a lot. I got a lot of flack for this. I believe all three of those people are better kickboxers that Anderson Silva being that they're kickboxers and Anderson Silva as Ann Mei fighters. It's not a knock on Anderson Silva. I just think that those are very high level. Um, well, it's just a reality. It's reality. You know what I'm saying? I mean, Anderson has had spectacular striking moments in MMA, right when it comes to his actual real world kickboxing experience. It's, it's fairly limited. There's not nearly as many fights, especially in like worldclass competition. But it was like, you know, uh, our team has a very like, confident, like a head movement.

Speaker 3:          01:54:20       He's like a cold, very elusive, very sneaky, similar traits that Anderson has, but at a higher level, um, I think I hit a lot harder than, than Anderson and am a little more aggressive and you know, whatever things that I do well translated well and, and nick for as far as the looks and the feelings. And then what Judy and [inaudible], he's got phenomenal movement. He looks similar to, um, Anderson. He, uh, he's got like four inch longer reach than, or somebody has a very, very similar movement patterns and the things that he does. So my thing was, you know, and nick didn't necessarily beat any of us in any of that, you know what I mean? But he got used to seeing those situations so that when it happened, when Anderson through that spinning heel kick, nick was prepared for it, moved out of the way.

Speaker 3:          01:55:04       Um, most of the kicks he blocked, you know, nick through a lot more kicks then and he usually does his way more. His awareness of kickboxing, it showed, you know, and that was, you know, I didn't know how to fight was going to go, but I knew that I felt a lot of responsibility as far as if nick got caught with something, some kick or some, some kickboxing move. I felt like I was going to be my fault. But I didn't show him holding pads with him. Totally fads for him. Just so you were working on this combinations like that left leg kick was big. That was more, he landed more leg kicks on Anderson than anybody had ever done before. If you go back and watch Anderson's fights, nobody, nobody landed like that. That left leg kick over and over again. He landed that, I don't think Anderson expected that.

Speaker 3:          01:55:43       Right. You know, Anderson stands southpaw, so that right leg is exposed. And, and nick landed that left leg kick over and over again. Yeah. Uh, there was something that we had worked on was just him, him throwing kicks and being more comfortable with kicks. I've always tried to get him to kick more, but it was something where, um, he's a lot more confident with his hands. He's had more experience with his hands. And then sometimes if you don't kick enough, someone's making you forcing you kick all the time and the gym, you get tired when you throw a kick. You know, if I'm used to boxing all the time and the throw one or two kicks, I've, it's like going for a take down on their tires. So I wanted to make sure that he felt, felt good. You know, we worked on some elbows from the clinch.

Speaker 3:          01:56:20       I thought he did really well. I'm against Anderson in the clinch, especially if you look at like how rich Franklin did. So, you know, my goal wasn't to make nick a high level kickbox. It was just to make him his awareness of kickboxing and his defense, you know? And I think, I think it showed the, he showed a lot, you know, I didn't know it. It definitely did. Now does nick do any weight lifting? Does he do any strength and conditioning stuff for this fight? He did. Um, but again, it's not, was it wasn't that heavy, but he, he worked his way up and he did, he did start weightlifting for that and I think he put on, you know, he still was like right around 201 it was walking around for the fight, you know, he was, he was by no means like two oh five or to 10.

Speaker 3:          01:57:01       That's still heavy for him. Made a hit tool five. That's for him. That's pretty heavy though, isn't it? But yeah, it is. And I thought that like when the, when fight week came and he cut the weight, he had a pretty easy weight cut. I think he dropped like 10 pounds of water, uh, want to say he got in the ring probably around one 95. But like you could see he was definitely bigger than he was, but it was like solid weight. It wasn't like somebody blew up and you know, j pen fought Machita or something like that, which all sloppy. Right. So is Nick gonna Compete again or would it, what does this thoughts after this fight? Uh, probably said it four times on this show, Jill. I'll say it again. I really have no fucking idea what's going on in his head. Uh, I hope he does.

Speaker 3:          01:57:39       I think we, uh, you know, there was some stuff that, uh, one of the problems that we had in the fight was it was the first time I'd ever cornered nick. And when I was yelling stuff at him, he didn't recognize my voice. So a lot of the stuff I was saying, they told me after, he was like, oh, that was you. And I was like, what was it screaming fucking Portuguese? And was like, fuck, I didn't know if that was, you know, and um, that's funny. Yeah. I think we could do even better. And I think, um, I think you did great. I think he has some really exciting matchups for him. Um, I'd like to see him rematch, Carlos condit. I think that'd be a huge fight will be great fun to watch. I'd like to see him rematch. Uh, you know, Robbie Lawler would be huge, you know, maybe to Carlos and then that gives them a title shot and maybe didn't give him title shot. I don't really know. I'm just guessing. I love those two fights. I think jazzy, fantastic. After a two year layoff or whatever it is, if he does decide to come back, I think that's another awesome fight. You know, Nick says he wants the big fights. He's obviously a marquee fighter. I think that there's a lot of uh, really exciting. Matchups well, I think this fight only raised his profile so too, I think he did a fantastic job against the greatest

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       of all time. It means him and fade or those are the two arguments or who's the greatest of all time? It's Anderson and Fado and uh, you know, it's one of those, no, there's no right answer, you know, fade or had some amazing fights in pride. And then, but the problem is those guys that he fought, they came over from pride and they fought in the UFC. They didn't look nearly as good. So what does that, is that because fade or beat them up is because they're not on steroids anymore? Is it because they weren't that good in the first place? Is it their shopworn? Is it the cage? Right. There's all these different questions, but those are the two guys that, in my opinion, I go with Anderson because it mostly because I've seen him live and I think that the level of competition that he faced is probably a little higher, but it's, it's an argument that I could see, like, see when people say a fader was the greatest of all time, I'm like, yeah, I could see your argument. You know? I mean I'm not, I'm not 100% against it, but to go five rounds like nick did, being a guy who fought his original career at one 55. Unbelievable, amazing. I mean you fuck fucking Diego Sanchez at one 55 and he fought a lot. Sean sherk one 55 and fights Anderson 30 pounds heavier and it's very competitive.

Speaker 3:          01:59:48       They're seventh fight where somebody, he is his opponent was either at one time a UFC champion or went on to become a UFC champion. He fought six or seven of those guys in his career. That's amazing. That's amazing. Right. Was the thing up to your face soap? So I hear you better. Sorry. And then when, uh, when I was going through his, uh, I was looking at the opponents and the strikers that, uh, Anderson had fought in his career. Then I was looking at the strikers and the opponents that naked fought and his career. And it was just for my own curiosity, but like nick fought straight straight would his words hitters and at their best, you know, Paul Daley, Paul Daley, when, uh, Robbie Lawler was a monster, you know, at his best when I'm, or now he's got a new best, I'm not sure, but I think he's at his best. But then Chris Lytle, you know, uh, a lot of like really, really good strikers when they were, you know, uh, the Japanese guy, uh, when he fought him in pride, gummy gummy. Yeah. Jeez, go me was knocking the shit out everybody. And so nick has always taken those really tough fights and whether people love him or hate him, no one can ever say that. Nick doesn't fought his way to get where he is, you know?

Speaker 4:          02:00:55       No doubt. It's really impressive. No, he's a very good, very good fighter. It's just one of those things where I just, I just feel like the right now is a great time for him. If he wants to like follow through right now, if you really want to remain active and jump right back in there, there's so many marquee battles for him. I would love to see nick versus Hector Lombard. You want to talk about PR? I mean what the fuck would happen with the tax or Lumbar of nick starts talking shit to him like that, you know, and it's good fight too. Great Fight Hector's a monster

Speaker 3:          02:01:23       and Matt Brown would be an awesome, there's a lot of really exciting fights from at one 70 and I'm sure there are some in one 85 as well. Yeah. And if he's wants to do some good fights and you know now that watching them against Anderson Silva, there's not really a way class. I want to see him fight that.

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       You know what I mean? Which was heavy, heavy weight, but no higher than one of the five. But all those guys. Yeah, I think he could go back and forth between 70 and one five he wanted to, and it's funny that you know, people are watching that fight and they're like, oh, Anderson's, you know, that would, let's see, Anderson retire, he's not the same person anymore. Nobody's saying that about Nikka and that's after a two year layoff. It's true. She's really impressive. Well, people are concerned about Anderson first of all that, you know, after the fight was over to watch him like weeping. Like that is also one of the reasons why people concern. Right. You know, they're like Jesus Christ. Like this is like the, the pressure on this guy must have been tremendous. Right? 39 years old. I've come back from, uh, from teen, from knee surgeries before and like, that must have been such a relief, a really challenging thing to come back from all that.

Speaker 2:          02:02:26       And you know, you know, maybe he wasn't crying because he was, he said it was theirs. I don't know why he was crying, but I'm sure that was a lot emotional to go through, you know, and to come back after being knocked out and you know, basically humiliated and then we're going to next fight again. Your leg shattered and you're out for another year, you know? Yeah. It's a lot, a lot of pressure on, on somebody and maybe those are just tears of joy. He was happy to, or pride or whatever it was, you know? Right. Well, the second fight that what disturbed me wasn't even the leg snap. I mean the leg snap was disturbing, but I'd seen that before. What disturbed me was how easy it went down in the clinch. He got clenched up and Weidman hit him on the right hand and it's like his body just gave out.

Speaker 2:          02:03:04       And I was like, I don't like that. Because if you go back and you watch Anderson's younger days, he took a fucking tremendous punch. You go back, watch him versus uh, uh, what's it Jorge Alovera. Yeah. And he gets cracked with Jorge Rivera. It was Jorge Rivera, not Oliver. Uh, George Rivera. Yeah, Jorge. Right. He caught whatever he calls it. It was a big puncher. He's a big puncher. And Anderson like stood in front of him and let him tee off on him. It was weird. And then he was like smiling at him and then, and then fucked him up afterwards. And I'll tell the Lee Marie fight, he got tagged by Lee Marie and when he marries a fucking murderous puncher, fine, no, you know, no problems at all. It's just one of those things where when it goes, it goes, yeah, that's true. And that was something else that we were looking at like in the and the uh, and the camp, you know, are looking at, you know, we're obviously concerned that of a hell nick was getting reacting to clench with, um, with innocent after seeing Anderson's fight with rich Franklin, you know, and then watching the fight over again with Weidman and I was like, I want you to punch from there.

Speaker 2:          02:04:12       Just start throwing punches and cross space to get out of that. Clinton, you see how, how easily nick was able to get out of it and how well it worked for Weidman. It was like with Rick, with a rich Franklin, he had really no idea what to do there, you know? So yeah. It's interesting. Yeah. Rich was at a loss when it came to that. He, he know he's a very tough guy and a very well, well conditioned guy, but I don't think it was the most technical when it came to certain aspects of fighting. But he was at a different, he came up in a different era, you know? And that was, that was my goal when it came to like bringing in the sparring partners and putting them in those situations. Rich Franklin obviously is capable of doing a lot of different things in that clinch.

Speaker 2:          02:04:50       He just had never been in that situation. His training partners didn't expect it or, or what hadn't been prepared him for that. So once Anderson hits you with a few of those knees, you're kind of fucked. Oh yeah. Yeah. And then, uh, you know what you're going to do makes it, if no one's ever taught you anything other, it was like, oh shit, I'll need me. They're getting them back. It's place. So, yeah, he didn't know how to control the hips. He didn't know what to do and it just, you know, that was, that was, he was new school. He was like the new era in like 2003. That's what Franklin was. He was like the new era of athletes supreme. We conditioned, I remember they used to show on those countdown shows, these show his training. Right. You know, his workout routine. It was brutal.

Speaker 2:          02:05:29       I mean nobody worked out back then as hard as rich Franklin. He was huge for one 85. What was that Hawaiian League he used to fight in before UFC was like a super bro. He was like two 25 champion. He's a heavyweight. He was a big guy, big guy. It's really fic. And uh, when he went down to one 85, you mean he was a, it was a struggle there. The first few fights at one 85 before he figured out how to dial it in perfectly. It was a struggle. It's a, that's the weird thing about what we were talking about before, the weight cutting. Like what, what's too much? What's not enough? Yeah. You know, and then he, you know, he was the guy to retire chocolate Dell at two oh five so it's, you know, nobody saw that coming. Right. You ever thought that rich Franklin was gonna knock chocolate, Dell dead?

Speaker 2:          02:06:12       You know who, who thought that was going to happen? What a weird fluke shot. Not a fluke. I mean obviously probably meant to do it, but the way that chuck went down, it wasn't like you seen chuck get hit with way harder shots for that. Yeah. That was just a sign. You know, like once you, once it's gone, it's gone. He got tagged earlier in the round two that I think contributed to that and he got, he got hit with some big shots earlier in the round where you could see like he got dinged. You know, Dana and I actually talked about it before and he said he felt like chuck was hurt early in the round and you know, that was just the one that just put them away was the one that that landed. It was crazy that rich was, he hit him with a broken arm, you know, he hit him with a right hand and then after the right hand he hit him with his left and his left had been snapped earlier in the fight.

Speaker 2:          02:06:57       He didn't even, you know, just threw punches, didn't even realize it. And after the fight he realizes, Oh shit fucks going on with this thing. That's a common thing. And kickboxing though isn't it like blocking those kicks on the forum taken kicks on. The arm is uh, there's a, there's a way he can do it though, like a lot of people. Um, and that was, I think it was explained to nick and this campus. Somebody along the line told Nick to block like you're holding pads this way. So that's like exposes your skin. This is like exposes your, your for like the bone on bone. If you keep this inside, you're going to take it on like the meat of the arm, the meat of your, your other arm. And then you put one hand here. So this doesn't hurt nearly as bad as going here.

Speaker 2:          02:07:40       It's bone on bone. And the Shin is going to win against the owner, whatever button every time. It's so weird when you watch a guys shit get broken like the Tyrone Spong [inaudible] Saki fight. Especially when a guy likes bong. It's just such a, such a high level. Kickboxer you watched him throw a kick and then you see his leg just go noodle, just snap. And then, uh, I think, uh, Jerome, the banner had broke [inaudible] arm back in k one once in the past two, so, well remember when [inaudible] fought against Alistair Overeem and the finals? His arm was shot. Yeah. That's what it was. He got hit and his arm was fucked up before, you know, that fight even started. He threw like one more kick everything off. Yeah. He was done at arms done. Yeah. The bones to just nothing, nothing that makes them any tougher than that.

Speaker 2:          02:08:30       You know, you're born with a certain amount of bone density and you could lift weights and they'll get thicker and a little bit stronger. But, so someone was telling me that they, cause usually, uh, all of the guys that I can remember that I've seen with it breaking their legs were always black guys. You know, this, this wow, somebody was telling me that I think you can Google it, that there is a, uh, there was actually studied them by it, that um, if vitamin D I think it's d three, like something that we get from the sun, um, the darker skin people have like a, almost like a filter of it and they don't, um, they don't, uh, don't absorb as much, absorb as much as it and, but it was like Corey Hill tireless and long and he said Sova Danny Beal back in the day, like almost every person I can think of the head, their lakes snapped and kickboxing was this black guy.

Speaker 2:          02:09:16       I've definitely seen white guys online get their leg snapped and kickboxing. I'm sure white white dudes are just as vulnerable. Had the guy, I thought somebody told me that and I googled it and then sure enough there was like a study done on it that it works like a, you're darker skin tone works as like a filter and you don't absorb as much. I think it was d three that's weird because I guess you know the more melanin acts as like sunscreen. It was melanin. Something like that's interesting. I don't know about all that and I couldn't believe it. Joe Rogan's like Joe Schilling gold throws out facts and that's what everybody does in ratio though. I do it all the time, but I think that like, but I did Google that one I want. It's true, but African Americans tend to have thicker bone density. See, I think it was the exact opposite is what that says. That's not true. They definitely have more bone density because in fact African American women tend to have the same, a similar bone density as European males. Brilliant. Yeah. Yeah. Africans have a thicker bone density Africans in general, but you got to realize that that varies with strength training. Like when, when they do that with people, a lot of times they're, you're not testing people that are lifting weights. When you lift weights, your bone density increases dramatically, especially with people who do like power lifting and you're like, their fucking

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       jaws get wider. You know, their head gets thicker and it's because your body, your whole body is dealing with, there's a little bit of that going on too. But even if your natural just carrying that, you know, just lifting very heavy things forces your body to go, oh, this motherfucker, what are we doing with our body here? You know, your body's pretty adaptable man. I mean, you look at people that are Yogis, it can get in all these crazy positions and they're not born that way. They're just slowly stretching themselves into that position, you know? And that's, that's the flexibility of your muscles. It's the density of your bones that the body will adapt to stress. The more you give it, the more it sort of tried to conform to this new work that you're asking it to do by then like kicking pads and like, oh yeah sure our phones get thicker.

Speaker 4:          02:11:24       Oh yeah, like the micro, micro whatever. Well they also say, um, when you're kicking like Shin on Shin all the time, what you're also doing is you get these, the posits of blood and it fills up and calcifies and you know all the bruises. When it heals those microfractures and tiny, you're getting all this calcification, it almost leads to like a Shin instep protector, you know, all over your Shin. Like do you ever see that fight in lion fight or mallow pet just starts, uh, he, he kicks his guy and you see the guy react and so he just starts going Shin to sham with them just winging his shins. And I'm laughing at the guy cause Malpass shins. It's been known since he was like six and he's got over like 400 fights I think. Yeah. Ridiculous nuts. But it's almost like he's got armor on his shins.

Speaker 4:          02:12:12       He just smashing them into the other guy shins and laughing at him while he's doing that because his shins all just fucking covered this, this, this layer of protection that's been built up like knuckles, like those dudes, those co Karate Maki Wara guys I had to go constantly. There's lots of, does that fuck your hands up though? Cause I would think that like, I would think so. I mean I used to tell him all the time like bro you were, we work gloves, wrap your hands. The fuck is the point of that shit. Like kick that thing cause you've got to do it. Like what the fuck are you doing? You know? But he was like on some like Samurai type shit. Well his knuckles were just be like just crazy calcified me my up pretty big knuckles now too. But I don't, I don't, I would think that like your hand would not work properly.

Speaker 4:          02:12:56       Got Arthritis and shit. That's what I'm looking to be worried about. The arthritis. My friend John, he used to do that shit. He used to break bricks and those karate demonstrations and Shit, but he would always practice like hitting the Maki Warrah and his, uh, which is a mock, your war is just like this for folks who don't understand. It's like a two by four that's wrapped with rope and they, they, you know, lock it into the ground so it's real stiff and they would pound this two by four with a rope until you develop all this calcification and all this, um, this, uh, calluses all over the top of your knuckle where it's like one big knuckle. The first knuckles become

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       one big giant knuckle. But does that help your hands? I protect you from getting injured. I don't, I don't know. It seems like it would, I think most of the time that Andrea is a happen in boxing or fighting is usually these bones, the small ones towards the pinky and the next finger, right? Yeah. They're not protected as much. Well, like this is actually, if you break this and you go to the doctor, they're going to call it a boxer's fractures.

Speaker 5:          02:13:57       I broke mine when I was kid. But these are usually the bones of break,

Speaker 2:          02:14:00       but usually they say like you want to hit with these two bones that cause these two buttons line up directly with your wrist. These two are like kind of on an angle. So it's a lot easier to break these. Yeah. Yeah. Especially considering like how your hands built. Like some people they have a more narrow hand. Maybe it would be more protected by the outside edge, but mine's sticks out on the side. Yeah. It's like a weird thing man. The hands just not designed to punch people.

Speaker 5:          02:14:25       Speaking of which like Nick's is not really, nick has like this crazy not right here on his, I just saw it the other day and it was on both of those and like what the fuck is it

Speaker 2:          02:14:33       probably broken and never did anything about it. That is nut probably broke it. Just let it get me a lot. It sounds like this crazy lifted up thing like right here in the center of his hands on his hands. That's probably not good. That guy's got some scar tissue. He's got some cars that she's been through some fucking wars. But look at you man, looking beautiful. 31 years of age. Look, I me, if people didn't know you, they would never think you're a professional. Kickboxer

Speaker 5:          02:14:59       that's true. I've had a few cuts and scratches. I've got uh, both of my own, both sides of my eyes that have cut under both eyes, never broke my nose. All those Simon Marcus and I think our first flight he had slammed me, like trip me and like landed on top of me and knocked me. I was out of it and stand up and I'm walking the wrong direction and the ref was a plantation and said fight and I just got blasted like two more times. But after that fight, like one of, one of the things he finished him, it was like a push kick to the face. And after that fight, like all of the cartilage inside my nose, like this ball or whatever is not, doesn't sit right anymore. It's like a little crooked because of this. I can't fix it.

Speaker 2:          02:15:35       Does it breathe? Can you breathe in? You know,

Speaker 5:          02:15:37       I read that the both though. That's good, but it's like if I stick my finger in this part of this space and like this one, there's like a ball in there where he just kind of rearranged my cartilage, gave me a nose job and knocked him out. Or even,

Speaker 2:          02:15:51       well, the last fight is the fight. That's the most important. Right, right. You know, if you had knocked him out the first time, then he'd beat me a few times. He wouldn't feel so even, yeah, we were talking about taking punches. I need to put him on blast or no, he uh, after I was the first person to knock about and he was 39 and o or it's super impressive record, you know, it was awesome. Um, but he just fought in China I think a week or two ago and he got dropped like three or four times and finish like he can take a punch anymore. Like we haven't really affected it as a fan, as some Chinese guy. I don't remember. Just say, Oh shit. If say look up Simon Marcus,

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       that's, that's important. That's really incredible. When you think about the fact that he did have that amazing record coming into that fight with you, that fucking righthand that you landed on him was so perfect. It was so perfect to watch him fucking just drop like you guys shot by a sniper, you know, to the front of all the people in la. You know it's gotta. I to tell you that before that that can't stop. Crazy is fun until you have someone fucking yelling it over and over behind you here. Why are you trying to watch the fights? I was watching the fights and some chick was yelling crazy. Like fucking relax honey. Okay. We heard it the first 30 times she did allude to the cap cap yelling at while you were fighting. Really can't stop crazy. I Dunno. Just trying to get on camera.

Speaker 4:          02:17:14       I don't know what it was. That's awesome. There's quite obnoxious, I mean it was obnoxious but awesome that you have that kind of supports. Awesome. Out of that kind of support put dude when he went down that place with deafening cause he's in your hometown in La. That was wild shit. It was such an incredible, I mean I, I'm used to get him before glory came along. I was fighting it man. I had some pretty bit lion fight. That's a big shows when um, uh, the hard rock, but for the most part it was like Hollywood Park Casino, you know, 1200 people to be at the forum and like walking out. Usually I walk out and I'm like tunnel vision. I don't see the fans. I'm just focusing on one of them too. I like when I walked out for that, like the ovation from all of the fans was like, it was, it kind of chokes me up a little bit.

Speaker 4:          02:17:52       I had to like take a breath and like blow kisses to the fans. I had to do something just to show my appreciation. It was, it was really overwhelming. It was an awesome environment. Managed. The forum was so packed and it was so intense and it was, everybody was also recognizing that this was a big moment for kickboxing, kickboxing. You know, I've been to a bunch of smokers and I've been to some, some probe matches in La and around the area was always, they were small. It wasn't that, you know, well received. It wasn't that big of a deal. But man this was a giant deal. All of this spike TV cameras, you know, everybody, people being interviewed and the whole deal it was like it was, there was so much energy behind it that like everybody was realizing wow this might and the fact that there's a big pay per view card, like this might be a big moment where kickboxing becomes just like MMA, you know, becomes like this next level sport.

Speaker 4:          02:18:42       Cause I'd always had like when you look at the level of competition, like when MMA became huge, the level of competition was not nearly as high as where the level of kickboxing competition is right now. The level is very high. Like the Nikki Holt Skins and the, you know, the, the, the, the guys that are at the very top of the list. There's this, this level that's like a real solid world championship world class level. We're, the MMA wasn't really there in 2005 when it went in merged. It's like, it's like all the pieces are in place. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well that's like tough guys. They weren't the skillset. Yeah. But we'll, we'll go back to rich Franklin. I mean rich friend goes a very good fighter but like the difference between like rich of,

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       you know the, the rich Franklin, the fought Anderson Silva and say like, um, you know like one of the like mighty mouse Johnson who was in my opinion, the most technically sound fighter like that mother fucker is worldclass at everything he does. Everything he does is perfect. You've got that, you know, like we'd mark to bond to you got that with you. You got that with the elite kickboxers of today. Whereas I don't think MMA had that when it started to take off. So like if like, if the promotion was behind it and if they just, if, if it caught on with the American people and the names started getting established, you know, Joe Schilling and all these guys and you know, these, these, these names became more established and it became something that became, you know, mainstream. I just think like the, the quality's there, the product is there, it's all just a matter of promoting it and getting people to, that's the other thing that Dana said when I was trying to get them to buy it.

Speaker 2:          02:20:21       Like way back in the day, they're like, you know what? Americans were so poisoned by like PKA karate, you know, that they just have this idea in their head is like, it's just dog shit. Right. You know, like the, like when guys would throw like a bunch of flippy kicks just to get the kicks in and you know, you have to throw like five, six around or whatever after that. Yeah. It was like, it was a weird time. It just wasn't the same. It's like the, the level just wasn't the same. It's not like what you see today. You know, like what, what you see today when you see they're throwing kicks cause the kicks are effective. Like, like Raymond Daniels. I mean that guy is throwing some wild, crazy shit. You know Daniel Gita, he's throwing some fucking powerful fucking kicks. That's what's really exciting about the kickbox if we were talking to the day, but there's, there's the heavyweight division and MMA right now is uh, it's lacking compared to the other divisions, right?

Speaker 2:          02:21:15       When you look at kickboxing heavyweights, you got guys like digital Kita who's like six [inaudible] five, like 245 pounds through an heg kicks him punch speed of like a middle weight. You know, Rico Verhoeven like the heavyweights and kickboxing. You got guys that are like six, five and they're still throwing head kicks. They don't move like Tim Silvia, they don't like these MMA guys are used to seeing. And it's just really, really exciting stuff. Like Rico Verhoeven is incredibly athletic. He, uh, he's a sparring partner with uh, with, uh, shit, I forget his name. Um, really high level boxers and a Europe. And then a aerial Zimmerman is just a knockout artist from, from the k one days. He fought all the top guys in k one it's just really, really exciting stuff. And Rico Verhoeven is conditioning. Yeah. I mean for heavyweight, he's a lot like Cain and that sense to where that guy just does not get tired. I mean, he will go five, 5 million or five, three minute rounds and be 100% through the, and that's where he beat Daniel Gita. I think he started wearing them down and then the conditioning sorta took in me. He can fight at a very high level for a long time. And he's a young guy too. He's got a, he's got a bright future. I don't know. I think he's 20 I'm sorry, 26

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       at most. Yeah. Yeah. It's um, what's it say here? And he's a huge guy. You know, when, when you're next to him, like he's huge hands. Like he's just a big giant, giant man.

Speaker 4:          02:22:36       Yeah. I just hope it takes off, man. I really do because I think I like, I do enjoy boxing. I'm a big boxing fan, but I like kickboxing a lot more. Like I will watch kickboxing fights over and over again. I will rewatch them. Where I think the more elements you add two to fighting, the more interesting it becomes I law. I actually kind of wish it was more tie, you know? I think that the clinching is an important aspect of it. The tying up the knees to the body and in the dumps. I think those that's, that's an important part of the art that I and also the elbows and knees in the clinch. I mean I think they're very important. That's why I love malign fight. Well and Kevin Ross is your guy, right? Train with him on my best friends. Yeah. I love that guy.

Speaker 4:          02:23:18       I love watching him fight too. He's a pure Moitai like you watch him fight every, I mean the way he controls distance, the distance between the throwing the kicks and the punches in that like he's doing everything the right way. Where like the right technique for the right distance. It's all like, it's a beautiful thing to watch. You get to see the true art of Moitai represented when he's fighting. You know? Absolutely. Absolutely. They think that's, I think that's missing in, in a little bit in Gloria. I'm like, I think I wish they would go with the elbows and the knees and letting guys tie up in the clinch and throw knees to the body.

Speaker 3:          02:23:51       I think their, their thought process with the clinches that it turns to some guys, it turns into like a way of stalling or with like, you can't punch with them. You can't, you're not as good at punching and kicking. So you just clinch him up and then, you know, it ends up being like a wrestling match. What they're saying. I think they're silly. I think my two fights with seven Marcus. Absolutely.

Speaker 4:          02:24:09       Well Simon Mark is, that is his style, right? That was, that was one of the reasons why he beat so many guys. He's clinch was phenomenal and he was so physically strong. Right. You know, how much of a difference did you feel fighting him in a Moitai fight and fighting him in glory?

Speaker 3:          02:24:26       Um, I didn't really notice that much of a difference, to be honest with you because I was in a lot better shape and for the A and lot more prepared for the, for the last man standing thing. But I think it also forced him. He had to, he wasn't able to hold on the way he wanted to and to do what he wanted to do. So I think it's unfair for me to say it if it was, I don't know. That was a really good fun. I enjoy it. It's great fight for you. I really liked and I always thought that a glory rules with elbows would be really interesting. Like even if he didn't allow the clench, but you're loud elbows because elbows are actually my favorite weapon. That's how I got my, my ring name. Most of my first 10 knockouts were by elbow or from like knee to the head. From the clinch. Yeah. I think it's a great tactic. It's a very great technique I think. I don't know why they don't do it honestly. And then k one they didn't do it because Japan isn't like big on the blood thing. So maybe that was why know they stop fights and wiped the blood off, all that stuff. But uh, I really love elbows and like people get guys like Nathan carnage more. Sure.

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       Yeah. He was like the elbow God was like, Oh yeah, beautiful boxing ability and the sneaking in the elbows, you know, I, I'm a big fan of the elbow. Yeah. And I think that those guys, when they're fighting and kickboxing as opposed to Moy Tai, there's like an element of their game that they've worked so hard to, to adapt and to, to get proficient at. And then that element's been removed. You're forcing them to fight it like 70%. Exactly. Yeah. And this happened in with, with Simon, you know, in that fight with me. And that was his first fight. His first loss was his first kick boxing fight. First knockout loss was the first key proxy fight. And then this one that just happened was also in kickboxing or San shall rules or whatnot. Yeah. Oh, it was tan shall rule secret. Wink. When lung fung or so San showered, you're allowed to throw takedowns and stuff.

Speaker 2:          02:26:09       I don't know really know about that. I mean they call, it seems like San show, but they call it something that weanling fung. Um, I did it once and it was horrible for me is actually when I tore my knee apart. Um, but it was like you're allowed to judo throw or like, uh, but, but somehow they were yelling at Simon when he was trying to clinch and I don't really understand it. What do you think about what John Wayne Pars doing that cage combat thing? He's got like, he's, he's like got Moitai but they're fighting in a cage with like MMA gloves. I particularly don't care for it. I mean, I don't like, um, I think it's, it's, I just see it as a gimmick over trying to tap into the MMA scene. I mean, like we just talked about the cage. It makes it really hard to see. I don't think that you can clinches well against the cage as you can in the ropes because you couldn't move them backwards.

Speaker 2:          02:26:56       And I think it's more about like a, just attaching the gimmick or making it more brutal than, you know, thing that, and I think a lot of guys or a breaking their hands with the little gloves, those little gloves doing it. I wouldn't, I wouldn't want to do it defensively. It's a big issue, right, with the little gloves so we don't slip punches through where you can't, you know, I thought it was going to be, and then when I started training for the Melvin fight it, I didn't find that much difference. Um, although I think if I had, if Bella had a boxing glove on, it hit me on top of the head there. It might another put my legs out and I might not have dropped as as easily as I did. Um, I don't know if Melvin would have went down from that right hook with a boxing glove as, as dramatically as he did.

Speaker 2:          02:27:39       Did Glory adopt k one rules just because k one was like the big organization to k one started to fall off and then it's, showtime came along and it, showtime put up some really big fights. And then Gloria kind of came along and took that over. I think that's, that's uh, exactly what happened. I think that, uh, the, from what I understand that guys k one was k one and then most of the fighters from Holland were under one management team. And uh, when k one started to fail, that management team had all the contracts for the k one guys and they started it showtime because they already had all the fighters in a contract. And then when it's showtime, um, eventually sold to a

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       glory that the company glory and then they, so they, it was just like same people, same scenario. It just grew from that. And then now it's um, you know,

Speaker 4:          02:28:31       so lion fight is the only really big moy promotion like national on television, national more type promotion. Yes.

Speaker 3:          02:28:37       Country. I think legacy fighting just got, just made a deal. Um, it was on TV and on their own and be access as well.

Speaker 4:          02:28:43       Oh, their access to interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Access is fucking great man. Which used to be HD net. It's like one of the best accesses or best ways to access like up and coming fighters and like the smaller organizations.

Speaker 3:          02:28:56       Right. Uh, I think uh, yeah, I don't get that channel. I remember with HD net was on there, then they had the MMA MMA shows with her on h was it WEC was on each thing then?

Speaker 4:          02:29:08       No, it was um, up in Canada. The fuck's his name.

Speaker 3:          02:29:13       Oh God damn it. I can't remember in Edmonton. You know what I'm talking about the dude. But uh, now, um, and you remember what your spike TV when the UFC was still on it and had the ultimate fighter that was like the kind of the home for combat sports. And I know that a spike TV is now a ending I think in March and they just signed a spike. TV's rebranding like or re self and like the change in the name. No, a rebranding. They're changing, they're revitalizing their look or something. I don't know. They're trying to get back to being the home for combat sports. I know they just signed a deal with the Floyd Mayweather is a manager. They may have boxing, they're gonna have boxing on, uh, on Spike TV now too. Oh yeah. They're having like golden glory, right.

Speaker 4:          02:29:59       I mean, not golden glory. A golden boy, golden boy productions is going to be on a spike TV if it's and golden. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:30:05       Boy, it's a I'm Floyd Mayweather's coach. I forget what they're going to call it. What's Al Haymon um, is promoting it. And then so now they're going to have boxing kickboxing and you know, Bella Torben may on spike, which is really, that's beautiful. The good for a cause. That's their Devindra, the demographic, you know, it was, it was all kind of geared around the ultimate fighter and all their shows were like the same. Um, I think from my perspective, so

Speaker 4:          02:30:28       I think it's great. I think that, you know, the more, the better. I just think they just changed. Name belter yeah. Fucking like goofy name. What do you think better? What does it mean fuck is a Bella tour? How to even spell it? Is it one l I spell it wrong. And every time. I love the fights. I love the organization. But the Chicago just spike TV, MMA, it's fun. It's mixed martial arts. Everybody knows what it is. It's just why, you know, like when you watch boxing, it's not, you know, the funder Phis boxing right now. Like why have, the name is the UFC? Like when it comes to MMA, UFC is like NFL, right? It's got that. It's like cute tips and Kleenex. You know, you don't want, you don't ask for a tissue. You, hey, give me a kleenex. You know, give me a cue tip.

Speaker 4:          02:31:09       You don't ask me. I have a cotton swab. You know what I mean? It's like they become names. Like I'll have a coke. Like, you know? Yeah. It becomes like, I think velcro was actually a patent, isn't it? I don't know, but no, exactly. Why a father-in-law's in the army and they don't call it velcro. It's called something else. Can loop, hook and loop or something because of old crow is a brand. Right. So it was the same thing, right? Yeah. But that said, MMA is what it is. Everybody knows it's mixed martial arts, you know. And I think that if they just went with MMA, you know, just have MMA on Spike TV, have the name of the fighters be the the what's important, you know, I think Bella tore this, the name itself is kind of goofy in the fucking helmet. Like why is it a Roman guy with a helmet?

Speaker 4:          02:31:53       Was that or did that come about around the 300 thing? Cause it seems very thorough. We have to ask. It is kind of kind of, I think it's a Roman thing, the the name, but whatever. Maximum fighting championship was what I was trying to go. Remember. MFC, mark paviches organization would shop in Edmonton, which is another good thing to watch where like you see a lot of like Ryan, Jim, Oh came out of there a lot of young up and coming guys that are really good fighters came out with these hg net fights and they step put on back in the day. So if, if, if spike can do that and just make it like the home for fighting, like every Friday night boxing and MMA kickboxing people will get programmed if they just stick with Gloria. I feel like a can't miss. Yeah. It's just a matter of promoting it correctly.

Speaker 4:          02:32:38       Getting people to understand like these, these are the best kick boxers on earth and it's super high level shit. It's not like, you know, they're just learning how to kickbox we're putting them on TV. Like these are the best of the best. Do you think in there needs to be more Americans fighting for American audience to a cause? I hear that a lot and I don't know. I mean I read that. Are we that some people, I don't know if we were that way or not. Some people are, yeah, there's a lot of us go, I don't want to watch this Turkish guy cause it's Turkish liar. Fucking American flag on a short, send them out that don't want them talk. They'll talk, they'll do that. They'll fucking, you'll get caught. Well listen man, I know you must have to pee. You've been holding onto that water?

Speaker 4:          02:33:20       I do. I know you do. And uh, this weekend, this Friday night, um, folks who couldn't watch it, it's going to be live on spike TV. It's glory 19. And where's it is from Virginia, Hampton, Virginia, Hampton, Virginia Colosseum I think, um, is is a huge event. If you've never watched kickboxing before it, let this be your first one and definitely cheer from my man Joe Schilling who will be fighting in the Co main event of the evening.
