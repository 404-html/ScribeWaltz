Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. What I'm hoping the book will do in the long run is that it will lead to more attention being focused on the Americas. This is a very neglected area of the world. Uh, as far as deep and ancient archeology goes, I'm, it's, the recent history of the Americas has been relatively well studied, but the deep and ancient history has not been, has not been well studied, and I think America is going to contain revelations for us about our story and about our past. And I'm serious when I, when I suggest that America is the most plausible and the most likely homebase for a lost civilization. If you're going to propose a lost civilization, you need, there are certain preconditions, you need a, you can't have it on a small island. There's got to be a large landmass mass with enormous resources and the ability for population to grow and for those resources to be, to be mobilized.

Speaker 1:          00:58          And what I suddenly realized, you asked earlier why I, why I started to write this book at all is what the new evidence is pointing to is that the Americans have been wrongly neglected. That here we have a giant continental land mass with extraordinary resources that has just been ruled out of the story of human civilization. But once we take account of the fact that there was a giant cataclysm over North America 12,000, 800 years ago, and once we start looking as I do in America before at the incredible deep indepth similarities between, for example, the religious system of ancient Egypt and the religious system of the Mississippi Valley, then you realize that you're into, uh, into a global mystery here and that the answer to that mystery may not at all be in the old world and may very much be, uh, in the, in the Americas.

Speaker 1:          01:48          See, it's odd. I mentioned Mountville earlier on. It's kind of odd that we should find a, what is essentially the ancient Egyptian religion, uh, manifesting in the symbolism of Mountville, the ascent to Orion that transit to the Milky Way, the journey along the Milky Way. Very, these are very specific and idiosyncratic ideas. And what makes it doubly ARD is Mountville isn't that old. Mountville as a site is about a thousand years old. Ancient Egypt had already been gone completely from the world, uh, for at least 600 years before Manville was created. The end of ancient Egypt. There's, there's Mountville and uh, w w what we're looking at in the foreground is mount B and we're looking at mount day and the in the, in the distance, um, and, and the complete circle of mounds. What w what is odd about it is we find the system of ancient Egyptian ideas in Manville 500 years after ancient Egypt has gone from the world.

Speaker 1:          02:46          The Romans, the Romans were the end of ancient Egypt by 400 ancient Egypt has gone. Marrickville doesn't even exist then, but 600 years later it is created and it manifests the set of ancient Egyptian ideas. Clearly it did not get that as a result of direct transmission from ancient Egypt unless they were time travelers. The only way I think it could have got it is as a result of a legacy passed down from a much earlier civilization that has influenced and affected many different parts of the world and the characteristics of that civilization, the shamanistic heart of it, the use of altered states of consciousness. The focus on those are amongst the reasons that I would suggest that America is the place that we should be looking and the big mysteries are in the areas that were so devastated at the end of the last ice age up in the north of North America, the channeled scab lands in particular and then the Mississippi Valley. The whole story of the Mississippi Valley. Yes, Mountville as a thousand years old, but then you can go back to poverty point in Louisiana, which is 2,700 years old. You can go to Watson break in Louisiana, which is 5,000, 500 years old. You can go to sites like Conley, which are 8,000 years old. The system keeps on going back and disappearing back into time. And I think the most fruitful new work on exploring the origins of civilization is going to occur counterintuitively, uh, in the Americas, the very last place on earth that archeologists have ever thought

Speaker 2:          04:15          thought to look when it's a funny thing because you know, in can 1987, you know, I was 17 and I was gang banging, I got shot and you know, that I got hit by a 22 and it as hollow points do it. Um, it, it broke into three, three pieces, the hollow point. And one of them pro punctured my lung on my left side. And, uh, you know, they were telling me, well, you know, do you smoke? No, I don't really smoke because I didn't smoke cigarettes. I smoked weed, but I wasn't going to divulge that at the time. I was 17 and you know, and uh, they said, well, you know, well that's good because you'll never smoke again. It was like you'd do, they punctured your lung and blah, blah, blah. They thought I was going to have to work off one lung but in the three days, you know, they were able to get the blood out of the lung and I was able to get it back, you know, through the exercises they told me, you know, to get it back to its regular size and I've never had a problem since then.

Speaker 2:          05:22          Knock on wood, the piece of metal out. No, I still got the three pieces. That's like when I go do my physicals and they do the, you know, the Mri, the Mris and the x rays and all that. The doctors, you know, sometimes they forget because they see so many patients. Mr Freeze, um, these appeared to be bullet fragments with, what is that? Well, you just said it, doctor bullet, frank. You've seen him a dozen times, you know, and uh, yeah, I, I was very lucky. I was very lucky because, you know, punctured my lung. And then two of the pieces, one was by the heart and when was by my spine, but I was at a Martin Luther King Hospital in Linwood. And we call that place killer king because you go in there for something small and ended up dying or come out, you know, gift out or something.

Speaker 2:          06:10          So you know, I wasn't going to allow them to try and get to those bullets or those fragments to open you up. Yeah. Not An ah, cause you know, they didn't have a great success rate. What kind of lung exercises they give. You try to pump your lungs, but they give you this breathing apparatus that has like a ball in it, right. And it has two lines and you know, it's the first line you're trying to, they're telling you every day for five minutes, 10 minutes to blow that, you know, not all in one shot, but like to keep practicing getting the ball up there and that will then help inflate the lung and get it back. So I had to do that for probably like three weeks. And, uh, you know, the puncture wound, it healed itself pretty much. And uh, and the pieces are still in your lungs?

Speaker 2:          06:59          Not In the law. No, it's, it, it went passed along. It did shot passed along. So you know, it's uh, I got a piece up here and one off to the side in the back. Well when it's really cold due to the nerve damage, I'll get like stinging like you know, like when your, when your hand falls asleep, the little needles that, I'll get that here and then, and then back here where it entered, they had to, they had to cut right in between a rib here to stick the tube in to put the hose into the lung to get the blood out of the lung. Yeah. As you know, I was living crazy before I got into the music. The music saved my life

Speaker 3:          07:39          pretty much. So after high school I started touring and uh, that's when like I started getting my heaviest. We were eating fast food every single day, three times a day, never drink water, soda, only smoking like a pack and a half of cigarettes a day. And just on the road traveling. And then, uh, by 19, I got up to 305 pounds, 19 years old. And I remember one night laying down to go to bed and I just felt my heart pumping ridiculous Lee. And I was just like, no way. This is like, I think I'm going to die. And like I've woke up in a panic and weird thing is I got up and I went outside for maybe like 10 minutes and I smoked another cigarette and I was just like, this is the problem. Like I'm coughing up stuff my hardest going to give out and I'm only 19 years old, you know.

Speaker 3:          08:29          So around that same week is when I discovered MMA with my brother, just like watching ultimate fighter on TV. And so, uh, I went on my last tour and, uh, I told the guys like, Hey, I'm going to go train him and made it look, oh, you're going to be a fighter, like you think, you know? And I was just like, I don't know what I'm going to be, but I'm going to go train and get healthy. And they were like, okay, cool. We'll see you in a couple of months. You know what I mean? Like, no one really believed that I was going to go and actually train and fight. I told you I, well, he's been like this big quiet nonconfrontational guys. So, um, yeah, I went and took my first class Moyie Thai and March 1st, 2010 took my first Muay Thai class and then after like a month of doing Muay Thai, I started to see progression.

Speaker 3:          09:12          I started to see like my face was slimming down all this stuff. So it gave me motivation to keep going. And then, um, I remember going to a MMA event, amateur, and I saw really big heavyweight guys going at it. So I was like, oh, I think I want to do it. I want to give it a shot. And, uh, so my coach was like, okay, if you lose a hundred pounds, I'll like, I'll find you a fight. And I was like, a hundred pounds. He's like, yeah, I'll find you a fight if you lose a hundred pounds. So, um, I just kept training within 11 months, lost a hundred pounds, and then took my first fight. And then she felt like every fight has been until now because it's like now I have like more of a drive and a passion for it, but all the way up until then, everything kind of happened by coincidence or just like, I just, I didn't really want to fight, but I had a lot of people like, oh, you're so good.

Speaker 3:          10:00          Like keep doing it. And I was the first time in my life I've ever had people supporting me to like really do something that was big and I was a new guy and I was in shape and I can, you know, girls are noticing me now. I'm like all either, my whole life changed within a year of training MMA. Like wow, from going to this guy that nobody even paid attention to, to just like, oh, hey, how's it going? Are you know, like, oh, you're so in shape. And I was just like, oh, this is weird. It's still weird. It's only been nine years, eight years, you know? So everything is still very new to me. I've only, my first day stepping on the mat was like, you know, nine years, years ago,

Speaker 4:          10:38          I got to beat him to be the best, right. So I need to work hard. What's your, what's your take on him? You can't take away what he does in the sport. What does his outside his personal life, that's all he say. She say, I have my words after to the California stuff. We went to two 26 or whatever it was in Vegas and got moved here. Cause his lifestyle and drug tests and all the extra stuff, however you want to code it up, his past, you know, I'm done. What about, I had my words there, the fact that you kept using God and Jesus and this, this and this and I'm a god fearing God. Read my Bible every morning and I don't like the fact that you can, that he would do that. I'm like I said I want it now, but at the time my words was the fact that he did that.

Speaker 4:          11:16          And then at the same time I want to interview in this. I want to thank God and it's, that kind of rubbed me wrong. And then we flew on a plane together and like I said, I saw the way he was acting when he came on a plane. Like we not doing this because of him, like all that at a time bothering me. And I was a pent up any and now something else going into that fight. That was something on my shoulders because I had posted something because when a UFC called me right before I got on the flight, I was like, oh, don't come a the way to Vegas now I got my wife, she's eight months pregnant, she's 30 weeks, whatever. She can't travel after this. She's struggling. We hauled them bags and Y'all call me and I'll say, don't come this and this.

Speaker 4:          11:47          Go back home. We're gonna fly you out again. Like I'm not doing this again. And then when they get to the, well we can get you here, but we get you Cali, but we can't take your wife like what? Like, well you, we pay your ticket and coach ticket like no, fuck that all because Jon Jones is that, that's what got me mad. That's what they're trying to save money. Pretty much flying people because we was literally walking down the wrong way to the plane. When they call him the cheese can I turn around? But then when we got it like okay you come here but we can get you to Cali but we can get to your wife to Cali. Like my wife is 30 weeks pregnant. She's here when she's coming like, well we don't know what to do because you bought her ticket isn't it?

Speaker 4:          12:21          Like what do you mean you don't know what to do? Get her nose ticket. Like I paved my family. What about the people that's on the way right now? Like all they got to find their own way and that made me weak week fight week of the fight. The thing of the things that you have to think about, you know, talking with that, that's the last thing I was worried about God and then I get there and they said, when you get, make sure you got your workout. If you don't have your workout, schedule the Pie set already. As soon as you get there, go do it. I did mine like a month and a half ahead of time. I'm like I said, I'm puncturing. Like I like having stuff done. Yeah, come get ready to go into Pr. I'm packing my bags and I get a call. Oh, you can't come to the API.

Speaker 4:          12:56          Why? John just came in and said he went to work out so we closed the gym down. You're not allowed. Oh, y'all called me two months ago. Told me to set my schedule to come ahead of time. I'm really getting ready to walk to my Uber that's outside and you say, I can't come now. Like I sorry. And then we can do is John, why can't you work out at the same place with John's work and not fighting for the same thing with kindness? It on. I'm there in the summer and kind of show up. They're coming into there, but you gotta leave. Wow. Just rode it. Yeah. Really? You all gotten kindness? I was car parked up on the sidewalk. Come on. Yeah. They have security guards to block the stairs off and everything. I don't want no special treatment from her or from anybody. If I was a champ, treat me the same. You know what I mean? Is some people are different, I guess. I don't know if it's John or his camp that was doing that or UFC is doing or security or what, but it rubbed me wrong that we aren't equal anymore.

Speaker 5:          13:50          Okay.
