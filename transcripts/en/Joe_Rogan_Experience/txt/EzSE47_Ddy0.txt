Speaker 1:          00:00          Drive by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day. I always find a way to get my shit together and dig myself out of situations and like ultimately rise above situation. Beautiful as long as you don't count on it right now where I'm sick of getting in my own way and like, like UFC 200. Let's talk about that. I literally what happened, I did everything that I could to be back in a position to win that belt back. I was getting ready to show this triumphant amazing story of someone who she's made it through a hit and run situation, had almost had everything taken from them and got it all back. And then, um, and then, um, I'm sorry, I have, I'm, I'm thinking about so many things at once. What happened? Um,

Speaker 2:          00:52          so let's just talk about what happened. You, you tested

Speaker 3:          00:54          positive

Speaker 2:          00:55          for some estrogen inhibitors, Sgl blockers yesterday and blockers that a lot of people associate with people who take steroids, right? People take steroids, they want to restart their system or if you want to testosterone boost, you take clomid or clomiphene and these are, these are standard drugs in the steroid users world.

Speaker 1:          01:17          Yeah. This is on new for me. Yeah. Um, basically what did you take? So I took a, I took an offbrand cialis pill. Offbrand it was, it wasn't extra Cialis, but it was described to me as being a cialis. And so I thought it was a Cialis and I, I just took it. So why does a guy like you need cialis? Have a huge got jail that's too big. It's too big. That's a good answer.

Speaker 3:          01:46          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:47          We don't have the resources to get it normally. Uh, yeah. You know, I um, you were of, no, it wasn't even necessarily a party and no, I, I've taken like a melon harassment before and for people who haven't taken it and you literally, you know, you go from being like that to just, it puts the twist at the end of the punch list. You know what I mean? It, it like, it.

Speaker 3:          02:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:11          it's a good time. You know, I had to go to be a quote. It's a good time now. What was this like? One of them's gas station. Rhino

Speaker 3:          02:23          pills?

Speaker 1:          02:24          No, I had an edit teammate basically tell me, hey, uh, he was talking about how his girlfriend's a pharmacist and, and he, he's capable of getting all this stuff and, and all that type of stuff. And I was like, wow, I don't do, I don't do drugs or anything like that. And he's like, you ever take a Seattle said? I was like, yeah. He's like, I got to Cialis. And I was like, well, you said you don't do drugs or anything like that, but you would done drugs. Well, yeah, yeah, but no, he was talking about all these painkillers and all this different shit. Other things on top that he has because his girlfriend's a pharmacist and I, and he was getting this off brand stuff from, it's like, I dunno, people get a lot

Speaker 2:          03:00          of stuff from China. I mean that's what happened with Anderson. Anderson got liquid cialis from China and it was tainted. Yeah. Look, this happens. I know for a fact, and it mean everyone knows for a fact that happens. The supplement industry has a giant issue with the people that mix the stuff. Like if you have a VAT and you're mixing up whatever creatine or something like that. And right before, I mean, if this is done in some country or some place, it doesn't have excellent standards. It's not scrupulous. You could be scooping up steroids in the batch before that and you just throw the creatine in it and some of it gets contaminated and they don't clean it. Yeah, that's pretty much, uh, log. I'll get to that, but okay. So you take this off brand Cialis, the guys like, do you ever, do you ever do less

Speaker 1:          03:41          flaggers and all that stuff? And I'm like, yeah, I've, you know, I've, I've had melly hairspray pills before and he's like, oh, I got cialis. And I'm like, oh, this is great. So I ended up taking one of the cialis pills and, um, um, and I thought everything was fine and dandy. I had no clue. Um, what Ha, you know, that I, that I was now having something else to me that was illegal. I took at the Seattle Spiel on June the 14th, June 16th, um, you side came over to my house, six o'clock in the morning. Hey, what's up guys? That coffee going off her and everybody, water bottles, Super Nice, hospitable, come in, um, laughing and joking with them. I had no clue that that's test was going to be the test that derail my life. And um, you know, right before UFC 200, uh, my manager mouth, he calls me over to his hotel room and he's like, Hey, I want to talk to you man, and that what's going on?

Speaker 1:          04:35          And he's like, Hey, you're not going to be fighting. What are you talking about? It's like, you know, you didn't feel, you didn't pass your drug test and uh, the level of hurt and just, and confusion and I literally had an anxiety attack and I had never had one of those before. What does that feel like? I felt like the whole room just came in on me. Like the whole room came down on me and I was just, I couldn't breathe. I remember opening up his hotel window looking for a balcony so I could just breathe and realized that I'm like not trapped. Um, there's little, the window opened that much.

Speaker 2:          05:12          What the fuck? So you don't jump out hotel in Vegas? Where was it? Vegas fucking brick and I'm breathing. They don't want gamblers or sleeping

Speaker 1:          05:20          back in. I'm breathing through the thing, calm myself down. And um, and I instantly started thinking about the weight of the, I had the weight of the world literally on my back. I knew that, I knew that I wasn't going to be fighting a few hours before everyone else knew. The public knew and I was just, I could already start hearing everything. Even my own coaches, we're looking at me like just their hearts were on the floor. Like I had done so much to get back to fighting at UFC 200, like getting my life in order, getting the people around me in order, getting my head, my health, my mind. You just being in order to, to beat DC and, and like literally right now I've done so much, so much of the right things to be back in a good position. And right now, you know, people look at me as if I still don't have my shit together. But the only thing that I did was I took a pill that I thought was going to give me a boner and literally it's caused me a lot of heartache and a lot of disappointment and a lot of, and it just threw me

Speaker 2:          06:25          here in any way, shape or form. When someone gives you this pill and you don't know where it came from, you don't know. What did you think, man? I don't know what's in this.

Speaker 1:          06:32          No, I didn't. No, I didn't think of it because, um, I had been dealing with the athletic commission. I've been in the UFC for a long time and I've taken a little gas station, Dick Pills before, like, you know, like, and I've never felt the drug test ever. But then you, did you ever think that you might've gotten lucky? No, I didn't think I got lucky. I thought that you felt drug test when you're doing sketchy shit.

Speaker 2:          06:54          Right. But didn't you think there might be some sketchy shit, some Chinese, no. Station Rhino. Dick pill. I, I, um, what do you know about the rhinos? My friend Ryan, my friend Brian called it, he was on the, on the podcast. He said, you know, John Likes to party. I bet he took one of them. Did

Speaker 1:          07:08          pills. Um, no. Um, that's funny. He called it. Yeah. Well he, he was, he was on, I haven't, I've taken him several times before and with the Nevada State Athletic Commission, um, I always pass my drug test and, and I know that I would never do anything to cheat this sport. I have a lot of pride in my work ethic and knowing that dude, I look, I've been skinny my whole career, whooping people's ass. I'm not a knockout artist. I wouldn't because I'm smart and you know, I work hard. Um, but with you, with the nod, Nevada athletic commission, I never had an issue. And then I was suspended when you cited came. So I was never really educated on how serious you shot. It really was like I um, I came back into the game and there's like, Oh hey, we got this new company name and each side of instead of Nevada.

Speaker 1:          08:04          What were you suspended for when you saw the king? Oh, I'm into this sport. I understand what you're saying. When we came into your house, so when you started came into the sport, I was used to spend it because my hit and run and so I never had even met anyone who worked for you that I, I'd never been sat down. I know you signed a seminar, what to do and what not to do and how serious it is and what could happen if you do this. And only thing I knew it was I had to report where I was at. Like if I go to La for the weekend, I got a little sad to know that I'm in La because they can drug test me at anytime. That's the only thing I really knew about. You saw the, I didn't know that doing something that I had done several times before. It could ultimately lose me a fight. So, um, the only difference was I had taken like little gas station pills aren't, I've taken viagara before. This was, this teammate gave me something that was Seattle is I thought the only thing that it would do is make me bigger and stronger for longer. That's all I thought was going to be happening. Right. I, and then when I find out that, that I had just failed the drug test.

Speaker 2:          09:01          Do you know that via Viagara is a actually illegal in the Olympics? I didn't know that. You can't take that stuff. The Viagra is a performance enhancer though. It's a Vasso dilator, I believe. I believe that's how they describe it. And it actually has athletic performance enhancing pro, um, properties to it. How does it, how does it help you? I don't know. We'd have to look into that, but I think it, it's similar to, in a lot of ways to nitric oxide supplement. Like a PR, like a pre workout. Get your, yeah. Yeah. I mean it does something to open up your blood cells and get you pumped. I mean, it does something not just to your Dick, but to all of your muscle.

Speaker 1:          09:36          Hmm. Yeah. I don't know if I would want it to be pumped up during a fight. I don't think it works that way. I mean, I don't, I don't, I think it actually can possibly potentially help endurance. Well, yeah, I know, but I know that athletes take it for that reason. That's why it's banned from the Olympics. Yeah. But, um, but yeah, you know, I understand that it wasn't your intention. It was not my intention. I had no, I had no clue that I needed to report this to your side of it because I thought, you know, literally I was reporting everything else. What supplements, what preworkout what, you know, my amino acids, my protein powder, like you saw it, it had all my stuff. And what happens once you find out? Did you, how'd you narrow it down to this pill? I literally, I went through my supplements and I, um, handed it to, I hired that private lab in the lawyer and we started handing it, giving them everything that I took, which isn't really a lot of stuff at all. You know, stuff that everyone should take. Fish oil, basic, basic supplements, protein, protein powder, fish oil, um, you know, liver cleanses or whatever. I'm just grape seed extract, that kind of stuff. Yeah. Just very, you know, multivitamins for men, Beijing. Very basic stuff. Okay. And um, and then, and then get nutrition and it's like, you know, we, we've scanned all of our stuff. We know it's not from that gut nutrition website though. It's fucking hilarious.

Speaker 2:          11:01          Got Nutrition website. The moment we found out about it that someone said, John sponsored by Gat Nutrition. So we've, oh, hey, well let's check that out. Get nutrition. There's some fucking dude is,

Speaker 1:          11:11          they have a lot of great, great products that you want to get big and strong and then you can definitely go to them, you know? But as soon as we saw that, we were like, what in the holy fuck is he taking? Oh, no, no, I mean, but people saw you, you got gigantic, huge, completely, completely, uh, completely unnatural. I, that's what I have great pride in being a natural athlete. But, um, but uh, so they got, they got all the cat stuff, test it and clear, right. Everything was clear. Um, this gets to have other things that you saw don't regulate. Absolutely. But the things that they gave me they were super smart about and I, all the products I was thinking with clear and um, and so my manager was like, think outside of the box. Like did you take anything that could have possibly been?

Speaker 1:          11:59          And I was like, I don't think so. Then I was like, well, one of my teammates did give me this, this dick pill. And he's like, I need those. So we got those pills tested and sure enough, they and their ingredients, they listed about five products in their ingredients and they actually, uh, there was actually like seven products too that weren't listed in the ingredients. The two estrogen blockers were never in their ingredients. So, um, it was a tainted pill. It was what I'm saying. Yes. So, um, so the [inaudible] was able to tell, okay, this was totally in attention or there's no engine, no way in Hell I'm John would take these estrogen blockers and purpose. First of all, it was very small traces. So it wasn't like I was loaded up with estrogen blockers. And why the fuck would they put estrogen blockers out?

Speaker 1:          12:58          We believe that, uh, the factory that created these, uh, these Dick Pills, um, were maybe manufacturing these pills in a dirty laboratory or whatever. And there were because of this container just tainted. Yes. Because each pill that we, that we had tested, some of them had more estrogen blocker, some had almost no estrogen blockers, some had small traces. Actually none of the pills were consistent. So it was obvious that when we started, we tested several different packages. So it was obviously that, that these pills were probably getting made in the same machine and there was just traces, which is to show up in your system. We found some of these dick pills that had none, no estrogen blockers. They're like, damn, why did I get that? Yeah, exactly. So I took one that was just contaminated enough and literally I got tested two days later and it was in my system.

Speaker 1:          13:48          So it was, it was obvious that it was complete accident and even, and even if I were to report it, the Dick Pill to you side, uh, they would have read the label and the label would, it never said that it was extra blocker in there and I still would have had a dirty right. Entertainment contaminated. Where does that leave you? How much time did they suspend you for? I got suspended for, for a year from starting from back in July. So now I find in July of two subs, I love you shot up. I love what they're doing. I don't agree with things like that. I don't agree with things like that. Because what you took does not enhance your performance. No, it doesn't. It's especially in such a trace amount. I feel like in certain circumstances, like there's been several fighters like Chad Mendez. Um, he has, uh, I believe he has eczema.

Speaker 2:          14:33          He was taking an Eczema cream that had some sort of a, was it a hormone precursor or a hormone? Peptide? I believe some sort of a hormone peptide. I think that enhances, uh, the, the use of this

Speaker 1:          14:49          cream. I don't, I don't the full, I'm

Speaker 2:          14:52          obviously not a doctor or a scientist, but there's something about suspending someone for something like that. That seems ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          15:00          Yeah. Well in my situation, they, they, the, the evening you start his lawyer, he showed, he showed a little bit of remorse. I can, I can feel that he felt bad about what was happening to me cause I think he can really, even the arbitrators, they could tell what had actually happened, but their problem was they said Janet was just negligent. Like you didn't, you should have reported this pill.

Speaker 2:          15:26          But that's it seems to me that's silly. That means that,

Speaker 1:          15:29          but even if I would have reported the pill, they would have read the ingredients and they would've never saw that there was a trace of, of something that wasn't advertised. So

Speaker 2:          15:37          spend someone for something like,

Speaker 1:          15:38          because they, because they said it, there was zero tolerance policy. It was just like I was the first fighter to ever take them to into arbitration and, and they were more upset that I didn't let them know that I took the pill. Then what actually happened was like the rule is you tell us what you take and we can point you in a different direction. Right. But I never told him when I took, my whole argument was even if I told you what I took, right, it's still was never on the label. So unless you guys were going to spend all the money to take it to a private law or tickets to a laboratory to test this individual pill, you get what I'm saying? I still don't ran into the same situation.

Speaker 2:          16:14          I think it's great to protect people from people that cheating. I don't think it's great to punish someone for taking something that has a trace amount of something that does the absolutely no benefit whatsoever and clearly and wasn't supposed to be in that pill and wasn't supposed to be in that pill and clearly wasn't being taken to enhance athletic performance. Right. That seems silly. It seems like a mess. Right? It seems like a mass that, I mean, I, I understand their zero tolerance policy. I don't agree with it in this war, the Chad Mendez situation, you know, there's, there's weird ones like Yoel Romero, he tested positive for something. They found out that it was a, in one of the protein powders or something he was taking, it wasn't supposed to be in there. It wasn't listed that way and they gave him an abbreviated sentence.

Speaker 1:          16:54          He should have had no, no, no parts whatsoever. But um, I mean, my whole thing, Joe, is I'm so grateful. I'm still optimistic, man. I'm always looking for light in every situation. Um,

Speaker 1:          17:08          and I think that's the way I deal with things. I just, I'm always trying. I always believe there's going to be good at the end of the day. That's just how I am. I'm just so grateful where most people would be so upset with themselves and all this type of stuff. I'm really not, I'm upset about the fans that I let down who flew out to UFC 200 and things like that. But as far as the whole situation, I'm just glad that that my ne, my name would no longer be associated with steroids. I rather it be bowling or boy or whatever you want to call me. You know, whatever you want to call me. But steroids that that was, that would have really, that was really bothering me, so I'm just glad that it's out. What actually happened

Speaker 4:          17:47          [inaudible].
