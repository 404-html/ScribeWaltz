Speaker 1:          00:00          Try My day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. I always find a way to get my shit together and, and dig myself out of a situations and like, and ultimately rise above beautiful as long as you don't count on it right now where I'm sick of getting in my own way and like, like UFC 200. Let's talk about that. I literally what happened. I did everything that I could to be back in the position to win that belt back. I was getting ready to show this triumphant amazing story of someone who she's made it through a hit and run situation. It had almost had everything taken from them and got it all back. And then, um, and then, um, I'm sorry, I'm thinking about so many things at once. Might have been.

Speaker 2:          00:52          So let's just talk about what happened. You, you tested positive for some estrogen inhibitors or blockers yesterday and blockers that a lot of people associate with people who take steroids. People take steroids and you want to restart their system. Or if you want a testosterone boost, you take clomid or clomiphene and these are, these are standard drugs in the steroid users world.

Speaker 1:          01:17          Yeah. This is, yeah. All new for me. Yeah. Um, basically what did you take? So I took a, I took an offbrand Cialis bill off brand. It was, it wasn't actual Cialis, but it was described to me as being a cialis. And so I thought it was a Cialis and I, I just took it. So why is it guy like you need. Seattle's have a huge God, Jo. It's too big. It's too big. It's a good answer.

Speaker 1:          01:47          We don't have the resources to get it normally. Just, yeah. You know, I um, you were partying. No, it wasn't even necessarily party and know I've taken like a melon hazmatt before and for people who haven't taken it, you literally, you know, you go from being like that to just. It puts the twist at the end of the punch list at the end. You know what I mean? Is it like, it, it, it's, it's a good time, you know, it's a good time to be a quote. That's a good time. Now. Um, what was this like? One of them's gas station, right?

Speaker 3:          02:23          Pills. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:24          No, I had an edit teammate basically tells me, hey, uh, he was talking about how his girlfriend's a pharmacist and he, he's capable of getting all this stuff and, and all that type of stuff. And I was like, wow, I don't do drugs or anything like that. And he's like, you ever take a seattle? Yeah. So I was like, yeah. He's like, I got to see Alice. And I was like, well, you said you don't do drugs or anything like that, but you would done drugs. Well, yeah. Yeah. But no, he was talking about all these painkillers and all this different shit than other things on top of that he has because his girlfriend's a pharmacist and he was, she getting this off brand stuff from. It's like, I don't know, people get a lot

Speaker 2:          03:00          of stuff from China. I mean that's what happened with Anderson. Anderson got liquid cialis from China and it was tainted. Look, this happens. I know for a fact that, I mean everyone knows for a fact that happens. The, the supplement industry has a giant issue with the people that mix the stuff, like if you have a VAT and you're mixing up whatever, creatine or something like that and right before, I mean, if this is done in some country or some place that doesn't have excellent standards, it's not scrupulous. You could be scooping up steroids in the batch before that and you just throw the creatine in it and some of it gets contaminated if they don't clean it. Yeah. That's pretty much a while. I'll get to that. But. So you take this off brand Seattle guys, like do you ever. You ever do

Speaker 1:          03:41          flaggers and all that stuff? And I'm like, yeah, I've, you know, I've had melanoma pills before and he's like, oh, I guess yeah. I was like, oh, this is great. So I ended up taking one of the cialis pills and um, um, and I thought everything was fine and dandy. I had no clue what Ha, you know, that I, that I was now having something else. To me that was illegal. I took her to the bill on June the 14th of June, 16th. Um, you cited, came over to my house 6:00 in the morning. Hey, what's up guys? That coffee going offer and everybody water bottles. Super Nice, hospitable. Come in, laughing and joking with them. I had no clue that that test was going to be the test that derail my life. And um, you know, right before UFC 200, my manager now he calls me over to his hotel room and he's like, Hey, I want to talk to you man, like, what's going on?

Speaker 1:          04:35          He's like, Hey, you're not going to be fighting. Are you talking about? He's like, you know, you didn't feel you didn't pass your drug test and a, the level of her and just and confusion and I literally had an anxiety attack and I had never had one of those before. What does that feel like? I felt like the whole room just came in on me, like the whole room came down on me and I was just, I couldn't breathe. I remember opening up his hotel window looking for a balcony so I could just breathe and realize that I'm not trapped. Um, there's a little window opened that much

Speaker 2:          05:12          so you don't trump hotel in vegas where it was in Vegas. Fucking freak and I'm breathing. They don't want gamblers leaping through the years

Speaker 1:          05:20          back in. I'm breathing in through the thing, calm myself down. And um, and I instantly started thinking about the weight of the. I had the weight of the world literally on my back. I knew that. I knew that I wasn't going to be fighting a few hours before everyone else knew, the public knew and I was just, I could already start hearing everything. Even my uncle just been looking at me like just their hearts were on the floor. Like I had done so much to get back to fighting at UFC $200. Like get my life in order, getting the people around me in order to my, my health, my mind, you just being in order to beat DC. And, and like literally right now I've done so much. So much of the right things to be back in a good position and right now now people look at me as if I still don't have my shit together, but the only thing that I did was I took a pill, uh, that I thought was gonna give me a boner and it literally, it's caused me a lot of heartache and a lot of disappointment and a lot of just threw me

Speaker 2:          06:25          here in any way, shape or form. When someone gives you this pill and you don't know where it came from, you don't know. What did you think, man? I don't know what's in this.

Speaker 1:          06:32          No, I didn't. No, I didn't think of it because, um, I had been dealing with the athletic commission. I've been in the UFC for a long time and I've taken a little gas station, take pills before, like, you know, like, and I've never felt the drug test ever. Did you ever think that you might have got lucky? No, I didn't think I got lucky. I thought that you failed drug tests when you're doing sketchy shit.

Speaker 2:          06:54          Right? But didn't you think there might be some sketchy shit? And some Chinese, no station Rhino, Dick pill. I, I, um, what you know about the rhinos. My friend Ryan, my friend Brian called it, he was on the, on the podcast. He said, know John Likes to party. I bet he took one of them

Speaker 1:          07:08          pills. Um, no. Um, it's funny you called it. Yeah. Well he, he was, he was on. I haven't, I've taken them several times before. And with the Nevada State Athletic Commission, I always pass my drug test and, and I know that I would never do anything to keep this sport, have a lot of pride in my work ethic and knowing that dude, I've been skinny my whole career. Whooping people's ass. I'm not a knockout artist. I wouldn't because I'm smart and you know, I work hard. Um, but with you with the Knob, Nevada Athletic Commission, I never had an issue. And then I was suspended when you started came, so I was never really educated on how serious you shot a really was like, I um, I came back into the game and there's like, oh, hey, we've got this new company name and Usada instead of Nevada. What were you suspended for when you saw the king?

Speaker 1:          08:06          Oh, you mean when they come into the sport? I understand what you saying. You know, when they came into your house. So when you started came into the sport. I was looking because my head right. And so I never had even met anyone who worked for your side. I'd never been sat down. I know you started seminar, what to do and what not to do and how serious it is and what could have it if you do this. And only thing I knew is I had to report where I was at. Like if I go to La for the weekend, I got a little sad to know that I'm in La because like a drug spent anytime. That's the only thing I really knew about Usada. I didn't know that. Doing something that I had done several times before I could ultimately lose me a fight. So I'm. The only difference was I had taken like little gas station pills and I've taken by Agora before this was, this teammate gave me something that was Seattle is. I thought the only thing that it would do is make me bigger and stronger for longer. That's all I thought it was going to be happening and then when I find out that that I just failed the drug test.

Speaker 2:          09:01          Do you know that via Viagara is actually illegal in the Olympics. I didn't know that. Yeah. You can't take that stuff. The Viagra is a performance enhancer. Vaso dilator, I believe. I believe that's how they describe it and it actually has athletic performance enhancing properties to it. How does it, how does it help you? I don't know. We'd have to look into that, but I think it's similar in a lot of ways to nitric oxide supplement. Like a pro, like a pre workout. Get your. Yeah. Yeah. It does something to open up your blood cells and get you pumped. I mean, it does something not just to your Dick but to all of your muscle.

Speaker 1:          09:37          Yeah. I don't know if I would want it to be pumped up during a fight. I don't think it works that way. I mean, I don't. I think it actually can possibly potentially help endurance. Well, yeah, I know, but I know that athletes take it for that reason. That's why it's spanned from the Olympics. Yeah. But, um, but yeah, you know, I understand that it wasn't your intention. It was not my intention and I had no, I had no clue that I needed to report this to your side up because I thought, you know, literally I was reporting everything else. What supplements, what a pre workout, what, you know, my amino acids, protein powder, like you saw that had all my stuff. And what happens once you find out? Did you, how'd you narrow it down to this pill? I literally, I went through my supplements and I um, handed it to.

Speaker 1:          10:23          I hired a private lab in the lawyer and we started handing it, given them everything that I took, which isn't really a lot of stuff at all know stuff that everyone should take. Fish oil, basic basic supplements, protein, protein powder, fish oil, um, you know, liver cleanse that like or whatever. I'm just grapeseed extract, that kind of stuff. Very multivitamins for men, Beijing very basic stuff. And um, and then, and then get nutrition is like, you know, we, we've scanned all of our stuff. We know it's not from that gut nutrition website though, was fucking hilarious.

Speaker 2:          11:01          Gat Nutrition website at the moment we found out about it that someone said, John sponsored by Gat Nutrition. So we've, oh, let's check that out.

Speaker 1:          11:07          Get nutrition is some fucking dude. As soon as they have a lot of great, great products, but if you want to get big and strong and you can definitely go to them. But as soon as we saw that, we were like, what in the holy fuck is he taking? Oh No, I mean, but people saw you. You've got gigantic electronically. Completely, completely, completely natural. That's what I have great pride in being a natural athlete. But um, but uh, so they got, they got all the cat stuff, test it and clear, right? Everything was clear. Um, this gets to have other things that you don't regulate. Absolutely. But the things that they gave me, they're super smart about and uh, out in all the products I was thinking with clear and um, and so my managers, I think outside of the box I did you take anything that could have possibly been.

Speaker 1:          11:59          And I was like, I don't think so. Then I was like, well, one of my teammates did give me this pill and he's like, I need those. So where you got those pills tested and sure enough, they and their ingredients, they listed about five products and their ingredients. And they actually are, there's actually like seven products too that weren't listed in the ingredients. The two estrogen blockers were never in their ingredients. Um, so, um, it was a tainted pill. It would say what I'm saying. Yes. So, um, so the, you, you cited was able to tell, okay, this was totally inattention or there's no engine, no way in Hell I'm John would take these estrogen blockers on purpose. First of all, it was very small traces, so it wasn't like I was loaded up with estrogen blockers and um, why the fuck would they put estrogen blockers and put them into digital?

Speaker 1:          12:58          We believe that, uh, the factory that created these, uh, these Dick Pills, um, were maybe manufacturing these pills in a dirty laboratory, whatever. And because of this container just tainted. Yes, because each pill that we, that we had tested, some of them had more estrogen blockers, some had almost no estrogen blockers, some head small traces. Actually none of the pills were consistent. So it was obvious that. And we, we tested several different packages. So it was obviously that, that these pills were probably getting made in the same machine and there was just traces, right? Literally, which is enough to show up in your system. When drug do. We found some of these dick pills that had none. No estrogen blockers. They're like, damn, why didn't I get that one? Yeah, exactly. So I, I took one that was just contaminated enough and literally I got tested two days later and it was in my system.

Speaker 1:          13:48          So it was, it was obvious that it was complete accident and even, and even if I would have reported the Deq pill to Usada, they would have read the label and the label would have never said that it was estrogen blocker in there and I still would have had a dirty. Right. Good attachments contaminated. Where does that leave you? How much time did they suspend you for? I got suspended for, for a year back from starting from back in July. So now I fight in July of 2000. I'd love you shot up. I love what they're doing. I don't agree with things like that. I don't agree with things like that. Because what you took does not enhance your performance? No, it does. It's especially in such a trace amount. I feel like in certain circumstances, like there's been several fighters like Chad Mendez. Um, he has a, I believe he has eczema.

Speaker 2:          14:33          He was taking an Eczema cream that had some sort of a, was it a hormone precursor or a hormone? Peptide? I believe some sort of a hormone peptide. I think that enhances the, the use of this

Speaker 1:          14:49          preme. I don't, I don't know the full. I'm

Speaker 2:          14:52          obviously not a doctor or a scientist, but um, there's something about suspending someone for something like that. That seems ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          15:00          Well, in my situation they, they, the, the evening you said his lawyer, he showed, he showed a little bit of remorse. I could, I could feel that he felt bad about what was happening to me because I think he could really, even the arbitrators, they could tell what had actually happened, but their problem was they said John was just negligent. Like you didn't, you should have reported this pill,

Speaker 2:          15:26          but it seems to me that's silly.

Speaker 1:          15:29          But even if I were to report it the pill, they would've read the ingredients and they would've never saw that there was a trace of, of something that wasn't advertised. So why suspend someone for something like, because they, they. Because they said it was zero tolerance policy. It was just like I was the first fighter to ever take them to into arbitration and and they were more upset that I didn't let them know that I took the pill. Then what actually happened was like the rule is you tell us what you take and we can point you in a different direction, but I never told him what I took. My whole argument was if I told you what I took, it still was never on the label. Yeah, so unless you guys were going to spend all the money to take it to a private lab or take it to a laboratory to test this individual pill, you get what I'm saying? I still don't run into the same situation.

Speaker 2:          16:14          I think it's great to protect people from people that are cheating. I don't think it's great to punish someone for taking something that has a trace amount of something that does them absolutely no benefit whatsoever and clearly. And was it supposed to be in that bill and wasn't supposed to be in that pill and clearly wasn't being taken to enhance athletic performance. Right. That seems silly. It seems like a mess. It seems like a mass that. I mean, I, I understand there zero tolerance policy. I don't agree with it. In this war of the Chad Mendez situation, you know, there's, there's weird ones like Yoel Romero. He tested positive for something. They found out that it was a in one of the protein powders or something. He was taken. It wasn't supposed to be in there, wasn't listed that way and they gave him an abbreviated sentence.

Speaker 1:          16:54          You should have. No, no, no part of it whatsoever. But my whole thing is I'm so grateful. I'm still optimistic, man. I'm always looking for light in every situation

Speaker 1:          17:08          and I think that's the way I deal with things. I just am always trying. I always believe there's going to be good. At the end of the day, that's just how I am. I'm just so grateful where most people would be so upset with themselves and all this type of stuff. I'm really not. I'm upset about the fans that are let down who flew out to UFC 200 and things like that, but as far as the whole situation, I'm just glad that that my, my name will no longer be associated with steroids. Right. Rather be vulnerable boy or whatever you want to call me, you know, whatever you want to call me, but steroids that that was really. That was really bothering me, so I'm just glad that it's out. What actually happened.
