I get up and leave even if I don't get the wings. Because if you're going to serve wings or ranch, I don't want to do business with you. Wings must be done with Gucci. Gucci? Yeah. Like the way of they invented in Buffalo, New York and we got to do what would original. You're going to show up with that rest that smells like somebody that she was still same way. Ranch is starting to replace ketchup. Yeah. That's good. If you're fucking hillbilly and you want the taste the ass in your mouth, I'll fucking, I hate that fucking race shit.

I didn't know what I was doing. I was just looking at it and looking at what the fuck was going on. I was just doing little licks at it. I was hoping it would meet me. And then when I caught caught playing hooky with that girl that the sixth grade, cause we used to go to school and then take off in the afternoons. I go one day my mother's home, they fucking call. So me and this girl lived caddy house. Like there was a house behind mine next to her so I could just jump the fence and on the corner of being the house, the windows were open and she's out there yelling and screaming.

You know, and Eddie had this, uh, you know, any like changed his look over the years and became much more focused on his music, became much more rock and roll style. And he had this big bracelet on. It was nowhere leather bracelet. Yeah. And you know, they're stylish people like wearing them whatever. But uh, Joey Diaz is like, what are you waiting for a fucking song, Alana. I remember I laughed so hard. He's fucking that transvestite joke.

Speaker 1:          07:21          One of the greatest jokes anybody's ever sold on stage. He goes, I like transvestites. They Cook, they clean, they couldn't beat on him. Every once in a while the cops come who they're going to believe me at some dude with a wig and a black guy. There's no support groups for these people. Is the cops calm? Who are they going to believe? We sword booed a wig and a black guy that's just, you know, that's this poetry man. To me, that's poetry to checks his email. The guy is that guy in the, what was that movie? Leguizamo. Son of Sam.

You've already done what my favorite Joey Diaz move is, is it turns into a game shout we're, he'll go, you know that movie? Uh, you know the movie. It's like reverse 20 quests that help joeys Stonehenge.

Speaker 1:          08:18          You know what? I kidnapped that guy. I kidnap them. I did that. I got four years. I got all fucking easy. They should have called me in there for 10 fucking years, but people don't really, how much time did you actually do? 18 months. 16 months. Your freedom gets lost, which sucks, but it's the people at home. It's not you or whatever. I can do whatever the fuck it, bro. My jeans are from Cuba. Motherfuckers. Tell me about, I smoked the weed. Castro smoked before he went to the mountains to take over. What's a typical day live in like a doctor who liked it. I became a standup comic. I learned how to do standup killing prisoners on Thursday nights. They used to have movie night. I didn't even know that. They used to have movie that on Thursday night. So the projector would always fuck up like Ustream.

Speaker 1:          08:57          I would always go, what the fuck is wrong with them projecting? No. Everybody would say Cuba. Get up there and talk and I would make fun of the black guys. But what would it be? What would you say? You know, we make fun of the kitchen the first day in prison. It may be a baker, you know, you don't, you don't tell people what you want. It's like Cuba. Like yeah, the outside, I was a mechanic really? Well and here you are, a baker going to say, here's a book, learn how to make bagels. I may be sending them. Rose dog almost blew up the kitchen, right? These mother fuckers are big. So that afternoon they fired me, has a baker and they made me a fucking dishwasher right now, whenever they had shitty meals, the guys I knew when they would go through the line and I would yell, don't do, but there's more drugs on the inside.

Speaker 1:          09:37          There was, it wasn't any oxide. And to boot. This was a minimum security camp. We had contact visits. When you have a contact visit, there's parties every night. But that's the first time I did it. No, I was like, the second time I did it, no one was there and he couldn't do a needle. So the Mexican is took a Mexican thing, a heroin melted it. I had to put like a funnel in mind. Those made out of paper and they drifted in my nose and I got mad like candle wick, Bro, what the fuck is this? They're like, that's heroin man. Be Cool. I was like this for like a day. And then the white dudes, Michael's gimmie speed and they would play basketball all fucking night. I'll be out there of hell's angels and there'd be out there with them. Half of them every week. It was a new adventure. So on Thursday nights they would say, Cuba, fuck the movie. Just go up there and talk about the kitchen. And they were all, all the yarns would yell, don't do it.

Speaker 1:          10:31          I went in there every Thursday I get onstage and then one day a guy in the library, it was like a nerdy dude, the guy that ran the library and I was friends with him. We did acid and the funny thing was that one day he came up to me in the jail and a notebook was a big thing and I was getting ready to get out and I didn't even thought about it. He came up to me and then he goes, hey bro, I got you a notebook. And I go, what's the notebook for your show when you get out? You could write some jokes. He goes, every week you write jokes. I never see the notebook. And I looked at him and I go, I don't even right and this motherfucker went nuts. He goes, you don't right and you go up there every week and do that.

Speaker 1:          11:05          He goes, when you get out here, you, it was like an angel. It was like an angel. I never seen the guy again. I never heard from again. He just goes, what I watch you do? You really need to write and get it together because you have a gift. Just pursue this. It was in the back of my head. The prison really woke the animal. I know so many people look at you. I know so many people that in one point in their life were not good people. There were there were fucked up to run a bad place, but they turned around and became some of my favorite people. You know, you're a perfect example actually. Absolutely can change rules and there's confusion. People, kids don't know what the fuck they want to do. I was lost. I thought that's what I wanted to do and once I did it, I seen the reality of it and never did it again.

Speaker 1:          11:47          And for some people they take the lesson, they run with it, and for some other people they fucking keep doing what they were doing because they don't really want to go anywhere. And I'm really wanting go only way. Even in my darkest moments, I always just wanted a little bit of light so I could shut it. Just to go forward with the, I was looking for 50 hours just to get me started. That's it. To get an apartment, to get a car tall. I wanted I the Webinar fucked fuckers up there watching me that I got a break and whatever, and today I'm not fucking let them in or whatever, but I'm alive. When I wake up in the morning, I'm alive dog. I didn't tell on me alive at 49 he notify you kid. I didn't want to be alive at 49 but now I want to be alive, man.
