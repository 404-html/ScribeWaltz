Speaker 1:          00:00:01       We're here, ladies and gentlemen, the Party's already started with drinking something that my friend Ben O'brian invented. It's called an right brain. It's a whiskey and Alpha brain and it's delicious in a Yeti Tumbler. Cheers. Cheers. My brother. Good to see you, buddy. Yeah, man, it's been a while. You're living the good life and I'm still kicking. You know, it's another good day. I'm still vertical. Yeah, but you live in the good life, man. You're, you're, you're out doing what I want to do. You're out there in the fucking great state of Montana. Did escaped. I landed on Saturday and yeah, I lived in San Diego for I think almost 10 years. Love San Diego. No, no complaints about California. It's beautiful. The beaches, there's mountains. All that stuff. I love it. Landed San Diego, got in the rental car, was going out to skydive and couldn't even see the mountains out by where I'm going.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       A good job because it was all hazy and smoggy and it took me longer to get out of the parking lot than it does to like get back to my house. Go shoot the bow in the back yard, go do a workout. I was still in the San Diego international parking lot so I can't wait to go back. Yeah, there's good and bad. You know, there's good things about the big city life, you know, you get a lot of great restaurants, a lot of cool shit, but you've already done that. You know, we moved to a town that has 22,000 people. Wow. From a subdivision of San Diego that at 260,000 people and I honestly, my only regret is that it took us so long to pull the trigger on doing it. It is unbelievable. And have you done the winter? Yeah. That there yet? Winter's coming.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       So you haven't done it yet? Yeah. Once I visited the winter last year, we were there for the whole month of December. There was a few days it was negative 10. Okay. Which I found a few stand close enough to the fire. It feels just fine. Yeah man. I just wear a nice thick, like a real good jacket, you know, were good, will undergarments. I know it'd be all right. I know some people who work in the industry have to make the cold weather gear just from my old job and they sent me some stuff so it's really not that bad and there's some things in life that I will spend good money on. Cold weather gear, rain gear, just pony up and pay the extra money because it's going to pay off for you in the end. Yeah, it get some real shit. My friend Tony Lives in Columbus, Ohio, and he.

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       The way he put it, he goes like, look. He's like, here's the deal. He goes, you can't really dress for hot weather. He goes, well, you could dress for cold weather. Those you wear warm clothes and cold weather, you're fine. And he goes, but when it's hot out, it's just fucking hot out. You got to go indoors or you can meet up, but then once you get to that level, you're done. Yeah, but even when you knew that hot, but it's like La has no. Whether it gets, it gets hot and that's it. It rarely rains. If it rains 20 days a year, it's crazy. Nobody knows what to do inside. I'm not going to lie. I was, I was laughing and very happy when you were posting about. It was like 100 and 506 and Epa we live is like 60 beautiful bluebird skies, a little bit of a breeze.

Speaker 1:          00:03:02       I bet you get sick, nighttime starve or looking to right. Look at what's The star gazing up there. It's not hard to get out of that light pollution you drive. You know, we were fortunate. We have a, probably the reason we moved up there as we bought an investment property in 2016 and it's in the middle of nowhere, like probably 15 miles out and you want to talk about no light pollution and the ability just to look up and it doesn't look anything unless you've experienced that. You can't describe how much you're missing out if you live in a city looking up. It's unbelievable. Yeah, it's weird, right? It's one of the weirdest things about civilization that we've chosen to do that. I know that a lot of, um, there's, there's a lot of talk about people having like, um, nights or like one time of the year where everybody shut their lights off and they have like a, just a viewing of the stars, like a no light night who's talking about doing a step before online.

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       I've heard people organizing light pollution observance day or some shit. Yeah, I've heard some crazy things online. I try to try to avoid most of the things that I hear about online gatherings that started online. If I know the picture that I put a view with, you're flying squirrel suit flying over the fucking earth. I purposely chose it because you could see the curvature of the earth, the background, or can you based on the comex. It's a bro. Was that shot with the Fisher islands? Whatever the Gopro comes with, that's probably felons. It's got a little bit of a curvature to it. I look at that. There you go. I love that suit. I was jumping that suit on Saturday. It some interesting comments in there. The Internet is a very interesting environment that has no consequences and allows people to interact in a way they never would if they were sitting across like we are right now.

Speaker 1:          00:04:47       Yeah, and it also requires discipline in that regard. Like the way that people communicate with people. It just, there's no discipline in terms of like conserve, like just think about what you're going to say. Think about if a person was in front of you, think about how it's gonna affect that person and then proceed. Nobody does that. There's none of that. There's not, I wouldn't say nobody does that, but it's few and far between. No consequences. Especially if you're an anonymous person. She just a regular Joe Blow and you got an egg and it's like, Dick, fuck, six, nine, five, two, whatever your name is and you just feel like talking shit. I mean I understand it. If you. If you put a quarter inch piece of glass in between me and another driver on the road, I've been known to say some interesting things that I wouldn't say to somebody in a line at starbucks if they bumped into me.

Speaker 1:          00:05:35       Do you know what that's from though, what they say? Um, they, the scientists have studied the human response to critical situations where you're, you have to make split second maneuvers, like high stress situations and you don't think of a car as being a high stress situation, but when you're going 70 miles an hour and every little thing, it's like you're, you're way more tuned in than you think you are. So anything that happens like this motherfucker like you, you're way more ramped up. That's where road rage comes from. It comes from the fact that your brain is very aware that you're going to have to make split second decisions. So even though you don't realize it, you're at seven all the time. He just ready to flip to 11 when a guy's crazy. You motherfucker. Yeah, I mean I've seen people just lose their shit.

Speaker 1:          00:06:23       And by the way, here's the really crazy thing. I've seen people lose their shit and if, if it advert physically escalated, like they did pull over, they got out of the car. I've seen that be helpless, be helpless. They don't know how I've been with people. I'm like, listen man, you don't know how to fight it all. What are you doing? You're starting a fight. That's crazy. Don't do that. You're starting a fight and you're praying to God or whatever you believe in that this person doesn't actually follow you or pull over. Yeah, they're in a car version of the egg on twitter. They just assume like, fuck you, you're never gonna. See me again and this isn't real piece of shit, but sometimes it is real. You know? I've seen people duking it out on the side of the road and then it's pretty ugly.

Speaker 1:          00:07:03       It doesn't go well for both parties. Generally. A buddy of mine from Jujitsu pulled over to the side of the road with a guy once and they start doing it now and they both knew how to fight and it was crazy. They were hitting doubles and sprawling and the guy goes for a Doris, he reverses them. He gets side control knees and in the body. That guy fucking hits them at triangle. They fucking, he passes the guard like the whole thing. Go back and forth on that meeting, on the fucking grass. They were on the grass on the side of the road and then when it's, they're both exhausted. They high fived each other and then got back in their car. They were laughing like, you know how to fight man. Like it both actually they both rug, I'm going to fuck this dude up.

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       I'm going to fuck this dude up. And then they both were not just, not just did they both know how to fight. They were both at like a purple belt level, little impromptu grappling session. Car and punches and kicks and the whole deal. But they have both actually knew how to fight. It was pretty funny the way he was telling it was pretty hilarious. I mean, I mean I can't, I can't lie. I get, I get excited when I see people upset in their cars. Like if they get cut off accidentally and I see them getting pissed. Like the footage is slowly rolls off the gas. They get really close and I'm doing 40 on the freeway and I don't know. I mean I don't know. My problem is probably just an asshole, but as the more upset they get, the more warmth I feel in my soul as I'm going down the road, watching them lose their shit in their car.

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       Well, don't you think that a guy like you who's been through so much actual real combat probably relishes a little elevation of the normal day to day life? Just a little turn that bitch up a little bit. Let's just crank it up a little bit. I'm probably the last person that would ever fight like I just. And I bet you it's the same with the UFC guys, right? Who make their living in that insane octagon like you think. Some of the things I do are a little bit atypical. I think people who live in the octagon are absolutely out of their mind, but I bet you

Speaker 2:          00:08:55       you flew 18 miles and a squirrel suit. The suit did most of the work, man, I just laid in that bed. It doesn't matter the fucking all this shit that can go wrong. What did you say what the temperature was when he jumped out? 50 below zero. 50 below. With the wind chill and I was rocking a tee shirt, not smart. How cold did that get? I couldn't feel my hands. I had hand warmers. The chemical know the ones that you crack open just for like skiing, but I didn't. I didn't open the bag until 20,000 feet, you know, didn't really think that through. It needs oxygen, open the bag while you're flying, like up on the way up. It was an hour flight to altitude and I knew it was going to be cold so I opened up the things and I put them on my hands and put my gloves on and send them like why am I not feeling these heat up?

Speaker 2:          00:09:42       And then I realized that they need oxygen for the chemical reaction. So I jumped out and I buy probably halfway down. I couldn't feel my hand so I just had them like tucked up behind the wing and I know where the little small parachute is that you have to pull to deploy your parachute. And I'm like, all right, be all right. I know where this is. I've done this before. Pulled the parachute and I get on the ground and then my hands started burning because the chemical started reacting, so it went from freezing cold hand to feeling like I had my hands dipped into law so I couldn't get the gloves off. Also, probably a little

Speaker 3:          00:10:13       hypothermia, right. Approximately. Say they found a guy recently. I'm in, I want to say Oregon or Idaho, I don't know, one of them cold places. And uh, he went elk hunting and they couldn't find him. He got lost and when they found him he was dead and he was only like a couple hundred yards from his truck and they think he got snowed out and couldn't see where he was going. And he had taken his jacket off and he'd taken his gloves and his hat off and they say that's one of the signs of hypothermia is you started people in naked. A lot of the time they take all the while your fork, it just start. You know, you hit hot too. Apparently. It's not just euphoria the, I don't know if you get hot or Washington state. Yeah. Missing elk hunter recovered in Washington. I'd heard about another guy who died in Oregon who was a.

Speaker 3:          00:11:01       He was a tech guy. He used to be on this tech show that I used to watch and he would review like gadgets. This was like early two thousands and he went up with his family and they didn't have a car that can handle like serious snow and they got stuck and they were there for nine days with no food and he went walking off to get help and froze to death in his family was eventually rescued. How far did you make it? I don't think he made it very far. I mean he wasn't wearing the right clothes. You're wearing regular clothes, you know, and he just, he was just desperate and he was trying to save his family and it's just so sad because I had seen that guy on TV. It was so weird because you see a guy on tv, we're reviewing gadgets, like here's the latest laptop, like look at the, here's the ether net port and what we've got here is a, you know, the blah blah blah, blah blah and

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       all this different stuff. He review like the most technical of technical things and in terms of like the highest level of electronic achievements so far, right? Like the newest gadgets that people love, like, like the, when you think about society and civilization, you think about those things and meanwhile the guy froze to death in the forest. Like the real life. All the tech in the world isn't going to save you because you get out into the wild. If you rely on something that has batteries for your sustainment of your life, you're going to be in trouble at some point. Yeah. You gotta have baseline skills. Yeah. They say that like when people go into the forest, people are afraid of grizzly bears and all sorts of different things. But hypothermia kills more people than anything. Yeah. It doesn't surprise me. It's slow too. I mean, that's the insidious onset of, you know, your feet get a little bit cold.

Speaker 1:          00:12:44       And from what I've, uh, I've talked to some guys who work like up in Alaska, right? Where's Mckinley Mckinley's in Alaska, wherever McKinley is. And it's not uncommon for them to find people basically missing, but they're naked because it's that slow that thought process degrades. I'm sweating or take my jacket off and they just lay down and go to sleep. Like it's just that one percent of the time until you are basically a popsicle and doesn't your brain pump morphine or some equivalent to morphine through your body when you're near death. I think when you're in severe pain or near death, every literally make something. I think you just go into shock, you know? Yeah. I don't know the, the physical process of what happens when you go into shock. But I've seen some people that are in a lot of pain and they would have liked to have their brain pumping some morphine one happening.

Speaker 1:          00:13:35       Maybe they weren't pumping enough. Perhaps. You know, I'd read something about that, that there were, there was someone who was trying to explain I'm near death experiences and like why when people have near death experiences, they have all these freaky visions and some of it they think could be connected to psychedelic chemicals that your brain produces, which are that day. Definitely know that's true, but I think there was also some talk about some morphine like substance that your brain makes. I wouldn't surprise me if your body recognizes it was on the downhill slide. That'll be the little. This dude doesn't need these. Keep screaming. Yeah, probably. It probably just a protection mechanism if anything. Yeah. Well, when you're out there, man, I think one of the cool things about being in the wilderness is that most people, most people just never experienced that for long stretches and when you do get to experience it, it gives you sort of a like, oh, I always thought the world was this.

Speaker 1:          00:14:30       I always thought the world was Phoenix, Arizona, where they drive down the street and you go to see your friend and you're in the car and you go to the movies and there's the restaurant and then you go to Montana, go wandering through the forest and you see deer and bears and you see the mountains and the quiet and your cell phone doesn't work and you're like, oh yeah, this is the actual world. I have found that it's that in that people and including myself, think that I am this, and then you go out into that environment where you're detached and then you have to rely upon yourself and your knowledge and your grid or your fortitude and you kind of figure out more of who you are as well too. I don't think people really. You don't figure out who you are if you live in the greater Los Angeles area.

Speaker 1:          00:15:14       Do you know who you are in Los Angeles? Correct. But I don't think he wore in Los Angeles is who you really are? I don't think so either. I think you'd get to go out and outside of that and either rely on yourself or maybe even more importantly, rely on somebody else and have that dynamic outside of you mean you couldn't, I guess you could starve to death obviously, or you know, not have enough water, but the places to get those things in La, you could solve in a block in either direction, go far enough out in the woods and you're on your own. And to me that's where you find out who you are. I do. I like being out there because I get to think about me a lot. Yeah. I think that's a real good point that you're not who you think you are, who you are.

Speaker 1:          00:15:53       You think you know yourself, but you know yourself in the environments that you know. Correct. The way you really find out who you are is to experience a lot of different environments and a lot of different difficult things. Like you don't really know someone until you see them tired to see them exhausted. Hungry. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, the John Dudley is always said that about hunting, like you think you know a guy take him hunting. His litmus test is hunting camp. Yeah, I believe he says you'll either be friends for life or I'm never going to want to spend another moment with you. Yeah, it was pretty accurate. It come off the rails. People. I don't want to get up at five in the morning. I just went to bed at 11. All right, well you're not on the invite list for next year. You're missing out on this thing we're doing here.

Speaker 1:          00:16:36       You can go hunt that pb andj and the refrigerator. There's a line where you got to learn though, like there is a line. We're like, okay, we could die today. This is not. We should. We should really be careful if we go out today, you know this is. This is not the like my friend Adam Green Tree. Do you know Adam? You got to meet him. First off, I don't know him, but I definitely follow him. Yeah, that motherfucker skirts the line. That's his water buffalo up there, by the way, right above the old glory as Paul. Awesome. Is that your elk from? Yeah, because that one is. That's from to hone ranch. God, look at that rack on that thing. Um, but Adam, he, he crosses that line. He gets to the edge that pushes that line is how I would describe it. He goes out by himself a month at a time. Nothing but a tent runs out of water all the time. Drinks funky water coming out. He's got that weird Australia gut though. We could just drink water and like, because some microbes going on or whatever he's eating in this life. It's like it's festering inside of his body, kills off everything else. He doesn't get sick at the fucking guy drinks at it creaks all the time. He's probably always just sick and that's his normal. Maybe is sick. It's happy though. Yeah. But he, uh, he

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       gets close, like he gets close to that edge like that. Do you ever see that when you watch the intro instagram story, when the grizzly bear kept charging him and he's fucking filming it all for Instagram? Yeah, but he's also got an unloaded gun. I was very upset with. No, it was loaded, but he had never shot it. So was out of battery. The bullets were the wrong size for the gun so he could. Well, you can barely see the top of the gun. I'm looking at it and you can see the barrel at the angle. So the slide is back in like your, your. You can tell your. Oh yeah, like you're pointing your finger at a bad a bear. You're going to pull on that as it each your face. He said the bear ran to 10 yards. No thank you. Clip 10 yards.

Speaker 3:          00:18:28       Past false charge. Ten yards. He said when you see it running and you see the muscles rippling under the hair and the hair and the snow and the masters of that claw ripping through the ground. No thank you. And it's huge. You know, he said it was like a nine foot bear. She's running around and if so if he. I mean obviously he's got a ton of interactions with animals in the wild, but if he had run instead of standing his ground, he had been fucked. It would have attacked him, right? 100 percent. Oh my God. He would have been fucked. You can't because they just have an instinct. It would just take you out. It's like you're weak. You're. You're moving away. Not only you, not a threat. Now, now the bear has the opportunity to close the distance and the bears don't exactly know what the fuck you are.

Speaker 3:          00:19:17       They don't exactly know what the fuck a person. If they might've seen a person a few times before, but they don't eat a person and they don't fuck a person. The problem is when a bear does eat, a person wants a bear, eats a person like, oh, I could just fucking eat people delicious. They can't run it like a bear chases on elk. Like it's. It's kind of a hustle. There's a lot of running. I can't imagine a baird catching an elk. They do this really crazy video, but they're eating a moose. He's chasing this moose and it's a big fucking. Barron's chased him around a circle in there. It looks like they're filling it from a helicopter and the bear is just this. This Mousse is hauling ass. See if you can find that Jamie bear. The fucked up thing is when bears catch you. They just eat you. They don't kill you first just start. They just start eating just like they do a salmon or they grab a salmon and just bite into it and pull it apart. They do that to your guts. See, that's where I'm really hoping that morphine thing from your brain is true.

Speaker 3:          00:20:15       Can you imagine looking up and seeing your lower torso inside of the mouth of a massive imagining it? That's what's so scary. Do you ever see the movie grizzly man? No. How dare you? How dare you miss out on the intentional comedy in the history of the watch it tonight. It's fucking great. You want to talk? We were talking about this before the show, but people who are gay who don't want to admit they're gay run. That's this guy, and he decided to go live with the grizzly bears to protect them in the forest. He got to eat. I, I know this story. Yeah. Okay. Now, but it's a werner herzog film and I don't know if Werner Herzog was trying to make it funny, but. And I mean maybe it's just funny. It's funny, but it's funny to me because I have this crazy appreciation for wildlife and respect for it and there's part of me that like, like Steve Rinell had a funny way of talking about this guy.

Speaker 3:          00:21:10       He goes, hey, you say all you want about that guy. He goes, that guy was a hard camper. He goes, that guy did some hard fucking camp and he was out there for six months at a time. My guy got to give respect. You really did live with the bears for six months at a time, but we're Herzog. The way he filmed it, he filmed like the way he would have people talking about the guy, like they go to a sheriff and the sheriff's like, I thought he was retarded. Just really digging into that character and plot development. Yeah, the guy, I mean it's just he shows you this guy's ex girlfriend who's crazy and they're talking about his life and they interviewed one of his past roommates or some guy who knew him in La and he's talking about how crazy he is and how he kind of made up a path for himself and it was just like this really had fake accents that he would use sometimes.

Speaker 3:          00:21:59       Just a really bizarre character who found his identity in taking care air quotes, taking care of these bears that didn't need taken care of and he was going to protect these barriers and these barriers. Just they didn't give a fuck about him. We had don't think they wanted his protection. Oh, it was amazing. It's amazing. But anyway, the film of him getting eaten, he was filming. Bears had the cover on the camera, but the audio ran and the audio ran for seven minutes. By the way, if you try to find that audio online, it's not there, but there's some fake audio online that people attribute to it, but if you listen to it with a discerning year, you tell those people aren't really screaming, fake screaming, but it was seven minutes long of the bear eating. Him and his girlfriend, his girlfriend hit the bare, his girlfriend to the bear.

Speaker 3:          00:22:47       The bear was eating him and the girlfriend hit the bear in the head with a frying pan. Didn't do Jack Shit. The bear tears her apart. You know, I'm not going to lie. I'm more surprised that he had a girlfriend who wasn't really a girlfriend. It was a girl. There was a friend who thought she was referring to worlds. Two words. Yeah. I've had friends that are gay, that have wives and these poor wives. They walk around looking like this all day long like feels like, what the fuck's wrong? How can this guy doesn't fuck me? Like man, there's a lot of poor bastards out there that are just deep in the closet and they don't. That's not cool. That's when we hit that point now where you can just kind of do and be a wish. We were. I wish we were. I know a couple guys that are deep, deep in the.

Speaker 3:          00:23:29       Let me say. I like, oh, I talked to them. I talked to them in brief brief chunks because I'm, I, I get this feeling from them where I'm talking to them where they just want to end the conversation before I go, hey man, are you gay? Like every conversation is like this really quick, really quick, really quick. Hey, good to see. All right. Hey, take it easy man. See you next time. Hold on. Hey, before you go. Are you good? Are you guys. It's just, it's a bomber man. It's a bummer. Yeah. I mean to get to get to 2017 and not have that worked out. It seems to me to be a travesty that the fact that people give a shit. Yeah. Why does anybody care what other choices that they make in their life? Well, my theory has been there's two types of people that care about gay marriage in that is people who are really dumb, or people that are secretly worried that digs are delicious.

Speaker 3:          00:24:25       I can get behind that campaign. That's my theory. That was one of my old bits and I think that when you know, there's a lot of it, there are people are afraid that other people gonna think they're gay. A lot of it is people who grew up where they hear terrible things about gay people or prejudice people around them tell them crazy things about gay people. They don't realize that gay people were just people that like guys, that's it. And there's other guys that like guys too. And if everything was open, they wouldn't feel so creepy. They feel creepy because they have to hide it and be secretive and always be like, it's forbidden or there. Yeah. So that's where the weirdness comes from. But if you go to Santa Monica Boulevard, there's these fucking. There's this area of like three blocks in West Hollywood and Santa Monica Boulevard that I don't get out of my car.

Speaker 3:          00:25:12       It's not worth it because you're just loading the scenario up. I'm already thinking in my head like, I'm never going here. Do you ever go to willow's wild animal parks where we stay in the car and the monkeys jumped on your car and rip your fucking windshield wipers off? No. Have those New Jersey went? Yeah. Yeah. The monkeys jumped on your car. I don't know if it happens anymore, but they used to. We used to be there and you know, you'd have to like agree that the monkey might fuck your car, can sign a waiver when you get in, like don't go there with a Ferrari until connect with a car that could get jacked because these monkeys, my Jack your car, but you would be around these animals and you'd stay in your vehicle the entire time. They have one in China and it's a great story.

Speaker 3:          00:25:51       Uh, about a year ago this lady was in an argument with her boyfriend. She's like, fuck you. And she got out of the car and she went around the car and she was yelling at him in a fucking tiger came. You posted that video. I saw that and just yanked her away. And then the tiger. Then someone else chased after and apparently she lived, but her mom died. Her mom was going out trying to save her saber from the tiger and the tiger killed her mom. Stumped bitch just thought she was. She's like, I have it in my head. I'm going to fucking say what I want and I'm going to get out of this car. Fuck you. And she gets out of her car and she does it in a wild animal park filled with 800 pound tigers. If you do stupid things, you're going to win stupid prizes.

Speaker 3:          00:26:35       It's amazing how quick the tiger seizes the opportunity though from that video. She was only on the driver's side of the car for a few seconds so them lights out. Pull that out, pull that up. It's a great video to watch. One of my favorite videos, it's just like I don't want anybody to get killed by a tire. I really don't, but I do want, if someone gets killed by a tiger doing something really fucking stupid, I do want everybody to watch that and go, hey, don't do that. This ain't the lion king motherfucker. This shit's real like it. Here it is. Oh God. She gets out of the car, the Wildlife Zoo. She gets out. Watch passenger side. Back seat. Fuck you. Just imagine the argument going on in front of you. I'm Outta here. Yeah. She's like, I'm so tired of your bullshit. She runs around the other side.

Speaker 3:          00:27:16       Going to make one more point, and the guy's like, hey, will you just fucking relaxed? Bitch. Just don't hit me. Don't hit me. God Damn it. Get back in your car. Pat. Jason just drags her lead. He runs out of the car. Oh God. And then the mom ones out and that lady's dead. The third lady Dayton is a rangers come out. They're going to try to save her. See, I think the move is close. All doors roll up. Windows think grabs are so quick. It's like, this is what I've wanted. I'm so tired of eating a whole meat served on an aluminum tray. Fuck you. Fuck you for keeping me here.

Speaker 3:          00:27:54       Here's the thing, man. I think if they fed those tigers wild animals, they probably wouldn't do that. They probably wouldn't give a shit about that lady, but what they do is they give the Tigers no animal reward to have an animal reward system right there. The tigers jobs to clean up the population of this one. This tiger flying through the fucking cool. Are you kidding me? Rip. This guy's hand apart. Just flew up to the top of and he listened some fingers. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's what I'm talking to his hand apart. That tigers don't play, but if you let that tiger killed things like if they let a bunch of axis deer Lewis, which that demands, that would be what they look for. They would chase down the deer, eat them. They live like natural, but so they have this overwhelming desire. It's like, here's a way to put it. If you. Yeah. If like if you were a guy, that's not a good way to put it. I was going to say, if you're a guy and they extracted all the come from your balls, but they kept you horny, but that wouldn't make sense.

Speaker 3:          00:28:57       Absolutely no sense. I bailed on it. Right? What else? I was like, that's a bad analogy. Do don't run with that one, but these animals, they get their appetite satisfied but not their appetite to kill their deal. They're born like you roll a yarn, roll a ball of yarn in front of a kitten. Fucking cat dives on it because that's what they're supposed to do. This supposed to attack things. They have a bill. Even little flirt, fluffy little kittens. They have a built in desire to attack things. I think that's why people are the way they are and social media. They don't have the release that the human body, soul, Spirit, however you want to describe it, is designed to get somewhere else and if all you get it from as a device through other people's pictures are selected posts, I think you go crazy. I think that

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       is why I don't trust nearly every human being on the face of the planet. It's just they're not, I don't think they get the chance to express who they want to be.

Speaker 3:          00:29:49       I agree. One hundred percent. I agree 100 percent. And I think um, I've been thinking a lot about this whole boss, employee sexual assault, sexual harassment thing that's been going on every day. Something else comes on and it's always the same thing. It's always a man in power in a woman who works for him and something goes down and it's never the opposite. It's never chicks getting their pussy by some dude who works in the office. It's never. There's a lot of women that are ceos or it hasn't been reported yet. Those guys can keep their mouth shut. Right? Or the guy doesn't consider that to be harassment. It's not. She's, yeah, she lets you fuck her and she buys your car. Damn, we got a mustang the fuck you go to the New York Post for.

Speaker 3:          00:30:35       Oh my God, that almost came out of my nose. But if it's a. But I think this is what I think. I think that a lot of males right in a male in a position of power, like the chief of the village, like that guy would probably have his choice. He was the war Lord. He had this choice of women and the women would respond to him in a favorable way, which would let him know. It would indicate to him that it's time to fuck right, this girl wants it, I'm going to give it to her. So when a guy is like some Harvey Weinstein guy or someone who's at the front of some giant company and everyone in the office kisses his ass when he's there and everyone's so happy to talk to him and people are angling for, for raises and they're angling for promotions and they're always nice to him and they treated him like royalty. I think the guy start thinking that these girls are attracted to him, that they. That he's going to fuck them. Like it's a power thing, but it's also like a trick on the reward system that the brain has and then it's a scumbag thing to. There's like a lot of factors in there. I think, I think it's a lot tied to the power side.

Speaker 2:          00:31:43       I cannot think of an example of any occupation that doesn't have that problem somewhere near the apex,

Speaker 3:          00:31:50       right? When a man gets in power, just power. I think power. I think that as

Speaker 2:          00:31:57       humans we're only capable of dealing with so much fill in the blank when it comes to that, whether it's the money or the fame or people throwing themselves at you. I think at some point, depending on the moral compass that you have and how it's calibrated, it ends up swinging in the wrong direction because you can look at physicians, you could look at religion, you can look at people in the military, generals in the number of sexual assault cases and the generals like a one to four star generals in the US in 2017 was insanely high to comedy. Bill Cosby to, you know, just fill in the blank. You can find an example everywhere. Once you start getting to the apex, I think there's just a disconnect on how much, depending on who you are going into that position, I think there's a disconnect on how much you can handle

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       because we was a really weird one because I. I've had this theory for a while, but I think that during cosby's era, the 19 sixties, I think it was not just common to drug women, but it was almost like a joke like that. People thought it was funny because drugs were fairly fairly new and the consequences of sexual assault warrant talked about and it wasn't thought about the same way and I think that those during that day, like he used to joke around about it in his act. I remember you saying that before. Yeah. He had these Spanish Florida. Yeah, and he even had a section, a segment or a scene on the cosby show where someone would give something to someone that would make them have sex with them or he would put them to sleep with something. Like he would joke around about it and he had joked around about it on talk shows and stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:33:36       I mean, this is, but I think that when you talked to someone who was around during the 19 sixties, they used to call it slip and so under Mickey. You have heard the term before? Yeah, I think they just once and shit started coming out and they start giving them to people just slip it in tow so fucked up. So fucked up. But it still happens, man. To this day it's still happens. You know? I had these girls on the podcast the other day. I'm, I'm Korean and Christina from the podcast guys we fucked and one of them was saying that she was hanging out with this guy and she had a drink and then all of a sudden she just couldn't fucking controllers got into a cab or something like that. Right. And rescued her. You had your hands full with those two. That was like crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:34:17       It seemed to me like you had to wet cats in a paper bag when she was talking about I had an anal anal orgasms with a vibrator. I'm like, well, okay. Yes, yes. Tell me more. No, I was listening to that at my house. I think folding laundry in my head, I'm like, damn, you got your hands full with those two. Well, they're fun. It was an entertaining podcast for sure. They are girls that talk publicly the way girls talk privately when they have a couple drinks in them. One hundred percent. Yeah, and that's what's so attractive about their podcast. I wish I had there. I don't know what the term to use. Bravery or whatever it is to be that open and honest and like just fuck it. Here I am. Blank slate. Here's what I like. Here's what I don't like. Here's what I might like.

Speaker 3:          00:35:01       I don't know. Well it's appealing though. When someone does do it. Like if someone you can tell you like, okay, this person is actually there. They're being completely balls out honest with no repercussions or horses. So like say if they were an actress, like let's find some famous who is a famous current actress. Good. Give me like a hot. Who's a hot Jennifer Lawrence. Yeah, but she's already had that scandal. She had that scandal where people got a hold of her pictures and you know, was without her permission and shit like that. Yeah. I'm out of my legal and this one, Scarlett Johansson. Okay. Let's say Scarlett Johansson and Scarlett Johansson. If somebody like filmed her talking about how she had had an anal orgasms with a vibrator and how she likes having her boyfriend get his dick sucked in front of her. That was it. She didn't know that people are going to like, it would be horrific.

Speaker 3:          00:35:51       She like, oh my God. She'd have to stay home for days. You have to pop advils and sleep on the couch with a fucking blanket overhead. You know what I mean? She'd be horrified. I can't believe that got out. This is so awful. Or she could go on and be like, yeah, you're goddamn right. Yeah. But these girls just like blurted out and then move onto the next thing. I like Tacos just one thing after the other, but they're, that's their free, you know? And that's what people like. This is what people liked about Charlie Sheen until they found out he had aids. Yeah. That was an interesting development in that particular store. It's like, oh, well this story takes a fucking terrible term. Yeah. Now I gotta change the lenses out on the glasses that I view you through. Yeah. I thought you were winning.

Speaker 3:          00:36:34       Yeah. I thought you had tiger blood just fricking winning at every turn. I didn't realize. Didn't realize you had the high five and the old tiger blood. Yeah. The, the high five that he got. Um, apparently is what started that whole thing off. What is insanity? Yeah, sure it is. Yeah. Well, when he, it turns out that when he was diagnosed with HIV was right when he started going wild and talking about, you know, snorting and smoking, eight grams of crack and that's how I roll and all that shit. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And I'm sure when you start off bat shit crazy, it doesn't help and that's your baseline, but you remember how people reacted to that though. They will like, yes, tell us what you're doing, Charlie. I mean, he did a Goddamn tour of theaters and he didn't have, he didn't even sit down.

Speaker 3:          00:37:19       He would sit down and just be like, all right, so just got done smoking an eight ball. Well he would tell stories, but they had to craft what the thing would be. See what started out was he was just going to go in this theater tour and he's probably on copd if I talk to the people, they're gonna love us and he didn't know really what to do. So the first couple of shows were a total disaster and then he started bringing comics in there with them. So like my friend Russell Peters did a bunch of them with him. So he would go up for a little bit then go up or like what kind of host the thing. Oh, so it was comic and then trolley and they were sitting down talking and this way you get to hear Charlie's wild stories and talking crazy shit.

Speaker 3:          00:37:57       But the comic would frame it all with some actual comedy and comedy and comedic relaxed reaction to this maniac. So they keep it on the rails and Russell's great comic and he's particularly great at talking like talking shit and ad libbing. Like Russell's a great. He does a lot of crowd work and his act, so he's like super fast and speedy and Russell brand's. Russell Peters, Russell brand, who is another guy he's an absolute hands full with on the podcast. Yeah, he's. He's a character. Don't get that guy coffee. Yeah, he had a lot of coffee. Well, he's a. he's a drug free character. Choke Free Soda of.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       Yeah. Now, now drug free. That guy did enough drugs to kill all three of us in this room probably. He lived. Yeah. God bless him. Now he's got a story to tell. Yeah, but he's another guy. He's pretty free, you know, even like with who he is now, he's free and he's all. I cannot believe the transparency. Like I said, I don't have, I don't have the, the courage to just be like, boom, here it is. Let's just unzip the fly, lay it out and here we are. People like, you just don't try. I bet you did. I try. I try my luck. So for the podcast, my rule is I just try to be honest. That's all I try to do is just be honest and portray myself as I am and say the things that I actually believe and not try to add one percent to it, but there's still some people were, if they were to ask me some questions, I'd be like, yeah, that's for another day.

Speaker 1:          00:39:21       You know, I'm not going to answer every single question. Well also, especially if it comes to like military shit, there's stuff you can answer, we'll then you just make stuff up. Oh, is that what you do? Pretty much is. There's a lot of that going on, right? There's a ton of that going on, which is why most of the time I try to dispel misconceptions. The reality is no, there's really nothing that I've ever done that you can't talk about. Is there any books or anything that's ever come out where you knew one story and then you saw come on and you're like, I have gone to the bookstore and read books written by an individual who said they were on a combat operation that I was on and don't remember seeing them there. It's problematic. Yeah. That seems like a real issue. It's a huge issue.

Speaker 1:          00:40:08       Um, I would say 99 point nine percent of books that have a trident on them should be purchased and then put next to your toilet paper roll. So when you run out of toilet paper, you can just start ripping pages out of the books, wipe your ass with pride and just showing that symbol is the symbol that is associated with being a seal. It's, you know, you get, when you get that symbol, they change your designator inside of the navy system and it registers as a 53 slash 26, which is why do you think you see them using that trident? Because it's recognizable. So they're doing it because they're bullshit artists. They're doing it. Um, I can't say exactly why they're doing it. I know some people are doing it purely to make money. Some people got out or a little bit early and have used the recognizability of that mark to further their own motives down the road and a purely 100 percent profit seeking other people are there trying to tell I guess would be their story or their version of a story and that would be the people in the middle and then I guess on the other end, the best example I point people at as generally Jockos book, it's not a book about hey, no shit.

Speaker 1:          00:41:14       There I was, which is the number one indicator of a store at this completely false as la. There we were like, no, you're done. Why is that be? People want to romanticize and embellish the reality of, of what actually happened and I don't know if it's the desire to make it seem like it's

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       more than it was. I don't know if it's because most of the time when you're coming from a military background, you don't. You're not. You're not used to any level with people really. I would call it fan ship I guess or you know what I mean? Like it's you. It's the military and being in the military is not about money, you know, I could, you can pull up online and see exactly how much every individual in the military is making based off what rank they are and how many years they've been in. So people will be approached and like, look, this is how much money you could make if you wrote a book and they're like, holy shit, that's the. And so they will and they'll make millions of dollars. The problem is is if you start embellishing those stories, in my mind at least it starts tarnishing the reality of what the occupation actually is and the in the good and sometimes amazing things that happen lose a lot of their value in my mind and I just think it's an enticement that guys are not used to inside of the military.

Speaker 2:          00:42:25       It's very. When I was in the military, I mean I feel like I was talking to Jamie before we started. I feel like I'm late to everything and late to social media. I'm late to. I had never listened to a podcast before. I sat down and met you with tate. Really? I had never listened to one. I had no idea. I had no idea that diversity of information that is out there and you can go and, and I mean you can almost get like a, a, an advanced degree in whatever it is you want to get by just going. I had no idea. Never listened to one because I was so focused on something else. And then you lift your head up from that world and you're like, what the fuck is going on around here? And you know, if you post the right pictures on social media that you and your outfit with your thousand yard stare off into the distance, then you get more followers and then people, oh, come and speak and say.

Speaker 2:          00:43:12       And it just, it's an enticing thing to individuals in my opinion, that are just not used to that. And it can really. It can really. I think it can take you down a path that I would recommend most people don't take, which is why I like the way Jocko, when as he has experiences, but he's trying to take those experiences in, portray them in a way that people can make use of them. It's not about the story, it's about what he learned during the story and how you can implement that in your life. So there's a broad spectrum of everything from literally rip off pages and wipe your ass to recommend to anybody that I encounter that asked about [inaudible]. New Book is fantastic and it's so short. It's like it's an easy read. That's what makes it so fantastic book could change your life because if those. Those quotes are from a real inspirational guy, he's. He's really trying to really be. I would say he's not trying to be inspirational. He's. He wrote down in committed to paper the principles that he uses to live his life, his passion and his enthusiasm for getting up at 4:30 in the morning and working out unprecedented for like a week. I was getting up a few minutes before him and I would just post on twitter like up before Jocko, Hashtag don't be lazy, and then I got fucking tired and I had to stop.

Speaker 2:          00:44:26       Don't do that. He'll get up earlier. He will, but he, of course he was liking him. I was like, God damn it. I'm trying to elicit

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       a response out of you. Jocko. It's falling. He led. Absolutely. I mean because if people were asked you, they will still ask me are I think I'll still ask them if we know each other and I've known him forever and they don't. You can't. You can't call how Jocko like that. I'm like, I think it's okay. I think it's gonna be all right. If I make funky Jocko on twitter, it's going to be all right. He's got a good sense of humor. Yeah. Well especially if you know the guy. Yeah. He's not going to get pissed about it, but his father was like, this is a funny man just because you have at for 29. Hey Man, if you want to be a lazy bitch ahead and then I have to stop myself, that's as far as I can go on twitter because I will lose my mind and I don't want to be that person.

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       Yeah, you can't respond to many people. You have like a minimum or a maximum requirement per day. Just give yourself like a threshold. I've looked at three different comments about. I don't understand how you could possibly keep track or even tabs. I mean your numbers are astronomical. No, I don't keep track. Occasionally I dip my toe into the water of social media, but for the most part I don't. It's got to be like an abstract painting rolling by. They're like 60 miles an hour. You can probably just catch one or two things that comes by. We'll also, between working out, writing comedy, doing stand up, be with my family, archery. Anything else I'm doing at the time? I don't have the fucking time. Podcasts. Yeah, UFC duties. Whatever I have to do with doc. I don't have the dime. It doesn't exist. So you're tapped out?

Speaker 1:          00:45:56       Yeah, so I do what I can. I post stuff and then I get out of there and plus I don't the turmoil, the P, I don't want to like, you can engage. Like, what's that? That if you, uh, what's that? If you respond to every barking dog and ever get where you're going, if you ever heard that. Sounds good. I'm with you. I think I paraphrased it, but that's the idea behind this. Like there's no way you don't have the time. And I have friends that have less followers who will go like my friend Owen Benjamin. He's fucking crazy. He'll, he'll have twitter fights all day long. And I told him the other day, I'm like, Bro, it's gonna. Stop engaging. We got to stop doing this. It entice people. Once they recognize that you engage, it would entice them to hit you up more. Exactly. And then your time is you're done.

Speaker 1:          00:46:38       Yeah. And then they'll try to piss you off and then you'd go back and forth with them, oh, well fuck you. And then next thing you know, you're up at 3:00 in the morning checking your twitter exhausted the rest of the day. Just compliment people when they say mean things just right back. I think you're an amazing human being. Heart emoticon sent. Thanks. Thanks Sweetie. Because they don't know how to take that. Oh, how long do you think you're going to last? The winter to the end up keeping the place in San Diego and just coming back here in November? No, I have really not thought about San Diego since the day that we left and I am with tickets. Snowed in will be like a good five feet cold weather stuff and I got guys truck. I do have a truck. I have a F150. Nice. Slightly modified though.

Speaker 1:          00:47:23       Jacked. Jacked up. A little lift. It's came tested. Thirty five big 750 horsepower. Mud and snow tires. Probably 750 horsepower. Jesus Christ. What the fuck do you have in the hood? Shelby supercharger. Oh, you went. You went deep. It came that way. My wife was so pissed at me because I went in with my other f-150 to get an oil change and I technically did get an oil change because I came home with this truck and she walked outside and she was just like God. But a lot of those like super sport performance trucks, they, they have street tires on them. Mine have massive knobby tires. I literally went in, uh, I got very fortunate and I got a great deal on a Ford on like a pseudo endorsement sponsorship thing earlier. So I had a bunch of equity in my truck. I literally went in to get an oil change and right next to me in this spot was this Ford f150 black ops model, like the Tuscan Tuscany so hard.

Speaker 1:          00:48:26       And I get out of my truck, which I usually feel good and then I'm looking up at this other truck and now I immediately feel like bitch. And I'm just an eye. So I climbed up on the wheel and I'm just reading the sticker because I couldn't read it from the ground. I'm just looking at like, all right, well that price is totally outside of my range and I go inside and of course the salesman happened to see me and he comes over to the service side of the, you know what I'm getting now given the guy my keys, and he was like, what do you think about that truck? Like, I think that thing's awesome man. He's like, well, let's just. Let's just run the numbers. Like okay. Four hours later I'm going home and the new truck for hours, it took you four hours in the dealership.

Speaker 1:          00:49:01       You wives call it up, where the fuck are you? Well, she does that because that's not the first time it's happened. Oh, you've done that? I buy. I tried to buy her a car one time. I told her I was taking her minivan in Honda Odyssey. Best urban assault vehicle ever dual open doors. You can just take down a compound and that thing. Yeah, as long as you have blacked out windows, they don't store some rocket launchers on top of that bitch and just roll. So I was like, hey, how do you want me to take you in and take your car and get an oil change? I was getting her a Tahoe and like three hours and she starts calling me, what are you doing? I'm like, oh, they found a leak in your flux capacitor. It's going to be a few more minutes. Shit shit about cars, but the future.

Speaker 1:          00:49:35       Yeah. And uh, so I come home and she's like, oh, I like that car. It's the wrong color and the different seats. And I'm like, God damn it. So she went back and picked out her own. So after a couple hours, the dealership, I think she realized something was up and I got in trouble for that. Yeah. I saw a video where they were comparing that shelby supercharged f-150 to the raptor. They were trying to figure out which one was better. I don't know, but I think that truck is ready to go for the winter time. It's got some big old tires, uh, an entirely too much torque and power for me. Yeah, it's a little bit loose, you know, break loose, locking differentials and all that jazz. We don't even know what that means. I'm locking differentials means you can like you have an arb locking differential and what you do is you set it so that all wheels will always spin together no matter what. So it locks together, so if you're, if you're in a place where one wheel is spinning, it doesn't

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       work that way. All wheel spin together and it's not good for driving down the road, but it's good for getting you out of places and for traversing very difficult terrain. It might have that. I might have fucked that up, but locking differentials are a. it's a must on any sort of off road vehicle. I never planned to tick it off road even though I think it's designed for the Zombie apocalypse. I tried to baby that thing and just park it in the garage. Yeah, but what if you have to like what if you have to go into the forest to get your elk. If you're packing out, it's called somebody else who's a trail, some sort of logging trail. Call somebody else, bring their truck. I don't think you can use it in Montana. No, I was actually thinking about that to wind. Now. I don't even know what I'd use it for, but I feel like to have it, I feel like I would be more prepared for life in general with the window.

Speaker 3:          00:51:19       My Bronco has a wrench, doesn't suck and that thing's bad ass. Never going to use that. When they were telling me how the winch, where's my Yay. I'm fucking thinking. The confidence that you have gay climbing into. You're like, I got a winch, a winch. Nothing can stop me. What the folks got stomped me. Nothing to winch. Yeah. You can pull something out of a ditch. That's like a man thing. Like men want equipment. They're never going to use liquid. Should always have a chainsaw. Just in case 100 percent. You live in a fucking apartment in New York City. Why do you have a chainsaw? Never know. Might have to cut down the door. Shit goes wrong. Straight goes sideways. Now trees start growing everywhere, but we're ready for winter, man. If we got the ski pass is ready to go, I can see worldclass skiing from my son's bedroom mountain.

Speaker 3:          00:52:02       We live just south of white fish. So in white fish the mountain is called big mountain. It's not big sky. Most people confuse the two big skies in Bozeman. I think you said you had been to big sky before. I've been to Bozeman. Bozeman has big sky makes guys like right outside of Bose, just south of incorrect and white fish is just north of where we live in Kalispell. And a big mountain is, it should be open in four days. We went to Bozeman and we were there when they have this, uh, this grizzly sanctuary. We took a ride to yellowstone and we stopped the grizzly sanctuary. And the other bucket bears, they're so big they don't even look like they're real and they throw them frozen watermelons and that's what they're eating. A whole frozen watermelon. So they throw this frozen because it was hot out and we went in the summer and the bear just this giant block of ice, you know, that's what it is. It's a, it's a huge beach ball of ice that's like a 20 pounder. The bear just opens his mouth and crushes it with one bite, just cuts through the frozen watermelon like it's nothing. It's so sobering when you watch a bear lying on the water, right. He was in the water, like lying on its back holding this frozen watermelon in his paws and just chomping on it and eating it. It's not a Disney movie. Don't mean when Disney movie bitch by. My brother in law who has never hunted before,

Speaker 2:          00:53:27       has purchased a read works one nice already has the yard. He's got the whole eight. He's already got a silverback sitting in his house. He's already got an elevate rest in his bill. Comes in and like two weeks and he was trying to explain. I was uh, had dinner with them last night and he's trying to explain to his son and his daughter like, it's not Bambi that I'm going to go hunting with. And they're just like, no damage. No Daddy, you can't get. But it's, it's funny. [inaudible] my kids were like, why would you kill a bear dad? Or why would you kill a deer? Why would you kill an elk? Well, to eat it 100 percent. Yeah. It's. It's interesting though, help people in my limited super limited experience into the hunting world. Very entrenched in in it's either no. These animals like these is, this is Bambi, how could you do that? Or they have an understanding of what's going on. I'm like, oh, okay.

Speaker 3:          00:54:18       I have a friend who's a hardcore Vegan and these kind of an asshole about it, but he's got dogs and he feeds him dog food and dog food from the dog food store and it's got animals chopped up, ground up, stuffed into these bags and he's good with that and I'm like, you're a hypocrite. Like you're a fucking hypocrite. You really are. He's like, well, the dogs are carnivores. We're not. No, you choose to not be a carnivore. You choose to be an herbivore. Okay. But most humans are omnivores. That was going to say that we evolved. We evolved to eat a wide variety of foods and this, this thing that you're doing is just, you're standing out and he's an asshole. He's a nice guy, but he's an asshole and he's always been like a really negative guy, like he's nice to me, but he's.

Speaker 3:          00:54:58       He's nice to his friends, but he's always had this propensity for negativity, pessimistic attitude towards people be successful as a human being, but shitty to people like for whatever weird reason just has this aggressive attitude and now he uses it against, against people that are involved in hunting and he gets off on it. He thinks it's fun. You know, it's just, it's a weird thing that you can sort of justify the torturing and killing of these animals to feed your dogs, but when someone wants to go out and hunt an animal to eat it, like I get all the people that are pissed off that people go out and hunt lions and don't eat 'em and hunt elephants and don't eat them. I'm drafts and stuff and I'm with you 100 percent, but here's the thing that's not eating deer. That's not hunting buffalo, a bison and eating bison.

Speaker 3:          00:55:49       That's not counting and eating things that we're talking about. Two totally different things and then when you get to like the lions and the elephants and there's a real problem and the real problem is that there's not enough money in conservation to ensure the safety of these animals unless these animals are valuable and the most valuable way that you can present these animals. This is fucked up, but when they're hunting targets, and I'm not. I'm not saying this is the only way to do it and I think it's not, but Africa is a crazy in the best documentary about it is Louis Theroux who's a British documentary and did this trip where he went to one of those high fence hunting camps in Africa. You know those things. I've never been to Africa. I was in a. It was in Kenya, but I've never been around. And you weren't hunting people where I was actually.

Speaker 3:          00:56:42       They're building schools. Oh, let me give you. I'm a humanitarian at. You're a sweetheart. I am a sweetie, but luther rose documentary. Louis through his documentary is amazing because you kind of get the sense of what it's all about. Like these animals. A lot of them were going extinct just a couple of decades ago because there's massive poverty all throughout Africa and there's no money and they figured out that if you take these animals, protect them, put them inside a fenced area in, in talking about these enormous, like 10,000 Acre reserves preserves and then people fly in to hunt them on a daily basis. They get a tremendous amount of money, so then these animals that populations are booming, there are higher than they've ever been and the animals are protected. They're no longer in any danger of being extinct, but a lot of people are super uncomfortable with the circumstances and I get that too.

Speaker 3:          00:57:33       I'm in the same boat as you would like to me. I don't like hunting a giraffe. Not not into it personally. Not going to make a character judgment against somebody who is or the the elephant or whatever animal that you may go to call it trophy hunting. Like I don't know enough about it. I would assume and hope that the situation is exactly like you described where the people who live in the area are managing and monitoring. The species and making sure it's good to go and if they're doing that, I have no issue with it and in the same breath I totally understand why it's very off putting to individual who see a picture of that and just loses their shit. Yeah, I completely get the elephant thing and particular elephants to me or this kind of majestic sweet animal, but the reality of people living in Africa is different.

Speaker 3:          00:58:18       People that live in Africa, elephants destroy their crops, trample them. It really becomes a big issue of elephants move into areas where they're farming and they have to do something about it and sometimes they'll. They'll have to hire hunters or have someone come in and do it and then once someone does shoot one of those elephants, the amount of people that come in. Have you ever seen what happened? She posted a picture or you posted a picture of. I think it was an elephant and it was a line of people outside of the border of the picture. I'm assuming they were waiting to come and get their share of the bank or whatever it was from that animal. Yeah, I mean these are people that have a really hard time getting meat. An elephant meet is gross as it sounds to people listening to this.

Speaker 3:          00:58:57       It's supposed to be unbelievably delicious if you were raised on it. I mean it's supposed to taste really good. I'm not saying you go out and get an elephant burger folks, but I'm just saying please don't. The soul thing is it's very complicated and you could say, well, these people shouldn't be raising crops where the elephants live. The problem is this is not like any other thing, like it's not like an encroachment issue. Like these people are living in a fucking village in Africa. I mean this is like literally where humans evolved. So this is, this is a real situation of humans and a very small tribal situation encountering elephants that just decide that, hey, I'm an elephant. I'm fucking 10,000 pounds. I'm just going to eat your food, bitch. You Ain't gonna do shit and these people don't know what to do about it.

Speaker 3:          00:59:43       There's a lot of that and there's, that's the other thing. People say, well, elephants are going extinct. So yes and no. In some places in the world you go to Iowa, there's no elephants, right? Content as well. They're extended no elephants. Yep. But there's parts of Africa that have a lot of elephants and they actually have to control the populations and it's the same thing with deer. Like people in California will tell you, you know, hey, you know, you shouldn't shoot a deer. He talked to people in Iowa and you're like, please, you've got to shoot these deer. My wife Rector fucking car. She's in the hospital. Same thing in Montana. There's deer on the side of the road, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere. And you can see for on the bumper, bumper is in windshield smashed. It's doesn't take a rocket surgeon to put two and two to get an advanced degree.

Speaker 3:          01:00:29       I love how people in Montana have those fucking road warrior grills. So I got one. You got bring it. Come on dear. Apparently if you hit a deer in Montana, you can call the fish and game. Let them know what happened. Throw it in the trunk. Yeah, I like that. That's good because then you get to keep the meat. The meat doesn't just go to waste. I like that. As long as you're not driving around looking for a deer, that's what someone said, but the problem with that is the odds of you hitting a deer on purpose or like fucking zero. I know, but if you try to avoid them, it's a pretty high percentage. I'd almost hit a few like I don't want to hit a deer in this truck. Oh my God. Yeah. I remember I was coming home once. I had a Gig in upstate New York and I was driving down to where I lived in new Rochelle and I hit this one patch that had so many deer.

Speaker 3:          01:01:15       I had to drive like 20 miles an hour on the highway. It was fucking insane. It probably wouldn't even get out of the way. They were just darting in front of the road, like left and right, left and right, and I'm talking like an infestation. It was crazy. And this is what happens when there's no predators and no hunters and you know you don't want wolves in your backyard. People once you live in Montana, kind of cool. I would still take a strong pass on wolves in the backyard. No, I would like to see them. When I was up there, this lady who lived up there was talking to us and she said, um, she lives in this canyon and they had wolves come through a couple of nights before. And I said, what is that like? She goes, well, it's two things. She's like, it's beautiful and you also have to be cautious. She's, Oh, so it's this thing where you like, I'll really love it. They're there and I loved looking at them, but I want them to go away. I love looking at them from the safety and security of inside of my house. She's like, well, people get a little nervous about their livestock and definitely their pets. I go their pets. She's like, yes, that's number one. They will kill dogs

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       real quick. I bet. It sounds amazing though, to hear a pack of wolves in the wild. I have no, no experience with that. It's got to be. I had never heard an elk bugle until September. Oh. And I also thought that they, after I heard them bugling, I assumed that they did that all year round. I just thought, okay, I'll communicate by bugling. I had no idea that for basically a month you can hear them communicating like that and then they zip it and start working together as a little probably not heard. I had no idea. And it was in a valley had when I was in the middle of my, other than optimal hunting experience and just surrounded by it, we couldn't have had this conversation at this volume.

Speaker 3:          01:03:00       Yeah, like you got to be shitting me. There's a film that's coming out Friday, me and Cam went to Utah and we're a hunting elk in Utah and there's one scene in it where we just every now and then if you go elk hunting, and especially this one place in Utah is enormous ranch. It's a private ranch and it's 240,000 acres. Where were you in relationship to Salt Lake City? Couple hours drive. I wasn't paying attention. Jed was driving, you don't know southeast West. My phone. So it was a new. I got to, you get off twitter joke. I had to do email. I was behind. So, um, uh, anyway, there's this one part of the film while we're in there and you literally, you might hear 100 bugles around us. There's screaming left. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:03:50       Yeah. And you know, the audio, even if you were in like an Imax theater would not do a justice. No, I couldn't. I couldn't believe it. I, the one thing I know, I don't have enough of his interactions around animals to understand behavior and patterns and what to expect, but I mean in that day was a reinforcement that I was sitting at my jaw was on the floor. I could not believe what it sounded like. It's like a,

Speaker 3:          01:04:15       like a mystical animal with the sound it makes. It's almost like a lord of the rings character and when you watch them do it to just like, we watched this one elk fuck this cow. And it's crazy the way they do it, the way they do it as like a brock lesnar double leg take down. Like he, he got on top of her from behind and then boom, he hits her one time, just shoves her forward and she collapses on her front legs and he kinda wobbles off of her, but he is, he's a one pump chump. Maybe that's what they're into, what they're into one bank, get it done, move on to the next. And he's doing it all day long and protecting month? Yeah, draining himself. They lose like 30 slash 40 pounds. Oh, do they really? Probably more. Well, I'm saying 30, 40 pounds, but they're, you know, seven, 800 pound animal. I bet they lose a lot more than that. They get real skinny. They stop eating. They just fuck like crazy for two months.

Speaker 2:          01:05:11       Unbelievable animal, but probably the most majestic animal that I've ever been around. I cannot wait until next September. Yeah. There's a

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       real controversy in Montana about wolves because the wolves that are in Montana right now have been reintroduced from Canada. They captured them from Canada and then reintroduced them to the yellowstone area and there's a really interesting video about it called the wolves changed the walls. Changing rivers. I think it's called, it's like a short film, a short film. I think it's called how wolves changed the river and it all just talks about how the introduction of the wolves changed the way the river flowed. Because is this how wolves change rivers? Yeah. It's pretty bad ass because it. It shows the need for predators. It shows that you can't just have this overabundance of wildlife, like a undulates cows and elk and things because they eat all the grass when they eat all the grass. The trees never grow a strong root system. So there's a lot of things happen.

Speaker 3:          01:06:15       Like ECO system on its head. Yeah, and some birds don't survive and you know, there's like, songbirds have been spotted in like really high numbers in yellowstone now. There's a bunch of stuff. They documented it. A lot of it is because the wolves chase down the elk and made the elk and it decimated the elk population, like knocked it down to like half. But in the process made those elk like just a little bit more wary, a little smarter. Still a healthy population, but that's Kinda how it's supposed to be. It's not supposed to be like these hunters that lived there. They got super spoiled because they were used to like seeing hundreds of hours of bed, like slide open the door and get the laser range finder out. Well, especially if you're a rifle hunter, which a lot of them are. There's way more rifle hunter. I can't get behind that. I get behind me. I mean

Speaker 2:          01:07:11       no, I can't need meat. It's the way you did it. I get it. I'm saying me, myself personally, it has no draw or interest whatsoever. Yeah. Bow Hunting on the other hand, now we're now we're talking. What's the difference to you? One I absolutely suck at and the other one, uh, generally can hit what I'm aiming at and it's easier with the rifle. Like wind is the perfect example. You take a shot with a rifle in high wind. The wind when you're thinking of rifle is from the ballistic effect of the round, you know, left or right or in the temperature and all that stuff. When with a bow, your crawl on your belly. And being a Ninja and then it's like animals gone. I got a completely different ball game. You could sit with a rifle with a cooler and a bowl of Chili and get an elk.

Speaker 3:          01:07:59       Well, you know the other thing that gets me with rifles and I don't think you should make it any more difficult. That's not my point. I think the most effective and efficient and ethical way you should kill an animal should be the way you do it. But there's these pods that people have these that they set

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       up a tripod with a bench. It's essentially God like a mobile rifle bench sitting there on. So it's got a you lena, like a lead sled attached. You can just bring your finger in from the outside and just bring it back and it doesn't move at all. You don't even have to have it in your shoulder. You lock it in place, you screw it down so you have the perfect angle. You set it on the vitals and you squeeze it off and boom, and exactly where you want it. In that setup, you could actually not even have it shoulder. You could go sit in a chair to the side of it and people do it all the time. To be clear, I support hunting whether you want to, however you want to do it. I'm a full fan. For me personally, I just can't get into rifle hunting gets too easy.

Speaker 1:          01:08:56       If you put an elk anywhere from zero to 1500 yards in front of me, it's game over Sun. Right? Well, you're an expert marksman though. I mean, I would say I'm a marksman. I don't know if I would add expert to it, but I can sometimes hit things humble. I missed. Sometimes I guess I'm good Miss Story, but when you see an animal and you're hunting with a bow, so the thing is the difficulty and the challenge and the connection to the animals way more intense because you're trying to get inside a 40 yards. The whole thing to me is it's not a matter of how much I feel like I can do, right? It's a matter of how few things I can mess up and I love fighting against the odds like that. I love the challenge of having to worry about not only cover and concealment and you know, high ground versus low ground, but shadows and light and moving and noise inside of that moving and monitoring the wind and then the fact that the animal might just want to go take a piss and you're screwed.

Speaker 1:          01:09:54       You get the best stock in the woods. I got, I gotta take a Wiz. I love, I love the challenge of it and I suck at it. So I, I just, it is a draw to me that and my wife has already shaking her head at me. She's like, God damn it. You're going hunting again. Yeah. So I think for, for some people they're. The issue that they have is that they think that killing an animal should not be this pleasurable challenge that it should be. If you are going to eat animals, you should be shooting him in the head with a high powered rifle where you can't miss and they die instantaneously and there's no suffering. If only that situation actually existed. Well it can. If you shoot them from five yards, well you know you missed some big targets with a rifle from pretty damn close.

Speaker 1:          01:10:38       How close? Seven feet. Hey Man. When you're running it through a hallway and stuff, sometimes that's a different animal. It's a different animal both figuratively and literally. I missed, you know, if there is no 100 percent solution, that's true. I get it right. But if an animal doesn't know you're there and you're setting up and it's 100 yard shot and you have a 30 year, you've done 300 win mag or you don't even need to get to 100 yards. Real estate, you can be at 300 or $500. Whatever. You feel comfortable shooting at a. If you want meat though. Yeah, it's the way to go. But also why not

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       enjoy the experience? I don't think there's anything wrong with. To me it's a challenge in more than a challenge in of whatever it sounds gay, but it's a journey. I, I enjoy Sanga. I Dunno. Just journeys. Okay. It depends. I guess on the type of journey. How do you feel about the Lord of the rings was a journey. It was a journey. I've watched all those movies about the books. I didn't read the books. I want to go to New Zealand and jump off the cliffs in that movie. Uh, but the, the journey is like why not enjoy it? I enjoy, I enjoy the struggle. I enjoy that. It's hard to hit what you're aiming at with a bow and exponentially more so that every time you add a yard to the distance, I enjoy that the animals are, they have instincts that are amazing and that you cannot defeat their nose and that you can't control the and joy all of that.

Speaker 2:          01:12:03       That to me is I think, and I'm enjoying that experience. And then again, this is my first bow hunting season. I started bowhunting and late August, so I have almost no experience under my belt, but I do enjoy the, the final aspect of that as well too, in getting into position and being able to perform in that moment. I don't think there's anything wrong with enjoying killing an animal that you're doing so respectfully and like my freezer right now, my house, my goal is to never go to the grocery store and buy meat again for the entire year and I think our freezer is full enough to do that. My kids love it. I've made. I got maple elk sausage, I got Italian elk sausage. I got brought worst. I get steaks. I got roast like we're not going to the grocery store. Yeah. That to me like so why not enjoy that whole process, that whole story arc doing it ethically and enjoying the journey along.

Speaker 2:          01:12:52       No, I, I agree with you, but I just wanted to hear you spell it out because that's the issue that a lot of people that are sort of in the animal rights activist side of things, one of the things that they would have an issue with is the enjoyment part of it, but I can't help it if some people are pussies. It's just the challenge of like doing things that are hard is enjoyable and and succeeding at things that are difficult to do. It was also enjoyable. Yeah. Why can't you be happy about winning? Why can't you be happy about accepting a challenge willingly and nobody's forcing you into it and when you're successful, you're not only happy with that success, but you're happy with every step along the way. I don't see any problem with that. Well, because they're Bernie Sanders supporters. I'm not qualified to talk on that topic.

Speaker 2:          01:13:39       People are fucking with you right up until that point. I fucking love Bernie relaxed. Joking around here folks. Yeah. Yeah. I love it, man. Even if you're not a hunter, I mean, if someone doesn't want a Holland, I think to take prolong trips to the wilderness, I think it's fucking great for you. I think I started doing it in 2012 and has changed my life. I whole heartedly agree. I was dead serious when I say I don't think he figured out who you are until you get into those environments. I have taken a sounding on the depth of who I am as a human being in the worst, most

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       physically arduous moments of my life and I, and I wish that more people would willingly go to that point. I think that it would, it changes my perspective for sure. It changes my appreciation for things. Nothing will make you appreciate the little things in your life more than nearly dying and having, you know, and like, oh wow. Like I have all of these things that I wasn't paying attention to and people don't know that. People who didn't listen to your earlier podcasts don't know your story. So tell, tell people what happened when he almost died on the jumping side of the house. Let's go to the military first and then we'll go to the jumping side. Yeah, I mean, I don't know if it seems like to me like you might be supplementing your need for danger with this jumping thing. Talk about how you described me as a psychopath.

Speaker 1:          01:14:56       Every time you have this fucking Grazie nude, you, you're crazy person that I know. Then I texted you that once and you responded that crazier than, you know, I said I think on the. Yeah. What? Yeah, because like, well for one you willingly used to enter into fights and you have said before that you would have gone into the octagon and earlier age. To me that's insane. It just, for whatever reason, like going in there and did willingly go in and just getting into a fistfight with somebody. How much martial arts experience do you have? Exactly. Zero. Yeah, that's martial arts a lot. Like bowhunting. How many of you got into base jumping experience? Do you have fucking zero. You're making my point zero on the ledger. Look at that fucking picture. That suit got. Damn. It looks weird. Fish islands, Joe Thailand's. What I've been able to determine from my jumping is that yes, people, the world is round.

Speaker 1:          01:15:51       You sought from the sky. You could tell me. Sure when I jumped from pretty high. Here's something you little curve. Here's something that someone pointed out that's a really good point on, uh, reiterate it. I retweeted it. You could look at the moon with the telescope. I was going to go to the same place because I read that. Yeah, clearly. Right folks. Okay. Try to look and find Mount Everest with a telescope and then explain why you can't. You can't because it's on the other side of the fucking planet. You dummies crazy people. It's so sad to me. It is. People love mysteries though. They love things that are hidden, hidden, hidden information. Anyway, that's why the seal books right there. You answered why people will buy because of that symbol they look at. They're like, oh, I want to know the secret. Of course it's.

Speaker 1:          01:16:41       Yeah, and there is no secret. That's what I. that's the point I can get. I want to get to that definitely, but what? How did almost martial art thing, but the martial art thing I think is a lot like the bow hunting thing and that it's very, very difficult and once you start doing it you get better at it and then you get addicted to it and it's not crazy. People like I'm not even talking about like actual competing and fighting, but just training because when you're training you're competing. Like when you go onto the mat, you train, you're trying to improve yourself, but you're also

Speaker 3:          01:17:09       trying to tap someone who's trying to tap you and you go, you're both going at it and when you do it and you get better at it and you get better at it, you develop this kind of understanding of what it is and it becomes this like very addictive thing. Like guys are addicted hard to Jujitsu. Well, is it possible to master or is it a never ending evolution? Well, you'll be a master in comparison to someone who doesn't know what the fuck they're doing, but yeah, we'll definitely. Physically, the only problem is your body starts to break down as you get into your older ages. Like most guys that I know that are in their forties and for sure in their fifties, like I was in Hawaii recently with Ed O'neil, who's a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu. A lot of people don't know big Ed O'neill from married with children and a modern family.

Speaker 3:          01:17:57       That guy, he's a beast. Seriously? Yes. Legit black belt in Jujitsu. Under the gracies. Yeah. Would have never guessed that. We'd never done so many fucks with them and getting thrown in their head and choked unconscious. But he was telling me this. He was there. He is right there at o'neill black belt training with Horian Gracie. That what's the average journey to a black belt years was I'd say 10. Ten is average and that's grinding like getting after. Not Thursday. Every other week. Yeah. But some, some people get there quicker than 10. You know, Bj Penn got his three. I was a brown belt for eight years. Eight years of brown belt. I like your stone job. I was fuming. I can train together. Let's train him like twice a week and you know, trying to have a career, but you know, for, for the people that really get into it, they really get obsessed with it.

Speaker 3:          01:18:50       It becomes just as addictive as archery, hunting. Anything else? It's. I and I think what we were talking about earlier when we were talking about people being angry and like on social media because they're not getting those natural rewards and the natural struggle of life and their life is very muted in that regard. No struggle or no struggle. I think that's one of the reasons why Jujitsu is so appealing to people and even though you get injured in Jujitsu, but most of the injuries like a tweak my back or I fucked up my elbow or my knee gets screwed up. It's not like brain injuries. The brain injuries were the ones that were the most disturbing to me because I was. I was recognizing at like 21 that I was having some issues. You were talking about this recently about this, the headaches laying in bed.

Speaker 3:          01:19:32       I have and I know a lot of guys from previous career who are suffering from we're discovering or the military is doing research into the causes of the brain injury issue. It's not. It's not awesome to read your future when you get diagnosed with that and like, okay, so what does it look like when I'm 60? What does it look like when I'm 78, late? That's not good at all. Those aren't good Tarot cards to read. My good friend Dr. Mark Gordon, who is an expert in traumatic brain injury and does a lot of work with soldiers and uh, Andrew Morris Foundation, he

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       has a warrior Angel Foundation and Dr Gordon does a lot of work with him and they, they have developed some really good protocols for helping guys and these helped a shit ton of guys and he does a lot of the work for like nothing. Just trying to help as many people as he can because you know, he's, he's, he's doing well financially, you know, he doesn't, he's not desperate for money to eat. He does a lot of charity works. My point. He's dedicated a significant amount of his professional time to try to find solutions for soldiers. And also he's done a lot of work with football players and boxers and fighters. Anybody who's going to get that enclosed brain trauma it at the end of the day, I think on the chart it ends up looking the same. It doesn't matter how he necessarily got it. The UFC is in involved in some new protocols now too.

Speaker 1:          01:20:57       They. They've developed some stuff in San Diego. In fact, I forget what the. A medical institution that's doing it, but they've got something. They're dealing with some sort of electro magnetic therapy, magnetic resonation with touch. I have heard there is a. It may well be the same clinic. There's a couple of buddies that I have who came to San Diego, La Jolla area. They would go in once a day or twice a day for a quick session. I'm pretty sure it was magnets placed either across from each other, whatever. It was a protocol. I think it was for a month and to a person. They all actually said that they had a significant benefit, whether that be. Most of them were saying they were sleeping better and I don't know the causality or correlation there, but they had improvement. It could have been their mood function, whatever it may be, but so how did the fighters, what do they think about if you get knocked out in the UFC, like you're just flatlined, do you have a minimum amount of time before you can back?

Speaker 1:          01:21:55       I think most of the time they give them a 90 day suspension, which in my opinion is way too short. I was going to. Yeah, because first of all they say like 90 days, no contact, but those guys are going to be sparring before then. That is the issue that I've heard with some of the active duty guys now. They'll go in and from a perspective that they kind of want to preempt and get an idea of where their head is at currently. They'll go in and they'll get a scan or however they. They couldn't give me the scans because I have retained metal in my body, but I think a lot of it is based off of Mris and the magnets and stuff and they'll recognize that they have the precursors or they'll. They'll have damage to their head and the guys, they don't want to take any time off.

Speaker 1:          01:22:38       They went, just want to get back into it. It's, it's, it's a struggle. They're like, hey, listen, this is could be what it could look like for you in the coming years. And the guy's like, yeah, I get it, but put me back in coach. It's a struggle to get them to take time off, which that doesn't surprise me that the UFC guys were the same way. No, that's, that's absolutely the way they are. Especially the real savages. The ones where the winners like Michael Bisping, you know, he lost the George St Pierre and then three weeks later fought against Calvin gasoline and got stopped and a lot of people criticize

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       that, me included, and they shouldn't let them in there. You know what I mean? He needs time to recover. You got battered in that fight, got choked unconscious. Then you've got them fighting again three weeks later. It's just not smart, but he

Speaker 2:          01:23:16       probably a not knowing a thing about it. Fought tooth and nail to get into that ring with you. I guess 102 weeks later it's a fucking animal until you're, until you're done 60 and then you're drooling on yourself and you know, you're thinking or the Easter bunny. I mean, that's not, that's not a good look.

Speaker 3:          01:23:32       No. And it's possible. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. You have to almost protect people from themselves or may be. There could be an argument that there should be sort of a comprehensive education for fighters at least because this is an elective thing, right? And which you're definitely going to get hit for soldiers. My good argument as well, but there should be some sort of elective or uh, you know, um, some sort of an education thing.

Speaker 2:          01:24:03       That's the word I was going to say. At least at least educate to the, just go in, go into whatever situation you're going to go into, whether it's the UFC or the nfl or the military, whatever it just go in with an educated perspective instead of going in blank and, and at the end of it not understanding where you're at and why it happened.

Speaker 3:          01:24:22       So what do you think it is that makes you want to jump out of planes? Perfectly. Good. Airplane. You put a squirrel suit on a. do you think this is what I asked you before? Do you think that this is like your fulfilling some sort of a desire for excitement? Some. Some need for extreme situations? Well, so skydiving, jumping out of an airplane, is it to me, if you,

Speaker 2:          01:24:52       if you follow some very basic principles of being current and maintaining your gear and taking your time to pack your parachute the most difficult or not most difficult. The most dangerous portion of a day skydiving will be your drive to the drop zone and your drive home from, uh, what happens to those people that fuck up and die? Well, there's two. So you get a separate two categories. There's jumping out of an airplane with a parachute and a reserve parachute and a lot of altitude and a lot of time. And then there's base jumping which is off of a static object with one parachute generally closer to the ground. And that lack of altitude and separation from the ground gives you less time, less options. You got to be really tight on your, a game in both of those worlds. What I think in my opinion is that kills the most people is complacency.

Speaker 2:          01:25:36       There has not been a gear related fatality is far back as I can really find it, at least in the last 10 to 15 years. It's people killing themselves, not the gear killing them. How's that work? What do you mean? How did they kill themselves? Uh, getting in over your head, attempting a maneuver that you have no ability to recover from if it were to go wrong, uh, in the skydiving world. So to use the, the wingsuit as an example, if you keep the suit flying straight, it feels incredibly stable. It feels like you're laying in an air mattress. It's not hard at all that you literally get out of the aircraft and you spread your arms and legs out. There's Ram air inlets that inflate the suit and you can lay on it. You can literally just relax and lay in the suit and you'd fly at 60 percent of your performance to make up a number that's probably somewhat accurate, but then you know, maybe you want a flat on your back, you know Jesus.

Speaker 2:          01:26:27       Then maybe you want to fly next to people. Then maybe you want to do an intricate formation that's both vertically and horizontally separated. I've heard of people colliding while Sky Dot yes. Has catastrophic results. Like Louise get ripped off a. yeah. There was a pair of Golden Knights that guide to capitate and it didn't decapitate the guy from the pelvis down. Cut off both legs, but you can get yourself going 100 miles an hour forward speed. So you got off both. Yup. What hit his head? Hit his shoulder head is a, I believe the lower portion of his legs. And what happened to the guys shoulder? He had a vacation in the hospital for a little bit and the other guy died. Yeah. Actually knew what I think. I might be wrong on that. I think the dude with no legs, I think the dude with no legs is the one who lived because he jumped again.

Speaker 2:          01:27:14       The guy who hit him is the one that died. Fuck, it's a. it's jumped again after that. Yeah, nearly. Yeah, of course. Of course he did. It's like when you text me like, would you do this shit and France into the planet? I'm like, don't ask me rhetorical questions. I'm gonna. Ask you a guy was trying to get into the plane. He was doing the squirrel suit into the plane, but he missed. Yeah. Sometimes you miss. He bounced off the plane and it didn't look good, so that was a the same red bull dudes and that is probably the worst situation you could get into because you could see he was spinning in the suit and that is how you can kill yourself in a wing suit if you try some crazy maneuver that you're not capable of doing, essentially stole the suit and then you end up on your back spinning out of control.

Speaker 2:          01:27:56       You'll black out in, you know, whatever happens happens. What happened to that guy that bounced off the plane? He pulled it out. He did. He did. Because you know later on that day. Yeah. I mean, but those. So that guy that is fred invents their red bull dudes, they are at the absolute apex of what's possible and yeah, I mean he hit it. He was able to recover because later in that video they were both able to successfully get in, but that guy has been jumping for decades in tens of thousands of jumps. So of course he can recover from that. If you've got 10 jumps, you're dead. But the problem is people see that video and they're like, I know what I'm doing on Thursday, and he died. They do stupid shit and they're not. They're not aware of their ability or their skill or they're just not looking in the mirror and being honest with themselves.

Speaker 2:          01:28:44       They attempt something crazy, but most common in skydiving thing is somebody to die under perfectly functioning equipment. They'll have a really small main canopy, like most main canopy. The canopy or suspended under in your harness when you're learning is about 300 to 360 feet. It's like driving a school bus. It really slow turns. It doesn't dive, and a lot of people try to get to these little postage stamp parachutes. There are 71 square feet, 69 square feet, and in those canopies, if you initiate a turn, regardless of what you do after that turn, you cannot pull the canopy out of the dive until it goes through its natural recovery arc, so if you initiate that turn 300 feet low, you're done. You'd be. You'd be lucky to walk away with a set of powdered femurs, which is exciting to watch from the ground. It's a very interesting noise to hear happen.

Speaker 2:          01:29:38       That's best case scenario. Middle of the ground would be wheelchair with a colostomy bag for the rest of your life. Worst case scenario, you're getting carted off in an ambulance and you're dead and it's just a rush to get to that super small canopy or you just started jumping, so this is like a status thing. Guys want to show you that they're jumping on the super small up. You ever see people in the mixed martial arts world who just started and they think they're ready for the cage? Yes. It's the exact same thing. I bet you would happens in Motorcross as surfing guy learns to serve as like north shore. Let's go like. Excuse me, sir. You're using a foam surfboard that's 12 feet long to go to the north shore. You're going to die, but nothing you say to them easier to use a foam on this 12 feet long.

Speaker 2:          01:30:18       I don't know. I don't know where it came from that from probably on a smaller way. Maybe I should get a foam surfboard, but I think I think either way though on the north shore they're going to die, but to you try to tell that to that person. They don't want to hear it. They're ready and not only that, they're ready. I need to go to best buy and get about four Gopros and then we're going to send this thing and you're dead and it presents this and it creates this. That's what I like. Uh, I don't like to talk about the risk necessarily because there are, there is, in my opinion, a community of people that really romanticize that risk and they define themselves by that risk or that's not for me. That's not what I'm looking for at all. But when it comes to skydiving, it's just fun, man.

Speaker 2:          01:30:56       I cannot not smile when I'm flying that wingsuit. You're doing 120 miles an hour forward face first. They've got a bug in the mug. Oh yeah. You'll come down to speckled all sorts. I've almost hit a bird base jumping in Switzerland, like it's just, Oh yeah, it's. But again, there's a difference between skydiving and base jumping. Skydiving is if you have enough experience and you learned that you can handle with most likely what's going to come up, you can just focus on having fun. Base jumping is a different activity for sure. It looks the same. It's a different sport, different act. I don't even call it a sport. It's an activity. How many guys have you seen die base jumping, skydiving in a squirrel suit? Actually, not that many. I have seen more people die under the super small canopies turning to low and just impacting the ground.

Speaker 2:          01:31:45       I mean it's, it's a sight to be seen where the candidates in such a steep dive, like as you're the canopies up top, as your pitch over your body is actually above the canopy, so it hits and they them into the ground. It's a, it's like a wet, wet meat on concrete it, you know. Exactly. And you can hear it coming because the canopy is whistle. The lines that suspend you underneath the canopy that are cutting through the air and you just hear it. You look up and then Wham, uh, as far as actually physically watching people go in May too, I think. But you know, my last trip to Switzerland in 2016 last year, I was in a, in the valley with my buddy Alex and we were there for two weeks and 15 people when in 15. Yep. Now how many people were there that it's hard to say.

Speaker 2:          01:32:36       And that's why, again, I think you have to be careful talking about the stats and the risk because I don't really know how many people partake in that activity, but I can tell you this, of those 15, zero, we're gear related, not a single one was because their gear failed. It was in my opinion, somebody attempting or just living there or walking on a razor blade and sometimes when I go over there I'll I will do that as well. I'll fly close to the ground or I'll fly in between. Trees were all fly through a crack and mess around with that. But I, I try to do it on a very limited time period. I try to have outs and I try to work my way into that position and what I have seen personally, which doesn't mean that this. This is the norm. What I have personally seen with my own eyes is people that don't take that route and they want to go straight to just, hey, hold my beer and there's just no room for air. Yeah. That's a lot of people though. Like W, w, w, what percentage of the people don't like, how many people were there? I don't know. Probably a couple hundred as far. Oh Jesus. Well that's just 115 people. Croaked yeah, that's a lot.

Speaker 2:          01:33:42       That's a login. I tried it. Again, I try to be honest. I accept the activity. Here's my thing. I don't ever want to gamble but I am willing to take risk and I know that that activity has some risk associated with it but for me personally the benefit outweighs the risk and I also spend most of my year trying to put in place things that can mitigate that risk. Like jumping all the time and being current in my suit and I like I'll walk away but I've been at plenty of exit points where the weather wasn't good or the wind wasn't good or I just wasn't feeling it. And I think a lot of other peanut pool probably had the same feelings and there's zipping up their suit, getting ready to go. And I'm like, peace out man. I'll see you later. I'm going go drink a bottle of red wine and you know, have a glass.

Speaker 2:          01:34:22       Yeah, I don't, I don't, I would love to be the base jumper that has walked away from more exits than anybody else on earth. More than I would like to be the base jumper that's done more extreme shit than anybody else on earth. Like how many times you think you've walked away, how many times have you gotten to a situation where you're at the starting line? You're like, this doesn't feel right. 15, 20. Wow. And some of those things will give you a two hour hike on the way down, you know? And I kinda don't want to hike down. That's what gets a lot of people too is they'll get, they'll, there's a lot of hiking involved, like the youtube videos. That's about five percent of what it actually takes. My favorite jump in Switzerland is about a two and a half to a three hour walk for a 92nd flight.

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       So the ratio of busting your ass to smiling is very askew. It's like Disneyland pretty much, except it's actually fun and it's not full of pedophiles. So does anyone else feel a pedophile? Of course really working. The kids are. Where would you go if you were a pedophile? And think of it that way. Come on now. It's like being a freak and go into the Strip club. Come on. There you go. You know what kills me about Disneyland? My kids love Disneyland, so we go there quite often. There's these gangs, Disneyland gangs. Have you ever seen them before? What are you talking? They were vests like they're in the hell's angels and their vests are covered with a Disneyland buttons and Patches and Disneyland Employees. You're talking about? Oh No. These are gangs of Disneyland fans and they used to have entry a admission things where like to get in there there see the Disneyland gangs.

Speaker 1:          01:35:50       Do you remember what I was saying? His empire a second ago about the pedophiles? Yeah. Hitchhikers. Disneyland Waltz, misfits. So cow. Yeah, with a skull with Disneyland hat on. And these people go in there. They have a things that would have. They would have to have like little things too that they would have to accomplish to get entry into these gangs. And one of the things was they would have to have one of the rides go down so they'd have to make a ride go down in order to get entry into this stupid fucking gang. How does one do that? Throw something into the gears. That's good. Thank you for that. When we were there, this one dumb lady, this is how fucking geniuses dummy was. California screaming is the roller coaster where you do that loop where you go upside down. Okay. On the top of the loop.

Speaker 1:          01:36:38       This dummy through her purse and wanted to catch it on the way down. Like she had this idea how that work. It didn't work. It hit the ground. The it hit first. The rollercoaster ran over, it stopped the rollercoaster and they got stuck like three quarters of the way up through loop. And you know everybody's like yet, yeah, they stopped the rollercoaster. She went to jail. Another you want to hear something really gross. One couple. They had a two year old kid and they caught them on security cam after the fact. They hung back and they put their kid near a Disneyland employee and they went, uh, went away and stepped away. So the kid was like, confused in what to do. So this Disneyland employee kept an eye on the kid and then called security and the security took care of the kid and then they went to dinner and they had drinks and they went out and then they went and retrieved a kid afterwards. Security. Not everybody should have kids, but just imagine the monster. Do you have to be to take your two year old kid? You're like, I'm tired of having this kid. Hey, I've got a great idea. Oh, I'm sure their home life is amazing. Very nourishing monsters, man. And you wonder, like when you see a school shooting or something crazy like what happened? This kind of shit does. You're raising a potential human being. This kind of shit happens.

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       You have some fucking morons. They're allowed to have kids. And then basically shit shit on an innocent victim, which is my biggest issue with it. Yeah. I cannot, I don't like the victimization of innocent people. It drives me nuts. Yeah, man, especially little two year olds, it's crazy. It's crazy that someone has that in them that they could be that fucking stupid that they have that in them and you know, I wish that this was an isolated instance. I'm sure there's like quite a few of those. I'm sure there probably is. I can't believe you're drinking that Kombucha stuff. That's good. I love it. It doesn't. The Brian Brain do the same thing for your gut. No, no. That's a nootropic and the right brain is alcohol. It's probably bad for your gut. I'm trying to counteract the effects. I had a sense of Kimchi either. Absolutely not from for the mind, spent some time in Korea and watch this guys pulling that stuff out of the ground and they would offer.

Speaker 3:          01:38:50       It's like, I'm, no, I don't want to Kimchi. I'm more convinced now than ever that. Plus having a bunch of really good podcasts, guests that explained the benefits of probiotics and about how probiotics literally affect your gut ecosystem that affects your personality and your immune system and just all sorts of different aspects of your life. But I've been eating Kimchi sheet almost when I'm at home daily. Pretty much daily food by itself. One, pair it with a meal, a pair it with a meal usually, but sometimes I'll just open up a jar and just eat a whole jar of the shit. That's disgusting. Don't do books. Today I had Kimchi with elk and Jalapenos and uh, some stuff called no bread. Knows a company that makes k n, O, w. They make these gluten free breads that are made with nuts and almonds. And how's it taste good?

Speaker 3:          01:39:49       It's actually tastes good. No, not totally. Not like a good piece of San Francisco. Sour dough bread does not taste like that, but that's what it tastes like, but it tastes good enough. It's good for me. And most importantly, it doesn't Jack up your glycaemic index. It doesn't, you know, you don't have an insulin spike. You feel good after you eat it, you still, uh, you still reading the Quito train? Most of the time I will fuck off on occasion. I will fuck off. I fucked off all. Last week I was in Hawaii and I fucked off hard. Thanksgiving was an interesting adventure diet for me too. I drank every night a dessert every day I ate whatever I wanted. I said, I'm on vacation. I'm going to treat this like a vacation. I'm going to have no restraint and I'm only gonna gain four pounds. And I worked out every day.

Speaker 3:          01:40:35       I worked at every day. Why does it only take one week to unravel what seems like a lifetime of work. And then you start climbing back into the saddle, like, okay, cool. I guess I'll just move an inch at a time here in the last two miles along the way. Well, the good news is I kept working out so it wasn't like I came back home like terribly out of shape, feeling terrible and having gotten drunk every night. I bet if I didn't work every day, I probably would have gained like seven or eight pounds. Oh, 100 percent, you'd probably at least still kept your metabolism. Metabolism of the high. Yeah, but I was like, this is what I'm going do. I'm gonna treat it like this. I'm going to work out every day so that I don't have to think about it, so I could just go crazy. You're managing guilt?

Speaker 3:          01:41:15       Yeah, I eat. I ate breakfast one day and uh, we stayed at this place that had a buffet and they had chocolate croissants I had for chocolate croissants and then I had two pieces of banana bread and I had to sticky buns, these sticky buns. Then. Then I had all sorts of other food on top of that. I just ate like a, like a glutton. Isn't that amazing? I don't usually do that. So it was nice to do it for a vacation. Amazing. For a day or two. Yeah. But I felt so weak, like when I would go to the gym, I literally felt like it was working out underwater. Like my brother just combating all the booze and all the shitty food. Would that. Or I'll find my gas tank is just done. Like you start, you normally like, okay, I'm going to warm up and you're just like, oh yeah, I think I'm done here, let's place that a heavy bag.

Speaker 3:          01:42:01       And I knew they had a heavy bag so I bought boxing gloves and hand wraps and everything and I have a timer on my phone so I set the timer up and I just wailed away. It's fucking great because you know those apple ear pods pod, probably the best apple not to make an ad for apple. Probably the best thing I've ever bought from apple. Airpods are great. And here's the thing, when you have a um, this timer, it would play me music but then the timer, like the noise of the time, but it would also go through the air pods. Didn't given both. Yeah. So when it was getting like 10 seconds it would alert me through the. But I would think like, oh man, punching the bag and even kicking the bag. Those air pods are gonna fall out. Nope. Yeah, they didn't.

Speaker 3:          01:42:37       I've actually yet to have them fall out. Yeah. Regardless. The only time I've had them falls when I was doing chin ups because my shoulders are so fucking massive. It touched my ears so it didn't fall out. They were ripped out by your massive shoulders. They just. My ears bumped up against my my shoulders, but that's it. That's the only time I've ever ever accidentally fallen out. But what's interesting is you take one out and it knows that you have it out. So the sound stops like, how the fuck did they figure that out? Wizardry out have no problem talking to you while you have headphones on. They just start talking like they see the headphones and they just start talking to you to pretend like you can't hear them and you pointed the headphones and they're like, no, no, no. You have to talk to me.

Speaker 3:          01:43:21       They talk louder. I don't give a fuck if you're on the phone. I don't give a fuck if you're in the middle of the most important audio book ever getting the secrets of the universe right now, people won't talk to you, man. I think that might be more of a problem that you deal with as opposed to others, but I think girls get it more than me. I know words. I know women who have put a headphones into their ears and not even attached it to a device. That's good. Just so people will leave them alone. Just stick it right in there posting. I don't know if you can hear. Yeah, I don't. I don't know if would necessarily

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       work. What island did you go to? Hawaii? Um, my favorite is Lanai. Is that where you guys went for Thanksgiving? We went to the big island this time. Nice split. I think Linda is the way to go because they ain't nobody there. And you gotta take two flights from La. Hulu? Yeah. You got to go to Honolulu and then you take a little puddle jumper. A little one of them. Little buddy holly killing planes.

Speaker 4:          01:44:16       I guess. Imagine backpack

Speaker 1:          01:44:18       you can borrow. They ask how much your packs. Oh No, don't say that. How much do you weigh, sir? Don't lie. Please don't lie. Actually padded by about 10 percent. You're going to be okay. I wonder if what they do, if they get like a really overly weight person who they know might be full of shit. Like I don't want to find out what happens ladies. I know what happens. They Jack up a couple of pounds when I was super young. Like I just, I remember that I went on a cruise with my grandparents to Alaska. I don't know where we started, but we went up to Alaska when we were flying back from Alaska puddle jumper to probably do now to get on the plane and they looked at my grandfather like a little up and down. Like, sir, you're on the next flight.

Speaker 1:          01:44:56       Really? Yep. They bumped him. GRANDPA had a gut grandpa. He was, he was built big boy. He was. He was built from the belly button up to the chest, like a beach ball. Hey Man. Some like I wouldn't want to be in a puddle jumper with a really big guy that was full of shit. No, you'll kill everybody at some point. The plans like, Hey, I know you're pulling back on the yoke, but I actually can't take off, so you're all going to die now, and that's not the way to go either. Right? Because someone has an ego and they can't tell you. There are 400 pounds, not 50. Yeah. So they. I think they actually took his luggage off and he had to come back like that. I think it was the next day. Well, the real problem is for someone who's 400 pounds, they have to find a scale that goes up to 400 pounds or you get a time and as it goes around.

Speaker 1:          01:45:41       But Joey Diaz was telling me that when he was 400 pounds, like they, he didn't. He didn't know how much you weighed because the scale at his doctor's office only went to 300 pounds and you have that. Imagine that pegged bang, and then he'd lose 50 pounds and it would still be pegged. I think that's not a good sign. No, I mean I'm not a doctor obviously, but I think that all this stuff, when you see all these people that are like morbidly obese, I think this is all a. there's a lot of things right? This shitty food. There's a bad gut flora addict addiction to like refined carbohydrates and sugars, alcohol, a lot of things that make people that fat, but on top of that, I think a lot of it is that they don't have like real physical challenges in their life on a daily basis. Especially physical challenges that they enjoy. That forces them to be disciplined about their health and to understand that their body is. It's not just your body, okay. It's like you have this variable vehicle and the time you put

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       into it, the more you pay attention to it and the more discipline you use to keep this thing running, the better it's going to work for you and if you use it all the time, you're gonna appreciate it. But if you just use it to walk over to the couch and crack a beer and start fucking filling your face with chips and cookies, you don't think about what it is and you don't have to rely on it to survive. You don't have to chop wood. You have to. You don't have to carry anything.

Speaker 2:          01:47:13       You gotta go. You gotta. Look on your phone for the right APP to have uber. Deliver your food so you don't even have to get off of your ass. That's a new thing. It's a new thing, but I bet she gets pretty popular. But it doesn't come to your neck of the woods. I bet I wouldn't order it. Even if it did. I don't have restaurants in your town. Well, yes. We also have electricity and running water. No, we do a lot. You had a. well I do at my house we have in the woods. Oh, that's amazing. Well you should come visit sometime. Wells. I liked the idea of water is God damn. It's good. Oh yeah. Unbelievably clear. Spring water. It just tastes different. It tastes different to A. Yeah, I it, I liked the small town we have, we have everything we need. Probably a couple things that we probably still need and not much of what we don't. Is there any crime? I'm sure. I actually. Yeah, I bet you there's some, a little bit off the rails. Crime I think any place, so we don't live in white fish. White fish is like 15 miles north of us. I'm pretty sure there's a large like white nationalists, white supremacists.

Speaker 3:          01:48:21       I've read some stuff about it. I haven't really looked into it too much, but I knew that they were getting ready to do a little bit of a march type action rally. You should walk around everywhere in black face. I don't think that's the call. I don't have an Afro. I was thinking of just driving my truck through the white nationalist rally is because my truck is black so. Right. Yeah. That would be the metaphor. So if one of them Tiki torches and see if you feel me, man, let's fucking dickheads. Oh, those dickheads in Charlotte walking on the street with home depot torches. I still can't figure out if they're serious. Oh, they're serious. There've been with Home Depot Tiki torch in your hand. You're serious. Yeah, they're serious. They just want a torch and they're so fucking stupid. They don't really tell that that's going to be mocked, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:49:10       I don't know if they even care. I think they're just glad they're either getting coverage so that they feel that their message is getting out to everybody who needs to hear it in their mind, but he didn't need to hear it because most people didn't know that there was a group that duck fucking stupid that's willing to go into the streets like that and do it in this day and age when you're on the Internet and people are gonna Realize, Oh, you're a Nazi swastika on your chest. You dumb cunt. Oh, okay. Yeah. There you go, buddy. I don't know if it's that bad up in white fish, but I do know that there is. I have found is like you eat to the remote areas. It seems like a drug related crime might be a tad higher. Gets a little messy. Yeah. I was gonna say, but I'm not sure. I mean

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       anecdotally I think from my perspective, that's what it seems to be like, but I haven't. I mean I feel super comfortable. I don't feel. Yeah, I mean, I don't know. It feels, it feels smaller is the only way that I can describe it and that feeling fuels awesome. Yeah, it's peaceful, right? Yeah. So like not a great word for sure. It's slower to it is. Like I said, the only regret is that I wish we had. I wish we had been able to do it. Well we would. We were able to do it. We just didn't do it. I wish we had done it a couple of years ago. Yeah, I felt that way about boulder. Boulder feels like that too. Vain. Boulder feels to me like, you know, it's only a 100,000 people, which is way bigger than your town. Twenty 2000. That's crazy. But it just, everything is like, oh, it's just a calmer folders and interesting town.

Speaker 1:          01:50:32       It reminded me a lot of where I grew up in Santa Cruz, very left like great place. If you're selling Tofu, Santa Cruz is a great place to grow up. The problem is, is that a lot of people don't leave Santa Cruz. It's, it's so far left that it ends up on the right somehow there. Yeah, it's insane. And I, you know, the guys and girls that I went to high school with, a couple of them have never left and not that I haven't really maintained contact with them, but even if I did, I don't know if I'd have anything to talk to them about. It's such an insulated and the like. So the small town that we live in, I'm like, I want my kids when they grow up and they get to that age, they get to leave. They got to go and experience something else.

Speaker 1:          01:51:07       I don't want them to think that that 22,000 people is, this is how the world is. It's not the best thing I did in Santa Cruz was leaving at some point. Um, friend of mine has been on the podcast before, used to be on this podcast called citizens radio and he was a, um, like a real heavy duty lefty social justice warrior type character. And somewhere along the line he ran afoul of them because he dates girls like girls. Girls were calling them a Predator or something like that. It really didn't do anything wrong. Like if you look at it on paper, like, okay, what did he do wrong? There was nothing. There was no rape, there was no assault, there was no harassing. It was him trying to get laid a which I thought was normal, but I guess not in that world it's problematic.

Speaker 1:          01:51:53       But in the social justice world, it's problematic to be an aggressive. A Sexual Predator she did is actually had attorney and really not cool at all. But what he said was that when he was in that world, he didn't even, wasn't even aware of dissenting viewpoints because he was so insulated because everybody in that world thought a certain way. And so you just get accustomed to these very rigid sort of channels of thinking and everybody sort of follows these channels and he literally wasn't even aware of the possibility of there being a dissenting point of view that was rational. How do people not realize that that's inherently dangerous? They get caught up in it. People are super tribal, you know, I don't have to tell you that I made. Yeah, I agree. But it's at the same point, like I try to recognize myself, like if I'm whatever, consuming anything information.

Speaker 1:          01:52:47       If I'm like, okay, I need to go and figure something else out or hear another viewpoint or at least try to balance it to me. Like the spidey senses started going up. If too many people are saying the same thing, if everybody is all chanted in the sense like what's going on with you might be down the rabbit hole here. We need to take a few steps back. Yeah, but that's because you are a winner. Some people are just not tiger blood, but I'm trying. There's some things that people have that are like unfortunate. And one of the things that people have is this deep desire to have other people like them and to fit in and to cause zero friction and to, to be amenable to the group think, you know, it's like it's a real. It's a common issue with folks like you see them like just slotting into group think ideology and whether it's group think on the right side, a group thing.

Speaker 1:          01:53:39       I mean there's a lot of fucking really dumb people that I follow on twitter that are a make America great again. People like, I'll go to Hashtag Maga every now and then and just start reading tweets and just just like fucking macaulay culkin from home alone. My hand on my head going, oh my God, these people are serious. No, drain the swamp. Hashtag drain the swamp. And I'll go and I'll read these people's tweets. I'm like, these people are just apes that are in a tribe. They, they, they are really, really. Not all of them folks, don't get me wrong. There's a lot of people that are making America great again. People that really do feel like it's a good thing to have this guy in office, stock market's up, I'm not talking about you, but I'm talking about people that have this tiny little brain and this tiny little brain just needs to slot into a place and this is where they found this is their spot and then you go onto their twitter page and these motherfuckers are on all day arguing with people about trump all day accomplishing nothing.

Speaker 1:          01:54:41       No, but they feel like they've got a huge microphone and they're getting absolutely nowhere. Yeah. And they just everyday they just constantly checking their responses, checking their tweets, chicken. They're thing back and forth, back and forth. You know what scares me about that is it again, I feel like I'm late to the game to everything and, and social media late to the game. A podcasting late to the game. Like I was telling you like I'm trying to play catch up and I used to look at the news and largely accept, you know what? I could corroborate on each side and now I can't look at any of that. And so I just have to use my own eyes, but I see with my own eyes, people arguing with their head down so much about what they believe that they're actually not seeing what's happening around them and because nobody trusts anything and they only repeat what they say, it provides the seams for people to do shit that as a country, I don't think we want to go in that direction in that distraction moves are being made that people aren't paying attention to.

Speaker 1:          01:55:37       Yeah. And I feel like with all this thing about trump and Russia and everybody thinking that flint is going to turn on trump and this is it. We're going to. Trump's going down, trump's going down like, hey guys, North Korea's got nuclear capability and they've just launched some new fucking missile icbm. Yeah, high end orbit. That's cable reaching America. Do you understand what's happening? And we're, we're sending stealth bombers over to South Korea like we are. We are literally a few steps away from the brink of a nuclear war. We're not there yet, but we're in the. We're, we're where we should. Everybody should be going, hey, hey, hey, hey, what was the fuck is going on over here? Yeah. Like what is this? Why are we even battling them? What the fuck is the issue? Other than the fact that. I mean if you want to talk about going somewhere where you have a real communist dictatorship, that is a ruth ruth iron fist military dictatorship that has an entire country of people in slaved North Korea's a spot.

Speaker 1:          01:56:38       I mean it really is a video of that defector whole Lee Shit. My pulled out a mama hen got Swiss cheese and just kept the foot on the gas pedal. Kept going there. Not as truck shot him. Oh, you have five or six times. Six times riddled with like parasites. Yeah. Big Parasites. Like two feet long. My man. I mean, there you go. Well, what motivates somebody to run that hard and that fast and he made it and he made it. He must be sleeping so good right now. Yeah. Was probably getting fed for the head on the pillow. I mean, just imagine how he'll kind of look at this dude.

Speaker 1:          01:57:17       Get Out, get some. I'll fall down, buddy. Nice. Okay. I probably played it off though. He's like, yeah, I wouldn't want to shoot syrup. Is that all they have now? They have the full thing. You know, you get the nightline version of it so you can get the full actual video of the full actual video of. It's pretty interesting. He was getting shot at in the car. Yeah. You can see the trace around and they're really close to them. Yeah. It doesn't necessarily mean anything. I've missed close shots. Panicking. It's welcome. Here it is. This guys just hauling ass. Here's my question. You think he was playing the radio like metallica planned? Kickstart my heart. Yeah. Metallica. I'm going forward North Korea. Soldiers for sue, the man while he flees and a military vehicle. What kind of cars you got there? It looked like a jeep. It looks like a land rover down, so he stops the car. He gets out and he's running and they're shooting at him from six feet away. Fortunately the guy on the far right's got a pistol. He's not hitting shit. He's tripping over his buddy back. Ooh, that guy's got a rifle though.

Speaker 1:          01:58:17       Oh my God. The Korean soldier accidentally clock crosses into South Korea during the pursuit. So that's the line right there. I do not know. So that's all you have to take. Turns around. So there's not a fence. I don't know. You just have to get to that spot and I don't know about the DMZ shot and injured. The factor is pulled to safety by the South Korean military. Whoa, that's amazing. Oh, these people crawling. That looks like the South Korean people. Yeah, they're dragging him. Holy Cow. I didn't know about this.

Speaker 3:          01:58:47       Oh my God. See the blood trail. Oh, that's what. That is. More than likely on a thermal. Oh, that's intense. That's intense.

Speaker 1:          01:58:58       So you want to talk about an iron fist dictator that's happening right now and people, all they can think of is just looking at that guard. Go look at him. Go. He's out gear. Yeah, I don't. I don't know the rules on the DMZ or where the actual line is. If this video on like South Korea's side, is that how they. Someone saw this taken place. So it looks like he's driving from north to south. Yeah. Does he just have to get across that gate? So this is this like a DMZ. It's almost like an unedited version. The second at 10 minute version of it. Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:59:34       I guess they just constantly monitor everything. How weird must that tension between the north and south of staring at each other in the opposite side of the line. And they both look exactly the same. They're both Korean, you know, it's like the US wall with Mexico. People go, oh, it's racist, it's racist because one, people are proud and when people are white they can't even say it's racist over there. They're both the same race just looking at each other. And then there were a war. They hate each other and one's the enemy and one's not. One has no money. One is under the iron rule of a communist military dictatorship where they kill everybody. The other one, they're making the best cell phones in the world. Chicks were all getting plastic surgery, you know, the boys are all fucking hip hop break dancers and shit and like they have mma over there. They have everything that South Korea is that tag windows pretty fucking awesome

Speaker 1:          02:00:26       souls and awesome town. Yeah, I've been there. I spent my 20th birthday in Seoul, Korea, and a bar.

Speaker 3:          02:00:33       People that think that socialism and communism is the answer to the woes that capitalism creates. Do not understand you. Just missing the point that is. It's so contrary to human nature and it is, by the way, never been pulled off successfully in human history.

Speaker 1:          02:00:50       Yeah. I would love an example and that's what I always ask people. Just give me the example of what you want to use as the foundation for those principals where it's been executed properly, where it's thrived, where it's survived and I'll just sit here and wait, and another part of the problem is that the people that are really like the people that are in the left that are really progressive and support Marxism, the idea of Marxism and socialism, those people are in general, very supportive of gay rights, very supportive of women's rights. Those are the first things that get trampled and his communist dictatorships. That is the first thing that goes like every single one of these communists, Marxists rules, homosexuality is treated as the devil like these people. Did they live in hell that you don't understand. It is very for me,

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       after a long period of time, the majority of my adult life to pick my head up and look around

Speaker 1:          02:01:47       and

Speaker 2:          02:01:49       and it most of the interaction, like I said, as social media, I sit back and I watch and I see the things that people say and I see the complaints that they have and oppressed this, this, that or the other, and I'll be the first person to say that there is inequality in the US. Just like there is an every nation on the face of the planet. But to hear how people think, how bad we have it, and then to have seen with my own eyes. Places where people would

Speaker 1:          02:02:17       claw their way,

Speaker 2:          02:02:19       cross the border, to have the opportunities that people in this country have just waking up. The Sun rises over the United States and they wake up and they have so much opportunity that they don't appreciate. It's very difficult for me to make sense of what's going on. It's a bizarre place to be in because it's just like who? Who are you people and where do you get these ideas there?

Speaker 1:          02:02:40       Idealistic and they think that we can do better and I think that we can do better too, but I think where people go a foul is where they start saying that they want equality of outcome and equality of outcome is contrary to equality because when you have a quality, a quality, really quality meaning you can do whatever you want to do. That breeds inequality. Yes, because some people are going to work harder and competition is what pushes things and some people think that competition is bad and the reason why they think it's bad because it makes them feel bad. Like I put something on twitter today where they were saying that fit bits that people using fitbit's is fat shaming and abelist and it's problematic and it causes all sorts of issues and these, these educators, we're looking at fitbit's as being a real problem with the emotions of people.

Speaker 1:          02:03:35       You know, they find out like in. They start comparing and it can cause all sorts of issues with people, so they were literally saying that fitbit's, they're just devices that give you data that these things can be a problem. How about competition's a good thing? It's a good thing. Yeah. How about it's okay to finish last because it will motivate you to get off your ass. You still on the leaderboard? Exactly. Yeah. Go again. You don't win every time. Stupid. It scares me that people are in positions like I'm looking at. My oldest son is 14 and

Speaker 2:          02:04:07       I mean I realized that at some point in time in the very near future he's going to go off and you know, he's gonna want to pursue a higher education and I almost would rather send them to a trade school where he learns something with his hands or I would hope that he would. I would never tell him to do that. I would hope that he would want to go down that route instead of going into an environment that is completely artificial where people portray this world of no rounded corners in nerfed everything and you, your feelings in words hurt and all. He talks about it all the time. Actually I don't my son to go into

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       that environment. He's already experiencing that a little bit in the school system that is in like he uses the word triggered and heal. His teachers will use that word triggered and I'm like, listen, it's okay to have somebody say something to you that invokes a reaction or emotion in you that causes conflict. That's okay. Don't run away from that conflict. Once you go directly, add that conflict and figure out what your problem is with it or figure out why you have an issue with that and then work through that and you'll be a better person on the other side of the house. I feel like these were in a place now where people are creating. It's an artificial environment that as soon as you leave that environment, you're going to get your teeth kicked in and I don't. I see it trending more and more and more in the u.

Speaker 1:          02:05:20       s and I almost think we're getting ready to fall flat on our face and I almost think we need to to figure out who the fuck we are and to pick ourselves back up into, into realize that those artificial environments that people are trying to force onto the world. It just doesn't work in campus. Cities and towns that have campuses. Yeah. It's just, it's just really heavy duty leftwing people that are just committed to this ideology and they don't have a. I mean, it's good to have both sides. I think it's good to have people that lean left and people that lean right and you try to figure out which, yeah, balanced way works and by the way it's gonna work better for some way. Some people to be left and is going to work better. For some people it'll be right, but this lack of tolerance for other people's ideas is one of the most shocking things about the left these days is this, this need and desire to shut down speech.

Speaker 1:          02:06:14       You know, um, there was also the people who are on the forefront of saying, you know, freedom of speech, but not that, not anymore, you know, they used to be. The new left is more stifling of free speech than the right by far the new left would, you know, you'd call neo Marxism or postmoderns. I guess I look at it differently, like freedom of speech to me in my mind is not about what I can say to you. It's not about me saying I'm going to say something, you know, messed up and try to offend you. To me, freedom of speech is how much can I tolerate from somebody else? How much am I willing to listen to an opinion that I absolutely hate, but I'm going to allow it to exist because I'm grateful that we have an environment that that can exist in and you're not going to get pulled into a public square and get your head cut off?

Speaker 1:          02:06:57       Well, there's certainly that, but there's also the only way you find out which idea is correct is you have to have debate. You have to have open debate. You have to have the ability to communicate your ideas freely, and if you don't have the ability to communicate your ideas freely and the other person just bulldozes you with their ideas because they think they're right and I'm going to shut down everyone else's opinion because I'm right. That's not how you handle free speech. The way you have to tell you that opinion isn't allowed, right? Yup. You handle bad speech with more better speech you, you, you become. You have to have your arguments laid out in a way that's convincing to the people that are paying attention and you can't do that if your speech is stifled and that's what's really a problem with the left these days and it's just.

Speaker 1:          02:07:40       And I think a big part of it is these artificial environments you're talking about the they, they, they live in these insulated things. Like I was saying, Jamie Kilstein used to live in. They live in these insulated environments where they think they're right and they think they're doing the right thing by behaving like this, but it's so short sighted. And I, and again, I don't, I don't try to make a character judgment on them, but to me in my mind again with, with my own eyes, I think the biggest threat to this country is political correctness and safe spaces. Yeah. I truly think that teaching people in that manner or getting them, not getting them, allowing them to think that that is how the world outside of that environment operates is setting you up for a very longterm failure because you're going to just get crushed because there are plenty of other entities throughout the world that we'll look at what you're doing and say, oh, that's awesome.

Speaker 1:          02:08:28       You're just teeing it up for me. That's a complete vulnerability. They're going to leverage that against us and manipulate, not manipulate, just attack the fact that those people feel that way. They'll take it as a weakness and they'll leverage that for their success and with them we're fucked. Yeah. I don't necessarily think we're fucked because I think there's enough people that are paying attention to think it's terrible and there's a lot of us, but I think that when something like nine slash 11 happens, one of the things that I thought that was really interesting right after nine slash 11 was his rallying cry of patriotism. Like everybody had an American flag on their car just like this is. This is interesting to me. Did they have them hanging over the overpasses up here in la? Oh yeah, in San Diego that week. I would say it was about a week after nine slash 11.

Speaker 1:          02:09:10       I have never in my life, felt a level of solidarity of, of just. Not only that, but people were nicer. They were nicer. They were more upset. There wasn't. They weren't really worried that you cut them off in traffic. You know what? Take the parking spot. Yeah, no, you can put your cart in front of me. Not Grocery store for us against them. How fleeting was that freedom hall, but it was amazing during that time period to the overpasses and San Diego, American flags hanging like not just an American flag covered the entire thing. It was unbelievable. I've in longer in New York, New York, it lasts for a long time. They kind of have a daily reminder. Yeah. The feeling there was different. They were just to change the Way New York City was New York City. It was almost like a village, so we have a friendly village that had been attacked and everybody was like super thankful that they were alive and supportive of each other and also the solidarity. You know, Sebastian younger is a war journalist. You ever heard of him? I've listened to every podcast you've done with him. Restrepo is one of my favorite documentaries. He's fucking amazing. His book tribe changed the way I understand that. I'm like, oh, this is a natural part of being human, and like we were talking about these reward systems that are built into animals that loud tigers and like they, they don't get the natural release. These natural reward systems for good or for bad human beings are designed to deal with conflict, look real conflict,

Speaker 3:          02:10:33       and when we don't have real conflict, we make up our own bullshit conflict and when real conflict shows itself, then everything sort of normalizes and that's. I mean it's for good or for bad. We haven't evolved past that. Whatever our DNA is, whatever our programming is and are very almost at a cellular level. We're designed to have a certain amount of risk and when we don't have that risk and we don't have that danger, we don't feel good and you lash out at people with your egg icon. These motherfuckers, I'm going to kill you unless you were here in my face and then I wouldn't say that I'm going to kill it. Yeah, it was a credit. I mean, I remember watching the second airplane go in live, standing in an apartment in San Diego thinking this might change some things. Yeah. Yeah. I remember just waking up.

Speaker 3:          02:11:24       Someone called me. Where were you living at the time I was here, was getting some phone calls from friends. I was like, what? Turn on the news. Turn on the news. He turned on the news and you're like, just having an all sink in. Like what the fuck? And then me and man, I used to have a picture of it. Me and Eddie Bravo and Joey Diaz went to get burritos and there wasn't a fucking plane in the sky and we're hanging out that day because all air travel had been suspended and we were just hanging out thinking how fucking bizarre it as we're like, dude, are we at war? Like what the hell? How is this going to change everything? Did Eddie feel better because there weren't econ trails up there. He wasn't the same guy back then. He wasn't that deep into it. No, no. He liked aliens back then.

Speaker 3:          02:12:05       He was into like Nibiru. He as he became older, he became way more conspiratorial. I have a hard. I know I've texted you before like, hey, does he actually think those things or is he. He loves conspiracies. I think he thinks of them almost like some people like paying attention to sports, but then there's also like Illuminati stuff that he legitimately worries that like Hillary Clinton is going to off him because he talks to his shed about I fucking. I think it's entirely possible the Clintons are murderers. I think it's entirely possible themselves are outsourced. Outsourced yet. I don't think they have the stones to do something, so I don't think so, but I think they've definitely made some calls or at least had some meetings. I, uh, just too many bodies, many people attached to them that were in critical positions that either like, one recent guy vanished. Does that Seth Rich Guy who is the New Yorker Dad worked at the DNC that got shot. There's, there's enough of them and then they go away. The stories go away. The one that I pulled up the other day who was a who's who would, who would we do in the podcast was the guy who had dirt on the Clinton campaign. It was an academic and he vanished. The guy vanished and you don't hear about it. This guy was about to like give dirt on the Clinton Foundation and they're like, whoops. He's just not around anymore.

Speaker 2:          02:13:31       Can't find them. I think their ability to hide and not just their academic at heart of Clinton dirt champion vanishes leaving trail of questions because he's still missing. Oh, this is a part of the Russia investigation. That's right. It wasn't the Clinton campaign. It wasn't the Clinton Foundation. Yeah, he's gone, man. It's fucking missing. Poof, I did. I just think it's amazing the ability for people to have the public face and then who they are. I have A. I have not personally had any interactions with Hillary Clinton, but I have some firsthand friends that have had direct interactions with her from either a security detail perspective or being on the ground and securing an area that she was traveling through and the public face that she puts on and how she treated those individuals up to and including people that were tasked with her personal security, upclose detailed the store is that those people have would melt your hair, but none of those stories come out.

Speaker 2:          02:14:31       There's the person that she portrays herself to be during the election cycle and this is who I am, and then he talked to all these people who live at a day to day level with these people and the difference between the two is like sitting there trying to broad jump the grand canyon. It absolutely blows my mind. The is about her in particular and her hatred or what they had told me her hatred for basically in essentially people in military or people who were there to support her doing her job. Just the anger and vitriol that she would attack those people with on a daily level is unbelievable anger at the military and angry 100 percent of the. She was literally campaigning to be the commander in chief of the military just because it comes out of how did she behave to them? Uh, one of the best stories that I have was a, I won't say the Agency of the person worked for was basically she was exiting the White House and he said, good morning, Ms Dot Clinton.

Speaker 2:          02:15:28       And he was in a uniform at the time and she stopped and turned around and she said, hey, why don't you go fuck yourself? Don't talk to me when I'm, you know, in going in between place a to place b, wherever she was going, got back in her car. Fuck yourself more that I have that version of the story again, not personally for me. I'm basically saying the things that I've heard other people say to me in confidence directly, but their uniform, these stories correct. Uniformed, whether that be. It could be a military secret service, fill in the blank. They wear a uniform also in the way these stories. She 100 percent. It's exactly the same behavior when the cameras are not rolling and it's fucking terrifying because yes, she is. She is campaigning or was campaigning to be the commander in chief of, from what I can tell again, having no direct relations with this person, a person that despises almost I would describe, I would describe it at that is what the organization stands for. Unbelievable. I'm not surprised. Uh, what stunned me is how the left was willing to just absolve her of her.

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       She was against gay marriage until 2013. Her obvious belief system, the like, who she actually is versus like what she, you don't know what she's doing is being a slick politician just like her husband publicly. She is the tide. She may also rise and fall with whatever the trend is. The 2013 thing like the fact that like how could you, who, who the fuck who's educated, who the fuck was a Democrat at 2013, still thought that a marriage should be between a man and woman who gives a shit like she did because that's what she does. She licks her fingers, she finds out whether it was blowing and she goes that way and when you see the difference between what call me, sad about the investigation and what the investigation and found on her emails and what the illegal activity that she had participated in versus what she said, you know what the deleted emails at 30,000 deleted emails and all that stuff and there's a video that shows what he said versus what she said.

Speaker 3:          02:17:28       Play them back to back with each other. It's like how anybody could support her. The idea that you wanted someone other than Donald Trump, I get it. The idea that you wanted a woman and historical first for equality of women. Do I get that too? But this is not your one. There's got to be a lot of women out there. The two choices we had at of what, 360 plus million people now God do insane. It just, it's proof that the system is broken. Yeah, I agree. It's compromised for sure. You know, the only thing good about having a guy like trump in his, he's not from the system has that he used all of his money and kind of jumped in and the financial system is still being supported obviously because he's a big part of it, but the political system is in chaos. I mean he's not a part of that at all and never was so, so besides donating money to them, that was the only thing that people thought was a saving grace about him being an office.

Speaker 3:          02:18:14       Like let's see. But I think he's crazy. I think he might literally have dementia. I just wish that somebody would grab his film. Just real. Do they try? No, just like real quick and just modify the APP. So, but before he hits tweet, it goes to like one or two people who give it just a quick sanity check, Da. And then they're like proof check twitter chats. He checks his comments, he fucking people I know people are proud about that. I've heard you talking about now I've looked at like I'm blocked by presidents like man, hilarious. But again, I look at that as people have their head down, not paying attention to what they should be paying attention to because in those seams that people blowing their mind over a tweet, what the hell is getting passed through in regulations and bills and unlike if that's the shit that scares me, the EPA shit scares me the most because you know what they're doing with the national monuments. There's people that are. They had a meeting this morning. What's up? Yeah. What do you do to the different parks that. I can't remember him, but he shrunk by a whole lot to pull it up. Yeah. It's very scary because you're carving out a land and national monuments for privatization. And there was one that um, they were, they were talking about in Alaska that's very close to a gigantic salmon fishery. Trump's shrinks, Utah monuments in historic move. I wonder which one make that bigger police or to read it.

Speaker 3:          02:19:43       If only the sandstone stands, stones could sing. Imagine the stories they tell of dinosaurs. Mammoth hunters and ancient ones known as the Anasazi. All Rome southern Utah. Over the eons longer for the native Americans struggled to hold their land against the Mormon settlers. Modern life. And now Donald Trump scroll as president trump arrives in Utah. Monday afternoon. It's this rocky corner of the wild west is a battlefield once again, but this time the warriors were carried briefcases and lawsuits. Trump by signing to presidential proclamations on Monday, shrunk the size of bears ears national monument by more than 80 percent and the grand staircase Escalante National Monument by roughly 45 percent. Fundamentally reshaping the two large national monuments. Man. Fuck that guy. I mean, what? Can you give me a why other than to say there's got to be an economical motivation behind it. Be Resources has got to be national resources got to be minerals or oil or something like that.

Speaker 3:          02:20:45       So. And that's my thing. Like why? So if you go to Fox News, right? Every, every leading above the brake article is Hillary. This hillary. Why? Why is that not leading really Americans, their little puppets. I mean, this idea that they're there just for America. No, you're a puppet of the GOP. That's what they are. Not Really American. They're fucking corrupt. They're corrupt as everybody else's. They're the worst. Like that. The thing that you, if you're, you have blind allegiance towards the president when he does stuff like this. That's crazy. You have to call it. And some people do like that. Shepherd. What's his name? Shepard Shepard Smith. Yeah, that guy. The perfect eyebrows. He calls the president and I don't know if I've ever seen as eyebrows, but I'm going to take. Seems it seems like he could have been one of those guys that was upset at Hillary Clinton up until about 2013.

Speaker 3:          02:21:38       Yeah. Um, I think, I think I hear what you're putting down there, but again, you know, so people are, they're losing their mind about tweets. And then in the monument got cut by 80 percent and another one by 45 percent. And I mean, and that's one example. I don't know that and I agree with you. They are corrupt and what I have found myself in, again, what I think is dangerous is that I've stopped paying attention and as soon as that happens, I don't know what the hell is going on. Yeah. That's what happens with a lot of people and a lot of people just want to eat meat. You feel like you can't do anything other than vote right. Boat and protest and you have a job at a family. How do you have time to protest? And so a lot of people shut out because they just don't feel like they don't feel like they can represent their opinions in a way that's going to be meaningful and impactful and it's just, it's a terrible.

Speaker 3:          02:22:25       The job of having one chief monkey, the controls, 300 plus million people and your definition. Yeah. And then here's the thing, if you are the chief monkey, if they show that you're a liar, if they can show, if there's proof that you're a liar, should be removed from office. If you get, if you are, if you are in court, right? And you swear on a Bible and the you commit perjury you'd go to jail. Like why is swearing into office for the United States? Why is that less of a like a a situation where you can be charged with perjury like that seems to me to be far more significant. You're, you're literally in control of the country. You can do things like this fucking thing that he signed that shrinks these monuments, these horrible reductions in the power that the EPA has. The fucking environmental protection agency is to protect our very environment.

Speaker 3:          02:23:26       He's like, no, no, no. We don't need that. We don't even protection. Trust me, we got me. Yeah. You would think that he would be held more accountable because the stakes are so much higher and it affects so many people. Yeah, I mean the amount of lies that he's told since office or they're stunning and you can just get away with them. You shouldn't be able to get away with lies. As a president, I think lies as a president willingly lie. There's one thing to be misinformed but willingly lying as the president, if they can show that you had information to the contrary of what you're saying, you should be removed from office should be a disqualifying factor for sure percent, 100 percent, but we've never had someone that lives this much. We just don't know about it. Well, no one has been able to be proven to be this much of a liar. We've never had that. Where someone lies so much. You're like, wow. Like there's a website that was documenting the number of times trump lied or it was like they documented all of the trump lies over the past year and it's. It's crazy. It's just so frustrating. As of June 23rd, every day. Here's a different one. Yeah, I mean, what's that? What's the website? Calls from the New York Times flies on top to scroll up and we could make it larger so I could read it here. Yeah. I don't know, man.

Speaker 3:          02:24:48       I don't want to. I don't even want to read them. I'll just get super depressed where the only issue I have with that is that people are really quick to jump on that bandwagon and all I would say is you should be prepared to have that level of scrutiny thrown back on yourself. True. Because my, I mean how fucking long, but everybody else's list B, you know, I mean that's the one thing that happened, like once you get into office, would that list be the same? Like if you knew, like if I say Andy Stump, do you swear to take the office of the United States president and then to do the whole thing hand on the Bible from there on, you've got to know that you have to keep your fucking shit together a hundred percent. You can't lie.

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       Yeah, I agree. And like I said, I'm not, I'm just, I wish people would take that level of accountability on themselves as well too. I think the country would be a better place if people acted as if there was an organization ready to write down a list of their deficiencies at any given time. I think you're totally right.

Speaker 3:          02:25:39       I think you're totally right, but I think that what we're seeing is for the first time, like a president that is showing why we have a real flaw with this idea of one person being chief

Speaker 2:          02:25:53       dog. I think he scared the piss out of people and usually a topic swings back around to like nuclear weapons or nuclear war and like, can this one guy really go and just hit the button while also the real problem?

Speaker 3:          02:26:04       Ms Dot Muniz.is very strategic. I mean he's thinking. He thought about reelection. He filed for reelection almost immediately or did he really? Yeah, there's a strategy for that too. Meaning that any like, I forget exactly what the strategy is, but it's in terms of how people are addressing him and how people are talking against him because they'll. They would be running for president. They would also be if they're running for president because he is a presidential candidate. There's like certain rules to behavior and this is a very calculated. Yeah, chest movement. It's a very. It's a big chess move, so this is what disturbs me the most about North Korea because there's one way to ensure that people want to keep the same president and that that way is wore it like once you are in a war, say if we are three plus years in, he's campaigning for president again and it escalates with North Korea. That propaganda escalates the lies the bullshit and who knows, who knows what the fuck happens and then all of a sudden there's actual military action that is going to ensure a reelection,

Speaker 2:          02:27:12       I think or would I could see that or it would flip everybody against him. I could see a swing in both ways. It could. It depends on. It depends on how scared people aren't. Depends on if we get attacked. If we get attacked, I guarantee you he wins again because nobody's going to want Bernie to in this. I'm going to go there and I'm going to promise them equality. I think if we got attacked by North Korea, yeah, his escalation might be nucular in and level and then it's. We're all. We're glowing in the dark. If that shit works, if this stuff works, I don't know. That's I tell you what, you want to talk about a war that I would want. No part of. North Korea. Oh, Daddy. Yeah. No, thank you. Rugged terrain controlled environments. No, thank you very much. And they got some big old army's just call on Elon Musk and sending the drones.

Speaker 2:          02:28:02       Those Boston dynamic drones that could do backflips get those fucking new robots that they have to tell you what. Right now the drones are carrying the lion's share. Are they? Um, yeah. I don't know if people realize how much. I mean it's, they are carrying probably the lion share of the kinetic activity throughout the globe. I mean they're, they're doing as as they can with that really know like how much drone activity things going on that we don't know about that we don't know about. I have absolutely no idea but about that would have to imagine that it is. I would have to imagine that it's substantial. It's, it's less risk from a risk to force perspective because if you're looking at it as you're the person who has the drone, it's less risk because you're not putting a physical human being at risk or launching a forest or an asset or a helicopter that could fill in the blank go wrong. And then on the other side of that risk though is that how are you really sure the person that you're going after is there. Are you really sure that they're alone? Are you really sure that you can action this target in a way that's not going to have collateral damage? So there's two different tides of, uh, two different sides of the risk and I think that right now at the American populace would probably rather not see flag draped coffins and just assume that business is being taken care of.

Speaker 2:          02:29:22       So disturbing the idea of that getting turned around on us. And even more disturbing, I think about it from that perspective of somebody launched a Tomahawk missile into downtown or not Tom Hall because they're not on fire. How far they go or j dot m or fill in the blank in an La. China flies a drone over or whatever. North Korea flies a drone over and they just juiced the US bank building in downtown La. How would we respond to that? It's, I mean, I sit back and I freaked. I kick my. I just do mental judo in my head trying to figure out what the Hell I did with almost 20 years of my life and did it actually do anything important and where whereas everything going and like, what the fuck was I doing for so long it I struggled with it quite often. How so?

Speaker 2:          02:30:12       I worry that. So my biggest fear is that my children would have to finish something that I started, but I also think that the success that we had as a military drove the creation of the enemy that we're fighting. We took an organization that was largely geographically co located and we were so effective at finding them when they met in groups of people that they splintered and they spread apart, which is, you know why now it's more effective to fly a drone over as an example. Yemen, I have no idea if that's happening, but it's easier to have a drone over Yemen than an aircraft carrier sitting off the coast to do something about it. So now we have a an enemy that was in a couple of countries that's now in 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 countries and you can't really cut the head off of that snake anymore.

Speaker 2:          02:30:59       And I look at did I do anything that made my kids lives safer to do anything too major daughter's life safer? And I would say in the moment I feel I feel like I had a difference in the moment, but I think in the grand scale of thing, looking for things, looking back that everything that I was involved with, I almost think that the tide is washed it away and it's very frustrating because I was. I was only able to impact the battlespace that I was physically in. Right. But imagine if you weren't there. Well, so and so and I imagine for others like you weren't there. The role that we played I think is absolutely essential and looking back on my career, I think the role of what I did was to create space and a barrier and a boundary so people in this country can be complete cunts and complain about their rights and freedoms and oppression and inequality, all that stuff.

Speaker 2:          02:31:52       We have to create an environment where those things can thrive and flourish and be in a melting pot and figure out who we are so we have to have that role, but I just would frustrates me is seeing what's going on in the country or in seeing what's going on in the world and thinking that I was involved in something that was important, but just realizing all I was was a point in time is sticking my finger in the dam that had 15 different water spouts coming out of it. So you didn't have a total solution, but you certainly mitigated the problem. We admitted a good problem, only been in that moment in time and if you weren't there to mitigate it in that moment in time, who knows how much it could have escalated, who knows, but who knows if the time that I was there mitigated the problem or the football down the road and made it worse and it's a problem that your kids are mine are going to have to solve in the future and I don't know those answers.

Speaker 2:          02:32:39       I don't. I really. I was 100 percent and still am 100 percent committed and very proud of the actions that I took because at the end of the day I made the decisions of my actions. I got to where I'm super lucky and privileged where the American flag on my uniform and I got to be the example and the beacon of what I wanted the US to be. Every time that I got. I mean I've encountered people didn't know what the US was. They'd never seen an American before and how I acted was the u s to them. So I think it was important and I'm proud of those things, but I just hope at the end of the day I made a difference, you know, instead of trying to run up hill on a soft sand berm and go nowhere. Isn't that part of the problem with military action too? So you don't really know what the result is ultimately going to be.

Speaker 2:          02:33:18       I mean, everybody hopes in urine, you know, there's two sides, right? Correct. They both hope that they win. You don't really know what the fuck the results can be and it's not a difference in commitment on either one of those sides. People need to understand that as well too. It's not that I was more committed than the people that we were engaging with in with on a battlefield or anywhere in the world. It's a difference of opinion. They believe what they believe just as much as you and I believe what we believe, whatever the issue may be and who. I don't know. I'm not, I'm not. I can't say who's right. You know, I just did the best that I could do to try to fight for what it is that I believed in and I don't know, it's tough at the end of the day to sit back and think and be like, God damn it. What I do with my time. Yeah. It is a, it's a daunting feeling to think that there's never going to be a time where we really are a peace worldwide. I don't think we ever will be, but I also don't think we ever have been. No, I don't think we ever have been either. But do you think we ever would be. We were to, were attacked.

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       You remember that last, uh, one of the Reagan's speeches were talked about, uh, how quickly we would put our differences aside if we were attacked by an alien force from another world. I think it would change some things instead of

Speaker 2:          02:34:28       being local in San Diego and having or an la the flags up if the entire world was challenged with something that we had to come together with. I bet you that would be that feeling and it would cross probably any and all borders.

Speaker 3:          02:34:39       The UFO dorks though they grabbed that. They thought, oh my God, this is proof proof. Reagan knows Reagan knows, but I, I do feel like almost like what we were talking about with nine slash 11, right? Like that being attacked made people more, more acceptable to each other more. They felt more connected to each other. You know, let people in front of you on the highway, that kind of shit.

Speaker 2:          02:35:02       Hey, when you have your mortality in your life thrown in front of you, I think he creates a pallet that is much easier to appreciate the little things and I don't think most people experience that.

Speaker 3:          02:35:11       Is it weird for you when you spend so much time in combat and spend so much time overseas to come back and see all these people that really don't know the darkest side of the world currently mean people have a view of what the earth is in 2017 and if you live in San Francisco and all you do is, you know, you work at Silicon Valley and hanging out in the tech industry, you think that this is the world in 2017 because this is your world. This is zero insulated look like we were talking about. You don't really know the world until you go into the forest. You go into the forest, you go, oh, this is the world to the back. Country is still. The world is just, Oh, this is what it's really like when we don't have these artificial structures and when you spent so much time in combat and you come over and you see all these people that are fighting over these insignificant things and squabbling about the use of the preferred gender pronouns and all this crazy shit that people find significant today.

Speaker 2:          02:36:07       It is very challenging for me to listen to the things that people feel are important in the lack of. I would say it's the lack of what I would consider to be perspective and it's funny if you do say I did 17 years in the military. Let's say a guy does 20 years, you actually don't spend that much time in combat. Let's say you do a six month deployment, you're working even at every night of that six month deployment, which isn't gonna be the case, so every other night, so now you're working 90 days of that time. You might spend 30 minutes in combat in those 90 days, multiply that by five, six, seven, eight, nine deployments in 20 years. That's your total time combined in an actual combat environment. Not a theater of war, but a combat environment where you're directly involved in it, but that time period for me changes the way that I view the world.

Speaker 2:          02:37:02       Not only that time period, but just the time spent in those countries in seeing what's the standard in other countries and what's the standard here and when I hear, and again I think we talked about before, I, you know, people talk about inequality or oppression here in this country and I'll be the first to admit that there's inequality which is fun because there's inequality everywhere. But let's take a little bit of perspective here. If you are fortunate enough to wake up in the United States of America, the water that you sit down on the toilet over to take a shit is cleaner than most of the water people on Earth are going to have access to. You go to starbucks and you may pay more per ounce for a cup of coffee, for the fluid. Then you do the gas coming out of your pump going into your car that exceeds the annual income of most people on the face of the planet.

Speaker 2:          02:37:52       Are you living in a first world country where instead of spending your time trying to find that water, you get to spend your time sleeping in line in front of the apple store, waiting for the new iphone to come out, and then you have the balls to bitch about how bad you have it. That to me is a super tough pill to swallow because you want to talk about oppression and suppression of freedom of speech. I've seen street corners. They're still red from lopping dudes heads off because they voiced opinion that was counter to the opinion of the day. That will change your perspective on whether or not words hurt you and you know, what rights actually mean. And you'll be like, you know what? What you say is actually really offended. You know, it's offensive to me, but I'm glad we live in a place where you can say those things.

Speaker 2:          02:38:38       Moving on with my day. How much does that changed your perspective on human beings when you're in those environments? Uh, what you think a human being actually is? I have an inherent distrust of most of most human beings. If I'm being totally honest, I don't want to say that I'm antisocial. My wife would say that she probably wishes that I was more social, but I just kind of just take a step back and just try to avoid interactions with just about everybody that I encountered. While I would imagine that your spectrum is so much wider than the average person spectrum in terms of the atrocities that people are capable of committing, you've seen mean most of the time, right? You're operating in this one small little sort of village in the spectrum that most people are that are in civilization. You're in this one little tiny area, but you've seen the full thing.

Speaker 2:          02:39:22       I mean, you've seen horrible, horrible shit. Yeah. That's got to mean there's no way that wouldn't have some sort of no effect on how you would approach people. Like I said, I have to. It puts me in a position where I almost have to sit back and I have to bite my tongue because I don't share the opinions that most people share because if the military service that I have gave me anything, I think it gave me a different perspective on the world and it's only because I traveled to more of it than I think most people get the chance to do and I got to see more of it. Not Through my phone and my instagram screen, but through my own eyes and that all it really did is just changed my value perspective of life, of the little things. Uh, it, it just, it makes it, it makes it hard sometimes. It was there like a single or any significant moments that you can recall that shifted the way you

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       think about things. In what perspective? Just knowing the people capable of horrible shit.

Speaker 2:          02:40:25       I think the times they got me the most on that is where you would see adults talking kids into becoming suicide bombers. Just the evil, evil motherfucker who instead of having the stones to come and face you will go and try to talk some innocent kid and strapping on a suicide vest or a suicide belt and walk into a crowd and clack it off. I mean that. That is, to me the most insidious type of evil because

Speaker 2:          02:40:54       they're not willing to actually engage in themselves. They want to prey on victims and I, that's if I have anything I hate in the world, is that it's the victimization of innocent people watching that and seeing that that forever throws a different shade on your glasses for sure. Just knowing that people are capable of doing it. I am. I am not surprised by any behooven human behavior that I see, which doesn't necessarily make me any more prepared, but I also probably in the back of my head have a different thought process when I enter into situations. It's not like, oh, hey, everything's going to be great. Like I get my plan to kill everybody first and then I relax a little bit.

Speaker 1:          02:41:28       Yeah. Who, who, uh, who said that? Tim Kennedy. Yeah. Have have a plan to kill everybody in the room, but. And that's the thing, and it was it mcmaster's. It might've been, yeah, it would be a be friendly, be courteous, but have a plan to kill everybody in the room and if you're around human behavior that would put people on their heels

Speaker 2:          02:41:51       and turn them white in the face long enough, that is going to become your default position. Whether or not you want it to be or not. I'm not in a violent person. I'm probably the last person you could draw into violence, but I'm not also surprised by violence and I'll react to it accordingly if I encounter it because it doesn't surprise me.

Speaker 1:          02:42:07       Right. So yeah, I would just think that. I mean, I've just got to believe that a person like you that has experienced that insane level of cruelty and evil, that your view of the world, that you would be really intolerant to people that do have this sort of narrow minded view of what the United States is and our, our role in the world and how the rest of the world views us and who the rest of the world is and I'm incredibly appreciative that they live in

Speaker 2:          02:42:38       place that provides an environment for them that they can have that narrow minded view. I'd rather them be that than have that place not exist. You can be the biggest asshole you want to and I'm going to sit back and be grateful that, that place on earth

Speaker 1:          02:42:53       for you to be like that. You know, and I understand the idea of the non interventionist foreign policy that if you know, we'd never were in these places, we would never have issues and I just, just 100 percent false. This is just another way to look at yourself as a victim. Is it? I think so. In my opinion. Yes you can. It's easier to blow, well if we didn't do this

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       then they wouldn't do that. No. How about real evil does exist and there are always going to be people who want to do something about that. Regardless. If you're a pacifist, you're a Catholic, fill in the blank, you will have your access somewhere on earth and they're coming for you. Well, it's also those parts of the world in particular are so ancient and people have been living there for so long. I believe that they have the echoes of the past and them so deeply embedded in their culture and their actions. I mean you're, you're talking about parts of the world that really. They've had people living there for five, 6,000 years and the, the ancient barbaric instincts of those people just have got to be those. Those echoes have got to be sort of reverberating through those cultures. Some of them are very interesting. I think one of the biggest difference differences that I saw between Iraq and Afghanistan and the United States and you know a couple actually no def, definitely those two countries in the Middle East is that there's just a different appreciation for life.

Speaker 2:          02:44:14       They, there's less of a value of life because I think they almost find or expect that it's going to just end sooner. It's very, very different culturally and yeah, I don't know. I don't know if that oil in water will mix or if ever can mix or we need to have a third party that acts as something in between that allows us to gel or man, I don't know, it's. I don't have a solution for it, that's for sure. And when you look at like how long there has been conflict in the Middle East, it almost seems like an insurmountable issue. There's been conflict with man since the history of man, right? I mean, and so I say I think we're in a forever war right now. We probably were in a forever war before it just. I think the face of warfare has changed along the way and the access to information about that has drastically increased, was changes people's perception about it, right.

Speaker 2:          02:45:03       Like we're always involved in some sort of a conflict, but we think of as a war is when we have our troops over there are citizens over there and listed. Then we said, okay, well now we're actually at war. Yeah. Yeah. And this war especially what's going on in Afghanistan. It's been going on for so long, you know, coming up on 17 years. That's so crazy. Yup. And what's happening over there? I mean, what are we accomplishing? A. I don't have a complete answer for that in my opinion. I would say that they are trying to do their best to stabilize that region of the world by supporting the government would be my best. Chuck just murderous, murderous in the sense of not being able to describe it properly, explanation of what's going on. Man and Iraq is the same way. Don't think for a second that we ever had boots off of the ground in Iraq.

Speaker 2:          02:45:55       It's just talked about a lot less. We still have a presence there that people don't understand. We still have a presence in Korea. We still have a presence in Europe. That's how long you have to stay if you're willing to invest the time for stabilization, which the US military I would argue is not very good at those types of operations. You can do it, but you could also probably do open heart surgery with a shovel to it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be the cleanest. So you should probably have a military and then you should probably have some sort of fix up crew. Yeah. Uh, I mean I think they try to do that with all the, uh, non government organizations or other government organizations. I just think it's really difficult. And in you know, in the Middle East, like you said, you're talking about people who have been there for five and 6,000 years, this 17 years that we've had a presence there and they're like, talk to me later sun when it's at 1700.

Speaker 2:          02:46:47       I don't know how the solution for it at all. I mean, it's, these are the things I think about. The solution might be moved to a town of 22,000 people here. God Damn Right. It is. It might be just disengage. I do better somebody enjoy your time. I do better with it there, but I mean it's, I'd spend an inordinate time amount of time thinking about that stuff, trying to make sense of that, that amount of time in my life. How could you not? It's 20 years of your existence on planet earth almost. Damn, that's a lot of time. Nope. And it probably would have been more if you didn't get shot. Well actually nursed it out for eight more years after I got shot. I did another deployment after I got shot, which was probably not the best call, uh, because I had some residual effects from it and almost gotten to the point where it's like, okay, I need to call a helicopter in and come pick me up because I'm, I'm inhibiting the other people that I was with.

Speaker 2:          02:47:39       Wow. I didn't want to be done. I mean I got shot. I got shot in 2005, so I was 27 super, super young in comparison to where I am now at a place I wanted to be operating at a level that I wanted to be operating at and then, you know, I'm in an Indycar, do an 800 around the track and it's like, oops, just put it in reverse by accident. There goes the tranny down on the track and just to try to rebuild that. And it took awhile. But yeah, I ended up strapped it on one more time and then at the end of that it was like, okay, I can't do it. Why did you want to go back? Like, what was what. I mean this was something that Sebastian younger talked about a lot in tribe. I think for me it was more I needed to.

Speaker 2:          02:48:21       I needed to do it for myself. Uh, when I got shot, it scared the shit out of me. You know, there's a lot of, there's a lot of times in the movies, there's this just blind heroism and it doesn't matter what's going on and you're like, oh, I'm just going to run through the hail of bullets. Well, I was flat on my back and but when the round hit me in my hip and by the time I had hit the ground, my first thought in my head was that my femur had just been shattered and I was going to bleed to death in the space of your hamstring and your quality, you can fit your entire blood volume there like I'll be dead in about a minute. That's what I was thinking in my head before I hit the ground. And then what ended up happening that night happened.

Speaker 2:          02:48:58       Eight people ended up getting wounded. I was one of the least wounded people. So they were flying people out on helicopters. I got put into a Bradley fighting vehicle and taken to the Green Zone in Iraq. But it scared the crap out of me. And not only did it scare the crap out of me, it absolutely crushed my confidence in my ability to do my job, which up until that point, I thought that I was at the very least competent and capable of doing my job and I had everything was going great up until that moment and then it and then it didn't and I had nothing but questions and avoid that I had to pull myself out of and it was probably very selfish in my desire to go back and my desire to continue doing what I was doing, but I had to build myself back up to a point where I thought I could operate again. And I remember very distinctly going back to Afghanistan in 2010 in standing outside the door, getting ready to go into a door on a house, thinking in my head, do you still have it? And then going into the door and I, I needed for myself to do that again too. I guess regained for me a sense of who I was and to regain my confidence. Wow.

Speaker 2:          02:50:11       What did, what did you fear would happen? If you didn't do that, I feared that I wouldn't know who I was because when I was younger, I'll be the first to admit that I believe I put too much weight into what I did as opposed to who I was.

Speaker 2:          02:50:28       I had too much attached to being a seal. It was, and I, I, and I again, in my opinion, the problem that I see with people that struggle when they get out of the military is if they attach too much of their identity to an occupation that they've walked away from, they really struggle most times. Not Always, but most times, and those people can end up getting themselves into some pretty bad positions. And when for guys who cut out from that career, when they go off the rails, fuck me Nag, go off the rails in a big way because we have two speeds. We have fifth gear and hold my beer. That's the only two speeds that we have. Yeah, and I thought I had lost that and I, I was at a point in my life where, like I said, I was where I wanted to be doing what I was wanting to do.

Speaker 2:          02:51:11       I thought I was doing it right and I mean it. I thought I was going to die in 36 hours after getting shot. I got off the stairs of an airplane in Virginia beach and my wife had my son in a stroller and was pregnant with my second, my middle son. It just was such a bizarre series of events that happened so quickly and I went from going so fast to nowhere, to having nothing to do, to not understanding why I couldn't train my body to get back to where I was because the only job I'd had in my adult life other than working for my father, I had too much. I had too much invested in that occupational title and I think one of the best things that I was able to do in my military career was to survive it and get out and to move on.

Speaker 2:          02:51:53       That's one of the hardest things for fighters as well. It's a big thing with them and may fighters boxers too. They just don't know what to do when it's over. They have. They become these incredible winners in this one avenue and then once that's done, they rarely achieved that same kind of success in anything else where they're probably not thinking about anything else when they're in the middle of fighting, which is very common with people in military too, right? Because the job does require a very focused, myopic sense of drive. This is what you need to do, especially in the seal teams. It's the team comes first, team gear, personal gear. Then take care of yourself, worried more about the person to your left and to the right and then worry about yourself, you know, consider the impacts of your actions and your words on the people around you and then on yourself.

Speaker 2:          02:52:38       So it's very. It is very driven down into a laser like focus, but that's also required to survive and thrive in those environments. But if left unchecked, you'll end up at the end of your career not prepared for the next phase of your life and say you do 20 years in the military, which is what you need to do to get a retirement. You joined when you're 18, so hey, you're 38. Well, the average lifespan of American is what? 80, 85. You got a lot of time left. What are you going to do? And if you haven't thought about it, it's, it's it. As see guys who struggle. I see guys and I struggled myself, but I, I think I, I think I went through that struggle while I was still in and I think that struggle allow me to lift my chin up just a little bit to look around and start thinking about the future. You're a bad motherfucker and just dump. Let's wrap this up. I don't know about that, but let's wrap this up right there. Cool. Thanks brother. Appreciate you man. All Right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back tomorrow. See Ya.
