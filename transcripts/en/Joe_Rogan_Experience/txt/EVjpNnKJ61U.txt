Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       Rogan experience day. Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

Speaker 2:          00:00:20       Brian, I want you to apologize. All the nice people out there in the world. I'm sorry I ever logged into the wrong use dream account and I guess the sound was too awesome. So the sound was too hot. Yeah. If I had to restart the computer and every time I restart the computer it always goes back to all the defaults for some reason. So like the sound is really hot and uh, my, my like login is saved in this, you stream. Thanks. So automatically I just pay it, you know, it screws everything up. So every time I've restarted I have to make sure everything is smoking weed before it totally. We have to, you know, we do, we need a little yellow checky checklist thing for you. Yeah. Can Channel you're on

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       the weed gets too much blame, you know what I mean? He gets it, right?

Speaker 2:          00:01:04       No, it does. It does. No, I mean like when I'm, when I'm doing stuff like you get stoned and you get, and everyone's like, all right, let's start now. Let's start now. And you're like, okay, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:01:13       and plan. I'm just fuck, when do you Dan? I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to a backup lead. You know what I mean? He gets a bad rap speaking and we, we got a, Tommy Chong is going to come on the podcast on Monday. It's fucking awesome. Yeah. That should be very fun. He a apparently is using that. Uh, Rick, you know that Rick Simpson thing, have you heard that the cannabis oil, there's some like some oil that you can make with cannabis. Yup. It's supposed to be super, super healthy for people who have a good friend. A good friend of mine came to La. He's, uh, he's from the east coast. He's got brain tumors in his head and he's supposed to die in six months. This was about a year ago and hardcore 10th planet is one of my top soldiers for sure. He a man. It's, it's weird because in the, in the position that we're in, we get a lot of people with, you know, there's a lot of people out there that have cancer that her fans as well.

Speaker 1:          00:02:09       You know what I mean? And when we're dealing with, you know, this is not an uncommon thing to have a student or someone come to me and have cancer, this happens all the time. People are like dying and it's crazy the spot that we're at. And we're like, fuck, well there's a gigantic amount of people in this country. You know, you're gonna run into some people that are sick and it's, it's, it's, um, it's very humbling. Well, this guy, he, you know, he started that cannabis oil therapy and his last checkup, the tumors stop. Not only did they stop growing, did they shrank like 40% and his doctors are like amazed at what's going on and he's on this cannabis oil therapy. It's becoming really popular now. You know, there's reports, I don't even think it makes you high, right? No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't make any money at all. So it's, it's not even an issue

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       of whether or not it's people are taking this and getting, getting high on it. The only way pockets your highs if you heat it up. I guess that's what's been explained to me. Like you can't just eat it, but when you eat it, if you just eat like the leaves, it's really healthy. They say like marijuana, like the flowers and the leaves are incredibly healthy for you. Like really it's great thing to juice. Like people should juice actual marijuana more popular announced yet. So I have a friend who who's at this, I dunno, his tumors are shrinking, which is crazy and doctors are baffled, but he's been on that, that cannabis therapy and it's working and it's, and it's becoming more and more popular and all these studies are coming up. Well, real legit scientific studies that have shown that marijuana shrinks tumors. It seems like every week or every other week there's this new study that comes out that proves that somehow marijuana can cure some kind of cancer.

Speaker 3:          00:03:56       Here are some kind of cancer there and it's, it's becoming so popular that I don't even retweet all of them. There's just too many damn studies. True. Am I going to ask my shit? There's just too many fucking studies, so I'm only re tweeting the juiciest he's, it's crazy. There's all this evidence, all this proof that marijuana is just wonder plan. It's not just an ordinary plan. It's not just a plant. It's like an Italian magical plant. There's all this proof and people still deny it. It's still a schedule one drug and crazy as that coke and heroin are scheduled to cause they have medicinal use supposedly. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah, it's completely ridiculous. How about that video of that one congressman grilling that chick from the d and check his mom. Really? She deflected everything beautifully. Oh my God. You know, all illegal drugs are dangerous. They're a bi woman. All illegal drugs are bad.

Speaker 3:          00:04:55       You know the DA's watching like in a dark room, laughing their asses off gone. That was brilliant. You know, she got like a fucking $500,000 bonus and shit for that. Really? I thought she was terrible. She looked brilliant. Well, nothing's going to happen from it. They just needed someone to go out there and Jibber Jabber and just get past it and whatever and then they don't give a fuck. They got an old lady, they got an old lady. So it's easy for a guy. If you don't think that, think too deeply about it. You're like, here's how could I be against an old lady who's trying to keep us off drugs? You know what I mean? An old lady trying to keep us off drugs. So a lot of people with the shooting. How old was she? She, she looks like 36 or 40 she's like 60 [inaudible]. Yeah, she was all, they got an old lady up there and see all I got out of that, that was that. She was joyless. I didn't get her age. I got just as joyless woman perf out there working. Brilliant. Just the best old lady come out and just say whatever. They're like laughing in the back room cause you don't really, they don't really, they're not really accountable and nothing really is going to do that. Yeah. Do you think like they don't know all the truth and shit. They know what they're trying

Speaker 4:          00:05:57       to suppress it. So how do you suppress it? Fuck where they want to grill someone in the DA. I'm not going. You Go. No, I'm not going in any fucking make the secretary go out there. I'm sort of million dollars. Just say, just say drugs are bad. Just see trucks are bad and it worked because it's on video and it's not going to change shit. And it was like, you know, she tried to um, you know, different addictive properties. All drugs are bad, drugs are illegal. Is Marijuana more addictive than heroin? Um, I don't, uh, they're both illegal and both of what is more, more addictive, marijuana or heroin, which in your opinion is more addictive but both have addictive properties. Both are illegal and you choose a or B. Yes, exactly. But it's like jeopardy on Saturday and you are an expert on this. You should know this.

Speaker 4:          00:06:46       Is Marijuana more dangerous then pills and prescription pills. All drugs are illegal. All drug. She was brilliant. It was perfect. It's so weird. It's so represents like if it was a movie and this was like the frustrating point in the movie where people were starting to get all the information and started to realize that this, the structure that they've got set up, it just, you don't have to live this way. We just lived this way because it's been set up for us before we had any information on how things are really going on behind the scenes and then you, you see something like this, I mean this is, this is the thing that would make people rise up if that was really the drug enforcement agency that was really their attitude. That's really their take on it. That's really a spokesperson for this. Like what are you doing?

Speaker 4:          00:07:31       Yeah, watch that video. It's congressman grills d a agent or something. So hilarious. It's talking about like fucking prescription pills. They're talking about abusive prescription pills, but you know what? They're not talking about stopping those prescription pills were being made. Someone's always going to get them, so it's always going to have a backend because someone's always going to happen. You can't stop. You can't stop prescription pills. And make prescription pills. You can't do both, you know, so you never going to stop them. That's horse shit. So when they say that they're, they're, they're looking to cut down on illegal prescription drugs. Like what ever, what, what, uh, what kind of a fucking smoke screen is that? How much money is that even? How much money is it compared to the legal ones, the people who are legally selling the exact same shit, but because the doctor says it's cool to take oxycontin every day for the rest of your fucking life.

Speaker 4:          00:08:20       You're down in there. Next thing you know, Whoa, you're a junkie. That's legal though. That's illegal. But marijuana, you can't grow. You can't eat this incredible plant. Even if you were completely uninterested in getting high, if you just said, the nutrition of this plant is unquestionable. If you look at the amino acid profile, if you look at all the nutrients in it, look at the fibrin. It's an incredible super food. It's better than Kale. It's like, but it's so expensive. You could never eat it because it's illegal. But if it was legal, it'd be cheaper than fucking Kale. That would be a real problem. I know a bunch

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       of people that lived in northern California that prosper off of the illegality of it that were arguing, they were going to vote against it. If it came on the ballot. They're like, we make more money. If it's illegal. They were, they were ready to go gangster. They would rather go gangster and then make it a little bit of extra money then have it like that's like contrary to the whole idea behind weed in the first put money takes precedent. Yeah. It's amazing. It's amazing how strong the pole is in, in some circumstances over like what would be good for humanity. You know, man, fuck it. I go to the TV are going to pay for, you know, could you imagine that some assholes grow and he's like organizing people to try to stop the, the, uh, initiatives to make it legal. Fuck. Keep it illegal, dude. Keep it illegal. Just you and me and bro worked together. I'll get you the weed. You give me the cash. Selfish bitches. So can imagine. So how self hating would you have to be to be a pothead who grows weed and you vote against it being legal fucking piece of shit. You fucking dummy. That's some silly bitches.

Speaker 2:          00:10:07       Don't say Spiderman. The, I won't see Spiderman. We talked about this earlier before we, uh, were brought to the wrong channel. Tobey Maguire is a way better. Spiderman's funny. Yeah, the new one's not, it seems cold. You can't keep rebooting shit man. So I think they should repeat it one more time and then just get that last one and just make it Toby back and make it not explain to me what the coolest part was. It's like they use slow motion a lot, kind of like matrix stuff. They used it a couple of times and it was really beautiful. So I think they should slow down the movie, make it slow. But Tobey Maguire doing jokes, dude, I thought I told him McGuire was awesome. Batman. I thought it was perfect. Spiderman, Spiderman, Batman. He, he like was a perfect Peter Parker. Yeah. Perfect. Perfect. It's exactly what I imagined when I was reading a comic book where this guy seems like, um, twilight, Spiderman and I got emotions, I get bruised and scratched you bitch.

Speaker 2:          00:11:02       And then there was some really cool scenes where they tried to do like, like a, like if you were the person like you know, like a spoiler in right now. Not, not at all. I'm not giving away any plot. This is like more effects and stuff, but there's probably like first person shooter style, like where they just failed at it. Like it's like, you know how like in a video game where that you will see the arms calm and got, it was a three D it was three d imax and it was just like these little hands going like here in the corner or something. I'm like, no, it's not, you're not doing it right like it. So you want it like a full arm slowed it down. Like, like if you were first person move while he's swinging, you know, made it look super cool.

Speaker 2:          00:11:36       I think that would be way better than then. I don't know. It just Spiderman by the way is way more bad ass and an actual spider. If a spider, it was the size of Spiderman, he wouldn't be able to fucking shoot webs that far. And they hold themselves explaining the technology this time I behind it. I don't know if I like that. And uh, also they uh, they redid the whole uncle Ben things. Do you the whole time you're like, you don't have care cause you know what's going to happen to him. He saw how it was going to happen in the previous thing. It's like before it used to be in a comic book, you know, it wasn't translated in person. In a movie, you get to see it again. I had to see it kind of again and they changed it a little.

Speaker 2:          00:12:16       Yeah. That is kind of wag right down in a movie. Like Mary Jane wasn't around and it kind of freaked me out, but she would, oh Mary Jane at all. No, Mary Jane bugged the hell out of me, sons of bitches and I don't know, man. It was, it was fun, but it kind of bummed me out. It just didn't feel like Spiderman at all. There was no humor in the whole thing and Spiderman is a comic book was was humorous and your Bravo, bravo hates like superhero movies. The only superhero I like is flash. There's a kick ass. There was never a big flash movie was there. I'll go see that. That's it. Other than that, did you see kick ass? I like that. Yeah. That's kind of cool. You just don't like like stupid shit like Captain America flying around and shield and stuff. I know most people like that shit obviously cause they fucking come out with three of them every year.

Speaker 2:          00:13:06       I know most people like that shit. I'm in that small minority that I wish I fucking like. I wish there was, I wish every time a fucking new Batman came out I got [inaudible] do fucking anything. That's crazy. That'd be bad man. It looks fucking shit myself crazy. I was not a DC guy when I was growing up was a marvel guy. There's something about that. I feel like I'm still prejudice against Batman or something because I don't really care about it as much as like the Avengers is fucking pumped, man salmon and that that movie delivered. Did you like the Avengers? How dare you Eddie Bravo. How everybody liked it do just for the hulk alone. It's awesome. The Hawk is amazing. Greatest Song of all time. They'd nailed it. It's like days used to do the whole kit. It was like, you know, first he did Lou Ferrigno.

Speaker 2:          00:13:56       He did a great job for a person. I mean, if you're going to get a person to play the hook, that's the perfect got right. Giant fucking knew, but he was never anything like the hulk in the comic books. The hulk in the comic books was not a man. It was just fucking freak. This crazy big freak thing that it's so fun to watch when he gets mad. When the hulk gets mad, you think about God damn, could you manage if you could do with that guy he do. He can fight anything. The hulk is unafraid of anything. He smashes everything in front of. He smashes. He smashes gods. He grabbed a god and smashed him. Just smashed them all over the grounds. The fucking rubbles breaking up. You have to like smashing Eddie. When you watch it, it's still give it a chance. I'll give a, the hulk alone is so fun. I'll give it a chance. He fucking goes after a jet, like a Jenny shooting missiles, Adam and he gets fucking mad. Goes after the jet. I mean it's to be, the hulk would have to be like if you had to, if there was like one

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       thing you could do, if you could like, if they could give you like some sort of a neural implant, you know, what does the movie total recall type experience where they simulate a reality for you and you get a chance to try it. Like what would you like to do? I would like it'd be the hulk. Can it be the hulk in an artificial reality for just one hour? You know how fucking bad ass that would be. You can fly, you can jump and fly through the air. Bullets bounce right off you like nothing. You could smash. I would want to be seeing a pissed off mood all the time, but you would only be fighting bad guys miraculously. The Hug. Never heard any good guys. Direct answers. Spiderwoman now you have the same power as Spiderman, but she's a woman. She's got boobs and a vagina.

Speaker 4:          00:15:31       So for one hour you get to be Spiderwoman. Plus you can play with your boot boots and vagina for an hour. That's the best way. And it's going to be a woman you'd rather smashed in and do that. Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah, because a lot of spiders, when you fuck the, the female, the female kills the mail. That shit happens all the time and we kill some dudes. Fingers open, swing around New York, some bs apparently when the orgasm die too. Did you know that really? Some fucking beast. Certain beans, like when they orgasming or take explodes and they die, the nature has a way of making sure there's not an overflow. Making sure that, you know, we've got to even out this population thing and the female spider does not trust that male motherfucker. So after he impregnates her, she's like, yeah, I'm done with you.

Speaker 4:          00:16:18       And she did Jackson, which is really kind of fucked up, but probably a good idea. I mean, if she loves her babies and she's going to have babies, you're going to trust all 1000 of her babies with this canteen, male spider around. He might just eat the babies if he's fucking hungry, you know? She's like, I can't take that chance. I just got to jack him socially Jackson, I guess I was wrong about Spiderman. I guess the amazing Spiderman was a different storyline then I guess one of the other spider. So the comment at the amazing Spiderman, the only main one, like the w rights where like Peter Parker and the amazing Spiderman or, oh, I don't know. I mean nerdy to me the fuck out like a web of Spiderman. I don't even know. So now I'm really confused. So sorry, nerds. I fucked up.

Speaker 4:          00:17:02       I fucked up. I remember Mary Jane Doe Being Fault though. They can't be changing plots like this. Amazing Spiderman was Mary Jane. I think up a new superhero bitch. All right. You have to keep changing. Don't change Spiderman. Right? Fuck. He probably doesn't give a shit. He would get mad. We would go to movies like, well, I know this guy's going to live. He always would get upset. You can never just enjoy it. It was like, this is so stupid. They're mad ass, man. I, there's some, there's something about movies that I could figure out if I could figure it out. I hate it if it has me on my toes and it's totally unpredictable and as a really good storyline obviously. But that's what I'm into. I like, I like not knowing, that's what gets me excited, knowing what's going to happen. You know, all that money that I'll, that CGI it takes for you up for Batman to be, he's like in seven fights per

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       movie, seven big episodes where he almost dies, right? He's a, he's fighting all the shit, all that work that's so expensive. And so, granted, it looks so beautiful and for me, um, minority, that doesn't mean anything for me. It doesn't do shit and grow up block plane watching cartoons much studio or like any of that stuff. I wasn't in the comments because I watch cartoons. I watched the Super Heroes, I guess the super friends and I was like eight, you know. But did you like star wars growing up? And I did like star wars growing up. Did you enjoy Avatar? I like to have a time. Okay. But that was a super predictable movie, man. That was a complete comic book. Movie Avatar was the ultimate, um, like pre determined, like predetermined, ending moving. No, a superhero movie is the most that's like, you know, Spiderman is gonna live, you know, it's going to be the Avatar dude was going to live.

Speaker 1:          00:18:41       He lived through the whole thing. He became a fucking one of the member of the noble people himself. Avatar wasn't as predictable as Spiderman come on. No Way. Oh Dude. It's by no means the most predictable movie. Batman or Superman, all that shits the same thing. But this movie is predictable too because the guy, I mean w w not even predictable because I don't think that, I shouldn't even say predictable. What I should say is it follows like a pretty obvious pattern. It follows a pattern with a purpose person that you're focusing on in the beginning is probably going to be alive at the end. Like 99.999% of the time. Yes, but it's not as clear as a superhero movie that's called Spiderman. You know, Avatar wasn't a person of Avatar was like a chick. You knew that or up dude or something like Avatar, the fighter and he's going to follow it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:27       I see what you're saying. It's because it's a science fiction movie. You don't consider it a comic. It's Vince. I worship Tara. I'm not trying to watch it back on. It's good. I know what you're saying. It is. It's, it's less ridiculous than a Batman. There's different levels. When I say it's a comic book movie, I say that with a compliment because I loved that movie. I thought most people do know. Most people love that shit. You know? I just, I just can't feel it. But you felt avatar and I'm saying that Avatar, he is very much like, in a lot of ways it's like a comic book. It's not like a superhero movie. That's what I meant. I meant like a superhero comic hero. Like, like my name is Avatar. I'm going to save this alien planet. Did you watch that shit? Did you enjoy like Clint Eastwood movies? Like those half humor movies, like every which way, but loose now really told them tool around.

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       I don't know. Do you remember him? He eight. I barely remember. I did see Bj and the bear and Bj and the bear. I mean, I was into that shit. Isn't it weird now that we know so much about chimpanzees, like something that kid that's student in Africa just got his fucking testicle ripped off, his fingers bitten off. They dragged them for like two kilometers or something like that. I mean, he's really scary shit and they beat the fuck out of this kid now that you know so much about chimps is really a hard to watch. Like Bj and the bear.

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       And this dude's like tooling around with a chimp. It's not even really a chip. It's a baby. It's a little baby chimp. It's like a little three year old or something like that. Like, cause that's about as old as you can get before you got to circle out that Bj and bringing in a new Bj or bringing a new bear or whatever the fuck his name is. You can't have that. He can't grow up. Cause if he grows up, he's going to fucking drive. You know? Imagine sitting in the cab of a truck with a giant male chimpanzee and he's like, how about I just fucking drive right now? Just grabs that wheel from you. What are you going to do?

Speaker 3:          00:21:20       It's going to bite your fucking nose off. Brian, some due to work at a zoo, brought home a baby chimp because her mom has the baby, the chimps mother died. And at that same time she had the person that worked at the zoo have this dog that just had puppies, had four puppies, like this big massive. And she brought that fucking chimp home. And that massive took in that champion as a child of its own. Oh, I got all these pictures of it. It's incredible. They're like all hanging out. It's like a little baby chimp. Holy Shit. You know what I'll do? I'll tweet it to you. You'd be able to see it there? Yeah, I could tweet it. Would you rather be she hawk? What's that like? She Hawker halt for an hour. She hulk or Hawk for an hour. Is there a she hulk? Yeah, it does. That's a strong,

Speaker 2:          00:22:05       maybe not his check dude. Why do you keep trying to turn yourself into a check? Because I mean if you could have a vagina for an hour, just don't. You'd rather be the lingering stores. The Gorney weaver. Did you look the Harris so you really get seriously, are you serious? You really want at the time and one hour, it could be for one hour to be Spiderman or spider woman where she hawker, she earned made a fire and so you could feel what it feels like to get clocks go, didn't know what it feels. A robot from the towns. You're curious about that. It doesn't have to be a fantasy to just use your battles, have boobs and hold one hour besides no period. No period. This is fresh, fresh as big come for one hour, one hour dude, you would get bored. You would want to start using it. You'll be out on the street going, who wants a fuck? I've got 40 minutes left as a woman. Yeah. But if you're super woman, imagine flying around like on top of like the earth and just go and look how beautiful it is and then start fingering your pussy and sucking on your own tissue. Maybe it was weird. Why did you're doing, maybe it will stain your, your

Speaker 4:          00:23:07       brain and then when you come back to being a man again, it's imprinted in your memory now you'd just become gay. Maybe. Was there a story about a dude who got in some sort of an accident and then became gay? It was like, uh, yeah. I think like rugby player cause he's looked at the pictures of him before. He was like sucking dicks and stuff like that. I mean he just had like really? He looked gay. So you think it was just a good excuse? Yeah, like you realize, hey, life is short. Maybe. Why don't I just say that I just got knocked gay. I don't know. Oh yeah. I just think if you're going to do it for an hour and you can get to fly around and look at nature. When I told finger yourself, okay, well I could see your logic. You've really wouldn't do it for

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       an hour. No, I'm not really into being a chick at all for an hour. What if it starts to try? You will never be convinced that you can fuck what you're saying right now. Shit, that's deep shit. What you're saying, this is millions of people or one hour. You have to deny that Shit Brian, to do this is like a mood from the eighth to buy it. Deny it. Say that. You're just trying to be funny right now. No, I think say the hour. It would be kind of fun. You're curious to see how it would be to get rail. You could make that happen. You don't have to it, you could actually make that happen. I'm just saying man, like most drugs, I'll try it once.

Speaker 4:          00:24:21       Wow. But not facts or anything like that except for a woman. No, no, no, no. I'm saying if I could be spider woman or spider man, might as well be spider one me. Cause you have boobs and a vagina. I'm not saying, I'm not saying it like, Hey, I want to have a sex change. I know to thinking, well why not? If you're going to go all out, if I was 12 and I lived in the eighties I probably would agree with you. Right? I'm going to say no. I feel creepy. Listen man, it's still saying, even contemplated the thought. I mean it's a funny thing for men, but even contemplated the thought of what it would be like to have, you know, to switch places and to be a woman, you know, just what would it be like if you were born? I will never thought it ever and I've never wanted to be a woman to, but if I had to choose between spider woman and spider man, I think I might go with this.

Speaker 4:          00:25:14       You're saying, I understand what you're saying, but I'm saying it's a funny thing that people get really uncomfortable about the idea of even pretending that you're a woman, like or allowing yourself to even think what would life be like as a woman like matter? Like what are you doing? What are you doing over there? You know, like it's a, it's a legitimate thought. I mean there's only two sexes. Okay. One's male, one's female. If you happen to be male and heterosexual, how much do you understand about what it's like to be a female heterosexual? Do you really understand it? No. You'll know you're standing your side of it. What would you, uh, you know, there was like a little thing, like a little chip, like total recall style and you can be a woman having sex and you can experience what it feels like to be a woman having sex with a man.

Speaker 4:          00:26:00       Would you do it or would that make him gay? I'd be super woman would flight the Eiffel Tower and just going, what would be some shit the girls would find out and they'd be like, really creeped out about you. You're like, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You did at all the things you could do with total recall. You went and you were a woman getting fucked by a guy. Is that what you're telling me? Well, I'm just, you know, it's not a gay thing at all. I just wanted to understand the experience. Wait a minute, wait a minute. You could have done anything and all that money and you decided to be a girl getting fucked by a guy. Well, you know, I mean I don't think of it that way. I think of it as like, you know, experiencing something new. Otherwise it'd be like completely out of my reach.

Speaker 4:          00:26:42       It like there's a joke coming. You know what I mean? It does. It sounds like that. It's like one a year, early, two thousands you're talking to some chick on the phone. Wait a minute. You mean to tell me girls would not be happy with that? I wouldn't be happy if I was a chick and I found out a dude pretended to be a girl and got fucked by cock and be like, Whoa, how much that stays in your head, how much that stays in your head, how much is the pleasure of caulk that you enjoyed so much as a woman for that, you know, whatever amount of time. How much of that is in your memories still? Did you love the cock during that time? Okay, well cause then you still love the cock. They could turn the gay fuck around. I'm just saying, we're not saying you're getting fucking happened.

Speaker 4:          00:27:20       I'm talking in comic book in the future. That's probably what game's all about. It's just some new evolutionary exchange so that we can, uh, have like less people. What I think is gay or, and this has been happening a lot on the ice house, chronicles his other comics. I think it's happened twice now saying if they were in a steam room and a Brad Pitt or George Clooney walked in, would they totally fuck them? And I think Burt Chrysler said yes. Bert Kreischer said he would fuck there was somebody else. I can't cry. She was just being funny. No, but they were all being serious. I don't know if it was Bert Kreischer at night. Somebody tweet me if they can remind me. You're saying you don't know if it's him. That's a serious, it was, I think it was rob Lowe was correct. It's a serious allegation. You better know that name is correct.

Speaker 4:          00:28:03       But that's been happening. That's been happening a lot lately. And I'm like, why would you want to do it? He's like, dude, I think same AAA, maybe awesome. But it was like, dude, it's fucking Brad Pitt. But yeah, but you know, you know that this is all just for humor. You can't pretend these are real conversations. You're average. That's what I said. You're just kidding. And they're like, we're done. Stand up. Comedians don't, they're going for the joke. Yeah. Okay. So whether or not, Bro, I don't know whether or not Bert would actually look. Burt, my, that Tom Cruise, fuck him. Just for the story. If he, Tom Cruise had a moderate to small size dick and uh, and he wore a condom and Burton didn't have to kiss him, Burt might do it just for the story because where does the greatest stories in the history of the world and you don't, you don't have those stories without taking some chances.

Speaker 4:          00:28:52       I don't know. But he might be willing to do it just for the store. Most likely I'd say no, just fuck. Is that going to get an and Harrison Burg crisis? The fucking man, it's the funniest guy of all time. He's right up there with Joey d as far as like, like ridiculous, natural humor. He just so, just such a silly guy. He's so fun. You know, it's such a great guy to have around, you know, so that the last podcast, it was all fun. Cruising can fuck him. Probably just getting the last part of the house was all fucked up. It's in two parts. You know, we had the Josh Barnett one you're talking about. Yeah, we had, it's like a power thing where I got electrocuted and shit. Yeah. We have the ice house unfortunately had a little issue with their electrical system that led to Brian getting electrocuted in his fucking face. Yeah. And so, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       so that night I had took a, after you left, after that podcast I took apart the whole entire studio. Courtney came over and we like went through and throw away all this stuff. I went through every wire to make sure it wasn't on my side and I put it back together and we had another podcast, the bone zone. And right before the podcast started, uh, some somebody put in between the alley of the studio and the other building, I think it was somebody who said it was like an m 100 or something like that, which is like a quarter stick of dynamite. And uh, it's a firework but it went lit it, but it's super illegal and lit it. This, I dunno, like super loud. I was inside like plugging the outlet in after hooking up all the thing. And I put it in and I like stood up and it happened and I thought it was that, you know, cause I'm so I just got electrocuted and so, but I filled out all my face, my face like when like, like lobby, like the impact and someone threw a bomb at you pretty much, but they were doing it in between cause like, uh, cause there was a comedy show coming and coming out and some, you know, do just threw it on the ground or something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:30:45       But where did it go? Did it go inside the room? No, no, no, no. Outside the room. Right by. Right outside the room in that alley. So it was in a conf confined place cause to alley. There's that space. Yeah. And it was, yeah, man. Fireworks or a fucking ridiculous. In California. It's so God damn dry. I know. People are shooting shit up in the air all day. See what the fuck is going on in Colorado, man, you know, there's this huge wildfire. They think part of it was started, one of the rumors that some kids were shooting at things right there were fucking around with guns and they hit a rock or something like that. It causes a spark and that was it. That's all she wrote. So I shit myself, we all ran outside smoke everywhere. People freaking out. I thought the building was blowing up.

Speaker 2:          00:31:26       Like I thought that the electric thing, you know, and all those like, like something is not right. Uh, and you know, freaked out. Anyways, we did the podcast. All this shit happened, uh, after the podcast, I'm driving home a good to the stoplight and I was about to go to the gas station, but I was like, no, I'm going to stay. And it's black dude starts walking up to me holding two car stereos and like something else, some other box, like a camera camcorder box or something like that. He got and he stops. He starts screaming at me and I turn up, my stereo was a little bit, and then I, I tried to roll up my window, but my window, it's fucked up. Like it's like some setting where I hit it and it will like roll up halfway and then roll all the way down.

Speaker 2:          00:32:07       I'm like, it's been a hit it again and it rolls up like only a little bit and then it rolls down. I'm like, fuck, I'm just going to keep it down. The Guy starts screaming and I'm just kind of ignoring them and finally unlike in the corner of my eye, I'm like, all right, this dude's still staring at me and screaming at me, so I better look at them. So look at him. He goes, give me a fucking cigarette. And I'm like, oh, all right. He goes and he goes and he goes through it on the mother fucking crowd. I'm like, what? He goes, I'll go, I'll go to jail for you. I've got gun bitch. And I'm like, oh, okay. At through the cigarette on the ground. And he picks it up and he'd

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       just like stares at me for like a minute and people were honking their horns around because everyone else is seeing what's going on and he fucking starts acting like he's going to walk to me. Like walk towards my window. I'm the dude look fucking psycho. Like he looked crazy and then, uh, I just like the light turned green over like when I like took off turbos style in my car, but it was fucked up. That whole day was fucked up. That haunted house day. Yeah. That was a weird day. Josh Barnett was on the way up here from Orange County, got a blow out, barely controlled his car. He said it was trying to go into the dividing wall. You gotta hold it together, pull over to the side of the road. He got to get told it changes tired. Then he got to the podcast. By the time he got there, Brian had been electrocuted in the face.

Speaker 4:          00:33:21       Yeah. That's sucked. I did you hear it? Did you listen to her? I saw this almost like see like a little, there's a white park. Yeah. I was like, didn't really see that. They're really see that you saw it cause it was like, yeah, that's um, that's not good. Electrical Shit is fucking freaky. Scary as fuck. UHMM electrical fires, that kind of stuff too. We gotta be real careful when you get in sparks like that. Who knows what the fuck that's going to hit. You know, weird chicken happened when you got the storm. Just hit through Ohio and like most of Columbus doesn't have power race, a lot of the whole east coast. Yeah. Yeah. My Dad said that he won't have power till next Wednesday. Jesus Christ. So he has a generator just to do his refrigerator and his TV and fans. That's scary shit man.

Speaker 4:          00:34:09       It's like you have a generator. No, I need to get one on shit. It's scary to find out how easy it is for the power of wow. You know, it's scary number. When they were, there was some sort of scandal in the, in, in California and they were doing these brownouts whether it would just shut people's power off for a little while. I don't remember what the scandal was. It was, I don't remember what, but there had been, they had been shown that there was some collusion involved in shutting people's power off. I don't know the exact story. I'm totally butchering it. But uh, I remember thinking that like that was a scary thing man, when that was going on, when they would just shut the power off in certain spots, you know, that's not, wait a minute, you guys can't keep the fucking power on all the time.

Speaker 4:          00:34:49       What are we doing that's really fucking scary. Yeah, it is scary. It gets scary. Like how much power do we have? We use it all up like what's going on here? That wizard last night is the second time where I've been like, all right, this is getting really dangerous out here. You can, you never know man. When you, when you drive, you never know. It could zig when you should've zagged and all of sudden there's a crazy dude in front of you. You know when Justin Martin Dale fucking window fixed and Justin Martin, Martin Dale got recently robbed and stuff like that. Like a lot of people have been talking about it and a lot of bartenders in Hollywood have been getting robbed because they have money at the end of the night and they're leaving. So people are, these two guys are like targeting these guys and I guess from a friend of a friend, what they're saying is that it's a really, there's a really bad problem right now with people getting mugged and La and Hollywood, but they're not saying anything because they don't want it to, you know about a lot

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       of attention drawn to it. Right. But like it's really bad. A lot of people, well a lot of people are getting fucked. The economy's in the toilet man. More of a reason to do Jujitsu I guess. Gun You, yeah. You know what? I'm going to kill. You want to get in a gunfight? No, just we knew we need to figure out what the fuck the problem is. Our society is just, it's so funny how little we do like in terms of or literary require in terms of government and, and as far as like engineering our future as far as like, you know, figuring out a way to cut crime back. Looking at all the methods, superheroes, looking at no, talking about looking at different methods to rehabilitate people. It took a little bit of Ibogaine or Iowasca or you know, any, any fucking, anything that you could do that could help like rehabilitate kids once they get into trouble, once you realize that they're headed down a bad alley, you know, then we do like nothing for that.

Speaker 5:          00:36:34       It was, you know, very little consideration. It's not like something that's on the Internet every day. They're talking about all these kids that are growing up and shitty homes and what we need to do is figure out a way to provide some sort of guidance for a kid that doesn't get it from home. Some sort of a way to take advantage of all these young kids and give them something that no, no. Like isn't that what, like it should not be a part of what like the government is. It doesn't that make sense? I mean if you, if the you needed them for anything wouldn't need like they would, let's say we need to look at the future of our youth. This is a, this is the plan. We need to figure out a way to stop all the fucking people from dropping out of school need to figure out a way to pay for more schools and that kind of shit when you wouldn't that be the, the answer and some, some way.

Speaker 5:          00:37:17       In a perfect world, what's wrong with this world? This world worlds could be perfect if everybody got their shit together. If the world was filled with cool motherfuckers. It is a perfect world. We are the world we, ah, the trilogy in it's, it's totally possible for anyone to get their shit together up to a reasonable point. I feel like a serial killer. You probably shouldn't be fucking hanging around even if you're sorry. But you know what I mean? For most folks, it's very possible for anybody and at some point in the life to have some sort of an experience that puts them on some sort of a path to eventually getting your shit together. I don't, I don't count anybody out. I think it's almost possible for everybody except extreme idiots that are probably just here to dig holes. I think there's gotta be a few of those too, but other than that, right? Yes. I'm so fucking fake, Chris.

Speaker 5:          00:38:10       I agree with you. Yes. I'm so glad Tom. All down. I'm all down for positivity and prosperity, all that shit. Yeah. I just think we have to figure out a way to make people nicer in the best way is all the shit they're trying to keep us from. The best way is weed. You see this long beach raid, they fucking stepped in this kids neck as a kid. Did nothing wrong. Complied completely. They said, get on your knees, lift your hands up. I stepped on his back and then stepped on his neck. Big fucking cop. Big, big guy, man. It was just a clumsy stylic. Yeah. I don't give a shit like he doesn't give a fuck about him. Like I own you bitch. She stepped on him like a carpet. But the problem is they didn't know that they were being filmed and there was a camera up there and the camera apparently records at a remote location.

Speaker 5:          00:38:58       It doesn't even record there. So you can't like get the video. So the cops couldn't do anything. They smashed the cameras, but they couldn't do anything to get rid of the video. Do this fucking video of them smashing the cat. Well, it's the, first of all, cops have no business smashing security cameras. You have no business doing that. You're supposed to abide by the fucking law. Just because you're a cop does mean because you enjoyed that, that episode of shield. When a, that fucking, what does that was the, the shield was that dude's name Michael Chiklis. Michael Chiklis would rough people up and kick them. Step on their head that this is real life. You fucking cunt. You're being paid by these people. These people pay taxes. Fuckhead yeah, watch the video. It's on, I think harbor each rage on Youtube. I think that's what it is.

Speaker 5:          00:39:43       Look, they, you know, 20 years ago they would've beat the fucking kid to death with a bat and said that he came out and we won a knife. You know, if it was a, it was a bad cop. I think bad cops today are under much more scrutiny than bad cops in the past. You know, if you look, look at like Serpico and shit like that and look at those outputs, you know, movies and you know, hear about the stories of corruption in that movie. Cocaine cowboys where the whole Miami Police Department, half of the half of one year of the graduating class of the police academy, half of them were murdered and the other half of them went to jail for corruption. Like they were all gangsters. They were breeding gangsters. I don't think that's possible today. I think there's cops there are way better than they've ever been before, but a lot of them are under a lot of stress and they develop a fucking us versus them mentality and they do shit like that.

Speaker 5:          00:40:31       Or they just step on some kids and neck and they just did. It could, they could and that's a county thing, man. You can't just do something because you can, you can't just step on some kid's neck who's not doing anything wrong. It's Kaizen young kid to the kid looks like he's like 2021 years old, right? It doesn't look, it looks like a really young kid going after that guy. Someone going after the cop should man, this kid didn't do anything wrong. He did everything they asked of them and you know, it was, it was creeping is uh, you know, I don't want to bring race into it, but he's a black kid and they're, you know, they're stepping on his back and stepping on his neck and it's, you know, I don't know what the race of the cop was. He looked like he was a white cop.

Speaker 5:          00:41:08       I don't, I don't know what the fuck he was, but either way, man, that's fucking completely uncalled for. If that kid had been out there throwing rocks at cars in the street, fuck yes. Step on his neck. If that kid had been out there robbing old ladies or, or beating people up or, you know what? Yeah, fuck yeah. Step on his neck, man. Kick him in the fucking head once you have him down. But he didn't do anything and honestly, you should just comply with the law. You had him down on the ground. Just handcuff him. Yeah. But

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       I'm saying if none other dangerous person, you have to, you have to do something to immobilize them. You know, if you've got them lying down on the ground, man, I would for sure soccer, kick him in the head if it was legal or if you got to like a really dangerous guy. Like if you, if you have like some Ted Bundy type dude and you know, and you, you're in a situation with him, you know, we're, you know, he's, uh, he's resisting arrest. You're not gonna, you're not gonna kick him in the head while he's on his way down sticking his, but like, wouldn't you want to kill him punching as hard as I can to the shoulder punching in the shoulder? What's legal? But do you think it is the guy, if the guy makes a move on you, are you allowed to hit him?

Speaker 1:          00:42:11       Like how does it, how does that work for a cop? Cause cops have to be careful about that, right? Yeah, for sure. There's, there, they're always on edge because for sure, most people don't like to be arrested. And then you never know when someone's gonna fucking freak out and punch you in the face and try to get away with something. So for sure they have to be on edge all the time, but when they take it out on someone who does nothing, I can't take your side anymore because now you fucked up and he's, I'm on your side. When you're dealing with the cons of the world, I'm on your side. But when you do that to a kid, because he works in a place where they sell plants that make you happy, well then you're a cut. That's just the way it is. This poor cop became a cunt.

Speaker 1:          00:42:46       He became a cut by doing his job, probably didn't even realize he was a cunt. He realizes that he's a cut now. Now that video got out and people realize like what a, what a fucking shitty thing that is to do to a young kid. It's becoming real good business to ray dispensaries and just rob them. Yeah, they take their money, they take the money now it becomes more profitable for them, for more states to legalize it. You know? As medicine, they're just going to raid and fucking pillage. Yeah. Well, I, I, you know, I hope there's some way to stop that. I really do. It's a disgrace. And it's just one of those things where people are doing something just because they're allowed to do something. If you look at the allocation of resources and how, how much crime exists in our world, you would say, well, let's concentrate on the things that are really hurting people.

Speaker 1:          00:43:34       You know, his, his marijuana really hurting people. No, it's not. Well, you know, what's really hurting people, murders, you know, what's really hurting people, drunk drivers, you know, it's really hurting people. People that are trying to harm people. Uh, people that do assault and rapes, people that are there. It should be that. That's the stuff that we should be protecting people from. Number one, when we get that under wraps, then once you start looking at some other stuff like, you know, personal use stuff like alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, everything, all the above. I think we shouldn't examine them all equally. But that's that. What's, what's unfair about our society is that these people that are supposed to be in control supposed to be our leaders, our first sure under a financial umbrella of one aspect of the community that trying to keep these natural drugs illegal.

Speaker 1:          00:44:24       The pharmaceutical companies, they would, they would go lose an incredible amount of money if you took all the illegal shit like Ibogaine and marijuana, if that, all that stuff started getting researched and all that stuff started getting laws passed and and government, you know, foundations where they set up Ibogaine research centers where people go in to relieve themselves of addictions. If that shit started to happen and man pharmaceutical drug companies would lose a fuck load of money. I'm not saying they want people to be addicted to like oxies and shit like that, but people are in kicked in and then that money's coming in. Man, that might come in and, and it's not a little money, it's rivers and rivers of money. The pharmaceutical industry is so big, even if they have the best intentions, the amount of money is so staggering. It just gets out there and then it finds a way to get out their salesmen.

Speaker 1:          00:45:19       Even it's not the fucking companies idea. They just need to take the weight off their shoulders, leave it to the pharmaceutical representatives and the pharmaceutical representatives. They take nurses out to dinner and doctors out to dinner and they fund like golf trips and shit and they're like, come and support us stuff and then like, like street hustlers, you know, and then they connected to the people. Then boom, people just get pop pills every way you look. It's amazing. It's amazing that we, we, we, we see it. It's all written right down right there and yet the government doesn't do anything about it. If they don't investigate that instead they go after medical marijuana dispensaries. That's ridiculous. If you look at the things that are doing harm in this world that you would spend any time whatsoever, it's just like, why are you doing that? You haven't done your homework yet.

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       You haven't finished your job. We haven't done the right thing. Why are you concentrating on these extracurricular things? Because they're written down and they're easy. It's written down that it's legal. It's even though the community would completely disagree, if you look at allocation of resources, I guarantee you the community would completely disagree that forget about all the murderers. Let's, let's, let's get a team of people together that aren't doing any other real police work that day and make them do something that's a boring, make them rob a bunch of fucking people that are selling marijuana state. Legally sad. It's sad. It's sad that the cops have to resort to that. It's sad. It's weird seeing the undercover cop in the, in the video because he didn't like they, he was dressed up like all teenagers. The whole thing is creepy. Completely sad is fuck. I feel sad for the cops that have to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:46:53       I really do. I think most cops do not want to do bullshit, stupid fucking pot. Dispensary bus, especially this one. This one's so small. If you look at it, it looks like it's just a tiny operation, but they just destroyed it and stepped on people. It's fucking gross. You know the, the cop, I blame the leadership man. I blame the leadership. I think you know, most of these street cops, they do what they have to do because they get, they get told what to do. All right. I think that we had a look at what we're doing, man. You can't keep arresting people for no fucking reason just because they're selling weed. It's stupid. It's just stupid. Let them pay taxes. God Damn, and there's money to be made here or treat them at least like humans. At least you know the, the, the whole idea of like going after them and rating them and taking the money.

Speaker 1:          00:47:36       It's so gross. It's disgusting. It's like, what do you, what are you preventing you preventing any crime other than the stupid fucking written thing that says somewhere that you're not supposed to enjoy certain experiences because the government has deemed them out of your reach. The government that hasn't even had these experiences. That's, that's this, this disgusting. Goddammit Eddie Bravo. Yeah, man. It's disgusting, right? Yes. Checked out. You know the people at the high levels, they know the truth. They know how beautiful and magical the plan is. You think that's what real artists, they do? The people that they actually experienced it. You don't think the pharmacists, uh, business doesn't know that you think they don't have any idea? Of course they know you're going to stomp it out. If you work for a pharmaceutical business, you just get pharmaceuticals like a motherfucker like every day or at the office just trading pills back and forth to each other.

Speaker 1:          00:48:28       Oh, you know what? I will say this man. I fucked up my back the other day and Jujitsu and I took a Vicodin. I took a Vicodin and two percosets and my back was still fucked up. That shit fucks with your boner. First time ever I went limp during sex. Wow. I can I get a perk it? Yeah. It was on two, two percosets, maybe three and Vicodin and that night I tried to have sex. My deck. It sounds like your body is probably doesn't work poisoned at first time I went, he's limping a long time. Anyhow. That's a lot of shit man. You supposed to mix them like that. My back's fucked right now. It's still fucked up. What party? Your back. Your lower back. Lower back and froze on me, man. I slept on the floor last night and trying to try to work it out.

Speaker 1:          00:49:06       Apparently if you sleep on the floor, I don't know if that's a myth that if you sleep on the floor it's supposed to like it's good for your past. She'd get in isolation and that'll help a little. It doesn't seem like it would be. It seems like your back would be ruined and sleeping on the floor, but you get a massage or anything. No, I haven't. I haven't had time to use a pillow. Go and need one. I can go to a deep tissue person. Someone who's going to fuck your shit up time. Yeah, that's good too. But you might be like in pain for a time massage. They I want to bend you up and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:49:34       Yesterday I'm on no pain pills today. Yesterday I was on the pain pills. I'm a no pain pills today, but, and it still hurts, but at least I don't have to take vicodins. Wow, man. I never take shit when I get injured. I hurt my back pretty bad like four months ago. It was a real annoying thing for a while. I'm glad that I can just deal with it because if I had gotten on something, if I had taken some sort of pain pills, I'd be taking it for a few months and I who I could have gotten addicted easily, you know? I don't know. I don't know what the physiological effects of that are, but I was in some pretty good pain most of the time for like a whole month and a half and a 98% of the time I have sex, I'm high and that is a fucking my butter. No, it does. It better. It makes, it doesn't make you more compassionate. It makes you more like sensual Bra. Makes the organism actually see. I'm weird about it. I even, I like, I like weed, but I think alcohol, I love

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       fucking one. I'm on alcohol [inaudible] ambition thing, but a lot of people don't like the really alcohol, you know, people can get it, you know, whiskey Dick, you know, or something like that. If you get really fucked up, you can get whiskey deck, but you'd have to drink a lot. Yeah, I would not. I would have to be not alive. Yeah, of course. You're limited. You have a glass of wine I've gotten with correct before. For sure. Real fuck. Yeah, for sure. I think I've ever been done that too. If you fuck, you start the problem when you start drinking his alcohol reduces inhibitions, right? It removes your inhibitions and it removes your inhibitions more with every drink. So you know, if you're, if you're a little, you know, a little tipsy, you got like a little bit of inhibitions. Throw up on a check. No.

Speaker 2:          00:51:13       Right. As I was about to eat her pussy hot chick, I was 19. I was like, we were drinking greyhounds. I'll never forget it was the gray house. We just pound Greyhound is, uh, I think it's Gen. Uh, it's a plan. It's a grey hound. It's, it's light green, light yellow. I'm not sure what the alcohol, a bunch of blueberries, it's grapefruit juice and vodka or something like that. I think it's great food, juice and vodka. Anyways, it was a greyhound. Whatever the fuck it is. I'm not a bartender. So mad. I couldn't believe I was getting this piece sash. Super Hot, open up the legs and right. All I remember is I threw up, grabbed me, she grabbed me, they dragged me down the hallway and I just remember scenes of going through the hallway, throwing up down the hallway and they're trying to get me to the toilet and I finally get to the toilet. I have a couple more, uh, JAKKS left. Never fucked her. I never saw her again. Never saw that when I was, there's no way you can come back from that. You can fuck up the throw up into her. When I was young and I use a lube on her ass when I was prime carrot in there. What's, take the carrot out. Fuck in the ass. Enzymes are retarded. I think you burn yourself. It probably burned it down. It's this whole, sir, what do you have? Bio Burns on your Dick. Whatever. Whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:52:46       Fucking nothing. Come on. Who loves it man? Nobody ain't throw it up on your Dick. Tried to fuck your blow up. You threw up in her and then just said it's all slippery down there. Let me just start good like Goolarri and shit. Maybe I fell asleep balls going down on my girlfriend once. At least once. I used to have my paper route. That's quite common, but I didn't fall asleep cause I was tired cause I fucking threw papers all day. I got tired. I'd be like drunk and I partied all night. You just get home and pull down your pants. You just fall asleep or something. She goes to the bathroom and you're just waiting. Then you're done.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       She comes back and you're snoring. [inaudible] paper boys. Yeah, I was. How creepy is that now looking back, they don't have, it wasn't always. That was a paper man. I had a car. I only delivered with a car. I was in the six or seventh grade and I remember waking up at 5:00 AM my parents weren't even awake and I would like go outside and find these newspapers and like have to put them in the bags. You know what, man, it's weird now because the fact that you were out there, you know, on supervised and we know how creepy people are, how creepy adults are, but it's good for a kid to get some sort of responsibility, something that they don't want to necessarily do but they do and learn how to like just fucking some shit in your life is going to need to just get done.

Speaker 1:          00:54:10       You got to need to do that. You know? And there's, there's a, there's a good benefit to teach you the kid that early, you know? And that's what's great about a paper route, a paper route. I was like, I remember kids that I knew that had paper routes when I was young. They would like more organized than the other kids. They're like more like, like Jimmy's got a fucking landscape business, right? He's 13 fucking landscape business. Like this kid, he started out with a paper route and then he, I mean when the key was like fucking delivering newspapers on a bike every morning before school. Like that guy's a ambitious is fuck. Like he would get up like an hour and a half before everybody else had to get up for school and he would go down with his bike, get as newspapers and then fucking drive around on his bike and deliver newspapers.

Speaker 1:          00:54:51       That motherfucker had some sticktuitiveness. You know what I mean? I had a friend did the same thing. One of my good friends growing up. Yeah. You think you are and you learn how to like, you learn how to work hard when you're a kid like that, but that's not good. I think. Uh, I was never good at waking up early. It's torture. It's not why I sleep is awesome. God Damn. I'm enjoying my life right now. It's one of the things monkeys like to do. Sit back and fucking chill. Oh Man. Can I just relax a little longer? Yeah. Apparently when you get older you don't want to sleep in anymore. You just wake up. Is that true? I've been waking up earlier because you always hear like old people waking up at six or five people weird. Who knows? Everybody's got their own clock. My clock is, I'm up like, it's been my clock since I was a comedian or you, uh, or time to get you right.

Speaker 1:          00:55:41       Noonish noon. It, she'd go that deep. Yeah. I like to go noonish up really, really early. I'm up late, but you're always up later than me. I usually like five. Yeah. The my best. My best shit gets done. My best work gets done at night when I know everybody else is asleep from, for whatever reason. I want to know my whole neighborhoods asleep. I want to know there's nothing, there's no sound. It's just like Mike Tyson shit right there. I don't know what, I don't know what it is. Didn't he get up like at three because no one else was working out. Yeah. We'll get up at three o'clock in the morning because I knew my opponent's wouldn't be doing that. That's really good, man. Mike Tyson is one of the, he's an easy one.

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       Easy one. Yeah. Tyson and Arnold and uh, those are like the staples. Yeah. For a while, when we were younger, it was captain Kirk and Jack Nicholson. Remember everybody would do a Jack Nicholson impression. Yeah. It's a weird thing, dude. You can miss the funniest of oppression right now. I don't know who's like the funniest impressionist? Who's like the, that your favorite guy. That's Michael Winslow. A seamless, sandy does. He's still around. He's, he's the guy that makes insane noises with his mouth. He still does voice, just like whammy pedals and shit. Like his show is ridiculous. Like you can't believe that it's actually coming out of his mouth. He did. Um, um, uh, what is not purple haze? Fuck. What is the, uh, I forget what the fucking Stan Voodoo child he did Voodoo child. The beginning with his mouth. You should actually pull it up cause it's kind of fucking incredible.

Speaker 4:          00:57:17       Michael Winslow. Michael. Yeah. We played this like, did we play at like 10 episodes ago? Yeah. I don't remember playing. I tell you to shut. The only way I know. No, I didn't. You told me about it. Did I really? Yeah, sure. Yeah, we played in, I forgot, but I want to see it again. Can we see it again please? Cause I, um, I forgot how, I think it was a long time ago, dude. Now, cause I remember it was about maybe 20 episodes, but there's something cool about watching someone imitate. Oh, you know who was a fucking awesome impressionist dice clay. Yeah. Dice clay has like the best John Travolta. Amazing. Ciao. Ciao. Freddie Lockhart. Jeff Richards is really good. It's really good. Yeah. Freddie Lockhart's amazing. Freddie Freddy Lockhart. It's Morgan Freeman. That's probably one of the best impressions I've ever heard is as dead on as you can get. Like if he called you up, you know, and said, I'd like to put you in a movie, you'd be like, whoa. Shit. Being a movie with Morgan Freeman. This is crazy, man. This is going to freak you out of the original artists. Can you eat? Yeah. Alright. Alright. Have you heard this? This is a dude with a good heart and then Michael Winslow, his mouth.

Speaker 6:          00:58:31       Oh, it's whole lot of love. That's what it is. Fuck yeah, yeah. Fuck yeah. Okay man. That's his mouth. No,

Speaker 4:          01:00:00       there's a lot of comedy snobs out there, man that got no respect for Michael Winslow. You know, I think that guy, that's incredible. That's amazing genius. It's people are like, oh, he's making noises with his mouth. That is completely not just what he's doing. He's on some crazy, another level with that. Yeah. That is wild, man. That was great. The fucking noises that he can make with his mouth and the way he did an intune and even as same was good. Yeah. His fucking Robert Plant was good. Yeah. That's amazing. You have to watch that folks who would check that out on youtube because it's, it's, it's a weird thing to watch it watch it and go like, wow. Like you really get the, you see the guy that's his mouth motherfucker. You think he smokes weed?

Speaker 4:          01:00:46       He's got two. If he doesn't say yes, if he doesn't, I would be shot. God, if he doesn't, he's even more impressive. Yeah. Imagine if he does it. You got to get them high and then w shit, he'll take that shit to the next level to matches the fucking noises like I would make. If he doesn't, then he got some shit. Wonder if when he met, when he fucks, if he has like a little joke you guys did a laser probably throws his voice. Tends to be other people who probably has that killers cause everyone's got it. Okay. Now I got a cool but he's probably got a fucking one that's in stereo while he probably can pretend to be different dudes too. Yeah. Checks like damn, come in with a fucking Australian cattle ranchers had on long mustache and a new voice. I just want to eat this policy.

Speaker 4:          01:01:37       If there was a thing like what we were talking about earlier about actually having an artificial experience, you know, and, and you know, if we ever get to the point technologically where they can do that, like shut you off and tune you into some crazy fake avatar world for like an hour, would you be willing to take that chance? Would you be willing to try that? It depends. If I haven't been China I would be um, cannot just for one hour. But I mean, would you trust it? Would you trust it? Do you mean would you, would you look like when you have a second dog experience, the scariest part about it is right before you're about to do it. You know, when you're like, fuck, I can't fucking let go here. If people were dying from this shit, no, I wouldn't do it. I'd wait for the what it would, if it was the first time, you wouldn't want to be like the, the first half of the artificial lip.

Speaker 4:          01:02:26       Yeah. I would trust that more than trusting like cricket mobiles thing to the Moon because then all the fucking commercials if you have you been, uh, another person or another life, if you have chosen spider woman, you could have cancer will fight for you. You know what I mean? You never know these pills that come out a year later, they're giving you fucking heart attacks. Well, there's some of them that are certainly doing that. Doctor [inaudible], doctor Drusen deep shit. What's up with that? Doctor drew apparently was paid to talk up or allegedly, I should say, paid to talk up the sexual side effects of certain, um, uh, what do they call that? The price tag depressants, but I forget the actual technical term. Maybe one girl, this type, this type of antidepressant on many people with many formulations causes people to go limb, but some girl calls up and says she had like 150 orgasms and then doctor drew was apparently pushing this stuff and they paid him a quarter of a million dollars to do that and he didn't really necessarily disclose that they paid him all this money allegedly.

Speaker 4:          01:03:33       But I would like to see that girl do 150 orgasms whenever I, that'd be so hot. That bitch sounds crazy, but you never know when people are trolling. She's calling loved line manage could be totally trolling. I mean there's people completely pretend that they have something wrong with them when they don't feel it. For sure. They get a lot of people that are, that are legit, but they must, we know all the trolls and the Internet. You don't think that people are compiling some troll footage on Loveline can check out her mattress, see if there's any stains. I'm sure if he had that much orgasms, there's going to be a lot. Yeah, that's what you would do. Well, I'm not sure if I believe your story, ma'am. So let me come to your house and deeply investigate your claim by going in your fucking bedroom and examining your mattress.

Speaker 4:          01:04:10       You do you even hear yourself? Do you ever look at your old mattress? I just got a new mattress. That's how I know I took off my shirt rose. It was, it looked like fucking sh brown drip like a look like a lot of liquids and stepping in there with like some blood spots. You know a lot of different colors. Easy over here. Well they say that your, your mattress actually gets heavier with human skin cells. Like you know your matches when you buy it as like x amount of weight and then you have it for a couple of years and it's like heavier. That's creepy as shit man. We're pros. We're gross man. We, that's what dust is most of is our skin are creepy fucking skin sheets on your bed. You know, it's key. This time around. I actually scrubbing everything this time around. I got something, it's like these waterproof sheets where you put it around your whole entire mattress and it locks it into nothing and get in there and it's on the outside, it feels like nice cough cushion and then you put your regular sheets on top of that and it's wholly will make that shit not happened.

Speaker 4:          01:05:11       You know like the stains and like the all the dust and skin and bugs and it makes it like waterproof pretty much to him. She goes out the code. A lot of proof sheets I think there. Oh, so does it feel like slimy underneath, you know, slip around now because it's like, it's like on the outside it's like a, I was like that bird like a fabric I real soft. Like almost like teddy bear on the, okay. I would hate it back in my single days I would hate it when girls would have like silk, like periods and shit during the sex and like you just ruined my, the shit went all the way through to the mattress. I know. It sucks. It sucks man. Everyone has, not everyone, but uh, I'm sure you've had a mattress or two that had like all sorts of stuff. You gotta you gotta you gotta put a towel down son?

Speaker 4:          01:06:01       Yeah. Or they say, no, I'm done. I stopped yesterday and then you fuck them. It starts back up and then you have a girl that works and just don't you feel embarrassed for the girl though. Do you ever actually get upset at a girl if she has her period? No. No, no, no. I don't. I don't, but I don't like when it's messy. I've always been so happy that someone was willing to fuck me. I'm like, oh, well you made a mess. You shit the bed. Wow. Let's just clean that up and not worry about that. Is it different than blood all over my dick that isn't, I guess washed that shit up. There's just now I got stains on shit. There's a difference between that. Like where you know, you, you fuck them in it's accidently blood or when they just like know that their period was near and they'd like, no, I just want to sleep naked.

Speaker 4:          01:06:41       And you're like, come on. That's not taking responsibility for having an open wound, you know? Oh, does that, does it leak out while they're, while they're sleeping? Yeah, I guess so. I mean that's it. That's how it leaks out when their panties, you know, earlier design. Yeah. Fucking crazy design. Like for one time every month your, your shit just sort of doesn't happen. What if our dicks blood like just peed blood all the time. It's just strange. It's just a strange thing that happens when you're getting ready. Yeah. Just sheds the inside of your Dick Sheds. Honey, would you blow me? But I'm on my period to start by doing. Some girls would like it. They want the extra protein of the blood. Golf chicks did want to blow you when you were on your period. It'd be really hot.

Speaker 4:          01:07:32       Yeah. We're lucky at a lot of ways, man. We'd love to, we don't give birth. I've always said that men had their dicks explode like a girl's pussy was to go through damage. Or if you had to get us Aserion to have a kid, how many kids would there be if dude's got pregnant? We had to have a sincerity and every time we gave birth, I feel like, go Connie, I don't know. I had to work. I've got no fucking time to have this, this hereon. Okay, I can't take me out of work for a month. Jesus fucking Christ, glorify Dick's exploded. Imagine the does it would want to carry a baby. That was the two options. You can either go the old school where we did loads and they never used it again. That almost be almost be gay, right? Well maybe that would be the way that they would prevent men from having more than one child. The child

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       would come out of your deck and so you, you impregnate, you have sex with a woman and a, you know, you feel like you're impregnating her, you shoot a load out, but it actually goes back inside of you from the woman. Something that drops a fucking hatch in there. You get the egg from the moment of plants inside your body. Maybe that's it. There you go. And so when the baby comes out, it comes out through your deck and boom, that's it. One kid. That's all you get raised it, right? Wow, that's great. That's a crazy idea. That actually is probably a good idea. That might be the best way to save the world. We've got to reengineer people. So the babies come out of men and their dicks explodes and that'll put everything in perspective. There will only be a thousand people on earth though. Probably not even a thousand, right? Be like a hundred a hundred feet. Little fishing villages scattered throughout the world with dudes. It's blown out. Dicks

Speaker 3:          01:09:08       are you shit out a baby. That'd be awesome. They figure out a way to, to plan a baby inside your,

Speaker 5:          01:09:13       um, large. Be so selfish. You'd be like, you really want to shit on your baby. That's ridiculous. Then you just ruin the wedding. It's so ridiculous that you've made a shit that's realistic, man. Come on. What did you used to have a sketchy road call? Shit baby. My friend Amir had a really funny joke about, and my friend, he was like real like deadpan. He's like, yeah, my friend got his girlfriend pregnant from anal sex. The baby looked like shit. Somebody just said that exact same joke the other day. That was the premise of shit, baby. Anybody. It's not like the most brilliant, you know, original thought. It was just the way mirror did it. It was very funny. So funny. James Lemur was his name in Boston. He had a, he had a different name. His real name is Amir, but he, he was like a very Jewish name, but he changed it to James' name.

Speaker 3:          01:10:13       Shit baby was about, um, the opening scene is some girls getting plowed in the ass really hard dude. Nuts pulls out, jumps in the shower, she's laying there face down, huffing and puffing. The camera's zooms in on the butt and you see come dripping out of the butthole end of the pussy. Right Tom. So then she gets pregnant and uh, she, when she has the baby, like woven into the baby's DNA is that smell of feces. So it was just, it just, that's the problem with the baby. The baby just got just stinks. Like shit, there's flies around the baby at all times. So this chick brings up this kid as a documentary. This Chad brings up this kid that smells like shit. Like what would, I mean everyone should go, she's spraying on the end of the basketball everywhere. Just constantly flies everywhere. Smell is a weird thing. It's really weird that we all accept that there's some invisible shit. Then we can take in with a hole in our face. You know, it's kind of weird, you know, the invisible. That's awesome.

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       Like when you walk into a, a good burrito place and you smell the Mexican food cooking. Oh yeah. Fogo perfect example. Smelled that meat as it's coming by. It's weird, man. It's like, it's a weird invisible thing, but your, your nose can pick it up. You can even smell where things like if you pick up your underwear and go to the crotch, you could smell like that. You've worn it. You could smell your body on that. That's crazy. Some invisible identity shit that you leave behind. Nothing's worse than human shit for sure. That bad pussy and feet, bad feet. That's it. Yeah, that's right. And corpse. Anything that's trying to keep you away from it. It's interesting how that works. I mean it's your, your brain is really fine tuned to like get away from anything that's really bad for you and so you sounds an alarm when you're in the presence of a decaying corpse.

Speaker 5:          01:12:09       All those chemicals set an alarm through your system and you just, you just immediate, nobody likes it. Yeah. The thought of eating that corpse is impossible. Some people, there's a small percentage of people that do like it. Yeah. Oh most. Some people like, you know, all sorts of weird things. The smell of a dead rotting body can imagine that if you knew somebody that actually liked that and the confession that like say I don't, I don't, I've never told anybody before but I fucking love running flash. I think that that could be possible like for, for anything. I mean I think there's people that are nutty enough to get in love with anything they can get in love with cutting their own finger. What's the latest with the Mat Salts? Give me the latest. I know you know what the would pass salts are and this is what it's been explained to me is that you can take a drug that's an illegal drug and all you have to do is change certain molecules in that drug and then you release it.

Speaker 5:          01:13:00       Like you add like a salt to it and you release it as bath salts and you say not for human consumption, but people know what it actually is and you can go and buy it and you're essentially buying like a sort of a designer drug. You're, you're buying something that hasn't been classified and they're really intense and they, they have really bad profiles. Like if you look at like, um, there's a erowid.org that shows a lot of trip reports and uh, whatever the compound that they're calling, you know, there's, there's several different types. I think I might be wrong about that. I don't think bath salts is necessarily just one thing. I think there's been more than one, but someone please on Twitter, correct me if I'm wrong. So I think it's a, it's a problem of they can do that with several different drugs. I think they can do that with things that are illegal. Just change, you know, if meth is illegal, change math. If a ecstasies illegal, change it a little bit here, change a little bit, add a little bit here and in, and they're doing it without any real research as to what kind of an effect these hardcore drugs are going to have in this sort of hybrid form. You know,

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       this is just letting people take this stuff. You know, and people this, you know, I don't know how many people are taking it and losing their fucking mind, but a few people seem to me, it seems to be a good one. It seems to be one that's kind of quite a fucking kick. Mec Chris has a new song about taking bath salts and it's awesome. Did he do it? Did he actually take power? No, no, no, no, no, but it's just it really addicting. And what's one of the songs? What did you hear it? You're just singing it all the time. It's like about, you know, doing bath salts and wanting to eat your face off. It's great. But that Dude Chris, they said that they see Chris. Yeah. Is he funny? Is that funny rapper? Yeah, but they said that dude wasn't on Bass Hall. It's the guy that a bit the guard's face off.

Speaker 4:          01:14:50       They're saying now that he was on marijuana reefer as, yeah. Okay. Do you want to reveal it now? No, dude. That's way worse than reefer madness. Madness propaganda. They never said he'll eat someone's face. Right. That's worse. Back in the thirties I was saying that if you smoked weed, you'd go crazy and shoot people. Well, they didn't really have the, they didn't have the capacity to test for this hidden metabolite. They tested for things that were, they were known and that's what the, uh, the argument is against it. That they didn't, I don't know if that's correct either. By the way, that's not the illegal in Vegas. So if you want to maybe do it this weekend, guys, is it legal in Vegas? Yeah. Jesus Christ. Wow. I hope they take care of that. I don't know what that is. That's a scary thing to me though. You know, and the fact that these people are breaking down medical marijuana dispensary as while they're selling bath salts, but other people were there still on bath salts. What's a funny set picture?

Speaker 4:          01:15:47       So me on the message board, we throw it up on some chick's pussy [inaudible] who is slain and Jack Tillo slain in charts. Hilarious. I pick, I'm going to, I'm going to tweet this pic real quick. Wow. That's a hard word. Slain in jealous. Hilarious. That's a great pick. That's hilarious. That's the Internet for you folks. Do you? Internet will always be on shit like that. That's awesome. I'm about to tweet the pictures so you know what we're talking about. I'll retweet it like, did you see this girl with her Nice Muffler? It's like, Brian, do you want a podcast right now? And you've walked looking at porn. You're getting distracted. If I was your boss, oh wait, it's the message. Don't be staring at plus corporate website. Which headquarters?

Speaker 4:          01:16:44       You see Ted yet? Anyone? No, I have not seen 10 yard. It's awesome. I heard it's one of the funniest movies of all time. All right. It's hilarious. I don't love it. I never fell in love with it, but it was so great the whole time that I love. I love. I like it a lot. Meaning there's nothing wrong with it. It's when it's a great movie. I recommend to everybody, but I never did the extra where, Oh my God. I went to buy a Ted Teddy bear now in like, you know, like a freak out by Ted shirts and stuff. Bear. I never got, I never got to that level of just, it was pretty good thing into a six year old was pretty good. Fucking crazy loud. Like teddy bear level. Like I bet the SQL be a million times better. What are you talking about? Why would you say that you're just spouting off crazy shit today. I if it four and a half stars. Oh five Brian, that's pretty fucking good. Yeah, that sounds good. Awesome. You know something fun. I probably kept him off the podcast right there.

Speaker 4:          01:17:37       There was a couple parts. This asshole. Here's a couple of parts. So it was red band and we're like, they remade a wreak make like it was weird. Oh, check it out. They don't say anything. Don't say a word. You fuck. I'm going to a director's cut. I think it would be better. Maybe it is the director Scott. Fuck. Do you know? Maybe I, yeah. Yeah. You don't know. There probably is. There's mushrooms in it is young cocaine today. Something's going on. I Dunno man. Yeah, like asleep and electrocuted. I've been, what was the last summer to olive garden? Last Sunday. Be Honest. Seriously, and I Sunday last Sunday. All right. That's what you want to stick to the story and I went with somebody that it's never been there before and it was their first time and they had prejudged. I don't really want to talk about the old guard.

Speaker 4:          01:18:28       Are you fucking kidding me here? The fuck is wrong. We have a couple of hours to do this. Don't let this guy sit and talk about breadsticks. How about them? Dodgers don't make me bring in Joey Diaz. What the fuck dude, why would you see then I said what you like karate. Can I say one thing about the opposite? It's kind of weird. Now they're combining red lobster and olive garden test market city, so you can actually choose between both menus. Isn't that cool? Because they're like going bankrupt. We're trying this thing. You haven't seen the new joined karate? No, I haven't seen it. That's great. Is that he kills it because he talk about the upcoming fights. Oh, pull it up, put it on. Well, how do you find that? It's 10 planet Kush episode. Uh, 25 10 flag Kush. Episode 25 this weekend's going to be insane.

Speaker 4:          01:19:13       That rematch that we matches the biggest rematch of all time in my opinion, as far as like fights and I want to see this is in my opinion, the biggest rematch of all time. So greatest fight of all time. Are you kidding? I'm so Loretta's fights rematches generally. Cause that was something crazy. What's up 39 you said 10th Planet Kush. 25 25 Joey crushes it. Yeah. This, this is the biggest rematch ever, right? Yeah. Here it is. If you wait following at mad flavor, go fuck yourself. This is under a twister. Eddie on Youtube, by the way. That's where I found God. Volume. It's going to start.

Why the fuck is he quitting? He's won one in six. You understand me? It's time to go cup soccer. That's all I can tell you. I love you the deck.

Speaker 7:          01:21:28       Congratulations. You and forest Whitaker. I love the fucking fight, but I wouldn't bet you motherfuckers at all. Another fight on the card is commonly the flying fucking master of kicks on Cinemax versus the comeback. The leg. What's his name? Patrick fucking coat. Tank fighting. I'll come back in. The UFC slipped that one in. So you've got Kung Lee against fucking Damon. Who's he fighting? Oh, he's fighting. Uh, Patrick Hotel. The one fucking legged man from Canada.

Speaker 7:          01:22:19       He's got a bus full of kids, Anderson, and he's back. He's going to Las Vegas this weekend. Let me tell you something, channel. I love you to death, but it's all over the shot and I don't care what the odds are. I don't care what fucking, uh, Kenny Florian says, or Jon, Anik, I don't give a fuck. This is going to be ugly. I'm going with my man, Anderson Silva to fucking take it to champ. The last time he fought bad and he got him in the fifth fucking around. They got beat up. Can you imagine a healthy fucking Anderson Silva? Take your little fucking panties. Forget going to the Strip club. Put It on the Anderson. You got the fucking Parlay Mendez and who else? What the fuck people are you all sleeping here? [inaudible] yum, yum. Kim Against Cody Mackenzie. Paula. Oh Yum. Yum Kim against my man. Fuck 10 plan to take it from that.

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       Tim is not fighting. Chad Mendez. Cody Mckinsey's fighting Chad. Man. Fuck it all up. Motherfuckers right there. Oh my God, he's so high. Our apologies to the grade Dong Young Kim for Joey Diaz messing up his word. Calling them yum. Yum Kim. That's uh, that's Kinda rude.

Speaker 8:          01:23:26       How dare he, I thought it was hilarious. Pissed off. Like people are calling them yum. Yum Kim. Now all over the inner, what do you think about Damien Maia dropping down to one 70? Uh, he's uh, he's going to be a big one 70.

Speaker 5:          01:23:39       If he can do it right, it'll be, can do and be healthy for folks who don't know, you know, follow MMA. Damien Maia, is this one of the best Jujitsu guys to ever enter into MMA? He's a multiple time world champion. Just so really killer technical Jujitsu guy. And he entered into MMA and for awhile he was strangling a lot of people, including Chael Sonnen. Uh, he got Chael Sonnen, a mounted triangle. Remember that Shit. Hold them on. Yeah, he uh, he, he took them down. Remember that? What the fuck did he use?

Speaker 8:          01:24:08       Was it a lateral drop? I think it was a lot drive him off guard cause child did not think he was going to take them down. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:24:15       Didn't think he was going to try that move. Yeah. He liked lateral, dropped him and then mounted triangle. Tim, it was so sweet man. It was like really the the quickest I've ever seen shale gets submitted. It was like when he got taken down it was like bang, whoop. Oh Shit. He's caught tap. It was, it was just his Jujitsu. Damien Maia when he's on, when he catches you is so picture perfect man. He's such a beast and if he's able to get ahold of guys at one 70 he'll be even better.

Speaker 8:          01:24:44       But it's about whether or not this is healthy and whether or not he could still take him down at one 70 and there's monsters. Jake shields guys that he's not going to be able to take down. Yeah. I think his Jujitsu, you make one mistake with Damien. My you're fucked. Yeah. He's a finisher. He knows how to close the deal. He catches you in a triangle. It's oversight. You're not escaping. He's totally professional. When it comes to submissions, I just liked it, liked it better when he had more faith in his half guard because you know, early UFC days he wouldn't hesitate to pull guard. He pulled guard, he actually pulled half guard and there's a big difference between jumping guard, pulling guard and pulling half guard. He pulled half guard. He had a lot of faith in his half guard in the early, um, early UFC fights, but he likes to stand more now and he has totally made a conscious decision not to pull guard, not to have that as an option.

Speaker 8:          01:25:34       And I think you should reconsider that option. And look at what Paul Sas is doing. He's just, when Paul Sas fights, he's completely taken the dude's wrestling and striking out of the mix because if Paul Sas is fighting a Combo fighter who's a world champion, kickboxer Killen and k one, and he's a, uh, a Olympian rustler to him, he's going to pull guard anyway, so he'd come, he takes those two, uh, um, skill sets out of the picture. I'm not saying that you should just go out there and pull garlic, but you should have a guard like Paul Sassy should pull guard. Yeah. And Damien Maia does have a guard by Paul says he does. He has a very dangerous guy. Damien Maia is, God is amazing. He just is chosen not to have that as an option anymore. And I think I always call it the third option and it should be an option in your game.

Speaker 8:          01:26:23       You should. What do you think keeps him from getting hit on the ground? I think, um, well a lot of people think that they say they're, that they don't work on their guard techniques are there half guard. They don't refine it. Because in MMA when you're on your back, you're losing. That's what that's like. The thing to say about that, and professional fighters, a lot of them think that this way that if you're on your back, you're losing. Yes. But you're also losing. If you're on your feet getting tattooed with punches, you're also losing their, so what's the difference if you're losing on your feet and lose it on the ground, at least if you have a really good half guard game, you have a really good full guard game. You have a really dangerous rubber guard. If you've got a lot of heat off your back, there is a way for you to win off your back.

Speaker 8:          01:27:12       Instead of, I'm on my back, I'm losing. There's no hope if Aoki, he's on his back. There is hope for him. When you remember when Jason Day fought Alan Belcher and just held him and rubber guard and elbowed them, you could just do that. You could just hold it a dude in mission control and throw elbows. It's been proven that it's very effective. It's out there. The evidence is there, but just, you know, we just got to get wicked good at it. I mean, they're like a guy who's going to pull it off as a guy like Vinny, Vinny Magalhaes. He's going to be able to pull it up. If it it, if he could get the fight to the ground because vending is not the greatest restaurant on the planet and he's not the greatest striker on the planet. He is improving both vastly. He's working on it and he, he has accepted, I talked to him personally.

Speaker 8:          01:27:54       He has accepted that he will pull guard if he can't take the guy down because there's only three things you can do in a fight, and I've said this many times, there's only three things. You could stand with a guy, you could try to take a guy down or you can pull guard. That's it. There's no other way to fight. You fight in her feet, you gotta fight, you try to take them down or your pull guard. Most people only have two options. If they can't take the guy down, they better be able to beat him standing or they lost. Just like that. I wish that the cutting weight was not in the equation. This bothers me, but, but this is what I'm talking about has nothing to do with, wait. What I'm talking about is having the, are having strategy ways. Three ways. The win.

Speaker 8:          01:28:33       Most fighters only have two ways. I think the fighter of the future is going to have three ways to win. He's going to be a serious striker and can fucking knock you out. But if shit ain't going right standing, he can take you down cause he has a Olympic Jon Jones. Yeah, wrestling or if he can't take you down or if you can't take your opponent down and he's beating you standing. If you have a wicked guard, you have the option to pull guard. Like Paul Saskatoon, he wins all his fights by pulling guard. It's his first option. I don't agree that it should be a first option all the time. I think I would want my fighters to get as good as possible with our striking and the wrestling. If you could take a guy down, don't fucking pull guard. Take his ass down. If you can beat him standing, don't take them down.

Speaker 8:          01:29:15       Keep standing with them. You're fucking, you own this guy. But if the god of my fighters getting own standing and it can't take the guy down, you have to pull guard. That's the only thing you can do. And the guys that are missing an easy thing to pull off. It's not easy. You just don't sit. I'm not talking about specialists, Paul Sas opponents. I know what he's looking to do. Pulling Guard has become very complex. You've got to understand the difference between jumping guard, jumping guard is when you're against the fence like Stefan struve did. He was, he had his back against the fence, so it was really easy because he was being pinned on the fence. Really easy to just jump up and go Koala on him. He jumped guard, pulled them down and went right to an arm bar. It works. There's an option. There's a way out.

Speaker 8:          01:29:55       Anytime you're on your back in a fight, any all fighters out there, anytime you've been on your back and had a guy on a full guard, you actually had an opportunity to beat that guy right there. That's an odd, it's not, don't look at that last time. Dinny Magallanes guard, Shinya Aoki Guard. There's only a few people who've really taken the time to master fighting off your back because most fighters coming in, they listened to their instructors and the instructors say, Oh, if you're on your back, you're losing. Well, especially if you mean you get on your back with a fucking big Russell that you can't hold onto it like a Jake Ellenberger type character. It's going to ground and pound your fucking face off. That's a scary spot to be. You know, currently you have to have, it's not that scary if you're Vinnie Magallanes. He wants you to be on top and start being aggressive and start punching Fabrizio over doing exactly what we're doing.

Speaker 8:          01:30:45       Ryan Parsons was talking about when they train ground and pound for ratios, like none of this stuff works on him. Was Guard is so good. He's always like feed on your hips and feet on your shoulders. The one dimensional fighter we already know, they're gone, they're gone. There are retired or any one dimensional and then you've got like two dimensional fighters. There's guys that can have pretty good stand up and there were good wrestlers. Jiu Jitsu ain't that good. Those guys aren't going to last you. That you have to be really good at all aspects of the game. Striking, wrestling, top game, Jujitsu and bottom and game, Jujitsu. You have to be good at all, all those levels. I think in the future right now it's, you know, um, it's, it's not um, a popular view too in the MMA world to really focus and Polish up your bottom game.

Speaker 8:          01:31:34       That's not a thing you want to do because that's like admitting you already lost. That's like admitting that you're wrestling is not going to be good enough admitting that you're not a fucking fierce striker, admitting that you're afraid to stand and strike with someone. That's what a lot of guys, a lot of guys want to go out there and there's Jujitsu guys and there's a bunch of them. I don't want to name names, but a lot of guys go out there. They're Jujitsu world champions and they want to stand and trade. They want to be kickboxers now, you know? And it's of weird. And then, yeah, there's a lot of them and it's, I think this is my experience. I think that to get over that, most Jujitsu fighters, a lot of them generally have a fear of doing standup because they're not that good at it.

Speaker 8:          01:32:14       It's not their sport. Now they're thrust into a kickboxing sport where they're not that good. They spent their whole life on the ground. So there is an element of fear because you can get knocked the fuck out. So to conquer that fear and to fucking Stanwood professional strikers and get some fucking licks in and take the shots, I can see that empowering that and making them feel like a fierce warrior with like, fuck pulling guard. This is awesome. I'm actually standing with professional strikers taking their shit and knocking dudes out every now and then, fuck yeah, I'm standing. I can see them, you know, really liking that rush, you know, that feeling. I conquered fear, you know what I mean? It feels good. Like they don't give a fuck about getting hit. I think it makes them feel good. It's not the best strategy to win a fight, but for their own personal empowerment and it's, I'm sure it's glorious, you know, I can see that.

Speaker 8:          01:33:04       You know when George George l goes out there, he's a black belt in Jujitsu. He fucking loves the trade. He loves that Shit. It makes them feel like a fucking savage, you know? I can see that. I'm like okay, I understand if fucking having a good time. Yeah. Cause that's takes a lot of bottles of the actually do it. It's like base jumping. You know, you can only do that for so long. You can only take so much. It's not easy. It's not an unlimited resource. So back to Damien Maia, I think if you're listening out there, I loved it when he used to pull half guard. If you could take the guy down, take the guy down, stay on top. That's not happening. Maybe it's going to be healthy and fast or one 71 70 or make them faster. Then he said he will not hesitate pulling guard if he can't.

Speaker 8:          01:33:47       If he can't take the guy down, he, he'll try always try to take the guy down. But if he can't, he won't hesitate any. And that gives him a lot of confidence. He talks to me and that gives him conference one way or the other. I'm going to drag the fight to the ground and bring them into my world. No, no longer is he gonna pretend to be a kickboxer. Did you see Brian Ebersol's fight with Tj Walberger? Yes. Yes. Brian Aerosol is hard to choke. Man. That guy's weird. Even though Tj Walberger lost, I think he has a lot of potential and he looked great. He just needs to tighten up a lot of shit to keep going and keep polishing his game. But as guard look dangerous as hell ever saw is really hard to tap. There's something going on with that guy man. Cause like he talks about like the myth of the Guillotine.

Speaker 8:          01:34:29       Like people can't tap him with a good team. You know, I don't know what his deal is. He might have large a orders in his neck or something. Yeah. Or maybe he's just been grappling for so long that he could just fight that shit off. You know? Maybe he knows how to fight that shit off, but he doesn't tap to give teens. He says, he says gay teens are a myth. I wonder if he's a freak. I think Marcello can tap them though. Marcello's he'll give it to you because Marcello's guillotine the Marcella team. I think it's the best choke in the game. It's a May. It's proven. The research is out there. If you really want to find the best choke in the game, you should know as many jokes as possible. But the best one for sure, the research, the evidence, it's all out there.

Speaker 8:          01:35:08       The Marcella tin, the way Marcella does his guillotines study that shit. Cause what is the main difference? He's not choking you like it sound like a blood choke. He's smashing your throat so you tap real quick. They're really quick. Taps is, if you've got a gun arm and guillotine you, you might have to crank it maybe 1520 seconds, maybe 30 seconds. You're twisting and maybe 35 seconds, Bam. He finally gives up in tops. Right. You know the Marcella team comes in a flash, your throat gets smashed and you start tapping. It's a different kind of guillotine. It's the most effective guillotine out there by far. There's it put guys to sleep still, even though it's smashing the throat or is it just all pain? From my experience, people are just tapping from the pain. Huh? Sometimes. But it is kind of a a choke where you can't breathe. Right. You know, you're throwing it to being smashed. You can't breathe. You've got to top quick. So if you can't breathe because your throat, your throat is getting blocked. Do you fall asleep? Maybe you still fall asleep?

Speaker 5:          01:36:04       I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. I, I've, I've never seen a guy who had been more impressed with, with his choke defense than ever saw. He's crazy. Yeah. He doesn't even seem uncomfortable. He just gives, his head, gets all red and he guts it out and then he's on top throwing bombs. It seems like he just, he's really hard to choke. Yeah. He's a warrior man. Tough fucking dude, man. I'm a big fan of Brian ever saw and a guy who's not afraid of getting choked like that, he can put himself into all kinds of weird situations. It's very strange. You know, I'm a fan of anybody who has the balls to throw to just do a cartwheel kit. Oh, you know what I mean? How else people come on. That's, this is the, this is the kick that, uh, people thought it was a fake fight.

Speaker 5:          01:36:42       You know, he got in like a situation when the commission people thought that he had a fake fight. Like it was pro wrestling. Like they didn't believe that you could actually kick somebody like that. That's crazy. That shit has a lot of power. That's like a, a wheel kick ass kick, you know, like, uh, in more powerful than that really, because it's good gravity going in it. What kind of kick? What's it called to cartwheel. Kick cartwheel. Okay. Yeah, that's what I'm, uh, on. Um, Steve Genom, uh, was Harold Howard tried it on Steve Genom. Yeah. But that shit, he came, he left c three was it three came out and cartwheel kicked. It was a legit technique in like a karate point fighting and, and different, you know, I think that was probably like the root of it. It was karate I think was the root of it.

Speaker 5:          01:37:22       But it's, it fucking works, man. If you learn how to do it right, you could nail somebody ever sells knock guys out with it. He tried it. He tried it on a Tj. He's a wild motherfucker. He's got to fight again in Calgary. They just added him onto a, to that car I think. So He'd be fighting like you just a few weeks after his last fight. What do you think about Tito forest? I think it's a good, it's good when guys are, uh, they've had a great careers and they're, you know, probably to the end of those great careers and they're fighting each other. I like that. What, what gets me concerned is when I see like one of these guys that's been in the game a long time is a legend of the game and he's fighting like a top young lion that, that I always feel like, Ooh, I don't really, I don't want to you like those.

Speaker 5:          01:38:13       Yeah. Cause it's like a rocky story. They could pull it out. I remember rocking 65 when it came back. Yes. But there's some guys that, you know, they cross a threshold where you don't want, you don't want to see them get hurt. Like they crossed the threshold where you see them, you know, get laid out a couple of times and you're like, all right, I'm, I'm not really in the scene. This dude get hurt any further. You know, especially by some young killer, you know, you see some, some young dude who just just has lightening fast strikes and just comes in and lights him up. What do you think about young, young Kim and don young and dumb mine? Kim, what do you think? I think Kim is getting really good with his kickboxing is uh, you know, his movement and his feet is way better.

Speaker 5:          01:38:50       Don Young Tim, he's got, um, who did he rock? You rock somebody with a like a jumping front kick to the face and then finished him off. What the fuck was a, I don't remember, but Damien Maia striking is getting better as well. It is not afraid to throw down. Well he and his striking is pretty decent. He hurt. Um, uh, um, uh, Mark Munoz. He tagged Mark Munoz. I think you were really surprised the shit out of them. It's, there's a couple of Brazilians that are turning into illegit Stryker's a Damien Maia and fraud buddies or we're doomed. Yes. Yeah. For breached over doing this crazy watching guys blossom, right? Yeah. He's got a, um, I mean for Reesey over dooms got like a real kickboxing game now. Throws nasty knees, leg kicks. He calmed. I'm that dude with an uppercut, you know, a clean upper cut. He's dangerous guy.

Speaker 5:          01:39:38       That's a big dude, man. When you stand next to Fabricio Werdum his fucking feet are like that big. His hands are, but that's a real heavyweight. He's saying motherfucking hands, you know, and press the fuck out of me, Charles on Olivera man. God Damn, that is a true savage. Right. Then Sean Pearson was the guy that don't young Kim hit with a jumping front kick in the face and Sean Pearson's fucking good man. And you know he's, he's got a victory over Nate Diaz. He's got a victory over a mirror set. Dolla. He's fucking good man. Don Young Kim is good and he's no joke and he's not scared to go to the ground either. He's strong as fuck. He's a really good judo guy. Real good defense. You know, so cause he'd be, it could be or it could be a submission man. It could be a submission. They could go to the ground and Danny Meyer might just lock them up and one 70 if he can come in healthy, you know, if he weighs like a healthy one 85 one 90 or something, come fight time.

Speaker 5:          01:40:31       That's going to be weird to say. But how old is Damien? He's probably in his mid thirties probably 30 to 35 or something like that. I should find out before I talk a lot about, cause that has an effect also on cutting a big amount of weight this late in your career. It's going to be interesting to see what it looks like it's sending. I'm sure he's a smart guy though. If he's doing anything, I'm sure that he's doing it the right way. 34 if he's doing anything, you know he spends a lot of time training with a lot of wrestlers and I'm, I'm sure they're going to give him like the exact right way to do it and you know he's not, he's such a bright guy. I would assume that he would absolutely do it the correct way and he would only not, I mean it must have made some, some test runs, but I, I have a split feelings on shit like that.

Speaker 5:          01:41:15       I just think it's so unhealthy when dudes cut a shit load of weight. I was just like, man, I don't think you should cut that much weight. It's so crazy. It's so, it just seems so unhealthy. It seems like there's a point of diminishing return than a lot of guys cross over. You know, I think you get to around like eight, 10 pounds, five pounds, something like that. That's nothing. That's good. That's fine. That's fine. That's barely even gonna hurt you. You're going to be fine. You know, you, you go back and refuel. But when dudes are cut in 25, 30 pounds like there, Anthony Johnson and that it coming in like weighing almost 200 pounds and they're finding it one 70. That's of crazy. It's weird. It's like, how do you, uh, how do you f how do you stop that though? How do you tell people that they, uh, they can't do that anymore?

Speaker 5:          01:41:58       Well, if you can make it, then that's your spot. Yeah. You know, that's where they should be. If you could make it, that's your spot. I know, but what a weird way to do business. Like everybody has to almost kill themselves the day before we're going to fight. Everybody has to literally starve to the point where you're really unhealthy. Look terrible. There's a lot of guys to step on the scale 24 hours before a big fight and they don't look good at all. You know, it's crazy. Who knows that more than you? Yeah. Or there's guys like Bj Penn who would choose to fight at one 70 and he doesn't even really weigh one seven he would weigh like one 66 you know, and Bj fought like Matt Hughes, I think he was like one 66 he's been as low as like one 64 and he's fighting welterweights you know, is this that way to do it too.

Speaker 5:          01:42:44       I mean, Frankie Edgar one lightweight title, you know, that way by being a real hundred 55 pound dude fighting dudes who are, you know, probably like one 75 maybe come python maybe even. Yeah, I mean gray Maynard was a big dude. He's thick as fuck man. You know, I don't know how much great cuts, but he looks big. He's like, gets to be two 30 during off season. It didn't like Oberg said he gets to like 200 or something though. He's been to probably probably like Joe Stevenson used to hover around 200 for launch. She cut down to 55 same thing with Chris Brennan. Did you see Joe Stevenson? He left the EOC and they just lost that dude, Dakota Cochran, the guy who had been in a, he had like some sort of a career and a gay porn. He thought Justin Lin said yeah. Undercard and you know, you don't know this whole thing about tough.

Speaker 5:          01:43:36       Yeah, he was on the ultimate fighter and he had a, it needed some money in this past. So he did some gay porn and they let him on the show. Okay. And I thought that was a, I thought that was cool. I was like, alright. You know, like why not man let the kid on the show, why wouldn't you let him on the show? Isn't a show all about like trying to get your shit together. I mean, how many of the guys that are on the show have been in jail? How many of you guys on the jail, the show been in jail for assault? Is it had been any, I don't know. It might not been any. It probably wouldn't allow you to do. Right. They'd probably like make sure that they didn't get responsible for anybody. That was dangerous. I don't even know the answer to that question, but, so the dude had a little prominence past.

Speaker 5:          01:44:13       It's in the past now. Unfortunately. This is a video of it and they let him on the show. Oh, I think that's cool. But he didn't make it and he lost. But he's good man. He's fucking good. He's real good. He beat Joseph. Fuck Joe Daddy up, dude. Fuck Joe Daddy upstanding then caught them on the ground and got them in a rear naked and finished him. Wow, dude. And he had, he had his back a couple of times. He fucked Joe up, man. He's good. He's good. He's explosive. He's really fast. Who did he lose two on the ultimate fighter? I don't know, Brian. All right. Sure.

Speaker 3:          01:44:41       He may have gotten hurt. I think he, I think you're right. Yeah. I think you're right. Maybe it's the last season, right? Yeah, because I saw the last season. It was good. Yeah. I don't know what the fuck happened to him. So we should look it up.

Speaker 5:          01:44:56       Are Chryslers and the show starts tonight at nine. We're talking about it and my son trip flip. He's watching right now. He says he's a sweetie. I'm trying to find out

Speaker 3:          01:45:10       what about, so all of a sudden, what do you think we think's going? Go down. I mean anything could happen really. We can see the exact same fight again and this time son and pulls it off and stays out of trouble. Um, or maybe Anderson Silva has got to the point where it's really hard to take down now it's not, it's having a hard time taking her down. Maybe it takes them down once or twice, but it's the third round and he's having a hard time. He's forced to strike with silver and silver. It takes them apart. Or we could see Chael Sonnen hurting Silva standing and then gone right through them. Anything could fucking happen. You just don't know. You know, who knows? Maybe sun and takes. So the down immediately and silver comes after him with an incredible guard. He just, instead of like being cautious, like he wasn't in his last find me through that triangle up in the fifth round, like go after him right away. We might see that and he might fucking tap them in a triangle and 30 seconds. It could, anything could happen. It's who the fuck knows this Dakota Cochran Dude.

Speaker 5:          01:46:07       Uh, he came in as a late replacement against Jamie Varner and dominated Jamie Varner and a titan fighting championships. Guess he, uh, he went to a decision over him there and then he lost on the ultimate fighter or some dude named James Vick. He lost a victim. Vic, a split decision. This was his Wikipedia. He performed in 16 videos under the stage name. Danny fully disclosed this information to the UFC. So the FCC said whatever. They're probably loving it just for the, just for the interesting angle, but the dude can fight, forget about all that. He can fight his ass off. Jamie Varner Neb justice

Speaker 3:          01:46:46       blows up. There's going to be getting out of their sections when Armenian fighter fights,

Speaker 8:          01:46:50       there's a section and there all Armenians, right. You know what I mean? There's going to be gay sections probably. That'd be awesome, dude. I think to do it straight though, you only did it for money. I'll come on. Well that's, that's what he says, but for sure he has it for sure. He has a big gay following for sure. For sure. And Dude, what if they show up in droves? That'd be awesome. Would have gay dudes started entering into fighting because he's game might have more anger than your average to all that shit

Speaker 5:          01:47:17       might be a real mind fuck for a straight dude. Get beat up by a gay guy. Like that might be a mind fuck. Like not only does this guy beat my ass, he could fuck me and he might want to. Yeah. You know? Yup. Yeah. I mean maybe that would have worked for him. You know,

Speaker 8:          01:47:30       for a lot of dudes it probably would for a lot of dudes, he probably would. You know, when he gets your back, that's real. Yeah. There's gotta be a stylus. There's gotta be a style out there specifically for anal rape. You know what I mean? That's the best Jujitsu for sure. You'd have to have a base in Jujitsu, but it'd get technical because you'd, you'd have to pan the arms a certain way. Pennants needs a certain way to, to get penetration. It's totally different drug to hold them in place. That would be, but it could be like a, like cop tactics, like police tactics where there's Jujitsu in there, but they got the baton, they got something else going on, they got handcuffed them. So maybe you don't have to handcuff him first. You have to handcuffs upbeat ideas. That's, it seems like a really easiest way, right

Speaker 5:          01:48:15       person. Why are you even bring that up? What a terrible thing to do to a person that's, that's definitely not using martial arts for good. Yes, you're right. I forgot fucked up. I'm sorry. Have you seen this thing? I'm going to change gears completely about, um, these, um, things that they found, these portals and the universe, he's hidden portals between the earth and the sun. They're totally confused, but there some sort of a guide or a shortcut and there's an opening in the space or time fields. Yeah, yeah. Whoa. Yeah. Tweet that shit. Yeah, it's NASA. It's a NASA funded researcher and plasma physicist, Jack Scooter of the University of Iowa claims. He has figured out a way to find them and they're called x points or electron diffusion regions. And so there's, there's, you know, the idea is that there's pathways and our galaxy, our galaxy isn't just, it's not just like, you know, you have to go from here to there. No, you can, you can actually go in this thing and it might take you somewhere else. Like, like, like a real wormhole. You imagine if we find other wormholes are just like tunnels that just exist all over the place and you know how you get, you know, just drive through the tunnel. Well, you could just go through the wormhole and that's what you do whip and you're on the other side.

Speaker 8:          01:49:42       Yeah, man. How about, how about that? Have you seen a documentary as the ultimate stoner response and

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       Morrison did it, did you ever, do you know anything about the Coral Castle in Florida? Yes, I did. Made some crazy castle. Brian pulled this up because I don't understand the science of it and I'm sure I'm butchering it. It's NASA discovers hidden portals in space and put that it's on youtube and they'll, it'll explain it like NASA discovers hidden portals in space and it's on a, on Youtube, so it'll explain better what they mean by portals. But what I'm, the way I'm saying, and I'm sure I'm fucking it up, and in my rudimentary understanding of it, it means that you know, the universe is not just one flat sort of, it's not, it's not the same everywhere. There's a little pathways and shit. There's a little, there's things that exist that, you know, not just black holes but other things that will take you through to somewhere else, which is kind of nuts. I mean, some day, some future generation of ours might be able to actually traverse something like that. You know what I mean? It's really crazy to wrap your head around that. We might figure it out one day how to navigate through the universe and fucking go through an actual portal into another place and it it's hard to wrap your head around. Yeah, man. I mean just basic shit like the earth magnetic field, you know, and that there are certain points on the planet, whether there's hyper activity

Speaker 9:          01:51:12       presented by science at NASA. That guy sounds like he gets no pussy. Bedford theme of science fiction is the portal an extroardinary opening in space or time that connects travelers to distant realms. A good portal is a shortcut, a guide, a door into the unknown if only they actually existed. It turns out that they do sort of, and a NASA funded researcher at the University of Iowa has figured out how to find them. We call them x points or electron diffusion regions explains Plasma Physicist Jack's gutter of the University of Iowa. They're places where the magnetic field of earth connects to the magnetic field of the sun, creating an uninterrupted path leading from our own planet to the sun's atmosphere. 93 million miles away. Observations by Nassis Themis spacecraft and Europe's cluster probes suggest that these magnetic portals open and close dozens of times each day. They're typically located a few tens of thousands of kilometers from Earth with the geomagnetic field meets the onrushing solar wind.

Speaker 9:          01:52:21       Most portals are small and short lived. Others are yawning. Vast and sustained energetic particles can flow through the openings, heating Earth's upper atmosphere, sparking geomagnetic storms and igniting bright polar Aurora's NASA is planning a mission called MMS. Short form magnetospheric multiscale mission due to launch in 2014 just study the phenomenon bristling with energetic particle detectors and magnetic sensors. The force spacecraft of MMS will spread out in Earth's magnetosphere and surround the portals to observe how they work. Just one problem finding them. Magnetic portals are invisible, unstable, and elusive. They open and close without warning and there are no signposts to guide us in notes. Scutter actually, there are signposts and Scutter has found them. Portals form via the process of magnetic reconnection mingling lines of magnetic force from the Sun and Earth Crisscross Kross and join to create the openings. X points are where the crisscross takes place.

Speaker 9:          01:53:32       The sudden joining of magnetic fields can propel jets of charged particles from the x point creating an electron diffusion region to learn how to pinpoint these events. Scutter looked at data from a space probe that orbited earth more than 10 years ago. In the late 1990s NASA's polar spacecraft spent years in Earth's magnetosphere, explained Scutter and it encountered many x points during its mission because polar carried sensors similar to those of MMS, Scutter decided to see how an x point looked to polar using polar data. We have found five simple combinations of magnetic field and energetic particle measurements that tell us when we've come across an x point or an electron diffusion region, a single spacecraft properly instrumented can make these measurements. This means that a single member of the MMS constellation using the diagnostics can find a portal and alert other members of the constellation, our mission planners. Von Thought that MMS might have to,

Speaker 5:          01:54:35       if you want to hear the whole thing, go online and check because I'm sure most of us are not absorbing that. We're going to have to go back and listen to that and, and, and, and read the paperwork on it. But that sounds fucking crazy. Finding new things like that in space. It's like weird. It's so weird. Like the idea that we already figured out what was out there up, there's some new shit. Oh, here's some, here's some invisible magnetic portal. OOPS, here's some new shit. Did you hear about this? A new civilization they discovered that lived, uh, 8,000, 500 years ago, uh, somewhere near Spain. They found an underwater, they have, um, like pottery, all kinds of shit. Apparently this area used to be, um, used to be above ground, like, uh, between, uh, and somewhere between 11,000 and 6,000 years ago, it's slowly sank away and they, uh, they've recovered like human bones and pottery.

Speaker 5:          01:55:28       It seems like every other month there's some new groundbreaking discovery that pushes back the date of civilization. It's amazing. You know, this go Beckley Tampa Bay was like the first big one and now they're always in like they found these concentric rings in the, in the ocean floor that they believe is Atlantis. And I think that's somewhere around Spain and how there's, there's, there's all sorts of speculation that there might have been a fuck load of civilizations that were like really, you know, pretty advanced for the time and we were living right by the water and they're gone now the water level changed. What do you think about that Baltic Sea to sponsor? There is just a rock crusher. It's Iraq if you look into it. Yeah, I haven't seen any photos that make me think it's anything other than weird rocks, rocks or whatever's going down there and trying to fuck with it and then turned power shuts off twice.

Speaker 5:          01:56:21       Yeah, it could be their equipment sucks at high depth. You know, it could be the pressure of the equipment, equipment failed. Sometimes people look for Shit to be like something crafting. I would love it if it was something crafty, but I saw the pictures of me like that shit looks like rocks man. They're like, well there's a pearl necklace. It's like scattered rocks. Like you guys are like reaching like this is just rocks. I mean, maybe when you're down there looking at it eye to eye, it looks different and maybe there's some shit that they haven't been able to photograph yet. The ones you see, you'd go, oh, whoa, whoa, Whoa, Whoa, this is a fucking, somebody made this. Maybe it's possible. But, um, most, most of the time I think there's plenty of shit out there that they could be looking at are faking their enthusiasm.

Speaker 5:          01:57:03       They're like way, no, they're enthusiastic. It doesn't mean, you know, I dunno. I Dunno. I Dunno if they're, they're looking to see something. I don't know if what they can actually see as much cooler than the shit they've shown us. The shit that they've shown us is like, you see like this big rock and I don't know why we're supposed to think that's special, you know? But why rock sometimes forming weird forms. You know, Graham Hancock said it's just a rock. That's what his real, his assessment of it was because a peculiarly or rock, that's what he believes it is. But you know, this is just the beginning of data. No one knows. But the people who were down there staring at it, you know, it might be aliens vs Predator fucking temple and we just a cocky civilization that used to be above water. It could be, yeah. Yeah. I mean how much would be left of something? It was underwater for 30,000 years under the ocean. How much of that chickens jam? It's like part of some Russian experiment or something. Yeah. Maybe it's a troll. Two big troller.

Speaker 3:          01:58:02       No, no, no. I mean like uh, some vessel that the Russians were fucking with like 30 years ago and, right, right.

Speaker 5:          01:58:08       I don't think so. I think they're saying it's a stone. It's a stone structure, whatever it is, natural structure, whatever it is. I believe they're saying it's stolen. I think there's just some quick Yuliar like pathways in it and stuff like that. Just put, it could be just some weird ass dog

Speaker 3:          01:58:22       that into it. I just saw at like maybe a five minute news clip on the latest dive and they said they went down to power. All the power goes off. Then they went back. Sounds awesome. I was going to write a script. That's what I would write. If it was like one of the guys was the biggest skeptic papa bought. Now he's he, he can't explain it. He doesn't, he doesn't want to make a statement,

Speaker 8:          01:58:42       but he's saying this is not normal.

Speaker 5:          01:58:44       What is the latest one was the last time it was a news report. Yeah, look at it. That's this Baltic Ufo news report. Yeah. What's interesting is it's so sexy to want to want to think. This is from some other planet. You know? It's so intriguing. If we really imagine if we really found a fucking ship at the bottom of the ocean and it was just dressed up like a rock, because that's what you would do. If you want it to hide your ship, you make it look like a fucking rock. I mean they're aliens. They can come here from another planet and it has to look like a ship. It's so stupid. Maybe they made a fucking alien spacecraft that looks like rocks, so when it's on the bottom, it's just chilling like a rock. Of course they should be able to alter their environment or the way they're, they look to their environment.

Speaker 5:          01:59:30       So maybe that's what it is. I would love that. That's the best thing. That would be the most, the most fun new story that would change the world. But I'm not convinced. New dive details. Photos. See this look for the new story. Yeah. There's some photos that uh, Brian, can you find it to show the rocks? Well, it's like a BBC thing maybe. Yeah. I mean it shows it's, it's, it's interesting man. It's so, you know, hopefully it's something, but it might be bullshit. It might totally be a natural thing telling me their equipment might suck. Who knows? But like I said, it's sexy to think that it's not, the whole idea of Ufo was the sexiest Yo, this the sexiest idea that there's actually going to be something you would forget your bills. Forget what the fuck is on TV. Even if it was like the final season premiere of the game of Thrones, you know? Yeah. In the last days in first episode, you know, final season premier league, uh, still dude take seeing a Ufo. Remember

Speaker 8:          02:00:29       if I remember correctly, and I could be wrong about David Eick like in his, in the beginning of his career as being like a dude who lectures on Illuminati type stuff. He said some shit about reptilians and then a lot of people turned, uh, that turned them off. They're like, Fuck David. I cause that Reptilian Guy, he loses me when he talks about reptilians. So then it seemed like he stopped talking about Reptilians for awhile, but recently I just saw this seminar he did and he gets in depth about rope tows. He says that all the world leaders have are being controlled. Does David Ike I just saw this last week are being controlled by Reptilians that are on a different frequency and there are around them controlling them. You just can't see them. They're actually controlling the world leaders. That's what he thinks. And he's talking about this in his lecture. That's amazing.

Speaker 5:          02:01:21       Amazing that he can do this. Yeah. Um, I think, uh, I think he's an entertainer. That's what I think part of what he does is he's an entertainer. Yeah. I think he's a, he's a lot like, uh, there's a few other guys that I don't, I don't buy a for a second. He's one of them. I think he's got some really good valid

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       that he mixes in with some crazy shit and he creates, he creates like a whole cottage industry. That's what I think. Alex Jones, Alex Jones was totally against David Eick for a while because of the reptilian thing. It totally against them. And then he actually became friends with David Eick and he doesn't really want to get into it. He says, he says that the reptilian thing makes more sense to them now and they're cool now. They hated each other. They said, talk shit on and shuttle. You know? Now they're cool. They've been cool for a though, you know Jones is a big sweetie. Yeah. That's the reality. The reality is Alex Jones is always a big sweetie. Yeah. He's one of the cool, clearly as fuckers, I hang out with a really nice guy. You know, people would never believe it. If you watch his doom and gloom and how crazy is it that we've partied with him in Vegas and got hammered with a hammer and had a great time with him.

Speaker 1:          02:02:33       He's an awesome guy and he is not a bad dude man. He just gets all worked up and he loves talking. You know even when the cameras are off he can talk all that conspiracy talk non stop non 24 hours and you're never gets tired of it. I love hearing it. I got Alex Jones sitting next to me at Wolf Gang. Puck Illuminati, the situation he was brought in by Kennedy in the sixties 1961 operation. Thundercat. He'll come up with fucking hit you with some shit and you're like what? But a lot of what he's saying is right. I love Alex Jones, man. I love his shit. You can't be right all the time. Everyone's wrong. And sometimes he's wrong about shit. You don't discount all the fucking beautiful info that he has after it. Yeah, he's going to miss a lot. You know, you know, if you're going to judge someone on being wrong about this or that cause he was wrong about y two k you can't there, everyone's wrong about some shit.

Speaker 1:          02:03:32       You can't be right about everything. Well, it's the doom and gloom guys. There's a certain amount of entertainment to it. You got it. You got to recognize that much like Fox News has committed itself to being conservative. You know, he has committed himself to a doom and gloom and to a certain extent, that's the problem that I had with Rupert Murdoch. Rupert Murdoch, let them know Michael Rupert, when Michael Gruber was, was on the show and he would alternate between thinking that it was going to be the end of the world or thinking that people were going to pull it together. And I think that you can get caught up in thinking that it's going to, everything's going to fucking fall apart. You can get caught up in that. It's really easy. It's really easy to just a side. It's all coming to an end. It's so easy to do, you know? And I think, uh, you get caught up in that the whole world is corrupt and this doom and gloom everywhere and you, you caught up in that whole Alex Jones conspiracy mentality and well a lot of it's fucking real man. It's true. We don't live in, we don't live in a society where the government is all about the people. We don't whether you want to believe it or not. The way I look at it is I'm not going go out there and pick

Speaker 8:          02:04:37       it shit. You know, who knows. Maybe I'll change my mind a bit effects if something happens that affects me personally. Maybe I'll be out there with a picket, but one thing we can all do is we can all use Twitter or Facebook just to make people aware. I think everybody is aware and that's just from Twitter and from Facebook. If they're aware of what's going on, I think slowly we change. Yeah. Because I really think that, you know, there's, there is light at the end of the tunnel from all these conspiracy theories and all that shit. I think that there is hope that if the everybody was aware, and today more than anybody, any other time in history, more people are aware that the government is fucking them than ever before because of the Internet. So I just think, let's just keep making people aware.

Speaker 8:          02:05:22       Just keep pounding them over the head with the information. Look at the studies, look at this, look what they're doing. And if we have it, some people just do not want to believe that the government doesn't have our best interest. You know, they don't want to believe that they get angry. If you bring it up there, you don't have any proof. That's not proof. You know, there's 1500 engineers and architects that are banded together. They've, they've gone out of their way banning together saying, dude, Tyler seven was demoed. I mean, the banding together and what people say, you know, how many architects there are, there's fucking hundreds of thousands, so 1500 got together. You know what I mean? If 1500 architects got together and petitioned and said, this house is condemned, it's going to fall apart. It's dangerous. Would you say? Uh, it's only 1500 architects. There's 100,000 of them. No, you'd go, you'd wait a minute. I'm not moving into that motherfucker. That's it.

Speaker 5:          02:06:16       So kind of an unfair comparison because you're talking about a public event and when you talk about a public event of the entire world saw this one public event, so you're dealing with millions and millions and millions and millions of millions of people to get 1500 that think there's something going on like a Texan engineers. I'm just saying 1500 crazy people is not unlikely. I agree. Obviously I've always agreed. Is something wrong with that, that thing, it fell down like a controlled demolition. It's weird. It's weird that that doesn't freak people out. And it's weird that you can't sue the fuck out of someone who built a building for you and it catches on fire.

Speaker 8:          02:06:49       Just fucking kill the houses. The former head of star wars is coming out making some serious allegations. The dig chick, former head of star wars, is he a scientist? He's a bunch of show. He's coming out and saying that prop based on the evidence based on all the Shitty knows about, uh, nine 11, based on all that shit he thinks it looks like it's probably Dick Cheney was running all this shit. Wow. He's, that's what he's saying. He said Dick Cheney

Speaker 5:          02:07:19       and he shot first forehead of the Star Wars Program says Cheney may nine, 11, suspect official version of events. A conspiracy theory says drills were to cover for attacks. The drills were covered for attacks. The former head of star wars missile defense under presidents Ford and Carter has gone public to say that the official version of the nine 11 conspiracy, it's a conspiracy theory and his main suspect for the architect of the attacks is Vice President Dick Cheney. Whoa. That's fucking shit. You get murdered over. Wow. People get murdered for way less because it is funny though that people don't want to hear that. It is funny that Pete, this is something the anger people read about his background. Is He legit? Oh yes. It's a legit guy. Yeah, he's 100% legit. He was the head of Star Wars. Star Wars is a very interesting program, and I think we've talked about this on the podcast before, but star wars scientists have been murdered like a, a great number of them.

Speaker 8:          02:08:11       Yeah. Yeah. I mean here, here we go, conspiracy guys to deny the nine 11 shit. The head of Star Wars is saying it was all bullshit. That kid a fucking star wars. God Damn, and you're still going to deny it. Well, there's so much evidence, right?

Speaker 5:          02:08:26       But in all fairness, he's a scientist and he could be some crazy left winger. And just because he's a genius scientist doesn't mean he's not.

Speaker 8:          02:08:35       Yeah, but where people always talk about credibility, if they, if they would say if some, if they, if there was some guy on the street and said, I saw bombs. I heard bombs go off. They call. He's just some dude on the street. Now we've got former head of star wars that he could be crazy. You can't just, at some point you got to go, God dammit. At some point you got to go. Of course it's fishy. Of course there's people banning together.

Speaker 5:          02:08:58       22 star wars researchers, all committed suicide, 22 all committed to this. Yeah, of course. Nice. Amazing. Well there's, I'll, I'll deal with the, you know, the, the thing was, the idea was the conspiracy theory was that the star wars program was bullshit and it was never worked. And they never had some real missile defense shield that they get shoot and space knock fucking missiles out of the sky or staples. They never developed that level of technology. So they had sort of hide the fact that it was a big giant money grab. They tried to look into it, Congress approved that whoever the fuck approved did they look into it and then it just started stealing money. So all these scientists that were involved in this, that knew it was horse shit. They just knock them all off. That's the kind of money that you're dealing with.

Speaker 5:          02:09:44       You're dealing with the kind of money that can kill 22 researchers, allegedly, allegedly. Yeah. Sounds about right. Right. Crazy. Totally believable. The, I'm the witnesses of the Kennedy assassination. This is a, a new, uh, video that, uh, what is his nickname on youtube? Mr Brick? Maker 37 is uh, he's uh, the Tangerine show or Tangerine show rather on Twitter. He made this video and in the video he talked about it was a clip of us on the podcast talking about the witnesses to the Kennedy assassination and how many witnesses died. Uh, because of their, they were murdered car accidents, electrocution suicide got hit by trains. Like crazy amount of them died in a documentary about this. And then they sent the, uh, they did their, their calculation

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       was that the odds of all of these people who had witnessed this one event getting murdered or were killed in accidents in such a short period of time was one in something trillion to one. Yeah, that shit over as one point. Something over and over again. All that shit. People don't want to guys are paranoid. I'm proud. It's, it's a sexy idea. But Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. They've already proven you could shoot that rifle. There's that certain sort of delusional, conservative sort of Patriot type radio guide voice that they do where you're talking nonsense. They've uh, they've all filled out the dossier. It's all completed. Sorry. Sorry. Hippies. Sorry. Okay. Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Thank you. That's scary shit man. But these are like in mindset and they want to lock into an ideology. We figure out how much evidence would it take to take like the biggest, uh, debunker dude take it.

Speaker 1:          02:11:37       How much evidence will it take? Will it if they, if like Dick Cheney came out and admitted it when they, they've got no Dick Cheney, he lost his mind with that new heart. A new arts are liars. Hearts. Yes, exactly. People would believe that shit. Of course it would. A lot of people would. Well, there's a lot of people that want to believe that the governments, their daddy government's gonna take care of them, I think. I think if everyone consciously tried to make all their friends aware of the truth, look into it. People are constantly looking, doing I cabi Vasquez, I was with him last week. We were in El Paso doing a Gracie nationals tournament and he just recently started looking into conspiracy theories and it's like changed his, uh, he kept going on and on and how it's changed his life and his wages and you just actually got to look into it, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:12:25       Well, people can spire. I mean, if people don't believe that, this is my question, that I always say, do you believe in nine 11? Do you believe nine 11 happened? Well, if you do, that's a conspiracy isn't, it? Isn't a conspiracy, didn't they? These guys can spire to make that happen. Do you believe that the Japanese attacked World War II? They attacked to a Pearl Harbor? Well then you believe in conspiracy theories because the Japanese conspired to sneak attack with jets and bomb the fuck out of people. That's real. Like they, they really plan that out, you know? Do you believe that Hitler burned the right stack to, to get people to think that the, you know, that the Nazis were under attack? Do you believe that Nero burned Rome? Do you believe in any of these crazy? We then you believe in conspiracies, man, they, they're documented throughout history. People have been conspiring it bullshit and forever men, they've always done it. They always will if they can get away with it to pull it off. A bunch of evil fucks work together. They know each other real well. They partied together, they kill hookers together and they get together and go, you know what? Why are we fucking playing by the rules here? Well let's just rob these pitches. Let's rob these bitches. And they lost touch knuckles and they go after it and they, they, they pay money to get lobbyists to change laws to

Speaker 5:          02:13:32       make it easier for them to fucking move money around and they just, they keep that party rolling and they leave so much evidence land around. It doesn't matter. It doesn't pass it matter. Well in this day and age, I think it started a matter. I think what's going on now with the Internet is that young people coming up with the, a realization of how the system works. A realization of just human life in general. When I say the system, a realization of countries and taking other other countries' resources in the hall, it's the people that are coming up. It's going to be way harder for the children of the people that live today to justify the way the world runs in the future because all this information will be out there. Whereas when we were kids, when I was growing up in the 1970s there was no, there was no information about any of this.

Speaker 5:          02:14:15       We never had any idea how the fucking world war and he had to go to a library. If you wanted to get information and you had to find the right book and who knows what that book is even right. You could even fact check it. You know? It was difficult to find out what the fuck was going on, but now pretty much anybody with a phone has instant access to almost any answer to any question they have or at least reasonable, you know, to a reasonable extent. That's going to change everything, man. I think we're just seeing it right now. We're the beginning of the wave. I think the wave behind us is the wave that can't be ignored. There's going to be a group of people that know everything. They have all the information. It's not like your regular person that lived in the 1970s that went to school for a certain thing and then live in a certain neighborhood.

Speaker 5:          02:14:56       Now you're going to be influenced by all the humans all over the planet all the time and that's what's going on right now with Twitter. That's what's going on right now with this fucking podcast. That's what's going on right now with Facebook. That's what's going on right now with anybody that starts their own podcasts and anybody who starts their own message board and anybody that starts their own thing where they're reaching out and communicating with people and other people lock into it and next thing you know, you got your own little online party going on, man. You got your own little online party going on. That's never existed. No one has ever had that sort of an openness in the past before to open access to information in the past before, we've never been able to just communicate with people like this. So we're going to get to know each other more in the next hundred years than we have in the last million years. We're going to get to know how we handle the real, raw fucking truth of everything. Because in the wild, there's going to be no more secrets. You're not gonna be able to hide money. You're not going to be able to hide where resources are coming from. You're not to be able to hide anything. Everybody's going to know exactly what's going on all the time, and that's when we're going to have to either get our shit together as a species or start using these fucking bombs we've been storing up. It's one or the other

Speaker 5:          02:16:10       when they see guys like Brian.

Speaker 6:          02:16:13       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:16:14       they see this as part of the problem. When we were talking about, I dunno, I'm talking about a bad guys going after you to protect freedom. Freedom. Are you worried about terrorist attacks? You ever think about it? Anything can happen, Bro. Shit, they already, of

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       course. Yeah. I mean, anything could happen if they do it. Really? Or did it go down as the head of Star Wars says, and there's a fucking Dick Cheney who knows exactly how it went down. Add that to the checklist. I thought I shut it off. I swear to God. Ladies and gentlemen, we've been doing so many shows to the other studio. I'm more concerned about bad Sushi than I am about terrorism.

Speaker 4:          02:16:53       I had bad Sushi and I ruined my day, my fucking weak. But I think about that more than I think about like, oh no, my, this plane's going to go down, you know, or, um, I don't think people worry about it. It's going to happen to them personally, the odds, but another terrorist attack for sure. It's going to keep happening. Unless Bryce listeners to just shelter world. I'm worried about boots. Sue. She's so silly and everybody gets food poisoning ever again. That ain't shit. I'm scared. People in Iraq eat food poisoning for breakfast. Okay. That's what I have for breakfast every day. Do, man, you're lucky. You're lucky. You live here in America. You've got to roll the dice. He not living in fucking taboo. You know, living in Pakistan, launching missiles from the sky with drones. See Florida says that they're going to have the most drones out of any, every, any state because was just crazy.

Speaker 4:          02:17:44       Is it that that's a reality. It's a weird word. Was going to do. Again, what are they going to keep track out things, photograph. Things are going to be in the, in the sky in case we ever need them. Like say if there's some sort of a high speed pursuit that drones will be able to follow you from the sky and for sure drones are going to be above you. If you plan on doing any speeding, go kiss that shake of it. There's no more speeding because there's going to be drones that are going to monitor your speed and then they get an alert the police to where you are and the police are going to cut you off. I can't wait till people start hacking these. The good, you know that's, it's going to happen. Well, that's what happened. And I ran, you know, pack it in Texas.

Speaker 4:          02:18:20       Yeah. They can hack a man. It's, it's a real problem. It's going to be a real, it's a radio frequency man. Some super genius due to smarter than you who wouldn't be working for the government is going to figure out a way to fuck with that shit. Yeah. There's Jones be acting a fool any like just a day after they released those things. Yeah. I wonder how crackable they are, but I've got to assume that anything that's uh, using radio frequency is you gotta be able to crack that. They're going to figure out how the would, the frequency one is going to fall on a child and that it's just going to be, well it already has in Pakistan, if, you know, if you're in a, if you're in Pakistan, you're walking with your kid is no guarantee that you're not going to get hit with a missile.

Speaker 4:          02:18:55       You know, that's, that's real. You know, they're fucking firing missiles from the sky and we're not even like really officially over there, cause we're not over. There are robots were over there shooting fire from the sky like fucking hell man. It's amazing where we are. Terminators happening for them. When you were a kid, you remember watching terminator, you imagine watching that was it. Which one was one where they uh, the things were flying in the air and they were shooting down. Was that the first terminator two was it terminates Judgment Day? Is that what it was?

Speaker 6:          02:19:24       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:19:25       It's going on right now. Blade runner. Runner. We're

Speaker 5:          02:19:28       right in it. There's drones. It's fucking drunk. Slide around. What the fuck? That was pretty fucking quick. They just appeared. Yeah. They said they're going to be 30,000 of them in the country within 10 years, but we need anonymous on that fucking route. He's going to be a mass. Well they got rid of those traffic cameras. Have you noticed that those traffic cameras to take pictures of you going through the yellow light or red box to have him? They got rid of them. Yeah. They got rid of them cause I said, I think they're unconstitutional. I think there's something about them that's a, that's illegal. I think it's because it's a private company that put them up and the private companies somehow or another was profiting off of these, uh, people getting photographed going through red lights and someone, someone questioned it. I'm doing a terrible job of butchering the, uh, the argument or the story, but rather, but, uh, I think that's what happened.

Speaker 5:          02:20:20       Do you have any problem with Johan and on me? No, man. That was just a very disjointed podcast today. We really didn't get it together ever for ever more than 10 minutes at a time. Next time we got to stop at like two hits. I think two weeks is good on one. There's two joints. We did smoke too much. We went, we went to crazy D's. I apologize. Yeah. Well that's why I wasn't even upset at Brian for, for logging into the beginning part. You were so stolen. You didn't know what the fuck you're doing. I don't even know what was going on. You silly bitch. You didn't know what the fuck was going on. Yeah. There's a, there's a certain level where you really shouldn't be talking into a microphone in front of thousands of people when you get high guy was that was that level.

Speaker 5:          02:21:01       Like right now we're perfect right now we can cook with gas down. This a fucking portal thing is so confusing to me. All this space stuff is so confusing to me because I keep wanting to be the skeptic. I keep wanting to be the guy and he's like, nothing's going to happen now. They're going to happen. I wasn't going to happen. It's just life's going to be the same. They'll discover a new planet. You can't see it. Who gives a fuck? Yeah. The thing's going to happen. Let's get video of that. Yeah, and the creatures on it. That's how discovery channel's about other planets. I mean, how fucking cool. We're so, you know, we have like, we're so impatient when it comes to, you know, discoveries and things, we want it all to happen like all at once. Like when we look back in time, it like what Galileo, it figured out or Copernicus had figured out.

Speaker 5:          02:21:46       I mean it's all stuff that pretty much everybody knows now, but back then it was just mind blowing revelations about the nature of the universe. Now if you look at what like we know now, you know our little baby ass is known now and what they're going to know. If we could just keep it together for a hundred years just to keep it together for a hundred years. Yeah, there's going to be some crazy shit going on. Thinking about a hundred wasn't 19, 12. How much cocked did it suck in 1912. It was terrible. The cars were dog shit. If they even existed, they were dog shit. You're riding around on dirt roads. Everybody stays. Thought it was cool that we get that cars for the first time. They're like, Holy Shit, this is the most amazing part of life here. If we're not the edge of the edge of technology, we have, cars are going to think back about us in 2000 years.

Speaker 5:          02:22:33       Like, oh, they didn't have hologram vaginas. I think it's going to be, uh, you know, we were always like looking for alien life and we're always saying like, we can't search alien life. I don't think we're ready yet. And I think because we're not ready yet because we're not really quite smart enough to tune in to whatever the fuck their frequency they're on, you know, wherever they are because of that. That's why there's no evidence, even though it makes sense. I think we're going to come to a point at a certain time where if our technology expands and continues to expand, it's going to get to a point where there's no spot in the universe that we can't traverse. I mean, ultimately, if people live for a million years, that's got to happen. I mean, what we can do today is impossible. Well, we can do in a thousand years from now is going to be equally impossible to us today.

Speaker 5:          02:23:19       You know, everything that's so normal, like Wifi and cellular videos and texting people pictures of your butt hole. You know that notice I looked right at Brian, when did that, I mean we were thinking about what a thousand years from now, what you're, you're going to have things that you can't even wrap your head around today. It, it most likely will involve the manipulation of space and time. We're going to, we're going to probably in a hundred years from now have some ability to verse long distances. That seems possible. If we can get it, if we can just get over like a few technological humps. Oh, and again, this is a hundred years from now. What do you really think it's possible know about the God particle. They just kind of discovered her. Sounds very confusing. Um, it's, they, there are 99.99% sure that they have recreated this particle based on its mass.

Speaker 5:          02:24:09       And uh, they've, they've, they've discovered some incredible shit, man. I mean it's the whole idea behind it is really mind blowing. But what's going on is there, they're tapping into the, the conditions and recreating the conditions that are like a millisecond after the big bang and they're finding these parts of the universe that they had theorized about. And one of them is this Higgs Boson particle. That's God particle. It's fucking, it's too hard for me to wrap my puny brain around it, but when I do, it's, uh, it's pretty staggering stuff. If you stop and consider where we were in 1912 and where we are today and where we're going to be 2012 with this discovery of the Higgs, Boston Boson, whatever the fuck, how do what we say and whatever the fuck they're going to figure out within the next hundred years. I mean, it's, what does that mean to the, to the average person? I don't know that we discovered the God particle. I don't know nothing yet. Nothing yet. But it could mean everything. It could, it's the God particle which stands dark matter or dark matter. Here, let's, uh, let's get a scientific piece really quick. Okay. We'll get a scientific explanation of it.

Speaker 5:          02:25:23       It's that c

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       two o coconut water. Sun, Sun. Yeah. Note that, uh, we are in my place today. The reason being is because Brian almost got cooked with electricity. That's also why we don't have our Alienware laptops, but we are still supporting, uh, Alienware and you know, Josh Barnett was very happy that we did that because they support fighters and that's why we chose to do it. It's a big giant ass computers if you're a gamer than the shit man. If have the game or if you're like a hardcore Gamer, they like the best computers doing the three d one three d games portal. I've been playing in three days because the laptop is insane. We got these mother fuckers got an 18, he got an 18 inch, which is insane. It's, it's pretty much like an imax that you can fold it up. I got a 17 inch and it's pretty cool, man.

Speaker 4:          02:26:12       The, the keyboards are all light up different colors. It's huge resolution and it's really smooth for playing gaming. I'm doing pretty much using it just for gaming now. Yeah. That's the only reason to use it. They're their monster computers. If you're a hardcore game and there's people like, you know, oh he only wears like super expensive and they are not that bad. It's not cheap man. If you want a, if you want a built up computer, you know, it can be expensive, but that's just but not compared to Mac price as Max til pretty expensive. I realized cause I went to alienware's but it's Chi quality shit. I mean that's why if you want, if you build it together yourself, you could probably build it for cheaper. But a, I'm not building anything myself, man. I'm a grown man. Cooling. Yeah, it doesn't have the that well those laptops are special.

Speaker 4:          02:26:56       Those are, those are fucking cool items to have around. But uh, but the reason why we're not supported, we're not sponsored by Alienware. We're supporting a MMA. We're actually sponsored by a company called punched. What does it punch? Drunk love sacrifice inside. I didn't punch entertainment. So that's where it's coming down from. So that they hooked us up with a deal on the Alienware computers. And linker said, we try to support people that support MMA. And we try to support good companies, which is why I always talk about Cto, which is a fucking awesome. This coconut juice from Thailand and I got a new case that they just sent me that has pulp in it. I haven't fucked with it yet. I just got it today. Do me a favor. I'm going to do this live. Do you have any CTO left and night? That one right there?

Speaker 4:          02:27:38       Yes. I want you to take a sip of that and I want you to take a sip of this. I'm not drinking it after you dry. I'll wipe it off. I'll wipe it up. Good enough. Start, stop. Don't want to do it. Not Happening. All right. You want to be a woman too much? No, no. There's cam feels weird to me. Oh, you got a bad can. I didn't think so. Oh, go get another one. See if it tastes different. I don't know. I've never had a bad cam from them. Is that something that happened? It was just you. This is your, your reaction. It's warm to you like this. Better than that. A non pasteurized. Oh, it's warm. You know what? Because one of them was loose, which had been in my refrigerator for all like weeks and the other one just got it in the refrigerator right before the podcast started that you just pull it out of that big package I opened that can

Speaker 5:          02:28:22       see that case is not, that's not cold yet. This stuff is, it's way better coal. Better quote. Right? Yeah. Big Difference. It tastes like it's completely different than, yeah. Yeah. Apparently they say that it's from Thailand. Thailand. Coconuts are the most delicious and sweet when it comes to their coconut water. But, uh, if you can get fresh coconut juice like a if few near a whole foods, you should try. It's super expensive, but God damn is it good. It's delicious. Fresh coconut juice where it hasn't been pasteurized or homogenized just right out of the coconut, but it doesn't last very long. But man, if you get it, there's a company called it a press juicery that I use. They're great, man. That's a good press. Coconut juice is so delicious.

Speaker 5:          02:29:01       Uh, we're turning to you for conversation. We're going to Vegas this weekend. Last weekend. We never even broke down. Silva versus Sonnen. Hmm. I talk a little bit about it, but we didn't get to, do you think Anderson Silva was going to be a completely different fighter? This fight? Just don't fucking know. It could be. Yeah. You wonder like you man, he was, it was much easier to take down than I expected in the first fight. And he does, you know, that's it. That is like a guy who was injured. Like he didn't want to try to stop the takedown. Who knows? Maybe he's impossible to take down at this point. Not going to happen. I don't know about that. Maybe it's, the whole thing is interesting. When a guy fights injured, you just don't know. And Anderson's not a guy has ever said he, he fought different than he ever fought before.

Speaker 5:          02:29:44       And he's not a type of guy that makes excuses in the past, like a lot of people don't know that he had double knee surgery just five weeks before he beat Travis. Luder. That's the heat, you know, that's what, uh, his manager told me. He told me, I mean, that's a crazy thing. What he did, he fought Travis Luder like right when you're supposed to like not even be back to training again. Yeah. You know, five weeks in. So a guy who was willing to do that and not tell anybody he did, you know, beat Travis Luder a lot easier and more convincingly than he'd be Chael Sonnen though. So who knows? Who knows how much it really bothered him. But he won the bottom line is he figured out a way to win and that's why it gets interesting because if he's healthy now and he doesn't have any injuries, will he be able to stop the shot now? Oh, you know, will it be an easier fight for him or will it be the same fucking thing?

Speaker 3:          02:30:35       Maybe sun and takes them down. Um, maybe it's hard. Maybe it's easy, but it takes him down and he and his passing is getting better. What if he passes and triangles is atrophies? So that could happen. He's been working with Vinny Maga. Exactly. And Vinny says, Hey, and he, he might be trying to blow up jail, but he says that he thinks that shale has the ability to finish Anderson and I believe it, any, any wrestler at that caliber has the ability to squeeze in act. They just got to focus on it just a little bit. You focus on it. If he just focused on RM triangles and we'll make it chokes and a good team just keep polishing this shit every day. Just keep drilling it slowly becoming dangerous, which is those three. And of course you got to get really good at passing. Passing the guard is just as important as taking a guy down. You've got to get really good at passing camp.

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       Pass the guard man. All you have is ground and pound and dude, some nullify that pretty easily now. So you got to, and it seems like he's passing and as fast past few fights, his passing was looking good and uh, you know, he got her arm trying controlled Bisping on the ground too, which is really hard to do. Bisping is very good defensively off his back. You know, jail wasn't able to submit him, but he controlled him for quite awhile on the ground. But what he did with Brian Stan was really impressive. Yeah, he's smushed that guy. You look at it and that's like some serious pressure. His, his arm triangle is super legit. Brian. Stan was defending the right way to, but it was for, nope, you didn't matter. He squeezes too hard when you get a good one of those things, when a guy really develops a good one, when they really get a feel for it, especially when they were a big wrestler, like a chill son and guy already has like a sick squeeze and it's sick.

Speaker 1:          02:32:08       Top game is sick balance and just knows how to crush things down. They lock onto one technique like that. Man, they become so dangerous. Even when year's Eve, when you're defending, you still can get submitted. Just crushes your fucking head. You know? If that guy gets a hold of your head and arm, you're done so on, you're done. It's amazing. I'll dude's like Cody McKenzie. They just lock onto one fucking technique and get so laser sharp at it. They pull it off on everybody, even though dudes know they're trying to pull it off. We got obsessed with it. They put a lot of numbers in. That can happen with any technique that Cody Mackenzie's fucking guilty. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. I've never seen a guy, what does he have like 11 wins by gay t now? Something like that. So kratom incredible. Always chokes at the same arm.

Speaker 1:          02:32:53       Joey said that there was Marcel, he always showed his right arm. It's amazing. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm still sad that Marcel never got back into MMA. He had a one fight or he got cut and a, he had a hard time using the gloves at our time. Strangling a guy with those gloves on. I guess it makes a big goddamn difference. And then the grease two got to get used to that. There's a big difference between gay and Nogi and then there's a big difference between rash guard and no rash guard. Yeah, that's right. It's not the same thing. It's way more Slippy, Slippy point man. Do you think that, like when, when you see guys in Abu Dhabi and things along those lines, do you think that they should be able to wear pants? Do you think they should be a little aware? Well, and I'm with obviously cow.

Speaker 1:          02:33:36       You can't wear pants. You wear the pants. You could wear anything you want. You could wear a g if you want it. Really? Yeah. You can wear anything and I would not be. And can your opponent grab that key? Um, you know what, there's, there's some tournaments out there that have ridiculous rules that they just don't, it's just the most ignorant shit out there. It's amazing that it still exists. Like some tournaments, they allow you to work g pants and I know g tournament, but uh, your opponent can grab them and in control, but you can't grab it. And control shorts. I said, yeah, let them control the pants. But why can't I grab his shorts? He's grabbing my pants just because his, his pants are shorter. It makes zero sense. If you're going to allow someone to grab pants, you should be able to grab shorts

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       or don't allow it at all. Don't allow grabbing at anything. Just seems weird. If you have pants on and you have a g on, you're allowed to grab it, but if you just both are wearing shorts, you're not allowed to grab it. It's ridiculous. It gets tricky. Yeah, it's stupid shit like you think they should have to do that? Everybody should have to fight just skin on skin. Just valley to those shorts and that's it. No, I think you should be able to wear anything you want. I like the way the Japanese ran it. If you want to come in with a a kito gay, let them come up with an a keno game. What happens is, is that the boxing people that made all these rules, they didn't understand what was exactly what was going on, what you did. So they thought we're going to, we're not going to give anybody an unfair advantage.

Speaker 3:          02:34:58       So we're going to take away the key because people, they saw hoists choking out Ken shamrock with this color or with his sleeve. But really in Japan you can want anything you want. And if the pants were that dangerous, all the Brazilians would be wearing pants. How come? No, no. Brazilians are wearing pants except for hoists. The pants aren't dangerous. What they do is try to even out the playing field because people are wearing fucking, uh, uh, Vaseline. People or Vaseline binders are always squeezing themselves up. Strikers are you kidding? They don't want to go out there and get strangled at all. Putting on Greece the night before. It's not all a lot though. Not all, but a lot. How are they doing it? What do you think is the most common way they do it? If people like, uh, this is what I've heard is it'll take like cocoa butter and like sleep with it and then wash it off the next morning.

Speaker 3:          02:35:51       So your, your skin appears to be dry and then when you start sweating, it comes out of your pores. That's, you know, even finding a leg lock wizard, you're going to shave your fucking legs in, grease up. You know? And, and not only that, not only that, another thing that came from boxing, that's what's up with all the Vaseline all over people's faces. You don't think that gets all over their bodies. A lot of times people get accused of greasing and Henderson is in fights, wiped it off his face and under his chest. Well, whether you do that or not, when you're fighting and you're grappling, dude's touching your face, touching your chin and he's touching your arm. It's, these guys are, are, or have Vaseline all over their body by the end of the fight. So that's a, an unfair advantage to a striker.

Speaker 3:          02:36:33       You know, it's harder to get submissions. We should be pushing to get more submissions. You know, in professional football they push for more authentic. They change rules and adjust shit for more often. Same thing in basketball. What you're saying is that if they wore just allowed to wear rash guards, that would basically even up all the problems that we have with grease. If you want to. You don't have to if you want to. Some people don't want to wear shit cause remember and in Japan you could wear anything you want and what the Jujitsu guys chose to wear his little tiny shorts. They just had a lot of ways for us. We went to pants. Yes, yes. No pants top with pants on. But then he ended up fighting MMA was shortens no ports for 25 when he fought Matt Hughes. That was one. So that was again, they didn't allow him to wear anything else.

Speaker 3:          02:37:17       Yeah, totally. And the fact that pants are like karate pants or a geek pans are not allowed to wear like tights, like the way a Aoki wears tights. It's, it's counterproductive for the sport, you know, it just let them go would be a good way to counteract the idea. You know, everybody's greasy, greasy people are greasy and if they're not, they got Vaseline all over their face. It's going to get all over their body and it makes it hard to all that Vaseline all over your face makes it harder to pull off submissions late in the fight. You mixed that Vaseline with sweat and blood we should be like, it would be like, uh, like banning tights would be like banning a wide receivers wearing gloves in like rainy days or snowy days. They let them wear gloves so they could catch the ball. More authentic, more drop balls means shitty play.

Speaker 3:          02:38:07       People get bored, they want more high scoring. But that's not a person, the balls on a person. The problem is, the idea is that someone should be able to have the best defense possible with two men with bare skin. Yeah. I've also, one guy's wearing some sticky close and a lot of it, but it's okay. And the amateurs in California, they let him wear rash guard. It's no problem. Yeah. In the amateurs you were rash guards, just no problem. What about after that you would change the game? Female, female MMA fighters where rash guards. How was that? Okay, that's unfortunate. Yeah, totally. But like how has that, I mean, how's that? Okay. They have an unfair advantage. You should be allowed. You should be allowed to wear rash guards. I mean it works in female and then a, it should, we should allow it in the pros to what's the big deal?

Speaker 3:          02:38:49       It's just a rash guard. It'd be nice. People would come in with like tights and they look like little super hero characters. It'd be cool. Like Aoki was just his famous for the different crazy pants. He waters. It was for his fighting some down for a tights. The only problem that I would have with the [inaudible] is that you can use the gears and weapon. You get to Zeke, you'll choke the fuck out of somebody and that doesn't feel yes, yes, but again, in pride they allowed that, but no, but the, there's, there's way more cons to pros that were in geese. As far as the Geek experts. The expert said, you know what? Yeah, I could choke you out with my sleep, but dude can choke me out with my own color so it's not even worth it. You know what I mean? Amber, you remember when Yoshida, Fort Hoists?

Speaker 3:          02:39:28       Yep. Yoshida fought hoists and he said he was out and he wasn't out. He lied. Totally made up. The fact that he was out, he's like, he's, he's not even barely choking them voices, like foot was up and shit. I, there was no way he could've been out like his, he was like holding his foot up and now he's out. He's out. And then like reverie stops and he's like, what the fuck are you doing? I ain't out. They totally bamboozle them. Yeah. There's a lot of tomfoolery going on in Japan and that was with a, that was where the Ie, you know, he was wrapping them up in the gate. It goes away. But again, it's, it's, it's, if it was an advantage to where Aggie, all the Brazilians coming over and fighting and pride that all be wearing gies and g pants, you know what I mean? It's not an advantage. So amazing that hoist chose to fight like that though. He was, but then when you watch like Hickson's fights with Zulu, he never wore a, he worried a little tight

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       shorts. Yeah. Interesting. In the long run, the is a disadvantage. That's what the Brazilians are saying by not wearing it. They're making that statement. Yeah. That's kind of crazy. When you stop and think about it, there's this ancient outfit that people were, you know, they'd been wearing for how long? Thousand years. Who knows how many, how many years of martial artists from wearing baggy, you know, or taekwondo, they call the Doh Buck, you know, and uh, I dunno, what is it called? Kim Mono. Is that what the Portuguese like to call it? The Brazilians? I think that's a Japanese word. Yes. But they use the word Kimona was falling, right? Yeah. Japanese definitely called Kimono. But that's what, uh, that's what the Brazilian Jujitsu guys referred to it, right? Yeah. Yeah. We didn't accept Kimono. We took g and that weird when it got over here became a gay cause it went from being Komono to the Brazilian Japanese Kimono and Brazilian Komono g in the Brazilians didn't call it G. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:41:07       I think Americans don't Americans, uh, very rarely called Kimonos. And when they do, you know, there are serious Jujitsu Dork. You know, somebody asks you what Brand Kimono do you were you serious Jujitsu Dork? Some dude's just get so caught up in Jujitsu mad. It's just like, it's so much fun when you first start tapping guys. It becomes so much fun that some guys just completely lose their shit and just, just dive into it. Yeah. I was just too fucking free. I was thinking about getting out. One of those Americans are so into it. I love Brazil. Went to Brazil in 2010 in 2003. I fucking love anything Brazilian. Anytime a Brazilian was fighting and MMA, he could be fighting a Mexican. I don't give a shit. I'm gone for the Brazilian. I'm, oh, I was so hardcore. I would've got a tattoo of a Brazilian flag on my bag with that.

Speaker 1:          02:41:53       Oh, Denny progressive thing on it. I would consider that shit. That is a dose. Hardcore Dope logo. The presenter. Oh dammit. You Progresso. Uh, like maybe a then my guess is a oath promise to progress. I don't know. Some fun country man pursued it. They're the only country that shuts down for a month to party. It's beautiful man. There are people down. They're really fun. I really enjoyed doing the UFC is down there. The audiences are like nothing you've ever seen in your life. In between fights. They were doing the wave and screaming and cheering. I mean like the level of passion that the Brazilian fans have. It's not, no one's close. No one is close. Not Americans. And we've been everywhere. We've been fucking, no one's, no one's closed. Smash everybody with loyalty, sell it. Celebration, you know, singing and Jujitsu tournaments. I went to Brazil in 2000 for the worlds and it was, it wasn't out of like a giant place.

Speaker 1:          02:42:56       It was kind of like at an old beat up kind of arena. Like a mini beat up arena. It was like a, it wasn't that great. And those motherfuckers had drums and shit. They had all these chats. It was like a high school gym and they were going nuts. They would have crushed your leaders. They would have fucked him off. Do you remember? Um, when we were in Abu Dhabi and they started singing in the middle, like jock array was fighting and someone started the deal. It sounded like they got songs, man. Yeah. Singing and pounding on the tables or the, uh, the chairs like drums. I mean, it's amazing, man. They, they got into it to the point where it was like, it was like you were like, it was like, uh, you're, you're privileged to be there. Like you didn't know that there was a place like this.

Speaker 1:          02:43:36       He didn't know that this was, that this was something that was going on out there in the world. He wants these bad ass Jujitsu guys fight and then these Brazilian guys are singing and dancing in the fucking crowds. And do you think it's a coincidence that Brazil, maybe the only country or the only country part of the UN? I don't know exactly, but Brazil is super rare in the, they go against you and drug policies and make Iowasca Legal Eagle there. You think that has, I mean, I hear that in Brazil and I could be wrong, but I saw this in documentary. It could be bullshit, but they, that a lot of people give, there's like an io, there's an, I lost a Christian religion that's kind of like a mesh of boat and they give I WASC it a babies, they give Iowasca when you're 14 to prevent alcoholism somehow if you have, um, I WASC in your system before alcohol or maybe even after some in some way does something to your brain or somehow spiritually, I dunno, but it keeps you from being an alcoholic, a waste case.

Speaker 1:          02:44:42       And Brazil is like, fuck it. I WASC is legal bitch. And who parties harder than Brazil who celebrates more than Brazil? Those guys are fucking insane. I'm sure it has to have some impact. But marijuana is illegal. They're really, uh, really illegal. It's not good at all. You gotta be, you know, gotta be what it is. It is illegal. But a lot of Brazilian jujitsu players, they smoked weed. Very popular in Jujitsu, but it's, sorry, you got to have to deal with some, you know, people that are selling illegal drugs and the weirdest shit down there too. So I think South America just all together shit weed. It's unfortunate. It's ridiculous. And it's uh, it's uh, hopefully one day. I mean, can you imagine if Brazil had medical marijuana? Oh my God. If Brazil had legalized weed on top of the way they rocket right now on top of the greatest crowds of all time on top of the most insane beaches.

Speaker 1:          02:45:36       You look out and see islands and shit. Dudes are selling coconuts. If they had weed for free too, I mean, legal weed. Yeah, it would be the most ridiculous country of all time. It's weird how cultures just grow up and it's, a lot of it is depending on how bad where you live sucks. You couldn't have a lifestyle like Brazil. If you lived in Iceland like bitch, you got to go out and kill a whale. Okay. It's a fucking were when a freeze to death. Okay, we need some food. We need to batten down the hatches. We need to not in Brazil, you don't have to batten down the hatches. It's awesome out even in the winter, it's awesome. So what do they do? They they fucking party. That's totally cool. It's totally

Speaker 3:          02:46:10       Brazilian and totally cool and not to be like honest, like a strict schedule. They love to say, hey, you know when you're in Brazil, he and Machado told him in this man, I went to Brazil the first time. We kept telling him like, we got to do this. We're going to do that. Goes relax in Brazil there is no time. There's no time in Brazil and like, Whoa, these guys do whatever the fuck they want to do whenever they want to do it. It's all about having fun. There's a dude that I met down there that was a, I think he's a Machado black. I forget his name, I apologize. But he was telling me that he moved back there and uh, the late nineties he moved in Brazil and uh, just started living there and he just loved it. And he said, the one thing that you got to get used to though is like when you need something fixed, like good luck.

Speaker 3:          02:46:56       You need to do the show but your house at a certain time, well he might show up, you know, but you know, shit happens. I remember in the early nineties one Jujitsu blew up because of hoists. Gracie, because of the UFC, a lot of Brazilians started fucking making the move and opening up shop and taking territory's and so went to New York. How went to San Francisco and Machado's went to southern California. Horry on southern California. Everyone's just like, it's like the gold rush for Brazilian Jujitsu. You think about how many high level Jujitsu schools are in California? Hell yeah, they're all coming to California nuts. They're all coming in and Miami, they want the nice weather. They want the nice weather, they want the surfing, but they're still go to Toronto. Brazilians are locators, man. Don't fucking real. Okay. Just, yeah, there's some, there's some spots that is wide open, but you know, you really want to open shop in Wisconsin or something and then you want to go to hang for a while.

Speaker 3:          02:47:47       Cause like even Salo and Shonda, they went to Ohio for a while. They went, but there's only so much a Brazilian kid could do in Hawaii or in Ohio. So they said fuck it. They came to San Diego. Well, I'm like, uh, what's his name? Um, a no pile. Gabriel Gonzaga. He's in western Massachusetts. Man, it's cold as fuck out there. Right. Big Difference. Cause Marcella went to New York and then he went to Florida and they said, fuck it. He didn't like the weather in Florida. He went back. He loves New York. Well, New York is, if you're a thinking person, and Marcel was a thinking person, New York is much more stimulating, more stimulating people. Florida is nice and everything like that. But God damn though, I mean intelligence level in Florida Henzel some fucking New York. Kenzo fucking owns New York did he is the Godfather. He's like John Gotti of Jujitsu that our, he is that shit. Fuck yeah. And he's got, he's got a ridiculous number of students. Yeah. And he's making some serious bank and that guy and he's, he's one of the nicest guys on the planet, you know what I mean? He's fucking, he's on Twitter all the time. Just spreading positivity. You know, Marcello on Twitter, he's on Twitter. Not as much as Hanzo. Those on Twitter. Fucking I'm like, isn't it like five in the morning in New York right now? And he's still like, just Twitter, all just positive shit. Pencil is just positive. Positive

Speaker 5:          02:49:08       is he's aware. Where are they? How far away are they from each other? Handle school and Marcel school and they're really close. They're both in Manhattan. Really close. But Marcel also has a very successful school too, but hands are, I think Hanzo has been around forever. Yeah. Marcel was much more recent. But Marcello has that Josh Waitzkin dude, that chest wizard. That was, yup. I met him last time, I was in New York. Really cool guy. I exchanged some emails with them. Brown Marcello's guys are fucking so cool. The guy that they based the movie searching for Bobby Fischer. Yup. Yup. He was a chess genius. Spent all his life doing that. And then he got into martial arts and initially got into Kung Fu and then uh, I think he was doing push hands, like those push hands competitions. And then he got into Jujitsu and fell in love with it and started breaking moves down sort of the same way in a disciplined approach to the way that he learned to play chess.

Speaker 5:          02:49:58       You know, cause they learn to like think of moves and chains and progressions and so he broke it down as a discipline, you know, and made that Mj and uh, mg inaction website and uh, he's got all the different techniques labeler and you have that shame shit going on to add a at 10th planet Jiu Jitsu [inaudible] Dot com right. You can go there and you have it set up where you have all the different moves and techniques and someone doesn't even have to like train here. They can learn your shit online and then bring it to a local Jujitsu gym and practices. I release episodes of the show called mastering the system. I release one every few weeks and has every technique that I teach at my school. I put it up online for four 99 so yeah, it's an amazing resource for someone who lives somewhere. Like say if you're stuck somewhere and they, they don't have any high level Jujitsu, you can get together with your friends and you could start a club, you know, you can, you could, you know, get a certain amount of people and maybe they have mats at the y Ymca.

Speaker 5:          02:50:54       When I was a kid, the why I'm say had mats like you could, you could set some adds up and you could start a club. There's so many guys out there, so many ruins. They're getting two or three of their friends putting mats in the garage. Again, Marcello, you can study, you know, the Mendez Brother Study Edrick of out, you can get mastering the system, put it all together and have some fucking fun. And then they'll take trips. Sometimes. Like a lot of these guys will come in and you know, they'll train in Manhattan for a week, you know, like that's what George Saint Pierre did when he was young when Hanzo and train there, or they'll go to John jocks or they'll go to your gym. You know, we're in Burbank now, folks who view, if you were looking for the legends went under due to unforeseeable circumstances. So, uh, if you want to learn some 10th planet Jiu Jitsu, you have to go to our 10th planet, Burbank location shoots on Burbank Boulevard. What does the executor on 41 30 West Burbank Boulevard, and it's a blue dragon martial arts academy. If you see the Blue Dragon martial arts academies, so awesome tent. Yeah, the big 10th planet logo right there. But if you're driving in the street, there's a white sign that like sticks out. So if you find that that's what you can learn from hedge it Bra, learn to get the shogun. We're going to have a good time this weekend, man. It's kind of a fun, crazy ass. It's going to be wild.

Speaker 4:          02:52:06       Fuck yeah man. Party time. All right. You dirty bitches. This has been a long and disjointed podcast and we apologize for it. And Brian, you really got to get your shit together because you can't do any of the things that you, can I make a request. Can I make a request, Joe? Yeah, sure. I just dropped a new song and a, I want to play it for you right now. Is it too late? I think we have like four minutes to it and yeah, we only have three hours on a recording. Okay. You can play it afterwards. We'll stop and come back out afterwards. Okay. We'll do that. So we'll stop and come back and it will be a supplemental to the podcast. Ladies and gentleman, the Eddie Bravo Song. Alright, you freaks next week. We got a lot of shit going on. We got Tommy Chong coming up. We got Kevin Pereira.

Might have to do honey honey a little earlier in the day. And then next week we got Aubrey who's returning from Peru and another psychedelic adventury. Then we got bobo from finding big foot. I am very excited about that one wins that Vietnam beyond. Oh, she's uh, she's emailing me. We're going back and forth. We're going to figure it out. You're a Kat von d responded to me on Twitter today. Can I gushed like a little child it this weekend? If you're going to see that UFC, I'm going to be also doing a show. Doug loves movie taping at power station on Sunday and Doug loves movies. For those who don't know is the podcast of, uh, the, I heard grumpy.

Speaker 4:          02:53:37       Doug Benson, Benson, Darien grumpy, got an after party Saturday night at the cat house at the Luxor worth the 10th planet after Party after the UFC cat house lugs or everybody's invited. What is the cat house? It's a small lounge. I wanted a place where we could get everybody in, you know? And if we wouldn't have to haze or something like excess, like those clubs, you only get 10 guys in, it gets crazy. I wanted to, I put together a party where I made sure that all my 10th planet people, cause there's gonna be a bunch of them there this weekend. They get all get into one spot without any trouble. And you know, they've got a bar there, they got music. It's just for 10 plan of family. Any anybody that down, you know, you don't have to be, you don't have to go to a 10 plan at school, but it's after the UFC Saturday cat house at the lug sore.

Speaker 4:          02:54:22       Look for me. Boom bitches. Um, that's about it. Oh, if you're a fear factor fan, the fear factor episode where we wash shouldn't tell you what actually happens. But uh, there's a one two hour episode that we filmed besides the donkey semen one that won the tank in the show. There's one other episode that we film that's going to air over the next two Mondays. So I don't think they're advertising it. They're just sticking it in a hole and it's called burning it off. So if you're interested and you want to check it out, you'll probably never see it.
