Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Trying to watch it online. Yeah, stop it. You don't need to look at us. You fucking freak Spec on now. Okay. Hi Ustream folks. Sorry. We're off air for a little bit with the vagina light. Yeah, we missed the whole proof of concept. We're working now, you know behind the scenes type shit. Eliza and Heffron together might rule the world with this artificial vagina slash he's got to get half Ron. Except you on a team though. But I think I can broker that deal. I appreciate, you know, seen as you're both last comic standing winners you're, you're already having in, right? We have that bond. Unbreakable. Did you have to do the audition where you only did stand up in front of the judges and no audience? It wasn't even, people don't get it. I, my audition, you walk into the judges aren't there. It was just like a producer's assistants or like talent people.

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       They weren't even people you know and you walk in, you pitch your, you know, you do your joke. And I did. I talked for about 15 seconds. She goes, yeah, just come back this afternoon. And then I came back and they were like, you're not on the list. I was like, yes I am. And all these people kept trying to come back that weren't approved because it was so disorganized. You had to go through like a couple of rounds before he got to it that you went, you went twice head the head. Right. What does that mean? That's like they, she got challenged at the end where it was kind of like a, you all live in the house you lived, there's like 12 comics at the end of the week. Everybody pretty much votes who they hate the most. And it was never me, but they voted. If there was one other girl, they voted on her.

Speaker 1:          00:01:25       And then if you get voted off, you have a chance to then challenge two comics. So then the three of you do a show down in front of a live audience and to get kicked off and Wednesday. So I won both weeks in a row because everyone that got kicked off the house would keep challenging me and I kept winning. That's the only reason I want to show. Wow. So, so when someone challenges you, how do they figure out who wins? The audience decides votes right then and there, like a little button they press or something. I think so. I think that's how they did it. Wow. And uh, that's gotta be a weird way to do comedy. It's comedy under the gun, you know, that's kind of creepy if you, if you're a competitive person, which I wasn't until this or, I mean, I don't think playing Jv lacrosse counts for anything.

Speaker 1:          00:02:05       Uh, it's, it's great. It's dormant. It was, it was, I mean, I'd always played with people that were better than me. And then when you get to comedy, I had never thought of comedy as a competition. And now that's all I think of it as. I'm super aggressive about it. Why don't like you compete with yourself, but it's game time to him. Yeah. Do you know whatever motivates you? It's for some people it's done. Some people get real competitive. Some people, I would never go up to someone else. But you know, it's, it's like before you play a sport, like you psych yourself up and you get out there and then you go for blood I guess. Wow. That's an interesting way of looking at it. I saw you like two weeks ago and there was, I hadn't seen you before like for years, like until that show, like I hadn't seen it on stage recently, but it was cool about it is that you really have that vibe of the comedy store and not many, uh, comics actually carry some kind of vibe with it. And when you watch you, you could see the comedy store bribe. It's the same reason Boston comics were

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       so good. Yeah, because there's so many hell rooms there and you get used to that combat comedy and the comedy store is combat comedy defined. There is no organization there. It's a chaos room. It's, the room itself is an odd set up and it's, I come, I like to think I cut my teeth on rooms like the original room and then smaller, tougher rooms not going to get anywhere by going up in front of your four friends and like people that are laughing you for no reason. So doing those bags and those tough rooms where they just stare at you. Some people don't speak English, it prepares, it's like swinging with two bats. Yes, you're totally right. When you go other places like people are so much nicer, so much about this store and all the murder that's been committed. There are a lot of period, I don't know, it was Bugsy Siegel's nightclub in like the 30s or whenever that was and there was like a bunch of people murdered in that place.

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       There was a horse. Oh Co abortion. Illegal abortions. This like nerdy. People say they've heard babies crying and like, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Hold on a second. People are crazy. I never heard anything about part of the abortion backroom illegal abortions on Bugsy Siegel days. Forties or 50s oh my God. And they did in there, right on the stage? No, no, no sage. But it was like in the basement or something. No one ever goes in the basement. Lies is just making shit up. No, I'm not. I promise. Come on. Is there any documentation and can we find out about this online or is this just Holly? I've never heard that before. That's why I'm shocked. I mean I've been around the store for a long time. I'd never heard that story. That's right. I heard crazy stories though. People are always talking about ghosts.

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       They're like, when they do like haunted Hollywood shows, they always include the comedy store. Tell me about the guy that always does it from the Formosa. It's always on ie and he's always kind of like a fat guy. That always, I would say it's all bullshit except a few people that have said they've seen things are like really cool guys like Blake Clark. Blake Clark was a Vietnam vet and he was a standup comic. He's seen some shit, you know, he's been around and he was working at the comedy store one night and I didn't hear the story directly from him so I don't want to paraphrase it, but in essence, who's closing up? And he went into the room and all of a sudden there was someone there and he starts talking to this person and uh, he, the person's not talking back to him and then he realizes that some sort of a ghost.

Speaker 2:          00:05:13       And you know what? If you ask him what that guy looks like, other people will be able to corroborate the same image. A lot of people see the same like in the belly or have, I think it's a guy with like a top hat or something. People see the same things. A girl that did our show, I do a Monday night show, their brand new, never been their campus here friend. She saw something and told one of us on not privy to the story at all. It sounds like it should be horse shit, because every one of those shows that you watch, the problem is those goddamn shows, you know, it's like the create this artificial environment and you gain old cameras and lights and everything and you're growing and looking for ghosts and you have to find something in every episode and you're just knocking. There's not that many ghosts happening. You know, if there are ghosts, it's not enough that you're going to get them on a television show. We don't ever see them. I don't know if it's real,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       but I'm not willing to say that it's not, I'm not willing to say there's no ghosts. I don't. So many people are full of shit. It's tough. It's a tough conversation. I can't fit. I don't think you can beat my ghost theory though. My theory is you find somebody that was murdered like the midnight on Halloween and you go to the, like the wife's grave, you know, he's like a husband, wife thing, and you just start making fun of her on midnight and just go, hey goes, yeah, I'm making fun of your dead wife. Yeah, and nothing's going to happen. That's my ghost though. Maybe the ghosts recognize from the great beyond that you're a douchebag above this. Respecting your murdered white ghost has crossed over. I don't think. I think it's what people have when they go sidings and all this and he was an EVP or they do the white noise thing goes that have a problem with mean.

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       Yeah. What's it? What were you like that movie white noise where you can turn up the right and you can hear the ghosts like talking. It's like a thick lens flares that goes to have a problem with the ones that haven't crossed over the ones that are stuck because they died prematurely or in some sort of horrible accident. That's if you will. There's people that believe that everything has a memory. There's a guy named Rupert Sheldrake, I think he's an evolutionary biologist and he has this theory that everything has some sort of a memory like furniture and houses. They that even though you can't really access it, like the energy of the house can be compromised by having a lot of negative shit happening. It's all energy. It's not like the house becomes a creepy thing like it has memory to it and that's certainly what the store is when you do like an exorcism or a sale, if they ask for an object or if you're in a Pluto, it's an object from the person because it has that energy or that's why if you, if something comes out of a negative, and I mean I totally buy into the whole energy thing about not transferring like negative energy and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:07:49       And I do too if you like cooks you, but that's what they say, Cook with love, your love goes into it and you give it, it's about that if you're in tune to it, otherwise you just eat. Yeah, no that totally makes sense. That something, I mean and if it goes along really with the same idea that if everything has a memory and if you're cooking with love and then food has like a memory of your love and you creating it, people will like it more. I sort of makes it sound totally Hippie, but I should not eat so many lean pockets cause what's, what's that doing to me?

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       All the cows torture, torture or pigs are just stuffed in the boxes for the heads are sideways for half their life. It's so easy to love Bacon. No, never had weekends. Awesome. And pigs are cunts. Therein lies the problem. Fuck pigs are assholes. Pigs. More people die from pigs and farms than any other animal because people fall into the pig. Sties and the pigs just fucking eat them. Was that, what movie was that snatch? Yeah, that Shit's true. I'll start of research. You could have to that. That's me. I'm fucking in the theater on my blackberry writing research people and the

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       end of was at Hannibal. We're the guy like the crippled guy. They pushed him into the pigs and they beat him up. Yeah. A lot of pig eating. Yeah. That's some serious shit. Have you seen people fuck pigs? So those videos of, oh, the horrendous. So glad I came today. Hall people fucking the animal videos or her random. I've never seen a video of anyone having sex and I don't want to know, don't, don't ever watch it, but what you should see, what everybody should see is a documentary called zoo. Zoo is on, there was a bunch of people that have Zuph. I believe it's at proud zoophilia. Is this where like sexually attractive? No, no, no. They get fucked by horses. Isn't that how like Catherine the great died supposedly at the comedy store in the belly room. Supposedly that's how cats and their Greek God.

Speaker 2:          00:09:41       But we know for sure that there's one guy died that way because a, it's, it changed the law in Washington state and Washington state. It used to be legal to have sex with animals mandatory. You got gotta do what you gotta do. You're stuck in Seattle. But a bunch of people decided to move there from all over the country. They met on an internet message board and they moved there and started like this whole farm community thing where they got fucked by animals. Like there was like a whole bunch of freaks that like found themselves. They found themselves a friend. We're getting boned by. There's a horse. Yes. Look, the guy had like blonde hair. I have seen that. I saw a clip of that. Yeah, and the Mr Hands is the video pony bite her and she like likes it when he, the pony by May. This is a different one.

Speaker 2:          00:10:27       That's a different one. It can't be too, yeah, no, there's a bunch. There's over. I don't know. I don't necessarily think so, but it's kind of fucked up. I mean it just seems unnatural for sure. It seems like you were indulging the worst and human spirit. You know the idea. You just want to just exploit animals and have them fucking in the ass all the time. Yeah. He got, he got broken like broken open and bled out. The Guy who died, what are you going to go on to do? It's like, well you subsect of the animals and now I work at the Verizon store. Well that's a thing. He was like, fuck, I wish I remembered what he did. I think he was an architect. I mean he was like an intelligent guy apparently. Let me find out because this is just to, uh, to important in line between intelligence and absolute insanity.

Speaker 2:          00:11:12       And the line is a horse cock dog doesn't like this part. What a horrendous way to die. That ribbon, she removed it. That ribbon or what does that went around the cane. That's dessert. Oh, she's saving? Yeah, that's peppermint. God bless your heart a little after dinner. Mint. So you gave up on the droid completely. Oh, you follow that? What happened there? I can't find, started doing weird things. Right. And so I was like, screw it. I'm going to go with a droid just to try. Because I used to have a tree. I missed the touchscreen. Right. All these things. It was too much and there are all these problems. It could have made calls. It made weird sounding calls. It was all like warble note. Anyways, so I went, I was on, my breaking point was no one could hear

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       me on the phone, but I was on the phone yesterday. Yeah. Five times during a phone call. My face somehow dialed someone else and it starts ringing as I'm speaking to someone else. Like three Wade. Yeah. Who needs that? Yeah, like the droid enables you to call people you don't want to. So I just, I was like, I'm done. I want this for free. And so I got the brand new blackberry. Not Brand new, but you know what's weird about Black Berry owners though? I don't know if they know this and Joe, you, yours does this every time you text me on your blackberry is that if I replies, it replies, what? I texted you every time you text me back. So it's like you get like three texts. He, it's like it's reading like emails style. No, it's like, it's just crazy how much it has to be a setting, like a, some kind of setting in your textbook.

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       And it's called sock. I love my, I will give up touchscreen any day. I'm, I can't leave. I left my blackberry. I'm never living in again. Sorry. My phone is the shit, but 18 ticks sucks it. Why? Why, why, why don't you go to the iPhone? You seem very apple friendly. I Eliza, it's my parents. Got It. Who, uh, I love the, I love the iPhone. I don't want it. I want a keyboard. I want a full keyboard. I don't want my face fucking with my phone calls. Right. As I found out yesterday. Hmm. It fucks with it that much. Huh? Five Times. And it was a very important gossip conversation. Dan. Me and my friends are defending a friend in real life, so it was very important. The iPhone doesn't do that though. The iPhone doesn't hang up on your face. No. No, not how can you not because, because it detects when your face as close and it turns it off. The droid does. Lau. Droid does. It didn't and maybe there's a mode for it, but the iPhone doesn't have the full keyboard. Yeah. But you can get more than one plaid cover.

Speaker 3:          00:13:28       That's pretty, they have that though. They, they definitely have that. Whatever. I want. God, if I, if I just, you know, I use the iPhone more of like as a like an internet device. Yeah. Do as a phone. Am I get an eye touch? Yeah. If I was a producer on the road a lot this year, just so I can have something cause this is not great with those are pretty slick. The, especially the three g one where you can pull up anywhere. Yeah. It's pretty nice. I like that fucking technology bitches. Yeah. So that they've found some tools that indicate that human beings were traveling by boat more than 150 in as much as 700,000 years ago. Wow. Because a, there's an island, I believe the island is Crete and they found these fucking tools. There's a hold on. He's found these tools. Yeah. They found tools that were way, well, creed has been separate from, uh, from the mainland by 40 miles for over 5 million years. So the fact that they found tools there 700,000 years ago, I mean somehow or another, someone got there in a fucking boat or when it was a part of the world, like Pangea, when it was all together, people were there and then it split off. How's that foot? That's 5 million years. You need carbs. Supposedly 5 million years. People weren't around. You know, so what they're saying is if this island was 500 or 5 million years separate from everybody else and nothing developed on this island, but otherwise it'd have to be like parallel,

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       right. I believe in that really. Absolutely. If you have parallel thought process, how can having you not a parallel evolution like separate groups of people developed on this island or like when you come up with the same joke as someone else and they totally, Sam, I hear you. It's totally, this is totally the same. I should talkative guy. This is, that is a, is a fascinating subject though. It's been fascinating to me. Well, I think, uh, like they always taught us that Christopher Columbus came America first. We were like dead last. The Chinese were here before. They use Chinese maps to come here in the first place. Like they were your way before. So what you're seeing what your textbook wants you to believe. They found the oldest human being in North America, the bones they found was a Chinese guy. Yup. There you go. 10,000 years old.

Speaker 2:          00:15:34       So that's even not even predates the American Indian. I'm that crazy. Can we pay reparations to the wrong group? Well, you, American Indians came from Asia to that's, that's one thing they found out like def definitively because this Mormon dude was trying to do a genealogy tests on American Indians because he wanted to prove that American Indians were Israelites and that they had come here and this would prove the Mormon text to be correct Israel. That's what everybody thinks. That was the idea. Yeah. So, but they tested them. They, when they tested American Indians there, they'd come from Siberia because what comes from the Bering Strait? Yeah, a crossover when it was all on Alaska. It's a that's fascinating shit. You know what I mean? When I said that, um, that the Chinese were first. I don't think that's true. I think maybe the American Indians were here like, I think they crossed that before 10,000 years ago.

Speaker 2:          00:16:22       I think there are probably here first, but just the idea that here any, I mean a bunch of it, a bunch of what people are here. They fucking walked here. They've walked here from another continent. Yeah. But not in one lifetime. No. But it, they took a groups of humans over time, walk through like insanely cold, harsh environments and got tow. Erica got gotta be warm or somewhere. It's fucking crazy. I love that kind of stuff cause you imagine if you had to go back in time and no one even was even riding horses yet and you're like, what are we going to do? We get to walk everywhere. Don't you have like a, you have a bit of a brilliant bit about this, about like what will we do with all the lights went out? Like I can't make shit. That's the only time I've ever seen you in person.

Speaker 2:          00:17:04       I think you did a show at red rock. It's the first time I ever met you as a long time ago. Oh Wow. I remember that. That was only one thing. I went on a four year or something. And you did that bad. I thought it was, I thought it was very smart and so funny. Thank you. That's all I got. I remember that now. Yeah. That's the idea is that people are getting dumber as technology gets more and more powerful. There's people that have less and less resources of their own, less and less ability to do things. No littler and littler every year about what makes everything work. You know, in the 50s like if a guy broke down on the side of the road, I look, I would pull over and knew how to fix your fucking car. Right? You know, you've got a broken belt here, buddy. Let's go get a belt for you. And you know, you know that shit could work. You could do that. Now if you're, you're fucking Ford, that crazy car you got that thing breaks down the side of the road with

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       all the electronics and shit, it won't start. Nobody knows what the fuck is going on in the day. You know what is interesting about that? Unless you don't have higher education, then you're more likely to become a mechanic or someone that knows about cars. The more education you get, the further removed you are from what makes the world tick mechanically. Yeah, that's true. But what I'm saying is that most people, like there's a general knowledge that's missing. I agree. And American. Don't touch my fucking cars when you touch your car and do you ever have to bring it into the shop and they fix it and the check engine light lawn for like two months. I grew up here.

Speaker 4:          00:18:22       I grew up never ever using a card, like a place that worked, fix her car ever up to, I moved here in California because my dad like every time it broke down, he's like, all right, we got to go get a new engine and I'm gonna show you how to do it. And like I had to Redo that whole car. Yeah. But, but that's crazy now because now I have to do that. I had to drop off my car the other day and it was like an oil change. It was four hours for an oil change at this Ford dealer. And they actually have a restaurant inside the Ford dealer called like the, I forget what it's called, but you order food and the Bacon looks like seat covers. It's just like really long rectangle or why can't I use a Jiffy Lube or something? Why don't you go to Jeff?

Speaker 4:          00:19:01       Because, no, I think it's something like if you have a and you're under warranty, you're supposed to take it to the dealer, you know, just in case. So. Well No, no. So the warranty, if there's anything ever wrong with it, they can't blame somebody else. What I mean, yeah. Jiffy Lube is the shit. Oh yeah. I liked him for the pope and 10 done. My friend's car got fucked up by Jiffy Lube. They didn't, they stripped the uh, oil uh, oil back in cause they use those things like you know, things real quick. And if they put it in wrong cause they're doing cars all day long, you know, it's strips it and then he just, his car leaked oil for the rest of his car. It was like a brand new car

Speaker 1:          00:19:37       died was off on his comedy is dead. I am always the basement. How they can always get me to buy new air filter for my air conditioner go dirty. It is, I'm like, it's a filter. It's supposed to be dirty and just take a hose to try it. I don't want it. I don't want to die either. Fix that shit. What are you going to do? That fluid in there? Yeah. Do that shit with the the red stuff. Yeah, but those filters you just spray out and that's all you need to do that either. Then they started talking transmission fluid and shit like that. Then you're like, listen kid, you know you don't know what the fuck you're doing. Get out of that transmission.

Speaker 1:          00:20:10       If you tell me I need it. If there's something I don't know about, I'm that girl. I wonder how many people get shit done to their car every year. They don't really need just because someone wants to make you on my car cause they said I needed it. Balls that big Porsche wings. It was English. That's what I want. A car with a wing on the back of it. Literally walk into a store like a makeup store and she'd be like, what do I need and let them sell to me. I don't give a fuck and I'll buy it. I don't even wear that much makeup. I just like to have it. I will buy everything. Food. I'm an easy target.

Speaker 4:          00:20:42       Yo, have you seen this homeless man guy from Columbus, Ohio? This is, no, this is amazing. Yeah, I keep hearing

Speaker 1:          00:20:47       about it. So I have not seen check, check this out. I tried to show it to you, but what it is, it's a home. My hometown, Columbus, Ohio. This homeless guy held up a sign and I said that, you know, I can do voices for food or money or whatever. Yeah, totally not that right. Yeah, it looks exactly like

Speaker 5:          00:21:06       freeway exit ramps. But recently there's been this guy with an interesting sign in [inaudible] 71 and Hudson street. His handwritten signs says he has the God given gift of a great voice.

Speaker 6:          00:21:19       Hey, we're gonna make you work for your dollar. Say something with that great radio Voice. You're listening to nothing but the best of all these. You're listening to magic 98.9 so much. God bless you. Whoa. And we'll be back with more right after these words. And don't forget tomorrow morning is your chance to win a pair of tickets to see this man live in concert. Thank you so much. Mona was 14 years old. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York when I was 14, I kind of listen to one of our area radio announcers and uh, as a field trip to go meet the guy. And he looked nothing like what he sounded like. So I asked him about that and he said to me, listen, radio is defined theater of mine. And so when he said theater of mine, I just said, well, hey, I can't be an actor at camp, be an on air personality. But the voice just became something of a, of a development over years and then went to school for it. And then alcohol and drugs and a few other things became a part of my life. I got two years clean and I'm trying hard to get it back and hopefully somebody from one of these television or radio thing, hey, I need a voiceover or I need something. So, you know, I'm hoping one day watch family guy weeknights at seven 30 on Fox, 20 year anything. But that's what it is. And I love radio. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:41       Yeah, I got sad at the end and the beginning was kind of Nice. Beginning was actually cool. If that was a 15 second clip, it will be the shit got weird. Who greets those signs? That's smart. That's really small. The worst. That's when, when it's the couple like it looks like that, you know, they just do math together and they're just living on the road and have like a bowling ball bag and the worst is when they have a dog. Isn't that awful that the dog is what touches your heartstrings? That person, but I totally fucking dark. If they had a kid, probably the kid would get taken away. Someone protective services would come and take the kid away most likely. Right. I mean, you can't have a kid and be homeless. Kenya, I saw an episode of law and order the election you of Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          00:23:24       Yeah. Madness. It gets enough box at that kid knows how to change a tire, eat a tire to how to cook a tire. Well, that guy was like, I noticed that the guidance sound or anything like he looked, I'm like, I felt like he was going to be like, I was white, so I went out, died my skin, got my nose clean. To do when you're homeless is to have a gimmick. Isn't it amazing that voice is like, it's like a tool almost like the DJ voice. Like it's such a uh, an affection that you take on when you talk like a Dj. Here we go. You know, it's like something to it. It's creepy though. What have you done for me lately? That's like an old radius thing. That's like a dying sound. Probably though. Is it? Because podcasts, podcasts don't do that. There's not like the guy gets it.

Speaker 1:          00:24:11       Hey there. Hey, we should do that. We should do a podcast and a DJ voice. You're listening to red by radio. Hey you, here we go. All right. It's also the Strip club Dj. They're very similar. This is this the same voice, but with a couple of drinks. Denver has your approval Lexus to the main stage. It's like the same guy over, especially in La are, so I have a bit about this, which I'm not going into. They're so ignorant sounding. There's this one I listen to like the hip hop stations and I don't know if he's like Latino or what. He's like, y'all, you guide, get your ad Oh insurance. And I'm like, why does that, the word is auto. And it's always like, Yo, after you motherfuckers, if they want insurance, y'all gotta get down there. And I'm like, you are just spreading ignorance.

Speaker 1:          00:24:59       Like people think it's okay to get a job and you're yelling at me and you're mispronouncing everything and have it in Spanish. I know how to speak Spanish properly speaking to their people, Chichi that there's, there's a lot of them as well. It's not that, it's just so wouldn't, if you're, if you're fine, let's say you're La Rasa and you're going to community college, you're going to school or you're trying to get a better education and this is what, this is what your people are telling you, it's okay to sound like sort of, maybe they're just hanging out, you know? Maybe that's just the way they talk. Yeah, it's, I, I know what you're saying. I do agree that maybe you should have like better English and stuff, but you know if you know what the fuck he's saying, we're not saying anything. They're not saying no, they're not talking about the news.

Speaker 1:          00:25:49       It's just like, Yo, boost mobile. That no way. That not ghetto. I like it. I want to make sure there's a few ghetto stations around so I can listen to them. I like it because that's just connected to like remember that old video with the leper confound found in the tree. I remember finding this. Yeah. Have you seen, oh, this is from like four years because you will remember this. Once you see this Leprechaun, a bunch of people are going to be tweeting me. They think I'm racist after this. Y'All can eat it in Alabama yet, but it's called Leprechaun in Alabama and they found this. Let me know what you're saying. You're saying that people should speak like they're educated and set a good example. You should know what you're saying is you're going to say anything. I'm never going to listen to you because you sound, what I'm saying is I'm, everybody's different. I like watching people and listening to people that are nothing like me, you know? So I like listening to ghetto shows. No other games. I like listening to them on the radio too. That's what they want to talk. They don't have to say anything. Listen to that shit.

He suited up from him was all smells right here. What's this is this liberal curve probably slowed him down. This is Nicholas. We can having an aneurysm as we fucked up and pick the wrong youtube video. All right. And this is what's called poor prior planning. So, but there was there a real, a real true story.

Is this like a crazy special bond that you have with a dog when you adopted dog?

Speaker 2:          00:30:02       Cause that dog's life could have been super fucked up. Super fucked. It could have been shit. I mean, you never know. She could have been put down. She needs anything can happen. But you came along and got her and I, she gets, she's very needy. She gets upset if I leave. So I take her off.

Some people would go great with some one person, but with other people that clash and it's just, everybody's got to find that on my brand.

Speaker 2:          00:32:17       Like chemistry. It's all about Brian. It's not just about bodies, men. It's about the person behind the body. Sounds depressing. My dog got to concentrate on the sole. Brian, you've got to concentrate on being real with these bitches and find one who is willing to be real with you back. See what I'm saying, Bro.

Speaker 2:          00:32:56       Alright, here's Bob or the midway. What's going on Bob? We have a slowed down at the five. You know, I noticed today driving here that if I wanted to be a gardener, all I would have to do is walk down the highway. I would find shoes, hats, rakes, garbage bags. Like there was like so much shit on the side of the road. Have you noticed how much crap is on our highways? Like ridiculous things like couches and chairs. And is it because you think they're not cleaning up as much? I think it's all these landscaper guys that just have those trucks that have like all the shit in the back, you know where there's just falls off. I'm waiting for it. Right. I'm waiting for a rape to come right through my windshield. I ran over a railroad tie once a big metal railroad tie, you know those big fucking things that like, yeah know in movies get crushed on empire.

Speaker 2:          00:33:43       I'm sorry. Not a tie. The Gay bar, the bar, the middle bar or a bar. The Bar, wherever that the railroad track goes on a track. Oh my God. We're all retarded part of the rabbit with the tail. The metal shit. The metal shed bro. Fucking long thing that the wheel rolls. I thought you were talking about the state. Nope. No, no, no. It was a bigger one. Or are you talking about the state? No, no, no. I'm just kidding. Do you guys track this railroad? Right? Not a tie. I said ty, incorrect word. What I meant is a, a section of track. It was like a big ass fucking giant hunk of metal and I'm driving on the highway and all of a sudden I, I see it before it's too late. There's nothing I could do and Bob by hit it and it just tears my wheel apart.

Speaker 2:          00:34:27       Smashes, it tears the wheat, the tire off the wheel. And I had to make a decision and I said, you know what? I'm just going to drive on this fucking thing. I'm not getting out on the highway and like risking getting hit by some fucking car. I'm like, I'm going to cook this car, you know, I'm just going to drive in this fucked up wheel and cook this car. And it was, sparks were flying and shit and smoke and it was, it was nuts because it was like half of a wheel. It was like half a wheel in this fucked up time. And I'm going like literally you have far to go? Yeah. I have like almost a almost a mile deep. Did you binge it rims locked.car up I how to get a bunch of shit done to it after it's over. Yeah. But you know what is better than me dying.

Speaker 2:          00:35:08       That's what I thought of. I, there's a kid I went to high school with it. It was changing his tire off the side of the road and somebody hit the car and killed him. Why you shouldn't change your on tires. Well, but have you been watching horror movies lately? It's always the girl getting her flat tire and waiting for the guy to fix it. Girls take 10 minutes out of your time. Find out figuring out how to do it. Just in case of emergency, you don't want to be calling these times. It's a physical, so truck drivers trying to get those fucking wheels off, bro. Those those times, sometimes it's really hard. Sometimes it's hard for a man, like a big man to get your your fucking bolts loose. I'm the first ask others for help. Nobody would attempt stuff. Sometimes it's a payment you should try.

Speaker 2:          00:35:45       You should learn how to do it if you can, but fuck man, you can do it fast. It's pretty easy. [inaudible] I guarantee you some bolts that you would not be able to crack. I've been in. I could look at you. You've just rose up like a man and puffed a chance. Never had a problem ever. I love it. I've never had a problem ever changed a tire ever. Really awesome. Easy. Wow. Between the two of you. Who Do you just have to use the retard strength like okay I got to do it. I mean sorry, not retard strength. I changed a lot of tires when I was a kid but I stopped a long time ago. I forgot everything that's involved in it, but when I was in auto shop in high school we listed though it used to change tires like you know, do you use that fucking stupid machine cause I know that moves the tire in place and put the weights on it.

Speaker 2:          00:36:30       It was kind of kind of interesting stuff but I forgot all of it. We had this shot, this a teacher in auto shop that all he would do was fix up shitty old mustangs. I wish I could remember his name because he was a real character. It's probably on Facebook. Probably Facebook me Bro. You remember me? I remember you. I just forgot your name and he, he's probably dead by now. I didn't want make you feel old. It is. No, no. Getting away from it. Every year I get a little older. I hate when I think of like an old actor that I think is dead. And then I go and find out that he has like a Facebook and a website. Remember that shit? What? Jonathan Winters the other day I was like, oh, he's dead. He's still alive. He's still alive. He's got fucking CDs coming out. He's got paintings. He's got it like a website.

Yeah. He was the guy who used to, he used to guest on Mork and Mindy, Remember Douglas?

U R is Sir Denea low vich. That's his real name. It just rolls off the tongue. I can see why he chose. Oh, vich. Wow. It says it in Russian letters. Is it on Wikipedia? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       What would you like if you had to change your name because he had it fucked up named like that. What would you change it to if it kind of just Darth Vader? No, like seriously. I will change my name to Darth Vader. Would your backup name be like a real name? Luke Skywalker? No. It'd be like, it'd be like Lance Kenobi bitch. That would be my full name. Yeah. I don't know anything about cars or star wars. No, you don't. I got Kevin James had to do that too. Well, I don't want to say his last name. He probably doesn't want people knowing I had to do it. I can be called Reich. Oh, here you in. This sound rude. I sound like it sounds like next generation. Yeah. It's like no matter what, like people were forced to think about the third. Right? Right. That's fucked up just a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:39:18       They're going to not like you as much as they should and you're bubbling. Personality is not going to shine through you being held back by a douchebag name, Bro. Fuck that shit. Can't go wrong with red fish. Keep it as that and then just be the guy. Be the one to change that stereotype. You can think of. Nazis were going to give you reinvent yourself as Red Ban, Huh? Yeah, that fucking name. Legally, but now, now ever since I've been rid me for one, now there's like a red band, like techno artists from the UK and there's this other ripping you off. There's all these red bands now and it's like, that's not fair and tell people to jump on the red band wagon. He's got it. You're right. [inaudible] dot com is his, he's in the box. It's over. It's done dude. You're like a rapper. You've changed your name. You really had to sell. I can't be calling. Right. Cool. I have my last name doesn't do me any favors. How about Charlie Sheen?

Speaker 1:          00:40:19       Joey's like, I'm going with dad. Uncle would help. Dad rocked it. They have different fathers. Is that what it is? Or different fathers gotta be mothers so they're allowed to have sex with each other. Totally Bang. It makes sense now. That's how they're married. Their kids would be fun. That's how they were married. Charlie Sheen is holding it down though and kind of tell you I'm talking about a god that just keeps doing the same shit and dislike. Just keeps moving forward for him. When he walks on set for two and a half and don't like the day. Is everyone just like quiet like Zimmer pretend like nothing happened. Kid high fives. I doubt it. Do you watch that show at all? I bet he owns that shit. The best thing about that show is when the, how they show the kid, like morph into the adult.

Speaker 1:          00:41:04       That's trippy. Yeah. The thing about Charlie Sheen is Charlie Sheen has like $100 million, so he doesn't give a fuck either. So it doesn't matter if he gets caught with hookers. She's like, what the fuck ever shut it. I hope he does. Hot shots. Three d you think you could pitch it? What would be the is retired navy seal guy or whatever. He has a son, uh, Bieber and Justin Bieber and Justin Bieber's he has to train him to take over a fucking huge mood.

I looked up at him and I went like this with my fingers. Right, like from stage. Yeah. It's just, it was very funny. He's like, he's like, he's right. He's right. He's right. It was an inside joke. He, we would always joke around with, the problem was, I don't want to do now. He's a good guy. The wrapper, if Mike were black, he would be Drake. I think they look alike. I'm going to drink whiskey with him or was that, my ties are Nando's hot whiskey drinks with Mike.

Speaker 1:          00:42:41       Heidi. I had hot toddies last night. That's like young or Drake, Huh? Both of them. Who did you mean? Initially? Mike Young. Oh, I'm sure he wouldn't have be need for coffee or Mike have travels with the Russell tribes or Russell Peters does it. Really? Yeah. That's good. That's why he was in Montreal for the UFC. I love his song. Take me back. It's a fun song, man. We should find that. We want to play that. Is that even on the lot? That's hard. Okay, I'll find it. You know I could always email it to you. I'm sure I have it on my computer. I'll just buy it from iTunes. Also. Port bike from iTunes. Fuck yeah, I'll support Mike if you can put the link up. It's actually a really good song. Have you ever heard my caps on? You ever heard a song? It's a good song.

Speaker 1:          00:43:22       We freaked out. It's really good. I was like, Mike, man, this is like a good fucking pop song. I don't know what it is. Is, is he rapping it? Oh, it was sorta sorta wraps. I'm Jewish. My brother's a rapper. We love it. Where the fuck is it? I don't even have it on this computer. Son of bitch, motherfucker. Oh, here we go. Yeah, I can buy it by, by that shits on Pie. I want to hear a song. Oh, it's so good. Like we, I was actually addicted to this. Shocked. I was really shocked.

What's your account has been or what the fuck is going on? But then we're being held back by technology, by things. Speaking of which, this is something, were we talking about this before the podcast started? Um, conspiracy theory, punk conspiracy theory about what the fuck is happening with these birds, Arkansas. Shoot. What are you saying Joe Rogan. Eliza talk about the birds and the fish that suddenly die. Oh, I didn't even see that birds and the fish conversation. I didn't,

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       I didn't read the Twitter. That's all I do. But that is what the subject is. The um, the, these fucking birds, like thousands of them fell from the sky and over a hundred thousand drum fish are dead. And then this guy gets murdered. Who is an expert in chemical warfare and uh, some guy in, there's all these, these websites connecting him to uh, to this, this fucking dead bird kill that they were, I mean who knows how much of it is real and what speculative and what's just conspiracy conspiracy theory nonsense. But it's pretty fascinating that this guy who's an expert in chemical warfare gets a assassinated.

Speaker 1:          00:45:13       He's probably responsible for it. And Peta is the one that is acid at him. They're fucked fucking and his favorite song. I highly doubt it but I think that's funny. Oh Mike Young. Cause he plays hard. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:45:36       I sent you, that's not the song. Take me back now. Funny how time disappears.

What's it called again? Cat. It's so, it's, it's just, no, it's just catalog.

If you want to contact you go to Facebook or something, it's fine. Oh, that's funny. But why do you, uh, how come you don't want to have your own thing? Why would you want to just have it on Facebook? Like message boards? It's like it's a, it's an interesting thing to be able to have like a whole group of people that you're, you know, you're communicating with and it's all hosted on your side. I think she just think I do. Right. But I also have one, there it is. I have one for my web show that we do. There's a message board for that. And what, yeah, what does this web show, because you were guys were, you were going to tell me before the show started, but we decided to wait.

Speaker 1:          00:48:56       My show is called the weekly news. Wea. Koi. Why you've been doing that for a while. How long have you been doing it for? About maybe three years. Then we took a break because we lost our sponsor and we just got back starts next week. And how do people see it? Where's it at? Coda? The stream.tv. The Stream? Yeah, like water, str am dot. TV slash weekly. And now there's all these backlog episodes and uh, we get on there and I, I just thought it was important to do a show where it wasn't some girl just cackling about Kim Kardashians. So we talk about the headlines and what's in the news and I get into debates with people and it's all in good fun. And uh, it's the weekly news, but if Kim Kardashians subject comes up, don't be afraid of it. I'm not afraid of it. Fuck those motherfuckers don't want them holding the camera.

Speaker 1:          00:49:35       Can you say her name's that? People hear me saying it and then they search or I don't want to add to that. You don't want to add to it for our whole family there. What's wrong with our society? Are you sure? Positive one. It was like weapons and shit. We're doing overseas with our society more insular and not so much as the city's actions. What's wrong with the world? Girls like that? I can't even, I mean you're probably friends with our, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not friends. You want to know? My opinion is this, this is not a gel. She's gorgeous by the way. I'll give her that. She's gorgeous. It's all these women that are uneducated, unintelligent self entitled, did Jack Crap for anything and now it's not even about the money. You have all this notoriety and publicity and there's nothing to you and it teaches women in our society.

Speaker 1:          00:50:17       If you're just, if you put on some makeup and let someone pee on you or if you are, not that she's a gold digger, but if you do nothing and just act like a total fucking whore, rewards will come through higher education. Screw integrity. I see your point in any industry. I also see it though. You've got to let the market dictate and I think that there's a market for a horse. There's a morning bird is a bargain for empty people on television. There's a market like their players, I mean, and not calling her a whore. She's seems like a nice person and she's got a great ass. What I'm saying is there's a, this is a market for people that are trying to get attention for no reason and they're doing this. People get fascinating fixated on them because they're regular people and they start following them and then they become players in of legit fucking show that people get hooked up on and roped into.

Speaker 1:          00:51:04       I am part of the problem cause I watch like real housewives of Atlanta, 16 weeks pregnant. Crazy. I've been watching Beverly Hills. I watch all of them and I'm so, I'm a part of that problem. But I guess my thing, the Beverly Hill don't be hating. That's all. I'll say it. I hate it. It's got to let them let a freak be a freak. He just got to let them just got a lot of and watch it. You fascinating. That's what 16 and pregnant. I can't watch. I can't watch that. That one good shape. That has been beating people's, he's been arrested like three times. If I was 16 and pregnant, I've been kicking dude's acids too. I sit scary. She's probably out of her mind. What's wrong with MTV for doing that shit? That's well, you know what's right with they're showing it to us. I don't think it's wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:51:44       You don't have to watch it. You know what? There's a glamorized. I think it's not quite summarizing it, man. I think for a lot of people it's going to scare the fucking shit out as I was like, why are all the girl's fat catty woman? You give credit where it's due. I mean there were attractive, I said Kim Kardashian was pretty chess. You did worthless but pretty worthless. Pretty and worth. If someone wants to fuck you, you're worth something worthless in my eyes cause I don't want to fuck her. I want to fuck camp north north from the Atlanta one. The sister that you liked, that one that they can one the wig chick. You like her totally have sex with her. I'm going to have cigarettes with her and fucking just kidding. Brian has a tight, tight. Brian likes wants a big woman that gets on top.

Speaker 1:          00:52:31       No, no, horrible. That is wigs. Hate fake hair. That's just what a girl was trying to choke you. Was She fucked you? What if a girl was trying to choke me? I don't like that shit and I don't like every girl tried to do that. I don't like crazy. There was this girl when I went to a fight, I went to a rave once when I was like 20 and there was this girl that I took home and add the next morning. She heard that we had sex, but she was trying to choke me it in the next morning. She had no eyebrows that they had like smeared off and it was like raver eyebrows where she had no eyebrows that were painted on and when she woke up it was just smear it all over her face. She wanted to, she was trying to choke me the whole time.

Speaker 1:          00:53:07       It's like, what the fuck this chicken murder somebody by now the girl wanting to do. I can understand that. I've never heard of a girl like is a big choker or he should be here. I can see that every time I there was, we were in Austin. Yeah, Austin in this the whole time. He's just sitting there like he just met this girl. He's just choking her the whole time. I shouldn't be talking about this. Is that the comedy queen made it sound like you were in bed with no, it wasn't like he doesn't care. I always talk about that. I'm sure he doesn't care. I don't think any guy would care, but it was just uncomfortable for me because like, wow, I can't do that. Can't just go up to a girl, be like, Hey, I'm your neck. You Fun when you're young. If you date a girl who's like really into her feet and like playing with your deck, where your feet you is get like foot fetishes.

Speaker 1:          00:53:52       That's where they get it from. Where it starts. Yeah. That's where it starts. I Dunno. It's just really, if you read, could be both. It could be. Could be. Could we have a bunch of reasons for having some weird fetish, but that could be one that he just dated. A girl in the sex was really hot and she likes to get choked, so he just started associated like choking, like hot sex. That's crazy. Right? I don't know. I don't have any, don't like boobs. That almost offends me, that don't don't like that guy or I don't really care. I'm like, how could you not care about, but that's so important. Yeah, I agree. 100% are mostly guys. Are you hanging out with what guys? Are you thinking that they're looking for flaws? Yeah, I know you got a whole big tits and shit, Blaine, and the guy's like, just right here.

Speaker 1:          00:54:38       People talk on TV or male comics. They're like a more of a buck guy. I'm like, I don't get that at all. Um, if I had to choose between one or the other, I would say I'm more of a Buckeye. Why? No, it's not the problem. I love breasts as well, but I've seen a lot of really attractive women that have a small breasts and big assets. You're looking at their breasts more than you are there, but it doesn't matter. It's aesthetic, you know? What do you think is sexy? You know, I don't mind girls with small breasts. It doesn't bother me. I'm like, I have, I said this before just because you have big tits. That's all it is. And you're from Texas. It's like, it's a great system. It's ingrained in your system. That's a big titty state I lived between. If you had to choose between a girl with big tits and a flat ass or girl tits and a big juicy yes she has no, but it makes it easier to lie down.

Speaker 1:          00:55:26       You can touch the boobs. No crazy. That flat ass. I hate those acids. So flagged, but it's really mostly, these are people I knew a girl in college, I had one of those flat asses that look like where girls sometimes disturbing. She had a little chunk to her. I didn't want to hang out with her just because of how uncomfortable her asking me. It's different than a tiny, but like elephant butts where it's just like a flat rhino surface. There was this one girl when we were in high school. It's just one girl that had this, the strangest body. She was like, um, she was like five feet tall, but she was like three feet wide and her shoulders and her hips were equally wise. No, she was just a big girl. She was so big. Like I remember just like standing next to her. She was so fucking wine. So big. You're like, this poor kid. Nothing you can do about it. She's just giant bones. She was just like this five foot tall neanderthal looking fucking freak, tiniest neanderthal and the herd that's all small. They were,

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       there were all little at one time. My favorite, all neanderthals were five feet tall, like 200 pounds. They were totally felt different than us. Yeah. They look like wolverine from the Eczema in comic books. For Real. That's what they looked like. Yeah. He's really short. He's really and yoked. But these things are actually shorter than him. You know, we used to, we talked about this in the podcast and we've before, but in the end her talls about why they died off. Um, I don't know, but I bet they have best the best boobs. The, well, the reason why they died offers because human males fuck the female neanderthals. But human females wouldn't let the mail neanderthals fuck them. But don't they rape and pillage. Isn't that their shtick? We were kicking their asses. We're smarter than, than, than we may better weapons who are fucking them up fucking their women.

Speaker 2:          00:57:06       And then we just sorta integrated them in. The males died off. That's what happened. Well that's why the French are so I say we like it was me like I was a black. The boys kicking some stupid monkey s that's why the French are little bit you think? Yeah, because of the neanderthals and that is a part of France to do with like all the strong ones went off to war and they were so weak. All the big guys died so all the little ones were left over and that's why, wow, what a trip, what a trip for any culture. I guy's ridiculous. How crazy is that? That that's like a real concern. Some cultures that men go off to war and they'll die off and then leave, like all the smart number of females. Then the women have to become fucking warriors who tried to fend off invading herds of men and whatever happened to that old school that go to war for like three years and the chick actually waited for the guy.

Speaker 2:          00:57:53       You know? Nowadays. It's like this. Second, people leave now world war two they were getting closet pussy just like they are today and it's so easy now. The girl leaves and he puts it on Facebook. Oh, I'm going to be lonely for the next three years. You know how many fucking messages that girl gets on your boyfriend who's overseas? You deserve dynasty of age, right? Yes. AIDS definitely the dumb Hugger, right? Unless your boyfriend's a Douche bag and didn't realize it until he left, went to war and then what? You get stuck there because you want to be a patriot. Cheat on him. Just share lonely. Can't generalize. I mean, maybe the poor girl just realize that she's free now. Just fucking hat. Maybe I want to explore my life and I don't want to get into confrontation with Randy because he gets fucking angry and he shoots his guns.

Speaker 2:          00:58:37       Shouldn't say Randy. When Renco tourist, one of my heroes, I should come up with a better name for my fake person. I don't think he's gonna think you know a Ronald. I don't know why no one named Ronald is tough. I would say Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan, Ronald. He had lush, bless you cheeks. Trying to think of any MMA guys I know named Ron. Fuck the Ronald Reagan, but that's what the real name is. Ron. If you're Ronald, you become nerd. No one's like Jack, Ronald or Ronny. So you have to pick, Huh? Well the Ronnie, but this one is the same, isn't it? This long name is Ronnie. Really? Dave's Randy. Hey, are you related to Dr Laura Schlessinger? No, not get that question all the time. It's Hearst has a c that's gotta be annoying as fuck. Right? It doesn't happen enough that I'm like upset about it.

Speaker 2:          00:59:25       Did they ever think that you're her? Maybe I'll get easier upset. That would be worse. I said maybe I'll get easier. It's easier to upset me than you. It happens, but it's not for me. It used to be like Fred Rogan, the sports guy, but spelled different. Worse people to be asked if you're related or Fred's. I'm sure he's a good guy. I'm related to Kim's all see ag. Who's that wig where like, oh, you know her. You know her last name and everything, but she goes by, she has a song. I think she quit smoking while she's having the baby. I bought her CD. No, she's smoking. She smoked emotions pregnant. Absolutely. That's hard to see, man. That is one of the hardest things to see the nurse, so you know, she saw that in Canada. He stepped out of me and Ari Shaffir, we're way up in fuck.

Speaker 2:          01:00:15       I think we're in Saskatoon somewhere. Crazy. Yeah, it was way on the middle of nowhere. It's really interesting. And we stepped out of this restaurant. There's chick there, big fucking belly sitting there smoking a cigarette. I'm like, wow. Probably trying to do the kid a favor. Get rid of it. So it doesn't have to be born in Saskatoon. Fuck. People have made the argument that it doesn't. I mean, it's stupid that it doesn't affect the cuboid affects the kid. Absolutely. I blame that for awhile. I'm fucked up. What? My mom, my mom's smoking while I was in the womb. That's all my issues. I remember when, I remember my friend's mom smoked and we'd go bowling every Saturday and she would just sit there with the window cracked open and just the smoke would hit me in the face the whole way to the bowling alley.

Speaker 2:          01:00:56       Remember going, oh this is the worst. This kid I went to high school with, his mom and dad both chain smoked. It was the creepiest thing you would go over. It was just a house of death. You'd go over their house and there was smoke ever. It was fucking cold as shit cause we lived in Boston, you know, so you go over their house and their living room was just filled with fucking smoke. It was just, you would walk into like a death cloud, like they're killing themselves or choking themselves to death. My best friend growing up, her parents were insomniacs that chain smoked and so she'd be like, come sleep over my house and we'll go home reeking of cigarettes before a formal, she's like, come over to my house for pictures. I'm like, I don't want it. You'd probably be jacked from the nicotine to.

Speaker 2:          01:01:32       Did you get like, did you feel the nicotine, we kids who you're just, you're already running around. We have mellow child. What? Mellow child. He's trying to get to know you. No, no, no. I mean, because of all the cigarettes fellow Chow's IML a child by her. So relaxed, but it's such a confusing conversation, Bryan burrough. Yeah. I feel really bad for little kids who's parents smoke and the smoke around him all the time. They get it in their head that that's, you know, it's just a part of life. You know? Some people small can shit. Maybe I should try it too. Well, it is relaxing and then next thing you know, you're hooked on the tit to. It is a bizarre thing that there's no politicians calling out for that shit to be illegal. Is it bizarre? It's very bizarre. Bizarre that people tolerate it.

Speaker 2:          01:02:14       400,000 people die every year from cigarette smoke and no one, no one is up arms. Do you know what do you mean? No one is up in arms. They're not. No one's up in arms. No one's trying to stop and no one's making it a part of political campaigns probably make a lot of money from pricing. Oh yeah. Well they definitely do think it should be illegal to smoke anywhere. But in your house, like when I go out to eat, even if you're smoking on the curb, it's affecting me. It's such a thing as just fish habitat, illegal period. I think even the most smokers would say, dude, if it wasn't sold, if you guys made it legal, sure. I think you should be able to do whatever you want to do and your house, you want to smoke a cigarette, I think you should be able to talk to her.

Speaker 2:          01:02:47       I definitely don't agree with any sort of nanny state bullshit where you can say that happy meals can't be legal because kids get tricked into eating them cause there's this toy inside of the shut the fuck up and it's a God damn happy. Exactly. If you want to buy a happy meal every now and then for a Goof, what? Who gives a shit stop? This is nonsense. So people should die out. We shouldn't go jazz. It will. Yeah, I think so. Government's job to protect is not the government's job to make you eat right or make things easier. It's their job to protect your right to do whatever the fuck you want. That's all hers. Don't think you should be able to tell me or can. I know cigars can give you cancer too, and I like us to Garvey known then I don't think he should be able to tell him what the fuck to do.

Speaker 2:          01:03:24       I want to do what I want to do, but they just, you shouldn't be able to smoke in my face, but there should be some sort of a way that we can find out what the fuck those 599 chemicals that they've added the cigarettes are first of all because of a bunch of 'em have been concocted entirely to effect the addiction process. No, it's mostly spices. Spices. It's a certain menthol smell. It's angel balls there should that dessert. It's the stuff that they put installation, you know, fiberglass. It's in menthols is what they used to always say, make you itchy as a kid. You don't wait on it. And then you'd have all, I remember that I used to install that shit. I used to install fiber glass, paint stuff. Anthrocon when I worked as a labor for doing construction when I was a kid, my father was an architect so I got a lot of jobs on construction sites and we used to have to install a lot of that shit.

Speaker 2:          01:04:15       And you just go home just issuing man everywhere hardware floors, you get bad zits too. That's what my attic used to have in it. And I used to just like looking at the pink panther logo, so like jump in there just to look at it. And if this summer, summer in Boston installing that shit, oh I get so hot there, I went to college there and wide, well ac in my apartment, it gets wet. It's like that wet heat that you don't get here in California. California heats no big deal. So 110 degrees out here and you're like, ah, it's hot. But no big deal. You know, it's 110 in Boston or New Jersey or in one of those that's just swamp. Especially if you're like in a city, there's no relief and there's a steam everywhere. You know they have bear problems in New Jersey. Do you know that New Jersey has like, they just started opening the open season on bears.

Speaker 2:          01:05:02       Now they have bear hunting tags. You can get bear hunting in New Jersey and it's not shooting bears if they seem like they were looking at that control. You don't realize that a big part of New Jersey apparently is rural. We always think of New Jersey was neural big. We always think of New Jersey. He's like Newark and these industrial areas and these dumps shit. Sopranos, do I have a bad accident? No, no, no, no. It's just, those are weird words. Newark, Newark, New Jersey. I was born and, but a huge part of New Jersey. It's just woods, you know, and there's fucking bears are invading into people's neighborhoods and one's bears get addicted to eating out of garbage cans. They know how easy it is to get the food that way. They just go to that every time because it's way easier than killing animals or pulling up roots and shit.

Speaker 2:          01:05:48       So they just start fucking up people's garbage and they just move into neighborhoods and have like real problems. Can Show your funny bear club. It was on like the tonight show a couple of weeks ago. I saw this in the, and you don't need the New York cabs in the back. They have like little, like NBC video clips and you can watch, right? I was in New York couple weeks when I saw this. Just put, Hey, what are you doing bear? It's literally 10 seconds and it's the funniest thing ever. People should look at it. It was, they named a whole segment after it. This is this the top one. The thing where I keep looking for it. Hey, what do you doing bear? Hey, what are you doing there? And what is it if this farmer and he is here to us, this one, watch this. Oh, I know what you're talking about. Who's not a farmer. He's a hunter to understand thing. A farmer and a hunter's. Totally kidding. It's close. Well, maybe for it until he gets here. Well anyway, what it is is, uh, this bear decides to climb up this ladder where this guy is a hunting. She's really scary and he scares it off quicker.

Speaker 7:          01:06:48       Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:06:49       Bears are highly intelligent. And that's not the sentence. That's a different one. It's a different one. Yeah. That's okay. Sorry. That's okay. It's like almost the same thing though. Well, I don't understand why this is parents just get it like to the, anyway, the barrier. This is the best podcast average. I hate when people can't find the clips and then they're like, just wait a second. It's, and that it's not funny. And then their internet sucks.

Speaker 9:          01:07:12       Here it comes. Yeah. And then just watch the bears looking up the ladder. There's a bear at the bottom of this tree stand and now the bear is climbing up the tree. Stand the ladder here comes. Yeah. It's a lot of it. It's treestand bears climbing halfway up right now. Oh my God. Say something, Dude. Hey, what are you doing there? Were you doing there? What the fuck?

Speaker 2:          01:07:49       How lucky is he that that bear does not know what's going on and just run away? Was fucking crazy. What are you doing there? And then there's like a made mistake. Wrong House. There's a guy that's pretty relaxed. Yeah, that guy's relaxed around. Would've been screaming again. Bear was halfway up the fucking ladder before he said anything. He was hoping the bear is going to change its mind. That's crazy. You don't get real big when a bear comes. You just have to reason with it. Bears respond to logic it unless have their babies with them and then they're going to eat your ass hall growing up in Texas, asshole asshole first and they'll eat you out from the inside. Growing up in Texas, did you do a lot of hunting? Like a lot of, um, should we don't hunt for bargains? You know what I did use to do my friend Lauren, her parents were into something called like reenactment shootings and they would dress up in period costumes like early or late 19th century cowboy attire.

Speaker 2:          01:08:41       And we would go out to like the middle of nowhere and like fresco before it had houses there and they would have little town set up and they would do timed events shooting like rifles and you get awards at the end and we would just sit there in the back of a suburban and drink Dr Pepper and watch her parents do this every Sunday, like 6:00 AM and they had like cowboy names and there was like a little community. Holy Shit, we got to shoot guns. Wow. Awesome. It's like a cowboy version of dungeons and dragons or something. Yeah, it's kind of like civil war reenactments, but there's no shot shooting back those things and like civil war reenactments and um, I don't get them either. I don't, I don't get the, uh, I guess I get the renaissance thing a little bit more. Renaissance Fair. It seems like there.

Speaker 2:          01:09:24       Yeah, that's what I go there having fun. The food is so good. The civil war thing is like ridiculous stuff. Are you just running around with a gun? I don't think so. I think they plan out the war plan out like battles, like this is when these guys came over the hill and it's like an accurate historical what happened or believe so directions. Well I think they just pretending they're really doing it in real history and they're getting a boner for it. There's weird all civil war buff, fucking weird man running around with fake bullets and you're shooting blanks and shit. And as a kid though, watching that, that was really cool. You know? And it showed you that something that you normally used to have books for now you can just be a video game. I wonder how often those civil war reenactments. I'm wondering how often people get actually shot.

Speaker 2:          01:10:07       That's like, oh, I thought these were all blanks. Like you did least. Who just said, I'm just going to go in, I'm going to shoot someone. And I'll say it was an action. I thought it was thought it was blank. I'll never know who all have the same gun. They won't know it's from me. And they would have to figure out who shot the real bullets. Brandon Lee, dude law and order, civil war, the friendly leaking, right? Oh yeah. That always scary. It's fucking terrifying. They changed the rules. Now you know, because of that movie, you're not allowed to point a gun at a person. When you're in a gun scene and you're shooting at them, you're not allowed to shoot a blank at the person. You have to point away from them. So like the props I just loaded in a real bullet on accident.

Speaker 2:          01:10:42       I don't think so. I think there was something in the casing that wasn't exploded. Like there's something in, it was like, there was something stuck on the top of it. I think that's what it was. It was like sitting and acted as a projectile and it shot him and it was a really close range. I think too. I've thought about that and I've always thought about that as like a horrible way to go. And then I realized I can't even get callbacks. So I don't think being shot on set is like an issue of mine yet. Like you're not gonna be that picky. When I was, when I first came to California, it was like 1994 there was a guy who I was working with whose friend had committed suicide accidentally on a set because they had a blank gun and he didn't know that you could just put a blank on up to your head and pull the trigger.

Speaker 2:          01:11:25       The camp no blows your brains out with the fucking wow. I never knew that. We wouldn't have done it, but he took this in front of everybody and he's like, Hey, look at this. Boom. And he fucking blows his brains out the force and the air of wow. Wow. What an awful way. He probably didn't die. Right then he died, hemorrhage, big hole in his head, went down, started hemorrhaging. They bring him to the hospital dead. That's fucked up shit. Yeah. That was on youtube. Do you ever see the Budd Dwyer? Have you ever seen that? But Dwyer was a, he was a politician. Do you want to watch it? Yeah. God, Budd Dwyer was a politician, I believe it was in Pittsburgh, and he was corrupt and he got caught and he, they called a press conference and he pulls out a 44 magnum and the press conference and blows his brains online. Oh yeah. That's sad. No, it's going to freak the fuck out. Maybe we'll find out what you're made of. If you're an ice princess, you might just look at this and go, yeah. Lisa Cell Phone Cam. Fuck Budd Dwyer. Fuck yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. It's not about you right now.

Speaker 6:          01:12:31       Where's Greg? Is that him? Yeah, it's like Alfred Hitchcock. Yes. Words. Don Johnson. So he, uh, he wants everybody in the room and he's got an envelope. Yes. Oh yeah. Watch this. Here. He opens the envelope. Where are you looking right here? Look at this. Great reminder that right for the moment. He hands out some letters and then he pulls out the gun. Wants you to shit.

Speaker 7:          01:13:08       When I rolled with it as well, that all down Maddie, please don't Mag. I almost started crying. Someone called the ambulance.

Speaker 2:          01:13:42       Yeah, that wasn't cool. How would you want to watch that? Yeah. That was in the movies. There's not even that much blood gushing out well, but in the movies aren't really accurate, but you would think a movie would do more, right? Like what? It's always exacerbated. Everything's always bigger. I've never seen blood gushed out of someone's nose like that. Yeah. That's horrendous. I'm so sad now. Really. What bugs in a better place now? Probably not. Maybe so. Probably at the comedy store placement. He's in the basement doing abortion, so I hate he was pregnant at the time. That's why it's terrible. So he killed himself. Oh Connie. I know. It's a trip to think that the spectrum of human behaviors that that vast, that there's people that their life is so far beyond repair, their brain is so fucked or emotions are so fucking damaged.

Speaker 2:          01:14:29       Everything just so much pain. They just want to stick a tube up metal in their mouth and just end it all but playing. That's one of this haunting videos that will always be in my head, that the woman getting hit by the train is another one. The Guy Getting fucked by the horse. The guy. I'll watch that. That will make me feel better. Monkey pull up two guys. One horse.com like here hurts now cause the, cause I'm watching that oil. The DOTCOM is, well this is what I was talking about with this. The Movie Zoo. Yeah. It's really, they really change the law because of this. So what happened was, I can't wait to watch here. This guy died and then they, they interrogated his friends and they found out about this farm and they went there and there was over a hundred hours of video of guys getting fucked by animals.

Speaker 2:          01:15:11       Yeah. Well they don't show it in the documentary at the moment. The documentary is like, most of it is like reenactments and you know, kind of describing everything that happened when it went down. It's just so fascinating, especially from the point of view of the people who were they living there because you know, these people were like in love with animals. I mean they're, they're really, there's something going on that's not right. This is the question before we saw this, when whoever built this website was like web mastering it. Do you think it's fair to be like, hey, hey cutie on the phone. How do I get that Jpeg of the horse running? I can be really cute on this website. You know what the pony is it from clip art? Like what do I get this? We put it auto compliment the horse cock and really well from a website from like 1986 the two of them on two of them. Crazy horse cock jokes. This is obvious. Okay, this is gonna be fun to watch her face. I don't want to, by the way, this is why this is 100% no, no. There's another guy. This is, yeah, that's why it's two guys. One horse. That's the guys are, look how he's holding it to try to keep it from going into far. That's my favorite part.

Speaker 10:         01:16:18       Oh Jesus Christ. Joseph. Yup. Look at that. Do you have any say in it too much? It doesn't test now. That's a horse day and that kills him right there. Listen to this.

Speaker 2:          01:16:34       Oh God, he was there. They were saying he came, he came. They were like all excited that the horse came. How vial that killed that guy? Yeah. The guy who was in that video, it was a guy that used to go by the name of Mr Hands. Don't drop. You can do, you can do this. Eliza, you got through the whole last comic standing really hot and like, what are you doing Bryan? I was trying to cheer her up with Lemon parties. What? Blue waffle dubois boy blue. No, blue off blue buffalo documentary just blew off. Why don't you Google that shit?

Speaker 2:          01:17:16       It's like the 20th image down. You have to ingest it. She's really good. The picture. Oh my God. I'm Google images. Blue waffle can even call it a vagina. That's Photoshop Vagina. I think some girls with their vagina get that out of him. Looks like no, that's not out of hand. That looks like the Predator got in a car accident and then drown and then drowned. I wonder if I can ever jerk off to that picture if I really tried hard. If you had to, if you only have to come like a little dribble, you could probably pull out. Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can. Yeah. You can. If you're not turned on. I mean you can't control it like consciously, but, but factors that'll how hard your cause more comes more for guys barely turned on. You like it? Bull bull challenge this. No, with snow it's, it's a fact.

Speaker 2:          01:18:17       If a guy's not turned on, if you're, you're jerking off to a picture of a fucking disease vagina, you're not going to get a full of wax. It's going to be like not going to get a full much come as you would if you were super turned on. No, no, no, no, no, no. Do it flow. I can show you. Show you. He'll fuck you and everything's going to work out. This is all been a plot by Brian. Look, see, watch. Brian don't do this is disrespectful. She's a girl. You can't do that. This kid, that's not cool.

Speaker 2:          01:18:48       For the folks listening on Itunes, Brian just pulled out a big rubber penis, which you can't do on a movie set. Brian, we're where we're number three, number seven and number 29 in the top 30 podcast. Did you get that email? Yeah, that's pretty sweet. We're just all their episode loaded episodes. So everybody that's tuning into podcast, thank you very much and thanks for all the positive emails and twitters and it's, this is a lot of fun to do and we enjoy doing it and we enjoy having people like a wiser come on. Very polite dog. No, we're going to keep this rolling and we said time, no, I just wanted to say thank you to people who have to wait till the end. If somebody said, oh I don't know what people are tweeting you back because I said something about Saskatchewan, I'll back it up.

Speaker 2:          01:19:29       Don't just don't listen to them. You can't, you can't be this connected machines control. You can machines could trailing you man. That was a good way to, the good way to come back. It is a good way to connect, you know, just don't want to connect all the time because then you're get to eventually it's going to, they're going to invade all aspects of your personal robots will take over. Well, who's going to be some sort of a, you know, hey, you know a camera where you can see two V, two views, the view of you and the view that you see of the world and you can choose, share these views with people. That's what's going to happen. You're going to have your own little fucking Internet TV channel and it's your life and you know people. Some people let them see everything. You'll look straight. You can see out when I'm washing myself,

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       but you can't see back. You can't see me naked. Like people would draw the line at which cameras are going to keep on. Really someone's taking showers and shit with cameras on them and move around the house. It's called something like she's Roulette Chevorlet oh, that's totally different. That's dudes pulling their dicks out. What's why it's chat. Realizing they, I'm uncomfortable with my step mom was telling me about this solid black. She goes, she goes and I went on to Emily's, my stepsister, one of Natalie's computer and I could see her on her friend's looking and I didn't know what they were looking at and I went in their room, they were on chat roulette and they were looking at some guy's cock cock, no reason. She was like, it was just a big cock and I was like, yeah, I think half a chat roulette is that.

Speaker 1:          01:20:51       I've never seen, I don't know what, I've never, what's cool is they have an iPhone version and that was one that that's a few people to download and save a bit about this. How was one of the few people to download it and then they pulled it off the iTunes store so you can't download it anymore. There's like a good 20,000 people that downloaded that APP that's still use it because it's still works, but now it's, but now there's no new people, so you're just start recognizing penises like, oh, here's Jim again. Yep. Is that his wife in the background when they pull it, they can't take it off your phone. Like it will still work. It will still work. Damn well how come? No one's figured out a way to get it back to the phone? I don't know cause I'm just getting everybody's fighting.

Speaker 1:          01:21:27       Tired of looking at the same cop that if you ever done that facetime thing where you have to talk. How's that? Was that facetime and see if you had an iPhone you could call me and do video video. Yeah, I think it did. Yeah. Cause can you do hit it each time? Do you have to have a Wifi connection now? Uh, yeah. Yeah. You have to have a wifi connection and showed that t mobile phone, the new one that doesn't have wifi but it has the four g or whatever it's called. I don't think, I don't know if it'll work in anything other than apple phones. But what has this two way video chat? I think it only works apple. I think you've got Skype now. If you have Skype video now, just groups released on the Skype video. So you can do the same thing as this. Yeah. And it's, that would be more universal. Skype video is actually three g two. It's not Wifi, uh, Skype video. So the jerking off his back on back on, is that what it is? A lot of that. A lot of two way jerking off. Is there a way to record it? Oh, somebody secretly record Brett Farve Dick was to 8 trillion off totally theirs. I don't think it's his dick. No. Why you say that? Because I mean it was maybe after he had um, practice when he was really tired.

Speaker 1:          01:22:41       He gets it up. Do you have imagined you could imagine a different, right. I have in my dreams. How would you imagine Brett farms cock to be like a wolf shoulder pads and warp radiator cock? He liked to think of your superheroes is having superior wiener is kind of a trip when you see a dude with gray hair out there playing professional football and log. Really what the hell is going on here?

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       What's going on? How are you doing this? How are you playing old though? He just has gray hair. He's 40 something old for a professional football player, it's the magic white is balls look like. Nope. There's lots of old people in athletics that are able to compete somehow or another after age 40 there's not that many. It's pretty fucking small. Yes. Quarterbacks. They're not as known as impact as a quarterback and linebacker. They're getting nailed on the as often as like a bigger guy. But when they get nailed that getting the extra hard, cause they are like a little bonus, you know, take out the quarterback. People get very excited to do that. And the quarter in fact jail. Yes. You know they're going to change football though folks. They're gonna put fucking centers in Canton. Their helmets, they're to, they're going to find out what kind of impact people get.

Speaker 2:          01:23:52       Crest has let me style. Oh I thought you meant so. They could have cursed my belief it like if they were hearing it from their point of view, like I'm wondering if football, the football has a real issue with head injuries. A lot of these guys are getting like really massive brain damage and then as they're older men, they're just fucked up. They would get Lou Gehrig's disease. They have all of these issues. They eventually become paralyzed. Some of them, their body just just eventually shuts down and it's from continued head trauma or smashing their head into these fucking helmets. And so a, they're going to start making them wear these sensors that detect what kind of impact they get. And they do it for hockey because they're probably not more body and on hockey they slam into each other and everybody's slides around too. You know, it's like, it's probably better to be on ice when you're slamming into each other because even though they hit you really hard, there's a little, there's, it's slippery.

Speaker 2:          01:24:43       You not dug into the ground like you are like in a football field where it's dirt and you're running and you're running a, they'd absorbed saying guess more impact in packets it stationary. Yeah. I just feel like you would move. I mean that's why like hockey fights don't seem as dangerous. I mean sometimes guys get fucked up and hockey fights. I saw guy, but it's his own helmet. Oh, that's not right. It's an accident. But it happened. That's the Douchey move, you know, hockey fight, everybody knows he puts the, take the gloves off and you circle and then he'd go at it. You don't be hitting people with their fucking helmet. That's this week. Shit. There's nothing worse. I will say this, I just remember playing sports in high school. There's nothing worse than when you aim to hurt someone, but you accidentally hurt them in a way you didn't intend to and it looks more aggressive than you meant and that's when you're like, that's, I didn't mean to punch her in the mouth.

Speaker 2:          01:25:26       I meant for it and it was an accident and it gets caught. And so you are like a super competitive person. You're, you're there throwing in cheap shots. Did you throw cheap shots on girls in Lacrosse? A lot of yellow cars. Oh my nickname. You one of my Nigga was butcher because I was defense and I took it very serious. Oh, you're mean. So you would just hit them with their sticks, hit them with the sticks and shit really, as opposed to not do it anyway. Right. A little love tap. He hit him with a stick. Like I was hitting bitches with sticks, man. She was playing Lacrosse. He was hitting chicks with sticks from Texas. They don't like one of my worst memories from high school. I got a red card. You know what? You would be into union. You would be into martial arts.

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       Have you ever done any martial arts? You are so aggressive. That would be such a good thing for you. I would love to take something just so I could back. Like when, uh, when it's something like a girl is a bitch and a nightclub, I would be able to back up my shit talking. Well, you don't want to fight. No, but I feel confident enough it'll, it'll be better because you won't be worried about it ever get in a fight. But I would like that confidence to know that I could handle it. I just mean for just getting all this energy out of you. Like in, you mean the elliptical 20 minutes a day isn't going to do it. It's not going to do it. No. You need to hit something. You need to hit something. Where should I go? Well, I'll, we'll talk afterwards.

Speaker 2:          01:26:37       Tell me where, where you live because you don't want to tell these fucking freaks. These online people are listening. No, but can I tell you something? Yes. Speaking of where you live, somebody sent this to me. I'll give you the address right now. Somebody sent this to me. There was a website you can go to and it's probably a bunch of these. Here it is. It's called spokeo.com s p o k e o.com and you can type in your name and your name will come up where you live. Don't say this. No, no. You can block yourself. I took myself off of it this morning. That's what I'm telling you. Anyone, they'll tell you how much your house is worth. Let's talk about this letter. No, people should take themselves off if people are going to find you. If they want to find you. Oh yeah, it's 2010, 11 nine stone.

Speaker 2:          01:27:19       But you should use your block yourself. Yeah. You shouldn't promote this. I was pissed and I said my house was worth less than it was. Yeah. So don't tell me where you live on the air, but afterwards, um, I'll, I'll find a place. That scenario, I don't want to get kicked in the shins or hitting the boob or in the mouth. You have protection for all of those things done. But uh, really the best thing for a girl to learn his Jiu Jitsu because Ju Jitsu is not really reliant on strength. It's really more reliant on technique. So you could actually subdue a man. Like you could choke a man like Dan, my friend Felicia, she weighs about 130 pounds and she fucks men up all the time. She's a black belt. And the men, it's so frustrating for men. There's nothing they can do. Two pressure points.

Speaker 2:          01:27:58       No, it's just, it's technique. It's chokes and arm locks and stuff like that. But when you do it correctly, so if you get attacked by rapists, he will grab him and throw him on the ground and start rolling around with him. I want to learn small joint manipulation. That shit doesn't work. Yeah. No Dude's will let you break. Their fingers are still punching the face. It doesn't work. Believe me, when adrenaline's flowing, you're not even going to feel that finger. Oh, was not for fights and still just being annoying. It doesn't really work where it pulled her hand away. Went fucking handbag. No. That's why you have to be smart. I only pick on people weaker than me. When we get that you or your friends see you pull them into your web and break their fingers. So fucking some weird maneuver. See, you're a competitive person and this is like, it's all natural and it's just, it'll help you so much if you just fucking punch at a heavy bag or do a Jujitsu class, like it'd be so much more relaxed. I would love to. I would love to take something like that. It's fun. It's fun. I, that's not a thing you have you ever tried yoga? I have done yoga. I like to move and that's very, I don't enjoy meditating and stuff like that. That's very hard. Right, but is not just in meditation.

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       It's just the ability to, to relax in these really uncomfortable positions. Strength Them. It's good for you though, is good for you. You can. There's other, I do it rarely though. I talk a lot of shit, but I, if I take one yoga class a month, it's a lot. I do it when on my own, like before shows, I always do it. It helps you warm up, stretch out, relax my body. I think green tea, green tea and massages now just green tea. Okay. Does it energize? Got Some caffeine in I think, but I don't think it's like as much as a cup of coffee or anything. I think it's less than that, but it's probably healthier for you. You know? It's a shit. You're a [inaudible]. You ever heard that? Yeah. You'd be throw some honey in there. It's a interesting t because it gives you a different kind of stimulant. It's different than the caffeine. Sort of a coffee stimulant is a little clearer. Little clearheaded. It's not as buzzy. It's not as fucking now it's called fuck around and start a business.

Speaker 3:          01:29:55       I made some fucked up decisions, high out coffee because coffee will get you motivated to do shit. I fought in a tournament once when I was a kid. I was delivering newspapers and I was, I had been injured and I wasn't training and I decided that day of that I was going to fight the tournament after I ate two donuts and drank a big cup of coffee and I was fucking wired and I'm like, I want a cool fight. And so I entered into this tournament just because a coffee. Totally. Yeah. I don't one of want to be in like really big tournament. For me it was a u s open. I drink a red bull before I go on an age VCO taekwondo, I was a high window. You guys open. It was a, I would have never even fought. And if it wasn't for the coffee, coffee just had me so convinced that it was a fun thing to do.

Speaker 3:          01:30:41       Let's go fucking do this and coffee. Well, back then I was competing, so it was, it was really the only reason why I wasn't going to fight in a tournament that I had an injury. But the injury, like it kind of healed itself over the week that I had off and just too fucking Boston cream donuts, which is like, who knows how many and sang grams of sugars in there and a giant thing of Dunkin donuts coffee, one of those big ones, like a 16 ouncers crap. Your brains out, explosions household just opens up and it just, just the way it comes out to, it's so easy. It just all comes out. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:31:15       You know what sucks on, it's kind of on the same thing. Uh, I, uh, did one of those things where you go to the bathroom before you get in the shower, you don't flush the toilet because you don't want it. The shower, did she use that water? And I left it there. My cat has been drinking out. Fuck up. Wait, can I tell you something there that doesn't do a lot of houses aren't made that way anymore. What? Oh yeah. Well, I'm not fancy mic. Fancy person. My building's old. I'm just saying like, that doesn't always happen. You might want to flush. No, no, let go. And I flushed. It changes though. The water everywhere at my house. The whole water, the water's freezing. Freezing like 45 seconds minute. That's ridiculous. Oh yeah. I live in a old ass fucking engineering house. That's some polio. Yeah. Anyways, the cat got in it and I don't know what happened, but it came outside and there's just like Paul Shit everywhere. She's so then I didn't have anything to clean it up with except Windex and pledge shit. It smells better, you know, it's so I squirted on there. The Windex actually cleaned a lot, but then the next day I was just like looking at my floor and he's a little white dots everywhere on the floor and you can see it looks like a cat ghost walked, you know, like, oh, that's disgusting.

Speaker 2:          01:32:37       It's awful. Yeah. There's nothing quite like a Turd that you forget about and then you come back to it the next day. Oh that's, you have to flush it. And it had been sitting there stewing. You took a shit while you're on the phone. He didn't want to the person to hear the flushing and the background to know you're a human. I take so many dumps them on the phone, so I take some of my best phone conversation.

Speaker 4:          01:32:54       Have you ever had your girlfriend or wife or whatever? Like I had like two months ago, walked in and she forgot to flush and had one of those, like what I was looking at her and was like inevitable, huge Joey Dee and shit.

Speaker 2:          01:33:06       It's inevitable. I hate that. Why are we talking about poop? People drop logs, son. It's a part of life. That's what my daughter talks about. I call it now, she's two and a half. She calls it drop his log because they keep telling me, did you drop it? Log you drop a log in your body that got them dropping. Lars, when kids find out what's funny and what makes you laugh, they just repeated over and over again. So she has her own account comics. Yeah, very similar. Really the same thing. Is that a fucked up thing when someone goes to see you and you know they're going to see the same show like the next night? Just want to be like, as I'm telling the joke, we were like, and you probably, as I'm saying it, I want to stop and be like, look, I know you know where I'm going to say, but if you could just be quiet for everyone else, she'll sit on your lap.

Speaker 2:          01:33:51       Yeah, that's a weird, like I've, I've talked to people before shows. I go, dude, we love you so much for coming. See you every night that you have shows like, Yikes, what we've got to open every show totally different and it makes my material up and fucker can't tell the same jokes over and over again with the same timing. It takes a long ass time of repeating a joke too to get it effortless to the point where it looks like you're thinking it up out in the moment and when someone sees behind the curtain like that two nights in a row, it's, it's weird. I've had people yell out a punchline before, oh that's brutal. You get so nervous to take that pause that you need for whatever your joke is just for timing sake. And then they're like goats and you're like, yeah, that's a such a douchey move in PR.

Speaker 2:          01:34:32       The problem is with with youtube, like your material gets online, it takes like a long ass time to develop it. Joke. People don't know. It starts off, starts off as like it's something funny in this or something funny in this, right? I mean that's how I always started out. Like what the fuck is funny in this? There's something funny in this and that a lot of times I'll have a bunch of different ideas, different ways to go that I've written out, but, but it takes a long ass time to figure out which way I'm going to go with it. I have to do it over and over and over again. So for, if someone gets a hold of it, like in that process and then puts it up on youtube and then everybody watches it and then they come to the show and they yell out your punch line.

Speaker 2:          01:35:04       Yeah, it just doubled. Triple fucked you. They're not doing it to be dicks. Like they're so excited to be there. Yeah. There's a lot of that. And there's some people that are just douche bags and they fuck up everything they touch and they just can't help them. They are, man. That's true. You can get some toxic people. People come up to me after and they'll reference a joke I did not 20 minutes earlier and I take myself so seriously. I won't realize that they're referencing it and I'll be like, I have a bit about that. They're like, I know. That's why I just talked about that. I'm like, oh right. Do you guys want to tee shirt? That's funny. You sell merge? Yeah. What is your t shirt say? I have a bunch of them. Do you have any sexy ones? You have the Grey Cup on stuff that I don't should do that dude by that do what?

Speaker 2:          01:35:46       Daisy Duke back from the old dukes of Hazzard days. Oh yeah. Get a tee shirt with my face on it. If you go to my Facebook page, you can see my album cover. It's not sexy, but there's many, cause he's got some glamour shots online. I saw some cover your album cover. It's super, super, super glamour shot. I mean it was supposed to be like an eighties glamour shot thing as to what exactly it looks at it. It's so, no, that's not the one I'm talking about. Oh yeah, I like that. That's how powerful I like that. Eliza alive. Jesus. Your CD this out right now. Yeah, it's on iTunes. You can get it on Itunes, iTunes, the DVDs coming out. If you're anti-apple where else can they get it? Can they get it on Amazon? Your website, [inaudible] dot com powerful. Do you actually sell it as a physical CD or do you have them printed?

Speaker 2:          01:36:29       I just got him. Isn't it crazy that those students still exist? Yeah. You know what I saw is it called a drop card? Do you know what this is? No. My friend showed this to me. It's a car. You pay me for the CDI give you this card and it's so you take it home and you download it with a code. So it was like a free download, that gift card drop card. That's cool. That is cool. You know? Do you think, I mean it's only a matter of time before a solid state media just disappears. Right? Like actual physical media, like a physical DVD or a physical, right? No, and I don't buy cds anymore. I stopped. I just, everything on Itunes, I just buy him to use it to snort cocaine, cocaine off. So bad ass, dude. You know what I love when, when I'm in a fucking, like there was a song the other day, I couldn't figure out who it was.

Speaker 2:          01:37:10       And so I put up that Shizam thing. Oh, I have that. Yeah. There's a, if there were folks who don't know, it's a program that lets you a your plate. There's a music playing in the background. You, you press Shizam it listens to the music, sends the information now tells you who sung the song, what the song's title is in [inaudible] she has you will a link that you could buy it on iTunes right there and going to play it. You can play it right there too. You can play it. Just press play and it's playing on your phone. It's fucking incredible. And it's called [inaudible] and I've just been buying songs like that and just add them to my iPhone. This all but I love the song. Bam. Is there a way on apple, like an apple on iTunes? Like when I download music to work out, I always like to do like top 40 like what's on the radio. Is there where you can search on Itunes, like top 40 hip hop songs and it'll bring it off? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Probably. Yeah. Well,

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       all you have to do is to look at it looked like the top 10 lists and stuff like that. You know, like maybe like just in hip hop. I don't want like billboard. I want absolutely. You were into hip hop. What kind of laptop do you like? Do you like old shit? Like Gangstarr uh, thanks. I did. It depends.

Oh, okay. Whatever's on that. Can she only no radio edits of songs? I don't know if there's a curse word. I don't know what cause that's the only kind of music

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       you listen to really. I'm in the car lot. It's an excuse. Like in the car you can only get top 40 you never know who's listening. Ipod, I don't like listening to it unless I'm working out. So I only like fast songs. I can work out to my girl talk or something. I don't know. I've been hearing a lot of people, the girl talks could, yeah. I haven't been hearing a lot of people saying that the podcast is the best for working out nowadays because it's, he's like, you're not getting lost in music and board. You know, cause I always stop and take it out and switch it if it's a bad song. Right around your workout. I got a lot of Twitter messages from dudes listen to us when they're doing the workouts and driving to a lot of driving people. Yeah. I cannot listen to music.

Speaker 2:          01:41:32       I couldn't listen to someone talk really. I've listened to a bunch of lectures and I've listened to a few podcasts too. I listen to a cool Graham Hancock podcast recently that was listening to that while I was driving around. So be able to focus off it over the sound of my heart bursting out of my chest while I run. So you can only listen to music as I was saying. Yeah, I see what you're saying when you're working out. Yeah. You know what else works that I found this out two days ago. I was at the gym and I have the TVS attached to the treadmill. They won't like the nature channel and I was watching a cheetah run down a gazelle and they slowed it down and I got so into it cause you don't know what's going to happen. And I found myself going faster watching this cheetah and it was super animalistic and he got him in the end and I was happy for him.

Speaker 2:          01:42:14       I felt bad for the, for the antelope that antelope had to die eventually. Yeah. Like he's going to live forever and cure cancer. You don't know that. I know those antelopes. They never give a shit. They just welfare. They eat and poop. That's all they do. Nothing gets done in the antelope world, just running around, running from Cheetahs and shit. There's just run. It was a rush on that. Did you see that video that someone put on line of a African hunters like recent? Within the last 50 60 years. I got the, I believe it's a video from the 60s of a hunting with spears, hunting elephants and hippos with spears. Oh Dude, it is a fucking rat. I don't want to see hippos. I to stagers animal in the animal kingdom. You know they're giant pigs. I did not know that. Yeah. Hippos. Hippos are in the pig family.

Speaker 2:          01:43:04       They're giant fucking mean. Pigs eat people are they fucking warriors of the videos of, I don't know what the name of the warriors are because they know they were wearing a merit like they're wearing like t shirts and shit cause we gave them to them probably. Yeah. Yeah. We gave them to them in exchange for filming them. Fucking up these hippos shit spears. If you want to find it good. Go to twitter.com/joe Rogan. This thing was recorded on January 4th. Um, and so I'm pretty sure I put it up on January 3rd. You should. You should check it out cause it's a trip. It's, it's so hard to watch. It's really freaky cause they think they, it takes a long ass time to kill an elephant with spears. Sure. I had it sounds off and they all like, they all work together. Like the whole tribe, we'll work together to take down these animals.

Speaker 2:          01:43:48       So they have like, you know, literally thousands of people circling these and they're choking them off. They make this big circle and then they forced the animals into the center and then they spear him to death. I guess they gotta eat. You gotta eat and there's no other way to do it. You know, they have, they have no options. It just go to the store. I think it would just devolve. Why don't you have electricity yet? You're so stupid. It's amazing that they really are still living the way they lived thousands of years ago. I went to Africa a couple of times when we went on a safari and you get to like hang out with the mass. I wars and like see how they live and like, obviously you pay them and they give you a tour and a little bit of it's fake. But there's like sanctions, like in the Serengeti, they can't go around killing like lions and stuff so they have to eat like normal, like they can't do it.

Speaker 2:          01:44:30       Like you have to be a super rural tribe to do that. Like a lot of them, even though they live in that land, they're not allowed to kill the animals cause so the ones that are super rural, they are allowed to, there's no one like regulating that. But like closer to like where like the capitals or wherever we were, we're more tourists go wow. They're not allowed to do. There's a great story, not a great story, but a fascinating, a terrible story. Terrible story. There was a guy who was on safari and he was in the shower and two lions came in and killed them and dragged him out of the shower. Wow. That is terrible. Fucking imagine taking a shower. What? You know what man? He's on some safari on a hunting safari. It was, we saw that movie hangover movie hangover when he walked into the, there's a tiger in the bathroom.

Speaker 2:          01:45:13       Yeah, it's totally the same time. Totally is. You say, Hey, what are you doing there? And then they go, you gotta be real calm about, hey, what are you doing there? That guy, that's the guy that's seen a lot of bears. That's so funny. That was me. You would see dripping from the pis coming out of my ankles long for the fucking bear. Got to where he was. I would be ranting. I was a on that bear's head. Jo, have you seen these helmets that these motorcycle jacket guys? Uh, where nowadays, like my friend, he took off his helmet and it had like this big glass part over it and he was just put it up and they had like the sunglass thing that it goes, you know, it comes down, it opens that up and he's just blaring his iPhone music and I'm like, what is that?

Speaker 2:          01:45:55       He, the whole thing is like a Bluetooth Stereo cone. Like he says, he puts it on God. Then what? What happens if he can't hear fucking thing? It's like, he's like, it's like being in Tron. He's like, you're just, that guy is crazy. Yeah, it's a helmet. It's cutting out. One of his sense is I took a photo of it. That's the legal, their iPod on your earphones on and your car. So I can't believe that would be legal. Yeah. Doesn't make any sense because first of all, you have to wear a seatbelt, but fucking motorcycles don't have any seat belts. It's impossible. Should check why that's the worst thing that could happen. And it's stuck on the bike. Is that things rolling and tumbling and fuck. Yeah. Better. If you can slide. If you can lay the bike down and you just skid, you know, if you have the right clothing on, if you know how to ride a bike, maybe like a CD, it could be tethered, doc. You don't lose it would you just don't want to get run over by your own bike and pinned underneath it. Smashed and have it fall on top of you a bunch of times.

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       Over and over. Yeah, put down a hill. Motorcycle accidents are some scary shit, man. It's like trine and see this the same Bluetooth thing that a answer calls turn up the volume. That's so insane. Cause take your hand off the fucking motorcycle, right. Handles and presses. Stupid Button. Fiddle with it on the side of your head. Guarantee you someone's going to die because they're trying to make a call and it's fucking piece of shit and I ain't ringing. Oh my God, that's a horrible idea. That's ridiculous. People are crazy motherfuckers. You know it has to be a trip though. The one like 120 miles an hour while you're blaring led Zepplin and your high high on se survive. It must be the shit. But I mean you've got to be a reckless motherfucker to want to do that. That's like only appeals to people with Toxoplasma.

Speaker 3:          01:47:35       That's like a hundred percent toxoplasma activity. What's that? What's that cat parasite thing? You ever heard of this fucking, we talk about it way too much of the podcast. I apologize everybody who has to hear this again, but there's a crazy cat parasite that affects human beings and makes them more reckless and makes him reckless. It makes a women more sexually promiscuous and make some more, more planning. I would get it from cats. People get it from touching cat feces or being around fields where cats and something happens and they touch the, the, you know, the cat feces in a field and she get it from eating cat. Yes. She can get it. Yeah, definitely. And you have to, especially a cat that shit's outside. Those are the cats that are dangerous. And this is what happens. A rat gets it and it affects the rat.

Speaker 3:          01:48:20       And what it makes the rat do is it makes the rat sexually attracted to the smell of cat piss. So the rat start following where the cats live and like want to be around the cats so that it could easily get killed. And then they would transfer it to the cat and the cat's transfer it to people. It's really sad. Yeah. And people transferred back to rats. It for recreation, not possible to cure. Yes. But here's where it gets crazy. Huge whore. Well for women and makes you do that. And for men it makes you much more aggressive and reckless. And it's, they say it slows your reaction time down too. So it was just like a bunch of juice heads and hookers that was like in Miami nightclub. It's like Brazil. Brazil is 66% infected with toxoplasma. Very good look like literally. And Yeah, the love to fucking love to fight.

Speaker 3:          01:49:06       I mean it literally defines the culture. I don't know if they were doing that. Anyway, this is a thing that's been around for a long time. Yeah. Well that's one of the things. It's connected to places where people have a lot of wild cats. Wow. Yeah. It's directly connected and it is an incurable parasite that changes human behavior and it's a fact. It's not a conspiracy theory. This is a legitimate mainstream fact. It's so strange. I know people that don't have that, that act that way. So you might have, it might have. So it could be a learned behavior after people that have, there's a whole lot of factors in cash. Baggery that's a good question. I don't know. I don't know if he could pass to kids illegal think somehow or another they would have to get cat shit. If you want your kid make the football team, why?

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       Don't know if it works that way. But one of the things they found out within men was that the, there was a, um, a disproportionate amount of people, um, like when they had, um, uh, soccer teams that would compete in the World Cup. The teams that made it to the finals all had high rates of Toxoplasma in their countries. And they think that this, the recklessness of this bacteria, like what it does, it makes you like disregard like a, your safety and do reckless shit. I get disproportionate number of people who crash it on motorcycles are infected with toxo plasma. And so they, they connect it to the connected it to successful soccer teams. And there's like a real debate about this. And it may be one of the reasons why these teams are so successful at soccer. They're so aggressive and crazy as it because they're infected by Toxoplasma.

Speaker 3:          01:50:33       Because a lot of, um, a lot of athletes from Brazil, a lot of athletes from a lot of south American countries, poor area, a lot of wildcats are 50 or 50 million Americans are in fact it. Wow. Yeah, it's pretty crazy. It's the current piece, which is like an alien. It's like an alien that's rewiring our brains. That's awesome. It's fucking crazy. Pretty soon we're going to start making pyramids. Watch. That's what it is. Imagine it was like some kind of thing that gets you all, well, if there's a little parasite, parasites evolve, right? If you believe in evolution, you believe they weren't exactly this way the whole time they became what they are now. Everything became what it is now and evolve from something to something else. Something new parasite that evolves. I mean HIV, right. When remember when aids came around, there was something that came and there's just some new shit. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:51:22       You hear about that guy that got cured with aids. You got stem cells. These stem cells and then cured is HIV. It disappeared. Where Jamba juice at? Jamba juice. The good idea. And how come this isn't in the news? Uh, it is. Yeah, it isn't. It isn't like damn. It's really recent. Like a month ago. Three weeks ago. Yeah. He's actually been cured of HIV using stem cells like it was, I don't know. I don't know the details on it, but it's pretty much been accepted that they figured out how it slacking on your aids research. There's a cure for cancer and it's in Mexico at a clinic give you, they give you weed and what isn't. Yeah. There's, there's some things that they're willing to do in Mexico, they'd probably work. There's a lot of people that have said that, um, blood transfusions, like full blood transfusions and, and other treatments they do to blood.

Speaker 3:          01:52:06       It was a bunch of different treatments that are willing to do in Mexico. I think I'd be willing to die before I'd be willing to let a Mexican doctor with no sterilization putting a needle in me. I know dudes have gone to Mexico for surgery because my many fighters, no MMA fighters, they're um, they're cheap. Are you friends with a bunch of MMA fighters? Like I know that some of them, yeah. Yeah. Cool. Train. Yeah. Train. Yeah. How do they feel about getting hit in the face so much? Well, I'm the smart ones know that it's just a, you got to limit the amount of times you get hit. It's very important to use defense first. It'd be very smart about why, but you know, they also know that there's some flights we're just getting nailed, you know, it's just nothing you can do about it.

Speaker 3:          01:52:47       Then you're talking about about football earlier. I mean I don't think like octagon fighting has been and all that stuff has been around or as popular as long as football. So are they going to be the same as football players? Like are they going to end up with poor Gehrig's disease and depends on their style. It depends on when they get out. Depends on how much punishment they take at the end of their career because the end of the career is where guys get really beat up. That's what happened with Muhammad Ali happens with a lot of fighters say the reaction time slows. They don't know when to get out of the game. And then they take some fights that they probably shouldn't take. And then they get some, they get some serious injuries and they don't know when to quit. And they keep going. And those are the guys that wind up in real big trouble, in my opinion, is a Lou Gehrig's disease.

Speaker 3:          01:53:23       It doesn't mean it's a Nate and it just triggers later, you know, Louis Lou Gehrig's disease can, it can be triggered later. It can be something that just happens to you, but it also can be trauma induced. Okay. So it can be, you know, there's, there's a bunch of different ways, like Stephen Hawking's has Lou Gehrig's disease and I don't, I don't think that he was, he might've been, I might've played soccer or something like that. Who knows. I'm a fighter before he found the books before he found all that study. And then, but um, w what happens is when guys get a lot of repeated brain injuries there, their brains start producing like defective proteins and they're, they're, they're literally their body just like eventually just shuts down and just stops working. It starts like misfiring left and right. It could just really, really creepy how come on I watch and, and they fighting, they look like they take breaks simultaneously.

Speaker 3:          01:54:13       Like when they're like in this headline, it looks like they're almost taking a rest. Is that like a code? Like, I'm going to take a two second breather, right? Don't hit me while I'm doing this. Well, if you're tired and you sense it, the other guy's tired and he's not moving, you might do that. It might take a little break then wouldn't it as an as a killer? Wouldn't it be like that was when we go, ugh. But you might be willing to forego that just for a couple seconds of recovery if you think you're going to make another big explosion. Right? You met something timed out, you know, you're like, all right, does a minute and a half left in this round? I'm taking this mother fucker down, but right now I'm gonna tell you a little break. Do they ever talk to each other? Sometimes we talked shifts. Oh, sometimes the one time that was the weirdest one was his dude war machines fighting this Guy Jay Rock and uh, Jay Rock and war machine became really good friends on the ultimate fighter.

Speaker 3:          01:54:57       And then they had a fight each other. I mean, really good friends. And it was a fucking war, a bloody horrible war where they were talking to each other while I was going. I'm like, fuck man. It fucking hurt. Like, yeah, sorry dude. Like saying shit like that while while they're fighting, it was really crazy. And then it's a mind fuck. And yeah, and then at the end when it was all over, they were super emotional and crying and hugging each other. It was, it was hockey player raising fight each other. I mean, I guess, I don't think it was like this, not like 15 fucking minutes of beaten the shit out of each other is not the same thing. Those hockey fights, they can't get that traction, you know? And it was a, it was a vicious fight in an ended with a brutal Tko and there's was like crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:55:32       Like it was, it was so charged with emotion, you know? And then when he, when I interviewed him after the fight was over, he was crying and talking about how hard it was and what they were saying to each other, why they were in there. And I was like, Whoa, that's got, oh yeah, that's fucked up. You know? If it was like a thousand years ago, you had to kill him, right? Yeah. That's what happened. Right. That's what they used to make them do in those fucking, those Roman cuts. It's us 500 years from now, the new room. I think Americans just like Rome, it's crazy. They're sort of not the same buildup, same decline lap bands. That was the beginning of the end. You fucking fat cunt, stop eating. Just get your shit together. You have to be 50 pounds overweight. Do you think they give it to you if you were like, you want to lose 10 pounds?

Speaker 3:          01:56:15       I thought about that. I've got like some problem areas and I was like, maybe I just get a lap band like a small one. You were guaranteed you're not the first person to think this a little bit. Did a lot of girls like sleep talk about that though. Is it jokes? I know. No, no, that girls do talk about that on the back dated girls that actually talk about that shit all the time. Like I'm going to go in and get the car. There's a girl that I dated a long time ago whose best friend got the light bow and she did not need the [inaudible]. She did not need the light. Oh, she just needed to work out a little bit. The girl did. It didn't work out at this rather than she got ruined man. They lumpy deer up, doesn't it? I could be wrong about this one after they do it.

Speaker 3:          01:56:49       Don't you kind of have no control over wearing that you made how they do it. They just don't. They don't. You have a hunch. No control over where your fat cells grow back. I don't know. Replacing one problem here with another. So you could get huge fat arms. No, but he kept no blood or huge bite or a huge buck like a spider. But like you know, spiders have huge, oh yeah. Don't let them do that. Don't let them suck fat out of your people if you're willing to turn to that. Like I can understand if you're older and it's a serious problem, you've been struggling all your life, but if you're selling like 21 year old girl that works at Hooters, just hit the gym for an hour. You know, I was watching this thing online about these two French brothers who are twins who became plastic surgery junkies and they're deformed now.

Speaker 3:          01:57:31       Have you seen those places? Yeah. Pull it up. Brian. A French famous twins, plastic surgery now awful. Just write French famous twins, plastic surgery nightmare. They were stars of some television show, you know, I guess back in the eighties or so and now they're like 50 and they look like they look like monsters. Like these poor guys, like they've got some sort of a psychological defense. I got there. Kind of like the cat people. Yeah, exactly. They have all sorts of facial implants and they have all sorts of fillers in their face and their heads are deformed. It is. It's so Uber does and that's what they used to look like. They look fine. Yeah. He's a little weird looking but not like he is now. Looks like that mask from screen. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. It looks like I'm the kid from masks, that movie mask. They both have pouty lips before and after. I know what it's not that given how they look before that Beverly Hills show to that one bitch that has the crazy lip and it's like the housewives large mouth anyway though. Yeah, but she's got crafty

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       shit going on with her lips. Somebody should have told her like, hey, I ain't, you know, that doesn't make you look any better. That's it. Pretty easy. It's really the problem I think with when you do that is your face. It has, whether you're a symmetrical or not, your face as a certain symmetry to it. Anything you do to any part of it, you have to bounce out. The rest of the more you try to balance it, the worse it gets. Well, there's a mathematical principle to it. It's called the FIBONACCI Fibonacci sequence and then it works on faces like talking, when someone gets a nose job, you're like, what the fuck is going on when your head that's like supposed to be this big, this is the way, you know there's a grand design for it. Sure sounds that way. There's that one show.

Speaker 2:          01:59:17       I don't, I can't watch it because it upsets me. Bridal plasty Oh, I haven't seen it. It's addicting. You would you like it? What is it? Explain it to me. They go through, they go through challenges. They each girls or is engaged and I don't know who's marrying these crazy people. I don't know who would, but each girl was engaged and they do different challenges in order to win plastic surgery procedures all leading up to your big day and you can win bouquets. You can win nose jobs, light bulb, whatever you want. So basically her husband's marrying a crazy doll that looks nothing like you know, God that remember that show on Fox where they used to work them all? My God, that was insane. But those people were really awful looking. Yeah they were. But I mean fuck you know, you're getting them on a slippery slope with some people. That was good shit. Like to fix her teeth and you know, you don't get to be manager at the at and t store if you don't look your best. When you look good you get to be manager. That's when it happens. That's when it goes down. What do you, if you're at the 18 store, how do you, how do you explain to people that the iPhone just to fucking drops off everywhere? What would you say? What did I say if you were working with at and t store?

Speaker 2:          02:00:21       Well, I have no idea. I never really thought about it. I would probably say it's, I mean they're all, I don't know, but we're adding towers all the time. Why are you asking me this all the time? If you went to the att store and the there was like a sexy woman and CEO was talking to you and telling you and trying to calm you down from the issue, do you think you'd be more likely to just let it go? Do you think you would get smitten? I think you would. I think he lives in his like laughing the guy, we're hot. I'd be like, yeah, I don't want you to think I'm crazy. Really? You would do that. So if there was like some fucking handsome Clark Kent Looking Motherfucker, you would be more willing to listen to their corporate bullshit about why your phone keeps dropping off.

Speaker 2:          02:01:05       Beat me if you were hot or not. Really. Just a light beating. Choking. Just so like, I'll like throttling half throttle. Yeah. Let's play a game called fake rape girls like that. I'm just now thinking about law and order. Svu episodes are about, there's a guy in Oklahoma that got arrested recently because he shot his wife or his girlfriend. There was some sort of a, a, a, a sex thing. Like he would hold the gun up to her head while he's banging her. Oh, and it accidentally went off because he thought it was blanks. No, because he accidentally shot her in the head. Yeah. She said something stupid. He just came, oh fuck you. And then call the cops and said it was a mistake again. This made a stupid and there's no place for him in society. If you're willing to put a loaded gun to someone's head while you have sex with them, knock it till you track girl.

Speaker 2:          02:01:57       You never know. Some people are little gangster shit do that while Scarface is playing in the background. Damn. That's some people like to live on the edge, you know? And I mean I don't have to go to jail for that. It wasn't, it was an accident. Yeah. He goes to jail for being retarded. He has to go to jail. That's where I belong. Yeah. You shoot somebody in the head, you got to go to jail. Yeah. There's not many circumstances where it's okay. Well totally. If they could prove that he came after he shot her, then he definitely goes to jail. I don't think, can't RB carbing taste at it, but it had great benefits. This lube was shut into a dead man.

Speaker 2:          02:02:38       Lot of pineapple. Guy Bends his knees. He's touching his fingers to it. No one's talking to wait for the results. Who's dead? Who did with the Jackie later into them with that cat poop disease. Toxoplasma taste funny. If I could've thought of the name of the disease versus asking you acting out, tasting seaman, be careful with your dog. I'm telling you. Don't let them get their toxo plasma. She doesn't go outside to her brother. She doesn't. She have her yard. She goes outside. But just make sure she's on a ride. Other people's cats that go outside? No. Yeah, she is not good. Where in the garage? Um, don't tell me what part of the country is it, but are there wraps? They're here. Here. Are there rats in your neighborhood? No, I got rats.

Speaker 2:          02:03:32       The rats are there. You just don't know. There's lots everywhere. Let's just bet on who she's probably going to start fucking you and your sleep. Well, she's more of an affection, love, hug kind of dog. Don't let her out to PE. She'll get excited and start holding my arm. Really tell you that she has to pee once a month if I like really push it and don't want her out cause I'm doing something. How strange she does it to like, like she gets so excited and worked up and weave and then she'll just be like, how do you a workout when you go on the road with her? I don't work out on the road. No, no, no that's not what you mean. How do you work it out? Like when you go on the road to take it with you? Because I was on the road so much, I was like I need, I need something he commanded.

Speaker 2:          02:04:17       So I got her and she and she travels with you on a plane. She's like this, she's silent. That's awesome. I want to travel with being on stage. You're on stage. The other comics. Oh that's cool. And she's a really good girl. That's nice. Do you have a cool little friend? Cause she could have been crazy. And when you bring her on a plane, he just put her in between your seat. Is that how you doing it or my feet go. What if people are allergic to dogs now round you fuck them. She sat sneaker on, but for the most part I pay for her and if you're allergic will, you'll set nigger on my bag that I have for it looks like a duffle bag and it's got a mesh side like she can breathe. I'll throw my coat over and just walk on.

Speaker 2:          02:04:58       The people that check your ticket or not the same as the people security and northern St people to gate. I figured that out. So you just walk on. They don't want to know. If you don't do that then what do you have to do? Pay 100 bucks or a hundred it depends. Hundred 50 doesn't really the scheme. The laser, you know, it's a great scheme. When I moved out here, I had to move my cats out and they lost my cats for like two hours. Like they didn't let me have it with me. I had to put it into like under the thing under the thing. I would never do that ever again and then I was thinking about traveling with or bring my dog to Ohio when I went back and they s besides, besides it being so expensive they had, the vet told me that it's really bad for the dogs, the air pressure under or in the cabinet under the thing.

Speaker 2:          02:05:40       I bet. I bet it's cold. It's cold on the floor where she goes up a little blank. It's really, really cold down there. There's that creepy feeling when you get close to the window and you realize how cold it is out there and coming back from Canada was a trip because we were, we were almost stranded. We came so close to me and stranded. The snow was just starting to start. A blizzard was hitting's recently and if we had been an hour later we would have been stuck in Canada for days. I'm sure. No, this was a different one. This was a recent one that's Macho Montreal. Montreal's beautiful city. Canada itself was amazing country. It's gorgeous and Canadians are really nice. The nicest fucking people. A lot of crap for Americans. I dated Canadian recently. This is why I have all this to say. They're very nice and super masculine.

Speaker 2:          02:06:24       Not Fatty at all. Nice. So Canadians out the, just want to let you know. No, we're done. I'm just saying more what happened, but he's just giving Ya. They do say she's giving you a thumbs up on your product. I think for, it's always easy to make fun of Canada, but great country. Nice people. Very friendly. Yeah. But it's not easy to make fun of Canada. It's me. Easy to make fun of how fucking cold it is in some spots, but like, you know, as far as like, like the people there and they're slipping. I had some of the nicest fucking people ever live above this country, filled with homicidal maniacs, you know, Michigan. How about that dude? Did you see those Garrett living above Mexico? Do you see those photos of Michigan? Was it you that posted it? That shit's scary. Like a Michigan decline. A Michigan in photos. It's a, it's on Joe's Twitter. Amazing photo of somebody tweeted it. I retired. It's all these photos of like ancient buildings and you know, been around Michigan's, it's like the 17, 18 hundreds all fallen apart and abandoned now because the economy is falling apart. Like abandoned library filled with books, abandoned police headquarter with all the photos here. Detroit, Michigan in general. I think it was all Detroit, Detroit, those towns. I was actually,

Speaker 3:          02:07:37       I was in Upper Michigan recently. Second time in a year. I'm not bragging. Give a fuck. I don't know. Fuck time travel up to northern Michigan. It's such another world up there. It looks, if you took a picture and took out the cars, you wouldn't be able to tell me what decade it was. I agree to all of that. Once for a, did a college and all of that, Michigan, who was, you know where all of that is to middle of nowhere. They gave me terrible directions to drive there for, there's no gps back then. It's back in the golden days, a comedy and I had to drive to this fucking college and stand on top of two. Um, there were like a cafeteria tables that was the stand and one of them had a mic on one end and a speaker on the other accounts. And there was another speaker that was on the other table and I can go back and forth in between the two tables if I paid attention for then step on a crack and punch through and fall.

Speaker 3:          02:08:26       I'm not kidding. It was fucking most ridiculous thing ever. And then, uh, there's no opening act. Of course it's just me. So I go onstage and immediately start getting heckled and they're all football players. It's a football college. So it's like all these animals. Well I start to like give these guys shit. They were like, it was good natured heckling with, you know, a lot of faggot talk and stuff like that. So I go to the guy, you know, I, I go, whatever. I said I, you know, I've made fun of them. And the, the guy who ran the college came up to me and said, I just want to let you know that we are not allowing swears. You are not allowed to swear. I was like, this is ridiculous. These guys are allowed to swear you fucking faggot. We love to yell at you. Fucking faggot at me. And so then I turned it around and said something about, you know, you guys are old enough to go to war. You're old enough to die for your country, right? But this guy right here says that, I can't swear in front of you. Somehow know that you can't handle it and then give a fuck.

Speaker 3:          02:09:19       It's fucking crazy. And I was joking around by, I go, let's fucking trashed this place. And I'll bunch it. Dude screamed and one dude stood up and picked up a chair and then the guy came up to the table and he goes, listen, listen, listen, do whatever you want. We'll deal with the consequences later. You perform your normal act as you normally do. And I'm like, oh, can you see how I could swear now we can swear. Calm down. Everybody calm down. They were like ready to fight. I was half kidding. But I was like really instigating. I was really instigating because you know, they were boards and they were in the middle of nowhere and this guy was annoying as fuck. And I was going, look, you know, I just came here to entertain you guys. Never comedy show. That was the thing. They used to sell you, they'll sell you to anyone.

Speaker 3:          02:10:00       All this is like Barry Katz as agency. It was New York entertainment and they would just fucking sell you, whoever. They could sell you to any colleges. They would just sell you two and then he would deal with it once you get there. And I did a Naca show and they got to see that I was dirty and like everybody had, you know, they said, well if you do, you know, Naca and they know that you're dirty, then it will limit the amount of colleges that you go to. But I was like, I can't make a fake second act right. You know, and, and just to do it, to do colleges. So they knew I was dirty. So somehow or another got sold at this college that didn't know, but they were the most savage of all the colleges I've ever done ever. And they didn't want me to switch the one guide.

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       It's not the college. I think it was, it was their policy because they had all these fucking animals living in the middle of Michigan. You know, we want to keep him to keep him calm, keep him calm. I didn't know need for swears so many colleges the other last year. And the thing about colleges is like if comedy club you can go, you can see what this, you couldn't ask your friends with the stages is like, cause some colleges you have no clue what it's going to be like. You don't, if you're gonna be in a theater, an amphitheater outside in the parking lot, a cafeteria, you don't know and you get there, you just hope it's going to be decent. Did a college wrestling Canada, it was weird. I hadn't done one in a long time and it was like uh, adults and college kids mixing together.

Speaker 2:          02:11:07       It's always weird when they like come wandering it from the community. Yeah, you can be 18 or you know, you can, you know, 18 and above. It was fine, but it was, it's very strange because a lot of college people, you know, you forget when you're 30 years old, you're 40 years old or whatever. Even if you lived all this life, these kids haven't lived at all. It's tricky because you can't talk about dating as you would normally or jobs or sex cause it's just not, they don't know that yet. Some do, but you're dealing with a huge percentage that don't, I mean there's hip kids in every level of high school and every level of college that would make great audience members in any comedy club. There's kids that are 14 that get us such as, yes, you're right. It was such a small percentage.

Speaker 2:          02:11:46       But in college, man, you'd be surprised that the number from 14 to college is not that different. There are a lot of them the same. They're like little kids. Some of them are hip, so I don't know what's going on in the world. Some of them, you know? No, but, and another thing they like to do at colleges is elected. Go PC on you and fucking point out when you're being racist or point out when you're being sexist. You know what though? I think they're smarter. I enjoy college has because it gives me a chance. You're not placating Joe public. These are kids that are very close to the realm of academia that we'll get a reference that we'll get something about school or they're so close or they remember it and it's a nice exercise. Yeah, I think it's because it's easy to get a car if you're in the middle of nowhere and you get a bunch of like, I don't want to try not to offend anyone, but like normal guys that this is like they're doing it on Friday night.

Speaker 2:          02:12:29       We're going to get drunk, see the comedian and go, fuck. It's a little bit easier. It's a cake walk. You could, while they're trying to have fun too, we're trying to have fun, just trying to have a good time. There's something to be said for that. I know a lot of idiots that are a lot of fun to hang out with and they don't want to think about the moral and fucking wiki leaks, but you know, have a chat, have a jack and coke with them. We get a couple of pounds in was like you give each other a few high fives in there. Good company. You know, there's a lot of people that aren't very deep thinkers that I enjoy hanging around with, but I don't know what you're saying. There's a wedding ring, Brian. Shut the fuck up.

Speaker 2:          02:13:07       Don't get it. He's a mess. Oh dare you. It's a wedding ring. He's making a wedding ring out of the court. But why Brian, that was, he's laying off what you were just talking about and I was acting like I sit down me. Oh, so marriage. Have you ever seen the wonderful whites of West Virginia? It's a must say. Oh, we'll give you a copy of the DVD as you leave is a documentary on this family that lives in West Virginia. It is one of the craziest fucking things you've ever seen in your life. This wild family that just starts oxycontin and goes in and out of jail and everybody's all, you have to get everything I'm doing tonight and watch that. Fabulous. It's fabulous. They are. They are. And there's don't skip the behind the scenes interviews too cause the long in depth interviews with each of each of the people that they, they do the show with our fucking fabulous as well on my iPod or listened to all work out.

Speaker 2:          02:13:56       Fuck it. I'm sure you can buy it on iTunes and listen to on my iPod on Bob Guarantee you. It's just genius though, man. It's just, this family is just completely, totally insane. And they live in West Virginia and they just, it was just like ancestors after ancestor generation after generation fucking criminals, criminal, just straight criminals. I mean they're just crazy. They're there and they're all like famous in that town for being nuts. Yeah. So they had an interview all like different sheriffs and all these different towns folk and all these different people that know them and then they all say the same thing. These people are just crazy, wild and good for nothing. And none of them gonna amount to nothing. It's one old lady. She goes and they go, what do you want? What do you want to happen when he dies? She goes, when I dare fucking, I want you to blow.

Speaker 2:          02:14:40       We'd smoke in buffet says snort pills off my head. Let's have a fucking party. It's uncomfortable when people talk that way. I don't know man. It's pretty fucking awesome. I wanted to hang out with her. I wanted to go drink it with her. That's all I thought of when she said that. When she said, how are you going to die? I want, I'm going to boast. Weeds. Moon. Yes. Snort pills off my head. I'm like, I want to fucking hang out with his lady. That awful Mazda Road House. It's like a terrible, that is so fake like that. This is a carnival fake reality show called Mas roadhouse on like TLC group. No, it's better. It's on true TV, TV, TV, but it's true TV. It's network. It's a network that sounds like it's real, but everything on it. It's like a spray. So shitty on there.

Speaker 2:          02:15:28       It's like this bar in Dallas, but the mom, she talks like this. I don't give a fuck, and she's like this old lady and it's scripted, but she's still like that. All those scripted reality shows they're fucking up, man. You just need to follow those people like they did. But the show with the whites of West Virginia, there's no scripted reality man. They just followed him for a year and in a year they got just gold, gold, gold, engraved. They all died at the end. No, you want to keep them alive and come up with a cart to go and make it. Three d three d. What would happen? You'd eat, how would they use it? Through me, my school over here. Cherry flavor. You've got to watch. It's pretty full. Most Johnny Knoxville produced it. Apparently he found out about it and had to be a part of this.

Speaker 2:          02:16:10       He just had to have to let people know. I saw him the other day. What did you think? And you think, whoa, Johnny. It was everything to him. Just think you won't even sign. Yeah, no, he didn't. No, he didn't look healthy. Really. I can't imagine someone that does that for a living would look healthy. Debt to get fucked up by that ball. Shit. That shit. That is ridiculous. I can't believe you did that. Okay, so crazy. Yeah, he's crazy. They're all crazy. They're so crazy. I mean crazy. You easily could have died from that, from anything they do. The boldo fucking Amen. You got work hit you when you cut your goddamn blind fold on Shit, man. You're a movie star. Do you know your movies? I know you want to be legit, but fuck man. I mean how many bones is he broken his entire course of doing that show?

Speaker 2:          02:16:55       Would that help look into in general, does that help? Yeah, it's probably me. Would you rather take a beating trunk? Fuck yeah. You're numb when you're drunk. US, man. I think maybe if I was sober I might be able to move a little bit better and some of the punishment rather be silver. That's what we're going to take a beating. That's why, but you're not going to do much to fight off a bowl. That's why a lot of the people in the titanic that survived because they were drunk and wailing or warm. What the fuck are you talking about? The water kills you almost instantly. You're making shit survive. That dude. Only the people that didn't go in the water. No, no, no. The window. It's no people in the water survived. I don't know about that man. Really quite drunk drive. I saw the ones that survive because there's so much more relaxed.

Speaker 2:          02:17:36       We should look that up because I'm pretty sure that was even a premise in the movie was that Leonardo Dicaprio. Dot. Cause he was in the water and he left her on the route. Yeah, that's what it was. You fucking queer. You should've had a shot. He shouldn't have snapped me at the back. You shouldn't have snapped me at the bio. You still be alive. Did you know like 98% of the women survived the titanic because women were allowed. Sorry. Wow. I mean you think like a lot of people die. You didn't know that. Did you see that cruise ship in Antarctica that got fucked up last week? Did you see that? It got hit by a 35 foot wave and it's smashed the window of the boat and leaked all over the electronics to electronics. I'll short it out and they couldn't drive the boat.

Speaker 2:          02:18:22       Who's new loads? We're fucked. They had no power and they creep in on like an a some sort of a backup engine or whatever the fuck they had to do. But they like, they had a creep in that they have the video of this, this boat getting hit by waves. Oh it is fucking terrifying. It's like a cork in a Jacuzzi. Is Bobbin just completely out of control. I did a semester at sea last year of college and so it's a giant, it's an old cruise ship that they've converted. It's like they strip it down and it's a, it's a college basically. And you go around the world. What? It's crazy. Oh, what's it called? The program's called semester at sea and our ship was the SSE universe. Holy Shit. So you lived in a boat for a year, four months. Four to five months I think. And so you went to all these crazy countries and you're on, you know, you're crossing these huge oceans for like days at a time, but the group that went after us, like there's a certain degree that your boat can't go unless we're in the Earl said, oh, cap size, and they have footage.

Speaker 2:          02:19:16       They were all in the news. They were caught like the storm and there's footage of like all the kids books just sliding. And they were like one degree off from capsizing hold on. 600 kids on this thing. Oh my. They were this close. Arbs was fine,

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       but I was like, wow. Yeah, it was off. Brian, pull that video up, see if you can find it. It was on my Twitter, but it's a cruise ship. Antarctica hit by monster waves, but there's a, when they were trying to rescue people off the boat, they got video of it. Like one another belt came in close. No, no, no. Nobody's, nobody's screaming or anything like that. No one's Bolton got a bullet hole in her head. Right. Cruise ship, wave Antarctica. But in Antarctica, and it'd be really recent. It's a December article or December video that's a fucking tripping. It's so terrifying. This fucking boat. It's just bobbing back and forth. It makes you realize like you're dealing with, you know, like you're insanely deep water there,

Speaker 12:         02:20:10       Blaine, as a race, a large wave slammed into an Antarctic cruise ship with Ada, the American passengers and 77 board, but the ship's crew overcame minor damage and was heading safely back to its shedding. Old Port on Wednesday, the vessels operator said the called Dhea to declare an emergency on Tuesday reporting it had suffered engine damage and we'd heavy season 55 miles per hour. 90 key Ph wines we need was northeast of the South Shetland islands and about 500 miles, 845 kilometers from our shore here. The Argentine navy said in our statement, the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators issued statement saying the wave, the technical Dhea to cause that broken bridges window in some electrical malfunction. Kemp and knock out some communications and kill this guy and engine performance. Anyway, you get to see the whole

Speaker 3:          02:21:00       legion, Stephen Hawkin. You don't need. Yeah, guy. But how, how crazy is that? I'm imagine that's terrifying. That boat. Oh my God. I mean, look how far it goes up. Wayne's are so huge. It's so scary. And that's nothing. There's been waves higher than that. There was a wave that hit Alaska. Um, someone was just telling me about this and it was in a, I believe it was in the 1950s some fucking wave. I should look this up. Some wave. There was a thousand feet high. Something fell like a shelf, like a volcanic shelf or you know, something off a mountain fell into the water, caused this monster wave that popped up from it. And for everything from a thousand feet down in this area where it hit is just dead. There's just nothing there. Trees gone. Everything gone. A thousand feet of water. Wrap your head around that Shit, man. Can't impossible.

Speaker 3:          02:21:50       Sorry to hear how I can't quantify things. There's a fucked up video online. We talked about this on the podcast before. These kids at 900 feet above this a, there's Russian kids are walking on these beams. 900 feet above this forest. I can't even look at Shit like that. I look at anything where like when I was doing fear factor and we'd be on buildings and people would have to like do some crazy fucking stone where they had to like walk across some beam or rope or something like that across two buildings. Just looking over the edge. Your whole body. Just tangles. Well, I may have a normal life. Not, not a crazy one where I, I start. It's hard hyperventilating,

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       but my body just, everything is telling me to get the fuck away from the ledge. Unless you need the money. Yeah. Well unless you know you were in a harness and all that other good stuff. Yeah. Obviously when I'm standing there directing the show, there's no harness on me obviously. What the fuck are we talking about? Nothing. Basically the end of this show has reached because we run out of steam, but two hours in. It's hot as fuck in here too. Is it? That's just you and her together. I think it's chemistry. I smell it. It's in the air. What? Britney spears perfume. Is that what it is due or Brittany Spears perfume to you. That's kind of cool. Do you wear it to be ironic or do you like the way it smells? I love the way it smells. Really. What does it smell like?

Speaker 1:          02:23:10       Have you had to describe it? So it's kind of like a lotion, like uh, like uh oh the lotion. Cinnamon Lotion. Britney spears is like a vanilla fruity, like clean stripper. You know that perfume angel? Yeah, that's, it's gross. Right? So it was on one of my shelves from like a long time ago. Somebody left it there. What is angel? It's a perfume angel. It's every woman's worn out at some point in her life. Blue Star. Is it like the female version of Dzhokhar? Yeah, but it's in this star and it's not like one of those bottles that stand up. It's like the most retarded shaped bottle ever. Anyways, I went to go grab something off the shelf in my bathroom and I didn't even know it was there. I fell down and broke in my bathroom. My fucking house smells like my grandmother times a thousand.

Speaker 1:          02:23:52       It's awful. It's don't go away. It's so gay. It's horrible. All perfumes. Creepy. Yeah. Passion of mine. Like mine. It's my MMA. I love perfume and smells and lotions. Real loud. Girls are so strange. I think smells. I smelled good and at all times. That's a Texas thing too though. Texas women know how to be women. You know how to girly? Yeah. They know how to grill it up. You know? It's not like Wyoming. Women take a hit on women in Wyoming. A few in Wyoming does a few coyotes, mountain lions and shit. There's mountain lions and shit. But the grapefruit I think is a, not an aphrodisiac, but men are attracted. This melon grapefruit. Really Vanilla too. But grapefruits, the one that does it but just doesn't have great for dinner. Do you like perfume when girls wear a perfume? Brian? Yeah, but there's a certain kind of, yeah, so that's good.

Speaker 1:          02:24:44       I don't like the perfume. The perfume. Me, you know, like the kinds of perfume right now. I like don't you are a hair perfume and then I have a project. It's like my own thing and I do it. Even if I'm going to be by myself all day. Whoa. It's smell right here. Don't be shy. Don't be weird. That's good. That's very mellow. It's not flowery. Smells like food. Okay, so you're a true kind of sore. You know what you'd be doing very seriously. So when you smell a stinky girl, that's like over perfume and is that offensive to, you know, I just don't want to be here. You don't want to be here. You feel bad for her. Cause everybody's body chemistry works with different smells. Like it just depends on who you are. Some that you could love the way it smells in the bottle and then on you, it either doesn't last or smells bad.

Speaker 1:          02:25:26       And so it just depends. Only thing I ever do is I put on deodorant so other people don't get offended. You should get your photo. Timberlake's Timberlake's is exit pretty good? No. What does that Justin Timberlake, Timberlake, Cologne. I'm not wearing, just missed it. I split some shit and land or armed. And then chocolate one, the chocolate one. I went to college with this kid who was repugnant by every definition and he was an awful person and he was fat and he was gross and he sweat a lot. But when he, when he's wondering why he would come and we'd have these meetings for this conduct your Bros and when he would come into meetings and I hated this kid, I would find myself scooting closer because he would wear acts. Whoa. They have one that's called chocolate paradise I think. Recommended. I think you're a freak about this.

Speaker 1:          02:26:09       Like good smells. I think you're afraid. Amazing sense of smell on it. That's it. It's very rare. I don't think I understand what you're saying, but I don't think dude should a plan for someone like, you know, I think it's a very rare attraction to smells. You have very rare. Do you get super fan and when dudes fart like a friend or like a boy, then my boyfriend, like a boy that you like. Every boyfriend I've had has not done it in front of me cause he knows about your smelter. Super courteous about it. I'm not even sure. Like the last one we dated for a year. He'd always leave. Never hotbox to, no, no one would ever do that to me that I was serious. The kind of guy that would do Brian, you're off the list. Brian's a hotbox or from the 80s he was hot boxing back before I even had a name back when it was an oven. Actually I have a bit about that whole office.

Speaker 4:          02:26:56       Ford is when every time I get in a relationship, like this last girl I dated from Texas, from Houston, we had like a really a good relationship and then she started doing these little things that made it not romantic and more. One of the things to steer asleep blew a fart on me and goes, do you want breakfast in bed? And she goes, there's your eggs bitch. And she blew a fart on me. And I'm like, really? Did have that really did happen. Yeah, I did that in my ag. That's, and that's true. And then that just kills a relationship. Girls don't ever look at it. Almost throwing up

Speaker 1:          02:27:24       part. I'd done that like for sure. I'm foreign it on accident and then it's like I'm saying like there's things that happen, but to deliberately suffocate someone. Right. That's gross. She how rude. How rude. Houston girls, man, they're there. Hillbilly. He'll be part of my state. You can find some good ones. Good ones everywhere fellow. You just attract a certain type. I did it. I got to do something about that. You got to do something about that. Toby. Blaming Texas. Well, lobby blaming Houston for years has been Texas. You could figure it out, bro. You can get better. It's over. Do you do that to your wife? No. No Way. You guys who don't Fart in front of each other. I mean accidentally. Yeah. You wouldn't be like, Hey, come here. No, no. I don't know when he wants a smaller farts. Farts are horrible. There's no need for that. I eat too much. Me are okay by the way. Someone's far. It's in my little daughter far. It's aren't that you like your own parts. Doesn't eat much. She's a little girl. She needs a lot. You'd be amazed. Her logs, she drops logs a little or the dog shit in the potty. I see these logs. I'm like, there's no way. And now she

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       calls it logs. I told you cause it's your daughter, but they're huge logs. If you didn't know her, you'd be like, that's awful. If I didn't know. Yeah, yeah, of course I have to pick this. The thing is that the parties are ridiculous because what it is is a little plastic bucket on the bottom. That's that your baby shits in. So you have this like advanced civilization where people have toilets and running water, but you don't use it for little babies. They have to shift it a little box because you have to be what you were with them all the time anyway. So it's just a minor inconvenience. You just dump it in the toilet and all that. But, but it's, they can't climb up to the hook the toilet, yet. They're not really designed for that yet and they can't hold themselves up or they're falling.

Speaker 3:          02:28:55       Right. So I get her, she's got like a little thing that sits on top of the toilet. But then again, you've got to pick her up. But she drops these logs to like human sized. I mean, if it was my poop, it would be as big as my chest. I mean, it doesn't even make any sense that there's so much shit comes out of her little body. No, you gotta take the famous photo of her pooping. Now you see the baby. That's a good one for you.
