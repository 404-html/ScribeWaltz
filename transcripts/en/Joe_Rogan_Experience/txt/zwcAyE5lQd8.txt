Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Yes. What's up sturgeon? Mother Falcons in. Dude, you've been on a ride. So last time I talked to you, when was the last time I talked to you? Wasn't that long ago? No, last time you'd been here here. Things kind of just something wonky. It was boomi almost a really good show. I'm wrong with that. Somehow with the headphones might be just me. Might fucking weed. Well you ever. Yeah that sounds better. Thank you. Which Jamie some fucking effects on that bitch. He didn't touch anything. He was just asking because if February. So um, uh, yeah, I mean you're blowing the fuck up dude. I have to get this out of the way before we even start talking. Got It. It's fascinating to watch was a because well it's always fascinating to watch someone who you think is very talented. Get recognized and I thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       Very talented. So then, and then becoming friends with you, it's interesting to talk to you and to see what it's like. See me process it all the time. Probably have some interesting insight I would imagine. Yeah, I guess so. For me, it was a slow, one was a slow burn, took a long time and a lot of different shows till it started getting really weird. It was pretty manageable news radio. Was that. How long were you out here before that happened? I came out here for a show right before that I was on another show called hardball. There's this baseball show, so that was like, uh, maybe like six months before news radio, so it wasn't very long. I came out here specifically for that hardball show. One of the things just sort of opportunities turned into other things, you know, the ebbs and flows and comes and goes.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       But uh, the news radio fame was nonexistent. Like nobody ever recognized me. Everyone. But you're getting recognized now. Not Too much man in specific towns where we do better. Yeah. But it's mostly, you know, 99 percent of the time. People were really cool. Yeah. Isn't that the fact? Yeah, that's really what's up. Ninety nine percent of the time. People really good. Even the one percent are still cool. It's just lasts a little too long. I don't know. It's the outliers. Know the extreme cases that aren't, you know, the one percent of the one percent that could be a sign in that in the grand scheme of things, I don't feel like I've really blown up that big, you know what I mean? Like it's, I feel like I've clawed my way to the beginning as it were. That's a good way to look at it. But it's some. Well, I mean, what's the beginning? What's the, what's the, what's the top? I don't. I don't know exactly what I do know is that there's a lot of people that like will text me. Dude, have you heard a surgical simpson? Holy Shit now man. It's A. Although

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       I guess transitionally has been in the last couple of years, three years, but I've been doing this my whole life, um, to various levels of thanklessness. But yeah, a lot of years in Honky tonks and just dive bars where you were background noise. So I am, now that I'm older, I think that's been the best part of it is I'm, I'm clear and focused enough and have enough responsibilities in my life to where I'm not taking it for granted. Does it make sense 100 percent trying to like really use it as the opportunity that is to do something hopefully bigger than just myself. So.

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       Well being a famous singer, you know, you, you affect people and a singer and a songwriter, you affect people in a very strange way. You know, the, there's like a, an intense emotion that's um, that's connected to a song that really moves you, you know, there's this intense connection. And so, um, it's, I think for someone like you, like it's great that you've got all this life experience. I think that helps so much, man. I think if you're a fucking Justin Bieber type character, boy, you're almost guaranteed to be fucked. Like that kind of scrutiny. I don't. How old was he when that all started? Baby Panda, who he is, but I couldn't tell you a single song, but yet I know who he is. Why is that? Well, he's famous as famous as fuck, but yeah, the poor guy. I mean. Well, yeah, the poor guy.

Speaker 1:          00:04:30       Nobody could nobody. It's easy to judge and sit back and be like, oh, you're such a fuck up. Like the kid has a very rare and unique perspective on the life experience. That kid is doing a splendid job. A splendid. He's fucking up just enough fucking up a little bit, but you know, he's fine in comparison to what a normal person would be with that kind of insane breach like that. It was just what, what it must be like for him to just try to go through a group of girls. He just, he gets attack like dogs. They will fight for him. The claw at him.

Speaker 1:          00:05:12       What the fuck man. That he's only like 19 or something. Right. And is he 19? That's insane. That's insane. It's got to be so hard to, to keep your shit together and to have a balanced perspective because there's only perspective is one of fame. So you talking about the Honky tonks and you know, when you hear last time you talked about crazy jobs you had, like you worked on a train, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean think about that kind of shit. Go from that, that kind of shit to where you are now. You have an earned perspective, an earned perspective. Whereas it's still hard to feel like it. When you say earned.

Speaker 2:          00:05:47       My life's pretty, pretty cool now, man. Like I get to go out and make art for a living and support my family and, and play music.

Speaker 1:          00:05:55       Yeah. No, it's awesome. It's kind of dope for sure. It even even that said, as long as it took to get here and even the last three years we toured our asses off me like going in circles to kind of build it organically, you know, uh, feel really proud about that because all I, no matter what happens up or down, like, and I can feel like I accomplished something with merit, but it

Speaker 1:          00:06:21       was, it beautiful time. It's a beautiful time for artists, you know? So we're definitely in a moment. Yeah, right. For sure. It seems like a moment with music, a moment with. It's definitely a moment with stand up comedy. We all talk about it. It's like the best time ever for standup I think contribute. I'm still getting over. Brian Holtzman, who was the guy that did the last set that do that fucking. I was traumatized. I was an experienced man. I can't even tell you because you got motherfuckers didn't tell me what was coming to sit. I'm sitting here thinking like I'm watching this guy bomb harder than anything I've ever seen. Like telling people in the audience to just start fucking. And he's like truck couldn't take my eyes off of it. It's amazing. It was awesome. And then after the study is like, yeah, you know, like, Holy Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:07:09       That was all just geodis yeah, he's genius. Brian holzman's genius 100 percent. And he keeps running out of the room man. Like literally this takes two were together, ran out of the room to get away from this thing happening. The vial expression of toxic masculinity on stage. Yeah. Brian does the kinison spot, which is the last spot of the night. So the last guy on the comedy store, most pops the comments? Yeah. Last Pot at the comedy store. It just goes on from like, I guess he gets on probably somewhere around 1230, maybe one inch and then he'll, he might go til to. So he's got a long stretch. He does whatever he wants. That's why it's the innocence. How long has he been in this? But while he's the perfect guy for that spot and he does it on and off. He's been there at the store as long as I have.

Speaker 1:          00:08:00       He's been there at the store since [inaudible] 94. I was, I met him in [inaudible] 94. Was it always in that room? Now? He does the little room to. That's where I first met him or first met him. He was like this promising up and coming guy that would go on in the smaller room and um, you know, he was like one of the hot up and coming guys. But he always kept like a real job. But he's, in my opinion, he's one of the best comics in the world. He just doesn't get a chance to show it to people. We've tried to talk about like what would be the best way to let people know and I think because he changes his stuff so much. I think just putting cameras on him every night filming these Kennison spots that he does every Friday and Saturday night. I tell everybody if you want to see some comments to tough one because to, to make people aware, you know, to let them know you kind of have to almost in a way sort of have to give away what makes it, what it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:52       I don't know man. It doesn't bother me. I know, I know and I think it's fucking genius. I know he's a great guy and it's. But I mean we're, we're, we're kind of beating around the Bush here. He says obviously ridiculously offensive thing, but he doesn't really mean I fucking have always loved that style of comedy, you know? And he's in my opinion and like one of the best ever at it. He's a monster. Just people don't know for whatever, but they don't know because he never left. He stayed at the store and that's a spot he stayed in la and he always kept a job. He always had a job. He's a meter, a meter maid at one point. Had a bunch of jobs like that kind of will be Koski type guy. Exactly. But you know, you, you got to do it all for them.

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       Like someone's got to come along and do it all for them better. Oh really? Yeah. It was just like, all right, let's be casual, bro Kissed. But uh, yeah, I'm in the studio either man really bug you. They fuck with me. It's just not, it's not a natural, uh, you're, you're responding to what you're hearing. You're close to the, you know, it's good for some people because some people don't realize how goofy it sounds when everybody talks over everybody. I'll give you a three people and they don't have the ear things while you were talking about before you. Yeah. So the fight podcasts we do for people and we made it mandatory like got to wear earphones because we were drunk and stoned and we're talking over each other. People with chewing into the mic, you know, how bad it sounds, people eating pickles, potato chips and pickles into the fucking microphone and it's just like, oh my God, I would get these screaming texts from people, stopped chewing into the fucking microphones. So we had to, we had to institute the headphones policy, but for a gentle conversational, it's like yourself. It's very easy to put those aside.

Speaker 1:          00:10:48       Are you, um, like when you were touring like all those three years when you were going crazy and, and torn like a maniac, have you settled that down to more manageable sort of a schedule?

Speaker 2:          00:11:00       Yeah, it, it would have been fine otherwise. I mean I've always lived out of a bag really, you know what I mean? And, and wanted to be moving all the time. So like in that regard is kind of ideal, but it just, the timing was a little bittersweet. Right. My son was born about a month after the last record came out of a, um, it was home for that. And then basically three, three or four days after he was born, I had to go to Europe for some shows. And then press started rolling in a word of mouth and record, just started selling to, it's like a movie and my weight and my wife has a very supportive in our that I wouldn't have moved to national first place to do anything without her, like telling me you can do this, you know what I mean? I'd probably still be working for the railroad.

Speaker 2:          00:11:48       So, uh, when, when it all kind of came about, you know, just basically said, you know, we didn't, we didn't come here and like you do everything up until this point to not be able to go and because you have to, now you have to tour, right? Um, so, uh, did in other, you know, I think missing out what was going on at home and, and carrying some sense of guilt maybe for that, because even though like in my hair and my dreams are coming true, it's providing for my family, but when we come home after five or six weeks and then I've got a week at home before leaving again, I'm just kind of see. I was seeing what I was missing and incremental stages, you know, and I think it took a toll on me emotionally in a way that I wouldn't have anticipated. So that's kind of where this record came from.

Speaker 3:          00:12:32       I don't go on that kind of tour, but when I go away just for a few days, just for four or five days. Yeah, it bums me out when you come back home, this rush of love, you know, it's a good way to put it. It's what it's like. It's like this new when I come home, like I just got back from the road. I was in Boston this weekend. I come home on Sunday and when your kids run up to you and jump into your arms and you're carrying them and talking to them, you know, it's like, it's very hard to describe for anybody that doesn't have any children or doesn't have close friends with children. It's very hard to describe. It's a fucking game changer. Game Changer. It changes who you are instantly. Yeah. You just different thing. You're a different perspective on the world is so different and I don't think it's mandatory.

Speaker 3:          00:13:24       I think this is important to say because man, I used to bum me the fuck out when people who were fathers or mothers would treat you like you were doing something wrong because you didn't have kids. There was something wrong with you or they would tell you that you don't even know about life until you have kids or that you know. Yeah, it's a perspective enhancer, but guess what? A lot of Shit's a purpose. Perspective. Enhanced or like you don't have to do it, but for me, because I just hate when people tell people you know, that it's like this mandatory aspect of life. I think you could absolutely have a fulfilled life and never procreate. People shouldn't be appearance, man. Yeah, for sure. Almost every girl I ever dated stay out of the business.

Speaker 3:          00:14:10       That's not true. They changed to man. I have a buddy of mine. His ex girlfriend was crazy just off the charts crazy. Just wild girls out of her mind, drugs and sex and chaos. She had a kid. Bam. Snapped out of it, eats healthy, organic. She's super mom who wasn't about her anymore. It also is about a fresh chance to do something correct and raise a child would love and and not create someone like yourself. It's a, it's this weird eyeopening thing. I think for a lot of people when they realize we're all, their anger comes from where all the oil comes from not being raised correctly. That's a giant part of most people's lives

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       is what kind of an interaction you have with the people that love you and if you get programmed like real early on, that love means hitting and screaming and chaos and yelling and fighting to. By the time when I was a kid, man, I used to look about marriage, like somebody wanted a serve me plates of shit for the rest of my life. Like what? Like why would you do it? Because what I grew up with was just chaos. I grew up with people yelling at each other and hitting each other and ah, fuck this. And you don't realize. I think until you have a little baby that you're watching, learn and develop and you sort of data crunching all this shit, all these events in this child's life and you're experiencing all this with them and we're experiencing with them as this intense bond of, of, of love, but have also have guidance so you have to guide this little person and so while I'm doing that and just little moments and events in my daughters' lives, little conversations that we have that make me sort of process how they view the world and how they think about things that has made me just so much more aware of where a lot of my own

Speaker 2:          00:16:00       weird personality quirks have come from. It's like looking into your own eyes so you're seeing, you know, everything is instantly recognizable. It's a. But yeah, that's a good one. How would you say, you said the seeing their perspective, but they're just mirroring whatever you're doing it because they don't hide things.

Speaker 4:          00:16:21       Yeah. They don't hide emotions. They don't hide thoughts and if you can open up lines of communication with them really young and get them constantly used to talking about feelings and about thoughts and about why do you get those feelings? Like what, you know, they'll get jealous of each other. Why does she get a new and why do you care? She has a new tour. Like why does that bother you if somebody else has something good and you see the little brain going, oh yeah, because this is like animal fucking instinct that makes you want to get upset about something and you're like, what? Her friend gave her a tour. Where's my shit? You know? And you gotta like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. You were happy until you found out that something good happened to someone you love. That doesn't make any sense. Now does it be like, oh yeah, you could see the little fucking tiny, tiny brain spinning on her

Speaker 2:          00:17:07       just starting to talk. So we'll get there. But now it's like trip. We really like playing drums together. That's awesome. When he's talking to you, is it freak you out? It's happening right now. Gosh, it was there for awhile, there was this little period was like 10 words every day and you don't even know they're picking them up until they say them and they'll look, you know, look at something and say it and you know, you haven't had this lesson yet. And it's like, wow, man, for someone to express emotions and, and uh, or even to see them at such a young age and understanding how to manipulate situations. That's really interesting. Social dynamic. You're worried

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       like a primitive game of chess. A little primitive child. Chess, my daughter was three and we were skiing and she was packing her stuff up and uh, she didn't have her helmet or suitcase, so she had her suitcase closed and then my wife goes, hey, you forgot your pr, your helmet. And she goes, Shit. She was three when a three year old goes shit, like a nice long one. Just how to say it. I had a bite my hand to keep from laughing. I mean, I try to encourage like stuff that's funny as much as possible, but he can encourage him swearing because they don't, they don't have the self control to like shut it off and they go to school. You don't want to be the parents. They teach the kids. It's where on that, but it is fine. It really is the fuck are we doing is restricting the use of words to children. Let's about over to the PC thing. Oh my God. It's driving me fucking bananas. But this one is just fucking crazy. So it just so crazy. Why swears

Speaker 1:          00:19:02       just seemed so strange. Like doesn't seem to be an issue most anywhere else in the world. You Go. Well, for adults in business, I kind of understand that using them formalities for formalities mean if you want to know it is a lazy form of linguistics though mean. Sure if you're just. But Hey, it feels good so. Well it can be lazy, but it's like everything else. I think it's stress related, honestly. Man swearing. I think it really. I think it comes from anxieties and stress induced a variable variables. I remember like in the navy, it's fuck this, fuck that, fuck every other word, and when I worked at the railroad was salty language out there image because you're under this like highly efficient expectation all the time and there's all these creative personalities and ideas bouncing off each other. He's a little confined spaces and everybody's just wound tighter advantage of the string.

Speaker 1:          00:19:53       It could be used. Again, gay always though, right? It can also use as like a pause. Sometimes people use use it in place of a meter tool. Well, you know, sometimes people don't know what they're gonna say next and they say, ah, but instead they're replacing with fuck like fucking fucking guy with his fucking. I'm fucking sitting there, right? I'm fucking talking to us, you know, like that kind of. That's where it gets real lazy. That's what most people don't even realize. Like the weird ticks they have. I didn't realize how many times I'd say, you know, or you know what I mean. Or, or like the word like, like isn't fucking dangerous one because you could be talking to someone and not pick it up. But then once you do pick it up, you, it's all here, it's all you hear like people have that little and we're roadblock and they have a blind side. They didn't see it a blind spot and they just say like

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       all the time. It's terrifying because it might be me. I definitely have been. Tommy has got a bad score. Has got it bad. He's got it bad. He's a like a hawk. He loves the hymns it up a little bit. But like in that video he did in Cleveland this weekend. Did you see that? I didn't see that. That's really funny. Was it him in Hannibal burress? No, no, no. He was on a news. Was playing that character. Yeah. I did see that.

Speaker 2:          00:21:17       Our friend Thompson girl was in this morning show. He ever do those. Do you have to do those morning shows? I don't do. My career will suffer to some degree with cause of it, but man, I just, I would, I would never ask anyone to deal with me in a situation like that. So it's best just to know what you are.

Speaker 3:          00:21:36       Yeah. And accepted. Do you get a hard time for not wanting to do like certain kinds of press? Do they give you a hard time?

Speaker 2:          00:21:43       Not really. I mean, I think most of the people who have been working with for awhile now, they know who they're dealing with. Um, and I, I don't, I don't mind doing the press honestly. It's just, it's a, at a certain point it becomes I think counterproductive or even destructive because it's, you don't know, you just repeating things a lot to the point that you're asked the same question so many times that without even realizing you find yourself giving verbatim answers. Whereas when you know it's time to stop talking about it because it's a like, like I said, the more I feel like I talk about it, you sort of denying people their a better chance to interpret in a way that's going to make it mean even more to them in the hero in a way that maybe I didn't even mean it. Does the, your memories become weird to you and talk about them all the time too.

Speaker 2:          00:22:38       When you talk about certain things and you repeat yourself over and over again, it does. It almost becomes a script to you, like the memories get weird. I realized, you know, like I said, I've been playing music forever, but all this other stuff was very sudden transition, but being a skeptical, naturally skeptical person and self aware like you get in these situations and I sort of realized there's a certain theatrical to it all, you know what I mean, and and then once you get past the reality of that and then you, you learn enough about it to know that you can sit and talk for three hours literally, but it's not a representation of what you talked about. You can talk about everything under the sun and they might take one little sentence that had nothing to do with anything and an editor decides that that should be the title of the article that has now written from some preconceived stance that you did. You were unaware of during the conversation. You know what I mean? It's like word is especially problematic. Print context

Speaker 3:          00:23:36       can't print context and it's literally someone's interpretation. It's art. That's interpreting an individual, so if someone writes a story about you, it's really art because it's their own way of flavoring. This whole interaction they try to do with colorful descriptives and they try to use bold adjectives and try to figure out a way to paint it in the most entertaining way as well as get some point across. So I think sometimes a lot of guys are also just trying to get you to click on their website. Yep. That true. But the way to do that is with a good entertainment. So it doesn't necessarily have to be an actual factual representation of who you are. Like if someone writes a story about you, like what's almost more important is this art of getting something salacious is art of writing something, something that makes you say, oh, this guy's wild or this guy's, you know, it has to be like this one thing. Sturgill Simpson first fucked up man when he was 14, you know, you know what I mean? Like something like first sentence, like, Hey Jesus, what the fuck is this article going? You know, not really, but he would have you believe that you know, and the enemy like it starts.

Speaker 2:          00:24:46       I, I, I didn't realize it until it's, when you meet people on the street and you realize they have these crazy, misinformed ideas about who you are and what you represent and like what you are. I mean, you know those, those, a good lesson learned. Yeah. That's a good lesson for anybody. She would just kind of a dork. And what's that? It's really just like a dork and you, but you're like, this is outlaw tough guy. Like, you know, fucking dirt. The dirt. That's what they think. I don't know. Some of them, some of them probably do. We're always looking for that though, right? I think for the outlaw country guy seems to be the case.

Speaker 3:          00:25:27       Yeah. Like that was the shooter had a song making fun of all these, like fake outlaws. They have all that shit to his dad did well. His Dad was the real thing. You know, it's got to be hard to look at some fake outlaws with designer scratches in their genes. Like they got attacked by a fucking leopard or some shit. I mean, that looks so stupid. And when your dad is fucking waylon jennings, that's got to be even more offensive. Okay. Imagine man, you know, and they see these guys with a hat that they just got 15 minutes for. They went on stage, someone handed so placed it perfectly and someone's doing their hair and checking in and making sure everything's good. Then they send them out there to be an outlaw sober on adderall. Probably Beta blockers.

Speaker 2:          00:26:17       It's something that I couldn't, I couldn't possibly describe to you how little I pay attention to it. Yeah. To cut to a country or to music in general country. But even anymore I don't really listen to module one on

Speaker 3:          00:26:34       you. Are you buddies with that Guy Jason? Who is bill? Yeah, that's the right way to say it dude. I just got into him a couple of weeks ago. Genius. Fantastic. I listened to

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       that. Uh, his most recent album, like the entire time I was in Mexico, I was in Mexico for like a week or just list him the entire time. Yeah. We use a jason please. Some shows together. Good dude man. Good, good. You should have him on a podcast. I would love to. Interesting. Seems a smart dude. Great writer. Oh yeah, he's Kinda the guy. Yeah. Oh my God. I mean the lyrics credible, intense. Just so really well structured too. That's the other thing about this job is, you know, you meet people that you hit it off with but you never hang out because you're never at home. So we've was trying for like two years to take our wives. It's one of the other. You either on tour or somebody back or. I know exactly what it's like. I know exactly what it's like a comedian's. We worked together a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:27:30       That's how we do it. We also worked together at the store. That's why the store is like a great base. It's like home base, so everybody goes to the store so we meet each other in the store during the weeknights and then a lot of times on the weekends we'll work together. So like if we do big theater shows, especially you think you're down there, the store, I'm at least to always at least two. Just working. Yeah, it depends on how many nights I'm in town, you know, but it's, it's convenient for me because my spots are always after 10 so my kids are already asleep so I can, I can jet out after I put them to bed, I can get, you know, they go to bed at like eight. So I'm gone. You know, it's perfect. And it's also like for, for anybody who does the road a lot, it's a nice wake up call, you know, like you just see these animals going up in there.

Speaker 1:          00:28:18       You know Chris rock show up working on his Oscars. He showed up that Saturday night. We. That's right. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Chappelle shows up all the time. Louis shows up all the time. Bill burrs there all the time. I mean just all the assessment up and testing out new stuff or are keeping their chops up, chat, testing out new stuff. All the above. Just working, you know, it's like they're at everyone's act as sort of like a work of progress, you know, and when you're close to them and you watch it from, they'd be like, like Joey Diaz who I think is the funniest guy of all time. He's the funniest guy ever. Never, never laughed harder than watching him. But I watch his bits, uh, watch them develop like a because I'm working with them all the time. That's some of the more interesting things about.

Speaker 1:          00:29:00       One of the more interesting things about being friends with a lot of comedians is watching all the different styles of creation, how they do it, how they piece it together. It's just like songwriting. There's like, there's no right way to do it. Yeah Man, I tell you what, just to, I've only, you know, I'm just now getting to spend any time out here. Uh, but there's something about that world just a couple of times I've gone and I've spent time in that place. It's a totally different head space than anything I'm used to or accustomed to. And you can see there's definitely a sense of community. Oh yeah, there was a, a palatable underlying darkness. Oh yeah. To at all. But I think what I liked the most about it is there's no area,

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       you know, for all in all, everybody seems to be pretty black and white and like real as fuck, you know, you can get away with some ridiculous shit on that stage two because it's just the way it's always been like, like holtzman without giving any of his set away. Some of the things that he was saying, are you like Jesus fucking Christ? Oh Dude, I was. I mean I know you're enjoying that because also they're just like, oh shit. He was particularly on fire that night too, like the screaming at people and so what happens when somebody gets up and just jumps on the stage and goes for him? Because it happened before his girlfriend. I was just like, what is happening? Holy Shit. That was intense. But the people were laughing, but people have attacked him. Really? Yeah. Martin Lawrence, his bodyguard. Ego Self. I mean I wasn't there.

Speaker 3:          00:30:35       I missed the festivities, but from what I understand, Martin Lawrence was in the audience and him and Holtzman like we're going back and forth and Holtzman went over to the table to point out that it was actually Martin Lawrence that he was, there was, he was being heckled by Martins bodyguard, gets up, punched him in the head and knocked him out. That was one time I heard, but there was some other stuff too. Damn. One time he took a fucking an ashtray. And Ari was talking about this the other day. The comedy store, um, especially like in the early days had these thick fucking glass ashtrays, old school school for Ashtrays. I'm sure many people got murdered with one of those fucking things. Holtzman was talking about Charlie's angels and how angry he was that anybody really believes how a woman could kick all those meds. I take already grabs that ashtray. Oh, fucking crusher had he throws the Astraea at the table and shatters his fucking ass. Trey. Holy Fuck. Yeah. It's like, whoa. He blew an ash tray up in the room. I mean, glass flying all over the fucking place. I mean, he really, through this ashtray down on this table and shattered it. It was a small crowd, but someone easily could've got hit with a honker glass that probably that class probably still on that ground.

Speaker 3:          00:31:59       He definitely could probably find the sharp dude, but he's going for it. You know what I mean? It's, it's, it's one of those things we were talking about, like there's, there's a. When you're writing a song, I guess it's probably similar to where you are creating this narrative. You, you're, you're, you're being a separate person maybe than you are in real life and you're creating it and you're, you're seeing it from that person's perspective. But when a guy like holtzman is doing that on stage, he's doing something similar, but because it's just talking, people don't accept it as not his

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       opinion. You know, they, they think that he's just a fucking asshole and a misogynist and the this and the that. And it's not just like he's a character in a movie that's playing and asshole. That's happened to be hilarious. Which we accept with no reservation too weird, right? It's A.

Speaker 1:          00:33:01       I don't know. I was just sitting there, we're really after the fact and then looking back on what I just seen how when he's in the moment of playing the frustrated, you know, like you have such, you know, like what's the fucking, what's the point? And I was like, but it's so he was just so in that it has to make me feel like a part big part of. It's coming from a real place to, you know. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. It's just. I mean he's not carrying that around with them all the time, but that's definitely coming from a real place. He has been about Hillary. I can't give it away in a way. Yeah, for sure. Definitely. But he's like, he's a very smart guy. Obviously he's legitimately frustrated at the world around him. You know who isn't, but if you're not, then you're not paying attention.

Speaker 1:          00:33:46       It's that simple. In this day and age, look you. What we all should try to do, and I know you agree, is try to be as harmonious as you can in your life, in your personal life and your friendships harmonious as he can. The problem today is that in this day and age, we have access to all the stories, all the stores everywhere. There's too many of us. That's too much data to crunch. You're only going to get the shitty ones because it's shitty ones. The ones that going to hear about because those are the ones, you know, Isis cuts baby's head off. Holy Shit. The babies scare me, man. Don't worry about isis and things like that. Worry more about natural disasters will weirdest, weirdest to say that whatever we talk, when I get hung up on fault lines and uh, you know, the inevitable, but my wife makes fun of me about it. But no, I mean, I guess a shouldn't be worried about isis. But um, um, I mean hell, these Neo Nazi

Speaker 5:          00:34:45       been

Speaker 1:          00:34:46       perspective Zionist group scare me more than Isis. You know, like people like the homegrown ones. This ones actually here in our country that the Oregon guys a high I don't want. Well I don't, man. I watched about two minutes of that and was just like, I can't even look at this. We still never found out who called them. Y'All Qaeda, we believe someone on the show named them yell, Kil Kinda. It was either that or was it a comic that we named them? I saw it a lot of times on Google, so I don't know where it started, but might not have even started there. Then the person who said it might've heard it first. Either way, what a fucking great name. Y'All Qaeda. I fuckin love that name. How did, what did, what did. I mean? I honestly did step away, wouldn't end up happening with all the um, one guy got shot and killed and then there was uh, some guys turned themselves in and uh, you know, there was a standoff for a long period of time had do with grazing

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       and cattle cattle on, on public land. We call it department of land management. Dlm is a dlm land. Is that it? Bureau land management. Blm, Blm, that's it. There's a mountain range and he taught it would still be on Blm land and a lot of the hunters for literally 100, 100 year ban on is the Okra, I think Okra, mountain range and valley. And they were getting ready to open it back up after a hundred years. So they say, well, most people don't have this and their country. Most countries don't have a giant swaths of public land that you can hunt and fish on. Right. That was all because of Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt faced so much pressure to not to not do that and to give in to that, that he wound up leaving. Was he a Republican or Democrat? I feel like the Democrats used to be the more conservative ones back in the day and then the Republicans were the more open minded and liberal.

Speaker 3:          00:36:36       Then somewhere along the line, the polar axis is shifted. That's what I've written. Read Rather. Anyway, Teddy Roosevelt, he deemed all of this land all over the country as public land. And you, you could never do anything with it. You can't. You can't fucking put cities in it. You can't do shit with it. This is just public land and this is land owned by the people of the United States. And there's been a lot of like really shady politicians that have looked at our debt because the United States has massive debt and they'd said, look, this is one way we can get rid of this debt. We can sell some of our public land. I think Paul Ryan, that guy that's one of the presidential guys, think he bowed out of the presidential election, but he was one of the guys that was. It was one of his proposals and people, the outdoors people, people that hike and hunt and fish.

Speaker 3:          00:37:31       They were going fucking crazy. Like you can't do this like you can't. But. But you look at it on CNN, it's like one of the most important things about what makes this country amazing is some of our natural resources, our parks. Nothing else like it on the planet to Yosemite. I mean, cody, go to Yosemite if you don't think there's, there's some majesty in places in the world, like almost like a magic land. You look at those mountains and you see a grizzly bear and you see a herd of Bison. You're like, Holy Shit, like this. What is this? This is a wild park. You can go through this park and you might get eaten by a grizzly. Go ahead. Good luck. I mean, you're in the world where people are fucking coddled and pampered and every edge is covered by a thick chunk of nerf. Shit gets real. Dude. You could walk to yellowstone, to people over the last like five years had been killed by bears. It happens more than you think. Yeah, man. My friend was there. He heard wolves howl. He said it was the craziest shit. He said, we're in Yosemite near here.

Speaker 6:          00:38:30       You hear it.

Speaker 3:          00:38:33       I was like, is it like a coyotes game? Know

Speaker 4:          00:38:35       it's a fucking wolf man. It's different.

Speaker 2:          00:38:39       Bad, bad, bad. Way To go to Roosevelt and yellowstone. Have you ever been to the ranger station that. I think he's the one that had it built out there, but it's this like 20 story, high cabin. There was all these weird. Wouldn't you can go to them? I've heard of it, but I never been amazing. Just a really old, really old to me over 100 years old with all the forest rangers. I think. I hope I'm getting that right, lived in it, but it's pretty much like the coolest treehouse you'll ever see anywhere on the planet. What is big hunting lodge? Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:39:11       Check it out. If you're out there, imagine those days man, when they. They only, you know, like we have a pretty clear view from all the data we've taken in all the photographs and video and all the peoples accounts. We have a clear view of what this country's like. You know, at this point. Yeah. We know. We know about the drive to Vegas from La. We know about going up the coast to Sam. You know what I'm saying? We don't. But in the Teddy Roosevelt days stay where they were still like 50 years into picture. Undaunted courage. Their first pictures were in the late 18 hundreds. Right. So the Teddy Roosevelt age. I mean this motherfucker was, they barely knew anything. No the fuck. Did they. How? What year was Roosevelt President? Early 19 hundreds. Nine. So think about that. They'd only had pictures for like what, 50 or 60 years.

Speaker 4:          00:40:06       How many pictures of their, of their, of yellowstone or of the Colorado rockies are all the different types of wildlife you're going to run into about a wolverine. You got a photo of a wolverine, yet I just stumbled across that fucking thing for the first time going, Jesus, what is that? Fuck, man. I was watching this video the other day with this dude who was driving his fucking car. He watched a wolf and a c and a mountain lion fighting to the death there would duke it out right in front of him and he stopped his car and he said they were so close that he could reach out and touch the wolf. And so he's sitting there in his car while there's wolf and this mount line or fucking engaged in mortal combat. I'm cool, I'm good. Whatever, but what a crazy trip that would be to see that. And you know, if you were in the teddy rose,

Speaker 2:          00:41:02       if I knew they weren't coming through the windshield. Yeah, go see that. But I mean I'm getting out of the car. I don't know. Yeah, we drove through yellowstone every time. It never fails if there is a grizzly citing. Yeah, you get there and there's like 20 carloads of people standing out on the street with their cameras out and arranger standards saying, please get back in your car. You're, you know, you're entering the food chain. The guy was so sardonic about it. It was just like, this is amazing. This is it right here. This is the video. This is the wolf

Speaker 4:          00:41:28       and the, the mountain lions. The wolf by the neck. Wow. The mountain lion jacked him. That is

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       crazy. Look at the mountain lion winning. I think I'd rather get eaten by a great white shark and taken out by a cougar man because it's going to play with you like a ball of yarn. Back it up, Jamie, because before that you actually see them. Duke it out before the mountain lion wins. My uh, a friend of mine is a guide. He's a hunting guide in Colorado. Look at this battle that mountain lion just clamps down on his neck at Wolf's trying, but it ain't working out. Dude. The amount line and letting go. Fuck. Did you say that video of the panther, the lady caught on video running panther brand by brand by her? Yeah. That's in Florida.

Speaker 2:          00:42:15       Was hiking on antelope island one time and uh, just north of Utah and they have this big buffalo reserve out there. It's like a public peak probably six out. No, they height in a. But there's all these free range in buffalo were on the island, you know, it's coming back down the hill. Me and my buddy and as we were hiking down a trail, you know, about 300 yards down, I can see there's a couple of buffalo right on, right on the trail, on the footpath. And we're like, that's right. They'll, they'll be moved on by the time we get there. And when we come down the hill, come around this big boulder and sure shit, they're still standing there. And I, you know, my uncle had a farm. He had cows. I never been around a damn buffalo. I don't know the difference in suddenly, well they'll move.

Speaker 2:          00:42:56       It's just a big ass cow, you know, so we just keep walking towards him buddy. He jumps up on a rock and he's just laughing at me like a dumb ass because I'm standing there at this point, this thing is 15 feet in front of God and it was grazing like sideways was his hip towards me and he's just eaten. And finally he looks up and turns his head and looked at me, man. And I realized, Holy Shit, that was like the size of a Volkswagen beetle man. Oh my God. He's just looking at me. I'm thinking this is some dumb shit. Like, what am I doing? You know, what do I do? And that's a different buffalo buddy. That's a water buffalo animals school. There you go. Top is the bison. Yeah. Yeah. That's so wild. He just turns and looks at me and I'm like, Oh, I'm so fucked.

Speaker 2:          00:43:42       And uh, I didn't know what else to do. That thing took one more step forward towards him. I don't know what else to do because we're looking at, we were making and I just kinda like took. I didn't know, like he's going to charge me. I'm either running or what. So I took one more step. And you just kinda like often and him and his buddy ran, but when he started running me like the whole ground shook and I remember standing there looking at my friend thinking like, that could've been really bad. Oh yeah, you could be dead. No stairs steps. But there's. But it's open to the public and out there all the time is buffalo everywhere. So that's. How's that a winning combination? I like it. I do. I like it way better than I liked the idea of a zinsser nature. At your own risk. I think you should enter nature at your own risk. And I think nature should be natural. You're a big bow hunter, right? Yeah. Okay. We'd

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       started to talk was a dinner, but I moved. Remain his shit. You know, you shoot an Arrow and an elks ass and it doesn't kill it. You just piss it off and now you're 40 yards away from this thing. What do you do? Well, most importantly, you got to practice like before, especially if you're gonna shoot an Arrow, you, I practice every day. Really? Every day, every day I go somewhere and I shoot arrows. Something you should probably take seriously, you've got to take it so it's not like a rifle thing. No. See a rifle thing is, it's all just about understanding how to use the scope and understanding trigger discipline. You got to understand how to squeeze the trigger and not pull it, but archery involves a lot of weird hand eye coordination and balance. There's so many different factors going on. There's like a little site that you have and you have to balance that site out where the bubble is in the center.

Speaker 4:          00:45:24       You know the level brutal. You got to make sure that you're not torquing your go left or right. You gotta. Make sure that the peep peep site though the the little string hold that you're looking through lines up and eclipses perfectly. Your housing, you have to make sure that your hand is completely steady. You got to make sure you don't flinch at all when you release the arrow. There's so much going on. Any micro movement can add up to several feet left or right when it gets down past like 40 and fall. He was trying to control your attended. You know, target on the moving creature. Yeah. Moving creature and you have to make. You have to be good enough to make an ethical shot. Right? You know, you have to be good enough to, you know, and it's not easy man. It's not fucking easy.

Speaker 4:          00:46:12       So that's the most important thing. It's like there's a lot of guys that shouldn't be doing it because they're doing it. And I was gonna say all that said, when shit goes wrong in what you do. Well, you have to have a plan, right? If you, if you shoot an animal and a charge that you got to have a tree near you or something where you can get behind the tree, you know, but you've got to assume that if you hit an animal with an Arrow, the last thing wants to do is charge you. Unless it's a predator. Predator's might charge you. Like if you the real. There's a real possibility that if you hit a bear, although I know people that have hit a moose, my friend written Ella got run over by a moose. He shot it with a rifle and went to move in for the final shot of the thing was much better shape than he thought it was and it got up and charged him and knocked him over.

Speaker 4:          00:47:00       Yeah, and I seen another guy who shot a moose with a bow and the most charged them, but most of the time they want to get the fuck away from me. But again, it's not safe. It's not supposed to be, but it's real. I mean, if you are hunting an elk and you kill an elk with a bow and Arrow, you fucking killed an elk with a bow and arrow. It is real. It is 100 percent. That is a real elk. It's a wild fucking animal that doesn't have any rule book. There's no. There is no act break. There's no commercial time. It's a. that's a real 1000 pound wild horse with a tree growing out of his fucking head and it's horny. It's screaming.

Speaker 4:          00:47:42       This thing that's 10 times bigger than you is running up a hill with a tree grown out of his head. You know, you got to carry it out of there. Yeah, we got to cut it up. Well, we, the out that I shot, luckily we're close enough to get a truck nearby. But uh, I know guys that have had the camp them out, packed them out. Yeah. Because you know the smell and everything. You're drawing predators at night if you have to. There's got to be real careful but wolves to. I have a friend of mine who's going to be on next week, this Guy John Dudley, he was in Alberta and they shot an elk and they got it surrounded by wolves. The wolves trying to take the elk.

Speaker 4:          00:48:18       You said it was. Fuck. They killed two wolves like they got. They got charged by wolves. Yeah. It got real weird man. And he said, and once they had killed two, um, this alpha like hung around the edge of this ridge and looked down at them and just decided enough was enough and just went ghost. And they all disappeared the entire pack. But they were around him howling. He said he'd get here, look 12 distinctly different howls around them and they have an elk on the ground. Yeah, and people, you know, people say, oh, he killed a wolf. That guy's an asshole. They kill a lot of wolves up their folks and you might think that's terrible idea and that's horrible and it is

Speaker 4:          00:49:03       if you don't live there, but if you live there, fuck. They have to like, you don't understand. Everybody has this idea, and I talk about this way too much. I'll stop, but everybody had this idea of predators to delete some character in a movie that knows the script. They don't man the, the. You have to control their fucking populations. They just found 19 dead elk at these wolves killed in Wyoming. They just left them there. They just want our slaughter fest. They snuck into this pack of like some of those elpacs in Wyoming. You'll get like a hundred elk now. They're in its immense. These huge, huge packs of elk. What'd you call it? What would you call my herd? Herd of elk. And so this wolf pack jumped in there. Look at, look at all the elk. They killed 19 elk and they didn't need any of them. These kills killed them. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:49:55       Yeah. You know, like you said, unless you live there, it's hard to have an opinion one way or another. Everybody that has an opinion and it's all. I mean, people that have unrealistic opinions about wolves. Zoll coming from a beautiful place. It's coming from a place of light. They love animals. They do breed dogs and yeah, they do. Yeah. They have letters, man. Nothing's hunting them. Yeah. People are going with the Alphas. Good to breed. He better fucking read up on history. Natural his desk. Not True. They feel fuck dogs. Fuck like crazy. The alphas control most of the. Yeah, but it doesn't

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       mean the other ones don't. Fuck. There's a lot of bulbs. They have. They just did some recent survey on wolves in a, I believe it was Idaho and they were talking about how many of them there are like, whoa. Like this is kind of. They're far beyond where they thought that they needed to be before they would put them back on the hunting list, but they don't, they don't ever want to put them on. Like what happens is they reintroduced them in the nineties and before that they were pretty much wiped out by cattle ranchers and all these people throughout the west. There's very few like wild wolves and North America. And so they reintroduced these wolves from Canada that happened to be larger by the way.

Speaker 3:          00:51:10       They're larger wolves and the wolves that were naturally here. What did the native Americans do? Both the wolf population. Well, uh, they didn't. They mean they, they killed them certainly because they, they used to use their skin's a sneak up on bison actually. Here's a crazy fucking famous painting and iconic iconic painting of these, uh, American Indians with a wolf costume on, like they have a covering their body and they're crawling with a bow and Arrow up to these bison because bison weren't scared of wolves really hardcore shaking your head seriously. Yeah. Bisons don't. That's one of the reasons why there were so many of them. No other animals really had a very difficult time taking them out. Look at this. There's the picture. That's like an icon. That's exactly how it went and looked at me. Or is there going to be bone chilling? How did that feel? Like staring that thing down, man. I froze. I literally froze because I just started. Didn't know what to do. Could be the end of your themes you're standing relating to realize I'm, I've just put myself on a horrendously bad situation. The amount of force they could generate. You can't even resist it. There's nothing you could do. You're just completely helpless. Like there's literally nothing you could do. They run faster than you and there, you know, that's a 1500 to 2000 pound animal.

Speaker 3:          00:52:35       The Indians snuck up on him like that. And um, my friend Steve Rinella and not Steven Rinella, remy warrant. He has this television show called Apex Predator. And um, they did all these different episodes on the ways different animals hunt their prey and see if he could recreate it. And that's one of the things that he did. He took a wolf skin and put it on him and crawled up to these buffalo and got like right inside them. Yeah, but they're afraid of us. Well, they're afraid of people because of bang sticks. True to the. I was saying earlier, I forgot what I was talking about for a second, but a friend of mine as a guide in Colorado and they found these mountain lion tracks like all these mountain lion tracks and then elk tracks and then the mountain lion tracks and the elk tracks together and then there's a space of like several hundred yards,

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       whether it was just elk tracks and so they followed that elk track and they found a mountain lion on top of the elk killing it. His fucking giant elk, like thousand pound elk. He said it was a huge six by six, so you're talking about it in a mature animal and this mountain lion. I was like, fuck it, I'm going for it. And he jumped on this thing and clamped a whole of its back and then brought it down the mountain line weight 150 pounds. So it took out this thousand plus pound elk by jumping on his back and biting its neck. You guys get them down in the valley and allies? Yeah. Encroaching killed a Koala bear at the zoo the other day.

Speaker 1:          00:54:07       Yeah. Now are taking it seriously. They're like, how the fuck did it get in? It's got a 12 foot high fence. There's razor wire on the top panel. Sneaky as cat, man. Come on. It's so that little fucker that you walk. And it was like [inaudible]. I know, but he climbed over barbed wire. That's hardcore. Dude. That's hard. As fucking court gets 12 foot high fence barbed wire at the top was like, hmm, good try. Good try. He probably got caught up a bit, but whatever. He's a mountain lion. They probably hear like that to in 150 pound cat. Yeah. Like if you're riding your bike one day, one of those things falls over tree on your head. It's going to God with these big old saber teeth and like take you to the ground and fucking play with you for awhile. It's not just going to kill you.

Speaker 1:          00:55:00       You know? It's gonna, it's gonna miss with the size of that fucker. That's the one that lives up to the Hollywood hills. That's the one that they think killed the Koala bear. That's a lion. A lion. I mean, that's like a lion in Africa. Lion. Look the fucking forearms on that. Like those forums. It would be awful. That isn't Stetson. Insane amount of power. That thing was have. And they say that pound for pound. They're one of the strongest cats on my shoulders and arms. My Gut, I'll tell you right now for Bobcat, tries to fuck with me. I'll fuck up a bobcat. I'm pretty, pretty confident I'll kick a bobcat's ass, but it still wouldn't be fun. No, I'm kidding man. Look, I have cats and I have to wash them. And uh, my, my daughter is allergic to cats and the way we, the only way we communicate is we have to shave them.

Speaker 1:          00:55:50       So they get a buzz cut like a lion's cut and washed them. And it makes a giant difference in how much damage are they leave. They leave because they're both like really fluffy cats. They would leave cat hair everywhere, but so this solution made a bit, but I have to fucking hold onto these little fuckers, why they get shaved and man, even though like they love me and that, you know, when they want to go man, they want to go and you realize like how difficult they are to controls Agila yeah. That fucking boot. They twist and contort fucking to kick it off yet. And it, this big long sinewy

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       relaxed muscles that all of a sudden you're like, Holy Shit, you're actually a little bodybuilder. Okay. You're just so lucky. We're so much bigger than them. But with a mountain lion as a Bobcat, I'm gonna. Come, come get some bobcat. I'll fuck you up, bitch. It'd probably be terrified. That was a cute one. That's a links though. I don't think that's a bobcat. Those, uh, there's. See those weird links is they have in Canada. Those white never been to Canada, man. No, actually it's not true. I've been to Canada. I've just never been up to the part of Canada that I'd really like to see. They have these weird cats, man. They don't even look real. They look like a star wars cat. It's called a lynx lynx and they have these crazy big paws with [inaudible] serious. Look at that weird ears. Yeah, come on man.

Speaker 3:          00:57:08       That's like an animal. Go some Turkish delight. Yeah. Look at that. That doesn't even look real. Look at that cat. Tell me. That looks real. That looks like something from some weird movie. Like the proportions. I go back to Jamie. They'll get the proportions of its body. It's so odd. Giant feet long as big legs. Just so weird. Body man. And that thing is just up there earning just earning. Just out there hustling everyday jacket shit with its face. Like what does it hunt and Canada I guess everything. I'm sure. Small things. I don't think they get that big. I mean if I had to guess, I would say links probably only gets to be like 50 pounds. See what it see how big they get. See if I'm right. I don't think they get much bigger than that, but I think they, they probably eat.

Speaker 3:          00:57:57       I'm 24 pounds. Okay. I think they probably eat like rabbits and squirrels or Fonz. They'll definitely eat fonz. We found this fucked up video of this Martin, uh, Martin chasing a rabbit. You know, what a Martin is, what was the play it for him? Jamie Martin. Martin is an animal that I always associated with for because of those Alaska shows, you know, those shows where the dudes are living up in Alaska. There's one called mountain men and this guy runs a food trap line and one of the things that he trapped is Martin Martin. It's like a little badger and it's chasing after a rabbit. So the little black thing and the back is the PA is the Martin and this is a literally a run for life. Look at this rabbit is going fuck, fuck. And the Martins hustling behind him. He was moving. Fuck you at is.

Speaker 3:          00:58:47       And this is like a crazy sprint. I mean they're both sprinting. It's like how long can they do it for? And the Martin just is relentless and these people are filming this for their fucking car. Following them behind them on the road. And uh, the Martin just finally the rabbit starts trying to veer off the road and he gets into the sick shit and the Martin closes the distance. But look at the drama here. It runs better on the Hong Bitch. Oh my God. Yeah. And what's crazy is they're the same size. In fact, the Martin is smaller. The rabbit look at the difference things mean as shit. Oh yeah man. I mean he just carried it up by its face. That's jumping. He, he's like, he's like, he hit a nitro button or something, but he knew the end was near. It was cool. Yeah. Imagine if you are download rabbit hole on this thought with a dude to the death with your faces, right? You're good. You killed them with your face and then dragged him up a hill with your face all in the course of 15 seconds from the time that Martin got ahold of that rabbit, that rabbit is dead as fuck. And he was carrying away in 15 seconds with this phase.

Speaker 2:          01:00:00       No. One of my good buddies is a radiology technician and he must, he sees all kinds of horrible shit happening to people every day. You know what I mean? That's why I'm thankful. I just have to get up and try to sing in pitch ever to make money. He said the worst thing he ever told me was a, there was a guy who was driving along on his way to work. One morning he hit a deer, the deer, the body split in half and the ass end of the deer came up over the hood and through his windshield. And I was just intestines and blood and shit and guts everywhere. All literally like the glass room. And she'll cut his face all up. So now he's got all this shit down in the blood and in his face. Uh, so they bring this guy. And so he came in and was like, went through the windshield and laid down in this creek bed. Like after he hits the deer and lay there. And while I was like laying in the damn creek bed, raccoons came and snacked on his fucking face. So then when these guided of living, but I mean between all the bacteria. So he got jacked. Yeah, hit a deer. All that shit happened and I guess he liked came out of the truck and then laid down in this ditch until they found him like, you know, however many hours later. And while he was laying there unconscious wild woodland creatures had came and eaten the open dude had a bad day.

Speaker 3:          01:01:26       How much of his face got bitten off?

Speaker 2:          01:01:29       Oh Man, I'll, I'll. Patrick said it was not pretty holy fuck man. And the donor didn't actually live. Oh God. You know, I don't know that I'd want to survive something like that or maybe you do. I always want to survive. But

Speaker 3:          01:01:43       yeah, you always want to survive. You just want to survive just to kill as many fucking raccoon can be. Like the best raccoon hunter ever. That day on the, a raccoon serial killer. Just standing in front of trash cans. A rifle. Yeah. I'm glad I don't have to work at a hospital. Oh Dude, I have a buddy was an emt. Tell me some stories. The craziest stories. My friend Steve, he's an ophthalmologist and he did his residency in Miami during the cocaine days and he's played. He's like, dude, you don't even fucking nothing to this day. This Guy Steve is strapped

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       everywhere. He goes, yeah. He wears a fucking gun everywhere. He doesn't play games. She lives in Arizona and one of the reasons why he likes Arizona because you can conceal carry. It just seemed too much. He saw too much early on, you know he, he told me just every day was just gunshot to the head. Gunshot to the head, gunshot to the head like you're in.

Speaker 2:          01:02:42       Yeah, yeah. How are you going to maintain any kind of positive outlook and you can't just get completely burned out.

Speaker 4:          01:02:49       You get out of it and he got out of it. When he got out of it, it was just like this big breath. I whoa, what the fuck that I just experienced, but now the knowledge that not only was that a real thing that he was experiencing on a daily basis, all that insane violence and all the gunshots, all the craziness. He knows that even if it's not like that anymore, like even if people, there's the cocaine days are Kinda over. Miami is much more calm. The violence not as back. He knows that that is what people are capable of within his lifetime. I'm, you still see this shit all. I bet you do, but I think there was a level of it during the eighties in Miami. Do you know who billy Corbin is? The a documentary filmmaker names. Familiar. He's got these two great documentaries called cocaine cowboys. Cowboys too. Yeah, and billy. He's been on the podcast before talking about it, but he did a great job of showing how insane that time was. Which one of the things that he talked about was how one year, the graduating class of the police academy, every single one of them within like a year was either dead or in jail.

Speaker 4:          01:04:01       They had been murdered or they were in jail for corruption. Like the whole police department was just massively corrupt. Everyone was doing cocaine. There was murders like crazy all left and right. All around. It was just complete chaos.

Speaker 2:          01:04:16       Yeah. Who's the little. One of the guys' names from the documentary, the white dude with the mustache, that was kind of like a ringleader of it all. Yeah. I think he went to prison and he's out.

Speaker 4:          01:04:25       Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy who flew the planes very. The money and the yards. I don't remember his name either, but I remember the lady Grizelda or Zelda godmother. Oh, the lady. I think she's still alive, man. I mean she might've died recently, but I think she was alive and free and Columbia. She's living in South America for a long time. And hiring. Yeah. She got out of jail in America and you know, if, if her hitman who was in jail was in the documentary, is being honest about how many people she killed. Like, Whoa, whoa. Jack. She launched, died in 2012. Ah, there you go. So when the second movie was made, they focused on her and her being released. Oh my God. What a crazy time. But so my friend Steve, you just saw all that man. Just, he

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       saw a guy with a light bulb up his ass for what? Someone's stuffed a light bulb up their ass. You know when those twisty light bulbs don't like Christmas tree looking, they put this up my ass. Big Ass one. You know? I mean, I say it looks like Christmas tree. I don't mean like a little one that's on your tree. I'm talking about several inch long. Light Bulb was stuffed up. This dude's ass. People get bored, man. Yeah, he. They found everything. Wine, champagne, corks, all sorts of different objects like coffee cups and stuff. Yeah. You ever heard any stories like that? I guess it's also probably correlates with the cocaine days. They're probably just sticking things in every hole. They had hats off to anybody. I can work a coffee because you and your ass so that it was fun seeing all this stuff like that. The, the different layers of society you're dealing with on a day to day basis and having to hold a any type of firm belief in humanity or civilization. I don't know where a person. I think

Speaker 4:          01:06:30       even people that don't see violence like people maybe that see just a lot of accidents. That's got to be spooky. They say that a lot of women who are like emt, I have a hard time settling down and like having families, like they get whacked out by it. Like particularly that might be sexist to say I don't think it is because uh, I think that's something that I've heard female ain't emt talk about just their own personal experiences, but that it's so, so dark. Like everyday you're seeing broken necks and broken legs. It's car accidents and people splattered on the road and you know, Uhm, because grueling after awhile.

Speaker 1:          01:07:13       So what's like ptsd numbers like unprofessional, like that. I mean, you got to be having some trauma. Oh yeah, for sure. You know,

Speaker 4:          01:07:20       um, there's a certain amount of stress that I think comes with any kind of job where you're looking at death a lot. I mean, how much ptsd does a doctor have? Like emergency room doctors, how much do they just get accustomed to it? I think it takes a very special type of personality, you know? I think it also, it is, does man. I think it's really a lot like what we were talking about when you're taking in all these stories in the world because you can manage your own life, but you're not. You're. If you're paying attention to the news, you're going to get inundated with stories by the 7 billion people and it's just too much. It's just too much data coming at you and too much of it negative. I think that's probably the same way with like an emergency room doctor. Like it's okay if you see somebody get hurt once in your life a few times in your life or, or maybe even, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:08:06       like you, you can get desensitized. They're not processing. Again, it's just, it's onto the next case. You can definitely desensitized. It doesn't, it's not. It doesn't freak you out anymore. You see a guy whose leg is hanging off and you know, I mean, especially guys who are taking care of troops, you know, or emt. Oh my God. Oh my God. People were shooting at you. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. I tried to carry them out while bullets are flying. It's insanity. Again. I'll just try to sing in key math and I know we've got it easy. It's just fascinating how many different ways to be a person there are. You know, how many different different kinds of lives you can live, how many different types of experiences you can have and your reality could be so much different than somebody else's reality and you're convinced that your reality is life and they're convinced that there is life.

Speaker 1:          01:09:05       You know, like what we're talking about with the wolves. Like those people that live near those things that are fucking shitting their pants when they hear those howls at night. My buddy lives in BC and his neighbor's cow was taken out by wolves. While they're all watching, they're all looking out the window they're going to do. Can't do shit. He can go out and start shooting for to get full and fuck off. You can go out and start shooting, but it's dark. Unless you have pretty nice scope. I could live up there, but yeah, the winters I think would just be. That's the thing. They're ruthless, but anywhere that's. It's too nice. You get too many people. Like we were talking about Los Angeles is too perfect. Everyday the weather's perfect, but because of that you have to bring carbon monoxide air. Uh, you know, have a.

Speaker 1:          01:09:55       yesterday it was the first time I'd ever, at some point I think we're, my family was ready for an adventure or a relocation. But yeah, I don't know that I could ever acclimate no matter how long I was here to convincing myself that the traffic is worth it, worth it. It doesn't. You don't have to live here. See, that's the beautiful thing about southern California is you could live in San Diego, La Jolla, like, which is beautiful and quiet and fucking picture ask. You see the ocean's right there. So pretty. Like the northern part of the state law to northern part stays amazing. I was in Mendocino over by where the ocean is. It's like three hours plus maybe four hours north of San Francisco. So pretty man soap or the redwood forest. We went through the redwood forest, did all that shit, was so pretty. The Monterey once for a meeting with my booking agency, the people who live there get it pretty, pretty well. That does not suck than uh, some friends of St Louis Obispo. That's really, that's a nice spot to. Those places are calm, right? Really Mellow. Yeah. Real mellow. My Buddy John Lives in San Luis Obispo. It was about 15 years younger la, which would seem like a good idea right now. Santa Barbara. Real nice to really

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       love it there. I'm going, I've got a gig there on Friday night, Santa Barbara. It's like, I don't think it's more than 100,000 plus. People don't think it's very big. Man was shooter. Loves it out here. He's lived out here. Well, well he's crazy. Shooter shooter lives in the heart of darkness. Was An apartment in Los Filez. He's a crazy man. He's like, you know, he loves it. Shooters. Such a character. I love that guy who just got on a plane. Oh, he's the best. He's also just like such a character, like who he is as a person. Know we had him in here and he was talking about, about doing meth was like, Oh yeah, I've done math night. Shit.

Speaker 3:          01:12:02       Like, come on man, you ain't done math. Never tried. Plank road trucker. Craig is a talented guy too. And I also liked that. Um, you know, you could listen to any one of his albums and it's like, oh, okay. He's obviously in some totally different phase in this album. He's just trying some other shit out. He's one of them were naturally and genuinely curious and interested, interested, you know, like when he's listening to you and asking questions, he actually means it. Oh yeah, yeah. Which is a rare thing in the music business coming from the sun of royalty. Right. You know, I mean, his dad was royalty. I mean there's, there's a few musical icons that you look at it and you go, well that's like in the royal 100, 100 percent. You know, Waylon Jennings is in the fucking royal 100. I mean there's just, there's just people that are in, you know, Chuck Berry's in, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 3:          01:13:00       He's in forever. Waylon Jennings is in, he's in, that's his son, so for him to be so normal and also be a musician and not be some Weirdo who fucking desperately craves attention or needs validation, he's a genuine artist and very content. If anything, I've seen him use his position to only try to help other people instead of himself, unless the truth man. Uh, well his mom was obviously so nice to. Oh yeah, she's so nice. So and, and really like sharp and smart. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Paying attention. Oh yeah man, it's cool to talk to him. It's so weird. Businessman trying to. I mean everyone out there, everyone. I think that's true. Everyone that's not like some sort of a perfect person. He's trying to do better with their life, you know, trying to improve on whatever you're doing, whether it's your job or your business or whatever. Whatever your hobby is, your obsession. We're all trying to improve on it. But one of the

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       weird things about being a musician and I guess a comic as well, is that you're doing that in front of everybody. You know, like your developed. We're all developing as humans, you know, but you're also, you're performing in front of all those people.

Speaker 2:          01:14:28       Yeah, it is. Uh, when you, when you write songs, I guess you can't ever stop to think, oh, I have to sing this, the restroom,

Speaker 1:          01:14:37       my life. You know what I mean? You could have the crowd you don't know. Like that's our. Well, like for me, I was, I don't know, I liked the song is just a lot of people really like that sounds bad ass. I play that song, that gym almost every time I workout. That's a bad ass song. You just do close to. It was too close to the oil. Yeah. It was a laundry list about

Speaker 2:          01:15:02       my, my, my view on laundry lists. Experienced. Yeah. It's just such a great song though. Yeah. We'll dig that one back out. It was Tom, tom to work it up, I think in a new way and make it fresh for us. I don't know. For me, man, I love the recording process most. Most of all. Really. That's, that's, that's where you learn. If you've improved, you know, you're under a microscope, a get hyperfocused in the studio, it's a good thing. Other people get tired or I'd probably just keep them in there all day, you know what I mean? And then, but it's almost like you're so tied to this thing in, in, in it that by the time it's finished you just don't even want to think about it anymore. You want to, you gets like, all right, well that's done, right. You know, but now you got to work it up and go out in a live context and, and play this thing. Whereas hopefully you've, you've tried to bare your soul and be as honest as possible, but then you're standing in front of a room every night so you have to block that part of it out of, out of your head that like people are judging you, you know? Uh, and it's also part of it too, you know, you're living that life experience out in real time. So it's all been really educational and new for me in terms of figuring out how to navigate that is artistic away as possible without compromising anything. I guess

Speaker 1:          01:16:28       I think we all learned from each other in that way. You know, it's got to sell. Yeah. Are you going get to do it anymore? Yeah. Don't you learn from other musicians in that way? Do you see like how other guys are handling it or how they, uh, how it influences their creative process? Does it influence you?

Speaker 2:          01:16:47       Oh, I mean you definitely noticed traits in other people that you wish you had more of or that you could maybe adhere to and it's, and it's motivating and, but like he said, you know, it's just about trying to be a better person. Yeah. And uh, and use whatever outlet this is in order to hopefully make other people feel good to, um, or to deal with things that maybe they don't know how to express, which for me I think is the most important part of making music. And so that's what it's always given me in the past before I was a performer and I just loved it from a sheer listeners position, you know, offers is a lot of comfort. And um, I don't know, people tell you this after the shows that you're making an impact on their life and you know, some, uh, my buddy Jordan said that his friend, her grandmother's land in her hospital bed and the last thing she heard, she played her one of my songs, like, you know, that song, my voice, she just said, wow, he's got a really pretty voice and she's like totally relaxed, you know.

Speaker 2:          01:17:47       So you hear things like that and it's, it's easy to get hung up on mechanics or expectations or pressures or the industry and all that. But like it feels like if you just kind of stepped back and hit pause, it's easy to remember that anybody doing this job is very lucky to be able to do this job. And for me like, uh, I don't think, I think in a lot of ways the modern media and industry have sorta not ruined music, but it's made it really hard for people to focus on what is really about, you know, it's like life is all of a sudden one big episode of the voice. And it's all about the year end lists and who says this is better than what? And seen somebody, the artists better than somebody art and I just don't think that that's ever like a healthy thing, if that makes sense. Making a competition out of something that's supposed to make everybody feel included.

Speaker 1:          01:18:39       Well it's definitely contrary to what seems to be your primary focus, which is making the best music for you, for your expression. D, expressing yourself in the best way you can and making something that's going to impact people in a, in a, in a way where your thoughts are going to get across, they're going to be moved by it. You can't do that. If you're thinking about winning awards, a contract selling lots of or selling or any of those things like promoting it business, you know, like anytime you, you not to say that it's impossible. I mean there is there it's horrible. Like some people do sell a lot of records. Impacting people's lives with great music is out there. Music sells. Yeah. Period. It always finds a way. I mean it's going to sell whether your. But like, did you see amy, amy, amy winehouse documentary on her records?

Speaker 1:          01:19:27       That's what I heard the DAP kings for, for this new one man. Just the sound of what they did on those albums. Amazing. She's such as musician. She was so like her sound, what she put together was so high. But to see how the intense pressure of being, you know, amy winehouse in quotes mean she was, or Justin Bieber or anybody else. He likes that surrounded by enablers and kept copacetic all the time and just. Yes, yes, yes. You know, you got to do other things man. You gotta be grounded, you know, and I think you've got to go home and roll around and play with blocks. Yep. That's what got to do to get in the pool with them. They surf on my back.

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       I go under water and swim and they try to stand on me. It's hard to hold your breath for as long as it takes for five-year-old. Stand on your back as you're floating. But, but I mean other things as well, like as far as not just family and loved ones and friends, which are definitely important. But I also think that other disciplines are important. Other focuses of other things that are equally interested in, you know, because they alleviate some of the pressure of what it is to be singularly focused on one thing which we can get to the point of madness in know unit does. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:20:44       I got a drum kit I got really into playing drums but six months ago just to. It's meditational man, you have to relax to do it well and you're not thinking about anything else. And once I realized that, I was like, oh, this is really good for me. And uh, but yeah, that's my thing. I'm. So this music thing, once it becomes a career, you have to be singularly focused. Especially when thinking about a record man, my wife, she just kind of leaves me alone while she sees me go to that weird platelet processing place. You know what I mean? Because it's like she, you know, it's like nothing else is in the room anyway for awhile and then I'm done and you just feel like, okay, and then you don't write a song for a year.

Speaker 4:          01:21:22       Well she seems very smart and support. She could recognize that that's, that's so important. I have friends that are in relationships where the wife is not very supportive and it resists the creative process and it gives them, it doesn't understand it or

Speaker 2:          01:21:37       cheers was very creative too. So she understands very independent. So it's been an only child, you know, I, she knows like there's just some times where I have to go and be a mom.

Speaker 4:          01:21:50       Yeah, space. I just don't think you get to work you're doing right now. I don't think you get to that state unless you're a little crazy. You have to be. You got to be locked into it, man. You know, like by the way, I'm so sorry I leaked the name of your album out it. I love it. I love it. I really did on Instagram, but it was fucking good man. I was in the gym and uh, and I said, God damn, people got to hear about this. I was so high. I was in Colorado and when you get high in Colorado, when you're at 8,000 feet or Utah, actually 8,000 feet, it just hits you in some crazy, uh, you feel like you're on a spaceship, like on top of the world, like your, you're like, I was feeling like I was connected to the world and some really weird way and it was at the gym just barbecued and that, that album was so. It was so good, especially in that moment at the gym. Endorphins flowing. And then he sent me a text, hey man, I think he leaked the name of the album.

Speaker 4:          01:22:56       I went, oh no, I didn't even think of that

Speaker 2:          01:23:00       man feel. Honestly at this point it's uh, this is definitely a record that

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       anybody that knows about me, I would like them to hear as a record because that's how I wrote, recorded it to be heard. Well, that's one of the interesting aspects of it. Yeah. It's obviously I'm one piece. Yeah. Well, you um, you sent me two versions of it, it was kind of cool to, or the people did, they sent me one version which is just one recording and then the other one is side two and then another one where all the songs were broken down individually song. But it almost feels like I shouldn't be looking at that, you know? I mean ideally I would, that's not how I wasn't designed to be heard, broken apart I guess. But people like to hear like one song, if they're in the car for 10 minutes on the way home to like to hear one song, it's not a bad thing.

Speaker 1:          01:23:56       Know all of my favorite records, like have my top four or five records are all concept records and most of them are in song cycle, which is what they call it. Like you know, like dark side of the moon where it's just one continuous wall, the wall or the wall or what's going on. But Marvin Gaye, what's going on was one console and song cycle that was written from the narrative of a Vietnam vet returning home to like an inner city home. And trying to adapt to society. Again, it's a heavy album man. And then astral weeks by Van Morrison, if you've ever heard that record, that's some powerful dope. No, I haven't. Um, it's all about the journey of your soul. The soul's life. Whoa. I never got into van Morrison other than she's one of my favorite songs ever. I always wonder what that was.

Speaker 1:          01:24:43       That's what he called his commercial album because astral weeks, although it's now considered probably one of the greatest records ever recorded in silvery will because it was two RC for a lot of people. So then he turned around and intentionally made a more commercially accessible album. She was moondance and course sold a gazillion copies. Whenever I think about Marvin Gaye, I think about this check that date because when Marvin Gaye got shot and killed by his dad here in La, right? I don't know where he was in Los Angeles by a tragic story. He got shot and killed by his own father. The girl I was dating goes, what kind of a horrible person must have been that his dad shot him. I went, what worked?

Speaker 1:          01:25:30       But that was how she viewed the world. Like your father shot you. You must have been a horrible person. So fuck, fuck him. He's probably my favorite musician. Veltassa. I'll know more about Marvin Gaye then we want to go into really as a really dark story. Yeah. Yeah. The council, he's a, there was a lot of that. Him and his dad had things that stemmed from childhood things. Dad was a preacher one but also a cross dresser. And so Marvin I think was ridiculed a lot and Carlotta shamed for that and his dad was very strict, really tyrannical

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       rule in the house and beat his mom a lot. So a lot of Marvin sexual deviancy later on and they think probably stemmed from, from some of that. But I mean it was just a really highly sensitive guy and in a genius at that, uh, don't know what kind of sexual deviancy was he involved in war? You never heard that. I'm like, err the gas dirty laundry. But if there's books about it he's doing, he's like s and m bondage. I think he had a free, pretty substantial porn collection. Oh, okay. Like the talk has a 17 year old girlfriends and the [inaudible] and threesomes and that kind of thing. That was illegal back then. He was just living, Bro, got on the radio and it went from there. But I think after the height of his fame and he was best selling record, he was married to the daughter of the president of motown or sister or one of the other and she divorced him basically and took everything like the whole fortune and to smoking crack in a bread truck and Hawaii and him.

Speaker 2:          01:27:06       This is after he's Marvin fucking gay. You know what I mean? Yeah. And then, uh, just went down hill from there. Nobody could get to him or help him out. So we had to move back in with his parents as a grown ass man and while he's Marvin fucking gay. And then they think a lot of people say that's where the source of all the trauma and pain him going back to that, at that stage in his life was the worst thing that could have happened. Being around his dad, his dad apparently had an argument and he, uh, told his dad like if he ever touched his mom again, he killed him and his dad said, well, if you ever lay a hand on me, I'll kill you. And I think on some people speculate that Marvin was just so done with all of it.

Speaker 2:          01:27:46       The fame and everything that he knew by punching his father, it would get him out of it was dad shot him twice upstairs in the bedroom. Oh my God. And then the, I think he laid there for about 20 minutes bleeding in the that the ambulance showed up. The paramedics couldn't come into the House as long as the dad was still in there with the gun. So I think his sister in law brother somebody to come in and like find the gun that his father had hidden. Who's? He wasn't talking. Oh Man. It took. So by the time they got him out of the house, Marvin died in the ambulance to the hospital.

Speaker 7:          01:28:21       Woo.

Speaker 2:          01:28:23       That's heavy man.

Speaker 7:          01:28:26       Fuck

Speaker 2:          01:28:28       what a crazy story really said. It is a terrible story. It's you always. When you, when you hear about a guy that has this, it's almost like overwhelming desire to express himself, you know, like when you have a song like what's going on or if you have a song like a let's get it on, you know, devastating.

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       Come on. I mean there's some intense memory because emotional connection to what he's doing is just so off the charts and a lot of times that's almost like energized by dark moments in your life. Oh yeah. Dark memories could, it overwhelms those, those pot. Even the positive things. You showed me a happy well adjusted artists and I'll show you some boring fucking art road. Yeah, let's get it on. Shit that you got a girl that likes to get. Let's get it on. You got a good one. He, I think she was 17 when he wrote that album for really a little young mistress. Jesus, that's dark. Telling her how much he wanted to do the deed for record 17. So there's a song called really love to ball landed that album. Really? Yeah. And it's just like women moaning and orgasm and really goes was fearless man. Shit. Just get away with it too. At that time it was probably sold so many records, so I didn't tour. He never toured. Really? Hardly ever really. Couldn't drag him out on stage. No. Shit really. I think when, when let's get it on, was blowing up. He was living in a cabin up in top of Topanga Canyon with his girlfriend and just hiding from the world doing blow.

Speaker 1:          01:30:33       Literally. He played one concert that entire record cycle. That's where everybody lived back then. I saw Hendrix house was for sale a few years back as a house at Hendricks bought. They never moved into. He bought it right before he died. I'll take it. Even if even if he did live there, I'm like, I'll still buy it. I need to know if he. If he. Did he write something anywhere? It was it in paper that he walk in and he was there. He probably, he must have bought it so he had to look at it. So if you looked at it, he was in there. So he walked around. I take it. He probably bone the realtor. Fucking take it. Well, there was a house that was for sale that was wilt Chamberlain's house that had the whole deal. It had a circular bed that spun around. It was like the ultimate fuck castle and you know, will chamberlain on his way to Bang in 10,000 different women allegedly according to him, you know, and he had just this insane bachelor pad.

Speaker 1:          01:31:33       That was just. How did he get anything else? Look at it. Look at it. That's this house. Look at that bad. That's the way it looks like the enter the Dragon. Mr Han's fucking palace or something is going on there, bro. Fuck yeah. I'd be walking around and they're like trying to find myself in the mirror. Oh look at that shit a few years back. That house is that the outside of it. A few years back the house was for sale. It's an epic epic house. Like I'll fuck my dog too. I'm not afraid. But they had a really hard time selling it because it was worth a lot of money. That place, man, it was worth a lot of money and it wasn't the kind of house that a normal person could live in one bedroom chamberlain's bungalow. Would you see that now? Look at the pool tables like whereas knees are.

Speaker 1:          01:32:25       It's hilarious. I wonder if that house ever sold. It might be one of those things that you just keep selling them buying, but it's really funky. Like modern for the 19 eighties. Look in the crew man. Oh yeah man, look at that place. It's all angular and shit. Like a transformer to two and a half acres. Like it's. You're expected to go something like that. So for now here, even if it wasn't wilt Chamberlain's house, what's something that's a $10,000,000, $10,000,000 depending on where it is. If that's in the Hollywood hills. Yeah. That fucking crazy palace with the wave pool is like, look at all the. I mean that's a piece of art that's not just a house. You'd have to have the right buyer. What am I real estate guy flipping houses all of a sudden, fuck. Do I know? I don't even know how much toothpaste cost telling you how much this house is.

Speaker 1:          01:33:15       I'd say 10 million now. It's a good number. I want to say it's dope house. No less than 10 million. Two thousand seven. It was 10 point five. Bitch. What the fuck? I'm talking about white man tend to. The point five is the negotiating. That's where. That's the wiggle room from 11 point five, so it's sold for eight years ago. That's how much it was for sale. It was listed at 11 point five. Oh, it was down to 10 point five. So it might still be available. No, I bet. Well, I bet a house like that. People buy it and they go, what the fuck are we doing here? Let's make some money. It's in Bel Air and then they sell that thing. Oh, bill there. Yeah. That's an expensive neighborhood. Dope views must be good to be wilt chamberlain back with no Internet. No twitter, no facebook.

Speaker 1:          01:34:01       Just all dick. Yeah. Those guys really just mean free for all. Oh yeah, come on man. It's chaos. The president, President Kennedy was on a free for all. I mean, imagine that the president just call him buck wild. What's amazing is that everyone in the news, like all the reporters, they all knew it. Yeah, they didn't. They didn't talk about it. It was me stories written about it. Well, I wonder what that shift was. The shift was in America where they decided that they were just going to talk about everything. Like what caused sold. Yeah, I guess so. Right. Once I figured out that's all people want is gossip was like once there was too many different distribution methods, it seems like that's what it is. Right? Like if you only have like a couple of different newspapers and a couple of different television shows, it can all be kind of controlled. I monopolize go. Yeah. And you also put pressure on the reporters probably did not reveal that stuff and that. And I'm, it's, you

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       know, like something on the radio in the car when I was coming here about, there was a big data models today. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't gotten into it hurt the cliff notes, but it sounds pretty heavy. It's supposed to be the biggest leak of documentary millions of pages or. Yeah, and apparently it just shows all this crazy collusion between world leaders and financial. I used to obsess about that shit and I wanted to know, you know, like man, but now at this stage in my life, I mean

Speaker 4:          01:35:27       I just go ahead and assume it's all fucking crooked and so it is definitely all crooked, but you know what I think, man, I don't even think. I mean, I think everybody's got to pay attention to it obviously. I mean we're all paying attention to it, but I don't think it's sustainable. I don't think you could do it anymore. I think these leaks are going to come more and more frequently and they're going to be more and more accessible and more and more easy to get. I just don't think you're gonna be able to fuck people like that anymore. I just don't think you could do it. Even the government, I don't think they could do it anymore. I think what they're doing now, even right now, they're like Klingon, just hanging onto this thing while it's shaken. Apart around them, because the apple fiasco and supposed to be in control of us, man, that's the bottom line.

Speaker 4:          01:36:09       You're not supposed to be in control of Jamie. Jamie's not supposed to be in control of me and the government's not supposed to be in control. You. You're supposed to be some operating principles that we all commune under and our community should be established in a way that benefits us. Not the big banks, not the politicians, not fucking Hillary Clinton, given $250,000 speaker speeches to a bunch of Wall Street people. That's all nonsense and that's some old shit that we just assume we have to stay with because it's been this way from the jump. It's been this way since we were kids. While my parents grew up with it and this is the system bullshit. They're staying with this system. Not because it's the best, but because they figure the best way to extract money from it. You can't. You're not gonna be able to do it. It's not going to happen. Once president trump gets in office, everyone's going to realize what a fucking God damn joke of a system we put in place and there'll be some real talk about having some kind of a radical reform.

Speaker 2:          01:37:05       Like what if they could just fire members of the Senate or the House representatives or congress that you're fired. You can't just say, we're not going to do our jobs. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:37:17       Well, dishes too many people that you don't know that have any say whatsoever on how you live your life, like the idea that the Senate or that Congress or that the Supreme Court and these people could sit down and decide like what you can can't do with your body, what substances you can or can't put into them, which shouldn't, shouldn't be illegal like that. You. You shouldn't be able to decide that.

Speaker 2:          01:37:42       The Nixon thing the other day, it was pretty interesting about where they were just like, yeah, we should do anything. We just, you know. Yeah. We'll tell people what it was. They. There was a former aide, I think. Was that, was that right? Somebody in his. Yeah. Someone basically came out and said that the war on drugs was propagated to suppress minorities and a anti war movement, Antiwar Movement, and they, they knew that there was no threat there and it wasn't doing anything harmful to people and and basically they're on tape talking about it and laughing. Unbelievable. Somebody on late night the other night when it came out, they said it perfectly like that. Even from the grave. That guy manages to cultivate more fucking hatred. It was so crazy. Dude. What? Evil Bastard.

Speaker 4:          01:38:23       Yeah. It was last week. Quote from Richard Nixon's former chief domestic advisor, John Eric, Eric, Min e h r I c h Dot Heckman surfaced confirming a disgusting truth that's been very well known by black folks for for several decades of war on drugs. Had nothing to do with eradicating it drug epidemic. Instead, it was a ploy to hide for the intentional targeting and decimating of the black community. Well, as well as the real thing. This is Eric Men's words. He said the Nixon campaign in 1968 in the Nixon White House after that had two enemies. The antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew that we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and the blacks with heroin and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. Wow. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news.

Speaker 4:          01:39:23       Holy fucking shit. Did we know we were lying about drugs? Of course we did. Whoa. Damn. That's dark. That guy's only concentrating on black people though. Do you go to an all black site that guys just wants to talk about? The black part is you got a big smiling black phase. The whole thing is disgusting. It's disgusting that we live under the echoes of all these morons that were running the country back then. All these creeps that could get away with shit just like wilt chamberlains up there banging up a storm and Marvin Gaye's cooked up into pain canyon with a 17 year old. You can get away with anything back then. Apparently. You still can't. R Kelly. Paula r Kelly allegedly, but that's, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:40:08       Dick Cheney, you could just shoot people the fucking face. Literally. Yeah. Literally.

Speaker 4:          01:40:13       Well those. Do you know what he was doing? It's a canned hunt. So those are weird man. Do you know what that is? That's really go out and you're basically guaranteed a trophy. No bird hunting. So what happens is they go out and they um, they open up these fucking boxes of birds and the birds fly out and they shoot them and he's still shot somebody in the face to face and he didn't talk about. He wouldn't talk to anybody for like 16 hours afterwards was probably hammered. He was hammered, man. Most likely he was hammered. Allegedly. Allegedly. Can you still sue? Even though it doesn't have a heart, it was like an artificial heart. She's still out of Su,

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       but he shot his friend in his face and his friend apologized. That's how fucking gangster Dick Cheney is. While his friend was like 60 walked it off when she walked in front of your bullets, Bro, they would probably live out of their fucking mind. Just that you want to talk about ptsd. Do you imagine the demons inside the brain of Dick Cheney, the, just knowing what he knows, could you imagine? I mean, if that guy has an ounce of self realization, an ounce of, of objectivity, of introspective thought, whereas really thinks about it than I do the right thing was I do think. Do you think, um, that um, weapons of mass destruction, you think that was cool? Was that okay? There's only a few hundred thousand dollars a million people died, but that it was probably for the best historically. I mean, they were going to die anyway. It's not like there are a million of mortals, right?

Speaker 3:          01:41:51       I mean, what you're asking about, do I think he was president? Dick Cheney seeks daily affirmation. Well, he's a biblical character in that right after he had done all these things right, but he'd clearly pulled the strings to get us into Iraq. And there's clearly financial motives. I mean, he was the god Damn Ceo of the company that got into no bid, billion dollar contract. Palpatine man, he's a damn sith Lord. Like Bush, like him or hate him. He thought he was doing the right thing. You know the guy believed, but this is the thing to undeniable biblical thing about him. So the guy has a ton of heart attacks, right? Yeah. They replaced his fucking heart. They replaced his valves with some machine and this machine constantly pump blood to the point where he didn't have a pulse. It was a constant flow. So if you put your finger on Dick Cheney while he had this artificial heart in place, he wouldn't have a pulse. Started vader. He's dark vader. He's fucking darth vader. Like the old man at the era, the promethium that was pretending to be dead and shit. You pull. Make sure that's true. I'm pretty sure I'm correct about that. Jamie. Pull that up about about Dick Cheney's heart being artificial and not having a pulse. Okay. Yeah. I was just reading about the actual event and how it happened and he shot him in the face and they blamed the guy waiting this name for walking in front of them.

Speaker 3:          01:43:21       Had a fucking idiot. Listen, man, you don't point your gun where people are. The guy didn't walk in front of you. That's crazy. As a person who fires guns, you don't ever point your gun anywhere near a person. If a person walks in front and you pull your gun away from where that person is, if you have to be aware of your left and your right at all times, you don't stand in front of somebody. The guy didn't just. It's not that guys fault bionic. Dick Cheney technically has no pulse here. It goes during recent heart surgery at doctors and planted a ventricular assist device to augment Cheney's failing ticker, but it also gives us critics and other punch line to work with because the device moves blood continuously. It doesn't mimic the pulsating rhythm of the heartbeat. Tactically speaking, Dick Cheney no longer has a pulse in insert darth vader comparisons here.

Speaker 3:          01:44:12       This is a 2010 and that's still kicking. That's amazing, man. I used to do this bit about Dick Cheney where you had one extra secret service agent, like every other guy had five, but he had six and this one, they put them on like this all vegetarian diet and they had to do jogging every day. He's like, why the fuck do I have to jog? And there was always a guy behind them with a a giant cooler filled with ice. And the moment Dick Cheney has a heart attack, they were going to take that dude out, cut his chest open, shove his heart inside a Dick Cheney and Save Dick Cheney was one extra secret service agent that was a sacrifice. He's a dark guy, man. He, he was the CEO of the company that profited the most from them blowing shit up in Iraq

Speaker 2:          01:44:59       rope around the time that I was in the navy, the uh, they had this reimplemented, this anthrax vaccination policy and it's a, I think they've done it in the first Gulf War Two and a lot of people think is directly responsible for the Gulf War syndrome and all those guys like dealing with chronic muscle spasms and fatigue. And really, um, so yeah, but like they, they came down the pipeline again. They're gonna, they're gonna make it a mandatory thing for everybody. And then I think in [inaudible] 98, they recalled it, I can't remember. [inaudible] 98 or 99 with the times and all these people had already kind of dug in and figured out that there was only one lab in the entire world authorized and regulated to manufacture the vaccine call. I think their lab was bioport up in Michigan and one of the owners of the lab was a former admiral of the navy and also in the joint chiefs of staff things. Last thing was crow and this guy. So you're telling me that dude didn't know that this contract is major bit multibillion dollar defense contract coming down the pipeline and then jumps in and buys this company, you know, to start pumping people with shit that they have no idea. And they actually got the lab got shut down while they're manufacturing all this stuff. Who knows how many hundreds of thousands of people had to put that shit in there

Speaker 3:          01:46:22       and they will fucking experiment on soldiers. They have done it in the past is the precedent has been set a long time go.

Speaker 2:          01:46:28       Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I remember bootcamp. You go down those cattle catalog and there's like six people and you just keep going through and you go through with all of these shots, guns that just. I have no idea to this day where a lot of it even was. Man, I got stationed overseas so we had to take a bunch of typhoid and there's a whole lot of shit on. They don't even tell you what they're putting in you, you know, for a week. You can't lift your arms up. Like

Speaker 4:          01:46:56       how fucked is that? They don't have. They don't have to tell you. No. That's crazy that they can just shoot vaccinations in you and they don't have to tell you what they're doing.

Speaker 2:          01:47:08       I refused to take them. They put you in prison really? Or the brick, you know, like a lot of guys. How long they put you in for until you get in new guys. I think it was like 90 days restricts it. Yeah. And then they don't know. I'll have to shoot you when he get out. No, no, no. It's not like that. It's just a, it's one of those. But I mean it was obviously about making money. Fuck or no, because I'm an anthro sale. Okay. So you get hit with weaponized anthrax or you've even if you've been vaccinated, it's a spore. It's a virus. It's going to mutate as soon as it hits the air. So, you know, I guess the argument of the reasoning was that it might make you live 30 or 40 extra seconds longer so you can hit the button to launch some more missiles at them. I don't know what the reasoning behind it was, but uh, yeah, a lot of it was a big deal. I remember when that story came out, they found out that the admiral owned the company was like, wait a what? So crazy. This is illegal. It's so crazy. I wonder if he took the shot, I doubt it. Wide

Speaker 4:          01:48:08       Gulf War Syndrome was uh, connected to depleted uranium. Maybe it was a several, several different factors, so many different factors because they know that they definitely used depleted uranium shells as anti tank weapons that's been proven and that was something that they were never supposed to use. And the half life on that shit is something like 100,000 years or something nutty. So there's these places in Iraq to this day that are just Foxville from these, these depleted uranium shells slamming into tanks and soldiers would take pieces from those tanks as memories, you know, they take them home as souvenirs and so you're carrying something that's highly radioactive, like those depleted uranium shells. It's laid literally nuclear waste and they use that as a shell and it just goes through everything. I mean, you're harnessing the power of the sun, the blow a hole through a jeep. And then these poor fuckers, you know, they, they stumble upon this jeep and nobody had told them shit and they're like, hey man, I take this license plate home. You shouldn't even be anywhere near that. You shouldn't even be a mile away from that fucking jeep. Meanwhile, they're hanging around that God damn thing.

Speaker 2:          01:49:26       Who knows, man, my grandfather was in the South Pacific during World War Two and even as an older man, he must have gotten something in his blood over there because it'd be like middle of July and he'd be sitting in the house with like long johns and corduroy pants and a flannel shirt on and talk about I'm cold, you know, she's just like. So I mean, there must have been cemented as nerve gas

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       or. Well, maybe even just tropical diseases. I talked to this, this um, guy. He's a, um, uh, an expert infectious diseases. His name is Peter Hotez. He's a, um, professor I think at the University of Houston. Um, but he's a specializes in diseases that people get in tropical climates. And he told me that when you look at a tropical environment, 100 percent of those people are infected with some sort of parasite, $100 silver built a resistance to it. Well, they just, they or not, or they're affected by it. Like we were talking about all sorts of different moisture born bacterial diseases that people get from dirty water and stuff that you just get from bugs and you get from the air and jungleman. You're basically living in a petri dish. Yup. You live in a nice shit's coming to life every day. I mean, if you think about the jungle, right?

Speaker 4:          01:50:49       If you go there and you see all that vegetation ever around you, it's just a life and crickets and bugs and snakes and spiders and cats at fucking sloths and eagles and real monkeys and shed. Whoa. Like there's so much life there that it's at a macro level too. It's at a micro level, like there's life that you're not going to see. It's going to get into your body, crawling up your asshole right now while you're swimming or you know, eat becomes a part of you. Like they, they have these parasites that become a part of you. A buddy of mine got tricky gnosis foul dude. Jesus. He got tricky gnosis from eating a bear meat that wasn't cooked that well. Actually it was on the show. His name is Steven. Ellie's a hosted the show called mediator and he was on the show with a bunch of other crew members.

Speaker 4:          01:51:35       They all eat this bear and they all didn't cook it. Well, they didn't cook it well enough and they were joking about getting trick and hostess at the time. So they all got trick analysis so they have these little tiny worms, these larva that are in their body forever growing. Well, they don't grow. They just stayed dormant in your body until someone comes along and say if you ate Steven Rinella and you didn't cook them to 160 degrees, you would get tricky gnosis from them. Like it's in him for just. Yeah, just part of the deal. And he said he was like really deathly sick for like seven days. Felt like shit. Like you had the flu in pain all the time is aching and pain and then it went away and then it just. You just deal with the fact that now you have a trick analysis.

Speaker 4:          01:52:18       But like in these tropical environments, there's tons of people that have all sorts of crazy parasites in their body, dysentery or malaria or any damn yeah. And in some parasites, they're just starting to now understand this parasites that affect behavior. Like there's some shit called toxoplasmosis. You heard of that one. The cat parents plasmosis get you fucking die from smelling bird shit, dude. One of the creepiest stories I've ever heard was guys in Africa, they were standing in front of a cave thing was Africa and they were standing in front of a cave and there were scientists and they wanted to photograph these birds fly. Are these bats rather flying out of the cave when they would go out at night because you know the bats leave caves and mass and there was millions of bats, literally millions of bats in this cave. And so they parked out in front of this cave, set up the calls and shit to shit on. That's what they didn't anticipate. All the flying out of the shit on. And they got deathly ill and they were dead within weeks. Both guys died. They died. This whole thing on tv about the dive viruses, which means they start bleeding on their fucking eyeballs.

Speaker 2:          01:53:27       That's what you get for going and looking at in bat caves, man. Well,

Speaker 4:          01:53:31       bring raincoats on some goggles. Yeah, man. You gotta don't eat it. Definitely don't eat it, but it gets in your skin like you can't have that shit on your skin. You can get sick just from it contacting your face a bat dirty bat shit. Shit's on your face. You could probably die. I'd want to. Yeah. Oh Man. There's so many parts of the world where there's so much life and that life is so much more dangerous. We're just so used to life being like, oh look at the squirrel. I love wildlife. Look at that bird. So cute.

Speaker 2:          01:54:07       But you always hear about these people like talking about going down to Ecuador and Peru to do. I asked him like, fuck that. I don't want to go through that damn jungle with those bugs and caterpillars and shit. Snakes crawling up my leg. They say that's part of the experience is going to the jungle, but yeah, you could do that in Malibu. You can do it in Malburg, man. You can just sit down in the house. I'll do the cliff notes. The cliff notes is DMT, man. I think going to the jungle probably be pretty bad ass. But you have running around. Yeah. Yeah. You have to have people that are awake with spotlights and guns. Yeah. You don't want to be that one dude that goes to South American. It's jacked by a leopard will just sleep in this tree. Jaguar. But Jaguar, Jaguar, Jaguar, South America, right.

Speaker 2:          01:54:59       Leopards. Uh, Africa, Asia. That sounds right. So yeah, man, this has been a national geographic podcasts. They oftentimes are. You knew a guy named Steve Mirrors. Mirrors Huy spelled last name. He's a British guy. He's like a naturalist in those. He's like A. Probably a master survival is put a, I think it's Mirror Steve. Look it up, Steven Mirrors, man. You should try to get him on the show sometimes. I used to, I used to sit and just watch hours of youtube videos. He's like one of these. You just tell her just like a beautiful human being, but he knows all about, um, it's like bear grylls and Mr Rogers, you know what I mean? But bind together, but a little more legit. Real bear grylls. Yeah. Bear grylls. Legit. Oh,

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       girls got compromised by Hollywood. Hollywood. Do you know why bear grylls got that show? I have no idea. Some inflammation drinking is piss. Nope. Les Stroud, survivor man did not want to fake anything. Less. Drought did all his own shit. He went by himself. He put himself in dangerous situations. He lost tons of weight on camera, whereas literally starving to death, he documented the entire thing in 100 percent by himself. Encounters with wild animals, like really dangerous situations. Almost starving to death, almost freezing to death, having to make fire on your own and going there with a very limited amount of things to keep. Like you would go there with like a pocket knife. You'll allow themselves some string that he could go fishing with go and he would stay for seven days and have a dropoff point where they would drop them off and then it pick up point and if he didn't go to the pickup point and they didn't have to go looking for them, but they wanted to fake stuff and bear bear grylls filled that gap because les whitten fake anything.

Speaker 3:          01:56:39       It's like, no, we not bringing a camera crew because then it's not me by myself that you lose all of what makes the show special. So what he did is just a bunch of things that they set up. Like if I found these sheep, I could take it and make a coat. You know, like the shit they put the sheep there, they killed the sheep, they did it for them. I keep doing all these stunts, like jumping from tree to tree and unnecessarily hanging out with hippo is this guy. No Steve Black Shawl. I can't find a Steve Bowles's last name. Ray mears premier's just guys hanging out with hippos because that guy's saying ray mears, gangs for. There's a show called Carter's war and it's this show about this guy who is an anti anti poaching official in Africa and he tries to prevent them from poaching all these animals.

Speaker 3:          01:57:35       A lot of it is for the Asian market, for Rhino Horn and a bunch of these different animals that they want like ivory and Rhino Horn is a big one though. They keep finding these rhinos murdered with their horns, hacked off. It's a fucking sobering show, man, for two reasons. One, because you see what people are willing to do. These animals just shoot them in the head and cut their horns off and cut half their face off like a chainsaw and shit. It's crazy. And then also you see how fucking poor these people are and then you realize like they of course they're going to do that. Like if they can shoot that rhino and make $50,000 from its magic corn or whatever the fuck they make, they probably make 50 bucks, you know? But if they can make that, it's between them starving and not starving. Like that's literally what you're looking at. Everything subjective. Just the gentlemen that's him shows called Bushcraft, those crafts hanging out with a wolf. Look at this motherfucker. He knows the wolves. He's like, he's like the most unassuming guy, but he's so bad ass dude. It's called bushcraft. Bushcraft. Is it an English show or an

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       Australia on the BBC I believe. Oh Man.

Speaker 8:          01:58:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:58:48       Doodle. Just walk out in the woods with nothing but a damn or there. Is there a fish

Speaker 1:          01:58:56       with like some piece of meat or something they got. Yeah. These guys that are into like surviving on their own like that. They take great pleasure with that. They're always fascinating. I guess he's really naturalist to like Fanta and natural vegetation and finding forging food on your own that contains a lot more useful information than just, okay, you got three days, drink your pis and don't get eaten by the alligator. Like no man will. Survivor man came up, came up with all that on his own. His concept, because he was actually living in the forest with his pregnant wife. The two of them, they are by themselves. When he was a younger man, like he did this on his own before, you know, before he was famous, like he's been doing this forever. What's his background? Where do you learn it all? He just, I don't know, man.

Speaker 1:          01:59:44       That's a good question. He told me I forgot. I think he just learned to read a lot of suffering for those 30 minutes of viewing entertainment. He's got this wacky thing he's doing now and always looking for bigfoot. He's got a survivor man. Big Foot is like the biggest thing since sliced bread. Leavenworth Washington. That's where he is. Do you see him? Yeah, so when we got a cup of coffee on the road one day, this lady had a whole photo album full of pictures of bigfoot in her backyard. It looked like some bullshit, like our neighbor jacket off.

Speaker 1:          02:00:19       She's selling coffee though. I talked to One lady when I was doing this, a Scifi show. We did a whole episode on bigfoot one lady that I really believe saw something a really believe she did, but what I think she probably saw was a black bear because black players walk on their hind legs. Um, there's video of black bears walk in like 100 yards from her. She was very earnest and what she was talking about and was sensational in any, in any way at all. What she was telling me, it was pretty, pretty straightforward. And I also believe her because there's black bears in that area. It's incredibly densely wooded. Like the area that she's talking about was the Pacific northwest. Oh yeah man. I guess Mount Rainier, Mt. Rainier. That's right outside of Washington, right outside of Seattle. It's gorgeous. Big Harry fucked her is real. That's the only place he could possibly exist because you could absolutely disappeared in that forest. Yup. That's some dense, dense wilderness and filled with food filled with food filled with wildly known me saying, I believe in bigfoot. Yeah. You're, you're 100 percent correct though. If there was an animal like that, that would be the spot. It also would be the spot because that's the spot where it would make sense geographically. My feeling is what I believe. I bet

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       it used to be real because at one point in time there was a thing called gigantic pithy kiss that lived in Asia. It was as recently as 100,000 years ago, which is not that long and that was when the bering strait was connected, so Asia and the United States, you could actually walk from Asia to the United States that the land mass was in place and the ice age and was all frozen over. So during that time it would have been entirely possible because so many native American cultures have names for that animal to have names for this. Like man that lives in the forest is how's the same legend on the other side of the world about some crazy well, and it was real. Right? And then also on top of that thing being real. They also know that there was those little hobbit people in the island of Flores and there's a theory about that thing is that it's either the most recent one.

Speaker 4:          02:02:31       They think that it might've been as recently as 50,000 years ago, but I think they thought it was like 14,000 years ago until recently. Look at this. That's a bear dude. That is a bear. Look at that. That's a real legit black bear. So imagine if you saw that for sure. That's big fish. So that last little. See when bears hurt there Paul. Like if they get bitten in there, Paul and their pod gets infected. They can walk on their back legs and they can do it for hundreds of yards. So I think she saw that just when you thought they couldn't get any scarier. There's a bunch of videos of bear's doing that. It's not just that one bear. So there's a lot of evidence that bears walk like that. So this one lady that I talked to, I bet she saw a black bear that was walking on time.

Speaker 4:          02:03:15       Legs. That's what. I bet. It only makes sense. You can't see anything in there. Anyway, that's the thing about those woods. You lived up there right in the car for a minute. Yeah. You can't see shit in those woods. No. We used to go. Just look a little weird Swiss mountain ski town called Living Worth. I don't know, a buddy of mine. We drove through on our way to Vancouver to go party and there was another, it was like farther east, I think it was like, you know, in the middle of nothing man, just trees. You could, you could just walk off into it and disappear. Well less. When he was camping, he was doing an episode of survivor and it was up in Alaska and he says that he heard some noise outside of his tent and he barely moved. Like he didn't, he didn't want to move. We wanted to see if he could get his camera and uh, try to record this and he heard something that sounded like a primate, something like made like some primate type noise. And then when he went to open up his tent and look outside, the thing took off, took off running. And he said it sounded like bipedal footprints. I go large, heavy, bipedal thing. The problem is I've heard bears make that kind of sound. I've heard them personally, seen them with my eyes fighting with each other. They they make like

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       a almost like a gorilla and they're attacking each other and they were making this crazy noise. It was a mother trying to keep a male bear away from her cubs. And she was. They fought. They fought right in front of us, like within a hundred yards. I watched him duke it out, UFC style Alberta. I was watching it go down. So I've heard bears make like a monkey sound that makes much more practical sense to me than a seven foot tall chewbacca that no one's ever seemed to be able to play. Eyes are more hands on, you know? Well we got drones now, man. I wanted to believe so bad. That's why the one thing I want to believe in bigfoot almost as much as aliens as Ufo reports, aliens and Ufo is like the one that's the one two punch for what you want to believe in, man. Yeah. Other than love. Well that too.

Speaker 1:          02:05:41       I don't know. We don't want to go down that rabbit hole. Yeah, black holes and infinite multi versus. Well, I, I, without a doubt, you go to school out there that were the. Yeah. I guess the question is why would they fucking care? Well, or maybe they do. I mean, maybe this is pretty interesting. I'd watch it for sure. I mean, come on, man. We studied turtles. You know, dudes traveled to the jungle to study of fucking butterfly. Some heavy stuff going on the back of a turtle. Joe Rogan. That's true. Not to demean turtles. Look, if turtles were on the moon, oh my God, we'd be flying jets to, to visit the oldest known species on earth day crocodiles. Really? Whoa. Yeah. Turtles been around longer than any other living creature on the planet. They're like, um, nail clippers. They never had to make them any better.

Speaker 1:          02:06:31       That's perfect design. Yeah. Like when I was a kid, nail clippers are exactly the same. They haven't done anything. I mean, they made better can openers. They've made a better tupperware. They've improved almost every aspect. I guess steak knives are pretty much the same. Even even the number of, uh, like the, the, the Shill, you know, the, the, you know, like the symmetrical patterns of the shoulders. 13, no matter how big are they are small. So like all Indians believe that that coincided with the 13 lunar cycles of the moon. Yeah. I made a whole album cover all about this shit. I was just letting you know, the guys like how weird can we get with this thing? Just make the tackiest record cover ever day are a very fascinating creature. I mean anytime you see patterns like even like a Nautilus Shell, see these patterns, these repeating patterns that the animals have. Like, you know, okay, well why is there as some sort of a geometric pattern into this animal's design? You know, almost fractal. Really? Oh, it is. It's. Well, it's a FIBONACCI

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       sequence. The FIBONACCI sequence manifests itself in like sunflowers. Like they say, like if you look at a pine cone on the FIBONACCI sequences in a pine cone, meaning that it's a sequence of numbers like zero. And then there's one and then there's. And then there's two and one plus two. There's three and three plus two is five, and the five plus three is eight and it keeps going on and on and on, and it's this exponential equation and when you're adding all those things up, that same sequence can be found in the shape of people's faces and honeycombs and a bunch of different designs like pine cones. There's very. See Jamie's got some stuff. They pull up a bit. The FIBONACCI numbers in nature. There's this crazy green fruit that's always at my, uh, might be a vegetable. That's it. What is that fucking thing that fruit?

Speaker 3:          02:08:26       Broccoli? What does it. Romanesque Broccoli, romanesque Broccoli. It's like the DMT fruit, like when you look at that, like that is fractal geometry in fruit form or in vegetable form or other really weird. But that's the FIBONACCI sequence. Like if you go to the very top and you see how small it is and then it as it tapers down, it gets larger and the numbers all exponentially increased. It's just so fascinating. Tool. Yeah. Was of a music. The band when I was younger, do you know that? Uh, maynard key is going to fight Ronda Rousey and an MMA match. Did Not know that. Knew He. When he loses, he's getting an exchange. You're bullshitting me. Of course. I am trying to help spread a rumor. Awesome. I'll show you some pictures afterwards. He does. Is he like a Jujitsu Guy? I believe he's got his purple belt. I'm pretty sure he goes about, but he's very dedicated. He's so dedicated. You got a hip replacement and went back to training. But here it goes. Five Rhonda Rogers Kit that look at it. Awesome. He's a fucking

Speaker 2:          02:09:35       character. I love that dude. Ever him? Oh yeah. Hung out with them. Really cool. He's been on the show a couple times. He's a good dude. Was one of my lyricist, man. Yeah, a really. When I lived out there and he was a little kinds of music I just discovered that I probably never would have gotten into otherwise. And that band I really like had a little phase lyrically speaking. I thought it was some of the more Cathartic and kind of start donek stuff I've ever heard. Really intelligent way of saying things. I just never metal guy,

Speaker 3:          02:10:04       he's almost too smart for his own good. He's one of those guys when he talked to me like this, you, you might be just in your own way all the time. So it's one of the reasons why thank. He decided to start a wine business out of in the middle of nowhere just. And his wine is fucking excellent. I don't know if you're a wine person if you like wine, but caduceus wine. I just know what I like and I love it. It's great. He has a bunch of different kinds of ones, but uh, he's, he's a legit wizard when it comes to winemaking. He really knows his shit inside and out. It's not like some sort of a thing that he leaned, lends his name to, you know, like fucking orson wells. We will sell no wine before it's time. No, he, this is his wine company, like he has created it and he's also like figured out a way to cultivate grapes and it's very weird spot in Arizona. Well, I don't think anybody was doing it before him, so he had to start the thing from scratch. He did the whole thing for years. Doing it for years. He's nuts, man. We've had some long ass conversations about it.

Speaker 3:          02:11:08       Yeah, he's one of the coolest people that I talked to at the time.

Speaker 2:          02:11:11       That's Ballsy, man, because you don't. I might be wrong, but I think you have to bring in a couple harvest and then you won't even know if the grapes are going to be any good. That's a good spot for it. So you're putting all this money up.

Speaker 3:          02:11:24       Well, you have to analyze the soil and you have to know what you're doing as far as fertilizing it and all those all. There's so many factors involved and how to. I mean it's an art. It's a crazy art that you'd wind up eating. You wind up drinking at the very end of it, but creating the taste. It's like the expression of the art instead of an audible thing, like a song. It becomes a palette thing, but it's a very much like the way he creates music. He creates this wine and it's a form of art. It's like a mass produce, not mass produced, you know, like Coca Cola, but it's making more than one bottle. He's got several acres and he creates this art and you experienced that art instead of listening to a CD. Experiencing that art when you drink is one very fascinating guy, man.

Speaker 2:          02:12:12       They just played in Nashville not long ago. It was on tour or I probably would have gone, but yeah, I'd say top five shows of all time. Wildlife tools. Probably at least two of those spots. Really? Yeah, Dude. Wow. Yeah, a lot. I mean it's just, they're so incredibly tight glove just aesthetically in the presentation and it's sent, you know, most like big, loud metal shows. It's just as well.

Speaker 3:          02:12:33       Right, right. It was, it was pristine, like sound wise and the drummers of machine. Yeah. Dana Carey. I wouldn't put them in a metal category. Maybe I'd be, I don't know

Speaker 2:          02:12:45       what you'd call it. It's, it was so unique. I don't remember hearing it even. I'm thinking that's very, uh, some complex shit going on, man.

Speaker 3:          02:12:58       Yeah. We're talking about like motivating songs that, that riff in that song. Prison sex. No, the beginning down, down, down, down, down. When you're lifting weights and that comes on, you can lift more weights, man. You can lift more weights. You feel stronger. You like if you're tired, you don't on the elliptical machine that comes on you like you could fucking push through. I mean it does something to your body. It energizes you. Like that's a real feeling that you get. We don't think of it as a real feeling because he can't put it on a scale for visceral music. Something's happening to you when you listened to a jam. That's

Speaker 2:          02:13:35       correct. Oh, I mean, I, I, you know, you hate to think about though, and those guys actually experimented with frequencies and a lot of those deep down pitch tunings and time signatures are varies. Very, very, very eastern melodion time signatures that they're alternating in the, off down. It's, it's heavy shit, heavy, heavy, like they put thought into that music. Well, the one song that they orchestrated to that, you can totally manipulate human emotions with tones and keys and vibration as well. Have you ever fucked around with binaural beats? I mean, not for fun or like on record either for fun.

Speaker 3:          02:14:12       I haven't done it either way, but I know that it's real. I mean I know that people swear by it. It affects your brainwaves.

Speaker 2:          02:14:20       There's a reason all these trials throughout history, out in the middle of nowhere or banging on drums will know when they're doing their thing. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:14:26       Oh Man. There's a ICAROS. You've got all those. I don't know how they say that. You play when you do dmt and the DMT entities danced to the ICO. Rose. I mean like it's a part of the thing, like when you do them together then you understand. If you listen to the music independently, like fucking weird music. It's kind of trippy, but it's weird. I think this is meant for people. That hundred percent. Yeah. Yeah. Well this is created by a shaman. This, this the one that I have on my phone that I play is created by a shaman. It's by this guy. Let me see if I was homeboy's name here. I think his name is actually on the um, on the recording itself.

Speaker 2:          02:15:15       God Damn it. I don't have it on this. I was going to say that you think it's meant. I mean other than the people who are naturally from those areas where these things grow out of the ground and occur and they use them to connect with on a religious level, their spirit animals and things they believe in, but you like the tourists going down there and drinking that shit.

Speaker 8:          02:15:34       Uh,

Speaker 2:          02:15:36       how do you feel about that?

Speaker 3:          02:15:37       Well, it's like everything else. You're going to get legit ones and then you're going to get people that realize there's a lot of money in tourists coming out here and taking this wacky shared. And so they figured out how to make it. So you're going to get people that are taking advantage of people. You got to get people that are doing all sorts of negative shit and then you're going to get legit Shaman people that are legitimately involved in the spiritual quest of attaining enlightenment and reaching a neighboring dimension, like they really believe that they're reaching a neighboring dimension that they're tapping into something that's around us all the time, but then we don't have access to in a normal state of consciousness. And it's a well of souls who tapping into. It's something. I mean, it's real easy to dismiss, especially for someone never experienced it. It's

Speaker 4:          02:16:29       really easy to dismiss and say it's all in your imagination, but for someone who has experienced it, it's very difficult to accept. And it's very difficult for you to say that you know, for sure that it's all your imagination if you haven't experienced it. I see. It's a very, I appreciate from a, from a, um, uh, an intelligence standpoint, someone's perspective on it that hasn't experienced it. But the reality is, until you know what you're talking, until you've actually gone into that thing and know how titanic, the alien it is, you really just saying things, you're just making noises with your mouth and you know what? There's no way you could know. It's not like it's, well, I had a dream once and it was kind of saying, no, no, no, it's. You're not there anymore. You go to a different place. You experience a different reality.

Speaker 4:          02:17:19       More real than what we normally interpret it as reality. That's the most fucked up part about it is it's so much crisper and more vibrant and brighter, and then reality itself seems muted in some odd way. It's almost like we're, we're, we're, we're like having sex with a condom on, you know, and a big thick fucking trash bag, condom. And when you pass through to whatever the fuck this other dimension is that filter the, the, the frosted window is removed and you could see it all the fog is gone, the clouds are gone and you just boom, gets shot through a cannon to the middle of reality. And that middle of reality of some strange geometric living environment where there's no, um, there's no three dimensional objects in it that aren't touching each other. Everything is connected to everything else. Like there's a bunch of different things.

Speaker 4:          02:18:12       They're constantly alternating all the time, but there's no space between anything. There's no space between you and me. Not In that world. It doesn't exist. There's no space. Everything is. Everything is all together. It's all together. And you feel altogether like for the first time ever, you don't feel like you're sitting in Canoga Park in a chair with a roof over your head and above that roof of the sky and above the skies the moon. You don't feel that when you're in this, you feel like you feel down infinite. You feel to the left and to the right, infinite. You feel above. But you also feel like you're in a room and it feels fractal and it's, oh, it's fucking crazy. So, I mean, it might all be in your imagination, but my take on it has always been, even if it is, even if you're not going to a well of souls and experiencing God and experiencing purity and wisdom, it's the same exact experience as if you were so. Even if it is in your imagination, your imagination has pretty cool. Fucking amazing. I mean it might, it might be. That's what you're experiencing it. It very well might be. It's you don't know, and there's no way to tell. It's easy to be cynical. It's easy to be dismissive. It's easy to say, oh, come on,

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       he's fucking hippies. They think they're experiencing God through some powder that they smoke in a way to go meet head. Yeah. Yeah. You really are. It's a really. I mean, it's cute. It's fun to do. It's easy to dismiss it, but once you do it, there's no dismissing it. When you're there, there's no dismissing it. There's no easy explanation. There's no easy anything. Once you're there, once you're in there, you better let go. Bitch. You better go. You better not try to fucking wrap your head around this, just breathe and try not to freak out. And with that note, ladies and gentlemen, what are you doing in town? Man?

Speaker 2:          02:20:01       I got to do A. I gotta. I gotta do anything. We are getting ready to put a record out and tomorrow we're taping a live show for radio station and then Wednesday we're taping a song for Conan. Oh beautiful. And then so just a little quick, quick trip out, get to get to finally get the new band at a rehearsal space and see what's going on though. I'm excited.

Speaker 3:          02:20:25       Nice. That's fun. Last time I went with you to Conan, I never. Yeah, it was fun man.

Speaker 2:          02:20:32       You know those tv things as they go. It's always a strange dynamic, you know, even even for performance because you get there and you do it and you wait and you do it again for tv and you know and you need to do it and you wait. You wait and wait. But if all of the ones that we played, I think that one, and maybe it's just because it's in California, where there's a far more mellow, laid back vibe. I think Cohen has a really nice studio spaces bigger, louder than New York. Was it still fun with her older, more tight buildings and the union crews are on it, you know, they're running a crack tight, um, which may be a better thing to keep your adrenaline up. Oh yeah. We sat around all day and then at 4:30 like, okay, you're on a two minutes, you know, by the way millions of people are going to watch this. Like, so when is this going to be on a that I'm not sure we're taping it because we're out here for the other thing as opposed to waiting until the fall when we're actually her on tour. So it was bringing everybody out and we've done it twice. But yeah, him and Andy, they'd been great to us, man.

Speaker 3:          02:21:26       No, they're awesome man. He's a great guy. He's a well known, nice guy. Really. Can you tell? He's doing a show, sees a genuine music lover to listen. Man has always been fun. We've got to do this more often. Fuck and startle Sampson. Apparently. I'll be coming here every once in a while. Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back tomorrow with Kevin rose. See you that later.

Speaker 8:          02:21:52       Oh yeah.
