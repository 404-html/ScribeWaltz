Speaker 1:          00:00:02       The joe rogan experience podcast is brought to you by several uncomfortable things. The first one to talk about when the strange people that you don't know. Steve Ronell's here, I don't even know this dude, hardly I and an end. I enjoy your show and I'm going to have to talk about fake vaginas because that's one of our sponsors. One of our sponsors is the flashlight, the number one sex toy for men. We've heard it was a really close race, but we don't know who number two is. You go to Joe rogan.net. Click on the link for the flashlight and you know, I know what you're saying. Dab My life. Yeah. Number two was a melon. Say, I don't need that in my life. I don't know. I'm not in a perverted person, amount of wicked person, but you will masturbate. You know you will. You should masturbate. You know why? Because life is complicated and the way the human body's designed, we're supposed to be breeding at every possible chance because infant mortality was so high because people getting eaten by fucking Jaguars. Okay. And that's not the world we live in today. So in order to navigate through this world, you've got to navigate with a body that essentially has the same DNA as those crazy monkey people, dodge and Jaguars from 10,000 years ago. But that's not you anymore. Okay. You live in a complicated society and you're going to masturbate. So go.

Speaker 2:          00:01:14       I think the number one sex toy is proudly the blowup doll. Wouldn't you say that's, what do you think? What else? No, I mean number one. Number two, I mean, what else would people buy it be a product that we don't know about? I've seen a bunch of like similar items. I mean, it's not rocket science. Gang gets alone, something soft to shoot loads into. It's not that complicated. Vaseline,

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       something along those lines. Anyway, go to Joe Rogan. Dot. And then click on the link for the fleshlight entering the code name, Rogan, and you will get 15% off. There you go. And it comes in a brown paper thing. You don't know what the fuck it is. You don't have to feel it

Speaker 2:          00:01:46       barest. Hey, are you allowed to say how much more do these runs? I thought, I don't know how much they run. I don't know. We get, we don't get, we get 'em for free. I think it's actually, it's less than 169 bucks. I think I would say $100. Even at when you're paying $100, she's, you're filming like a creep. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:02       No matter what. It's a, it's a stigma that unfortunately is stuck in our head that masturbation is somehow another evil and paying for something, buying something and then fucking it. And that's, no, nobody's, nobody's proud of that. So it's going to be stigmatized

Speaker 2:          00:02:15       no matter what. Well, you know, as an example, this just look at a price. I think we should price it with, go ahead. Tell him how much, uh, before that beautiful coupon code that you have, you can get Susie diamonds, vagina for $67 and 96 cents. Now I don't know if the quality of the girl changes for the flashlight. Would you say like Jim and Jim said different girls? I'm like, if it was only as tight as their actual vagina. Oh right. I'm sure that's what they do cause they mold is no one the inside. It's got to be a standard core. I think it's just the outside. Well, each girl has a different texture inside. I know that like Hayes, you know she's got a swirl. Special blood.

Speaker 1:          00:02:54       Steven now second guessing why you should have come on this fucking podcast. It wait until 10:00 PM this thing started.

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       There's this hot girl. I've never seen her before, but her name's Ariel on the fleshlight sheet. She has her flashlight. She is beautiful.

Speaker 3:          00:03:06       Do. There's a billion porno stars now. There's no way. They never stopped making them and they never retire. There's no end there. The rats on a sinking ship. Anyway, if you go to [inaudible] dot com that is our other sponsor, o n n I t, makers of shroom tech sport. This is the quarter seps mushrooms and beef 12 supplemented a, I know so many people that are on to that now and been raving about it. It's great for people that are like really into endurance work. If you're doing crossfit class or taking Jujitsu or something like that, it's an excellent endurance supplement. Uh, if you're just hanging around like Brian, there's no need for it.

Speaker 2:          00:03:42       Brian, no benefit. I've used the shroom tech is any of it. I feel like I don't want to fuck anything up. You don't want it to like people, I don't want people to think that I'm the, you're on the roids right. And I,

Speaker 3:          00:03:56       um, there's another, let's just leave that right there. There's another troop technical, the shroom tech immune. And the way it's been explained to me is this one is a really fascinating one that's great for your immune system because your immune system anticipates that this live organism is mushroom, has been eaten by the body and for whatever reason interprets it as a bug, interprets it as a cold so it fires up your immune system for attack that never comes. So, uh, it's a really interesting supplement just for your immune system, which in these terrible times of colds, especially when you're traveling, right? Brian pump up your immune system. We're also a makers of new mood, which is a five HTP. And L tryptofan supplement that is a serotonin booster gives you a nice little boost, makes people feel very happy. And uh, you know, I have friends that are on the five HTP and they were also taking antidepressants and their doctors told them literally Neil Brown, his doctor told them to stop taking the five HTP because it's basically like you're taking two antidepressants.

Speaker 3:          00:04:51       Isn't that nuts? The doctor would tell you, stop taking this nutritional supplement. It's a supplement that's available everywhere at fucking Gnc, at cvs pharmacy. It's available everywhere. It's so you just buy it. Stop taking that and get this crazy prescription shit that rewires your dome. Get this pill that lets you except your mundane reality and not be depressed. Sometimes you should be fucking depressed. All right. I know there's people out there that are unbalanced, but there's people out there depressed simply because of the environment that they exist. And on a daily basis, the stimulation over and over against sucks. And this pill's not going to help that and just tell you right now you've got to get your shit together.

Speaker 2:          00:05:27       Should we talked about last week, by the way? I got an answer. There was a contamination in Japan. Wow. Wow. Back. But that's not related to the nuclear contamination. No, I didn't. I don't think so. I think that's carrying the fuck out of me. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:05:41       we've got to get to that. We'll talk to that Steve. Or ready to live in the woods. Do it. He's prepared. This is mother fucker can survive out there. Um, we also make Alpha brain at [inaudible] dot com Alpha brain is the controversial yet effective cognitive enhancing supplement, as always, with all on it products. The number one concern is that you don't feel like you're getting ripped off. So here's how we make it as easy as possible. First of all, if you buy it and you don't like, it's a hundred percent money back guarantee, you don't even have to return the product. If you buy it and you don't like it, just tell us and you get your money back. So that simple. And then on top of that, I encourage you, first of all, before you ever take any sort of a nootropic, essentially vitamins and nutrients that aid your brain function.

Speaker 3:          00:06:26       Just go Google it. Go. It's so easy to do. It's free. Go Google. Read all the different studies, draw your own conclusions. There's a bunch of different proprietary blends other than ours that are available. And I've tried a couple. If I tried neuro one, I really liked that. That set a football player. What does that guy's name, the big Roman [inaudible] I think. I believe it's his, cause he's a guy's a had some issues with concussions and stuff like that. So He created this, uh, this nutrient rich stuff for your brain. Gay. I encourage people to try that. Try to steal our recipe by the stuff in bulk and copy it. I am way more concerned with you not feeling ripped off then you buying any of our shit. But if you do want to buy our shit, it's at [inaudible] dot com o n n I t use the code named Rogan and you'll get 10% off. All right, that's it. Let's get fucking crazy. Steve Ronell's here. We're going to break shit down. We're going to figure out how to eat or on animals. My head's really now, but all the supplements I can be carried trying my day. Joe Rogan podcast all day.

Speaker 3:          00:07:30       Do you take any supplements or you just out there and fucking eaten game every day?

Speaker 4:          00:07:34       I really don't, but you know, I do cause I mean I drink coffee half the day and then stop for a minute and then at night I'll tend to have a few drinks or a couple, you know, depending. So I guess in all, you know, I'm constantly feeling that I'm feeling this way and I wish I was feeling more of that way. Like more awake or more tired. Well the coffee's not going to help, boy, when you know it does it. Cause I'd take that, I'd take that and I take that for a nap.

Speaker 3:          00:08:00       This guy on Daniel Bolelli and he had the smartest thing to say about coffee. He said, I use it like a hard drug. He goes, I don't take it. But then when I have to take it when I'm really tired and I needed like the stamp to write a paper or something and he was like, then I take it, boom. I'm just wired, whereas I got to a point where I could drink a cup of coffee and just go to sleep.

Speaker 4:          00:08:17       Oh, for sure. And you could do that, right? Yeah. But it wasn't like that at a time, you know? Now it just seems like kind of honestly, it seems like a hot, smelly drink. No, I don't know. I'm always like, for instance, before doing this, I was like, I should go get a cup of coffee. Yeah, me too. I haven't looked for a Starbucks. If I have access to it, I want it all the time. If I'm out, like if we're on the field and, or I'm camping or something, I might make a little thing of instant coffee in the morning and never think of it the rest of the day. But it just has to do with, I don't know, man of force of habit. Yeah. I almost hate it. I almost hate it about myself, but no, I don't take as far as any actual supplements go, I don't, I tend to be a skeptic about things that no, no, I don't.

Speaker 3:          00:08:59       Hmm. Well, uh, I was a skeptic about vitamins and supplements and start toy. I looked into them and also I looked into the fact that the government's been trying to restrict him for a long time. They were going to make them available only through prescriptions. Then we got to call them nutriceuticals. It was some deal that they were with pharmaceutical companies because pharmaceutical company is going, so that fucking money we can be making boys. What's going on? Capitol Hill Hook us up. We're getting you an office. What's up? So they came up with this ridiculous idea that they were gonna make vitamins available. Only imagine if you had to go to a fucking doctor to get a multivitamin. How pissed he would be. Like, it's just nonsense. Just more regulations, more big business. You fuck heads, you get a prescription for carriers. But there's a, there's real science behind vitamins. There's a real science behind the, uh, the, the, all the work that's been done to figure out like, which vitamins enhance, which, you know, what's good for vision, what's good for muscular endurance. So, you know, what gives you energy be 12. Why is that? Let's find out. I mean, there's supplements are real. They're legit. You know, B 12 is a fabulous energy supplement. It's in everything. People take it. I know people had taken shots. They go to a place every week at clinic and get a beat. 12 shot.

Speaker 4:          00:10:04       It's been 12 the one that only comes through animal protein, animal protein, but animal products in some way. I do believe that's it. I remember guys saying that lecture, let me, let's, let's, let's find that out. Because people would say, people would say that you can't be vegetarian because be 12 I remember reading, I think it was B 12 that you get enough B12 from insect contamination. Holy Shit. On produce to stay alive.

Speaker 3:          00:10:28       Yeah. B12 only in animal foods. President only in animal foods.

Speaker 4:          00:10:32       Like if you don't like wash every single fold and a cabbage leaf, you're going to get 12

Speaker 3:          00:10:37       yeah. I saw some fucking crazy statistic online to the, the pounds of bugs, bug parts that a human being and living in a city will eat over the course of their life. It's mind boggling. It's like several pounds like bag.

Speaker 4:          00:10:51       Oh Helen's of bug parts. If you eat out of my garden at my house. I mean it's, it's almost kind of ridiculous but I don't even like eat around it so much anymore. You know when I watched your show, the wild with it, I thought it was really interesting that you live in the city, you live in it like you were living in Brooklyn, right. And yet you were doing the show when you're out in the fucking woods. Like if you know how cool it is out there, why would you want to live in Brooklyn? I when, when I met, it's oddly my first date with my wife was a four day date here in Los Angeles. At the time I was living in Alaska and even when I asked her out, I had to call her on a satellite phone from the north slope of, of the Brooks range where I was and she was in New York and I asked her, oh cause I had met her through work, through book publishing.

Speaker 4:          00:11:36       So we started dating, we had our four day date. I went back to Alaska and I made a bet there with a guy named Matt Carlson. I said, I bet you a hundred bucks, I'll marry that girl. And he called bullshit on that and I want to win the bet. But I think that largely just to win that bet, um, to win that hunter barks, you know, I want up getting married and moving in with my wife. That was like a big part of your motivation. Real. It ain't no, no, no, I'm joking. But yeah, so she, she works in book publishing and we met that way. I'm gone now maybe half the time, but yeah, I spend half my time there.

Speaker 5:          00:12:17       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:12:18       It's complete living there. I grew up in Michigan and lived in Montana for 10 years, but living in New York has changed everything. I thought I knew, you know, and I realized in a big way. Um, I tend to think kind of whatever, everyone around me doesn't think. So when I lived in Montana, I attended, I would find myself having views on things that would skew leftward cause I was responding to a strong, right. You have like a natural contrarian. So now being in New York has made me, I'm a lot, I'm kind of, if you picture like an old man who fought and you know, World War Two and like yelled at kids who come on his yard, I'm kind of becoming like that from being there. It's had such a profound effect on me, you know, cause I had, I not good. Right? No, I like it. I enjoy it. I like you like to come with that guy. You know what? Because it's such a fresh perspective. Every day I wake up and I see the world in a new way. I see it through the eyes of a mean old man. Oh that's hilarious. So, but no, we're there now and I can't at all complaining. It's the thing that people bring up most off. Like how can you live there? Um,

Speaker 4:          00:13:33       I go out now and I still have great friends and contacts and then you know, wild places and we'd go and hang out and do wild stuff and I'll pack up a cooler full of whatever we've been chasing, game meat. And I go back to my house and I have a very pleasant existence there. We have a young boy, it's just fun and it and it feels more like, um,

Speaker 5:          00:13:55       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:13:55       Kind of like emerge, you know, like, like going out into the wild woolly then like kind of coming back and decompressing. If I didn't, if I wasn't involved in the line of work where I would travel so much time and get to see such great wilderness areas and do such cool stuff, it would, it would bother me more. But you can buy travel so much. Yeah, it's just, it's fun and cool. If I, if I wasn't doing what I'm doing now, I would probably have to, I would probably have to split, you know, I'd probably wouldn't be able to go there, but in a way I'll always like when I'm long gone from there, I'll always look back at being in New York as very educational because when you look, I think all of this all the time, like, like grown where I grew up in semi-rural, Michigan or live in places, it's hard to drive down the road and imagine all the things that drive like global enterprise and global politics.

Speaker 4:          00:14:49       Cause you Kinda, you can't really out who around me would care enough about these things to make these happen. Like for instance, like I can't drive down a road in Michigan and be like, Oh that's why we're, that's why we invaded Iraq. You know what mean? It's like, right, you don't see, you know where things are going. But in New York you kind of go like, oh that's why, that's that way. That's why the movies that get made are, that's why they get made or that's why what's on TV is on TV or that's why the books I read are the books I read cause these are the people that you know are doing all this and it gives, it just like helps me more understand why America kind of looks like American as much as people

Speaker 5:          00:15:32       yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:15:33       In the U s tend to want to look at like, like New York or la as being this like weird otherness in a big way. I just find that it's more, it's more of an accurate portrayal of, of culture than you'd ever think because that's where so much culture is getting produced. And I never really picked up on this living in other places. I don't know if I'm making any sense.

Speaker 3:          00:15:53       You're totally making sense. Brian. Is there something wrong with this mic? It keeps, it's like it dropped off. Something happened. It's just if you're really loud. Oh, it's a got a regulator on it. Yeah. You got some new crafty technology going on here. No, it's been on there for awhile. You're making complete total sense. Um, I, you know, I always say that humanity is what it is at its potential. What is potential best or potential worst and the, what you see in New York is how, I mean there's some, there's a community to New York for sure. You know, there's definitely a closeness to the people there and you, you really, there was really accentuated after nine 11. I remember I went to New York really shortly after nine 11 and everybody was like really friendly and it was like really a profound difference from the way people were communicating with each other when I, when I lived there at one point in time.

Speaker 3:          00:16:39       And I think it's because just naturally human beings are not designed to live like that. That is just an alien form of tribe. That's ridiculous. Did the amount of input that comes into a person on a daily basis is way more than the body is designed for and we're just assuming that we can take it and it shows time and time again. All these fucking people died of heart attacks when they're in their 50s no, no, we're not taking it. We're not taking it well at all. This is not best case scenario for the human body. It's very stimulating. It's very crazy. But all the behavior aspects of it, all the problems, all the things that people do wrong, it's all been demonstrated in rat population density studies. Yeah. They've done those tasks where they have a couple rats in a big pan and the rats are cool with each other, but he's fine. And then they slowly jam him up until the point where rats become crazy. They're sitting in the corner, Buck and back and forth. They kill other rats. Chaos goes on. I mean it's really what it is. It's like either there's too much fucking stimulation and there's not enough resources, too much stimulation, but there's not. But I think beyond the stimulation, so you don't have a lot of, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:17:47       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:17:47       Like I could probably handle a lot of stimulation of my own choosing, you know, but it was a lot of stimulation that's not of your own choosing. So, I mean you're being bombarded by things like, like, like if there was some way to like add up, like if there's some way to quantify stimulation and like units, if I'm picking my subjects, like I might pick a tremendous amount in a given day. Like I'd be like, I'd like to be bombarded with this much stimulation, but they're 90% of my capacity might be filled by stuff that I didn't invite or even want it. It's just thrown at you. It's to the point where I, when I started hanging around there, I did it very reluctantly. And at the time I didn't even, I didn't have a home. I have two brothers and one's in Montana, ones in Alaska and they both, when this is all going on, you know, six, seven years ago, whatever they were in that situation where they had, you know, they were making money, like they were out of school and making money, but they didn't have a wife to tell them really how to spend it yet, you know, so they had like nice houses that were empty and I could just live in their homes.

Speaker 4:          00:18:49       And so I live Tanner, I live with my brothers and they thought they were like patrons of the arts, you know, to have, they have this writer brother and he's sometimes lives in the basement or sometimes he's off doing whatever he does. And when I came to New York and started being at my girlfriends and I would come for a few weeks or whatever amount of time, we both recognize that something was wrong for being there to the point where we would say, Oh, if we get married, we would of course move somewhere else. And then it became, we got married, they'd be like, well once she's pregnant we would of course move somewhere else. And then she got pregnant and it's like, well by the time the baby is born we will of course split. And now maybe by the time he's five we're supposed to split.

Speaker 4:          00:19:32       He's a year and a half right now. But it's like we know every day we wake up, we're like, something isn't like there's some thing that we, there's some reason that this really easy to stay very hard to leave really cause of work. Man, she has like a good job. I have, you know, I'm busy with various projects. It's really hard and when you see so much of the country suffering and we should tell everybody about your new show before we even go to meet eater. It's on when it's on Sundays, 9:00 PM on sportsman channel and you can probably find it just by looking at meat or in a search. That's the best way to find shows. You know, fucking find the sportsman channel. What channel is that? Okay, well somebody got the other channels like I don't know what comedy central has no idea what channels already be eight and 13 but people really know ABC, NBC, CBS.

Speaker 4:          00:20:17       You'd be like, it's not in three, right? Yeah, I remember, I remember channel seven was ABC. Yeah, I totally, that's all gone. I don't know what any channel is. I just look for the shows. No. Yeah I have no idea. I found out the PBS is 13 cause my boy likes to watch a little Elmo now and then and that's the only one I know by number. But no, it's on sportsman channel. Sunday nights, 9:00 PM. Um, it's available widely often to premium channel. Is it also available on iTunes and stuff like that? If people, it will be though we've only been, you know, we've only been Erin for three weeks, but that episodes will eventually be available across a variety of formats. But right now that's where it is right now on. I was a big fan of your show, the wild within. I really enjoyed that show man.

Speaker 4:          00:20:59       That was great. I loved the one when you, uh, when across the country and like tried to live like Lewis and Clark and shot a buffalo with a musket and shit. Like the whole deal. I was like, wow. Like this is, this is a fun show. Bombed out has been huge into um, I've always been huge into that Lewis and Clark idea and in that one to nutty fucking idea, man. Dude. But the thing, here's the thing I dig about Lewis and Clark and you'll, you'll appreciate this. We were just talking about New York so much, but like Lewis and Clark, so early 18 hundreds you know, they split out of Saint Louis and they go over the two year journey, you know, go all the way to the Pacific and come back and there's places along that route there. Now of course towns, you know, and I've lived in a number of, in Bozeman, Montana, Missoula, Montana where they wandered through and now it just looks like a town and people live there.

Speaker 4:          00:21:50       There's a lot of places they went, for instance, this place called the Missouri breaks where nothing ever happened there again, you know, and you can go to New York and in some of them might be like, oh, you know what right here, like John Lennon got shot right here. It doesn't feel like Andy because so many other layers of things have happened. You know what I mean? Like other people died there and people got arrested there and you know, people built houses there and tore up the sidewalk and made a new sidewalk and it winds up being an after awhile. It becomes, it's worse than being buried by years. It's just been buried by layers of experience. But we're floating on a Missouri breaks. When I, before I even thought of the idea to do that episode, were flown on a Missouri breaks and I was with a writer friend of mine.

Speaker 4:          00:22:31       I was kind of a mentor of mine, he and Frazier and we're laying there in the spot where we knew they can't because it's in her journals. They described these camp spots. He's like, no one, like basically they were here and then a couple hundred years went by and now we're here and you can see it. You just look at the ground and it'd be like, you might find like one of their tools, someone, yeah. Something was like, it's possible to feel history in a, in a more immediate way. And that's not even old history. I mean, you imagine like there's bars in England. Yeah. If it had been open continuously longer than it's been since Lewis apart went out west. So everything like in, in, in, in the western US old is not old. Old as only Olin comparison. Yeah. Yeah. Only old relative, but that's why I always did that stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:23:16       And I've always had a real penchant for like, like just going to archaeological sites where maybe it's just a lack of imagination. But if I can look and there's still some little stone shards laying underground, I'm like, this I can relate to. If you, you, I'm sure you've found arrowheads and shit, that's pretty cool. I found a number, arrowheads, but the problem is getting into arrowheads is you get into a level of kind of sewer ship where the only really cool stuff, it's like the ice age stuff like Folsom, Clovis. Uh, so now like once I started getting into seeing him, I got in my mind that the real one would be this. And so now I'm perpetually dissatisfied because you don't find, I found the arrowhead. I'm African. You have to find them yourself. Correct. It's not, it doesn't mean shit. If you go buy one on Ebay and you know it's, you know what buying them on Ebay is almost better than when the dude next to you find someone.

Speaker 4:          00:24:09       We're just filming. We were filming a meat eater episode in Arizona and I'm down on my hands and knees scouring in outside this cave entrance for stone charts and we had, just for the moment we had this double, a kid that works on this ranch came out and see what was going on and he's kind of like wondering why I'm doing this. And he's like, well here's the arrowhead right there. And it was the only Arrow had we found and he just picked that thing up. I'm kind of cursing it. I find chunks, you know, and we call them shards or if you want to get even more technical, they call him a lithic remains or something like that. This little bits of stone, you wouldn't even know if he saw it. But to me it's like I have a pile of Matt home basically.

Speaker 4:          00:24:51       It'd be like if you're whittling a stick, I find the little chunks, the flight and I never find the sharp stared. And how do you know that that's how they're created. It wasn't just like something falling on something and there's a thing called a can coital fracture. I may be pronouncing it first. And that's how they create the Ed. Yeah. It winds up being that it just doesn't get replicated from two rocks banging together. Freezing. Does it replicate it? It's like a pressure flake [inaudible] tool stone. Like we always say like arrowheads are made out of Flint, like Chert, Flint, obsidian, personal night, all these different things. Fracture in a specific way when slow pressures applied to them and you'll look and there'll be like a this dome shape thing on it and it, it's, it's considered to be, it's technically diagnostic. Like you can look at it and you would be able to say like in the peer reviewed scientific journal that that is a human worked stone.

Speaker 4:          00:25:44       Oh, okay. You know, it's, it's that obvious. I get eight has to be replicated by repetitive yeah. Shipping. And they look at it like you'll, you'll look at it. It's not like, oh, I think that was, no, that was uh, you know, that was a fractured stolen by how long ago did they first start doing that? Like, how long did people just shoot arrows at shit? You know, like when, well, when was the first bone Arrow? Do you know? They say the Bono was invented many times. Not many times. I could be wrong, I'm just, but the bone marrow may have been invented six or seven or more times. Really? No humans first arrived in North America through Siberia in the Bering land bridge, maybe, you know, with big foot maybe 13, 14, 15,000 years ago. Somewhere in there. It's like, it's hotly debated, let's say 14,000 years ago when they arrived here, they were making very intricate stone points that were more ornate and technical and beautiful than things that were being made thousands of year later.

Speaker 4:          00:26:41       But they didn't have the bow. There's been more human. His, they were just spears. Yeah, probably like, uh, they think that what was in use most widely may have been an adult ladol like a throwing board. Okay, so a spear with like a thing that you throw it with. Yeah, it'd be based, it's like an extension of your arm. So it'd be like a board that you can get more leverage that you see people at the park throwing for a dog, like throwing a tennis ball for a dog. Imagine a contraption like that that helped you throw a spear. Yeah, I think I've seen those and they were, well, you know, it's the old hippie thing like old hippie guys, you know, the kind of like old hippie guy who would go out, for instance, he may be like has an old Hippie van and he likes to nap arrowheads in, in, in uh, has a lot of feathers and rocks and stuff on his dashboard.

Speaker 4:          00:27:28       Those guys would get into adult adults. Right. I see what you're saying. Now, all, all ad level guys are not old hippies but, but it's uh, it's an old hippie thing. It's not very well known that the same way playing disc golf, right? Frisbee, golf or whatever, where they call that Frisbee Golf. Like a certain dude plays Frisbee Golf, but not all guys that play Frisbee golf or those kinds of dudes. Certain guys play with atlatls. Yeah. There's certain people that look at Frisbee evolve and they just go, what the fuck man, I'm not doing that. Yeah, exactly. It's not really my thing. And so there is more human history in North America pre then post bone. So maybe the bone Arrow made the scene around this for 5,000 years ago. So the really all throughout the world, no, no, no, no Justin, I'm north places. Different Times.

Speaker 4:          00:28:13       So North American amendment four or five vans invented or did someone introduce it or is that not known? It would have been, and again, when you start talking about this stuff, it's, it's like very informed guesswork, right? If the people that arrived here that migrated into the western hemisphere, my migrated in North America, they arrived here without it and it emerged much later. You'd have to think did it emerged independently. People came here without it and it developed and they say, and like I said, I've, I don't know this for sure, by red at times that they think the boat emerged six or seven different times. Like certain things just get invented again and again. And I often like try to think when I tried to think of whether something's normal or abnormal or right or not. Right. I imagine that if you backed up human history to the beginning, so let's say you backed it up to like the African diaspora when when humans first left Africa to populate the world, if you backed it up and had everybody do it all over again, would it happen again? And I'm like, wearing your pants down around your hips will not happen again. You don't think so? No. It wouldn't happen again. Hunting and fishing, what happened again? For sure. Yeah. Do you know what I'm saying? But certain aspects of culture you'd think? Yeah, like writing books. I don't know. Maybe it was like, uh, maybe it wouldn't happen again. You know, singing songs. I bet you seeking something

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       would have happened again. Singing songs wouldn't know it would have happened to. Definitely. Definitely. As with jokes, jokes would be written. They would, it would, it would happen. All happen everywhere. In every culture. I think people are going to record keeping, but yeah, you're right. Like look at the different branches that civilization has taken. If you just pay attention to the world, like you know you've got to, I just got back from Brazil, you know, you're different cultures. That's a totally different branch of how, how you can live or go on and went off on their own trip and then their own trip happens to be in South America. Our own trip is up here in North America. I mean it's like you know, you have to change it based on your environment and how much you have to protect yourself from the environment as well.

Speaker 3:          00:30:17       You know that's a lot of how their behavior is based but it's a, it's amazing how many variables there are when you think about it. Yeah. Now that you bring up South America, I will tell you another trippy thing. I don't, I don't want to like drag design with the, with like human migrations up am I was in or interesting. I'm interested like through the lens like cause I like the hunt through the lens of honey. I'm interested in early hunters because these guys hunted all the time and for their life. That's, listen, this is a, there's a life and death struggle to that, that you know, we in this first world where you just go to the supermarket and get your food, whether you're immediately or not, I mean the, the, the lack of understanding and appreciation of hunting and gathering and that it's literally a part of being a human being.

Speaker 3:          00:30:59       Maybe not hunting. If you really become a vegetarian and you're, you're just gung Ho for that for whatever reason, you're allowed your own thoughts. I don't mind, I don't care. I don't want to change anybody's opinion on it, but you're just making your own vegetable garden, growing your own food and eating it and for surviving off some stuff that you have actually grown yourself. You have this like really intimate relationship with your food then, which I think is a part of being an intelligent thing that is aware of its environment. I think one of the issues that human beings have as a whole is that in order to feed us all, in order to move us all in the general direction that we move in and to do it in big cities that live on the waters, you're going to have a lot of waste.

Speaker 3:          00:31:37       You don't have pollution, you're going to have pro. It's just going to, it's not going to be done clean and tidy. It's going to be done wild and chaotic, you know, and a lot of it is because we are not feeling the damage that we're doing. It's not like we are, you know, shitting in our own backyard and going, man, maybe you should stop shitting in the backyard. This is ruining the whole place. No, it's happening somewhere that's not even anywhere near your house. And as long as you can get your cheeseburger, you don't give a fuck. You know, as long as you can pull into that drive through and then an ass friend number two large and just, you know, give him some paper and then you've got your food. It's that easy. That lack of connection when you're still a carnival, when you still an animal, you'll still a biological entity that's processing other biological entities and plants and you know, I mean you're, you're, you have to, you're living off living things period. Everybody is with your fucking vegetarian and not man, but we don't feel that. We don't feel that because, because we have completely distanced ourselves from the gathering and the growing and all that. We're like little children so we just shit all over the floor and that's, that's literally

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       and not men. My opinion, one of the number one things that's wrong with human culture, we've grown too fast for our biology I think. I think that's a valid point. And I would say, I hate to hammer it home and say like, Oh, you're not a complete person if you don't have the experience of putting your own food or growing your own food. I don't want to be extreme like that, but I'll say it like there's this whole suite of human activities that seem to help you develop and do a fuller person as does like pairing, eating like reading is helpful for your world perspective. I think that some amount of travel is helpful for your world perspective. I think that doing some, some hunting or or some sort of food gathering is helpful for your world perspective. Not even say we were talking about earlier New York earlier, I started a garden.

Speaker 4:          00:33:26       We have a lot, we have a 800 square foot garden in New York, which is a rarity and then I beat this garden into the, into the weeds and detritus that was in that backyard and I later had the soil tested and had very high elevated levels of lead and I've been trying to mitigate that over the years and get it under control from pollution from let it get what they want. When I set my stuff off to Cornell to have it tested and the paperwork they gave me said that people have a tendency to blame led paint, but of it was from just leaded gasoline that there was that much exhaust over those years of lead gasoline that just led to settle and assist near the surface. I remember when people were mad that they got rid of letting remember it. I remember like I remember like I graduated high school in 1992 I remember dudes have an old time old cars and they would have to buy led additive and added into old cars.

Speaker 4:          00:34:19       They couldn't get knighted gas anymore, you know? Yeah. I remember. It seems like so long ago now. It's crazy, but I'm thinking about it, but yeah, that awareness all of a sudden about loud, are you replacing this? So know there's a number things they tell you to do. A lower on the Ph scales lower, high, low as acidic, right? I don't know. Seven is neutral. Six is slightly acidic. They tell you to raise the Ph. They tell you to introduce a lot of organic matter and that will inhibit the plant's ability to pickup led and they tell you to not plant, um, things like potatoes and things where there might be actual physical contamination of dirt that the fear is it you're just eating dirt. It's not that the plants uptake, I mean the plant can't uptake led at some, at some amount under some conditions, but mainly they don't want you eating the dirt.

Speaker 4:          00:35:11       So it's spinach, which has a lot of folds. We're talking about insect contamination, knew there the same plants that would have a tendency to like hold insect eggs and you don't wash them out properly. They tried to get you to not grow that. So the ideal plant for leaded soil would be like leather. You grew a tomato for instance. It's way off the ground. It's very easy to clean. But dealing with that little battle, you know, just for the simple desire like grow food, you know, made me more aware of, uh, of the complications of having some level of an urban life. You know, it's like there's, it's in your mind like, oh, of course the city must be polluted. It's a city. But then to go out and see it in your yard and like battle it and have it put to you in numbers, you know, like you have blank parts per million lead really woke me up to that level and also kind of infuriated me in an environmental way to think that it seems like some kind of like God given, right, that if you've got dirt you should be able to grow plants on it and imagine that we're at a point where you're growing plants out of the dirt for, you know, the, this like you're advised against eating to me, you know, it was just kind of like upsetting.

Speaker 4:          00:36:23       It's upsetting to me. And again, it's like process that like weird lack of imagination where until something's really brought home to me really clearly. It doesn't make as much sense to me. I used to be not like, I used to tend to be not very sensitive, um, about deforestation or about development. And it was only until now when I go and visit where I grew up in all the woods I that I hung out in, you know, and I could leave my home and wander for miles and some directions. It just had to cross a road on them, but always be in the woods. It's all built up. It's all built up now. Wow. And so now I could have heard about it happening to a hundred other guys and it wouldn't have bothered me, but to go to my spots where I hung out and be like, yeah, I couldn't go where I used to hang out without crossing 20 people's yards. And getting hollered at all of a sudden makes me be like, you know what? We need to really check out

Speaker 1:          00:37:14       what we have for wildlife habitat and what we have for like places to hang out in what we have that hasn't been destroyed yet. And be maybe a little more conservative with it and a little more like parsimonious. And it's always those little awakenings that I get only on a personal level, man. You know? Well, I think we all experience information that way because if we didn't, there's so much that we're getting every day on CNN. I mean, imagine if he took every God damn story to heart. Like who was your own house that was getting foreclosed on, or your own kid that was kidnapped or your own friend that was shot or you know, you know your own house, but there's too much. It's too much information. So you see, oh, 10 people died in Iraq today. You're like, wow, I guess that really sucks man. You know, I feel bad for the family. You're not even really personifying.

Speaker 4:          00:38:00       You almost said it down to remind yourself at some news. You got to sit down and like take a moment and remind yourself to feel the emotion of it. Yeah. I find myself doing that all the time. Like, wow, you should really feel this should be, they should have like a sense of gravity to you. And, and I'd be like, now I will take a moment and allow myself to feel what I should feel. But you know, but maybe I'm too busy to feel.

Speaker 1:          00:38:21       Yeah. I, I've, I've heard like when people talk about the miles of the rain forest, that gets chewed up every year and those numbers are the, it's a staggering number. It's a terrifying number. Just miles and miles. A rain forest that gets eaten up and it really,

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       I can't, doesn't register. I can't, I can't register it. I know it's bad. It's bad. It's terrible. But am I feeling it? I'm not feeling it. I don't know why I'm not feeling it. I'm, I'm a concerned person. If you ha, if you said, hey, you can make the call, should they be allowed to chop down those trees? I'd say no. Stop right there. The rain forest is amazing,

Speaker 4:          00:38:54       but

Speaker 3:          00:38:54       still it doesn't matter you, you unless you see it, unless you're there, unless it's like a part of your life, you know. I don't, I don't think you're going to, it's, we flew over the rain forest because we, we went to Brazil this past weekend and it was day time while we're flying and I was looking down and I'm like, wow, that is fucking nuts.

Speaker 4:          00:39:11       Yeah, it's, it's I, the first time I flew over like the Amazon area, you grew up with one impression of wilderness. Like if you grow up with an American impression of wilderness and we have, we're very fortunate in our resources. I mean if you look at how much money we make and how many people live here and when we've done a pretty phenomenal job preserving some places to fly over like the northern half of South America. Yeah. Is so fucking crazy. I mean like, like I always look at everything like this, kind of like hunter angle and I looked down there and I'd like to know that there are people down there who've had very limited, perhaps no experience with the outside world because then that's used to seem to me like that can't be true. Did you fly down there and you realize that you've just flown four hours and there's been nothing, no road, no anything. You're like, oh, now it makes sense. Yeah. For guys live around the rain forest while you're going 500 miles an hour, you're like, a guy could live down there and you would never, you would never know.

Speaker 3:          00:40:11       Yeah. It's amazing. You know, they said that the most recent uncontacted tribe there, these photos of them and video, it's actually a hoax like somebody had, they had fucking fake.

Speaker 4:          00:40:21       Yeah. You know, I know I heard what you're talking about, the starving, but it was for a while they thought they advantaged, like people that were red. They were, they weren't.

Speaker 3:          00:40:30       Yeah. Red. Yeah. There's still on I and not uncontacted tribes, but tribes that have had very, very limited contact with the outside world, and it's just because the actual volume of it, but it's an amazing that there's environments where people live that they really just got to a certain point, they said, listen, fuck electronics and everything. Like it rains every day. That shit's not gonna work. We're never going to develop any of that. We just need to be really good with bows and arrows, and there's plenty of food here. It's just stop. I mean, and there's a lot of people that admire that and they look at that like, wow, there's something magical about the way these people live. Like I have friends that have gone to a different parts of South America for IOWASCA rituals. You know, you're talking about tools and you'll stay in these, uh, these camps, these, you know, these, these towns, these villages I guess with these people and these straw houses and you'll stay with them for like a week.

Speaker 3:          00:41:19       And one of my buddies went and was like, the crazy thing is like at first you see, you kind of feel bad for them, but then when you're leaving you kind of feel bad for yourself. He's like, fuck, I got to deal with bills and all this bullshit that the weather is always perfect here. When it rains they get inside. Yeah. I mean it's like they're like living in paradise and they're pulling fish out of the river on a regular basis. Shooting animals. The animals are everywhere. Stick together, look out for Jaguars were good. And you're like, man, who, if it is a temporary experience and it absolutely is. I mean, no one gets out of this alive who sues, doing it the right way. They look like they're having fun.

Speaker 4:          00:41:53       Yeah. I think too that it doesn't need to be like for, for, for ancestral hunter gatherers or people who are hanging out on land that they've probably been on for 10 generations, you know, 20 to infinity generations. Right. It doesn't need to be an all or nothing. Like I had the experience last winter. Um, so hunt with some guys in, in Guyana dam and they have some access to internet. You know, they have like DVDs laying around their place. They have a generator that gives them electricity some amount of time during the day. Um, they had never heard of pizza. One of them had a t shirt with Muhammad Ali on it. I asked them who that was. He, he didn't know who that was. So there's some, like they've had the t shirt but they don't know who's on it. Do you know what I'm saying? Right there.

Speaker 4:          00:42:44       Kinda like half, like a foot into the modern world and a foot out. But just due to the, to where they live. And due to financial constraints, they provide all their own food. So they raised their own food and these guys hunt 200 250 days a year if they don't have on it. Cause they got something today before they, they're a hundred fish every day so well because they're not, they don't have enough refrigerators to keep things. They don't bring it and it'd be too far to bring it to be too expensive to bring it and they have like ready access to stuff. So it would be that you to think that right now it's almost kind of an inspiring thought to think that right now there are people, I'll name one guy was guy named Rovan who wakes up, he's able to wake up and check his email and he's obligated that day to go hunt something for his family to eat for dinner.

Speaker 4:          00:43:31       It's like the, that these two things can still exist side by side. Wow. It's Kinda my binding because he can get a computer but he just can't get food, you know. And this guy has a remote garden area and his whole family will take, dug out canoes to the garden area and check on the garden and harvest what they have and tend to everything. Then they go back to their hunting camp and like turn on various things they've gotten through government grants and things and like in log on and, and see if you want to be his friend on Facebook. I'm not joking. It is. So it's so bizarre, you know, and just kind of tell that guy, that guy's a dress. I want to be his friend on Facebook. Oh, doodle have you over there. And they got like a, you know, he's got like a couple Puranas hanging up and he's making dinner.

Speaker 4:          00:44:11       Wow. So now what did you guys hunt for when you went there? We hunted, um, a number of large fish that the, hang on here, the servers, they have one. And when I say hunted, they fished primary with bows and arrows. So they're shooting fish. The one called a [inaudible] one called Airwatch. This was on your show? Yeah. Yeah, we do. Yeah, we do have down here the dude was like really good at judging the reflect refraction. Is that what it is to fix your feet when you're looking at the water? It's hard to see where the fish really is. There's like a little, he's not where you have to aim way low. So if you're, imagine that you're standing on the bank of a lake looking into lake and there was a fish who's maybe 24 inches below the surface,

Speaker 6:          00:44:52       mmm.

Speaker 4:          00:44:53       You would be aiming?

Speaker 6:          00:44:56       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:44:56       you'd be aiming a couple, let's say he's like, he's 10 feet from the bank, 24 inches below the surface. You'd be aiming at what would appear to be about three feet below that fish. So if you're looking at them from a standing position and there are any thing other than directly underneath you, there's an optical illusion. Is that what it is? Yeah, you got to aim low. But where they're hunting, they're hung in the river. So when I was growing up, we would shoot a lot of carp with bows in still water, um, in, in very fast modern bowls with really heavy fiberglass arrows. Which don't they keep their velocity when it hit the water pretty good. They're fast. These guys are shooting an arrow. It's actually boiling it, their Arrow floats. So the Arrow really slows down when it hits the water and they're shooting fish in moving water.

Speaker 4:          00:45:43       So not only are you judging refraction light refraction your where you know you have to aim low, you also have to aim way upstream. And the arrows are affected in a very profound way by all aspects of the water. Like the Arrow comes to a stop. It drifts into current. Very good cause it's buoyant. So if you're like, you might find yourself aiming at a, there's this herbivorous Parana there. It's like a favorite fish. That's the pocket. Yeah. You might be holding try. The fish is moving for one thing. So the fish is on the move and you're holding maybe what looks to be three feet below it and two feet out ahead of it. So that's where you're aiming as it's moving because you need to figure that that Arrow is going to drift down current. Wow. Before it makes contact with fish. That's like playing online video games with a shitty connection. If you've got 50, exactly six k connection number. That I wonder what happened when you play, when you play certain games, you'd have to leave the guy, you remember that Brian, when you had lag, you know, so you'd, you'd have probably been really good at this. Haven't had those experiences. But I shot at though I shot it, that kind of fish.

Speaker 6:          00:46:53       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:46:55       Around 25 times four. I hit one. Wow. Over the course of several days. Wow. So it was more than one day before you hit one. Oh yeah, man. So like I think I finally killed one on my third day and we would only go at optimum light when you have a good high sun, like saying like, like, like I like to fish with a fly rod for bone fish and stuff and just is basically good, you know, from 10 to two, like the lights right to, to, to see into the water. Another thing we did was we hunted birds, um, with bows and I brought down a, uh, a compound bow, like a modern boat. And they in those guys call it, some of those guys speak English. They've been trained to speak English in order to navigate in a modern world and with tourism and political issues because their national language is English, even though they're Macusa and they speak a tribal language.

Speaker 4:          00:47:42       Indigenously but so you could speak some English with them and they would call my bowl the fancy bow, you know? And um, they were blown away by the bow and I felt kind of like, at times I thought about leaving my bowl there, but I thought I'd be like, remember that God's must be crazy. Like that coke bottle flies out of that thing and like totally changes those people's lives. I was like, if I left these dudes with this bow, the jungle be gone, man. It'd be emptied of animals, you know, they would like get everything there so they'd have to make get arrows though. How many hours did you have? That's true. They would venture run out of arrows. Arrows are you gonna make aluminum arrows. And I would a jungle. These guys, what was funny too is um, you know, have all these crazy plants that they make their bowls narrows.

Speaker 4:          00:48:23       The only thing they need to make their bow and Arrow is they use a piece of hog fence, like a piece of wire fence and they use that to make part of the head. But I was saying like, what's that plant you make the arrows out of? He thinks about, he's like aero plan, you know, and then they got a plant today they called the Arrow plants and it's supposed to be straight like straight, straight, straight, like a laser man. And then they make, they pull these leaves to make string. They go out and harvest uh, Robert from a rubber tree to coat to string, like to wax a string. Wow. Then they get feathers. Like we went out and killed a bird. I with my compound bow, I shot a bird down out of a tree that they eat the Chrysalis curse. So there's like how many, um, if you say there was a hundred species of birds, what, what percentage of them do you think they eat?

Speaker 4:          00:49:11       The main, well are there certain brands you just can't eat? They're just no good. Most birds they would just, it wasn't a day disregard them. They would like observe them and discuss them. But it wasn't on their radar as a food bird as a flavor or is it a, I think it would probably wind up being, if I had to guess bird flesh. You'll find that like birds tend to taste pretty similar. You know there's not like bad tasting birds and you know it winds up being like a yield issue. So some of the birds or after would be that there's a strong likelihood that you're not going to get your Arrow or the Arrow will be damaged. So you're weighing like what does my Arrow worth? And there's these birds they like, like crustless Curacao, black Curacao would be something equivalent to a Turkey.

Speaker 4:          00:49:57       Okay. This, they still one of those and they would call them Po. There were poets or something. They would say when they see him they see one of those. Everybody get excited because it was just worthwhile. Like in a caloric sense, it was worth effort to try to get the current style. And the other thing about the black Chris, I was a black curse. I was what? They use a Fletcher arrows for the, for the feathers on the arrows. So when I shot a curse out, we went out at three in the morning pitch black to sneak up underneath where Curacao was hooting up in this tree and I, and I shot the down and he was really happy that I shot that bird down one for eating. But two because he would make, he told me he would make a year's worth of arrows off the feathers off that Corsol.

Speaker 4:          00:50:39       Wow. So how do they attach the feathers to the shafts they use? They'd take the on a feather, what do you call like the, like the part, they'd be like equivalent to hair. You have the vein and then you know, the other part they would clean a little bit off each end and they would just tie it in two places. Just wrap it in two places. So like imagine my finger being that they would wrap it on one end, then he'd wrapped on the other end and an aide caught a knock in there. And real simple. Yeah. And then they would, then they would have, they would attach the arrowhead, they would make a steel arrowhead out a piece of fence wire, but it would be socketed so it would fit like a male female joint. How did they do that? Because they would bend it.

Speaker 4:          00:51:23       They would, they would peanut over with a hammer on a rock fence wire. Yeah, they would beat it until it was flat, like aluminum foil thicker than aluminum foil. And then they could curl it. So it'd be like a piece of fence where, and you imagine is banging on a, imagine a pencil sized piece of wire and you bang on that thing until you have a thing on the end of it. This is about the size of a 50 cent piece of just flat, thin, malleable metal steel. You can then shape that into whatever shape you want. They would shape that into uh, like a, uh, a socket it end that would shape it into like a cop and that cop would fit over the tip of the end of the stick. That's the end of the Arrow. What did they do before there was fence wire or four people came along where they could cut their wires, a stone and bone, they would use stone and bone.

Speaker 4:          00:52:15       And so there's a fairly recent thing. Yeah, I mean fairly read, I mean metal age, but you know like even like precontact you know, like many of the track here, you know, in, in our portion of the hemisphere in North America precontact there's people using copper know, like we're like we're, I'm from native Americans. They were already had copper technologies put together. So it's not, you could hardly argue that it's a modern technology to take metal and hammering. I'm kind of malleable metal and hammered out. However it is very modern technology to cut it off a piece of fence, you know. So they would do that and that would be the one that'd be the one main, main part. And here's the thing is this isn't like those guys being cute like early, we're talking to like old hippies who like to make addle. Addles this is guys, these are the pragmatic people, you know, trying to stay alive, like making equipment.

Speaker 4:          00:53:06       Um, but beyond that they took to it, uh, certain flourish. Uh, each guy might have some little thing he would do to make his special ed. He would wrap a black that he'd like do black thread and then he wouldn't put the rubber on some of his thread and do like a little bit of and then do some more black and he wrapping it up so that it would be like as little signature style. Um, so it was a very pragmatic device. They're hunting kit, but along with it would become some amount of ornamentation or personalization. The same way. You know, you buy a car and I put a van, he played out under change rooms. Like you're like, this is mine. You know, like you look at this and you know, it's mine. And they would have little things like that they did, but that ornamentation wouldn't really extend to like to their physicallness like they would largely where you know when you picture that people bring clothes and donate old tee shirts and someone puts them in a barrel and sends them off.

Speaker 4:          00:54:08       I mean they would just be dressed in American throwaways, like maybe sweat pants cut off and a tee shirt that might say Lord knows what I mean. Anything on it. And they would always, always barefoot. How long did you spend with these people? Spent two weeks with him. Wow. Yeah. Just living like they live. Yeah, we ate everything man. We ate just tons of stuff, you know, get sick at all. Never know. You know what? I know. I don't know how cause I usually get sick. I just spent four days in the hospital from being sick. Did four days in the hospital from like a water for water? No waterborne, waterborne, waterborne ailments and Ted Yardi or you cola or something. I had been this kind of funny story because we had, we were filming a meat episode in Northern California and I got into a killed a wild pig and wild pigs role and poison oak.

Speaker 4:          00:54:58       They like to roll in it. I had heard of this place for foreign, killed a pig and came home and had poison oak. And so this time when I went out, I just really watched for poise, not make sure I didn't get any poison, don't, but then kill this pig. And the next day I'm, I have sleeves of infection, I'm arms and I had apparently did a groin will scratch and that was all, you know, how does Steve, oh, not get any of this. Remember we were talking to him about drinking like jungle water. But yeah, he's a fucking drinks, drinks, tap water everywhere he goes over the world for his immune system. No, I believe it. Well, I mean, think about it man. Like when you get a dog and you get a new puppy, now he's going to get GRD a couple of times and he never did.

Speaker 4:          00:55:37       Gets it again. You build a tolerance to it, but so this is a story starts to make its own gravy. I realize it's kind of a long story, but I got the poison oak so bad they put me on prednisone. Wow. It's a wow. It's so pregnazone can compromise your immune system. We then were we, we were in Arizona filming and we were hunting Cuzdey are down there and ran out of water, a whitetail subspecies called coups dear. Oh, so who's is slang for vagina? Is it really? He didn't know that. No. I know some variations of that but not that word. Coups. Brian boy, her son. I accrues once a month but I never, I never knew trolling was trolling was for gay guys either. Cause I tell people in Ohio I'm trolling and they like all wink at me and starts really trolling for gay guys.

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       For Northern Pike. Yeah. Trolling online, like you know, trying to get people to pay attention to a ridiculous story for his own amusement. That's called online trolling, trolling, trolling for fishing. That is what a trawling as well. But it's also, it's probably, that's probably the dawn of it. Well, she didn't steal it from online people. Yeah, no, absolutely not. The online people, I think they created a trolling because it's sort of like they got a little lower. Let's see who bites. Let's see. Let's see. He's with dummy argues with someone who doesn't really believe what they're saying, what they're only saying things to be ridiculous. I used to think it was cute, but now I find it tiresome. There's not enough time in the world. So you get sick. Yeah, I'm, the button is off and I had drank, drank water out of this canyon and sometimes the treat water with iodine tablets, but the key with iodine is you've got to let it sit.

Speaker 4:          00:57:09       So he did this for the show or you did this because you were just, when we were filming show and ran out of water, but we weren't like drinking creek water as content because when we're doing stuff we like really, you know, we really will walk along ways and run out of stuff and eat some food out or eat meat out or bought her out in the process of making our shelves. So we just got in a situation where we had no water, went down into a canyon, found some water and I was very thirsty and I put my iodine tablets in my bottle and, and didn't let them dissolve. I mean I waited for the water to turn a little brown, but the tablets are still fine in a, in a drank the water. A couple of other guys drank the water and they both brought up with like a mild case of the shits later.

Speaker 4:          00:57:55       But because I had the pregnazone thing is what I like to blame, I came down full. Was it the really serious colon infection? Whoa. In wound up. Yeah man. I wound up in the hospital for four days. Holy Shit. Yeah, that's terrifying. That weighed that I lost so much. I don't think I've weighed that amount since I was 14 I lost so much weight. Wow. I'd imagine. And like dude, if you lose weight, I know. I keep thinking like we were joking about that like selling where you send that if you get FDA approval. Yeah, just send water from that Right Canyon to people as a diet plan. Alpha Puke isn't that ridiculous that people are so God damn week that you have to give them some sort of a pathogen, some sort of a horrible disease in order for them to have an excuse to not eat like a fucking pig.

Speaker 4:          00:58:42       Now it is. But this, I mean this is not, I mean this knocked me back in a big way and really it was kind of the first moment when I really started to feeling my years. Like now I feel like a much older man cause I had never been in a hospital except for the day I was born. I would imagine it's very taxing on your immune system. Has something like that happen. I mean it must be just devastating. I was beat up man. I felt like a like a week old man. I know prednisone can really fuck you up. I have a friend who has sarcoidosis and that's one of the things they gave him. They gave him prednisone. I don't even know what that is. What is that? Some sort of a lung disease early and I'm not exactly sure what it is, but it was, it was, it fucked

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       him up bad. He gained a lot of water. He was, we call the time and just really, really didn't enjoy it at all. You could really tell. The other thing about, you know when he loses a lot of weight, people can goof on you but they can't goof on you and you gain a lot of weight. So if you lose tons of weight, you'll walk in the room. People be like, you look like shit. Yeah, you look like Shit, you lost so much weight. But if you come in with the gut, they can't say anything. No. People are going, you look like shit. You're really fat. You can't say that to people, man. You live in a strange world. You live in a different world than May. We've Brian walked in and he and he had a guard. We would turn on him like sharks.

Speaker 1:          00:59:55       Well if you got got bigger, if anybody loses way we compliment them. But yeah, if somebody gets fab where like you fat fuck, what are you eating? Lard all day. This is where comedians man, we don't play nice like that. We call it like we see it and we, you have to have the ability to laugh at yourself too. Cause some you're going to fuck up too. So I should have been hanging out with you guys when I went through this. Cause I had to hear about how bad I looked. Well yeah, well that's, they think that it's okay to say. I see what you're saying. Like it's like culturally acceptable to talk about someone. And he retired about a man who like almost died. You know, in my, I was passing blood. Well

Speaker 4:          01:00:30       to the point where it wasn't like bloody diarrhea. Oh, it was, you could, I was thinking about calling the Red Cross and having them bring some bags down and he's bagging it for transfusion rate. This blood was straight, perfect blood.

Speaker 1:          01:00:45       Oh my God. It was like, I just thought, why am I, where were you with the Arizona? You said they drank this water. Yeah. Magic was African water. You'd be dead right now unless you're Stephen. Yeah. Well he drinks tap water though. This guy's drinking river water. No, but that's a big difference, man. I believe. I believe this guy's on to something because you know,

Speaker 4:          01:01:06       people didn't spend their whole life having waterborne parasites, making them sick. You do it and then you like the ones having high infant mortality. So like some kids are born and they, they don't, they don't get it worked out. And some kids are born in water, doesn't make them sick. Jumping in the jungle, water in the wild boys, uh, videos. That's what we were talking about. He was just swimming through the jungle water and it's like, how are, how are you not dying

Speaker 1:          01:01:29       if, I guess he wasn't drinking it, but yeah, you're right. Just getting in to see if we get in there. Well, you know, you ever seen that one of those shows a about um, I forget the name of it. It was one of those shows on, I believe it's on the history channel where they, they talk about different pathogens are different parasites and get into your skin and like eventually burrow their way into your fucking brain and like, you know, people don't even realize there's something wrong with them. Headaches and transport four foot one when you're burning calories, they went swimming in Africa. It's always like, well we just happened to be swimming in some still water in Africa. Like what? What the fuck are you doing? It almost still feel sorry for them, but check it out. They do down there. We were talking about in Ghana they do have that, that one that goes up your urethra.

Speaker 1:          01:02:11       Yes. When you pee. Yeah. It follows your urine, the warmth of your urine something and it goes right into your penis and camps and out. That's the real like that. Totally. We'll get you out. Know he's the real deal. If they can't get it all out, they have to split your deck like a hot dog and go in and clean it. You split your hot dogs open. Some people do and not me. And microwave does that for them. So yeah, it does put a weird little crew. That's was when I was a kid. I used to like to cut the ends. I used to like to like it put a little in the x on the ends and they would spread out when you put them on the grill. I don't know why. I Dunno why I liked that. I used to like that she'll eat that frozen or not even like the cook cheese ones where the cheese, they had the cheese in the middle of the dance still is going on in like a fancy pants way now.

Speaker 1:          01:02:55       Yeah. Cheesy dogs. But I think now you know how like people always doing like you take not like an old trick and make it new with food, but it's kind of like there's like this sort of retro Foodie kind of thing. Right. I think there's a retro foodie movement right now is same way that pot pies got fashionable for meatloaf. It's fashionable. I think that there's like artisan cheese dogs know. Yeah, that's funny. Artisan cheese, cheese dogs. A good hot dog is an underrated thing. If you can go to a real good, get a real good deli hot dog from a place that makes her own. They really know what the fuck they're doing and when you bite into it, it snaps. You know those hot dogs, that's an underrated thing. That was a bright hot doesn't, yeah. It's not like the typical ones that come in the packages and you open them up and they're all mushy now.

Speaker 1:          01:03:41       These like you still IX, they snap when you bite into a man and that's a real fucking hot dog. When I'm the stylistic for though, and this might've been, oh, you're from the Midwest. All right. No, no. I grew up in, well, I was born in New Jersey mostly. I grew up in Boston. Oh, I thought you guys talking about going back home though. He's Ohio. He's, he's from Ohio. I just got, oh, I'm really from everywhere. I lived here. I lived in San Francisco from seven to 11. I lived in New Jersey to seven San Francisco, seven to 11 Florida. 11 to 1313 to 14 one part of Boston. 14 to eight 19 another part of Boston. I smoothed all over the place. New York, La. But I've been here more than anywhere. So when you say back home, people don't know what you're talking. I don't have a back home.

Speaker 1:          01:04:20       There's no back home. I guess it would be Boston. That's where, you know, I associated people ask me, you know, that's where I grew up. That's, you know, that's uh, that's where I started doing comedy. That's where everything started for me. So anything from Joe, lot of Boston, I just don't like the winter. Well, the girls, I mean, and not all the girls, most of the girls. What, what were you discharged? You don't, you don't like what you don't like 50% of the year and you don't like 52% of the population has, no, no, no, not say 50 route 52% is all women. That's like saying I don't like all, it's not that I don't like the women in Boston, it's so, I don't like some of them. It's a small percentage. It's probably only like two or three per percent, but you're going to run into that yet

Speaker 7:          01:04:56       that fuck that Kale outside the fucking ass hall. Nothing's ever going to work out with you

Speaker 1:          01:05:03       and they're drunk and they're yelling at you and it's just do I think you're being way generous on that number, by the way, that's 2% come. That's what you gotta do. Sometimes you gotta sometimes you gotta fucking kiss babies. All right, I'm being a politician here. What will you miss?

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       [inaudible] the Midwest before it all fell apart when the use to be able to go, if you kept your eyes peeled, you'd be able to find gas stations that would have as many as four hotdogs for a dollar. Oh yeah. So that was how bold purchase it was. Just a thing that was available, but you could always, always get two hot dogs for a dollar. Wow, that's amazing. It was. I noticed the little rollers, you know what I mean? Oh yeah, those seven 11 one so they're just done. Yeah, and then it had the barn steamer. They have a bunch of money. My brother used to, he used to want to get one of those roller buns, steamers, and just when, when like people came from out of town to visit. Just like just load that up, put the buns and steam and be like, Hey, upon steamers house, everybody's on their own. He's really made hot dogs on the roller bunks or a Costco membership. I can't tell

Speaker 3:          01:06:11       my favorite way to eat, man. We were just in Brazil and a Ari. Oh my pal Ari Shaffir came with me and we went to a Brazilian steakhouse. Was to husker reason really that big of a difference between Chicago. Damn. It was good. [inaudible] is great for Fau goes great. This place was on another level. It was called Marius Tude. God Damn, that food was good. First of all, I just think I've been eating grass fed beef a lot lately. That's my thing. I try to buy grass fed whenever I can because whole foods usually has a pretty good selection of grasp it. It's a little more expensive, but it tastes different, man. It tastes like it's a world different. It's a healthy animal, you know, I don't know what they're serving them in Brazil, but it's the right shit. That fucking meat was delicious and they just, that's where they created that type of cooking over fire and they'd bring, you know how, what you ask Korea works for folks who don't know, there's a, you get a card and one card is green and the other side is red and they uh, this is how they do it.

Speaker 3:          01:07:04       And most of them, and they come up to your table and they see green. And when you can't take any more, cause it's all you can eat. They just keep coming by with more and more food on, on, on, on swords, you know, and just such cotton slices of meat off and they give you tongs and you're, you're putting you just, it's an orgy of, of flash. I mean, it just gets completely out of control. I've been a good ones before, but this one in Brazil just kicked all of them and they pick, they feed it people zillion barbecue. Ooh they do man in Rio. Rio is a, that's a whole nother world man. It was a whole nother world that, that place looks, first of all it's like a movie. It me, you might as well be an Avatar. You know when you fly and you see the Jesus on, on the top of the mountain and then you see the favelas and then you see like all these people on the beach or something.

Speaker 3:          01:07:47       What an amazing place we were. Me and Ari were all fucked up cause at the time difference because it's like six hours ahead of them. So like it's seven o'clock in the morning. We were up just chilling on the porch looking at the uh, the, you know, these like islands that come out of the ocean seven o'clock in the morning and there's kids playing soccer, like playing a full game of soccer, early risers, man, nobody's watching them. We saw them show up with their ball, like they woke up in the favelas or wherever the fuck live and nobody, no one's watching them. They're like nine years old and they just wandered out onto the beach and they all got together and then at one point in time it started raining. So they got under a tree and they were all singing really nine and 10 years old don't work for the tourism commissioner said, dude it was, it was wild shit dude.

Speaker 3:          01:08:33       It was really, it was a magical thing to watch. I was watching all these people show up either barefoot or in flip flops and shorts on and everybody just looked chill as fuck. Everybody was just wandering around. There was dudes bringing big truck fulls of coconuts, not truck fulls right away, excuse me, bike bike baskets, giant bike baskets. They all had these bikes. Everything got moved around with bikes like ice and coconuts and they would have a bike and at the front of the bike would be this giant fucking metal basket and it would be filled with like, you know, seven, eight bags of huge bags of ice. And these fucking dudes be riding these things uphill and that's, they did. They go all up and down the beach and sell their eyes and sell their coconuts and drop him off and come back and it's like you're watching another world man, and everybody's happy as, fuck.

Speaker 3:          01:09:22       I've heard all these things about Brazil and push. I was really dangerous and don't go by in heroin in the projects. Okay, but if you don't do that, it's like Copacabana beach. That might be one of the most beautiful things that I've ever seen in my life. Everybody just hanging out or they're like, they have the little bars and little cafes on the beach. Everybody's just hanging out laughing like this isn't like the didn't set this up. They're not waiting for my arrival to put on a show like one of those North Korean vice episodes. This is how these fucking people live every day, all day. But that's the spirit of, they're in the news right now just for the day. It's like a renaissance there right now or that their is exploding. Yeah. They're in the middle of having like the creation of a middle class. You know, they're, they're the fifth largest economy in the world now.

Speaker 3:          01:10:07       I mean, it's amazing, but it's, Brazil's exploding. They have all sorts of natural resources. They're just trying to tap into it. For the longest time it was just like, you know, they still have a logging issue. They still have to deal to what we were talking about before a station. That's sad man. And you, you see the conflicts between the loggers and the poor people that live in these villages and it's scary, scary shit. I just think all those dudes losing their hunting spots. Yeah. And they cut those trees down. Listen, I've never been hunting, but I've been wanting to go hunting for years and years. Ricky Schroeder is a buddy of mine and he's a big hunter and he's always there. He's always, oh, he's a huge hunter. That fucking guy. He goes, we just went last week and he went to Texas. He take, he has two boys.

Speaker 3:          01:10:44       One of them is 21 of them is like 1918 and he takes them everywhere. It takes them hunting in Africa. It takes some hunting all over the world. He's a, he's a freak. He loves it. And, uh, his, his wife his best, he's with my wife. And so I became friends with them. So when we've been threatening to go hunting forever, I'm just ridiculously busy and I've never put it together. But uh, but I, I, I, I think the ideal way to live, I watched a Yo MTV, Yo MTV cribs. No, I'm, I'm combining TV raps. I'm combining two different shows. MTV

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       cribs. I watched, uh, you know, whatever the fuck it's called with Ted Nugent. He's living in Michigan and this is what I became a, a part of a several year long fascination with Ted Nugent that I have, but he lived in his house in Michigan, unlike fucking, I don't know how many, a thousand acres or some shit, all high fenced with animals roaming around. And he would just get an ATV drive to his hunting stand and just fuck them up all day. And that's where it got all of the food, but not, yeah, but it'd be like if a farmer is no different than if a farmer woke up, went out and shot his cows and acted like he was hunting them. No, but no, but it's way better then than buying store bought food. He's still in an area where you know that there's animals, but that's how he's producing his food. I've heard that argument that there's something not cool about it or not. It just becomes an issue of cheating becomes a Semana. It becomes a semantics issue. Right. So for a real hunter, that's not real.

Speaker 4:          01:12:14       It's my brother's a hunter. Okay. Like my brother Matt, very avid hunter, he also has land where he runs goats and sheep. Now when he goes out and kills a goat or sheep, he doesn't say that he went out hunting. Right. You know, cause it just confuses because hunting's a word that, I mean the reason we have languages in order to be able to discuss complex ideas,

Speaker 1:          01:12:35       what is the issue is the issue, the fact that the animals are contained and you know, they're definitely going to be there.

Speaker 4:          01:12:40       Yeah. It becomes like an issue of what I would say is there's a term that we use in the hunting community like fair chase and it has a pretty pretty solid definition of being that um, that the animal has a reasonable chance of alluding capture. If you're hunting on a high wire fence thing, you know, like Huntington side fence, the animals, they're not regardless, fair chase. And so various organizations that may be like record books that would keep side like keep track of sizes of animals. They might not recognize an animal killed that way. So you might grow up, it would make sense. You might grow up in deer on a high wire fence and Boone and Crockett, um, which is uh, a scoring organization that promotes fair chase ethics. They might say like, we don't, we don't welcome an animal taken that way into our books and we don't even really appreciate you using our scoring system.

Speaker 4:          01:13:35       Right. That, that makes sense. And I'm definitely like, I'm not, I'm not familiar with that organization. I was saying that that might be something they would say. Now for me, the the, where it becomes an issue for me, and I'll say that like I grew up in Michigan, I've been to Ted Nugent's annual whiplash bash. We grew up listening to Fred Barrett. When I'm in Michigan, I still cruise the FM dial hoping to pick up, you know, stranglehold Wang Dang, you know, whatever. I love it all. But [inaudible] just done a lot for hunting isn't a lot to promote hunting. He does a lot of great conservation work. He does a lot of charitable work. Milo, the only way I like part with him, Dunaway I the, the thing that he does, and I don't really understand that, I don't understand the high wire. I don't really understand like hunting that way when you could be hunting other ways. I would never tell a brother that he can't raise animals on his land and he can't raise farm animals on his land and shoot him. I mean it's just not my place to say what you should be able to do with like an illegal sense. But I do feel a sense, I do have like a proprietary sort of notion or a sense of ownership.

Speaker 6:          01:14:42       MMM.

Speaker 4:          01:14:43       Over how we use the word hunting. So I want to make sure that when we as a country, when we're talking about hunting and what hunting means and whether hunting's right or wrong or what hunter should be allowed to do and should be allowed to do, I just want to make sure that we're all talking about the same thing. And for me, hunting,

Speaker 6:          01:15:01       yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:15:02       In this day and age means of, of fair chase on. So when I'm talking about hunting on top of hunting animals that have a reasonable chance to get away that you're hunting animals. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:15:11       I can totally understand that. For personal satisfaction. However, if you just trying to cultivate healthy food and, and in control your own environment in that way where you're self sustaining, which is essentially what he's doing, hunting, whatever you want to add on top of that, providing to all sorts of different charities and he gives me the way constantly to, you know, to needy families and things. So it's like he's providing a service and doing something that he enjoys and yeah, you know what they are fenced in and there are, there are animals there, but this is not what you want. Aren't you trying to get animals? Like why is it better if it's hard to do, like I understand that there's some satisfaction while you would go to the woods or fuck track an animal and find your name, but if you're, if you're, what you're trying to do is be self sufficient and sustaining life in a natural way.

Speaker 1:          01:15:54       Well, if you've got 2000 fucking acres man, and you're just sitting there waiting for an animal to come on and essentially it is hunting. You're, you are hunting, you're not farming, you know, you're still, you still have an actual wild environment that these animals are living in and you invade that environment to, to provide your family. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I see what you're saying. But it's one of the bunch of using Cabelas catalog jerking off with fucking cammo underwear on, you know like Ooh, you're putting it, you're put it to me. Like I'm saying there's something wrong with it. Well you are sort of saying that you part ways with him with the high fence that you don't think it's fair chase. No, but yeah, but I'm not saying it, I'm not arguing that it should be illegal or I'm not arguing anything.

Speaker 1:          01:16:28       I'm saying it doesn't appeal to me because it doesn't have, it's beyond like Huntington, me is beyond pragmatism. Like when I, when I go out to hunt, I'm not only thinking, oh this is like a way to get food because that's in a way mental masturbation. I have a lot of ways to get food right, but I can, I can go. But if you chose to be self sufficient and to exist off wild game, wouldn't that be the right way to do it? Because if you decided to have a fucking farm, you had 2000 acres and as well, you know I'm going to do on a tie these deer up and this little corral here then shoot one in the head every time. I didn't want to eat one. Wouldn't it be better for both the deer and for you if you allow them three one free run, a free range, wild animal live like they should live.

Speaker 1:          01:17:06       So that is hunting though. Is it that I would say that it's free range farming or free range riders. I prefer wild game. I really do el cause like some of my favorite food. I love Venison. I like like a gaming meat. It's delicious to me. Wouldn't, I don't say gaming in a negative way. But you know there's a, there's a taste that a wild animal Brazilian beef because when you're on a like, like animals on a strict grass died, it takes them longer to come of weight. So you might like here in 14 months it, if you're finishing a mountain grain, you can bring your car to slaughter weight and you know, 13 14 million people don't even know folks. But it takes, it takes three years to bring them up. It could take two years, three years, bring them up. So you're eating the older animal.

Speaker 1:          01:17:47       When you go to a supermarket folks, and you get a steak and you see that marbling, you know, you see like a delicious ribeye and it's all filled with fat and they go, Ooh, that's gonna be great on the grill. That's fucking sick animal. That's 10 animals sick that animals eat the shit they shouldn't be eating. They're eating some shit they would never eat in nature. They're supposed to be in grass. He's eaten more than he would eat. Yeah, he's eating more than he would eat. And he's, he's eating in a different way and he's not being exercised. Right. And if you're getting cows that are raised in really cheaply, he might actually be eating some cow protein as well. I mean, that's where mad cow disease, he is come the legal now. But illegal now, but it's been done, you know, but I want to give back.

Speaker 1:          01:18:24       I want to really quickly get back to the idea of of the high fence, fair chase hunting grounds and Jason, listen, I'm totally playing devil's advocate. I know you are, and you're raising valid points because we're talking about two different things. You're talking about farming. Yeah. Hunting on your own spot. We know the animals are like it. Listen, if you have a pond in your backyard, they're not, those fish aren't going anywhere, bitch, they're just going to sell. They're not going anywhere. Man. Fishing, I think it's fishing, drainage ditch, and I say it's still fishing. It's still fishing. If you have your own pond, it's still fishing. You can't say we're talking about very loose, slippery terms. Yeah. I would say that if you took a Kiddie Pool, okay, let's say you have a Kiddie pool and I throw three or four bluegills in the Kiddie Pool, I would not say I went fishing today.

Speaker 1:          01:19:10       Right? Because I caught those blue goes that I had put into my kitty pool. What if it's a pippy comes different? What if it's upon, I would still not call that fishing. If I had like a pond in my backyard that I made, I wouldn't go. Yeah, I went fishing today. No, it wouldn't be. You made pine where I lived in Boston, I lived in Newton, Massachusetts on this street called Ellis Street. And if you go down Ellis Street, there's the Charles River on the left hand side, which would have these monster fucking carp. I mean you had never seen like there was, there was times when they were spawning when they were all going to get underneath the waterfall. It was fucking nuts, man. Me and my friends would go there and these be carp that were like, you know, as we were like, you know, 13 years old. So as far as we could put our hands out left and right. That's how big these fish where they were an enormous, enormous fish. And then down the road just a little bit was this really tiny bass pond. It was tiny, but there was a few big basket and like three and four pound bass in it and they would just fucking off all these other fish and this really small environment, but it was still fishing.

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       It was hard to catch those fucks. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It's slippery terms and I can't, I go fishing. I can cast all the way to the other end. I'd have, if I had a one ounce head weight upon, it could very well been fishing and I'll say this, and this may be what would help explain my perspective on this. I think that many aspects of what we do, like we appreciate challenge and we appreciate uncertainty. Okay. If I go out to hunt on public land or unfenced lands are uncontrolled lands, if I go out to hunt, I'm going out knowing that I'm entering into a complicated relationship, a complicated arrangement with the land, and there's a very strong chance that I will not be successful. And to overcome that, I have to strive and try harder and concentrate more than be better and challenge myself.

Speaker 4:          01:20:56       So when I fulfill my goal, it's knowing that I did it against some kind of like some kind of adversary, which should be the uncertainty of the landscape of the availability of animals. And that I overcame that through skill and concentration and effort. And so when I get that animal and eat that animal, I'm reliving and enjoying that challenge and the fulfillment of that challenge. And I think that people have, they do similar things in many ways where they hunt or not. For instance, people go to Italy, right to eat Italian food. You could just as well argue, why would you go all that way? Wouldn't it be so much more efficient just to eat Italian food here? And you're like, yeah, but they're ones that being more of a set of experiences that come with, with the reality of it. So while I would never say that my brother shouldn't raise a lamb and then go kill it, he would never, because he cares about these terms and cares about these things. He would never bullshit himself and act like he hunted that he was out hunting

Speaker 1:          01:21:56       sheep. I wouldn't do it naked naked. I'd put, I'd put war paint on and shit and I would hold the knife only in my teeth until I got ahold of the actual, and that wouldn't be hunting. That would be you being out being away. It sounds like with a knife. I totally agree with him and I think when met anyway, I'm not saying that should be illegal, but if you want to get naked with warpage, sheep can run and the sheep could bite than the sheep can fight back. If it chooses to, let me just kill it because I'm the Apex Predator of my backyard. Well that's the fucking, that's the sheeps fall. What Nugent is pretty much doing is using a cheat code in a video game. Well, he's in a much bigger place now. He moved to Texas. Yeah, I'm fascinated with Ted Nugent.

Speaker 1:          01:22:33       Moved to another place outside of Waco. A giant, much bigger. Same sort of a situation. Do you wanna you wanna hear my Waco deer hunting story? Sure. Okay. By the way. But before you say that Waco, the way you explain that, I just want to say eloquently put, that was a beautiful way of describing the, the, the, the spiritual quest of hunting and that it's so, it's a lot more than just acquiring food and just a about harvesting and cultivating food. It's a whole experience for you. It's a, it's a, it's a conquest. It's a challenge. It's a, it's, there's a, there's, it is an an ancient game,

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       you know, and, and you're, you're playing it with honor, you know, and I totally appreciate that. And then what I was saying, you know, as I said, devil's advocate

Speaker 4:          01:23:13       question was though, you raise raising valid one and it's stuff I never thought of it. Now I understand. I mean like tension surrounding the issue of hunting has like always existed. Know, I mean like you look at like the old testament like Esau and Esau and Jacob. I mean it's like right in the beginning there's been like tension of what, you know, how we all go and get our food. We have a responsibility to be cause we're thinking animals just comes up. It's like, so I'm beyond the point at a time when I used to for a trap, I used to do lot of trapping and sell animals and at the firm market I started trapping like very lightly when I was 10 and I was tracking very heavily, you know, in, in my early twenties. And is that how you learned how to cook a beaver tail?

Speaker 4:          01:23:55       That was nasty. That might be one of the nastiest whatever. It's interesting to eat that, but let me just look at that age. Okay. If like my blood would boil when I hear the word Peter, like I f I just want, when I heard like anyone who was against hunting or trapping or whatever, I would just be like, I just want to like tear into him. I was so full of anger about it. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah, sure. And in some way maybe I didn't understand, you know, my own arguments and stuff, but now you, there's nothing you could say against hunting would bother. You would piss me off. You could say a lot of things against hunting. The dot would be like, well, you know, there's this way looking at it, but there's nothing you could really bring up that would make mad like whatever. Part of my brain used to be able to get mad at people who don't agree with me.

Speaker 3:          01:24:42       It's just gone now. I find him the coward one is the most fascinating one. You know, Oh you coward, you want to kill innocent animals. I'm like, wow. And it's always for people with leather shoes on and shit. It's like my take on animals has always been I love animals. As long as they love me back, everybody else is getting eaten or get the fuck out of my way. There's a war going on between all animals on this planet. There's a constant battle for dominance. We're just so far ahead of the other animals that we kind of have forgotten. It's a war and we're like looking out for them, looking out for the other animals, sometimes more than we're looking out for 10 people and that's on a regular basis. There's a lot of people out there that are just confused, weird, sensitive people that for whatever reason they couldn't imagine killing and eating an animal. And when you don't realize is how many animals die buying. You're getting your fucking lettuce yell any rabbits and rats and rodents and gophers just get chopped up in those machines that are, that are, that are picking various vegetables and pulling them out of the ground that they kill a, an incredible amount of animals. Every time they harvest veteran,

Speaker 4:          01:25:43       well not that, but the amount of habitat destruction that went into creating a farms. It's, it's impossible to live a life that you can drive your self nuts, but it's impossible to live a life without blood on your hands. But I'm not sure it must live a life like I live a life with blood on my hands in a much more like recognizable, visceral way. And I think that, you know, I was having this discussion earlier tonight where, you know, Camille Pauley and she's kind of a, like a provocateur, maybe she has this thing, she wrote peg and theory of sexuality and in it she talks to the whole point of civilization. Like the whole point was to lift us up from having to dude from being obligated to do things we don't want to do. You know, like we don't need to worry about like what is natural and what's not natural because we've had this very elaborate creation we've made.

Speaker 4:          01:26:31       We don't need to treat our own raw sewage. A lot of us don't fix our own car. We don't build our own home. So for me to sit here and say like, Oh, you're not a man if you don't kill your own food. I can't really say that anymore because there's a lot of things that go into my existence that I'm not doing. You know, there's, there's like I'm being supported by all these things we've created, but in this one area I do choose to still do that. And it gives me a connection into a much broader world. I was going to make another point earlier by camera. What the hell is gonna talk about? Oh my Waco deer hunt story. It's not that great of a story. It's not that great. Well, kind of hunting with Ted [inaudible] who was a cannon. So I was not near Waco and, and, and I was just like the guests, I was actually visiting and I want to be in that they have, they're like, oh, we'll have Bob over the neighbor.

Speaker 4:          01:27:17       Bob. Bob Likes to hunt you and Bob can talk. Bob escaped from the camp. Remember back when they burned it. So tell him how he got out. All right. Shot my shelf. I'll fed. So Bob tells me we'll, we'll go hunting in the morning and Bob takes me out and we drive out into the dark on this farm and Waco and he tells me, he dropped me off at this ladder stand, which is like a plant, like a prison guard platform. Then you climb up in there and he tells me that feeders or kick on at seven. And I honestly, I was so naive at the planet and he know what this meant, but, but he has an automatic feeder, so the animals just worn out. It spits corn out at seven. How do you feel about that? About people planting food? That's of course the same thing.

Speaker 4:          01:27:56       Right? Well, that he see, I could tell that you're like, uh, you're, you're, you're a professional interviewer because I'm not even, this is the first time we were near Hobby interview because you're, you're, you're, you're narrowing your questions down in such a fine point. Where within the hunting world, let me fix my Waco story. The don't forget what you just asked me. No, well it's, it's, you're saying that the feeders, come on, we'll get the kick on at seven at 6:55 AM dear start coming out of the woods in converging on the thing for the seven o'clock feed session. Oh my God. I said to myself at that, at that moment, I said, I cannot, I will not kill a deer under these circumstances. Wow. So I want to killed every one of those dumb fucks. But it's driven by, it's like it to me violated a sort of packed.

Speaker 4:          01:28:52       I understand. Do you understand? Yeah, no, totally. I'm on now. When you ask about planning food, you're going to need an interesting thing because a thing in hunting used to be, there used to be a lot more, she's a lot more one thing in a do you just take bait out and put it in a feeder and dump it in the woods. Right. And in some places that it's illegal someplaces it's frowned on. In some places it's legal and perfectly acceptable. Depends on culturally how people do things. Where you're from. Another version of that is that you just have honest to goodness agricultural lands. So that would be, that was a cornfield that there where they raise corn to sell and to market and deer are drawn to this and you go and sit on the edge of this cornfield and hunt deer. And so a lot of guys that might do that, they might sit like an apple orchard or an Alfalfa field or on the edge of the cornfield and they would say, oh, I don't agree with baiting dear the way you do it where you just don't the corn in the woods, but me sitting on a Cornfield as legitimate.

Speaker 4:          01:29:49       Oh I see. I've watched a hunting shows where they show you how to grow crops that are going to attract this and this broad on in some areas where they banned like maybe it's illegal bait, it's illegal to donate to have a big machine. It just unloads corn. Then is you plant a like pho agricultural crop call a food plot and you might plan it with no intent to harvest, but you plan it. So you plan a little Alfalfa patch and animals come on and it winds up being just as bad. No, no, I'm not saying that as it being, it's like a grain. It grays, the area of what? So in the hunt, in the hunting community of, of people who are think about these things and they're always weighing like, how can we continue to have a sustainable relationship with our resources in light of changing technologies the same way it becomes really difficult to interpret the constitution because we look at it like, okay, you know, right to bear arms, but did that mean you can have a howitzer?

Speaker 4:          01:30:47       You know? So we're always like going like, things have changed. So now what do we do in hunting or eyes looking at these things that change. Like people just hadn't fought. I mean, people had historically, but it wasn't widespread practice to grow bait out in the woods and now it isn't. So it becomes a debate, like how do we, how do you feel about that? How about you don't, you're not for the planters, you know, for the food that just dumps it out at any given time. Whatever you call it. Not, not for it. It's not appealing to me. Like that's not how, that's not how I like to hunt. Yeah. It's the same thing as if I fishy in bucket. I, yeah. Again, I would never say I would never advocate that it'd be abolished because we control, like we have ways that we regulate honeymoon, regulate hunting through season length through how many harvests tickets are allowed.

Speaker 4:          01:31:34       But there's a plane way that we can control harvest. So as long as a group of people aren't, you know, damaging a resource irreparably, I'm not going to then go and say like, Oh, you should do this way and the way I hunt. Right. And the way you hunts wrong. But it has to be the kind of hunting that's most rewarding to me and that I spend my time doing is I like to hunt bigger tracks of land, more physically grueling hunts. I like to be. Why are more where it brings more of an immersion into a wilderness setting where it really draws on more skills on my part where I feel more um, engrossed. I like to get, like, I feel like I'm really hunting when I get to a point where no other thought invades my mind. Okay. If I could get into a situation where I'm not being like, oh, I forgot to call my mom again, you know, I should really call my mom next Sunday. Like when I can get away from any thought and I'm just strictly doing that.

Speaker 5:          01:32:32       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:32:33       That's what I feel. Right. You know? And so that's Kinda like what I'm pursuing in really. I'll go through, you know, when I'm home. So if I'm not traveling a lot and I'm home, I'll eat, you know, pound or more game meat. My wife eats slightly less than that per day. If I'm cooking dinner for her, um, you know, we'll go through my, I give a lot of way. So when I go into my year, I'm always looking at what I can really go through. Well, how much meat can I actually can? How much do you eat from a supermarket? I don't, well, from a supermarket, I don't eat any meat. I'll eat meat in restaurants. I eat in restaurants, but I would never buy meat in the supermarket and bring it into my house. Wow. Nah, we just, he gave me but I have like tons of great gaming.

Speaker 4:          01:33:15       I know how to handle it well. So that's what we eat. How long does it stay? Good. I'll usually on the long end I will keep me in my deep freezer for one year. I don't let things go longer one year cause I generally practice a, was it last in first out. So the, the animals are harvested this year, September, October, November, hunting seasons. I don't get into those until I've finished last year stuff. So when I get into the, to the mid summer I might give away a lot of game meat. You know, maybe I'll give away 40 pounds or 50 pounds a game, eat to friends. I know who use it well cause then I'm trying to clear out my stores knowing that I'm going to be coming into a new season of a lot more. But, but the reason I brought this up was it, there's a finite amount that I need the non abuse. So if I know that I can achieve that goal, which is my primary goal, to build a feed myself on game me, then I, then I start thinking about the quality of those hunts. Do you know what I'm saying? Like if you told me you could go to location a and kill an elk in an hour or you could go to location B and work your ass off and kill an elk in 10 days,

Speaker 4:          01:34:30       this is going to sound like I'm, I'm telling you bs about really would pick B. That doesn't sound like bs at all because I'd be like, well that sounds like an amazing, that sounds like an amazing trip and I'm going to come out of it with stories and things that happened and I still will wind up with my, you know, 150 200 pounds, 300 pounds depending on the size of the elk, elk meat that I know I'm going to use. So I just get more, you know, how much does it affect the flavor of the animal when you freeze it, not adverse. There's a lot of misconceptions about freeze and meat.

Speaker 4:          01:35:02       Meet. We'll hear from her. The term of aging. Yes you meet will still age in a freezer, not still meet, will age and freeze it like there's some breakdown and the breakdown of me is particularly obvious when you look at the way fat because fat will actually in a longterm it'll rot in the freezer. If you take a really fat, like you take, let's say you take a pork chop and it's got a big band of fat on it, you put that thing in your freezer for a year. When you pull it out, that band of fat is going to have, it's going to probably have yellowed. It might even smell rancid. Even those in the freezer and the meat would be fine. So when I put games and game meat fat, like on the Deere family particularly, we call it tallow. It's a difference, a very waxy.

Speaker 4:          01:35:43       It's a different kind of fat. That stuff really does not do well in a freezer and it's not even good fresh. It has a very low melt point. So Hi Mel points. So when you eat it, you take a hot piece and eat it. It solidifies in your mouth, like coats your roof, your mouth with that wax and kind of stuff. People just generally to trim it off. If I take a good piece of meat and trim it and put it in my freezer or a year or I took a piece and trend to put in my freezer three months and I gave you a Pepsi challenge between three months and 12 months. There's no way you'd pick, there's no way you'd pick it out. That's in a deep freeze. And that's, and I wrap all my games, very care. If I do a very tight layer of plastic wrap, squeeze all the air and like get it really good.

Speaker 4:          01:36:24       And then I do it in wax freezer paper and then I keep it in a freezer at a low setting. So you'd, is it a vacuum seal? No, I don't. I don't like those. How come? Because the bags get punctured. If you know that everyone's going to be wearing like velvet gloves and no one's going to be moving this stuff around, they're great. But even, but those bags is rubbing against each other or someone's like carelessly. You know how when you're rummaging through your freezer and looking for something to rummage through your fridge, look in the phone, you puncture those bags in the bag, relies on the seal so the minute you puncture it you wait a while later and you just have like a big loose bag full of ice crystals and freezer burned stuff. It just isn't like archival the way I want it to be.

Speaker 4:          01:37:03       And I've dinked around with different packaging like that. Have you tried double layers, like the vacuum seal and then yeah, it's just, and like for speed issues, if I had a way that they didn't ever get punctured, I would use them more. But for me I just, even when I've had them work, I just haven't seen that for the way I handle it in the way I go through it and the way I store it and what I store. I have not seen that it works any better even when it's perfect. It doesn't work any better than how I like to wrap it. And the way I like to wrap it definitely works better in the long run cause it doesn't wind up getting punctured and full ice crystals. How long have you been living like this?

Speaker 8:          01:37:40       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:37:41       you know, I grew up like my father was a big hunter and we grew up doing a lot of hunting and fishing. I started fishing when I was, you know, three or four. I started hunting at seven or eight years old, killed my first deer and I was 13 and started hunting deer and I was 11. We always ate a lot of deer meat, but we have, we didn't live a conscientious, we hadn't made a conscientious decision to just eat game. We just, we had a lot of it and ate a lot of it but, but we didn't look at eating that differently than, than eating beef. And you'd go in our freezer anytime you'd find a wide array of meats. When I left home to go to college, I went to college in Sioux St Marie, Michigan, um, w with a lot of phenomenal hunting around Lake Superior State University.

Speaker 4:          01:38:20       And we were all very, like my friends. And I were very skilled, pretty seasoned hunters by that point. And we were broke the way you are when you go to college. And we found that we could, uh, just kill deer and eat them and we would buy, we would eat. I remember me and my two roommates, we went through four deer between October one in the beginning of Christmas break. So wow. So like December 15th, October one to seven for dear parties at your house. We, our mantra was burgers for lunch, steaks for dinner. I mean, we're burgers, we would just eat. Yeah. We eat ground meat at lunch and we fished a lot of salmon, right. Because the Saint Mary's river is falls right through town. We'd fish salmon out of that. And that was the first time that I, that I started to live that way. And I mean, and I began to live that way just as out of necessity.

Speaker 4:          01:39:09       But then necessity dovetailed or like blended very quickly into a lifestyle choice. Like one month into that or let's say that first year we did that. So December 15th, um, you know, we finished that fourth year. At that point if you, if you had, you know, like of God had come down and giving me $1 million, a lot of things would've changed. Diet would not have changed at that. I fell so in love so quickly with that, just like very deliberate style and we have, you know, as humans, like you alluded this tour to this earlier where we have a lot of energy and a lot of physical attributes and physical skills that we just don't need to use anymore because the things we've done and it makes me very happy and feel very fulfilled just to do that. And I'm not and I don't like go out and say it that it would do the same thing to you. Like I don't like to be where I don't like the sound or be in a position where I'm telling people where I'm advocating to people like, Oh, if you're unhappy you'll find tremendous happiness by hunting. I'm just saying for me it was, it changed my life and gave me a sense of, of purpose and fulfillment that is matched now only buy like professional things and my family things. It's on that level for me. So I've just lived that way since then. Whoa.

Speaker 1:          01:40:22       Ever watched any of the vice stuff? vice.com and read any of their magazines or any of that stuff? No, there's a company called vice know. I have one other out, cause my agent represents the author who published a device. They, they put out some wild shit and one of them was called Heimos Arctic refuge and Hyman. Yeah. He lives in the upper right. There's a whole, but there's a book about him too though. Is it really? Yeah. There's a book about him. Well, hi Mo. I can't remember his last year. Couth yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. They followed this dude up in, uh,

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       you know he's in like North East Alaska, right? Yeah. They did this after this book came out. It's a phenomenal book, man. Really? Well, he's, he's an amazing cat man. It's a, this guy is just walking around out there. He doesn't have a car. He doesn't have, I mean he's got a little hot, which is, you know, something that he has built. Oh, it's basically a log house. He traps for the third markets. He traps and he shoots Caribou and he fishes and you know, and he's, he's a very smart guy. He's not an idiot, you know, he said he's never around much people be, could be besides his wife, but he was talking about how he believes that, you know, he's a very, he's a, he's really happy and he thinks that this is how a man is supposed to live. The man is supposed to live a, a hunter gatherer existence and then there's a genetic connection.

Speaker 3:          01:41:40       May Be even he was insinuating that this is like, it's something in our DNA that satisfied at a living like that. And most people that are depressed and most people that are, that are bummed out and they live in a a really unfulfilling life. I mean, think about what they're doing. And W W you're, your body's set up to get all these sort of biological rewards from sex, from acquiring food, from a acquiring, physical success, whatever the, whatever it is that it's difficult to acquire, your body gets these rewards. If all the sudden you're in a cubicle and every day it's just the same stupid shit. There's no rewards, there's no nothing, there's no, none of those biological needs, those holes and those holes are filled in. You know, we've, we've really created a very, very strange society that, uh, very few people have been able to navigate successfully. It's almost like we've got this really complicated thing that we have to run, but with no handbook. And so almost everyone's doing it wrong, you know, and almost everyone's doing it wrong for the, for the human body.

Speaker 4:          01:42:36       Your windup was surprise things too. Like the other night before I came here, we were trying, my wife and our busily trying to find sources of drafts in our home because we had a good cold snap. And you know, we have like a lot of obligations and somewhat complicated lives and a lot of things we're trying to do. But we spent the entire afternoon blocking up drafts as we were because like that night after blocking up drafts there was kind of like this or of happiness and be kind of like got along in a different way than we normally get along having like accomplish this, this issue of maintaining our homes and like she'd be warm. It was like we kind of like just got launched into this. This is something that was like just like older and different, you know, and, and it's interesting you bring up the, the, the guy that makes his living as a fur trapper, you know, gets his cash income from, for traffic.

Speaker 4:          01:43:30       Because when I trapped for it really made me, I became kind of miserable trapping for because I got into for trapping at a time when for prices were pretty high. Okay. Look for prices in the late 1970s were really high just for a lot of reasons, but basically coincidentally for fashionable and a bunch of different places. What animals are you talking about? Oh, like what would be like traditional fur bearing animals in North America would be on the, on the smaller side would be urban and weasels and muskrats. And on the bigger side would be links in wolf and an in between that you have may have things like me, wolf, raccoon, Fox, cow. I've never tracked wolf, but what I used to trap me personally, I would trap Muskrat, mink, raccoon, Fox, coyote, beaver, Otter. I'd skin and sell some possums. I'd skin cell, some skunks. Now when I got into a trap and I sat in my first trap in 1984 and you could sell a Muskrat for five or $6 and I could mow a lawn for five or six bucks. So it was obviously great. The from argus only went downhill from there. And by the time the mid nineties came around,

Speaker 6:          01:44:42       mmm.

Speaker 4:          01:44:44       It was hard to make any money trapping. And I realized that I would go out and like one year, I remember it was the second last year ever trapped. I remember I had the end of the year, I had 250 muskrats, 52 raccoons, 13 beavers, you know, and I'm looking at this big pile of things that I went out and harvested and worked my ass off to get. And the value of all this stuff wasn't set by me. The value of all this stuff was set by factors that I couldn't even begin to understand the economic climate and China, um, weather trends. It would be that at the time women in Italy would buy a fur coat that weighed as much as 13 pounds. Women in Asia wouldn't buy for fur coat the weight anymore, nine pounds. So like southern raccoons, which had a lighter hide. We're bringing a lot more than northern raccoons even though they were less good quality because there's a more of a demand and you wind up looking at all this animal life, all those wildlife and wilderness life. And we're trying to like set, you know what it's worth. And I didn't have any control over what it was worth.

Speaker 4:          01:45:52       And it felt in some ways like to when I later discovered more like does hunting for food cause I started hunting for food or after I quit trapping for money and when I hunt for food it's like I set the value. It was a non-negotiable value to me. You know, if I killed a squirrel it was a meal, you know what I mean? It was, there was that it was a meal. There was no money involved in it. Did it bother you? The idea of killing animals as a commodity? Did it feel like ethical? It didn't feel so much unethical. Diesel good. Yeah. It didn't feel good because I didn't like the idea that all these values were set by other things I didn't understand. And I also didn't like why is that? If you look at, let's say a trap me and I know that that makes gonna wind up in Italy somewhere.

Speaker 4:          01:46:37       It just winds up being like, it feels to me like here I am like catching this mink and there's, and, and for me to see the ultimate product is just so diffused. It's so far away, you know, it's like some in Italy and might buy this coat, I'll get $22 for the mink. It wound up being that I just, it stopped being fun for me because I felt too much like that everything was out of my control. The business I'm in now. Hold on a second before I let you go any further, I, you're really confusing me. I'm not sure I understand why you're, you're fixated on this idea that you don't control how much it's worth. You know, that that's what was frustrating about it. Um, when you, when you talk about animals and like hunting and you know, this ethical hunting thing did, did it bother you at all?

Speaker 4:          01:47:21       Do you just setting these traps and these animals are just walking in and you're just selling their furs? I Dunno, that never bugged him in a way. Like one thing that bugged me only in retrospect because you know you skills come before ethics in life. Like I knew how to trap muskrats before I learned to think about you were young. How young were you when you started in the last time trap muskrats. So I didn't know. So it was just a party. You're looking back on it now looking back on it now, there's a couple things that I did that bother me. Is that about how the animals died? No, it would be that some, some violate like some violations of the law that did like where you could catch otters north of a certain line. Okay. I would catch otter south of that line and in lie about where I caught him and the reason you weren't supposed to catch himself that line is because there's a reintroduction effort and daughters didn't have a population that could support it.

Speaker 4:          01:48:19       But in this pursuit of trying to like make money trapping, I found myself doing things to make money that were unethical. Yeah. And no one was forcing me to do this. This is things that I was doing. Also in trapping, you wind up generating an enormous amount of, of, of, of, of waste of flesh. When you tapping these animals with a dying instantly, most of them or how long does it take before they die? Things are dying quickly. The water species die quick. Anything near water is good. Die Quick cause you so your rig it to die. So like if I'm setting for Moss grads, they get something called a body gripping trap. The body group and trap in and of itself is lethal in, it'll kill it. A matter of minutes or less. A body gripping traps set underwater to things dead essentially. Instantly.

Speaker 4:          01:49:05       It's rounds. Yeah. I mean it was given a mat. It'd be like if I took a, if you were already underwater and I like somehow hit you with a truck underwater, did you drown into the truck hit you? So these are professional and constructive traps. Oh yeah. Steel traps. So then we, are you still cool with those today? Is that, I mean how do you feel about that today? I've done. I've done trap and as recently as a year and a half ago, trapping with beaver with body gripping traps and snares. You, but you have a problem with feeders for deer. No, I don't have a problem with fetus for deer. It doesn't appeal to me to hunt that way, but it doesn't bother you. Trapping. Trapping is a difference. I rarely trap, but when you do, it's of a pragmatic sort of as focus. Yeah, like if, if that's the best way to follow the trap beaver now I would like for instance, the beavers I've trapped most recently I had pillows and a hat made out of the hides and I ate the meat. You ate the beaver? Yeah. Wow. What the fuck is beaver tastes like? You know? Honestly, if you, if you don't, if you don't get now there, there are herbivorous man, but yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:50:11       Gotcha. It's such, it's such low harden. It's such low hanging fruit. It's like one of the things, like whenever the subject of beaver trap and comes up, it's such low hanging fruit to southern vagina. Joan has to go for it. Imagine now having discuss beaver trapping for the last 20 years. There's no beaver anymore, by the way. That shit, if you find a beaver, that shit's bad. That's a girl's not shaving it, getting it grows. Keep it up with the times. You can't call that a beaver, you know, you call it a hipsters go t at the most. That's the most you'll tolerate. You're not going to tolerate a beaver or Kale. Um, so, uh, on the show we were talking about this really what you alluded to it and we said we're going to get back to, we didn't, you trapped a beaver and one of your, uh, one of those living like all these other people live.

Speaker 4:          01:50:58       You were up in Canada. Yeah. We're just body gripper traps. Is that was, that was the same type of trend. That's an instant kill trap. And then you, uh, you eat the beaver and you eat the tail, Huh? Yeah. If you don't, beaver has cast or glands and at times the, the cast or gland, it has been more valuable than, than to be retired as a caster. Glen, there's two glands that sit on either side of their vent, like basically where if your kidneys were not against your back, and they were kind of upfront, it almost be like the same scale. It's like how, how big a caster. Glen is just a, it's a pasty substance that they secrete and it's like a calling carpets. Very sweet. You've never smelled anything in the wild that smells like beaver caster and people used to use it for perfumes now that you oh yeah, it's, it's, it's gorgeous.

Speaker 4:          01:51:45       It's a gorgeous smell. They would add it to perfumes they had, they would add it to various pharmaceuticals in the old days. Now a lot of beaver cast or goes into making beaver Lewer because to take a beaver from one pond and go to another pond and put his caster out beavers in that ponder and get pissed and they're gonna want to kill that beaver. Really? Yeah. It's like, it's a calling card. So it's just a kind of a way of saying like it's kind of way of saying fuck you almost for like a beaver to go into a new area. Like he migrates up stream, he gets to a new pond, he's going to lay down, he's going to build up a little pile of mud and secrete some his gland on there and he's saying like, I'm in town. Wow. Deal with it. I'm here.

Speaker 4:          01:52:22       So the big beaver market for castor glands is artificially doing that to get the beavers pissed off. A lot of beaver caster will get sold into making lewers for a variety of species. It's beaver like skunk essence winds up being a deterrent? No, no. A lot of animals at at small doses. A lot of animals are curious about the smell of skunk. Really. If you take beaver caster and this, it doesn't need be at low doses, but beaver cast or is appealing. So you'll trap. I used to take casters from the beavers. I caught an hour. Would Adam and lure that I'd use for coyote, I'd add them in lieu or that I used for Fox. I'd add him in the, or use for raccoon addendum and all that kind of lure in various quantities because it's just, it's a seductive smell that just seems to be universally appealing.

Speaker 4:          01:53:08       Wow. And what is the or the animals attracted because they think they're going to eat the, the, the beavers glands or is it just a smell? I think it draws, I think a number of things are going on curiosity. Um, and, and perhaps it just has a, like the way fish who've never seen a worm will eat worms. There's certain things that just speak to you like on an olfactory and visual sense. If for some reason beaver caster lewers in a wide variety of animals. Now when you say you know, Louis for Fox or Lewis for different animals, how do you, you have, you couldn't construct these yourself? Yeah, like for instance, I used to take a house cat meat. Okay, but because you kill a cat. No, here's it's a law now you have to promise you. You're, let me tell you, let me explain everything so far.

Speaker 4:          01:53:56       Yeah, you have no, nothing's been too crazy. Dairy farmers will keep house cats. They dairy farmers like to have a lot of cats around a control mice populations. Okay. So they want plenty of cats. You get to have too many cats because they're not, they're not the, they're came catch. These casts are essentially Farrell. The hang around a farming operation. You get too many and they start, they'll transmit diseases back and forth talking to new plasma and you wind up with no cats. So when a dairy farmer in my area would get to be where he had way too many cats, he would like, I used to go out and shoot the cats on a bounty. Wow. So I would shoot cats for five bucks or 10 bucks or whatever because they would want to trim back. They'd be like, we got to, I have to get rid of 50% of these cats are, I'm gonna have problems.

Speaker 4:          01:54:43       Wow. So the cats are only existing on these mice or are they giving them food as well? No, the guys, they'll definitely put feed out. They'll get food out and they role of wild. And the other thing is from like, if you imagine these farmyards as being like a little nexus of, of cat stuff, you'll wind up with feral cats spinning off of that and they can have a dramatically negative impact on like ground nesting birds and things. So beyond shooting cats around a farm, it's common practice in agricultural areas to kill cats. That goal certifiably feral because we're looking at them as being competition. Like we want to have, you know, pheasant or grouse or to have around and the cats like, uh, a non-natural competitor. And so in the, in the great spirit of all predators, the same way a wolf will kill a coyote and a Cowlick Hill Fox will a cat.

Speaker 4:          01:55:37       Now you're saying this very pragmatically, but please don't. Yeah, but I used to, when I was making bait, I would get the cats that I would use when I was doing control work for a dairy farmer. And I would take the cat and I would bone out the back hams and I would take the out the back hams mean their legs. I would take the meat off the back legs. No bones. Okay. Would up in the morning copycat ham, I would put that in a in a, in a one quart mason jar, one quart glass jar and now bury that in the sand somewhere where it was like pretty cool. So I had a controlled temperature cause I don't want to put, I couldn't put my mom's fridge so I'd buried that coffee down the sand. I'd leave it there for about a week and it would be, it would become what we would call tint tainted.

Speaker 4:          01:56:19       Not like taint lake, you know, 10 you're asking your balls, but like it would become slightly rotted at that. Once it got to be the perfect kind of rotten, like a little bit tainted, I would add glycerin to it, like a preservative to halt the rock. Then I would add in small amounts of other stuff like output, put pulverized. I would take beaver caster and mince it up in a mortar and pestle and add some beaver caster into it. I might add a little bit of fish oil into it. I might add like glands from a Red Fox into it. Is this is all common trappers are, no, no, no. There's not all travelers, but some trappers, there's recipes for this. Do they sell this stuff like a Nordic versions or type in type in trapping louvers on your deal there. My head sets wigging out. Yeah, mine is too Brian.

Speaker 4:          01:57:09       This thing keeps fucking up. The sound on this thing is a mess. That's why I keep grabbing it. You're your connections off somehow or another. So an ounce, a trapping Lou are usually sells for five or six bucks for an ounce, seven 50 maybe for an ounce. And so I would make my lures this way and I would then use these lures to lure and animals in, in, you know, to lure and Fox and stuff. Other stuff. I would just use a piece of stuff like all summer out. If I was flying fish to eat, I would just save the heads and use the heads for mink. Just that simple, just a piece of a fish head. All those stuff. You have to be more complicated. Like a Fox is probably his giant not going to be hungry enough. He's not just going to come in for a piece of rotten meat.

Speaker 4:          01:57:47       There's gotta be something. It's like says to him like what, what in the world? What in the world could that be now? What do you say to, I mean you're, you're saying this all very pragmatic. Obviously you grew up this way and this is, you know, just part of life and it makes sense to me. I have no arguments with it, but a lot of people would submit for shooting cats. A lot of people would be like, you know, you fucking piece of shit out there shooting cats. Like that's a weird conversation to it is man. And I know and the only way to treat it like don't think for a second that I don't recognize that that's like something that would, would potentially curl someone's hair. You know, it's going to get their attention. But there's no other real way for me to discuss it because at the time that it was occurring, it was just a matter of fact thing that happened.

Speaker 4:          01:58:35       And still now if I would never, like we bring, I don't know, I can't remember how many million, 37 million. I don't know how million cats get euthanized in humane society facilities in various facilities around the country year in another. We're fine with that. Yeah, it's in the millions. So your, so if you have a dairy farmer and he just gets to a point where he has cats as part of his business and is part of it, you just enjoys them around and he gets to a point where he has to get rid of some that there's sickness spreading among them. I just don't really know that he's being that absurd or that unethical did he has someone come out and put them down with a firearm? I mean it's like as much as I recognize that, that it's so far removed from what most people are familiar with.

Speaker 4:          01:59:20       It was just something that happened. It was something I did and it's not something that I in any way feel like I should apologize for because looking back on it, it's probably still going on right now. There's probably, there's like a guy who can't have that many cats running around. Well not only that, I mean cats, cats do transmit a lot of fucking diseases, especially feral cats, feral cats or that can be dangerous to your actual humans and especially babies, you know the cat diseases. Like that's the reason why they tell women not to fuck with litter when you're pregnant again. And also like my kid has a sandbox and we got it covered up to keep cats of it. So you know, I get all that. And Dirty Brooklyn cats. It's just something, yeah, it's just something I know you can imagine what they are.

Speaker 4:          02:00:00       All Brooklyn cats must be fucking terrifying. So the other thing is, is still like if I was out now, like if I'm out now, I don't have happy feelings toward a feral cat who's out living as a Predator on the area. I don't feel that way about a feral cat that I would feel about a native Redd Foxx. I see her date of Redd Foxx. I feel blessed to have seen it because I'm seeing some like cool animals. Yeah. Like some part of a living landscape. You know, if I see a cat I'm like oh there's some thing that we sort of through our own stupidity have just yet one more thing that we've thrust upon their assholes thrust upon the environment. Cause cause you can't snuggle them. You can't call him, you can't go and pet up feral cat, they don't protect you up.

Speaker 4:          02:00:44       They don't pursue it a little, scratch it. So no, I don't have a lot of things. But yeah of course it's a outlandish thing and I'll sometimes do outlandish things and half of the reason we were to another that we talked the night, it's like I went to Vietnam and did a magazine story about, about eating dog meat, you know, and I eat dog meet seven nights in a row. Whoa. Largely yes. When I went there honestly I was curious about why do people eat dog meat at the end of the lunar year? It's like considered a lucky food and auspicious food and it's cultural. Nothing, not so fucking lucky. And I will say they might want to try to do trinkets. So dog, but party wanted to go there just because I knew that it would like that. It would like raise people's hackles, raised my raise, my hackles. I didn't, I didn't enjoy it. But have your tastes do things. I couldn't tell you man. I never enjoyed a bite of it. I it seven nights in row and I could never get over the moral. I couldn't ever get over the it and then I wished that I was man enough or like, like collected mentally enough to get over it and just enjoy it. But I could never get beyond.

Speaker 1:          02:01:42       So you were sick every time he ate my wife, my wife's with me, she came out to cheat it. Oh yeah. She never liked it. My brother Dan, he was with me. He never liked it. Wow. None of us could get past it. Dogs are too cool, man. There's a deal that they've made. But then again, feral dogs, man, there was a problem in Georgia recently. A, an elderly couple was attacked and killed by feral dogs. Really? Yeah. They're getting, they're getting problems in places where you have large populations of feral dogs. And get together as packs, you know, meeting people killed by dogs. Man. It's not, it's not a, if it grows wild out there, it's a wild animal. I mean it's that quick. It makes the jump. Yeah, fair. Like the whole, the whole feral issue too, like fascinating feral pigs and they change the morph as feral pigs, things playing that cause a lot of people don't even know.

Speaker 4:          02:02:30       Point feral pigs are probably might be recognized. I mean in some places they are recognized as they're like here now. But no, I mean we have feral two types of feral pigs historically that came in the US. Do you have farm pigs that people brought here? You know, just the very early stages of our national development. People bring like agricultural breeds of pigs and rather than feeding them you'd kind of let them wander around and he'd go out and forage and eat acorns one not. And when you want him to go shoot them and inevitably there's a certain amount of loss. Like some of them don't come back and they go off into the hinterlands and make their own way. So then that's like a d escaped domestic like on this feral. Another thing we have here in the u s in some places where people actually took the, like all like pigs historically are descendants of Eurasian wild boar.

Speaker 4:          02:03:19       So domestic breeds were spun off of this species of, of, of forest forest dwelling pig lives in Europe and Asia. The same way like candle came from the oryx but the oryx went extinct. Pigs came from the erasion wild boar with the erasion. Wild boar never went extinct. They still exist. People will now and then get their hands on your Asian wild boars and think this would be sweet if it lived in the woods by my house and they'll take them here and let them go. So you're taking like a wild animal and turning it loose. Wild. This is illegal now, but it, it went on and in a lot of places, you know, in some places you'll have where it's like, that's how you get Hogzilla. No, you get Hogzilla by taking a pig and put into Penn and fattening it up till it's really huge. And then letting it go and shooting it and calling the newspaper and saying, you just shot in 1100 pound wild pig. Really? That's all those, listen, those guys that killed was 1100 pound pigs. Like one guy, I remember it came up and he killed one and a couple days later a guy came out and said, I just sold that guy, that pig.

Speaker 1:          02:04:17       Whoa. But I thought that Hog Zillow has been proven to be half a bore. It's um, yeah, it's your, it's right here. It's a male hybrid. It's a hybrid of a wild hog and domestic pig that was shot and killed and Atlanta, Georgia or excuse me, I'll lap Aha. Georgia on June 17 2004 it mean, I mean it was, but it, it had been feeding on

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       green, but it's a, it's a hybrid. It's half wild boar. But here, so this guy I need to know you need, yeah, there was lying going on but it has like the giant tusks and shit. We need to allow me to finish what I'm saying. Okay. In some places you still have remnants of actual Eurasia and wild pigs in the u s right. In some places you have some area where all the pigs are like a farm breed, but usually in any place that would support one would support other and has had chances to support the other. And so you have like hybrid populations, so where eye on them. In northern California they tend to be black, big toss. Why are you here? They tend to look like a razorback your rage and pig, but at the same time all of a sudden you look in, one will be modeled, he'll have like a white patch on his rump and so you know there's some exchange going on between what you know that when you take a domestic pig and you said it pharaoh, within three weeks they start to change.

Speaker 4:          02:05:30       They metamorphosized they there. They're there for gets thicker and darker. Their tusks grow. There are the only animal that we've ever observed that you let it loose in the wild and it's does physical body changes growing woolly? Yeah. Were you aware of this? They're nose is stretch out. They literally become more work or wow. I've heard they have like they'll go through morphological changes once they, once they changed their habits and I guess that you might look at a person and say the same thing that I liked this man. Look at that motherfucker. I mean come on dude, that was, that was in someone's yard. I don't want to, I don't want to get into, I don't want to get into specifics with you, but if you do a small amount of research on this subject, you're going to find that there is a lot of fuckery.

Speaker 4:          02:06:13       Yeah, there's a lot of bullshit or oh, I was around in the hog Zillow thing. Namely that pigs that are being presented to the press as being wild pigs in fact have a history of being fed artificially. Brion pull up that picture. Well that shit up and put it on Twitter because that is the most ridiculous shit in my life right there. Why don't you just put it up on Youtube? Look at the size of that God damn thing. Look at that. That's a monster, man. There's also, there's also a photography trick called force perspective course. The guys behind the ducting. I get that, but Jesus Christ, that's a, that's a crazy looking fucking unjust to werewolf pig. Listen, I'm not angling this not a huge pig. I'm just saying that you have to fleas. I do lists. I believe you, man. You're so, you're saying that the only way you get a pig like this as if you grow it in captivity, do they grow hybrids in captivity?

Speaker 4:          02:07:01       Is that as well? They do that. They grow up. I know a guy that has pigs, he has hybrid pigs and he sells in the market, so he grows up. There's no looks like nothing against it. They look like this and he gets them all giant and then he shoots him and he left. He does calls the news like that. I think that, I think that what you're looking at is when someone presents, like let's say you raise up a pig that gets to a thousand pounds, that's a feat in and of itself. It's a giant pig to sweeten the deal, one to act like you also shot it hunting. Who by the way, that photo that we just said I should correct myself right now that is actually a wild boar that the guy shot

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       in Europe, so it is a wild boar. It's nothing to do with America. That one animal that we were just looking at because I just googled Hogzilla and that pulled up, which looks very different than this Hogzilla, which is actually a very good point. If you see this is the Hogzilla that was the famous one that uh, a lot of people were saying. We're very different looking at him and hanging out. I think that's the one that had been hanging out eating corn as some kind of fattening facility, very different looking animal. Then the thing that we just saw, which was really a wild monster fucking Werewolf, it looks like a Goddamn Werewolf.

Speaker 4:          02:08:09       They get bit. How did we even get out of the subjective, like a

Speaker 1:          02:08:13       what? Feral pigs? Feral animals. Feral cats. We were talking about that they had a feral cat for a pet. Once they're there. Wild Man. They're not like a writer. You mean? You can't even think of it as a regular cat. You might just have while have a fucking sewer rat as your friend, you know they're feral cats or cranes. They never get it out of their head. We had a, we had a cat named fig. The cat that we found in the wet will be kind of tamed it by putting fish heads out for it and eventually kind attained it, but you never really own that. I had one named Jack Dempsey. He couldn't pick this one of fucker up. He would fucking go crazy and call your face off, but you could go up to him, sneak up on them and prep them a little bit. Who let you pet them? A little bit. Only me. It was only one person that could pet them. The early about this cat food. The cat is, he would go away on long trips. Oh, come back. A week later he come right down to step two feral cats, man. Like do crazy shit

Speaker 4:          02:09:00       steps that led from the road down these long, like kind of like long terrorists steps down to our house by the lake and some of it when he came home he'd come right down to steps. Man, he would walk into grass. He's like he wanting to announce his return and then

Speaker 1:          02:09:12       relax and you'd get geared up for his next trip. I've read about a feral cat that traveled some insane amount of distance, like a thousand miles to reunite with his family. Once they moved, they move at Jay showed up. Now it sounds like it would be, but no, I'm pretty sure it really happened. I'm pretty sure Google that shit. Oh No. I want it. Here's what I was going to get at with feral stuff,

Speaker 4:          02:09:33       and this is a, this is a interesting thing is like you look at in the Hawaiian Hawaiian islands where you have humans, like the Polynesians arrived in Hawaiian that maybe 1100 years ago. Until then there had been no one on those islands. Right. And they brought with them pigs. Yeah. Okay. At this point now we all accept that that's like the native indigenous population of humans. We call them Hawaiians, but places like the Nature Conservancy will get their hands on land there and they want an extra pate. The non native wild pigs, even though the two things arrived together, one's native in, one's a nonnative nuisance and it really draws into question our ideas of, especially now where so much everything we eat essentially is large and imported. I mean important like the seeds are developed and other continents and we have made a real melting pot of, of what's indigenous in endemic to here and what we've all in. And

Speaker 2:          02:10:33       so my perspective on, oh there's a cat, he don't belong here. Bang. The fact that that camp might be standing out in a wheat field, which is non native plant. I don't then look at it and go like, oh, the whole world's cockeyed. I'm just like very selective in what I think should be introduced and what shouldn't be introduced. You know

Speaker 1:          02:10:52       you're engrossed in your Hogzilla sir. No, no. I'm listening to you totally as well. I'm just listening to find out if I'm full of shit about cats traveling to the new houses. Apparently they can't do it. Thousand Miles can find people know it's, you know, there's a bunch of, unfortunately a lot of its urban myth, but how long, but they are saying that it is a really kind of shock. Shocking how, wow. How far they can travel and find people. And there's a bizarre theory about it by this guy named Doctor Rupert Sheldrake. It's about morphic fields and it's actually a very hotly contested, but in, in his eyes, provable that animals know when their parents are coming home, they know when their owners are coming home and that they can sense it. Even if it's a random time during the day. There's very specific things that the dogs do like go towards the door, the door when they could have no idea that the person was anywhere near them.

Speaker 2:          02:11:40       Yeah, I actually see it all the time. I cause I have security systems and like I can watch the recording video maybe five minutes before I get home that dog or in cats would just suddenly kind of wake up and kind of like just look out, like look towards the window and it's like not even like 40 minutes.

Speaker 1:          02:11:58       Sheldrake's idea about it is that there's, there's some other sense that we don't particularly have. There's something that we don't use. We don't need it so we don't detect it. And there's a, there's a field of energy that somehow or another we can detect certain things with and we're just not in tune with it. And one of the best ways of proving this is the one psychic thing that seems to be measurable and that is that people know when people are looking at them and that's a, Oh actually I got to show that statistically measurable that people can tell when people are looking at them. And the idea behind this is there's some, some, some energy that's going out and something that people were tuning in. But you know, we, we poo poo it because it's not a commonplace idea, but what it's, you know, smell crazy as hell.

Speaker 1:          02:12:41       The idea that there's something that you can't see and it comes from us, a cheeseburger and it goes up your nostrils and it's, he's Adams and let you know it's delicious or that it smells like shit and you should leave it alone and run from it. I mean, just try describing what that is, you know, I mean, it's not like arrogant enough to be able to say like, oh no, the world stops right here. Like whatever I'm privy to is the end and nothing else can be privy to anything extra than what I am. I mean, this is kind of a ridiculous notion. Like it's hard. It's impossible to say what kind of trip animals around animals. You see animals do inexplicably things and I don't then wind up turning to like mysticism or like spiritual isn't to explain it when it might just be that they have sensory there. They have like sensory perceptions that are picking up on things that allude me. But you spent a lot of time in Alaska. Um, have you uh, ever heard a legitimate foot story?

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       You ever heard some that make you really think a really weird thing to talk about it? No, it's not what we're doing to talk about and not, not taking a dead, not serious. Okay. No, no. There was no rushing. I does it. Here's the one of the, I mean there's a million reasons why I don't know, a million. It was a handful of reasons why I'm, I'm very suspicious of big for stories and don't believe in big foot and primary. I think about like this

Speaker 4:          02:13:59       if even if you have a very small population, things like think of the Florida panthers, there's a subspecies of the mountain liner. Peugeot, 500 of them live in Florida, right? Yeah. Yeah. Every year. The edit time they were down in the last 50 or 500 no, there's about 50 yeah. Yeah. I got hit by, it was a five. You get hit by cars. Fuck them. No what I'm saying or not. Again, you have so few and you got, they'll get hit by a car, they'll turn up in a guy's yard. It's like you can't hide them. Right. And then you're telling me that we've had over all these hundreds of years, no Harry and the Hendersons moment where a got that we, there's just not like a dead one floats up on the beach. A guy runs one over with a car. It's like you really can't hide animals. You knew that. You take like a handful of wolves and reintroduce them somewhere like Yellowstone national park, the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, one of the wildest sections of our country. You turn a handful of wolves in there. It's not two days later and you know you got one shot, one, some guy ran, went over. It's like things just kind of come out of the woodwork and I don't think that we could have been hiding this giant primate

Speaker 4:          02:15:07       out there without someone hitting it with a car, without having just like you and I know that the older they got like a top of one's head here and to track there and the Yeti. Yeah. It never got an actual physical specimen of a big foot, you know, Mitch Hedberg, uh, he fell as though pictures of big foot weren't blurs, just a big foot was blurred. Yeah, that was a great job. I remember that. Um, less drought had a great big foot story, you know, survivor man, it's fucking, you know, it w he was talking about being up in Alaska completely by himself, hundreds of miles from anything. And he heard, he heard like some crazy primates sound and something small branches. Well he was alone in the dark, you know, in Alaska. But the whole Alaska big foot things brand new. No, it's not now. There's bad.

Speaker 4:          02:15:52       It is. There's been a lot of like BC, Alaska stuff like British Columbia. Yeah. Like British Columbia has got like a big like mean brand new, but like the last 20 years like I don't like, there's not like a, like you don't like native Alaskans don't have an oral history that I know of of big foot's the way magic north Pacific northwest is where it seems that those legends came from, I was like Pacific northwest had an oral history and all of of this occurrence and it was something they discussed and it was, it was part of their mythology and legends and explanations, but now it's like all this big in Michigan's

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       upper peninsula, you know, like every state has its own big foot's. Ohio has big feet. Those it is that the portal and Laskin bigfoot was created by hallmark. Actually the idea, I believe shit man, it really bullshit. The idea would be Alaska. You think? It's not the only reason why I say I leave, I leave everything open. The only reason why I leave everything open all the time, but very rarely why believe in one way or another back door. I know what you're saying and believing that shits on don't get past the velvet rope. I believe in I, there's, you know, you have to, I have to really absolutely know that something's true or not true. And one of the reasons why I think it's a fascinating subject, it's because they know what it actually used to be an animal. There's a thing called the gigantic Pythagoras age. I think that's what it is. I don't think, I think the original big foot was that just some stone guys in the 70s that tried to, you know, take a photo of it. It could have been done. Well, the only reason why that doesn't make sense, because the native Americans have over 250 different names for a large man, hairy ape thing that lives in the woods. If it was an intelligent priming, it could avoid the bolt. But it's the thing that's created

Speaker 4:          02:17:37       again and again, like I was in the Philippines and they're born in the Philippines, out in the jungle. They had a thing like an equivalent beast.

Speaker 1:          02:17:45       I think we all are swaying. It was like the os weighing or ASW a and g and it would like tear you up very various ways. We all have this inherent fear of the unknown and the dark. Just from back in the days when we really hadn't taken an audit of every plant, every animal there was on the earth. And so there was always legends and worries and you know, the North American Indians only had their self to go on and who knows? You know, you see a fucking grizzly bear standing up on its back, feet in the middle of the woods at dusk from a distance and you fucking shit your pants and run away. You could convince yourself, you know, if you were tall storyteller or you know, didn't have the best grasp on reality, you can convince yourself you saw a giant man. So you're seeing things that dark. It's very possible. The only reason why I leave it open and I don't have an opinion. If I had a bet money, I would say there's probably no big foot, but I would be happy if I lost. I'd be like excited are sexy if they would. Actually be elated. And, and you said earlier, like you said, like the reason

Speaker 4:          02:18:39       you find it fascinating, my thinking that, you know, putting my money on the fact that it doesn't exist like very emphatically. Does it then make me think that the idea of it is it fat is fair. I mean the idea of it is

Speaker 1:          02:18:52       fascinating. Hoaxing is so complex. If it is just hoaxing cause they've found dermal ridges on um, on, on footprints, which actually indicate that there's a print, like a fingerprint that's coming off the toe was like, man, if that's all hoaxing it's so elaborate. It's really fascinating. This Green Lane happen,

Speaker 4:          02:19:11       you know, I mean if you spend any amount of time, and again I, I can't like attack specific examples. Like, I'm not, I'm not a quick to do that, but I know that if you spend any amount of time looking at sign animal sign in the woods, evidence of animals in the woods tracks things, they leave a confused record and and things, you know, animals put their feet down a ways and turning things on certain surfaces and do certain things where you wind up with strange tracks and sometimes her and shit like just, and sometimes other sets of circumstances will create things that you would swear it would be prints in the ground or you know. But again, I, I can't like comment a specific examples. I know what you're saying. It's not like, like the, the record of an animal's passing through mud and snow and sand and things.

Speaker 4:          02:20:02       It is often quite confused. It can be very difficult to sort it out and you'll look at something that you swear might be a track and you examine it and then winds up not being attracted to. It could just be a bear and some slippery surface. And the bear puts his paw down in the mud slips and it looks like a giant footprint. It could be something like that. It could be some guys screwing around. Yeah, it could be all the above. Right to be that as well. And if you, you know when you take into account like just Imana hoaxing that goes down with archeological specimens, people have a motivation beyond, it's like whatever kind of money they make off it just to be just to do it. There's a guy like that used to fake retired about early forms of arrowheads. There's like a type of arrowhead, a very old type of Harold had called a full point.

Speaker 4:          02:20:42       There's this guy that was by last name, McCormick spent like devoted his life to like making fake fake Folsom and spinning them off to museums but not even profiting on it. Just like try to be like Douche bags on another one. He just really, and now he was so good that it's now cool if you own a McCormick. It's cool. You really, yeah. It'd be like if you imagine you got made like really great fake Rembrandt's later. People are. I'd be like, it's not a Rembrandt, but it's actually this guy that made some sweet, fake Rembrandts and he became like Banksy, the Banksia Rembrandt's. Who's Banksy? Really? You never heard of that guy? He's a famous graffiti artists. No, no, never heard of the movie called exit through the gift shop. You got to Netflix at one really fascinating, fascinating, very famous, very, very talented graffiti artists.

Speaker 4:          02:21:28       No Man. You know, I'll tell you something about me. When someone tells me to watch a movie, you don't want to watch it? No, I watch it. Really if, unless it's someone telling me like grizzly man, y'all, one of the best isn't one of the greatest movies of all time is one of my favorite documents, but I watched it again the other day, all Herzog stuff. Not all of it, but I didn't like that. The cave one was kind of dry, but I was like, I don't know how you could make a bad move about cave paintings. What? He managed to do it, man, it was really weird. Right? I mean it was like almost like his reverence was annoying. Look at the abuse. I wanted a little more like, I want a little more like, well, so what is up with the cave paintings? Not from your like dream perspective, but can we get like an expert in here to talk about these firms? Yeah, exactly. Well we had a guy in here that was talking about some of the first works of art, you know the first things that men worshiped and then it made sense that the kind of worship these, these buffalo, they withdraw because I was their sustenance, you know, you know, they would, they would have to like live

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       like chasing these, these, these groups of them. And that's how they sustain themselves and that that's when they find this. It's like the first evidence of idolatry. The first evidence of worshiping something. But that was a trip you think about and the cave he's talking about. And what was it that bird bird advances a baseball movie, wasn't it? What was, what's her name? What's the name of the movie? Cave of dreams Cave of forgotten. Oh, the Werner Herzog movies. And we were saying, yeah, it was, I don't remember the name of a cave of forgotten dreams cave of, hold on a second. I'll, I'll, if you draw it. So cave, right? Yeah. You remember. See Dog, why are you looking at it up cave of forgotten dreams. Okay. So how do you know what the Hell is Tom? Oh No. Oh that set back the clock on, on elaborate painting by thousands of years.

Speaker 1:          02:23:15       But I remember reading at one point, something that I even like later summarize this argument in the book is that cave paintings that someone used to have put forth this theory that cave paintings really proliferating at a period when you were seeing that all that megafauna vanishing, you know, all the animals that went extinct the ice age, but like, it seemed that as they were vanishing, people started to replicate them in art. You know, that makes sense. You're seeing the changing of time and you're summoning them in some way. Are they aware of this new discoveries that they've, uh, they've found out that our answers, our ancestors had mastered deep sea fishing 42,000 years ago. They found evidence of tuna, they found tuna bones and they found hooks and lines, whereas that, this is in, I'll tell you right now, East Timor, north of north of Australia, which contains the bones of more than 2,800 fish, some of them were caught as long as 42,000 years ago.

Speaker 1:          02:24:18       Yeah. And this is deep sea fishing. They found the world's or, or earliest recorded fish hook made of Shell and dating from between 23,000 and 16,000 years ago. That's good stuff. That's amazing. So they had, they had been ocean bound, not just, not just like shooting it from the bank, but they went into deep water and somehow or another had enough line to pull a fucking tuna out of hundreds of feet of water like that. They must have made their own twine and they must have, you know, braided it together and made a fucking, you'll know deep sea fishing. You just, cause you're in deep water. I mean, tuner generally fish very near to surface. So there is way the hell out. Oh, I see what you're saying. They're way the hell out catching tuna at the surface. So, okay, so they don't need some, a lot of line man. I mean, you're strong as fuck to get a pull a man. You'd have to play him a little bit. No, no, I'm not. That's an impressive stuff. And I have known now and I like to know that kind of thing. Know this. This was a really recent discovery. This is a date dated November 25th, uh, from the UK mail online and it's, you know, it's got the photographs of it

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       and everything. It's really, really fascinating. The, the site where they found it, it's a, that's a, that's a pretty intense discovery. And there they were always pushing back. I mean, on a regular basis, pushing back the date when people figure things out, moving it back, and then sometimes moving it forward. The thing that gets moved back here is, is we constantly read, are readjusting how long people have been here in North America has come and gone. You know, the one thing that they figured out is that it's really one of the most shocking things is that 10,000 years ago, half of it was covered by over a mile of ice. That's just 10,000 years ago. I mean, that's really amazing when you stop and think about it. Like when my, my home state was drowned, man, I'm sure when you think about people coming here from, from Europe where things have existed in the, in a pretty static state for far, far longer, and people have been there for far for them.

Speaker 4:          02:26:11       When they first came over here, man, there was just, you know, scattered tribes of native Americans. But what a crazy find, you know, this one continent or there's hardly anybody there. I mean, how many Indians were there with her? 1 million over the entire continent. No, I think there are many more, but many more than a million. Yeah, but 90% I mean, you know, it could have been populations at 10 million. Some people even say it's 10 million. That's Miami. Is You lost immediately relevant. I mean, fairly immediate. You lost to infectious disease giant 100% of the population. Wow. So a lot of the time when guys are talking, like when, when you're looking at, you know, like Lewis and Clark or we've talked about them earlier, they come up the Missouri and they come across as like abandoned village. It's like, oh, where'd everybody go? I mean they're all done and they're like, no one's here.

Speaker 4:          02:26:57       And there's all these, you know, there's all those buffalo and no one's hunting them in. It's crazy. But what they don't know, as you know, 40 years earlier, a smallpox epidemic slept through there and just carry it off. 90% of the people. And so because disease would travel faster than individuals. Like you had like what Cabeza de Vaca. He, he was the first guy to kind of walk along the Gulf coast and the early 1500 then there's an absence of people and in, in, in Coronado goes up in air and that amount of time, just massive amounts of people were carried off cause disease always traveled faster than that's taking away from the atrocities that were, you know, purposely committed on native. Like the actual, the actual slaughter of people paled in comparison to the nothing to the disease. I mean disease was like disease. I mean, I mean this is the stuff that I'm, this is the outcome.

Speaker 4:          02:27:47       It was by mean people generally accept the figure is somewhere around 90% of the people were carried off by infectious disease shit. And it's just what you were, they had never hear that because when you pat, when you pass through, so you had very small numbers of individuals passing through very cold climates and the way to come here and they'd just arrived here without infectious disease. They had some stuff, like there's debates about what exact sexually transmitted diseases, they add those dirty bitches, but that's what it was not have, but not having, um, you know, like influenza, all that

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       stuff we just left behind. And it's amazing. And it's what we were talking about earlier, how you go to a new place and you drink the water and everyone else, there's norm. It's normal to them. They're used to it. They've developed an immunity to it and the ones that can't hack it died a long time ago. But it's incredible when you think about the timeframe that this entire continent was covered in ice than the ice thaws out. Some people are there, then new ones come in boats. Then the whole thing fucking changes. And it's like, what a short amount of time. I mean, what an amazingly short amount of time to just completely transform an entire continent. That's one of the reasons I'm interested in deep history here. Um, as, I mean, besides the fact that I live here, but it's, it's more, it's easier to grasp because things happened like, like Africa. You can't even begin to get your head around human history in Africa. It's monkeys because there was no, to turn into a smarter must know beginning point, it wasn't being like, I don't know at what point do we call it Lucy it, when is it a human here? It's like no one day, right?

Speaker 4:          02:29:20       One day, not long ago in a historical sense. Uh, dude and his wife and his family step foot on this thing and enables

Speaker 1:          02:29:31       and they found and this and then rate the pill is just breaking them away. The, you know, a lot of people have these nostalgic ideas about what the settlers did, but if you read some of the accounts from, from what Columbus is, people did, they did horrific, horrific things to the native Americans that were here. It's a, it's amazing how horrific things of that. I mean, it's like each other. Well, the Lakota, Lakota people were not known as Lakota people that are known as the Su Su. It means enemy. That's what they called them. Everybody. They called themselves a Lakota people, but the other Indians that they would rape and murder, they called them sue. Yeah, they weren't, they weren't, I mean they were living a pure existence in the sense of they were living off the land. They killed a buffalo. They used every single part of that, that Buffalo, they date. There was no waste tribal. That's a hotly contested thing, is it really? Well, I think wasn't their ethics in that wasn't there, that happened at times. Uh, I say fine.

Speaker 4:          02:30:25       Where you'll find like digs at cliff's sites where they might've run 800 animals off a cliff and they find that the only, the only like, you know, a dozen of the carcasses wherever just articulated, ever caught up. Well,

Speaker 1:          02:30:40       might be one of those situations where he got to do what you gotta do, chasing a bunch of Buffalo. It was off the cliff. It wasn't a, it wasn't a crime like weight. And there's a lot of things like that.

Speaker 4:          02:30:49       I remember outside of this fort and South Dakota one time they killed 1300, just cut the tongue's out. Wow. But why? To sell them tongues, you're worth a lot of money. You get, I at a time you get like a buck form. They traded him for bat for whiskey and drank it and Jesus Christ, I left the hides and we left and left everything. But there's two things going on there. One, there was already a corruption of, of alcohol and almost like a purposeful giving, like a purposeful addiction to people by like trading alcohol and do. Um, they're, the ones going on is when people were wasting those huge Mazda animals. Like we now think of it as waste, but they did probably didn't even have a concept of finiteness. Right. It was like they had no idea we could run something. Yeah, you like use, you treat it with respect by using what you need at that given time. And if you follow this very elaborate set of codes and taboos in, in, in, in practices, you have your certain that you'll be able to live this lifestyle into perpetuity. And if that means that if you one day kill a buffalo to celebrate and you just cut out its tongue and its liver and you have a celebration and walk off the next day, it wasn't that you just committed a crime.

Speaker 1:          02:31:58       I see. And by the way, that is going to get eaten by other animals and bacteria and nature's can absorb it back into the earth.

Speaker 4:          02:32:04       But you're right, like what you brought up is there is this tendency to really celebrate these things and, and it, it frustrates me now when people act like that, we've, like, we as people are, have become so violent now and it's like violence touches a smaller percentage of our lives now than ever. The fact that you can get to be that, I know people who've gotten to be in their late thirties have never laid eyes on a dead person.

Speaker 1:          02:32:28       Yeah. Would have been impossible. It's like unheard of and they must not have email, right. There's no way they have an internet connection and never even looked at someone's going to send them some dead people. You can just look it up and just send them to you, man. People, if you have friends, hey, check out this guy, they're going to send it ups and they're gonna send you a video of a dude getting run over by a truck or something. But I see the easiest time of human history for sure. Less violent, the least violent.

Speaker 4:          02:32:53       I think it's like pretty gravy. We have such a, like a, you know, maturing sense of morality.

Speaker 1:          02:32:58       That's awesome because we're aware that we don't need to be in Iraq blowing things up. So the fact that this is happening and it's so unjustified and it's so ridiculous and there's so much information that shows like very clearly that it's all been done under the auspices of lies and bullshit that, you know, it's, it's, it's offensive to people that that exists in this day and age. So that's why people run up and say, well, there's so much war and it's so much violence and it's so ridiculous and we're so doomed. They're right. But in perspective to the history of the human race there, they're not really, right. It's a pretty cushy time. As long as you're not in the more zone.

Speaker 4:          02:33:35       Yeah, because, well I think that's the thing about violence is is so you know it's so focalized now and little spots, but you look at these areas we're talking about. I think that violence used to be just omnipresent. Yeah. Like you know like here in town, like out of the La Brea tar pits, like one human body came out of the La Brea tar pits. It was like a woman from 9,000 years ago who had been struck in the head with some kind of Tomahawk object. The guy can work man who comes out of the Columbia River from sometime around. Then he's got an Arrow head buried in them. That guy they pull out of the Italian Alps from 7,000 years ago. He's got two Arrow heads buried in them. Yeah. It's like you can't, Yup. If you find like an, you can't find the old skeleton that old and pulled up without having to be that this guy had been mixing it up with other people in a highly violent, yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:34:22       It's funny because the older pro, the primates go, the more they have marks on him from big cats and as they get more and more modern, they're, they're fucked up by humans. Yeah. The ice man. Right. He'd, he'd been, he'd been fucked up a couple of times. Right. The cat though, man, he made some sweet stuff to his shoes are made out of a variety of different leathers and insulate boss. He was bad. Amazing. Fine. If I could hang out with any guy, like if people said, if you could hang out with anyone alive or dead, it would be the ice man. That guy, I would love old. Was He when? When the weight is seven seven thousand seven thousand years ago. Wow. He was tattooed 7,000 years ago. People lived like that. It's a little bit of goddamn blink of an eye. Right. His name is [inaudible] Uzi.

Speaker 4:          02:35:05       Yeah. That's what they type it in. You don't know what his real fucking mammos no, they gave him a handle. I guy was a bad ass though. That's a real hunter right there. Yeah. Or he didn't Hunt Highway Z. Otz. Yeah, he didn't have high highwire they'll highway or offensive for that dude. He's fair. Chase. How do you feel about, I know there's a big issue. I believe it's an Idaho on the introduction of a Canadian wolves, those big ass fucking giant gray wolves. And they're like, currently it's a reintroduction, but there are different types of Wolf. It's a different species than the native wolf. There are native timber, timber will like gray wolf, timber wolves. It's the same wall. So why are they so small and Idaho and they're so big, the ones that come from Canada because they, you know, one thing you wind up with is, well, you know, you had the red wolf down small in New Mexico.

Speaker 4:          02:35:50       Yeah, but I mean generally mammals tend to be much bigger at the northern end of their range. So you look at a mature deer in Alberta, he's going to be, you ain't might be 250 pounds. You take the same species, deer in Florida and he's going to be a hundred pounds. And she's like, mammals are always bigger at the northern end of the extreme because what you wind up having is you have less surface area and it's easier for them to retain more. If you have more surface area, it's easier to get rid of warmth, so the fact that you're pulling like the, you might go get some big ass wolves out of northern Canada and bring them in. I don't think that's the issue of them being different sides. It's all the same species. It's a gray wolf. Oh, I support both the reintroduction of wolves and I support the eventual control through hunting of those wolves.

Speaker 4:          02:36:37       They're already hunting them. There's a picture of this check with this giant fucking Wolf that she shot. They're a huge man. Yeah. Then another big critters take names. That's like a very like that right there is one of the, you know in like and hunting and conservation issues and ethics issues. The debate about what to do about these wolves, but this one woman in this photo, this one right here, and see this fit. Their official stories at the wolf was running up to attack this woman and she had a of Bose down, shot it with a handgun. Here's the thing, I'm not looking at your computer, but you have to, I trust you. You're a little more cautious than to just start typing stuff in and balls show. She could be full of Shit and she could've been out there poaching.

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       And

Speaker 4:          02:37:17       besides, there is a wolf season going on right now. There, there is some, there was wolf hunting going on this fall and winter in, in a number of western states. And,

Speaker 3:          02:37:28       oh, wait a minute. Here's a store. This is really interesting. Is this from the outfitter? Listen, let me tell you this. He took a group of nine out of state elk archery hunters from the Great Lakes region. They ended up calling a pack of 17 wolves by elk cow calling. Oh, there you go. Big Ass fucking group of wolves. And none of the hunters had a side arm or a wolf tag and it was a very traumatic experience that will surrounded them. It says all of the hunters, uh, went home early, very disturbed, claiming these wolves were very different from the Great Lakes wolves. These Idaho Wolves actually hunt you and they're not afraid of you.

Speaker 4:          02:38:02       None of that. No one's been, they had a documented, the first documented wolf kill in decades in Alaska and one woman. They've never, anyone who's afraid of wolves is just a pussy. Who's afraid of stuff? Wait a minute of wolf killed a woman. You have one person. Like what? How often

Speaker 3:          02:38:21       we'll come in contact with wool. Well you know when we got killed by coyotes in Canada a couple of years ago,

Speaker 4:          02:38:26       well it looks like people like people get killed by some of the, probably got killed by domestic dogs. But I mean like if you're afraid of wolves, it's like I would suggest like those guys and it's too bad they're from the Great Lakes State. Cause that's my home area. I would tell those guys the day are some of the law, the, I'm glad they're not in the woods anymore. If you would actually leave because of some wolves. Well there's so big man. Look at the size of this photo. It's big. You've seen that, that wolf. Oh, you know what? You know what that, that won't, let me see that picture. I think you're looking at it online at hoax. That photo. That's a that that wolf was killed in Europe. It was, yeah. That's not, you're looking at it online.

Speaker 3:          02:39:02       It says a Canadian gray, 180 pound male Canadian. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:39:05       Great nod that pictures made the round recently shot near Central Idaho. It's horse shit that this is from the Idaho Observer, man. Let me see this. June, 2009 the either the Observer. Yeah. Is it a dude holding her while dude? Yeah. Maybe the Idaho Observer got hoaxed Tony, that wolf is not what you picture has been making the rounds

Speaker 3:          02:39:27       from 35 transplanted specimens as of 1996 the federally reintroduced Canadian Gray Wolves have multiplied and spread throughout the northern two thirds of Idaho and are decimating wild game hurts. This nonessential program is a complete failure according to some, but a master stroke in a dial diabolical federal occupational planning. And what they're saying is that there's more than 4,000 of these and that they were going to let them get to a point of a 1500 and then they were going to start calling them. But now it's gotten like pretty adult

Speaker 4:          02:39:58       Mohamed. Here's the promise. Nothing you're saying like nothing you're saying is really debatable. Those statistics and facts minus the commentary are true. But what you're running up against is you're looking at a piece of propaganda put out by a guy who's like categorically anti wolf. I would gather that photo you're looking at has made the rounds and has been attributed to being killed in a number of states by number of people. There was this one is the size of that fucking thing. This got killed.

Speaker 1:          02:40:29       That's another one. Like, so there's some big wolves getting killed, but there's big wolves that were way bigger than the ones that were living there when they introduced these new wolves. These new world's got a lot bigger.

Speaker 4:          02:40:40       Uh, I don't, I don't think the hunt, not packs of 20.

Speaker 1:          02:40:47       It's not a first name. Okay, well listen, I, I'm out. That's why I'm asking you. They're fucking beautiful man. I'll tell you that. There's a photo of some dark one. Look at that. There's such wild looking animals, man. Oh, the grayed out. Incredible. Yeah. I, I had a, a friend of mine and uh, he went and, uh, went wolf hunting and I was like, wow, what the fuck man, why would you hunt wolves?

Speaker 4:          02:41:08       Well, I think that we have an obligation to try to manage a population if we have an obligation to do like targeted reintroductions and things that we've extra pay it through human use, but I don't then think that that means that it becomes perpetually off limits and we can't do any management. I mean, we manage it by bringing it there and I think that we need to maintain the control on it because I don't think, I think that we have other obligations to other interested parties. And to say that you're going to bring,

Speaker 1:          02:41:35       besides that one, there's another one is huge. So I have the one shot and Idaho. He's a fucking giant welds man. These are huge, and I'm with you though, but I think that's the important thing is that people need to understand that they need to be managed and that they were brought in. They were managed in the first place. The whole, they didn't exist there before.

Speaker 4:          02:41:52       No, they did. But they were mismanaged. I mean they, they existed there.

Speaker 1:          02:41:55       I would say that right in the Dick. If I see it my backyard, I'll tell you right now, manage mismanaged. Fuck you. Go Fuck Yourself. That giant ass teeth snarling. Motherfucker was in my backyard looking to eat me.

Speaker 4:          02:42:07       They were there. We had wolves and we wiped them out through poisoning and various uncontrolled things like we did. We didn't have a system in place to preserve the resource or some people might object to the term resource, but we didn't have a system in place to make a sustainable population. Later. We tried to right that wrong by doing reintroductions and some people have a hard time accepting the fact that we could make it jump from having been that we screwed up and wipe them out. Now we put them back and accepting the fact that we would now make a jump to, to, to start killing them.

Speaker 1:          02:42:45       Right. But, but as, as some by the argument at all, it's not the same breed if it is a much larger margin wolf and a lot of people think, and that's the stupidities, that this is a bigger animal. This is an animal that's not native to this area. The genetics are different than the animal.

Speaker 4:          02:42:59       I don't think you, you know, to get into what is a breed and a species, it's the same I'm telling you. Right. But there's the same species. You might have their bigger, right. I don't think there's any way. There's no way to argue that because you don't have enough specimens of old ones to tell if they were bigger. Now

Speaker 1:          02:43:16       forget what I said about not hunting one. I want that rug. Yeah, it's nice. It's beautiful. I need that. Come on, man. So big, crazy giant fucking as long as you've found out that wolf was a cunt. I was like, this is one wolf. He was fucking with all the other wolves. Nobody likes cows, an asshole. He's raping all the female wolves. Nobody's going to miss that shithead. He ate everybody sheep. So

Speaker 4:          02:43:38       if you have blue some houses down, you might get some, really, you might get some really big wolves by, maybe you're taking some walls and putting it in and do it like a place where they have very little competition with one another and they have a great food resource and they're living to be, uh, an older age because there's not predation on the wolves. So maybe you're getting some big wolfs, but you can't get hung up on this idea that somehow they screwed up and brought a bigger wolf into an area where it didn't belong. It's like the gray wolf.

Speaker 1:          02:44:15       Uh Huh. Now you put those animals in Idaho, we're getting to be about 70, 80 pounds and these walls that they've introduced from Canada, I get to be 200 pounds. That's a different animal. I, I mean, I'm just reading what they're saying. They're saying that this is the major issue is that this is a larger animal is that's not true. I'm not, you're saying it's not animal, no matter what he does, it's the same species. Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:44:39       I'm not equipped to talk about how big the average weight is. I have, I don't know how anyone would really have the data to show me what the average weight was before wolves were extirpated in that area and what the average way it is now, and I don't try, and as much as I, I've enjoyed talking to you, I don't trust the, the, the random pages that you're pulling up or really pull my information off that. Yeah, I understand. It's, I think that you're getting into something that's a bit more complicated and something that's not really easy to pin down. Why I don't have an opinion. There's a lot of ways there's not, there's a lot of ways in which you would find the animals under. Some sets of circumstances tend to get really big. The same way. If you take two pigs out of the same litter, these hogs, Zillow's right, two brothers out of the same litter, put one out in the wild and the arid area and put one in a corn bin and then tell me that the one most have been a different species cause he got really big.

Speaker 1:          02:45:36       Right. I see what you're saying. So I don't really know. I'm not familiar with, even though humans are humans and um, you, you went to Africa and you've got the biggest people and you made them slaves and then you brought him over here and then you made the mate and have big, giant babies. Even though that that person could breed with anyone here and they are in fact human and of the same species. There's no doubt genetically they're different. They're bigger. Sure.

Speaker 4:          02:46:04       There's no, I mean there's no doubt that any populations that have been separated for a significant amount of time becoming some way

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       genetically different. Tricky to bring in. I mean look at this again. I don't know nearly enough. The only reason why I'm bringing this up is the argument of all these anti looks. This is the doom and gloom. I'm scared that wolves are kind of come get me approach. You know, it's like these people that are upset saying he's just some big, I managed and they're fucking up there and they would have preferred it. These are big ass and they would prefer, they brought some smaller wolves. They would prefer that they would be wolves that are the same size as the indigenous was the old kind of the walls that are still there. They still exist tonight. Oh, they're still native walls. They just, these Canadian wolves. They're saying again, this is what they're saying. I just think, what do you, what is your dirty hands on management? There've been wolves that big is that we're saying that native ones.

Speaker 4:          02:46:52       Uh, okay. There's two. You have some natural reintroduction of wolves going on in the northern rock. What is the benefit of that? You, well, let me, let me explain. I'm saying there was definitely a period of time when you were not gonna find in the greater Yellowstone area, for instance, wolves were pretty much gone. However, there's always been some number of wolves that would drift in from Canada and come in and maybe not have like really established populations, but they would come in and they would drift out and they would come in and drift out. At the point of time we're in right now, we have a lot of animals there. There are a lot of like thriving wolf packs in the northern Rockies that derived from animals. We specifically brought in and reintroduced and there's a lot of animals that are probably derived from animals that naturally drifted in from Canada.

Speaker 4:          02:47:50       If they're saying that somehow the ones that were reintroduced tend to be larger than the ones that were, are naturally spreading out and distributing into these areas from Canada. I don't really know if that's really the question we're talking about right now. I don't know how to answer that. I, I'd have to look more carefully at what you're looking at and I'd have to ask someone who's familiar with it in an unbiased sense. If wolves in fact came from this land of real big bigness. I know that you will get for a number of factors. You will find that bears, for instance, bears and Pennsylvania, black bears and Pennsylvania. Same species is black bears in Montana, but the ones in Pennsylvania you get way bigger than they do in Montana. Also. The ones in Pennsylvania are almost invariably black. The ones in Montana have are tend to be chocolate, Brown and blond.

Speaker 4:          02:48:45       They find that if you're in a area that has over 20 inches of rainfall, you tend to have more jet black bears. If they have an area with a lot of mast like acorns and beach nuts, they tend to get much bigger than the area where they don't. Bears that have access to salmon tend to get much bigger than areas that don't. A lot of those things are of words they're living, so if a bear is living in Pennsylvania getting huge on acorns and you bring that bear and put them in the air environment, he's going to change. It's like you don't, you don't know that he's going to be continued to be like to put off giant bears. He might be taking like bears that are genetically equal and you're putting them in prime habitat and giving them all the available resources they need to achieve their maximum size.

Speaker 4:          02:49:35       It would make sense to me if you had an area that had no population of wolves and you had a population of deer and elk who are not accustomed to predation by wolves, and you took some wolves from an area where they tended to reach maximum size of 120 pounds and you introduce them into this area and they live without competition from other packs and they have access to massive supplies of meat that has no idea what they are. And then you come and tell me that 20 years later you find that these walls that used to be around an average of 120 pounds are now averaging 150 pounds. I wouldn't be remotely surprised by that. Okay. That totally makes sense to me. And you know, of course you always have to throw everything through the fearmongering filter and everybody's worried that the wolves are coming.

Speaker 4:          02:50:20       I disagree that you're a pussy if you get killed by a wolf because one person, no, you're not a pushing to get killed by frank. Your Pussy. If you're afraid. I think of your post. If you don't go in the woods because of wolf. Did you see the Liam Neeson trailer for the movie? The gray surrounded by wolves, bro. I was supposed to review that. I was supposed to review that moved from outside but I could go really to the, I could never, they could never line up the screening Fao. Dammit. Why would I was supposed to review it through the Lens of how well does this really accurately portray wilderness last word on the subject. What is the benefit of bringing these wolves back? Cause it to thin out the herds of the benefit to bring those bulls back would be to, to write some of the wrongs we've committed against the environment and to try to help create a intact ecosystem with all of the players present on the land and make things extra scary in the woods.

Speaker 4:          02:51:12       Yeah. If that, if you want to go camping, he hit you hear that shit outside your door, sniffing your fucking tent. It separates the men from the boys. You know? I actually like, I like hunting and grizzly areas because one I like. I like that sense of thrill. And Pat, you said grizzly areas meaning the bare areas that have been around them to camp near them? Yeah. Oh Jeez. I liked the feeling of being near him and I also liked that a lot of people don't like it and you can, you tend, I think that it has a detectable effect on competition. If I had an iron man suit, I'll go hunting, bear with the iron man suit and just beat the fuck out of a bear. Do you think that's how it, that would be the ultimate way to fight a bear? It was a guy at an iron man. Have you seen the grizzly project? Oh yeah, that's right. He does have some kind of a crazy tries to make a work. He can't get the berries

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       to attack them. Yeah. Oh, that's hilarious. They even go out in the woods and like shoot a horse and waiting for the bears to hit it, and he tried to go up and confront the bears, but you could never get a bear to come at him. I lived in Colorado for a while and one of the things in my town was a bear had started breaking into cars and they were telling people, don't leave food in your car or the bear will go in there and you would think, well, the bear is just going to look. There's no food. He's going to leave. No, they eat the inside of your fucking car. They eat everything. They state your fucking dashboard. Well also, if you have leather seats, I bet it probably confuses the shit out of them.

Speaker 2:          02:52:37       You hear of a eating vinyl gas cans. Oh God, I gotta I gotta place in Southeast Alaska and the neighbor is telling me about a bear that broke into a guy shed there and ate a three gowns of gear oil. Well, the lack of fuck, can you imagine laptop? Fuck. Can you imagine? What do you think came out of his room that came out of your asshole? Shit going 75 miles an hour with high viscosity. They'll fucking mobile one commercial. Hey, by the way, it will we wait, we only have a few minutes left. Did you hear about seadog or moderator that, uh, that what happened to him over no. Thursday? No. What happened? Well, I guess unfortunately he's been battling a lot of depression lately and he's a, he did suicide by cop in Glendale and uh, I guess, uh, his, his girlfriend or some females said that, uh, you know, he's been trying to kill himself. He's been, you know, over to try and overdose and drugs and stuff. Then the other day something happened,

Speaker 1:          02:53:32       so he was like that guy that stood in the middle of the street in Hollywood, shooting at cars, kind of redness. A friend of you guys. Yeah. We hung out with this guy. Yeah. We hung out with this guy at the, um, at the Canyon Club.

Speaker 2:          02:53:44       Yeah. And he just got shot by cops. Yeah. He lunged towards a cop with a knife. And I guess before right before that he tried to overdose on drugs and you tried to come in and stuff where the cop Kellum yeah, yeah. She was dead. Yeah, he's dead.

Speaker 1:          02:53:58       Whoa. Yeah. What do you mean moderator? He's a moderate or a message board. Like he's, he, uh, we have a message board. It's very, it's a huge mess of boards going like more than 5 million posts on it. And this guy was one of the monitoring. It's kind of like one of the guys that lives here more than once. We hang out with him more than once. Yeah. Yeah. He was actually gonna I was gonna try and get him to train my dog. Yeah, he was, he wanting to train my dogs too. When I, when I have those pit bulls, he was always trying to tell me he's going to come over and fix him. What'd you have pit bulls for? Um, I love them. I grow up with them. They're just really smart dogs. You know, I'd really became too much of a pain in the ass.

Speaker 1:          02:54:31       I got older. I don't like the dog aggressiveness. Know I have a massive, now is just the opposite. He doesn't, he never wants to, he doesn't hate dog at all. And it mix it up. If he gets close to dogs, he's like, Hey, what's up? You know, he's like, he's the big silly, but it was just, I loved them with people. They were the most affectionate, intelligent dogs of people. It really make a great connection with them. And I grew up with them. But the real issue is when you have them around other dogs, they're just too crazy too, is the, the all the years and years and years of conditioning, you can't get it out of their system. They've had generation after generation of calling the dogs that would not fight or would quit. You know? So what, what it comes out to is survival of the fittest while they're so smart and quick and they're so loyal and they also kill all the dogs that show any human aggression because he's, you know, when they may breed these dogs to find, they would have to be able to get in and separate them.

Speaker 1:          02:55:20       So if the dog, you know, turns on you and bite you, they would get rid of all those dogs. So there were like nonhuman aggressive, really intelligent survival dogs and they're there. There's really fucking brilliant animals, but they're too crazy. I think you need to shit to greed of the wall sits who's a really cute, they're all, they all come from walls, which is really fucking crazy and no one really understands. I know by the way, people have sent me a bunch of things here. They explain it how dogs came from all I've read it. It's a lot of fucking guesswork and patchwork. You can't take, you show me one fucking guy ever who's taken a wolf and turn it into a Chihuahua. We show me showing that they can do, they have done some pretty amazing, not that, but when in in trying to explain how that could have happened.

Speaker 1:          02:56:03       They've done some pretty amazing selective breeding with Fox. Yes, they have. I have change it like dogs 10,000 years ago, they did this shit a long time, over a period of time that we have a really almost difficult time comprehending. Yeah, I know, but it's still, I mean it's amazing that it's been done. I mean, I'm not doubting they did call come from wolves. Absolutely did. I mean, I mean I believe at 100% geneticists have proven all variations on we'll know for sure. But it is hard. You know it's hard. Flash lived. You'd wind up with like a, like a mini poodles are. When I say I'm incredulous, it's not that I'm not, maybe it's just like that can't even wrap my head around the [inaudible] Wolf and 12 hug. They turn a wolf into a fucking French poodle. Like what? What, why? Yeah, what the fuck happened?

Speaker 1:          02:56:49       If I could wave a magic wand and have them all go back to wolves, I work. Cause it's like it'd be more enjoyable to have him around. I don't know man. It's kind of cool when people have a little Chihuahua and they keep it in their bag and you're like, hey little buddy. It's nothing wrong with that. But it is really a sign of what we are, you know, we are just like, I mean if you wanted to look at people, people are the only thing that would like dogs. You know, we vary so much in size and shape and looks, and yet we can breed with each other. You know, it's really quite strange, dude. You are a great spokesman for the idea of hunting and for an intelligent well read person who appreciates it for, for what it really is. You know? And I think your, your stance on is admirable and your stance against it, you know, the high fence and the, the, you know, just the ethics that you have towards it.

Speaker 1:          02:57:32       It's a lot of people can learn from it. I think in a lot of people can learn. And it's one of the things that I took from your show that a, it's not just a, you know, being a sportsman, if there's, there's discipline to it and that you benefit from that discipline. And what you were talking about when you're talking about how when you're in the state of hunting that you're not thinking about anything. You're just totally in the group. That zen state is what everyone is looking for in martial arts and in that playing pool and it's doing standup comedy, that Zen state of being completely in the moment, you know, and that's chasing that down. Um, and uh, I've always been a big supporter of trying to, you know, be self sustainable practice what I preach and a fucking buy bottled water. I would really, I'd like to pull it off Sunday. I like to pull it off and I think what you're doing is brilliant. So uh, people want to see your show. They can catch it on the, what does the network outdoors on sportsman channel. What I would have been fine as is
