Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay, it's on. I can't hear you.

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       I can't hear me. Hear me, hear me now, but it's not very loud. We're using the wrong mic too. I am sorry I won't use it. How's that one? It's not any better. In fact it's lower. Hello? It's actually your headphones. How am I? How's mine? Hello? Hello? It sounds great.

Speaker 1:          00:00:34       Yeah. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello.

Speaker 2:          00:00:39       So should I add snowflakes right now? Hello? Hello? Hello?

Speaker 1:          00:00:43       Hello? Hello? Hello?

Speaker 2:          00:00:46       There it is. Yeah, these headphones suck, but if you turn it all the way up, it's okay doc. And can you talk? Hello? Hello? Beautiful. We're good. How do I drop the volume online? You start sucking his cock. How do you suck? It's pushed forward towards me.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       Hello? Hello? Hello? I thought that's better. I guess still as wowed. Don't be gay.

Speaker 2:          00:01:08       You know you're on right now. Like 10 minutes ago you were just telling me when and I'm like, all right, ready dude, you got to do a better job. Not just preposterous. Were all smoking. We will know what the fuck is going on. How dare you. So when I say gay, I spelled a g h e y no take backs. Broken experience is brought. We're about to have news, new sponsors. You've got some really cool lined up, very excited in the video game world. Very excited. Yeah. I can't tell you preview, but uh, another very cool sponsor and I'm super excited about it looks. It's a, you know, one of the cool things about having this podcast is you can kind of pick and choose who sponsors the show. You know, we've had some offers from stuff that we really weren't Kinda into. And so like how do we even do this?

Speaker 2:          00:01:55       This wouldn't even work. It's not something we give a shit about. But I'd like video games more than I want to like video games unfortunately. Yeah. We both have problems in my life. So we're going to come. We're going to help contribute to a lot of people's addiction soon. Really cool. A lot of it is ipad. I can't tell you shit. A lot of them are ipad based though. It's really cool. The IPAD. The cool thing about the IPAD is it's a gyroscope or whatever the fuck you call it detects motion euros, scope, like it's like a sandwich and you, um, you can drive cars and do all kinds of things just by moving the pattern. That's fucking incredible device. Really seen those remote control planes that you can fly with this. Yes, I have quadra copters. Our original sponsor though is the flashlight, the first one, the, the one back when we were snowflakes in the back of a ustream page on, uh, on the laptop back in the day as a, 200 episodes ago by the way, focusing. That's like 600 hours of listening to you. I don't have that much to say. People say you repeat shit. I'm like, dude, what the fuck do you think, man? Come

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       on dude. It sounds like we're talking about the news. And I were talking about some pretty preposterous share that I think about all the time and I repeat things to myself all the time. I have a certain amount of memory and it's all taken up by the fleshlight ladies. Gentlemen, if you go to Joe Rogan.net and click on a link for the flashlight, entering the code name, Rogan, you will get 15 percent off a very solid product. A product that if I left you alone on an island for a million years, is all the tools in the world. You would never be able to figure it out. You'd never be able to figure out how to make a flashlight. Okay? You wouldn't. It'd be like at a salmon over the average person. You would never even never figured it. Yeah. And then you get those little bones in your insured to wrap some bamboo like leaves around a salmon.

Speaker 3:          00:03:38       You know what? You would never figured out. Also, vitamins, you would never figure out Alpha brain. You would never figure out new mood. He would never figure it out. True Tech Sport or shroom, tech, immune. All of these are what we call nootropics except for a shroom tech that's a little bit of a nootropic, but also more of a something that, uh, is, uh, aids, your immune system and your, um, your athletic performance. There's all the explanations for all these various products. It's available on [inaudible] dot com. That's o n n I t checkout Alpha brain. That is the cognitive enhancing supplement. New Mood is the five htp and l trip defend supplement. Um, both of those things are great for boosting your, your own body's production of Serotonin, which actually puts you in a better mood. Believe it or not, a lot of the way you feel is fucking chemical.

Speaker 3:          00:04:25       And of course a lot of it is that people are depressed because their livestocks let's be. A lot of us are wage slaves. Let's be honest. That's not good. And I don't think taking pills while that's going on, just to try to trick yourself into thinking that everything's groovy. I'm not a really big believer in that either. I'm much more of a proponent of, you know, get your fucking life in order and you'd be amazed at how much better you feel. But then again, I've never had a problem with the balance of my mind and I know people have. So I don't, I don't ever say that you shouldn't take this or you should take that. Everybody's fucking completely different and it's preposterous to think that you know, the inner workings of another man's mind that said, go to [inaudible] dot com. Check out all the shit we have for sale.

I eat like a fucking savage sometimes, you know, but I earned that for the most part. I drink Kale shakes every morning with fresh garlic and ginger and salary. Like the more you take good things into your body, the more you can justify those krispy Kreme donuts. I'm like, fuck it, I'm just going off right now. And you always feel like shit afterwards. But I think rewards like that, even your body can process that. If you do it on occasion. You know, if you do it once a week, once a week day where you just eat ice cream, like a fucking slob. So nothing wrong with that. As long as the rest of the week, generally speaking, treat your body like you fucking love it and it's precious because it is bitches on a.com.

Speaker 3:          00:06:56       Dunkin. There's some Russell and trying to find my alpha. If you're on a desert island, you would make Alpha brain adult mermaid mermaid dried scrapings from the inside of them were always pushing marriage, but they say the method, the mermaid came from horny sailor is trying to rationalize fucking seals. Course fucking everything. Manatees. Manatees, yeah. They'd fuck a manatee because there are so horny and they then they'd be like, no, it was a mermaid. I swear. It's kind of a crazy asshole. Would commit back then getting into the goddamn boat and going across the ocean for like four months. A lot of times, not even knowing if there was some shit on the other end thinking it might just stop like they thought the world just ended and there a waterfall. That's how bad Europe sucked in the 14 hundreds that Columbus was like, yeah, maybe it does fall off.

Speaker 3:          00:07:44       Let's go. Pitches come on forever. Look what the fuck we're eating at the streets. We're living in. People stink. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the. They were so upset with Europe. They were like, fuck this. We're just going to get in a boat and go to someplace. I mean, we're not even looking at it really, truly and perspective because here's something that was really, really rare back then. Any one on one accounts of someone who went there that liked it. Forget about picture. They didn't have pictures back then. Would you see some drawings? No, you didn't even talk to one guy probably that went over there himself and had a wonderful and prosperous life and was telling me, listen, there's land to be had. It's a great time. Come on. Over. What a great mass of movement of humans in such a short period of time.

Speaker 3:          00:08:35       The population or the population of the North American continent, you know, the fact that there was already a small group of nomadic people that were living here and they were just completely overwhelmed by the volume and the numbers. I think there are a lot of them in, in North America. I think there was a lot of native Americans and indigenous people. When you say a lot, was there like millions? Like. No, no. Let me say, let me say even if there was a lot, it's nothing in comparison to what it is. Like right now like this, there's never been population numbers like this anywhere, right? Where the, uh, what is that? Has there ever been a place where there was virtually no one and an immigrants all came in and then within a few hundred years there's $300 million over? Nope. No. Right. I mean we, unless it was pre flood before the last media or impact or something like that, I wonder how many native Americans or were before they were killed and pushback back.

Speaker 3:          00:09:29       And you know what, that must have been unbelievable for them. The people that have lived their lives like a certain way before the first white men came. You know, it must have been mostly been preposterous. Like you know, they probably generation after generation, they had followed the buffalo and they had lived this, you know, very disciplined in spiritual and sort of in tune with nature and their environment and they had very clear laws of morality and how you deal with nature and how you use up your resources. Really fascinating. Like you could tell that they had a deep reverence and a real understanding for the resources of the environment and not taking too much, not wasting anything because you might not have it man. Like they, they were under a real concern about starving to death if they didn't get up in the morning and follow the buffalo and they lost those motherfuckers.

Speaker 3:          00:10:18       If they have no food for a few weeks, like what people use, your baby can die. Man. You might just fuck up and run into a, you know, time to seasons wrong and run into someplace where you're stuck chasing these buffalo in a place that gets snowed in and there's no food. Oh yeah. Not to mention the fact that bears are eating you a bear. That's a real worry for you. Yeah. Especially if you're in the woods and you fuck up and stumble upon its mother. A mother and the cubs are getting there. They're fucking monsters. I mean, think about how aggressive people are around their babies. You know, you're dealing with a giant thousand pound fucking dog essentially. So they go, I mean dogs a dog with thick skin. Those things as such. They did a scan. They bite themselves. They don't even hurt themselves. Never seen them go to war with each other.

Speaker 3:          00:11:07       Yeah, they're taking chunks of hairs are flying and shit like that and they're fine. They're fine. Just get the fuck out of each other. Being each other's Claude, each other's crap. They literally would have dismembered, are weak and gelatinous like bodies was just torn them apart like they're nothing just crunched through your skull. What a shit life it must have been back then. I mean the American Indians on one hand you can say there was a lot of satisfaction in that life and they probably were happier than the majority of people today. I think that's really arguable, but that's just the majority of people there for weak ass bitches. It's not that today isn't way more awesome and people get confused in that. Sometimes people go, you know what? People were happier back when they couldn't read. Did you know that people are happier? People

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       have your back when they just had grunts and everybody knew what they had to do to keep saying that doesn't mean back then doesn't suck, and today's an awesome. It just means that today is so uber complex that a lot of people just don't even try. They just go and do it and they just throw it down on the ground and they run away because there's no mechanism to really take care of that back then. If you throw yourself on the ground, I'm not doing this so fucking barrack eats you a bobcat would you? You have to kill you. You'd starve to death. Now you can really get a lot of like weird, like weepy. You can be really weepy and scared with very little effect, but the effect is, like you say, you still get an effect. I mean, the effect is for sure you never progressed, but you don't have to worry about getting eaten outside your house.

Speaker 2:          00:12:39       You're not going to get eaten. Yeah. This, the, the, the reason why people develop character, the reason why people develop consequences because there are consequences for not having those things. There's consequences for not having character. This confident. There's consequences for not having confidence, for not having control over your environment, for not being a fucking man. There are consequences, but what are they really? They're pretty meager. Some other guy fucks your girlfriend. She leaves you for someone who's more powerful. You lose your, your metal box and you have to get an older metal box that someone has already lived in. You know what? What is it? They take your car away. You get a new car, you have to move to a shitty apartment. What? What, what? What does it really happened? Cumulative effect of everything that you're saying means that you're living in hell when you're a bitch is what?

Speaker 2:          00:13:23       It's pointing out the garbage. But my point is, even with the shittier new car, you know, the, the less cool car, the older car in this shitty apartment, you're still living a billion times lever better than anybody did when they were, you know, Lewis and Clark would hitchhike in their way across the fucking country, walking no horses and shit. They didn't know what the fuck was going on. That was a ridiculous thing to do. You're living pretty, pretty much everyone is living a life that's very similar to like Roman mobility. You've got running water. You can just go and turn the water on, take a hot shower, heats it up. That's a brand new thing. You've got a microwave, you can cook your food and two minutes. Have you seen those new? Or there's new water heaters where it's a constant flow of hot water.

Speaker 2:          00:14:08       It heats it instantly and you don't have to have like giant tanks of water. The water goes through it and instantly heats it up. So you could take a shower for an hour and a half and it, you'll never run out of hot water. Yeah. So you, you're living in paradise here. You're not living back in the day when you wanted to kill fleas on your clothes, you would put it over the toilet. Did you know about that? And the castles and the castles. If you got the. So everything was flea infested back then. Everything was fleeing fast that there's fleas fucking everywhere because no, no way to clean, no way to know poison for this Lisa. Everything swarming with fleas until your clothes will get filled with fleas and to get rid of the fleas and a castle, they would put the clothes over the shaft

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       where the sewer sewer is because the ammonia would rise up through the clothes and kill the fleas and the clothes. Oh my God. That's the world you're living in. You're washing your clothes and shit fumes. So they had to take those clothes and they had to all walk around smelling fumes, but that's better than the fleas, man. That's better than the fleas. I'd rather smell like old first one to figure that out. It's like it's gotTa. Be a way to get these fucking.

Speaker 3:          00:15:19       Let's try light myself on fire. No, that doesn't work. That just kills me. Let's try running through the frozen river. Nope. No Hypothermia. Shit. Fuck. What about shit? Shit. Nobody likes shit. I run away from Shit. Let's see who's. Let's play chicken with Shit. Smell. See who quits first. Who for

Speaker 4:          00:15:36       human being? You could get burned at the stake if you took a shower more than twice a year. Like if you were taking like three or four showers a year, people might get suspicious. Like you should take a lot of shower.

Speaker 3:          00:15:46       Will they also be like, why is so clean? Why do you smell that? Which only witches smell good. Yeah. When you like take a warm shower and then you climb into some like really soft cotton clothes and you were like, you are feeling better than most humans have ever felt in my whole life. That's like a deeper sense of pleasure. You plop down on your soft and comfortable bed and for, you know, look for a real reason. You're not scared of getting eaten by anything. Nope. You're not scared of monsters or tribes coming into town and rating your village and. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. You're just chilling. Maybe sometimes you get colds and then you know you get a z pack. Hate your fucking fine. You know, you sitting in front of a television with the avatar playing say, and you're, you're sitting propped up on your pillows and your wearing clean clothes.

Speaker 3:          00:16:38       You have it better than anyone who's ever lived ever by a long shot. Did you imagine Lewis and Clark, if you could show those motherfuckers the average 23 year old dude lives in some shitty apartment is propped up on his bed watching TV in his bedroom, eyes, roommates, fucking loud and the other room with a blender like that guy's living in paradise. He's like displays, place. Show us onto the mouths. You saw one mouse. That's it. Well, there's not everywhere. Infesting all your clothes and eating your food and giving everyone horrible diseases. That's killing everyone. Old. Everyone with a weak immune system is just fucking dead. There's nowhere to put the body. So they stack them in the streets than the rats get infested with it and then the rat starts spreading it all over town. And then you have the black plague. Yeah. Oh, you saw a mouse

Speaker 4:          00:17:24       who poor little booby won't be okay with sharing the world with a mouse. Don't. And also don't forget the fact that like if you were pregnant, there's a pretty good chance you're going to die. Most likely you're going to die when that thing comes out of your pussy, like you're just going to split you in half and there's no antibiotics in. The baby's probably going to die too.

Speaker 3:          00:17:42       During Rome, the infant mortality rate was 50 percent. Fifty percent, half the babies died and you know, that's one of the things we. You read about like crazy stories of the Bible. We've talked about this before about how so everything was so violent, so crazy, and people say, well, this is really a book of God, the Book of religion. Why would it have such gratuitous violence? Why would violence be condoned? Oh, you don't even. I don't even think we could wrap our hands around how hard life was back when they wrote the Bible. I mean, and the, even the New Testament, even with Constantine and the bishops, when they reworked the New Testament, that's still, you know, that's still ridiculously hard. It's a terrible life back then, you know, and, and you, I think they probably needed religion back then. We think about how, how easy life is today and there's so many people that need a safety net. So many people that are terrified so many people that want one sanity to this and they, they seek that Saturday and no really ridiculous mythology, but back then it was imperative. You had to have it.

Speaker 4:          00:18:50       I think Patton Oswald's got some brilliant joke about this where he talks about how religion was invented to trick dumb people that there's a cake in. This guy says he stopped, like attacking everyone. Essentially. It's just really smart. People recognize that there's really dumb people that have no qualms in killing and doing ridiculous things is that they tell them this fib to make them behave.

Speaker 3:          00:19:14       I can't remember the jokes. Awesome. Look it up. Sorry. It could be possible, but I've always thought that what I mean, I always joke around about it being for dumb people, but I think there's a pull towards the idea of something other than us and I think we always have had that too. I don't think we're willing to believe that we're the end of the evolutionary food chain or the spiritual food chain. It seems silly. It seems much more likely. Like there's something above us. We just can't even communicate with it. We're just the same way and can't tell you stories where we're not able to communicate with something that's the next, the next level of existence.

Speaker 4:          00:19:47       Well, yeah, especially when we're in, especially when we're so confused by our environment and we're saddened, distracted. I mean, the thing that you were talking about initially is, is something I read this, ah, the Dalai Lama was in beverly hills talking to like some rich people and in their house doing a home visit and he said to them, you know, here we are years. You're in Beverly Hills, you have your mansion and all your things, but why are your medicine cabinets filled with antidepressants and volume and antianxiety medication? Even with all this stuff, you're still experiencing mental turbulence to the point where you're depressed. This is the. If people are still caught up in that place, it's going to be very difficult for them to to transcend it to a point where you could communicate with some higher intelligence. How are you going to do that when you're caught up in some ridiculous perception of the world where you're addicted and attached to material things where you're stuck always wanting

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       some new thing which just makes you perpetually insane. You know? Well, that's for a lot of people, that becomes their focus. You know, I think the human beings, you know, you can look at the shallowness of materialism and he could say, God, it's so shallow. God, it's so silly. Oh yes, yes and yes, but what is it really? What's going on really well? Well, human beings are constantly trying to achieve things. I mean, that's the point of staying alive. The point of staying alive is you have to achieve success out there while you're hunting success while you're fishing. There's a reason why hunting and fishing is so satisfying. I haven't been hunting. I plan on going very soon, but I'm going to go with Steve Rinella. The guy from that. Uh, that mediator show. Working it out. Yeah. Name dropper. Hey, I need a name. Drop the fucker.

Speaker 3:          00:21:30       I didn't even know that is me eating show. We're going to eat. We're going to hunt bears in Alaska. Wow. Yeah. What the fuck? Anyway. Um, uh, how did I get onto that? I'm scared. I just got scared. What'd you get? Scared of bears in Alaska. What we're talking about just before that. Oh, we're talking about materialism. Oh, then I think that it's this. Oh, that's right. Well, the reason why it's so satisfying. I did get scared. Thinking about bears. Moscow. You should. Reason why it's so satisfying. Hunting and fishing is because those tasks are. That's a prerequisite for staying alive for the longest time. For the longest time, the way we stayed alive as we had to go out and gather our food. It feels good to pick food, like if you find some blueberry somewhere and you pick them, there's like this weird joy that comes with your finding and finding a meal outside that is a natural reward system that's put in place to ensure our survival.

Speaker 3:          00:22:19       Now when there are no hunting and gathering tasks to get when it's so easy to just walk to the store and get meat, the choice is to meet and it takes literally seconds. Can I have that big perfectly aged hunk of flesh that's has no diseases on it, ready to cook right away and you know, can I have this milk that's been homogenized and pasteurized and has no chance of killing me and I can sit on the shelf for weeks and can I have this cheese that's also the same. It's very resistant to mold and all. Look at this fresh vegetables that are genetically modified and then you can grow tomatoes in the middle of the fucking winter outside. You know, it's all of it is incredible, but also easy and so accessible that there's no reward. You're not getting that reward, so people will just.

Speaker 3:          00:23:04       They're. They're being gluttonous, unlike the native Americans who the flesh was so important to them to kill with so important. Everything was so sacred that they would use every single part of the animal to honor that animal and they wanted to keep this relationship with the buffalos and what the, the deer and all the animals that they needed to sustain them. For us, that system is hijacked, hijacked by sports cars. It's hijacked by getting ahead. Uh, you know, getting a house in the hamptons. It's high, it's high jacked by having a boat. It's hijacked by all the things that you can reward yourself for women. Maybe it's jewelry or shoes where when it's shoes, a lot of women that they become obsessed with fucking handbags and shit. I was reading about this woman who was, um, some super billionaire's daughter and uh, he's, you know, I, I say is like super ridiculously wealthy.

Speaker 3:          00:23:55       She has a million dollar bathtub that's made out of crystal, like she has a bathtub that is a million dollars and they imported from Mexico. It's her bathtub, a million dollars. That's like an awesome house. A million dollars. She has just incredible supply of handbags. It's millions of dollars worth of handbags, millions of dollars worth of shoes, literally millions of dollars worth of shoes. You know, there's people that start, they get crazy and start buying high end handmade watches that are a million dollars and they look like a fucking timex. Yeah, I mean I'm exaggerating, but they don't look this, this watch watches. It's called a tw steel. It's a, it's a nice watch. It's like it's like a 150 bucks on Amazon.com or something like that. For me it's perfect. It's like cool looking. I like it. It's not flashy, it's not. I'm trying to stick out in your face, but I like the way a good machine look looks, you know, something that's designed well and that's what that looks like. But some people get crazy and they'll take it to. I'd want the finest watched constructed in the most difficult manner. Let go in a bottle. I want them to make the watch in a bottle with tweezers, you know, and I want it to be all magnetized and all of it's titanium and hand carved and get the fuck

Speaker 4:          00:25:09       made in the bottles to the no dust gets in it. Is that the reason for that? Just made the bottle part up. It's like making a ship in the bottle. Why the fuck would you make a ship in the ball? It's stupid. Who cares you? It's harder for you. Really. Fucking chip is like whatever. Like I'm not good. It's a mystery. I say make something better. That's, that's you know, right in front of you. Stupid. Why are you making things inside bottles? It's a challenge. It's like tetris back in the old days. It's outrageous. But Dude, posture is one thing. One thing that you're leaving out the difference between primitive and modern peoples living situation. You also have to take into account their mental state. People, uh, that the native Americans, they believed in like the great spirit. They didn't know too much about the universe and the way that we know it.

Speaker 4:          00:25:53       They like had this faith in a kind of ancient religion that, um, that gave them a lot of comfort. The modern guy who's buying all the ham and the meat and the fucking ship watches and bottles and the, and the crazy woman buying the person's, it gets even more absurd because their belief in the universe is either, you know, a fundamentalist Christian or religious belief that's always haunted by science. It all sides. The whole world is telling them, you know, a lot of that stuff isn't true. A lot of that stuff doesn't, uh, didn't really happen. The people, the way they're describing that, nobody flew up into the air. Now guys flew up into the air, came, came back to life after he got nailed to a cross that's never happened. Doesn't happen this. So they're fucking main. The tenants of their religion are always getting attacked on all sides by science.

Speaker 4:          00:26:39       And if you're not religious then you exist. Like if you're an atheist, then it even more weird. You're just some like super smart primate that's been stuck on a ball. You're December like tiny little tiny thinking, little primate bug thing that the force of gravity is keeping stuck to the ground on a planet spinning around like your Joe Spinning around a ball of fucking fire, so it's like if you don't really believe in God when you're in this super absurd situation, which is, it's like now I have infinite amount of food and whatever I want, but I'm just some absurd little speck of something. You don't have to believe. I mean, not all atheists think that by the way, but it is an absurd place to get to.

Speaker 3:          00:27:19       I maintained that the reality of living on a planet in orbit around the Star in the galaxy, in a universe is so preposterous and bizarre and strange that it doesn't matter if you call it, you know, big thunder, God in the sky, and it doesn't matter if you're, you know, you, you, you have some mythology attached to it. Your reality is your perceptions, your own perceptions of it are so abstract. Yep. There's so not, that's not something. Even if you'd have to have fucking been to space, you'd have to have to go to a planet or at least orbit the moon or something. Just really wrap your fucking head around the fact that there's some other shit out there. It just seems like you're telling me it, but it's abstract. I know the numbers. Hundreds of billions of galaxies. Fourteen billion. I know the numbers. They're abstracting.

Speaker 3:          00:28:09       It sounds to me it doesn't sound real. I think that's religion sounds equally abstract. You know, you, you can believe in, and I'm not comparing science, religion and sciences, you know, been measured and it makes sense. Most of religion is silly, but I think to us, I just saying, I think to us the reality of our situation is so preposterous that it's almost like religion had to be put in place to describe it. It really makes you wonder like how quickly people came, became conscious because like, all this stuff was shit we had to deal with like really early on, you know, like we, where are we? What's going on, where is this from? And then, you know, Bill weld the thunder. God came down from the sky and like we had to like really early on, had to come up with some fucking answers.

Speaker 4:          00:29:00       That's one of the cool things about Buddhism is that it doesn't have like a thunder. It doesn't talk about a thunder God or something. It's more like someone recognizing that is whatever these absurd beings are on this planet. We all kind of share the same similar problems. There we are all sharing the same similar problems and then an analysis of those problems created like the system of Buddhism, which is a way to overcome the thing that's trying to make you buy a shitload of purses and cars and the thing that's making you miserable while you're laying in your fucking nice bed in your apartment. It's acknowledging that if you're fucking hunting, hunting bears is a native American or if you're lying in your fucking bed is a modern pepperoni stuffed rich man. You both have the same problem, which is you're going to die. You're going to get old, you're going to get disease.

Speaker 4:          00:29:53       You're going to get old age, disease and death. This is an inevitability that we all share in that all humans have shared since the beginning of time. You can't escape it. So the cool thing about Buddhism is it's not like if you have prayed to the mighty loon loon, you'll get a blessing. It's like, alright, let's sober up. Can we calm down? Can we overcome all the fucking distractions that are surrounding us? Can we focus our will to a point where we're no longer being buffeted by circumstances like all of our ancestors app? And that's enlightenment, man. When you wake up and you overcome the fucking

Speaker 2:          00:30:27       sort of a, you know, I mean, is it real enlightenment? No, it's, it's, it's, you're, you're sort of managing your situation. You're sort of reacted dealing realistically with what does that even mean? What inevitable? What is the inevitable? What is the death? You know, you're just, all you know is that this ends. You don't even know what, what takes place next, if anything, you know nothing. And for a lot of people just that I think was too much and people also have that natural primate need to be right. The need to follow the Alpha need to have someone who seems to be the leader of the gang and it's, it's almost impossible to do that unless you got a religion rock and it's really hard. It's really hard unless you have not just a guy, but a guy who appeals to the gods and you know, an intermediary. Someone who's like, God's manager makes it's way easy to run shit because you're like way closer to God.

Speaker 4:          00:31:22       It's a funny. I mean, it's the greatest trick ever. If you drink a bunch of people to think that you're the one who can communicate with God, like, yeah, I wrap it up,

Speaker 2:          00:31:30       but it does represent God as every cult not pulled that move. I mean, that's like everyone. People want to believe Shit, man. There's a lot of people don't want to believe shit. You could start a cult for real. Yeah, easily. Oh No. I'd never started call. Of course you would never start a call, but you could start a call if you want to do. If you were a crazy person, you'd be really good at it. You think so? Oh yeah. That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me. You looked like Manson. You could totally do it. You're a charismatic guy. You're very intelligent. You're right. You can spin a yarn, you all their prerequisites for someone being a cult leader.

Speaker 4:          00:32:02       Right? Yeah. You know, I think that it would be much more fun to, um, to just be part of what's actually happening on the planet.

Speaker 2:          00:32:10       Yeah. To be part of that, that's a massive distraction. To be in a cult of work. Way more confusing and get the work running a colt man. It's like, that's a lot of fucking organization. It would be terrible. I'd have sex. I bet though you would have, but it's all tricks. Sex. Let me tell you something. Only sex you want in life period. Unless you just, unless you just got to get a hooker and you just to get your Dick sucked, period. You know, you're just a guy who just never gets laid and you got to do. You got to do. Other than that,

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       what you really want, ideally sex with people want to have sex with you. You don't want that trick sex, you know that I'm the Messiah. Tricks acts. We're going to get mad at you, man. Somewhere along the line someone's going to get mad at you. You should only have sex with people that genuinely want to have sex. Have you? Have you ever had payments? Sex, like where you did something and they felt like they had to have sex with, just as a payment. That was, that was, that was the worst. Why? What did you, what did change the story a little bit. It's a girl that wanted me to do some stuff for her and so I did it for just thinking like I thought she was just cute, but then right when it was done, she's just like, okay, and she comes into the next room, just takes off her clothes and I'm.

Speaker 5:          00:33:21       And I'm like, Oh fuck Ya. And I fucker. And then then she left and then we later she wanted to do some more stuff and so I did it and she goes, look, I'm on my period right now after I was done with it. She goes, I'm on my period right now, but it kind of gets you the next time. And I'm like, okay, she needs to tell her about money. Yeah. Can I get so wow. You know, we should have had this conversation off the air. I want to know who the fuck this is. Um, yeah. You give me a hint now you wouldn't know. I would have to explain it or you'd be like, Eh, I eventually you. Oh yeah, yeah. Is this a long time ago this happened or. Yeah, it's like seven years ago. Wow. That's funny. I've never, I've never had that happen before.

Speaker 5:          00:34:01       I've never had that. But I have lent money in the past to people at dated. Yeah. But it's never really alone. They mostly hate doing that though. I've noticed that people hate that man. People hate. They hate when they're stuck. They hate when they have no one to turn to. You know, all of a sudden like, your bills are piling up and you fucking transmission brakes and you literally can't get to work. That happens to be super normal. It happens all the time. You know, sucks. People hate to be in a position. Most people do. The people who liked to be in a position to ask people for money all the time, those are a pain in the ass, you know, and especially, you know, dudes who just always seem to be in a spot where you never can get out of this. I always in a bind what it was.

Speaker 5:          00:34:43       What do you, why are you spending so much for all your on this house? Why is this car so much when you're broken that you're always needing money? Dude, you gotta manage your situation. You know, if you want better things in life, you've got to make more money. Man. You can't like pretend you had more. Part of it is credit, credit, credit, credit. No one's forcing you to tell you what, how you in credit cards so you, you, you, you, you're a broke person being a waiter and you're making shit. No money, but you want a new TV. You run it. You see all your friends have tvs. What we just talked about, silly, but what sucks is that that it should be fair for credit card companies to charge like what they're doing now up to 30, 30 percent or something like that. That's criminal. I mean that's, that's, that should be against the law. Totally criminal and most people pay the minimum and you'll pay that off for the rest of your life and you're just keep paying them and you'll know you will have paid so much more money than you spent. It's criminal, but dude, a lot of people are in a trans man. A lot of people are in a serious fucking trans and

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       like,

Speaker 6:          00:35:39       Oh

Speaker 7:          00:36:22       sure,

Speaker 2:          00:36:27       change the environment of the show. It's just like that amazing lane that was. We did a podcast with Brendan loss and they do that every episode where they do that. They do things like that. Like they sit there for like five minutes, like making crazy noises for no reason at all. I didn't know where. I bet that would be a funny podcast because Brendan Walsh is a funny motherfucker. This one guy, by the way, there's a podcast whole network of um, called death squad that were also involved in Brian runs all of them and they're all on itunes and all for free and they include the ice house chronicles, which I think is one of the best podcasts we do and what the icehouse chronicles is. We're actually going to do one after I do this podcast with Duncan and what is, is while the show was going on at the ice house, we also come over here and we fuck around and talk shit and have a podcast, a lot of fun and it's a real green room.

Speaker 2:          00:37:17       Like it's an actual green room of the show. Like you'll see people saying like, Oh shit, am I on my own now? And then they'll run out of the room and go onstage. It's, it's really cool. I like that, that Paul Provenza show, the green room I enjoyed. I enjoy whenever you can get, you know, Stan hope and Dave attell and Janeane Garofalo in a room together and let them argue. Jamie Kilstein, whoever was in that, you know, I, I enjoy that, but this is a real green room of a real show of a bunch of guys who worked together on a regular basis and you're not going to get any weird awkwardness or people you know, that are attacking people. Most of it is just a lot of fun with occasionally Brian, we'll bring someone in here and fuck. Are these people Brian Case we've had only four major instances, but those have been love those.

Speaker 2:          00:38:05       They love those moments. Yeah. We've got a few incidents where Brian brought people in and be like, this person, she can't talk anymore. Brian, like, Hey, get out of here. I can't tell you but this, you know, he knows people in that shit. Some shady businesses keep on running into shady shit. Shitty Shit. Yeah, that's a lot of it. I think it might in the future, like I'm ready to completely do something. I thought about this the other day. I'm ready date somebody that I would have dated when I was 21, like like when I was 21, I was date someone that you should be dating when you're 37. The crazier asshole. Even scarier. Thirty seven year olds in Los Angeles. That's the scariest bottom of the weird. Sometimes for the most part the is really bad times. It's like you and sometimes it's like Duncan. Sometimes it's a guy or girl for you who's at a certain point in their life has actually learned a lot of shit and it's actually fun to be around.

Speaker 2:          00:39:00       We all assume chauvinistically as men, especially that when you meet a girl that's in their late thirties, she just going to be a fucking wreck. She goes to screaming wreck of desperation and fear and blame my age. Want to make babies quick so they trick you. They try to play exactly who they think you want you to be interested in me. Yeah, I know someone who absolutely unquestionably was tricked. The girl he was dating was older and they like right away, started dating and she said that she was on the pill and she got off the pill immediately. She immediately knew that she was only like, I think she was like 35 or 36, which is. Well, that's where it gets with women. Not all women, obviously most of them that aren't deceptive, but where it gets with some women it's like, listen, I don't give a fuck what he wants.

Speaker 2:          00:39:50       I only get one more shot at this. I'm not going to be in some sort of relationship with some guy by the way, who has plenty of money so he can take care of this thing. Even if the kid doesn't work out, this is what I want. I want a child. This guy's got money, he's got genetics, and they'll just take the loads. They'll just take the loads and you have to pretend that you have to somehow or another, you know, you have to. If you're, if you're having sexually or when you're not wearing a condom, you know, you have to realize that that's a possibility that someone could do that and it's totally illegal by the way she can do that. And you know, even if she was deceptive, I don't think she could lose in court. I think she could probably say it's her business.

Speaker 2:          00:40:27       You know, I, I think you're, you're, whether or not you took the pills. Anybody ever sued someone based on whether or not they took the pill. The pill is like they say it's 99 percent effective. I bet it's 100 percent effective. Just one people. Such wretched line cons. It's unprovable in court. You know, it's very possible that the pill is just straight up affective. Would you ever get your shit a snipped, like maybe save some sperm that. Yeah. Did he say to you the sperm also a no. He did not say I save your spring break. That could be reversed, but doug's loads at this point or to fucking completely useless. His loads will come out like a wet cardboard. There's no way they're impregnating anybody getting reversed. This has this weird visual that your penis would be just so broken looking. No, it's not. You're paying this. It's under something with your balls. You know, you wouldn't even see that. But the innards man, that's what's really crazy. Trying to reattach a tube and it might not work. It might not take. Yeah. This is like the worst felony. Well, there's another way of doing it. That is another way of doing it. There's a new way. Um, I saw online where they're doing it now with like a clip there actually bending it

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       and pinching it and cutting off with a clip. And the idea behind the clip is that it could be reversible, but I always think that like, you know, you're doing Jujitsu and some guy goes neon belly on you, hard pops your fucking flip out. And next thing you know, well listen man, that's the reality. You get a big guy on you. And so I control neon bellies and motherfucker. Dude, it's, you got to have tight abs. I do. I do my sit ups. That's what I think. I don't want to get stuck with some big fucking guy, neon belly. That's what I do. That's what I think of when I'm doing my setups. Ups, you just gave me an anxiety attack. I don't get anxiety attacks. Just do sit ups with 25 pound plates while you're hanging by your ankles. This is what you do. Took a 25 pound plate. You put it by your chest and you hang by your ankles and just all the way you're fucking slow control at Dunkin, even if you only do one. How to keep me from having an illegitimate child choice stomach muscles.

Speaker 3:          00:42:25       I'm going to teach you about bald eagles. That's the next thing I'm going to teach you about how to Cagle your boss. You know women do eagles to keep their. Their pussy tight. Apparently you could do that to Kohl's just from down. Shut the floors. It's a really weak muscle. If you try to squeeze your Dick Muscle right now as you're sitting here, just going to try to. It's so weak. I have no dick squeezing endurance at all. That's why when you, when you're, when you have to come, you don't want to come. It's so hard, you know, when, when you're like, don't fucking move, don't move and just grab her and hold her in place to move and you're going crazy and it just forget it. That's when load sneak out and that's how people get pregnant. Do you believe the idea? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:43:08       that I'm like the galleries in the tantric sex, people believe that you actually lose energy when you come, like if you come too much, you're losing some form of energy. Now. Like some boxers, they won't ejaculate like before a fight, but they won't have sex before a fight because they want to.

Speaker 3:          00:43:26       Well, they've actually proven physiologically proven that if you don't have any release within seven days, your testosterone goes up significantly. Significantly. Like measurably, I think. I don't remember the actual number, but it was enough so that it would. It would warrant doing that if you were a fighter, but for some fighters there, the difficult thing is relaxing. The difficult thing is getting in there and being able to fight up to your potential. It's not the amount of testosterone that you're producing, it's how well are you in control of your mind because your mind is what's going to guide you through this fucking thing. Your mind is going to have to deal with the consequences of nipples come and flying at your face and jumping knees and dudes try to take you down to try to throw you literally on your head. Your mind is dealing with all this and your mind has gotta be on point and your mind has got to be relaxed enough to not freeze up, relax enough to respond to the pressure and do the smart thing and not not get exhausted quickly because of anxiety. That's a big problem with guys. They're mine gets them so like this that their bodies like, I can't do this anymore because they're so

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       inefficient. They're so completely inefficient in their use of their body that everything is a is a strain and everything is a sprint and they become exhausted like almost immediately. Yeah. Learning to get in that fucking statement. By the way, I was. What I was saying is in that case, I would say that you should have sex because then you're not going to at least think about the sex because if you're not having sex, you're built up with those testosterone and you're just thinking about pussy and are so confused. You might not even be able to be comfortable in their you. It might not be able to like get loose in there, you know? Whereas if you're, if you get it out of your system, you get the sex that you're still going to be, you still feel great. I mean, I mean, how much of an effect does it have on you?

Speaker 2:          00:45:10       It doesn't have an effect on you where you go to the gym and your week. Now I'm at sex and go the gym and I feel great. It's not that much of a problem. I think for a lot of guys you'd be better off just having a sex to calm down. Get it out of your system. Yeah. I look at it, I'm like, don't ask me man. Like I, I, maybe you can go like four days without jerking off. I'm not having sex the mud, so I have no idea the whole here's the perfect mystery to me, Taoism and the whole contract thing. I just don't know if it's something I wonder about because it's two systems that both, you know, have really developed systems around this idea of like extending your orgasm. Like somehow they can like supposedly make their orgasms lasts much, much, much sting.

Speaker 2:          00:45:52       Isn't that right? But you would think we would be like really that in tune with everything is fucking songs we better lately. Right. You know, like a long time ago, they were awesome. You know, the old sting. What was the last time sting had a good new song. Does he have songs anymore? Songs I heard that were new that came out while I was playing a gravy or whatever. That's field the gravy. Well him and his wife, they have like these 30 minute sessions, but where's your music bro? Why? You know, I mean it. Was he putting out music that I'm not aware of. Did you say 30 minute? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It was like crazy tantric orgasms where they last minute orgasm. Yeah. Yeah, for real or imagined the smell on that. What do you think?

Speaker 2:          00:46:35       Hey, what do you think would happen if you had a 24 hour orgasm feel great. I think I would suck. I take you. I think. I don't know, man. Do you think it would be wasted? You'd be exhausted by the time was over, but yeah, probably feel great. Can you mentioned trying to eat while having an orgasm, like you're at subway train order. That'd be embarrassing. It would be the worst thing would be the worst drug. He'd always be around people coming like wherever, like you'd go to parties and everyone's just sat on the couch having orgasms. That's totally possible. By the way, that's not like a really difficult thing to represent chemical. I bet. Yeah. I don't think it is. I think they could come up with an orgasm pill that's around the corner. No one ever would have thought a hard dick pill would have been feasible or achievable so quickly and easily.

Speaker 2:          00:47:17       No plague of so many fucking think how hard it would have been to have an erection. When you're looking down at your wife's flea covered pussy that hasn't had a shower and yeah, there's no showers. It could even be if they bathed, you had to get like buckets of water. He had to bring them by the river. By the time you get to go over and over again to probably take you an hour and a half each fucking trip back and forth, back and forth. I'll get the rest of it tomorrow. Then what do you do? You boil the water. What's going on there? Or just take an ice cold bath. Yeah. Then you draw your dirty ass off on some fucking skin. Still Gross. Dirty again? Yeah. What did people smell like back there?

Speaker 2:          00:48:04       What if it balanced out? If like all the bacteria in your body will just fight each other off until it got to like a balanced warfare state. You know, the issue with us is that we clean our skin so much that we lose a lot of the healthy bacteria outside of your skin. That's one of the, uh, problems with people that have A. I'm obsessive compulsive and they have to clean everything. What is that? A phobia? What is it called when you're afraid of germs? Yeah. Howie Mendell gets warts on his hands apparently. Yeah, because he uses that hand cleaner so much. It's heavy. It's getting worse. It's getting worse. Somebody. We had a podcast the other day where somebody knew he won't even touch knuckles with you anymore. He used to touch knuckles, but now he won't even do that. You know what, man, we've already talked about this, but when you consider how filthy the assholes and most people in the western world are, it kind of makes sense man, because like we've sort of using toilet paper to wipe your.

Speaker 2:          00:48:58       You're using toilet paper. Yes. That is gross. But being such a Germaphobia is preposterous because we are not one thing. We're terrified of these germs, but we have germs in us. We are germs. You know we're not just one thing. You should clean your hands. Yes, for sure. You should definitely wash your dishes. You should clean your ass. You should, but you also shouldn't be a fucking freak. Don't, don't be crazy about it. Don't be afraid to touch a table because somebody might have touched it before. You just wash your goddamn hands in each vegetables so they know. They say, I think, I mean I get given Duncan a couple stink watches before where you don't wash your finger and then when you shake hands you just kind of rub it on the inside of their hand right here and it makes it smell food. Ah Jeez man.

Speaker 5:          00:49:41       You guys were talking about on your podcast. It's you asshole Brian. It just is asking know what I do. He sits there and watches his asshole for sure. And that's completely false. The you have your asshole and I'm saying, I'm saying you. I'm saying. I'm saying you. I'm saying I know you have itched your asshole by mistake before or at least at least once or twice in life. Right? Make sure that if I do have to itch my asshole that I wash my hands afterwards. I am not convinced that you do the same. See that. See, that's right there is just spreading false information because. Do you think I really. It's my ass and it smells good. No, but I do everything that if you were tired did you didn't feel like getting up to go wash your hands and your asshole, you would hit your

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       asshole for sure and then go right back to keyboard. No, I would suck it all and wipe it on my shirt. Disgusting Man. Thirty seven year old man whose name is red band. We need a commercial. The adventures of red band. The avengers or band made up by you because that was all bullshit. You. You know, you. You cry sensitive, but you're the one who wants to interrupt podcasts with digging your asshole stories and that's how it got started in the first place you had a podcast. We had a podcast where you jumped in the middle of it and started talking about you actually getting shit. You guys tends because you were talking about that and that's why you said it. I don't believe we were, but the point is you cannot bring to it. You guys were just talking about is you cannot bring something like that up.

Speaker 2:          00:51:12       Yep. That preposterous. And then be sensitive about people talking about you itching your asshole and having shit. Although not the only reason I said that is because I heard you talk about it on Dunkin's podcast that I did this when in fact I didn't do this. So who did it? Your asshole. I said I have inched my asshole. When you judge. It's not sure asshole. You cannot be judgmental about guys talking about you itching your asshole. Do you not understand that you opened up a door? It's like you fit your asshole to. Yes, exactly. Then what's the big deal? I told you I washed my hands and I did and I never said I didn't. You are a guarantee you. So I didn't say I wash my hands. I didn't wash my hands. It's your asshole. And then typing. All right. If you only had like three more words type, you would definitely go.

Speaker 2:          00:51:59       Well, wash my hands in a little bit and just I'll remember to wash this keyboard off. I'll make up some shit about you. Now listen, Brian, want to talk about itching your asshole and getting shit on it. You cannot be sensitive about that, man. That's silly. Look, you live not itched. Your asshole problems are subject. It becomes a subject. Then it becomes fun. You can't have you guys here if you're an asshole, right? Yes. How am I any different? Because I talked about it. Yes, because I'm sorry for that. Just based on your normal behavior that I. it's possible. It's a possible example that you could invest your asshole and then not gone to the bathroom and washed it. It was very possible. That's very possible. So that's what we made fun of, Dude. So fucking relax. Now you're saying it as if I did though.

Speaker 2:          00:52:46       You said on your podcast. I heard what we said to you. It's your asshole. And then didn't wash and then touching everything. Yeah, that's what we said. That's possible. That's why it's funny. Okay. We don't know. Obviously we weren't there while you were itching. Your asshole and touching things. It's called goofing on you. You can't goof on yourself in front of us like that and then expect us not to also do the same thing. If there's anything that we grew fond about ourselves during the podcast, feel free to goof on it about us. We're not here. I mean if you're doing it yourself, you can't be upset that other people are doing it. You're talking about digging your asshole, getting shit all over your hands. You cannot be upset at other people. Laughing about that. If you want to. Look, I've talked about the podcast, about shitting my pants.

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       I Shit my pants driving home from fear factor once. Shit my fucking pants plop filled them up. Just just held it in as long as I can, but I was like, oh, just I couldn't. I couldn't hold it anymore. I was stuck in traffic. It was. It was a horrible diarrhea moment. Feel free to make fun of that because it actually did happen. I actually did have to clean my car. I actually did have to clean my pants is that shit. Didn't get into my car, but my pants were soaking wet with shit, so that kind of leaked through some of the fabric and got all over my seats so I had to get in there with windex. I used an old toothbrush and shit's disgusting. That's real, so you can make fun of that and when you started talking about digging in your ass and getting shit all over your hands, guess what?

Speaker 2:          00:54:06       Fela, we're going to joke about it. You can't be all sensitive about that silly bitch. No, but I've heard you said or did, and this is just. I didn't even listen to the podcast. What I heard you said is you're saying you're telling that Brian stopped down. Then stop now. If you didn't listen to the podcast, stop now. Don't ever. Don't ever comment on something, especially in an angry way and not even coming in angry and you're asking why I brought it up and that. I'm telling you why I brought it up because I heard recently he were saying that I did that. That's how you asked how I brought up the situation that I randomly threw in something about what you were talking about it. It was a very similar, what you guys were trying to settle the fundus explained to him. I said, attack you barely on me, man.

Speaker 2:          00:54:44       No, I'm not crying. You're being defensive about the fact that we were joking around about you itching, you're being defensive. You asked me why I randomly brought up the fact and I was telling you, we'll certainly are being defensive and arguing about right now is very child like that is very defense. Did you see a dead mouse and Madonna? Yes, I did. That's crazy. What do you think about this? Well, dead mouse is a silly bitch. He was making fun of Madonna because Madonna, Madonna, like in, you know, people at my message board with totally ragging on her for her attempted being relevant, you know, she gets on stage like who here has seeing molly? Molly is a nickname for MDM, which is her new album, isn't it or is that a DNA? Yeah, but it's written kind of. So she's just trying to. She's trying to pump up our album.

Speaker 2:          00:55:27       Yeah, I mean that's part of her thing is connecting ourselves to this very, very popular rave drug. So I'm dead mouse gets a mad about it and he gets pissed at her and saying, you know, her daughter, you know you're connecting drugs. So the electronic dance music movement, and you shouldn't do that. No, you don't need his ideas. You don't need drugs to enjoy that move. The, the, the, uh, the music that he's making or any of those artists are making, which is true. You do not need drugs to do that. I mean, I've listened to stuff and I enjoyed it and I wasn't. I wasn't on drugs. If you took Mtma he's, he doesn't have any experience in it. So that's why it's ridiculous. So for him to say that, it's like, man, you're, you're, you're talking shit about an experience that for some people is maybe the most energetic and positive experience I've ever had in their life is being high on ecstasy at a rave. Listening to dance, music, food, being an excellent mgma and standing in front of a speaker the size of a house blasting

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       out fucking awesome house music. There's nothing like that. It's a cool. That's the best. That's what most people go to see that music, you know, on. And Molly, that's the whole point of listening to the music. But what he's saying is it's giving his electronic music a bad name, you know, like you don't have to enjoy listening to that kind of music on my. But I think that's ridiculous. That's like saying reggae music without marijuana. That's like saying like rap without stealing a car. You're certainly not going to. That is something I remember that that was like back in the day when I used to go to the Raves, that was like one section of people who would go to go to the res and a very small one. We're a group of like connoisseurs of the music who didn't think that you should pollute your mind with the drugs and just enjoy purely enjoy the music. Well, the problem is we had dead mouse on the podcast. He was drunk as fuck and he wouldn't stop smoking cigarettes. He

Speaker 3:          00:57:16       chain smoke cigarettes and he was drunk as fuck. And I enjoyed hanging out with them. Don't get me wrong, I like to do it, but I think he's, I think his whole thought processes is really. It's uninformed. And I think if he had experiences with psychedelic drugs and music, I mean not that MDM is a psychedelic and you can be happened once that happened, I think is what they call it, but it's impactful. It is what it is. It, it has a Mtma had a very strong influence on my behavior. It gave me a very, very deep insight into behavior patterns and insecurity. I said on my message board, it was like, I think he could use some Mtma. I really think it could, you know, not that he's a bad guy, but I think that there's a lot of, a lot of people, they have a certain amount of unnecessary anger inside of them, a certain amount of unnecessary judgment and Mtma will knock that shit right out of you. It's such a loving feeling and that's one of the reasons why they're using it for posttraumatic stress disorder, for, for vets coming back from, from Iraq and Afghanistan. And that's, that's a positive thing, man. That's a good thing. Our people abusing it and dancing. Of course they are. But that goes back to what I said in that movie, the Union people can abuse cheeseburgers. Should we make cheeseburgers illegal? I can take a fork and stick in my eyes. She would make fortunately.

Speaker 4:          00:58:31       Do you know how many people a year die from drinking? The statistic is 100,000. Yeah, between 70 and 100. And that

Speaker 3:          00:58:37       doesn't even include drunk driving deaths. By the way, the desk themselves to death. People die from alcohol poisoning. People died from overdosing on alcohol. People die from sclerosis of the liver directly related to alcoholism. But MTMA is a small amount. It's like illegal drugs in this country is only like 12,000 people die here. The real problem is prescription drugs right now, which you're overcoming drunk driving accidents. And as far as fatalities, oh my God. Those are the words. People die from those left and right. Man. I have a friend who died, but I have a friend who died in New York, a pool player, and he was a great guy and a straight edge. He was straight edge, made fun of people smoke cigarettes, and then all of a sudden he hurt his back and when he hurt his back, he had a. He got on some oxycodones or one of those and just that was it ya. Bye Bye. Trains changes. Life fell asleep and his mashed potatoes. Everyone's hanging out together. The fucking. I just falls asleep. Sitting there eating dinner, plopped down, sat like a movie plot, puts his arm down and falls asleep on a plate.

Speaker 4:          00:59:34       So sad dude. It's the saddest thing ever, man. It really is. It's sad. It's really sad when you consider that these drugs, these synthetic drugs that people are, that are killing so many people are semi legal. Alcohol is killing everybody and it's totally legal. Whereas these empath and an empathogen like Mtma that when you take it, you can. If you have some discipline, you can go dancing. It's fun to go dancing on it, but if you have some discipline, you can shift your life into the positive forever. Yes. If you have some discipline and if you're working with someone or if you're. If you know what you're doing,

Speaker 3:          01:00:07       well, if you're honest with your about your experience of your person who's truly looking to improve who you are as a person, I think NBM Mtma can be very impactful. I didn't like the way it made me feel. I wouldn't recommend anybody doing it. I would say, man, you have to weigh your pros and cons. Even though it impacted me in a very positive way. I remember feeling absolutely terrible the next day. I don't think it's good for your body. I don't want to do it again just, but I learned a lot from doing it and the fact that oxycontin's, which are literally synthetic, Carolyn, literally this, that is what it is. There's no data. It is a synthetic opiate. It is incredibly, incredibly addictive. People who've done heroin say it's easier to kick heroin than it is to kick pills. The oxycontin pills somehow or another, and the way they're constructed, the way it impacts with the human body makes them even more addictive. It's just insanity.

Speaker 4:          01:00:55       Well, they're fucking fish hooks, dude. There fish hooks coming out of the pharmaceutical companies to get stuck in people's brains. You get a fucking fish hook in your brain attached to a giant corporation. It's got you fucking wired in whether you're getting it legally or not. It's like telephone wires all connecting back to the telephone company from the brain's all these pill poppers. It's just fucking lines going back.

Speaker 3:          01:01:18       No benefit whatsoever except a little bit of pain relief. The benefit social, the social benefit of MTMA would be gigantic. Madison County and maybe Kim legal. You imagine that it was prescribed, but the problem is also, you know, you got people who would oh, on and people who drink when they take the, there's a, there's a lot of different possibilities. People could fuck it up.

Speaker 4:          01:01:37       Yeah, they can fuck it up. And guess what? They get to you because their, it's their life and their.

Speaker 3:          01:01:41       Yes, and they can do that with alcohol and they can do the, you know, the fact that there's all these laws against things like MDM and mushrooms and things in mushrooms are worth, really gets crazy because you can't overdo, you know, who the fuck has ever overdosed on mushrooms. You have to take, you have to eat like pounds of it. The ld 50 rate for for mushrooms is really high. Like you, you got to be really trying to garbage bag. I think it's like a garbage, which by the way is you could eat way less salt and you'd be dead. You know, you get eat like you don't even have to eat a pound of salt. You're fucking gone man. You Ain't coming back. You know, you try to have, you ate a pound of salt and just sat there with a tablespoon and just started eating salt. You had a whole pound bag. That's it. That's a wrap kid. You're dead. You're dead. Yeah. You could die from drinking water. Remember we were in Sacramento and that lady died and a contest. The contest. It's so sad that happened to a frat kid too. They were, um, there were a hazing, a frat kid. They made him drink water until he couldn't drink anymore. He fucking died too.

Speaker 4:          01:02:38       Die. Yeah. It's so fucked up, man. It's a terrible way.

Speaker 3:          01:02:41       Go. Weird laws that protect people. Cigarettes being legals, the most preposterous

Speaker 4:          01:02:47       but, and also remember like the impulse for many people are taking psychedelics is not to try to wipe out the universe, but it's to try to go deeper into the universe. And so that means that a lot of people in the jails right now and a lot of people in the dungeons, they had the same instincts is like a lot of the great philosophers. They just wanted to expand their mind and understand a little bit about the universe and they're in prison now. They're imprisoned and so from the prohibition, you're not just getting an inability to go enjoy a great fucking night at some underground party or the inability to like have a great camping trip with your pals. It's literally, I think, stifling evolution because God knows what amazing thoughts people could be coming up with if there was a regulated psychedelics that and we got to explore them to understand how to really use them and how to really fucking a harness them to make us smarter.

Speaker 4:          01:03:41       You know, this is something that's the birthright of humanity. All indigenous tribes have some form of psychedelic that they take. This is like the ancient people of the earth knew about this pot Iowasca. Yet somehow in the modern age, they're keeping us from this experience that maybe is the thing that connected the native Americans to the earth that you were talking about in the beginning. Maybe it is the thing that made people not so fucking fixated on material possessions, you know, but it's white. We have a prohibition happening now. It's the dark ages. It's like, imagine if there was a book, just some book and inside of it was amazing information that will teach you how to overcome your ego, that will connect you with your brothers and sisters around you. There's this amazing book and it's surrounded by a fence that the governments are wrecked and they're like, sorry, I can't read that fucking book. Can't read it. It's illegal. You read that book. You're going to the dungeon. If we catch you distributing this book, copies of this book, we put you in the dungeon. Doesn't make any sense, man. Why aren't they letting us read that fucking book? I don't know anyone who died on mushrooms. I don't know anyone where anything bad happen to them on mushrooms. Nobody. I've never heard it. I'm sure it's out there, but

Speaker 3:          01:04:49       I don't. I've never heard that. I've heard a lot of things bad on mushrooms. All those people were all bitches. Every person I've ever met that had like a horrible trip on mushrooms. They all had like psychological shit. They were dealing with

Speaker 4:          01:05:00       five bad problems. I got sick. I was shitting myself. Oh well that's possibly food poisoning. Most looks. Bad trips I think are overdosing. I think that's all it is. There's an overdose of how much mushrooms

Speaker 8:          01:05:18       you should have based on how much you ate that day. How much. I don't know. All the factors needs to be regulated because then it can be dispensed like synthetic I've, but we're talking about, um, the whole idea behind the fact that these drugs, like cocaine are illegal, is what keeps them from being impure. Know everyone, cuts them up. Everyone adds all this stuff to them. You couldn't do that if it was sold by Coca Cola. Coco was selling cocaine. Sure you know, you, you, you would have to have the ingredients listed right there on it. You would know exactly what it was. You, they would have to sell your actual cocaine, you know, but when you buying it from some fucking kid at a rave, you, he's calling it Mtma. Hope he's right. You don't know. You're taking a chance. You want to party, you want to have a good time.

Speaker 8:          01:05:59       Who knows what the fuck it is. It's like what your idea is, was talking about with the cocaine the other day. That's what I just said. Oh, Jesus Christ. You don't even listening. That's what we were actually saying. That's the subject we were talking, dude, if I did, if I had a time machine, Rogan and I could go back in time, one of my stops on the way back to the crucifixion would be to fucking pick up a cocaine laden bottle of Coca Cola. Haven't you always wondered what that was like to drink at cocaine? Cocaine, coke, do it. It's got to be. Well, when we say cocaine, this is also. We talked about this in the podcast or stayed the coca leaf. The chewing of the coca leaf has a very complete. It's a very different reaction than I'm eating and by the way, a coca leaves are still in Coca Cola.

Speaker 8:          01:06:44       A lot of people don't know, but yeah, you, they still important. Even though cocoa leaves are illegal, they still import coca leaves to using Coca Cola. I might be talking on my end. I think they changed the formula for that for a long time ago. I don't know. Is that when they showed it was like the 20th or something like that? Yeah. No, no. I think it was like a long, long time ago. Not sure about that. Uh, I'm not sure about that, but anyway, the point is the coca leaf, which, which they, they, you know, they had, that was, that was an ingredient, right, but were they using cocaine as an ingredient or was it just the coca leaves? I don't know. I mean, it wasn't sherlock holmes addicted to cocaine and those books. I think it was a lot of guys. I thought it was morphine.

Speaker 8:          01:07:26       It wasn't a morphine. I can't remember. Is that, um, wider, wider up used to go to the morphine probably people. Well, yeah, and they had opium dens and I think Freud was really into coke. I think there were like blasting themselves with coke everywhere and I was totally illegal, like no one, it wasn't regulated back then. As far as I know. I, I think you could at least get prescriptions for it. I've seen like cool all bought. I mean if it's in fucking coke fits in Coca Cola, it's illegal. Yeah, there is actual legal people. Must've been a noxious back then. Everyone's on coke. It must've been the worst. Cocacola actually does have a legal importation of the coca leaf. I'm still. Yes, coca, coca, Coca Cola. The coke formula is one of the most closely guarded corporate secrets in America. The company can seeds that using a d,

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       cocaine, ised flavor essence in the coca leaves is one of the few coke ingredients that company will publicly acknowledged. So they are using an actual abstract of the coca leaf that has no cocaine in it.

Speaker 4:          01:08:29       So I was right. Yeah, I know that cocaine going. They're extracting.

Speaker 3:          01:08:33       Dude, who do

Speaker 5:          01:08:35       I saw goes to Elton John's. All the cocaine in the world. You imagine if Coca Cola turned out to be the number one dealer and on Earth if they're d extracting cocaine from. Where's it going? Done right away. We don't even need it. Even though the Chileans forget that money. Okay, we're here to sell kids sugary shit that makes your teeth rot out.

Speaker 3:          01:09:00       We're not here to kill anybody and the guys actually Dr Pepper the whole time. He's like scarface, character of the Coca Cola company. All you need to know about the weather or not, they would make money off of things like that is who's making money off cigarettes? Cigarettes are fucking for sure. Killing, yeah, like almost a half a million people a year in this country alone. Our ideas about intoxication are so bizarre and baffling that somehow or another we think that they are protecting us from something that perturbs our state of consciousness that makes us think about things in a completely different way and possibly even hallucinate, but some weird surge that you get because of an almost immediate addiction that you've acquired to some stupid fucking burning plant that's soaked in chemicals. No one even discusses it. It never comes up. Not at all. No campaigns ever bring it up. No one ever promised.

Speaker 3:          01:09:53       People are promising bases on the moon. Newt Gingrich got desperate and plump, promised a base on the moon. By the time he had a second term, he threw a hail Mary. It's like based on the mood. No one ever says, we need to make cigarettes illegal and save. Our friends were dying a horrible death, addicted to a terrible chemical that's sick company as profiting off, and we need to really change the way we look to change the way we look at this terrible, terrible scourge in America. No one, not, not a single politician would ever make that speech and meanwhile they did. They'd want a dead in the fucking hotel room somewhere,

Speaker 4:          01:10:27       but meanwhile, if any anyone running for president said, I think that psilocybin makes you connect with the universe and it makes you love the people around you more and it gives you more of an experience of a full life and reminds you of how small you are in relation to everything out so you can't really God on it. So I don't think it should be illegal if somebody said that. If a president said that right now, like Santorum said that, or somebody said that they would never get elected.

Speaker 3:          01:10:56       Did you say that? But I don't. I don't agree. Not only will. The only way they would never get elected is if they would never get elected anyway because elections aren't real. But could they change the public's consciousness? Absolutely depressed. But if you got an eloquent guy, well the evidence John Hopkins, the recent John Hopkins University, sure it would work a 20 year period of time. All these people that took mushrooms just once at a direct change in their personality and improvement of their personality, illegal. Of course it shouldn't be illegal, but I think that if someone was eloquent and someone made sense in all other areas, if someone was a bright person and they can prove it with data and prove it in an articulate and eloquent manner, where it was compelling were what they were telling you was that, here's what's going on. Okay, I know you're all associating drugs with being a negative thing and the reason for that.

Speaker 3:          01:11:41       It's intelligent to do so. Most drugs and many, many drugs can be very negative on your life. However, we've been sold a bill of goods on certain drugs and certain drugs are actually good for you. Not only are they good for you, they may be the whole reason we evolved from fucking monkeys in the first place, but we been lied to and the companies that keep us in order right now would like to keep everything the way it is. The reason being is they're profiting off things being illegal. There's a lot of profit on drugs being illegal that are illegal currently. It's not as simple as they would just sell them to and then they would make the money. Why wouldn't they make it legal? There is money to be made that will not be available once psychedelic drugs or illegal. There's a lot of things that are for sale, especially pharmaceutical drugs. A huge amount that just making marijuana legal would just squash the market for a good percentage of pain relief and Glaucoma medication reduces interocular pressure. P people on aids who have aids, who, uh, can eat, people on chemotherapy that have a hard time eating all of that. There's so many drugs that are prescribed for various elements that literally would be out of business.

Speaker 4:          01:12:57       So and, and, and so consider this, take it to the human level. This is where it gets fucked up. We have access to certain mind states where you can bring back authentic information. They can help your life and the life of the people around you. And there's a possibility that if enough people were having these mind states, there might be an acceleration in technology and acceleration and science and acceleration and philosophy, but because we can't get these mind states, we can't get these mind states. Things are slow and weird and dumb right now. And the reason we can't get it is so that people can make more money.

Speaker 3:          01:13:34       Okay. Well, let me play devil's advocate please. First off, there's a lot of people that think that a lot of hippies are fucking mooches. They mooch off the government, they get welfare, they get public aid, they don't want to pull their share. They don't want to pull their own weight. A lot of people think that these, these experiences that you say that will benefit people, they say, well, where's the evidence? Where's the evidence of anybody finding out anything worthwhile on, on psychedelics? Terence Mckenna? That doesn't mean anything. Francis Crick. Okay. That's a rumor after he died that was released as that. He was a deathbed confession.

Speaker 4:          01:14:07       No, he was good friends with a brave new world out as Huxley is friends with Huxley. Yeah, no,

Speaker 8:          01:14:12       it's true. It's true if you were friends with not saying, but okay, that's true that he took it, but it doesn't mean the. The, the, the, the, what the statement is, is that he discovered the double helix strand. He figured it out while he was on Lsd. That's all anecdotal. That's all deathbed confessions. He never said that anywhere. There's no. It's not written anywhere. So just in fairness, I don't think you can directly attribute that to him. I've looked at the sources for that. It's possible that he said that, but I don't think you can stay. I can. I mean, you're like in a court of law. I can't prove it, but being friends with Aldous Huxley, a manual on his deathbed, he had himself injected with like 750 micrograms of Lsd. Being friends with that guy. That's like being friends with you. You'll never haven't gotten stumped.

Speaker 8:          01:14:57       No, no, no. You're not. You're misunderstanding me. Yes. He probably did do LSD. The question is, what did he get out of it? How do you, how do you know? He didn't just hallucinate. You know, there's no evidence. There's no evidence that it helped them in any way. Do you know what I'm saying? It's not like they pulled some nothing on paper. There's nothing you can be like. Look here. There is one guy, Kerry, Kary Mullis. I'm kary Mullis. He was a Nobel prize winning chemist and he said that LSD had helped him develop a polymers chain reaction that helps amplify, amplify specific DNA sequences. And he figured that out while I was on acid. Well, there's one. So there's one. Can you. Can you read that again? What he did here? Here's the full thing. During a symposium held a for Albert Hoffman, Hoffman revealed that he was told by Nobel prize winning chemist, Kary Mullis that LSD had helped him develop the Pala polymers.

Speaker 8:          01:15:52       Pete hope I'm saying this right. P O l y m e r a s e Dot polyamorous, polyamorous. Anyway, Jamie, action that helps amplify specific DNA sequences. What does that mean? I don't know. I'm too stupid for that, but the, um, the guy said, I'm Kari Moss even admitted a. What if I had not taken lsd ever? I would. I still have invented PCR. That was the method. I don't know. I doubt it. I seriously doubt that's what I'm saying, Bro. That's what I'm saying. There's a fucking group of people who've got their fucking clause dug into the force of evolution and they're trying to hold it back. Okay. But if all the people that have done Lsd, one fucking guy says he figured once I've done lsd 100 times, I have not learned any new or not the best example, but have you learned, have you learned something about yourself personally?

Speaker 8:          01:16:44       Insight, personal insight solution. Personally member. What I'm doing though, I am playing devil's advocate. I'm a republican with shiny shoes on with black socks and you know, I'm the guy who was telling you that if you buy drugs you support terrorism. Yeah. No, no, no. You told me one guy, one guy says he invented a PCR method, which you don't even understand why I was on LSD. Okay. Okay. So we should have lsd legal because guy in d we should have all psychedelics mushrooms as well. Right. But when you start throwing it around. What about the arts? Devil's advocate. I know. No, I don't. I'm not even seeing you now. I'm just seeing what about, uh, what about the fucking art man? What a man does that not count? What, what good lsd art. Do you know of? What's the best to Jimi Hendrix glow. Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:17:34       Jimmy Hendrix is more heroin, wasn't even heroin and cocaine, wasn't he? Wasn't he a heroin guy? Purple Haze. That's purple haze. Isn't that pot dude? Jimi Hendrix was so into fucking LSD or purple haze. Is that potter? Is that it is now purple haze was asking. Well, I'm sure he did ask it. Don't get me wrong, but do you think that that's why he was so good? I mean, wasn't he like really good when he was a bad ass? Fucking gets helped him. But again, I know you're playing devil's advocate, but I'm being devil's advocate is the same thing as being friends with a pedophile. I mean, you don't want to be devil's advocate. It's the worst force in the universe and always represents everything evil and bad. No, I take the side of an argument that doesn't currently exist with this table because I'm sure somebody is screaming it out on twitter, right?

Speaker 8:          01:18:21       Devil's advocate is I, you know, I think for sure psychedelics can, uh, can help people. But what I think it is is I think essentially we have access to super computers and there's no instruction manuals laying around and there's no teachers to teach her how to use these things. So a lot of people are getting great results and they're all scattered and all over the poor and they're mixed in with psychosis and bad trips and a lot of fucking freaky, freaky things that have happened to people and they've taken the wrong shit and they got ahold of a fake computer. You know, there's a lot of people that are in that is because there's lack of regulation because there's a lack of understanding because there's a lack of appreciation for the true effects as human beings. It is absolutely preposterous. It's so many people will tell you this, Carrie, most guy or whether Francis Crick was telling you the truth or whether you're telling me the truth or I'm telling you the truth or any of us that have had really positive experiences.

Speaker 8:          01:19:13       There's there's way too many people that are saying that folks can benefit from it, for it to stay illegal. The people that are stopping it, they don't make any more sense than us. It's not like they're. They're. They're really wise and cautious and noble and loving overlords that want to protect you from your own folly. That is not what's going on because they they're. They're talking and ignorant statements. Medically. It's ignorance. There's no evidence to back up what they're saying. There's no reason that it makes sense and then when you start throwing numbers at their face like the, the amount of nonviolent drug offenders that are in jail and how preposterous it is that our society exists where a bunch of people were doing what they want to do that doesn't hurt anybody else and someone decides to lock them in a cage for it. Well, that person is who's doing more harm. The guy was smoking pot, or the person who locked him in a fucking cage destroys their life and does it because it's written on paper somewhere that that's okay. Well, that guy, a destructive. The law

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       becomes a destructive force in society, not the drug. When you say drugs, kill people and drugs, drugs are responsible for a million people in jail right now. That's why I don't do drugs. You won't get locked up. No, no, no, no. Don't put people in cages because they don't agree with you because they like something. They like it so much. They're willing to risk freedom because they found themselves in some sort of a situation when they're in an environment that they have no control over whatsoever. They were born into this, they didn't ask to be dropped into this preposterous, illogical, nonsensical, ridiculously lopsided and corrupt society, and you just accept them to comply. You just expect them to comply with these stupid fucking things that are written down on paper that everybody knows. Makes no sense. Well, that's. That's the problem. The laws are the problem.

Speaker 3:          01:20:56       The laws are destructive. The laws are anti evolutionary. The laws are they're anti enlightenment. That's the problem. It's not the drug. It's not pot. It's not mushrooms. It's the laws against pot and mushrooms. Those are a devastating aspect of our society. Those are not the fucking drugs you dummies missed it. You missed the whole thing. You're not protecting anybody. You fucks and anybody that hasn't done drugs, if you haven't done mushrooms, fucking for sure you shouldn't be a cop. No Way, man. You're going to be in position of power with a gun and making decisions and you've never done any mushrooms at all. You've never had any. Look at yourself through the eyes of alien intelligence. You've never had some objective outside the body experience analyzing all this shitty aspects of your own life. How the fuck are you growing? How are you developing? Are you crawling along and one little stumble after another and one little apology after another and one little breakup and make up cycle after another.

Speaker 3:          01:21:51       After another way, you scream insults at each other and then so I'm sorry, baby will never happen again. Have learned Milosevic. Is that what you're learning about yourself from your, your, your Shitty, lonely nights, eating TV dinners, hoping that your is going to return your pager or your text message rather so you can paint her pastors was go back in time. But that's what I'm saying, you know, getting someone to respond to you, getting somebody you know because you, you, you realized that being a cunt, you know, makes people not like you anymore. So that's how you grow up, you know, instead of like seeing it in one big burst, all leaders, all cops, all teachers, all of them should have a psychedelic experience or they don't know what the fuck they're talking about as a grown adult. If you haven't had a psychedelic experience, I look at you like you're some sort of an infant.

Speaker 3:          01:22:33       You do. Y'All look at you like your infant toddler. It's like I look at you like form illiterates. Yeah, it is. It is like a form of like awareness, illiteracy. Yeah. That, that's a, that's a great way to put it, man. Awareness, illiteracy. And it's sad that for some reason they're keeping as they're keeping so many people illiterate, but it's the practice. They are literate. That's why they're doing it. They, they are suffering under their own control and their own or most of them are. I mean there's a Texas judge who just got arrested for fucking smoking weed. Oh really? Somebody turned them in. The hotel think it's fucked up. I think things are gonna Change, man. I mean they're lying saying this is the third year letting the studies happen again. And if they're letting the studies happen again, there's some reason behind that.

Speaker 3:          01:23:13       I mean the studies are happening. They're allowing them to happen for the first time and I think 30 or 40 years they're opening them up because government is dangerously suppressive, dangerously suppressive. And not so much with civil liberties, like a or rather with medical marijuana and things along those lines. But that's because it's democratic. When the ball goes in the opposite court, think about how much power has been given to the government under this, this democratic regime. If we got another Bush Cheney, an office and they started cracking down like John Ashcroft did on the medical marijuana places and using losing blackwater to come in, mercenaries will fucking machine guns on their hips and taking all the pot and money away. If that shit starts happening again, think about how much power Obama has given the government. Its ridiculous. It's, it's, it's really disgusting and preposterous. I mean, if you look at the Huffington, Huffington Post, there's an article by this guy named Jim, Jim Garrison, and it's martial law by executive order not to be confused with Jim Garrison that thought that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't kill Kennedy.

Speaker 3:          01:24:11       You remember that guy? The prosecutor. Anyway, um, this, uh, Obama, he passed the National Defense Organization, uh, the NDA, the new executive order called um, the, uh, national defense resources preparedness, executive order. And it does the country as a whole, what the 2012 national defense authorization act to the constitution in particular, completely eviscerate any due process or judicial oversight for any action by the government deemed in the interest of national security. So they can just say something's national security. Essentially we're under martial law like they can just say, and it's up to the government now, all the, the, the checks and balances that were put in place by the constitution to ensure that there would be no corruption. There would be no ultimate power corrupting ultimately. Well, they, they've removed all that shit and you know, right now everybody's like, look, but you're fine. No one's no one's dying.

Speaker 3:          01:25:05       No, nothing's happening. The people that you say yes to today may not be the people you say yes to 10 years from now or 20 years from now and these laws are crazy. These laws are that we might as well be living in fucking North Korea and that's not ridiculous. That's not an exaggeration. These are unconstitutional laws and they're not going to stop. Now. They're going to go more and more and more and more control until ultimately the government, which is by the way a approved the idea of sending drones. They're going to within the bike, I think it was 12, 20, they're going to have a 2020 rather. They're going to have 30,000 drones in the sky, but North America. Awesome. Come up constantly watching everything you do. Well. Did you. Have you seen that youtube video of this swarms of quadcopters? Have you seen that? No. Dude, look that at Google Quadra. Pull it up, right? Holy Shit Man. This is it. So there are these things called quadra copters that they're working on that are just like exactly like the toys that you see, but much smaller. These fucking things man, they can like

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       they move information. It says video of them flying information. Just this swarm of tiny little nano or a tiny quadra copters they can like they give like turned sideways to go through windows. They're like, they can go anywhere man. So and. But the scary thing that I never considered was that they can fucking fly information. That's where it gets weird when you imagine like just seeing like a swarm of these things descending around your house or fluids checking you out on the street. You're just walking. We're just walking down the street and they come and like buzzing. Do a quick facial scan to get your fucking face. Match it up with like whatever facebook's doing, Bang, you know, like. So yeah. So privacy is a, um,

Speaker 3:          01:26:46       it's an escaping thing. It's on its way out. But the problem is the government, these consultant running things are gonna have so much more power than the average citizen. We're going to be under the rule of an oppressive government that has the law on their side because they changed all the fuck on paper. They changed all the stupid shit that's written down that allows them to do cunty things. They changed it all and they put it all in their defense. And essentially what they did is the United States is now under martial law, but there's no emergency, no emergency. It doesn't have to have a national emergency. Did just be under martial law. Now we're just under martial law. Why? Why is that? What the fuck is going on? Part of it has got to be because they're losing control. That's got to be part of it. They feel like the Internet and all this anonymous shit and the hackers and occupied. It's like, what is this? Spell it out for him. Tell him.

Speaker 4:          01:27:32       I think it's q u, a d, r a copter. That's what it is. Quadra Copter, swarm. Maybe someone will tweet it. Someone tweeted it to me. It freaked me out for a week. I showed it to. I showed it to Eddie Bravo at the UFC and his face went white. He just was like, what the fuck?

Speaker 3:          01:27:50       Swarm of Nana quadros. That's it. It's Nano. Quad raters.

Speaker 4:          01:27:55       Yeah. There we go. Oh Shit. Look at that. Just watch it gets better. That's just one of these fucking things. Get Ready, man. Those things are probably going to eat your baby one day. Ooh. That sound. When you hear that sound, you know you're about to get busted.

Speaker 6:          01:28:17       Whoa.

Speaker 3:          01:28:18       They just fly around and maneuver.

Speaker 6:          01:28:20       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:28:20       I'm surprised you haven't seen these vehicles can fly as a formation.

Speaker 6:          01:28:26       Oh my God. This is terrifying.

Speaker 3:          01:28:32       It's gonna sound like Nascar all over the world. We're living in the future. This is really fun. That's awesome. This is really nuts.

Speaker 6:          01:28:41       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:28:46       This is a method to transition between formations in three d

Speaker 3:          01:28:54       folks. You have to see this because what you will, what you're not seeing is these guys are moving in perfect geometrical. They move in these formations and they're showing it from overhead and it's. It's amazing. Their precision is incredible. This is terrifying. By the way. This is only like version one. You know, this is like the first iphone gets smaller and smaller. This is incredible. I wonder how long they can stay in the air for. Oh my God, look at that. They're moving in a figure eight, a perfect figure. Eight. Oh my God. This is spectacular. This is really scary

Speaker 4:          01:29:29       stuff. Scary Shit, man. Now look at them building. Look up quadra copter building a structure. Build Shit, man. They can actually pick shit up and start gluing it built. They can actually build structures. That's amazing. That's what Kurzweil was talking about, man, because when those things shrink down enough so that they can like imagine like just a pile of fucking legos and a shitload of those fucking things and they could actually form matter. That's where it gets really cool. Think about that forming matter. That's where it gets weird when you've got a computer directing swarms of those things to construct architecture that humans couldn't even make, you know, like weird fucking geometries. That can only happen when a computers and control the building process. If it ever gets to that point, it might be the just start fucking killing people. Well, that's funny thing man. People always say that about computers where they're like, they're just going to kill us, but I guess it's. I don't think it's going to be the computers. It would be the things controlling them. Like people automatically assume when the machine inevitably wakes up, it's, it's gonna want to get, I want to kill us, but

Speaker 3:          01:30:34       plague, you know, if it looked at the environment it's living in and realize that there's massive overpopulating entity that's spilling all. It's bullshit into the sea and eating all the fucking animals that live in it and then they will just calculate how long can this last? Well, it can't at this rate, so they'll just start eating the country now. Man. Fucking work. It'd be great. Maybe we would eliminate. No, I don't even. I don't people out of the sky just conscious gets sucked out of the sky. I get they're watching and watching everything. That's a little bit that machines are watching everything and when you litter and when you're a shithead and when you beat, your wife just gets sucked out of. Guy Won't get down voted. Yeah. You get a certain number of negatives.

Speaker 4:          01:31:12       Downvotes like on Reddit, if you get as a person has certain number they carry you in this phase, rub points. If you get blocked by a certain amount of people, just them building this thing. Oh my God, crazy fucking thing. Well, this, the thing that they're building is this enormous like lego building that's really cool looking. That was blocks have glue on them or something, and by the way, this is just the beginning of that shit that's going to be. That didn't exist 20 years ago. There was no no hope of that. Twenty years ago, 20 years from now. What do check this out? If you ever seen, if you've ever seen the video of that, there a machine that you can take to the desert that someone made. It's solar powered because there's so much energy and it focuses the energy of the sun and the desert to turn sand into blocks. It can burn

Speaker 8:          01:31:59       sanding blocks, so now imagine this combined, those fucking things with solar panels and a thing that can infinitely can use an infinite amount of sand in the desert to make blocks. Those things could fly out in the fucking desert and make infinitely gigantic structures with endless fucking energy. Just the combination of those two technologies at the rudimentary level that they're at now, if we can fucking figure out how to make them solar power. Solar is really interesting. It's like it's kind of hit a wall and a lot of ways. So what are you, what are you doing? I googled a solar power sandbox and it came up with minecraft. Solar power is not really strong enough for a lot of shit right now for most people. Can't like have all their electricity through solar power. You use like a lot of people use. Like I have a friend that uses a combination of solar and wind and he actually developed enough from the.

Speaker 8:          01:32:48       He lives in Oregon. He develops enough from nothing. He actually sells it back to the grid, which I don't know. Strange. How do you do that? I don't understand it. Yeah, I don't get it. How do you do what? Sell Electricity back. They pay him. Yeah. There's a meter on it that regulates it going in. But you could also have it fitted so it regulates how much is going on here. So he adds. So the local power plant or whatever is supplying them power doesn't have to work as hard. That's so fucking weird, man. Crazy. You can turn wind into money. Well, if you ever been. There's certain parts of California where we, uh, we have filmed some fear factors where they have these um, these huge, like they look like a farm of these wind things. These windmills, like a windmill farm and there's a shitload of them just sitting up on a hill and they power the area.

Speaker 8:          01:33:33       I don't mind it. I don't know how much they power, how many structures, how many buildings. But it's enough that the, a lot of shit is getting powered by the wind. It's really a trip. Well, it's really windy out there too, so it's a smart thing to do like even as you come out here towards Pasadena and you head up the 2:10 and when you go through that whole mountain ipass ii area where it's like you lose your cell phone signal, fucking beautiful out there. Windy as fuck. A lot of people have like real wind problems. Even out here, like remember when they had a problem? Really recently the wind knocked down a lot of power cables and Pastina guy because he got fucked by wind. I got trapped here. I couldn't even lead the place. Fuck why wind from the was too bad. I like seriously the street out front here with trees flying down the street, things off, flying off the roofs, like metal things and awnings and stayed in.

Speaker 8:          01:34:24       They couldn't get to. My car was too scary, man. It was a death. It was deadly outside. It was like being in a tornado. Wow. No, it was no, seriously. It was really bad. It. There's nothing like NATO. Next time you go out in his back door over here, look at the billboard. That's billboard wishes ripping apart and it was like a super old billboard was shaking like this and things were just flying off of it. That's really powerful, but it's nothing like a fucking tornado. There's, uh, there's been tornadoes that were hit or hit cities in the middle of the night and literally made the city disappear. Especially towns, small towns in the middle of nowhere. You know, what they say that the heat of cities actually prevents tornadoes since all the structure and the way it's the way it's built and the heat coming off of it apparently doesn't work in cities.

Speaker 8:          01:35:09       Do you believe any of that weather control shit they talk about like, um, what's the name of like that, you know, these Eddie Bravo on here for this conversation. Do you believe in that? Like they've been, they've been trying to like actually can. I know they do it like in China, don't they? Like they've been playing around trying to make it rain and like you can put certain particles into the air that actually makes it rain. Um, well they're doing. It sounds like it's some kind of weird. Yeah, they will for sure have done that. In Abu Dhabi. They did it more than 50 times last year. I think they did it once a week. Last year. They made it ran. Yeah. I don't remember what the exact chemical they use, whether there's something with the gum line, the crowds with a something silver. I don't remember what it is, but um, they, they in the clouds with this shit and it makes a rand.

Speaker 8:          01:35:59       So it's so odd to think about Nicole. It's still Nicholson, I don't know, but it's really fucking odd to think about the fact that they're just starting to learn to control the weather. They're just starting to learn to control the, whether they're just starting to learn to have endless amounts of energy. So if we were to evolve and advance without blowing each other up, we would eventually be. We could eventually be a planet that has full control of its weather patterns. Cloud seeding can actually be done by ground generators, a plane or it can be done by a rocket. Weird. Yeah. Wow. Silver iodide, dry ice solid carbon dioxide. Wow. That Pasadena storm was 80 miles per hour. A ef one tornado 73 miles per hour. So it's pretty close. It's faster than f one. What? It's how fast a f one starts at 73 miles per hour in that Pasadena store ans 80 miles.

Speaker 8:          01:36:59       Oh, I thought you had them reversed. So it's faster than a tornado. It was like an ef one tornado. Really? That doesn't even make sense. Where there's different levels of tornadoes. Oh, so it was like bitch ass tornadoes don't to kill anybody. Well, not really bitch ass that. That's a good tornado, Joe. Yeah. Yeah. It's like the beginning of a hurricane winds. They have. They've even used liquid propane to make it rain expands into a gas has also been used. This can be can ice crystals at higher temperatures than silver iodide. The use of high gross scopic materials such as salt is becoming more popular after promising research citation needed seating in cows requires that they contained super cooled liquid water. That is that liquid water colder than zero degrees Celsius. The introduction of a substance such as silver iodide, which has crystalline structure similar to that of ice, will induce freezing nucleation, dry ice or propane expansion cools the air to such an extent that the ice crystals can nucleate spontaneously from the vapor phase.

Speaker 8:          01:38:05       Wow. This is crazy. Kids in the future, people are terrified. In the fucking future. You might be able to send your name, your personal nanobots swarm out of your house, into the clouds above your house and make a little personal thunder shower happen above your house. Yeah. You probably will be able to. That's how much it probably pulls water from farmers. You know? It's probably like. I mean, yeah. Where does that, what we like when you go to a place like Abu Dhabi, which is in the desert and they're. All of a sudden they're making it rain. Yeah. What are they doing? Where's that water coming from? Somebody else getting fucked over, but you don't know. But anyway. Does that other person deserve that water? Who? Who fucking deserves a lot of the smart manager figures out how to pull it out of the sky or some shithead just camps out next to it and I get lucky with my water is joining mine.

Speaker 8:          01:38:53       I found a spot in the dirt and I claim it. Yeah. No, I think the guy who pulls it out of the sky shit when for sure. Fuck that stupid color. Anyone can make a puddle. Yeah, so there is. There is some cloud seeding. It's real science. Whether or not that shit is happening in Burbank everyday like Eddie Bravo thinks it is. All right. Yeah. That's where it gets tricky now that. Yeah. What do you think it is? I can error planes. That's all it is. It's funny because it's always near an airport. Like I live in Burbank. I see it all the time because I lived by Burbank because dude, you don't even understand that's the government is spraying. You're spraying the sky pilot. I just want to know. The pilots are so there are these pilots who were flying over the city and they're like, let's dump poison for the good of the country.

Speaker 8:          01:39:38       That they think they're creating clouds for us. I don't think they're doing it as much as johnny. They, it's listens every. The insurance companies have to pay money on skin cancer and it's way cheaper. If we have a closet door, we got to cover it up. I don't want some burns to have. I think what I've read and whatever, what's been explained to me by pilots is that under certain conditions there's a certain amount of moisture in the air and it gets turned up in the, the uh, turbines have a jet engine and it comes out looking like clouds and it stays in this guy for a while. Turned up water. Can I tell you what the real fucking conspiracy. I figured it out. Oh my God. It's the conspiracy of all conspiracies. It's your inability to stop your hand from putting shit into your mouth.

Speaker 8:          01:40:22       That's the conspiracy dude. It's the fact that people can't control their fucking hand and are always shoving poison into their mouth and eating shitty things and smoking shitty things and taking bad pictures. This was going to be profound. I feel like that is profound, man. I can remember talking to a guy believed in Kim trails some fucking help, some discipline. Well, that's what I'm saying. I was talking to a guy believed in chem trails and he was smoking a cigarette while he was telling me about the poisons that the government's dumping. Oh yeah. Well Michael Rupert. When Michael Rupert in here, he's sweating like crazy. Talking about conspiracy theorist Alex Jones spoke, man, you're killing yourself. Like maybe there is some kind of like evil external force that's trying to destroy you, but really you're the one shoveling the poison and your fucking in in your pile, you know for sure is going to kill you.

Speaker 8:          01:41:13       You're aiding them by bringing these troops into your body. Saying one day I'm going to fight them off, but not now. By now, I just fucking sick to try to figure it out. I'm a pete. These motherfuckers signed for my fourth cupcake going to drink because let's have. Let's have 17 beers today. Again, I think it comes back to what we were talking about earlier about the native Americans having a much better sense of their connection with the food that they're eating and that for us, that whole hunter gatherer thing is out the window. I go to the vons and I pick up meat and I go to, you know, get up, get myself a nice salad and that's it. I didn't have to pick anything. I don't have to go get my water in bottles because all the water's poison. You can't drink it.

Speaker 8:          01:41:53       People die occasionally. Yeah, totally dude. And it's just so funny though, that so many people writhing in physical discomfort because they're too fat or they don't exercise or they don't eat right. Are upset about a conspiracy that the government is, is involved in, is trying to take, take away their happiness or their freedom or, or, or dumb them down. It's like, no, no, no. You don't exercise. You eat at Mcdonald's, you smoke cigarettes, you're house is fucking filthy. That's the shit you should worry about first. Fix that conspiracy, solve that problem. Like stop that conspiracy from happening and then worry about the fucking chem trails. I've been obsessed lately with this finding bigfoot show, watching the show left and right. And it leaves me to sometimes, you know, stone tweets in the middle of the night mocking them and everybody and myself and I'll fucking stupid and for watching the show.

Speaker 8:          01:42:47       But uh, it is a psychological study and one of psychological studies is who are these people that are believing in bigfoot? Who were these people that are leading these guys? And this is what we saw and we're standing here and it comes out and they never asked these dudes. They never go, okay. What do you think about ghosts? Right? Do you believe in Ufos? What about psychics? Do you, how do you feel about. What do you think is, do you think chem trails are real? Like what do you think happened in area 51? What do you think is in Hungary team get to the bottom of what the Messenger is? Because a lot of times the Messenger who is giving you this really crazy, preposterous, outrageous story. They, they, they lean towards that shit. They want that shit to be real. They might not even be lying, but they might. They might be just seeing shit in the woods just because they're fucking wired for that. They want to see it. They want to believe they want to

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       and they can't be fucking trusted. When they go to these finding big foot, they go to these local town halls and shit. They go, all right, who here has seen a sasquatch? And these motherfuckers raised their hands and I'm like, you are. I'm like, you assholes are missing the whole real show. The whole real show. It's, it can't be done by them because they are the people that the whole real show is a bunch of fucking people that want to believe in big foot so bad. They're out in the woods. That's a squash. That was definitely a squash. The yell out,

Speaker 3:          01:44:25       the yelling out in the fucking woods screaming at the top of their lungs and then they hear something that you're something knock. Someone's knocking the Hiller Annie, who knows what it could be a producer thrown a rock. You know, he's got to squash. That's definitely a squash, squash country. That's a squash. What else do you believe in? Dude? Where do you. What do you. What do you do at night when you go to bed? What? What is going on in your mind? What are you hoping for? Do you believe in aliens? Do you? What do you believe? Do you believe in ghosts? You believe in vampires, vampires, rail. How much other crazy shit and you believe in? I think that it's more logical to believe in aliens and that believe in bigfoot, not necessarily big foot is a. first of all. Jane Goodall was a firm Believer in bigfoot and actually stated that, you know, famous primate expert stated that it must be real, that there's too many sightings of the same animal all over the world and it is very possible that there is enough area that hasn't been discovered or it's too densely wooded that it support a large primary like that.

Speaker 3:          01:45:23       If it was intelligent and knew to hide from people. There's 250 different names for it in North America, in the American Indian language. That's, that's big and because there's not a lot of shit that's not real. If they don't have names for and it's based on a real animal, we're going to get a guy in here that's a fucking expert on it, which means nothing. I'm satisfied. I'm going to ask her for Shit. That's probably not right. This is going to be great because on the loch ness monster you are foreign. You have California. Did you get like a license for that? And I have photoshop. I think it comes with a few. Um, you know, if you look at the stories that have gone back to like, you know, long, long fucking time in history for sure. Some people saw bears, they shit their pants. I as a person and they made up a story for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:46:06       Sometimes people remember things in our own lives. We know this, you know, my, my mom is terrible at remembering things that really happened. I'll tell my mom something, don't do it. And I know it happened. I was there, I remember it for sure it happened, but she will swear. I mean you show her pictures of Angela whole. Well, I don't remember that. No, when we did that, a game show in my head show and I told you, we got people to talk about Ufos. Got them to make up a Ufo story because we pretended to be a news guy that had gotten there too late. Would you mind pretending the use of the Ufo people just started talking, man, just so excited they were going to get on television and when I'm watching this stupid bigfoot show and I'm looking at these people trouncing through the woods, I'm looking at a bunch of people that are lonely.

Speaker 3:          01:46:51       They don't have any real purpose in their life. There's these people that don't have real good friends is one weird guy with his poor fucking kid and this kid was like, my dad might be crazy sitting here talking about we saw bigfoot together. What the fuck did we really see? My Dad's a liar. My Dad's claiming you saw big foot and in the kids sort of along along with it, you can wash them. You look at the insincerity and their words. They had a guy on the other day just gay as fuck. Just beyond gay, just crazy flock of seagulls haircut list everything wandering through the woods, seeing bigfoot. I'm sure you did crazy. You insane asshole. Believe that show exists, man. It sounds hilarious. Like exactly like ghost hunters in that. Although shows feature night vision and nothing.

Speaker 4:          01:47:40       That's all you need. Just a house in night vision. It seems crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:47:44       Yeah. I was having a twitter exchange with this chick the other day and we were going off about how combined the two shows and just make it a porno and that's really what it is. Split two lonely people who have the night vision, unkempt, pubes, fatty, sweaty bodies and night vision loads. Loneliness, dude. They're all pretending to hear thing I saw or heard something come in here real quick and then they fuck like getting a car and the darkness and they just. I think I heard something. I think your fingering me, I think they'll keep the ghosts away or two. I think it'll keep. It goes if you suck my cock. Yeah. Scare them. Scan with your boldness and then they fucking the darkness. They fucking the door and then the guy has to get away with. Then they, you know, after guy comes, he's like, I just fucking hurt something for real.

Speaker 3:          01:48:27       Holy Shit. I'm not kidding now. And he runs out of the room. That's how they get out of it because after you come, you know the girl wants a cuddle. It's like we can't cut over in the fucking in a haunted house. Hired something. Jesus is real and he just runs. She's like, you didn't hear shit. Give it the night vision. She can't see. She stuck in the fucking basement in the corner. This guy like, come on, what? I'll tell you warmer. You're getting towards the door warmer. Give me the night vision. I can't fucking seat foam. She hits the wall. Start screaming no more pussy for him. That's a weird show, Joe. They pretend to hear things. What was that? What was that? How many of those shows are they said, what was that? What was that? What was that? It was you being a crazy asshole alone either in the woods or in a basement. Either looking for bigfoot or a ghost.

Speaker 4:          01:49:13       Fuck all that shit. Think about the fact that the Catholic Church still does exorcisms. Think about that shit, dude. Fucking Catholic priests will. Right now there's probably a priest in somebodies house getting a demon out of somebody's body. Think about that. Fucking big foot fine. Aliens. Fine. There's guys dressed as God. Clowns waving around symbols in front of little kids faces to try to get imaginary demons to go out to them.

Speaker 3:          01:49:37       What's really amazing is way more priests out there. Fucking kids are doing extra stuff way more,

Speaker 4:          01:49:46       way more. That's fucked up statistic.

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       We need to figure out if that's true, man. So there's more priests molesting kids and they are getting the demons out of kids. Well, we were talking about on the podcast with Joey, we're talking about how people who run martial arts schools often, it's very culty and the guy who is at the head is the master and is almost beyond reproach and that a lot of times weird sexual shit happens because of that, because it becomes like a cult. Well, that is exactly what happens in the Catholic church and even like in martial arts schools, like people try to keep things under wraps, like there's always like dark secrets. So this guy fucking the students and the fucking one of his students who was married and the husband finds out about. There's always those kinds of scandals, very cult like and with every real controlling cult, there's an element of sexuality and it's usually creepy. It's not like a peace love, you know, everyone polyamorous and whether sexual or non, you know, everything is just about nonjudgmental affection. No, no, no. Most of is not. Most of it's creepy. It's victim set.

Speaker 4:          01:50:47       Thanks dude. And then think about this, take it back to the story that it comes from, whether it's real or not. The story of the Catholic Church comes from name one guy dressed like a gnome in that story. Name. One guy wearing a big golden flowing cape and holding a funny thing and marching around with fucking that Purple Velvet on and fucking walking around on red carpets and giant golden palaces were. Find that in the New Testament, find anything even remotely, like the rituals outside the law. Uh, the holy communion. Find anything. It's fucking,

Speaker 3:          01:51:21       especially, although the audacious use of, of gold and money and spending. Think about all the different gigantic Roman colosseum there. The other were the sistine chapel or think of any of the things of the construction in Rome. Any of the stuff that's at the Vatican that's like a really elaborate, expensive,

Speaker 4:          01:51:39       Gadi Non Christian Shit. Think of what else could have been done with all that energy, but they're like, you know what? Yet Jesus wanted us to have a beautiful giant Golden Palace where I could sit and fuck fucking fuck kids. Four kids on Red Velvet. Yeah. It's just what he wants. That's this story. And so like, so it's very. Either way,

Speaker 3:          01:52:00       this attitude is really offending a lot of people on twitter. There's a lot of Christians that have sent me texts saying, I wish you would remind me or at least warn us that before you go on these horrible Antichristian rants, don't destroy our culture.

Speaker 4:          01:52:17       Oh No, no, no. See, I'm not talking about Christianity. I'm talking about the cult of loon loon, which is my Christianity. That's not. No, no, no, no, no. Got To be pushing your loon. Loon not to sell t shirts. You Sound Lumina tee shirts and not a bad idea. I am selling posts. There's not a bad idea selling the fucking tee shirts, but no man. It's no my moon brand. It's the fucking church brand. I would never take it from that, but do it. It's, it's, uh, uh, that's not real. That's not what I view as real Christianity because you look at a lot of the Christianity that some people follow. It's based on a lot of the writings of somebody named Paul who, uh, never met Jesus. He was, he was persecuted Christians and he was walking on the road to Damascus. It's not a vision. His name was saul of Tarsus and he saw a vision of Jesus. Jesus appeared in the sky and said, Saul, so why do you persecute me? And at that moment saw was

Speaker 8:          01:53:11       filled with the glory of the Lord.

Speaker 4:          01:53:14       And he was blinded and he wandered and found some Christians, Phantom and his name became Paul. And he was the founder of the modern Christian church and you wrote all these letters about what it is to be a in the spirit of Christ and to be with Christ, but he never met God outside of, in that vision.

Speaker 8:          01:53:30       So essentially he was like Jimmy swaggered, but a long time ago, remember when Swagger, swagger to Pat Robertson, southern 90 foot tall Jesus. I don't know, but he had a vision. This part, the Paul of Tarsus had to add a vision and I don't know, I don't know which one, but yeah, that's where it came from. It wasn't from the original teachings. You know, the original teachings don't. I'm sorry if I'm offending pizza. Really Weird though that. Um, uh Oh, it was oral roberts, oral roberts, 900 foot tall Jesus in 1977, which is when he would have been around. That was one 900 foot tall. Jesus was touring was part of the galaxy, the fucking galaxy coming to oral roberts in the middle of the desert and showing show themself. But it's really interesting to think about that when you realize that it's like, so, so a lot of people call, um, what's after the gospels, the epistles at which a lot of them,

Speaker 4:          01:54:18       holly in theology, it's not Christian Christianity, it's based on because here's the big problem that Christians ran into in many verses in the Bible. Jesus said, before some of you die, I'm going to be back and even come back in, some of the disciples started dying and then it's like, wait a minute, he's not coming back, what are we going to do? And they had to reorganize shit and turn it into something that was like, that made more sense, which is to deal with this, uh, some, some basic problems. And what Christ, if he existed in that story, he said it was going to happen, you know? And now we've got the bank robbers syndrome, you know that, right? It's the bank robber thing. What, when somebody robs a bank, they say everybody get on the fucking ground and don't move. I'm going to walk out of here and I'm going to come back in two minutes.

Speaker 4:          01:55:04       And if any of you have moved, I'm going to blow your fucking brains out. This is what a bank robber does when he's robbing a bank. This is what Jesus did when he said, I'm going to be back really soon, and if anyone's misbehaving, you're going to hell forever. And that's been going on for a long fucking time, man, and it's probably going to keep going on and on and on, and each it. Each time it advances down a generation, it gets weirder and weirder and weirder. So now we've got a guy dressed like a fucking gnome feeling. Totally cool, sitting in a golden throne when there's people all over the planet starving. And somehow that guy is a disciple of a person who went around saying, love your neighbor as yourself and love the Lord your God with all heart, mind, and soul.

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       By the way, clear evidence that he harbored child molesters. Clear evidence that he derailed investigations and move people around when he was whatever the fuck he was a bishop or whatever the fuck he was when he was doing this. He was in Phoenix. Yeah. Ratzinger. You can't. I mean, imagine the bitch. Have you ever seen the pictures of him with the male gymnast? The acrobatics that. I honestly still think that that was the. I didn't because my brain seems fake. It's fake right now. It's totally real. They the pope. How did all that? How does Catholicism become the leading source of power worldwide of Christianity? Because there's red, there's all the other forms of Christianity. They seem to be much more scattered. Like there's not like one heavy duty dude. The head of it, like Catholicism, you know, we were. Who's the main guy and Episcopalian?

Speaker 2:          01:56:34       Who's the main guy in the baptist? There's no one. There's no main guy like the Catholic pope that's like there's a. there's a hierarchy in the episcopal church, but nothing like the. You know what I'm saying? Worldwide recognized the pope is the top dog. How did that get to be the strongest, most powerful form of Christianity, which is, by the way, also the most nuts, the most fucking crazy judgmental, the most guilt ridden in injecting horrible feelings of sorrow into little boys' heads because they touch their penis. Is there, Joe? Is there a, is there a statistic on the what percentage of priests and the last kids is 89 percent, but we must know a certain number of them. I don't think it comes up all the time. I don't think they can. I don't think they know. But is there a number of priests that have gone, gotten incarcerated for molesting kids?

Speaker 2:          01:57:22       What's that number? How many is it? Seven 97. 90 seven percent. Don't listen to him. Listen, I know you're talking to 20 percent of the allegations. The priests was deceased. Uh, let's see. I'm just curious if they're sending the campaign, what percentage of priest abuse. Okay, let's see here. Don't know ma'am. Well, there is certainly a certain number of priests who had been charged. I mean, I know that that story has come up, so there's gotta be some number. I'm just wondering how many. Whoa, what? Oh, okay. It's only for their concluding there. I thought it's at 40 percent. Holy Shit. I my brain blip for a second and concluded that for about four percent of the US priests since 1950, I've been accused of sexual abuse of children. Okay. However, here's the caveats. There are probably many victims who remain silent and not yet come forward to accuse their abusers.

Speaker 2:          01:58:17       There are probably some adults who have come forward to accused priests who have false recovered memories of abuse that never happened, so it could be both ways. Imagine maybe some adults who knowingly falsely accused innocent priests who abuse they do to imagine this. Imagine if four percent of people who work at apple stores had been accused of molesting kids. Yeah. I used that onstage before. You said that Nascar driver, so saying a massive organization of Nascar drivers running around in circles with their cars and then fucking kids, you know, we, we, we'd say we don't need Nascar. This is ridiculous. Yeah. That four percent of apple employees, probably molests kids because they're the computer nerds. They, you know, they don't get paid. That's not even funny. I mean, no, I'm being serious there. When you say like, no, four percent of apple employees don't fuck kids do.

Speaker 2:          01:59:02       It's a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of people in the whole world who were child molesters. It's really small. The problem is when, when it happens, it's fucking devastating. So if it's one in a community of a million people, that's a lot. 1,000. It's a lot. Have you looked at the APP that shows you who are near? There's like 300 in Burbank. Yeah. Well, how many millions of people live in Burbank? You know, how many people you think live in Burbank? Let's say population of Burbank. I'm going to go 500,000 deal with every series. This is something I've been trying to figure out for years. I can't wait to hear the answer. What is the population at Burbank, California? One hundred and 3000. Three hundred 40. To answer your question. Yeah. Yeah. I got your bench. One hundred. Three thousand. Three hundred 40 in 2010. So out of that, how many, how many pedals are in Burbank?

Speaker 6:          02:00:03       MMM.

Speaker 2:          02:00:04       Isn't that a song? Should be some hipsters on some ironic, ironic hipster song about beddoes. Yeah, I'd probably say I would probably say it 100. There's A. There's a an uncomfortable number of people that have fuck kids. That's an question. Yeah. It's all pretty disgusting and terrifying. Really. That's one of the first things that we should eradicate because if that's something that flux kid up for the rest of her life and then if they lash out and start doing on new kids, then they become. We talked about this, that it's like a vampire. It's real vampires like you actually do infect someone and make them what you are. A monster transmits itself and it's been transmitted for a fucking long time, man. It's been being transmitted for generations. It's such a gross thing. It's such a broken thing and it has roots in primate behavior.

Speaker 2:          02:00:53       That's what's really fucked up about it. Sexuality is so strange and in our world it's so. It's so unnatural because we're actually covering our bodies up. We hide our genitals. You know, we have this weird sort of a common atory lifestyle of natural animal urges mixed with his higher self and consciousness in language and the awareness of the impact of your words and deeds and physical acts on other people and that you're putting out a negative energy in a negative vibe. And we encourage that in our communities and discourage that in our, in our laws. But the reality is we have these fucking, these urges to fuck and they're not regulated. They're not like, no one's like recognizing that like, hey, you know, we need to like why is, is prostitution bad?

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       If someone explained that to me, if someone needs money and someone has a mouth, you know, and they go, you know what, I can make a lot of money with this mouth and what is worse? Working at Wendy's for a week and making $300 or sucking a guy's Dick for 10 minutes and making $500. And a lot of people will go, I would rather suck this guy's Dick and this guy, he's some poor guy who's Horny, you know, and it's like you give him a mouth massage on his dick and he blows a load in your mouth and he's so happy. Oh my God, he's so released like, that was so good. And he gives you $100 tip. Now you made 600 bucks. Why is that bad? I don't. I'm not sure. Why is it okay to do that for free? How come if she meets that guy and she likes him, she blows them and it's the greatest thing that ever happened, then that's fine. But if she meets that guy and you know, he's like, listen, I have 500 bucks and I would like to get my dick sucked and I know your hard earned money and we want to make a deal. Why is that bad? Wow.

Speaker 5:          02:02:35       I, yeah, it's a, it's a what do you want one? I just found a website that tells you how many sex offenders are in each city and Los Angeles. And it's pretty shocking at the highest numbered one. No. Right. So Burbank has 1,875 sex offenders. That's more than one percent. Yeah. Beverly Hills, wasn't it? Yeah. Beverly Hills is the highest railing with 4,903. Which is weird because Beverly Hills, there's more people that live in Burbank and then beverly hills. Right. That's a good question. Um, so, so is it because money. Yeah. So money equals, that's kind of weird. Pasadena here we got a really hills pedophiles. One thousand, 306 here. Because I mean there's like Beverly Hills, the houses are spread apart. There's not as many people crammed in. Yeah. There's only 34,000 people live in Beverly Hills and they have 4,903. You guys, we have figured out to crazy fucking things in this podcast.

Speaker 5:          02:03:30       Number one, Coca Cola is making the majority of cocaine in the world. And number two, beverly hills is filled with. Holy Shit. Wow. That's groundbreaking shit, man. That's crazy. We need to spark up and think about those two heavy. Oh, we might have people coming here for the next show. Whatever. Would those targets? Did you want to eat? I'm not supposed to anymore. I apologize. We can't say it anymore, man, that word, but it's my friends. Every now and then I'll slip one out and plus they're already. Sounds great. You know what actually got me saying it a couple times just to. My friends got damn stand hopes. New CD. Really funny by the way, before himself it's called. It's really good. It's, I think it stan host best work, but he says Fagen and a couple of times with my God I missed that word for word. It's just the problem is it's associated as a gay slur and even though I have a lot of like pro gay stuff in my act especially now have a lot of still. You can't say it. You can't say right now, man, I ain't never liked this great word. I like call me animals didn't like it because you get called out a few too many times.

Speaker 8:          02:04:39       I set you up for that one. That's now I just fucking such a shitty. It's like always coming out of the mouth of fucking dope fucking rednecks and the backs of school buses and just dip shits playing. Fucking true xbox. They ruined it. The flux. Yeah, they ruined it. I could have had some years. Yeah. My 40th birthday cake, jody is Ari Shapiro got me a fucking birthday cake and said happy birthday, and it was beautiful. Beautiful. You know what it seems like back then it was okay to say that was only like four years ago when I put my special out. It changed while I was doing and come in and out. They had a real problem using the word faggot. Why? Remember when we were just in Texas saying retard like that was shocking that you can't really use retard either right now. That's. That was weird.

Speaker 8:          02:05:28       I retard became a problem in Austin, in the vaults. Austin. We're in Austin. I said, you gotta stop with the retard. It became a problem. Yeah. Political correctness is fucking completely ridiculous. Supporting his intent. Her trainees, the new word tranny tranny's shut up. You can't say tranny and people were telling me that today that trainees the new. I don't believe that. Oh, I wouldn't know. It can never take away our trend. No. You know what? I believe it because I've seen someone say in, in someone accusing someone of being a homophobe. They said something about them upsetting the lesbian. Gay. It was like l, G, b, t, q. I go by, I go queue. I go, wait a minute. I go lesbian, lesbian, gay, transsexual, transvestite Que [inaudible] Q. which ones that? Queer? Queer. Queer is a totally obscure one. They don't want to define it like they might like guys.

Speaker 8:          02:06:30       They might like girls. They might be by. They might be weird. They're queer. Whatever the fuck they are. What is that? How can you. Is that the most ambiguous definition ever? Have a sexuality as queer, queer south, but that's when people are going real deep. Well, it's because they want people to be able to define themselves and I agree with that man. Of course, whatever you want, but when you're getting mad at people saying gay slurs used, you know the term queer. Well, yeah, no, you're right man. It's all fucking intention to like what's behind there. If there's anger behind it, it's an ugly word. It's why a black people can call you niggers. Hey, is what it is. You know, you know when you hear two bucks site sitting around shooting the shit with Dr Dre and they're being funny with each other. Yeah. It's not offensive. Some old man is yelling at a young kid because he's walking on his lawn. Then it becomes offensive and dehumanizing. I meant obviously I met a beautiful black girl the other day about trying. It was sop. It's on my list, but I,

Speaker 2:          02:07:35       I. It was my friend's sister, but she was just so beautiful to get in shape for that first. Now you always start off with at your worst, start off with your worst presentation and if they accept you at that, really you don't ever try to impress a girl. Never. That's bullshit. When you got dumped the first time, dude, you lost like 70 pounds. That's when you really realize how to get back in the game. That was because I was out of, it was a seven year relationship. That was internet fame, Sun. That's what it was. That the Internet fame. You weren't the producer of a very famous podcast. Brian, how many penthouse pat have you dated? Seven. Seven. That's normal dude. The guy was like, you'll usually get a lot of penthouse, but seriously, how many? Uh, too. I finally did it to girls in the industry ever clean industry.

Speaker 2:          02:08:23       Well, you know, since I've been at Hollywood a bit on the industry part of the industry, really, uh, I do a lot of industry things. I've been history newsletter that I subscribed to day. What's happening with that condom thing? Man? Is it fucking up the industry? Seems to be a lot of talk that they're going to move to Arizona or something like that or vegas that it's going to move to Vegas, which is a lot of, well not really because I think a lot of girls live in vegas anyway because a lot of them they make money dancing as well as doing movies. You know, they can, if they like announced like the thing they announced, they do feature dancing and people like dudes are fucking fans. Have some porn stars. Me made states may say it's kind of weird and strange, but why is it.

Speaker 2:          02:09:08       I mean, look, if you're a fan of an actress, you know, you come to see her at a book signing, you know, you're, you're a fan of the way of sucks dicks and she's nice enough to let you watch her suck a lot of Dick's beautiful women and then you pretend that it's your and, and you blast all over yourself. Dude. You know what's wrong with that? Beautiful women is beautiful. Like the Pamela Anderson right there. I think she is gorgeous. You know that. I think that is A. I think she is beautiful in that. Yeah, that's like art. So there's a certain art in what she looks like her body. It's so. It's so sexually arousing. You know, you look at her perfectly manicured toes and her toe ring and Oh, you just want to lick her button. That's right there. Right word. You're obsessed with that button.

Speaker 2:          02:09:49       Yeah, it's placed perfectly. I want to dumb luck. Look, see the. They'd line up on the other side of her shirt. I think it's just the way it is. It's just a hot picture. The pictures, by the way, I didn't create this right here. You know, it's unfortunate though, man. What's unfortunate is that women like that man, especially if they're not like heavy duty into working out instead of get older and they lose their body, they become creepy. Look, we tried to kill her ass. They asked disappears. That's when it gets really weird when you see like older women their asses like sink and turn under, you know, and old men to like. They get that Larry King Body where the. There's no muscle tone going on and when a woman becomes. When a woman goes from Pamela Anderson

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       and she's still attractive, she hasn't hit this yet, but it's coming, you know, unless she figures out some way to do a lot of fucking squats and keep her body. Like when you become a woman who has enormous artificial boobs and your body's kind of falling apart and you have these big bags sitting in front pushing out your shirt and you know this cleavage that you're, but it's been sun drenched for so long, it's got this weird sort of leathery texture, new trying to tone that down with heavy doses of moisturizer so your tits are always greasy and leathery at the same time and your is of habit rating. So he tried to stick it out a little. So you're wearing high heel shoes where it's really not appropriate and they're really high and you know, you're, you're awkward, you can barely walk and you really, your, your, your ass has gone.

Speaker 3:          02:11:20       You become a monster. You become a stranger on the news. There's going to be like this wave of suicides from people as well. That's a weird thing, man. It's a weird look, you know? Well, yeah, it's weird. It's, that's getting attached to your physical, to your physical body and using that as your main tool. Sure. I think dangerous proposition, man. I think I'm you. That's a really easy to say though, when you're a girl and you look like Pamela Anderson. Dude, first of all, when she was young, she was so hot. That's all anyone eat. Probably comment all the time. Time when she was young, all the people that she met, I guarantee you everyone was just, holy shit. You're so pretty. Yeah. But that happens. But it wasn't what, uh, when a girl gets addicted and gets caught up in that, it's almost like there's nothing that can match the kind of power and energy she gets just from her own looks.

Speaker 3:          02:12:13       So she's almost, it's almost like, it's just, it was too alluring to just run with that too many people were encouraging her, you know, and essentially she got away with without doing any porn except for that one accidental time. Yeah, man. Have a good one too though. Yeah, she did like some playboys and stuff, you know, where you got to see her naked and that was satisfying enough. But I mean she made a living. She was so hot. She made a living off being hot and that's what she did. What sad is when people. It does, I mean it's not her fault that she was super fucking hot. It's incredible, but the sad thing is if she was attached to that perception of herself, it's a. we're just assuming. We're just assuming now that she's maybe she's super cool. She sat her down and had a conversation whether you would really enjoy it.

Speaker 3:          02:12:56       I don't know her. She's all. I'm. All I'm saying is positive. All I'm saying is that she was so ridiculously hot when she was young that I think almost anybody would have been corrupted by that kind of beauty and not that she even was, but I mean I don't. I don't know how you could not be a professional hot chick if you were that pretty. Look at her dude. Look at her. That's from whatever that is. That's her prime. Just like one of the hottest chicks that's ever walked the face of the earth. I pulled back. I think that's actually a reasonable back into see your whole body. Do you see your whole body? They're run, so you get that whole thing there, man. It's a recent poster. Well then she still came to it together. Good for her. That chick is hot as fuck.

Speaker 3:          02:13:33       Great. That's incredibly hot, right? Well, I think when you're that pretty. I think you know you have. We all have to be reasonable. That girl got some crazy lottery ticket and she decided to cash it in. She, she ran. She ran the dyson. She came up double seven in the looks department. I don't fault chicks for doing that. I don't either. Man. That's. I wasn't saying that at all. Some people do, right? Some people like immediately they will discount somebody if they are a a, a professional hot check or if they're a girl who's attractive like immediately because they know it's so easy to be that person. Life is so easy. What are the odds of you have been thinking? What are the. What are the odds that you've been contemplating your existence? Why would you? Life is so easy. Everyone is just tripping over themselves to try to give you things, but I've met plenty of them that do and those girls are insane for sure.

Speaker 3:          02:14:23       It's amazing when you run into someone who's in his beautiful and intelligent with great personality, great sense of humor. It's amazing. It's like, wow, you're looking at you here because to get to that point, you had to have some humility that didn't come from looking in the mirror. The reaction that you're getting from the people around you. That could be that. Some of them, it's just simply that they, you know, they got into yoga or that got into some sort of meditation discipline and they sort of formed. I mean, it could have been the way they were raised. They just sort of formed a, a human personality instead of a hot chick personality. That's the best. It must be hard though, man. Being a hot check must be like the easiest way to get by in life, skate through a bunch of, stumbling over that.

Speaker 3:          02:15:05       Also though, if there's a lot of sadness to that life for some. Sure. Yeah. Well, there's also when, when, when someone feels like they're getting scammed over, like you don't really like, um, you know, if, if, if someone's in a situation where a girl is using her, looks to get by in life, the guy who is taking advantage of that, the guys who get with those girls, they know, they know that this isn't a real, this isn't a real love, this is a real love under certain conditions and that certain conditions are you're here to provide like finances or pay for things or something. There's something that those guys are going to present that. So that manipulative relationship is never the real relationship where you really both truly love each other and you can't wait to see that person. It's always this weird, creepy deal where you know you're getting fucked and you want to check her cell phone because you don't like to wear a [inaudible] trainer looks at you when you say hi to her at the gym.

Speaker 3:          02:15:59       He thinks she might be fucking are trained. Man. It was crazy. And so imagine if you were like some old dude, you're like 80 years old and you get yourself a 30 year old chippy and she likes to work out, you know, and you, you're playing golf. And she walked in and she's like getting stretched out by this fucking 25 year old trainer. She's got her leg on his shoulders. A lot of dudes who do creepy shit like that. All right, time to stretch out. So we're going to do here. I want to pick your leg up. You gotta put it on my shoulder. Hey fuck head. You don't have to do that stupid are you? You could stretch all those major muscle groups on the ground. You'd dump. Fuck. But there's a lot of dudes who like do creepy shit with girls. All right, well it really lean both your arms back and they'd get a nice firm sexual grip on their forearms.

Speaker 3:          02:16:38       So just to let a woman feel the grip strength, you know what I'm talking about? And they just pull you back, pull you back at some weird, uncomfortable sort of semi sexual positions. Some sorta overinflated doggy style position. You know, and then you let them go and then you're stretching out their arms and you know, you're showing your own discipline, you stretch out with them and then it's poor fucking guy's 80 years old wasn't going to do it. He just has to be happy, I guess. Yeah, he should be happy. He's just let everybody fuck her and hope. Hope nobody poisons them. Yeah, that's an inevitability. But that's the problem is they're all gonna. They're all going to poison you, man. How many 80 year old guys who you think are dating third 30 year? Twenty year olds right now? That's a really good question. Uh, let's think.

Speaker 3:          02:17:23       Let's, I wonder if we could find that statistic online. That's something you would. Who knows man up in the hamptons and like monsters. But I really love him. I just think he's wonderful because when people enter those relationships, they don't enter them. They just don't even care about his lungs. He's body is an amazing person. His energy is so loving and you know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't want to leave his side. It sounds amazing. See, I hope to grow 81 day the girls got diamonds on shit and she's just lying around, murdered the animal skins and driving around in a Bentley feels like it's not even connected to the road. I feel like you're floating on a carpet through the air. She knows he's probably only got two more years of life and then she gets millions of dollars because he was in love with her. I wonder how many of those there are out there a lot.

Speaker 3:          02:18:16       There's a lot and you know, you could say, well, if you want it to be cynical and pragmatic that you know he's providing something. She's getting something out of this. It's a good relationship. He wants comfort and sex and she's willing to sort of give that as long as he provides a ridiculous income to her. That's the reason why they have this unbalanced relationship in the first place. He has to be unbalanced financially to overcompensate for the physical, unbalanced. He has to be ridiculous on balance. He asked to be buying or minks and diamonds and then you get to stick your Dick in my mouth. I like diamonds and that's, that's the deal. She has them so they could say, oh, he was using her or she was using him for his money. Of course. That's the deal. Yes. Using him for his money and he's using her for her great hot body. You're not supposed to get this when you're 80. It's essentially what you're doing is taking on an insane prostitution contract that you almost like, like almost nobody could keep up with. That's the only way you can keep a hot chick if you're 80. I mean, it's just incredible to think of that. Eighty year olds can get that horny man if they take Viagra. And I think also if, um, it's a lot of them, it's a psychological thing. You know, there's

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       a lot of 80 year old guys that can't believe that they can get a 20 year old hooker. They probably can't even believe it. And when they're alone with this, if they can get it up still, oh my God, how good must've feel to bang some really hard 20 year old Russian hooker. It's kind of fucked up because he's only 20. Let's make her 23. Let's make it 23. Really hot. Twenty three year old Russian hooker who's really good at it. She's really good at it. I would just have to like you just. It's the fact that underneath this beautiful young thing is a withered Chris that's about to go feed the worms. It's like it would be tough for me to beat that out of my mind as I stared at her, at her, at her hot body. I would still be like, man, you're fucking.

Speaker 2:          02:20:10       You're wrinkling and you can barely breathe and your knees or to so good. God damn this feel so good. You can come in her mouth. You can come in around whatever you want. She doesn't care. What do you want to come? Whether you want to come. She said he's. He's healthy. Oh Man. More power to him, but he should give up his whole empire. He's not gonna live very long anyway. Just keep it all up. Yeah, I think it's. I mean, I think that situation, there certainly is something for. Dude, that's priceless. That's worth a lot of goddamn money. Yeah. A girl, a really hot check to just fuck you whenever you want and you're an 80 year old man. You better be paying that bitch. That's a ridiculous thing to ask. You think it's tough to ask them to be a garbage man. How about asking a fucking old guy whenever he wants?

Speaker 2:          02:20:58       You think there's any like 80 year old. Do you think there's any 80 year old guys living in studio apartments that have 30 year old girlfriends? No. No, there's none of that doesn't exist. Maybe there might be a few broken chicks out there that you got roped into some bad poetry or something like that. It's possible. Most guys though, roped in the back. Some guy pretends to be good. You've been lost girl and you know he's a information he has no. He takes time with her and something no one ever did and he has needs and she takes care of it for them. That's possible most of the time. Not Likely. Most of the time it's a motherfucker that's living in some shit that nobody should be living in some crazy fucking castle. There's some. I, I, every now and then as a goof, I like to go on a website and look at like stupid expensive houses that are for sale.

Speaker 2:          02:21:50       Like what is the most expensive house you could buy, like $20, million dollar houses and you can go and look at the pictures of them. They show them online and you see the grounds and everything like holy shit, like what is this crazy way that one person gets to live? This is nuts. I looked at this one house, it was a compound. It was absolutely insane. It was 600 plus acres and this incredible fucking house. And I mean it was one of the most extravagant things that a person could ever purchase an urn and own in their life. They essentially own a kingdom was really like a 650 acre

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       kingdom. And uh, you know, no, it was a little chippy. She's 26, she just came here from Czechoslovakia and uh, you know, we started hanging out man and she likes to smoke weed. I still smoke a little weed every now and then. Next thing you know, she's talking to my deck and I don't know what to do. I'm a mom. I'm 86 years old. I mean, what kind of relationship we're going to have. I mean, what do you think? Should I pursue this? I have a walker, a walker. I have a lot of 86 year olds. Have a lot of them. If I want to get down the steps, I've got a ride. And what would you tell an old man who, if there was a hunch, I would say you might want some people to fucking keep an eye on her, you know, but then you gotta make sure that you have only gay security guards because uh, that dirty bitch will suck their dicks.

Speaker 3:          02:23:13       I mean, she's really hot. Well no, but I'm saying if you're a guy and you were like the super rich dude who lives in this giant crazy house and you're 80 years old and this is 23 year old, really hot eastern bloc chick that may or may not be an assassin as well. A hooker and a you gotta have some gay security guards that are keeping an eye on her. You can't have like young stud guys because she'll just suck their dicks, you know, that dirty bitch. They most guys will not be able to stop themselves, you know, a really, really fat from Iowa and never met a girl like that before and all of a sudden she's like, listen, relax baby, relax. And she's rubbing your balls. Like, Holy Shit, I can't believe there's going to have a look. I get fired for this. Relax baby with that and we'll work something out and you know, she's, you know, I can fuck this old man all the time. You know, sometimes I want to go out and have fund and we have a deal. Yeah. Next thing you know, there are plotting his death. That's what it is. That's how it goes. Dunkin. And that's when he's got to be careful for. He's only have gay security guards should have big bad ass gay dudes that watch over you. That's like, that's the weirdest end of your life. And find the girl. Yeah, you got a big.

Speaker 3:          02:24:28       And at 30 year old Russian prostitute, you gotta Gut go get those guys to take her everywhere. They never let any guys come near her because she's mine and you don't let that bitch fucking poison me. Just absurd. It's just absurd, man. It's a lot of guys lives, right? Yeah. Its absurdity. It's so funny the way that you could end up when you're blinking out of the universe, like you can actually blink out of the universe and a silk robe next to a 30 year old Russian stripper. I know a man who was a um, uh, he was a successful man, but he was very, very weak. He was like very physically weak and he was much older than her. He was about 30 years older than her, you know, he was maybe. Yeah, she was like in her probably in her forties and he was in his seventies and there was the anger from her at him and the way she would yell at him

Speaker 8:          02:25:24       and treat him this, this complete total lack of respect because, you know, basically they're the. They had been married for a long time. The only reason why they got married in the first place is because he was rich and she was hot and she learned along the way. This motherfucker's not going to do nothing, and the way to get them off you is to just yell at them and humiliate them in front of other people. Will you fucking stop? Just stop. She was this Russian lady, Judy. She yelled at him in front of me and my friends and it was this really fucking super uncomfortable moment, man. Just snapped at him in front of everybody and we're like, we had a peak at this guy's life. What, what, what, what did he, what did he done? It was so bad. Do you remember? I don't know.

Speaker 8:          02:26:02       Nothing. Nothing. At the time. He was a really nice guy. He was a doctor and uh, he made, made them a lot of money. Man. He was rich. He had a crazy house and crazy cars and shit and she was like a really hot Soviet bloc looking chick. I don't remember what, what part of what part of the Soviet Union or Russia or whatever she was from. But it was something like that. I don't remember Ukraine. She might've. No, I don't remember. I don't remember fucking tragic dude. It's so tragic and it's tragic when someone's with someone and that person doesn't want to be with your man or give away, you know, love and like these little like rations, you know, they give a sex and affection and little rations, you know? Well No, it's like that thing they experiment. They did with the monkey, you know, but it's like one of the worst experiments of all time.

Speaker 8:          02:26:46       They take a fucking wire monkey and there's those pictures of the monkeys leaning to the wire monkey in pretending it's a real monkey on it. They put carpet on it and they, they had this poor monkey that thought it was a mama. There was nothing else in there for it. But some people are in relationships where there that little fucking monkey and they're clinging onto nothing. There's nothing there and they're just pretending that there's love. There's something there for them. And they know in their heart there's nothing there and they just keep fucking doing it because they're terrified to let go of that fucking thing and go out into the world. It's super hard to find someone that's really cool to hang out with. That doesn't just become a shithead. Eventually someone just someone who doesn't fall apart after you get to know them for awhile.

Speaker 8:          02:27:30       Because that happens with a lot of people. Man, a lot of people do really good in the beginning of a relationship because they can pretend to be someone really cool. Yeah. Right. And then as time goes on you realize like, oh, he's tired and she's a bitch, man. Why you negative to, you know, you're always negative. Stop it. Yeah. It's really weird. That thing when you stop acting and you ended up meeting the real person. And that can either be. Hopefully that moment should be wonderful. Like when the fucking guard comes down and you really see the person, there should be some beautiful thing, but sometimes it's not. Sometimes. Or sometimes one mask comes off and there's just another one there, but it's, it's like all of us are wandering around right now in that state that we're putting on his show, pretending to be as they're pretending to be hoping to try to fake it till you make it. There's some of that going on to you. I've said

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       often on this show that my best advice to someone else. Pretend to be the guy or be the guy rather that you pretend to be when you're trying to get laid. Just be that guy. Be that guy, be that, ah, that guy. When you're trying to impress a chick with how cool you are, be that guy for real CFA person know become the. Hold yourself to a higher standard. Hold yourself to a standard. That's admirable. A lot of people just act on instinct and they don't ever look at their life from like a point of view, like, what would I be impressed with if someone handled this? Isn't it? What would be the most moral and the coolest, nicest thing to do here? The most admirable thing to do and when, when you become capable of doing that, you become capable of, of looking at your whole life through the, like almost an objective perspective.

Speaker 4:          02:29:08       Do you, have you ever heard of something called transactional analysis or game theory? Have you ever heard of this sort of game theory? I didn't know it was transactional analysis ideas. It's like, so yeah, it's an analysis of the transactions that happen between people. So what they. Right

Speaker 3:          02:29:24       something to do with the guy from the, uh, a brilliant mind. I don't know, isn't it that the Nobel prize I think was on. I'm sorry,

Speaker 4:          02:29:33       I, I'm reading a book called the Games people play and it's like an analysis of like the basic games that we play, for example, like shaking hands is a game where the rules of the game or you're kind of like transmitting a what I think what they call a token. So like if I come up to you and I extend my hand for you to shake my hand and you don't shake my hand, then that creates a weird moment because you haven't made it a complete transaction. You know what I'm saying? Yes, yes. So it's like it's an analysis of everything at that level and it just sort of comes back that we're all engaged in these weird games. Everyone, you know, whether you're acting like you're the greatest person on a date or whether you're acting like you're some kind of weak person who is always broke and it's always in bad relationships or whether you're acting like you're a priest or whether you're acting like you're whatever the fucking thing is.

Speaker 4:          02:30:24       You're just playing a game. You're just playing the game of being this person, you know, that's. So we're all in the kind of endless, absurd situation of having to pretend to be something, you know, whatever it is like fucking waiters, like would it or what anyone you're buying anything from there having to act in this weird way called professional, but they're just acting like who is this character? It's a character. You're playing a weird character of someone who's like, thank you. Yes. May I get you another drink like tv host or a strip club dj? Yeah. Or, or just almost anyone. It's just, it's just the things that people think are themselves. This is who I am. I love the rolling stones and I really enjoy fishing. It's like, is that really you? That's who you are. That's your identity. Because if you like get far enough back, you'll realize that that's not you. That's just a game that you're playing and you can keep going back and back and back until you emerge and everything, but we.

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       Nobody wants to do that. Everybody wants to stay as the fucking thing. No one wants to. Everyone wants a little, certainly comfort in predetermined patterns. You know, the people love to say, listen man, I'm a Republican. I vote. I'm a Christian, so I'm voting for George W. he's my guy. You know, people love to be part of teams. Do that. It's fun to play. It's very difficult to back up the way you're saying. I mean, it's like to do it without help. To do it without either psychedelic help but to do it without some sort of intense meditation and Yoga and training and that's like a huge. It's a really difficult. It's a difficult task, but it's the. It's, it's like if you begin to engage in people are going to get better at that. Hell yes, for sure. Definitely. People are going to get better because the information is getting out there.

Speaker 2:          02:32:05       There's so many information systems out there that back in the pool of thousands of years ago, you couldn't have books. There weren't even books. Man, I was very difficult to get a book. Books were incredibly valuable. Now this shit is scattered throughout the entire fucking planet. You have instantaneous access to this stuff. It's fucking. Yeah. I think people are going to learn profit. Brendan Walsh just walked in, which a ends ends his podcast. We're going to start a new one right after this. We're going to start the dusk squad. Icehouse chronicles, because the comics are starting to pilot for the show. It is already 9:30. Yeah, it was John Nash, the guy from them, when we have brilliant mind, he did win a some sort of a Nobel prize on a game theory, so I dunno some along those lines. He went crazy. He was a guy that went nutty. I didn't know he went crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:32:53       That's the movie about what it was the WHO's the guy who's the guy who played a beautiful mind? Gladiator. Russell Crowe. Yeah. Brilliant performance, and he played that guy and he went nutty, like imagined a bunch of shit and shit to us and man, you should check it out. You love it. It's really brought himself back. It's a really. He's a fascinating story. He actually brought himself back to reality, started ignoring the voice. He still hears voices in the head, his head, but he just ignores him now. He concentrated. He can differentiate between what's real and what's not and so he stayed saying, even in the midst of twirling and Santa, he managed to figure out how to like how to maintain it. That's cool. Yeah. That's when everything really fast time figuring out how to maintain that. She's a really fascinating case. Really Interesting Guy, a brilliant, brilliant guy.

Speaker 2:          02:33:36       Who's who, who, who went mad and brought himself back really nuts. Um, that's it. Those are 200 podcasts, ladies, gentlemen, all you freaks people out there at the gym. All you people out there driving cross country and sitting on trains and doing whatever the fuck you're doing. A porch swing where we're, we're so happy that you tuned into the show. We'd love doing it. We're happy. You guys love it. And I feel like you guys are some of the coolest, most positive people that I've ever come across on the Internet. I think it's a, it's an amazing, it's an amazing moment when we've collected so many really cool and friendly and fun people that follow us. If you think about the amount of negative

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       tweets that you get, an amount of negative shit that you get, it's so small in relationship to how many cool people there are out there. How many cool stories you get tweeted, funny things, you know, uh, answers to questions. I think we're super, super lucky, man. You know, I think we're putting out a cool vibe and I think we're putting out an in an honest way of looking at the world and people are responding and we're responding back and it's the most fun I've ever had to accommodate. It's the most fun I've ever had doing anything, you know, that you would call like, like in show business, this thing is the most fun for sure. For sure. And it's the most honest. It's the most. I mean it's just, it is what it is, man. There's no preparation, you know, and it's, it's is as open and as honest as we are capable of.

Speaker 3:          02:35:04       And I think, um, I think that helps us. I know it helps me. I know these conversations have been huge for, for breaking things down for me and just kind of reassembling the way I look at the world, you know, and having all these different guests on and have it, all these different people and all these really different intelligent people and really intense opinions and it's super, super beneficial man. And I'm just so happy that we're able to do this. I is the fucking coolest thing I've ever done. I really, really enjoy it. I enjoy it. It's almost right up there with standup. Standup will always be like the sacred top of the food chain, but it's pretty close to it. It's really cool. And the reason why it's cool is how many cool people it impacts and how many cool people who had impacts share their love with us and send that love back at us.

Speaker 3:          02:35:50       And we appreciate the fuck out of it. We talk about it all the time and we just want you to know we love all your dirty bitches. Thank you to the flashlight for keeping it real. Staying with us since the beginning where it was ridiculous that anybody would give us money for this stupid fucking show. If you started today, this is the first episode the ever downloaded. Don't download episode one because it's fucking terrible. Don't down to, I think to. I run out of the room and three or four times and take a shit. I got diarrhea. Um, but uh, it didn't get good for awhile. So, uh, it, it, you know, we never publicize this thing and it sort of just built up on itself naturally and we love it. We couldn't be happier. I just, I've always wanted to have a radio show and I never could get anybody to even think about giving me one, you know, and I really want to get up every morning either.

Speaker 3:          02:36:41       So this is perfect. Perfect. Perfect. No middleman, right to the people in Atlanta. Uh, tickets are sold out, I believe for the first show at the Tabernacle on April 20th. Um, but there's still some tickets available for the second show and that is where I'm going to be filling my next special. I'm fucking super pumped about this. This is for real, the best shit I've ever done. I've been doing a lot of standup lately. I'm in the groove, like we had a great time this weekend at the county of Magic Club. That place is so beautiful. And then this weekend we're in Louisville at the Improv all weekend, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. And they're supposedly

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       some crazy basketball thing. Like it might be a huge problem with no one's gonna want to come to the show was going to be crazy. It's going to be. I've been worn 19 times on twitter about this event. They said I should put a TV onstage while the game is on and allow people to watch it while we talk. I'm totally cool with that. Really. I think it would be fun. Fucking blast. I think it'd be fun. I think it'd be fun. It'd be fun because I don't know what the fuck is going on and I want them to stop this nonsense game. We please do that. Yeah, we could totally do that. Can totally do that. Yeah, because I think that'll help people come to the show too. If so, if the Improv can figure that out, we'll do that poster Joe. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:37:52       We'll tell people about it too, because most of the people listening. Oh yeah, so I got this. I've had this poster made, which is I'm only making 666 of them and they're these giant posters, these incredible, awesome posters that Joe just in mcalester, this amazing artists made of me getting possessed by my satanic puppet. As you could see, this is it. Once we get 666 cities through all the homes in America, they will make a chaos vortex and the senior clarity will happen. So please purchase one of these posters. If I need one signed done deal. I'm tempted to give you six, six, six, six, six, six. I'll take it. I'll take it. That's a good lucky number for me. Um, that's it to, to the end of listen, you guys have been cool as fuck. You've been with us. Some of you from the very beginning. And uh, that's, that's ridiculous. I can't believe you stuck out this long. Crazy. And we can't believe how many people enjoy the show. We love doing it and there's nothing more I can say. I know Brian feels the same way.

Speaker 5:          02:38:55       Yeah. Yeah. It's sweet.

Speaker 2:          02:38:59       Well, what is it like to you? I mean, it was our 200th episode, Dude, just tell these people how it feels.

Speaker 5:          02:39:03       It's a lot of talking about stuff that happens in your life and now you know us more than better. My friend Shane, a green, he had it. He's having a baby today. He knows. He's like my best friend. You guys at home know me way more than he knows me and he's talking on the podcast like, you know more about all of us that and it's freaky as fuck. But what's also cool is, you know, it feels like you're. I mean, you know me better than my best friend. How fucking crazy is that?

Speaker 2:          02:39:35       Somebody come up to me on the street and after a few minutes talking, they asked me about my friend in college email and they knew his name. They were like, how's it going man? It's like, dude, I don't. That's something that someone would find out about me months into a friendship at barely. Remember the podcast is a strange thing. It's the best thing that ever happened for us for standup. Now people go, when you go on stage, they know what you're going to do. They know you're a fucking Weirdo. It look forward to it. They get excited about it. Thank God. You know, and look, that's it. That's all I could say. We, we appreciate that. You guys appreciate it. And by no means we take it for granted,

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       it's very, very important to us and that's exactly why the podcast is going to remain free. It's always going to be free. I'm never going to do this thing for money. I'll figure out a way to make money. Well, we'll move it around, but I love the idea of putting something out there that is absolutely 100 percent free. And uh, you know, that's what we've managed to do. I know a lot of people think that our ads are too long, but whatever bits off free, it's not like fast food. You can fast forward through it. And by the way, it's like, you know, I mean, what does that flashlight. You're doing something with it. Um, by the way, it's not like you have to listen to that part. Don't be silly. So everything else is freaking, yeah, don't buy a flashlight if you don't need one, but if you want one, they're awesome.

Speaker 3:          02:40:56       Go to flashlight.com and I in the code name Brogan. Save yourself 15 percent off the number one sex toy for men's number one bitches is a bunch of different textures and shit. If you want to get crazy, if you're a con of sewer fee, what is it they call you a foodie. If you're a food connoisseur, what do they call you? If you're a sex toy person, are you a sexy? Do would you call it sexy? Well, I'm a sexy. You know, I, I tried toys. I think two things in my ass. I'm a big on dildos libraries. Once I got past that feeling of something in my ass, they need that show. Like the guy who goes around and eat food, there's a big guy goes around and talks everything fucking sexy. It's totally possible. You could do a series of that on for like an Internet porn site.

Speaker 3:          02:41:36       Brian talked to one of your people in the industry. You know, people that shit would work. There'll be a good, uh, you could have a comic. Do it, have a comic. You know what? Triple e type character. AAA, AAA. AAA would be perfect. We should do. We should start producing our own shows. We start producing our own shows. That's what the next move is. We're going to hire a goddamn camera guy and start doing anytime we have an idea for a sketch would just do it that, that needs to be done. A guy who just travels around the country and fucks everything goes in our outside one of these sticks things in his ass and tells you what it felt like. Well, you know, I don't like something in my ass, but it makes you come way harder. So he's got a fucking vibrator in there.

Speaker 3:          02:42:17       Will be a great show. Yeah. We just wouldn't be able to show it all. You have to hide. Hide Shit from people. Go to a fleshlight, go buy yourself some, some goodies. Okay. That's the end of that commercial. Go to [inaudible] dot com. If you want to. You don't have to. O n n I t. That is where you can buy all the crazy new tropics and supplements that we talked about and coming soon, we're going to have some ridiculous exercise equipment that'll show you guys. It's going to blow your mind. It's going to freak you out. Um, that's it. That's the end of our 200 podcasts. We thank you very much. We appreciate you very much and we'll be back next week. You dirty bitches. God is love
