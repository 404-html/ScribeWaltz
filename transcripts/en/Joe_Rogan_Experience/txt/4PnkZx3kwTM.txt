Speaker 1:          00:00:00       The Gay folks took over the rainbow for three to, will it work today, Jamie?

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       Yes. Hello Nicholas. Hey Joe. How are you man? Great to meet you. It's really good to meet you too. Ah, I became aware of you like many people did with the infamous Halloween costume incident at Yale. Uh, where, uh, explain that for people who don't know what happened cause it was kind of a crazy scene. It went national. Yes, it was a moment when, uh, around the country, many students were struggling with how to balance the conflicting, um, sort of needs a little bit closer to your face. They are conflicting needs. Uh, uh, how on the one hand to create an environment at schools where people, everyone sort of felt welcome as we've democratized, uh, admissions to our American universities is I think we should have people from all walks of life have started moving into these institutions claiming them for their own, which I think is appropriate.

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       But at the same time these institutions had wonderful heritage is of commitment to free expression and open debate and um, and reason as a principal for resolving our differences. And US and some of those values came into tension. And so around the country, there was a lot of heat about this. And I happened to walk into a propeller, uh, myself and, and wound up, um, in some challenging circumstances. And, um, you know, I, I, it was not, it was not the worst thing that's ever happened to me, but, you know, it was sitting in the top 10, uh, challenging moments I've had in my life, let's say. Yeah, that's a very lawyer, like way of describing exactly what happened.

Speaker 2:          00:01:51       I mean, the thing is, I, you know, I, I, I, you know, I struggle. I mean, you can tell the story if you want and then I can correct things. But here's the thing, it's, it's my job to be a teacher and I have taken responsibility for teaching young people. And it is the case that many people lost their minds. I mean, lost their senses. And, and, and the faculty too, incidentally. I mean, you know, there, it's one thing to talk about people in there, in college age people, but then, you know, the faculty also didn't necessarily do what they should've done, but, um,

Speaker 2:          00:02:22       but the thing is, is that, you know, my commitment, my commitment is to, is to teaching more generally. And I don't want to be defined by that event. I don't want that to become a, the most important thing about me, you know, have this book or this book that we're going to talk about that is an important thing in my life. Instantiates my values. It talks about what I think is important about the world. So, so I'm trying to be balanced about it. Just, it's one thing that happened. I did my best. It's in the past. So let me, let me help out here because you're being so nice about the whole thing. Um, so people know what we're talking about. There was a, an incident that was on someone's

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       cell phone where you were standing here, people, it was an hour of footage, five or six different angles. So a clip went viral, but I want to emphasize that there were many people filming that day and an hour or more of the two or three hours I was out there as available. But I'm glad that you had the courage to do that though, to stand out there and talk to those kids. But some of them were clearly, there's something that happens when people become extremely self indulgent when they know that they have this platform and they, uh, have someone who is in a position of authority and they get to hamstring them in front of the public. And that's what I felt was going on to, is my understanding of human nature. I knew what she was doing, what she was doing by shouting and screaming, this is our fucking home.

Speaker 3:          00:03:44       You know, w, you know, we were supposed to be safe here. I was like, oh, I see what's going on. She's throwing up the flag of virtue for all of her friends to see how amazing she was. So she's putting on a show. People do that. It's, it's, it's human nature. You handled it admirably. You stood there and you, you just listened to her and you never yelled back and you never raise your voice and you remained calm. But that sort of environment where the children, and I want to say children, they're basically adults, but acting like children. This is one of the ironies that the people that age, you know, can fight in wars and lose their lives. And so I think it's a, it's a difficult challenge because on the one hand it's right and appropriate to hold people responsible for their actions.

Speaker 3:          00:04:31       Certainly if you're 20 years old, you're an adult, you're still growing, you're still changing, you're still learning. I'm not the same man I was when I was 20 but you have to be responsible for your behavior. Yes. I don't think you get a total pass either. It's hard now. You do not get a total pass. And you know, for folks who don't have a 20 year old in their life and don't remember what it was like, you know, you're not a fully formed thing yet. You're, you're filled with chaos, emotions and hormones and yes. And then you're at school and you're probably a way from the instructions of your parents for the first time and you know you're cutting loose and trying out new new ways of communicating that way. It's, it's a lot of, it's a mess. But most people felt horrified watching that, that you were subjected to that when you're being very reasonable.

Speaker 3:          00:05:24       And also what it all came about was your wife had sent out an email saying like, hey, maybe it should be okay for someone to wear a fucked up Halloween costume. You know, maybe it's okay to, for someone to dress up like crazy horse. We have, well we'll actually, just to be clear, what Erica was saying in that note was not, this is very important intellectual distinction. I think we've, we've lost a lot of nuance in our political lives in general in our country right now. And also in the, in the nuance and the way we think about difficult topics. So Erica was saying

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       was not that necessarily the people, she was not taking a position on any particular costumes like this is okay. In fact, many of the costumes that would have offended the students would offend her. But she was saying was that she didn't think the university should be telling students what to wear. And she was asking the students, do you students really at this age at Yale, do you really want the university to be sending you guidance on what to where? Perhaps you should think about that. You're adults, you're smart, you're in an environment that privileges free expression. Do you really want to grab the power to an institution to tell you how to communicate? And people then a thought that she was saying that, uh, that she was defending a particular course of action. What she was saying was, um, you, uh, she was saying, do you students really want to surrender that kind of control over your own lives to older adults?

Speaker 2:          00:06:54       And apparently many students did actually. They wanted, they did. They did. So I don't believe they did. I think they wanted absolute enforcement of what they thought to be wrong or right. Yes. Yes. I think that's right. So they, they, they, uh, they did the many but not all of the students. I mean, let's, let's also be very clear and in part of the motivation in, in Erica a writing that note was that, uh, many, uh, many of her students and in fact many hundreds of other students felt infantilized by this policy. And there had been a big buildup prior to that event, including an article in the New York Times about these Halloween costume policies around the country and weren't they kind of ridiculous. And so there was a, there was a kind of a, a ferment where people were saying, wait a minute, do we really need adults to be told in this institution, especially given its commitments to open expression, uh, what to wear.

Speaker 2:          00:07:54       And keep in mind that there could be many ways in which a costume that offends you might not, might, I might not know why. So let's say you had been abused by a priest and you were that one of the rules said you shouldn't, a mock religion for example, was what one of the Pr, one of the provisions. So, so a a university wide email went out, signed by 13 people saying, um, you know, don't, don't, uh, don't mock people's deeply held faith traditions. Well, what if for the sake of argument, you had been abused by a priest and you want it in Halloween to dress up as a Catholic priest, for example. Uh, you know, holding a doll and someone else who had a different, who was Catholic was very deeply offended by that. Well, who should adjudicate that? Like, you know, is it the role of the institution to come down and say, yes, you can express yourself this way.

Speaker 2:          00:08:46       No, you cannot. And so the argument was let the young people learn, let them sort it out themselves. Let them learn by talking to each other, expressing themselves, saying, you know, that hurts my feelings. Here's why it hurts my feelings. And the other person say, oh, I understand, or I don't understand, I reject that reason. And, and sort of buy into a kind of commitment to free and open expression that actually I think ultimately serves the objectives of righteous social progress. If we really want to do better in our society or in any society in my view, we have to create an environment where we can talk to each other, grant, good faith, uh, listen carefully, make subtle distinctions and, and free people up to express what they're thinking so we can have a real marketplace of ideas. That's, you know, my commitment or my belief.

Speaker 2:          00:09:36       Well that's a wonderful belief. I love it. I mean that's really a, I couldn't agree with you more, more enthusiastically. That's really, that sounds like the best possible environment for growing up and learning. As long as you have someone to sort of moderate or someone to mediate if things go sideways. Yes. Or I don't think you necessarily need a third party mediator, but you do need a shared understanding of, of a core liberal principles. And these principles do include, as I mentioned earlier, I kind of commitment to free and open expression, a commitment to debate, a commitment to reason. So how are you and I going to come to a better understanding of what is true about the world we could fight, right? And then the, the stronger person would decide what's right. We could vote. Doesn't seem quite right either. You know, a 350 cardinals voted that Galileo was wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:10:29       That didn't make Galileo wrong. Or we could use principles of reason, an inquiry to try to appreciate the world together, right? We're looking out at the world and saying, that's confusing. You know, does the sun, does the earth revolve around the sun or does the sun revolve around the earth? Or that's confusing. Should a king have monarch, you know, should a king has ultimate authority in a state or is that not how we want to organize a state? So we, you and I look at the world and debate and think about, okay, and we exchange reasons and we use evidence and ways of understanding and studying the world. That to me is the only way to truth. Actually. Now, some people will think that religion is a way to truth, right? They think that the truth is, you know, has god given. For example, now I am very sympathetic to religious belief systems, but I don't think that's a way to truth that it's a way to, some truths actually it's a way to some some wisdom, but anyway, so that's what our universities and our society, our universities are officially committed to that the mottos of our universities are all about free inquiry and pursuit of knowledge and our country is committed to that in our bill of rights, right.

Speaker 2:          00:11:35       We have a commitment to free and open expression, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion and so forth and, and those ground rules then in my view, make it possible for us to have a better society and, and there's more academic. Well, I'm sure we will get into it. No, I'm sure we will. Again, I couldn't agree with you more. Yeah. I

Speaker 4:          00:11:53       just think we need more reasonable conversations and the screaming and shouting people down and less toxic mob action. Yes. Yes. The mob action is very weird because I don't remember it well from the like from the Vietnam war protests to what's going on today. There was this long gap where you didn't hear about university shutting down speech. This is fairly new. This is within the last half decade or so.

Speaker 2:          00:12:25       Well let's not yet. Yes, yes. I mean they're always there. There's always an undercurrent of tension about this at, at universities and in our society at large. Uh, you know, let's not forget the McCarthy era where you had the right wing was, you know, really interested in shutting down communists. Like if you were a professor or an artist who had far left political views, you were screwed and that's what's wrong.

Speaker 4:          00:12:49       Or even if you would want went to a communist meeting, find out what it was all about. Yes. Just to,

Speaker 2:          00:12:54       yes, yes. In fact, that's a great example because that's like right now I see a lot of people being criticized for following online people they disagree with, which is nuts. Crazy. So I just, because I follow someone doesn't mean I agree with what they're saying. I'm interested to learn. What are they saying? I'm friends with people. I don't agree with me too. I'm friends with so many people that go to agree with. I have a friend, I have, I have friends across the political spectrum from the, I don't have any monarch. Yes. Among my president reservoir or Monica. But I have friends with the far right to far left. I have a friend who really believes he's sold libertarian. He thinks there should be private ownership of roads. Uh, whoa. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I think that's ridiculous. And we debate. He, you know, must be white is actually my wife says she would just once like to meet a poor libertarian female libertarian.

Speaker 2:          00:13:48       Yes. No. Yeah. That's a ridiculous position. I think so. Private roads get the fuck out of it. Yeah. Okay. But so here's the thing, but okay, how are we going to persuade this man that he's, he also thinks somewhat less controversially. It's harder decision. He also thinks that you, you shouldn't be, you should be able to sell your book, your organs. You know, we should have a market and kidneys, uh, that you, you know, you right now you're alive. Yeah. You can give away one of your kidneys, but yeah, you can, we allow you to give it away. But we don't allow you to

Speaker 4:          00:14:19       sell it. Wasn't there an instance, Jamie, that you were telling me about, about a young guy who was sold as kidney to get an iPhone? Does that in another country, another country? Yes. Yes. And wound up having an infection and lost his second kidney as well. Yes. And then would need to be under yes. These things. Yeah. And these things, these things happen in the, but in the United States, it's prohibited. You can't do that. You also can't sell your blood in the United States. There's a reason for that. Yes. And that's a good reason. A good public health reason. Yeah. Because people who want to sell their blood are usually fun.

Speaker 2:          00:14:48       Correct. And so it's not a safe, the blood supply is in countries where you were people terribly altruistically doing it. Exactly, yes. But the kidney is a harder case anyway. He believes that he, he, he, anyway, so I love debating him and I learned from it. Like recently, he said to me and I, and I think I have a better answer. He said, he doesn't understand why blackmail is illegal, but a point is it goes hand or kiss, anarchists and Libertarians, all of them need their asses kicked there. Really do. Exactly. But the, these are like, and I think 80 kind of extreme ideology, but the point is we can learn, there is some wisdom almost anywhere, right? And, and the problem comes from excess expression. You know, the, the, the problem comes from, um, you know, there's, there's, there, there, there the problem comes, you know, when we take things to extremes and we get to, you know, private ownership of roads.

Speaker 2:          00:15:47       But anyway, and by the way, if you're an anarchist or a libertarian, I'm kidding. I don't really pitch when you get your ass kicked. I'm just joking around. But it is a mob after, it's a position that I always feel like to be remedied with psychedelic drugs. It could be, yes. Almost always could be. Like, I get, you know, I just, I get where they're coming from. I understand personal responsibility. The idea that the free market should decide, get all that, but we are ready except that there's some things that we agree on that we should all chip in to pay for. Like, like roads. Yeah. Or like assessment abilities. Well yeah, are like assessment of drug purity for example. So the very rich could set up a laboratory in their basement. So whenever a doctor prescribes a medication, they could see if the drugs are safe and pure.

Speaker 2:          00:16:34       The rest of us pay taxes. Now we say we're all going to pitch in together and we're going to have the FDA and they are going to certify drug purity so that when I go to my pharmacist and by a drug, the pharmaceutical companies and killing me by shotty manufacturing practices. Yes. So I think that's right. We get together and as a free society and we do these things, we want a non-corrupt judiciary. Right? We don't want people to be able to bribe judges. Shore. Exactly. Yeah. So there are certain foundational elements of our civilization of our society, which are crucial to our wellbeing. And one of them is the capacity to openly debate ideas and to expose ourselves to ideas across the gamut. And I'm not just talking about political ideas, I'm talking about scientific ideas. So how are we going to win the battle against anti-vaxxers? Like how are we going to persuade people who believe that vaccines killed people for which there is no scientific evidence that they're wrong. We could imprison them like that's force. Uh, we could vote, which is sort of what we're doing. We're saying, okay, well you're a minority group who believes these things so we're not going to allow you to control policy. Or we could try to win the battle of ideas and persuade them. Ultimately, that's the only path in my view that gets us to where we want to be. Yeah. And

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       just an honest assessment of the actual data, like what we really know and understanding how the scientists come to these conclusions. But the problem is these echo chambers where people get involved with online that magnify all of these beliefs and you get radicalized. I mean, I've seen true people get involved in these Facebook groups. He's anti-vaxxer faces or Facebook groups or you know, all, all sorts of different things. I mean that's how these flat earth people get going. They start listening only to people that are involved in this circle. They don't have a greater understanding of the science involved in,

Speaker 2:          00:18:27       did you just see, I just saw online their sec a cruise to the flat or cruise for a flat earth. I don't know if you saw it too. The ice wall. Yeah, the ice wall. Ooh, that's a new wrinkle. Cause the old flat earthers used to think that the water was shown falling off the disc of the earth. You know, like the edge of the earth. They was just a disc. Now the new theory that there's an ice wall, actually, it's kind of not falsifiable B, that is to say you, you could get on a cruise and sail to the edge of the earth and you would find a wall of ice there. So you Antarctica. So you'd think, Huh, it's flat. In other words, they, they, they have redefined their theory too to make it so that you can't disprove it. Right. You don't get to an edge, there's no edge. There's an ice wall is what they're saying. No. And Are you aware of Hashtag spaces fake? No, I'm not. I have to say it right

Speaker 4:          00:19:18       and not expose myself to that space. There's a bunch of people that believe that space is fake, but it's not real. But there's no real space and that there's like lights up there. Oh and that this is some sort of a plan by Satan. It's a lot of, it's very biblical. It's really interesting. A lot of the flat earth stop is very biblical. That's it has to do with the firmament. And they use descriptions and depictions from the Bible. Oh yeah. It's super bizarre. And what's really bizarre is when you listened to the youtube videos or these discussions that are done by people that use words that are real, they string them together correctly. They have like full sentences, they appear to be articulate. It's very confusing if you're a dummy, if you listen to those ego like wow, this guy's making a lot of sense. He's not. But it sounds like he's making a lot of sense cause he's using all these words that are correctly, users know oms he saying it articulately. There's like everything seems like like, oh my God, this man is exposing. He's exposing the reality. But it's not. It's just fucking nonsense. And if you don't know any better, and that's all you listened to, that's where your head will go. The same with the Anti Vaccine Movement. If you only listened to these anti-vaxxers, they're making so much sense like, oh my God, it's giving everybody uh, all sorts of ailments.

Speaker 2:          00:20:41       And they have a theory of how it does that, which is not, it's uses as you say, scientific words, but it's actually not correct.

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       Do you know it does this, which then does that, which then does that, they lay out a kind of causal chain, which is false. And then there's a problem of nuance in perspective because there's so many people that get vaccinated. There's hundreds of millions of people in this country, billions of people worldwide. And then there are instances, rare occurrences where people have real issues with vaccinations. Well, there are some where they have real issues. So for example, there's some vaccines which are known to cause certain neurological conditions, rarely went out of a million or one out of 100,000 vaccinations. More commonly is a situation in which you have vaccination is so common. Everyone is getting vaccinated and often that occurs near to an occurrence of some other rare condition. And people associate the two they think, oh, because of the vaccine, this happened. No, it's a coincidence either or.

Speaker 3:          00:21:35       Yes, there's both in the, and there's also, you know, if it's one out of a million and you have 300 million, exactly. You have 3 million. 1 million people with an issue is a big deal. Yeah. With 300 million people. Yes. You, you easily could have 300 really big cases, you know, 300 cases where if something died from vaccines and then you bring those in front of people and say, Oh my God. And then there's this one and this one, this one, and there's 298 more. And you're like, Holy Shit, all these people are dying from vaccines. As you know, it doesn't feel good if it's your child, but when we look at the greater perspective of humanity and you say, well listen, you don't want to bring back smallpox. You don't want your child to get measles. Babies can get measles when they can't even be vaccinated for it. This is one of the reasons why we need to vaccinate children is to make sure they don't get measles is a serious fucking problem and a serious problem that scientists have labored for untold decades to try to try off of our civilization.

Speaker 3:          00:22:36       That we can actually stop these diseases. Yes. And save children's lives. I had a woman yesterday who is an expert. She's a medical historian and expert in Victorian era surgery. Uh, Lindsey Fitzharris and she wrote this great book called the butchering art and in it there's all these images. Should she, one of them, she brought up of what smallpox actually looks like when people get it, it's horrible. It just covers people's bodies. Yes, you've eradicated this like painful and you die from it. It's actually gone. Yes. We don't get it into in this country as funny where credible, it's credible. But that's obviously neither here nor there. So this book a blueprint, the evolutionary origins of a good society. When did you start this? About nine or 10 years ago. Uh, and I, at the time in my lab we were doing research on friendship. We were doing research on, on why people have friends. It's actually, it's not, it's not difficult to provide an account for why we have sex with each other. Uh, many animals, most animals are, well, I don't know if it's most, but animals either reproduce sexually or asexually and most animals, I'm trying to remember now what the relative proportions anyway, mama

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       say most, most animals reproduce sexually. And it's not hard to provide an account for how, um, for why we, why sex originated, why we reproduce sexually. It's not hard to provide an account for. Why we are choosy in our mates are why we are careful in who we have sex with. But human beings don't just mate with each other. We befriend each other. We form longterm non reproductive unions to other individuals to whom we're not related. Why that's very rare in the animal kingdom. Very few creatures do this. We do it. Certain other primates, elephants, certain whales and that's mostly it. So the question is why. So I became very interested in my lab and trying to understand the deep origins of friendship. Why would natural selection have equipped us with his capacity? And that set the stage then for an exploring all kinds of other things in our lives, like why we love each other.

Speaker 2:          00:24:39       For example, why do we, why do we, when we have a sex with a person, we tend to become attached to them. We develop emotional sentiment about them. That's not an essential to having sex yet. We do that. And then I became interested in other kinds of good things like not into just love and friendship, but cooperation and teaching. Teaching is another crazy thing. We take it for granted that we teach each other. But think about this. Most animals are able to learn. So a little fish in the ocean learns that if it swims to the light, it finds more food there. So the fish then learns to, to, to be tropic, to move towards the light. Uh, and that's individual learning. Some animals, uh, developed what's called social learning. Social learning is really efficient. So if I put my hand in the fire, I learned that I burned myself.

Speaker 2:          00:25:30       I pull my hand out, I've learned something, I paid a price and I learned something. I could observe you putting your hand in the fire. You pay all the price. But I gained most of the knowledge. It's almost as good. I learned, oh people, you shouldn't put your hand in the fire saw that Joe put his hand in the fire. So social learning is super efficient learning from others, but we take it to an even further level. We don't just passively observe other EH, other animals of our own species and learn from them. We teach each other. That is very rare in the animal kingdom where one animal sets out to teach and other animal something. So the book is a, is, is, uh, is about the evolutionary origins of a good society. It's also a kind of a response to kind of push back to a long tradition in the sciences of attention to the bad parts of our nature.

Speaker 2:          00:26:21       You know, uh, scientists in my view have for too long been looking at the origins of, of murder and tribalism and selfishness and mendacity. Um, but, but I think the bright side has been denied the attention it deserves because we have also evolved to love and to befriend each other and to be kind to each other and to cooperate and to teach each other and all these good things. And I'll shut up and please don't know. And, uh, and here's the thing. Here's the sort of one way to think about this. This must have been the case that the benefits of a connected life outweighed the costs. We would not be living socially. If my exposure to you harmed me and Annette. Other words, if I came near you and you were violent to me, you killed me or you gave me misinformation, you told me lies about the world than my connection to you would ultimately harm me, that I should be better off living as an isolated animal.

Speaker 2:          00:27:22       So animals that come together to live socially there, the benefits of that must outweigh the costs. My living us living as a group. So all this attention to the ways in which our interactions are bad, that we kill each other, that we steal from each other, that we lie to each other, that we have tribalism and all of these traits which we do every century is replete with horrors. I'm not like Pangloss like I don't think like, you know, Pollyanna like, oh, everything's great. That's not me. But what is me is a kind of optimistic focus on the good parts of our, of human nature and the recognition that those good parts must in toto overwhelmed the bad parts. While they certainly have to, there's so many human beings. I mean it's obvious that this is working. Yes, we have propagated where everywhere on every single patch of land that's occupiable.

Speaker 2:          00:28:15       In fact, you're, you're exactly right. The argument, and that's discussed in the book, the way we have achieved the kind of social conquest of the earth, the way our species is, is as spread out to occupy every niche, which is also very rare. Most animals live in one, you know, grizzlies live in, in this part of the world. They don't live in Amazonia. And, uh, you know, polar bears live in this part of the world. They don't live in, in Arizona, et Cetera. So, so, uh, but our species lives everywhere. And the way we have come to be able to do that is by the capacity to have culture, to teach and learn from each other, to accumulate knowledge. So in the book I talk about lots of this, a famous set of stories called the last European explorer files about how European explorers are lost.

Speaker 2:          00:29:01       They lose their supplies, they wind up dying. And um, but they're in an environment in which other people thrive and survive because they have learned to how to live there. So we've spread out around the world and then don't, there's a chapter in the book at the beginning about shipwrecks. So, so I have this, should I go on chaplain? Yeah, I have this, I have this. Uh, so, so what I'd like to do is, what I tried to set out to do in the beginning of the book is I say, look, it's clear that our genes shaped the structure and function of our bodies. It is increasingly clear that our genes also straight shape the and function of our minds, our behaviors, whether you are risk averse, uh, how intelligent you are. Uh, uh, whether you, uh, have wanderlust, uh, these properties are properties that depend in part on your genes.

Speaker 2:          00:29:54       But it's also clear to me, and that's what the book argues, is that our genes shape not just the structure and function of our bodies, not just the structure and function of our minds, but also the structure and function of our societies. And to really prove that what we would need is something known as the forbidden experiment. And the forbidden experiment is an experiment in which we took a group of babies who had never been taught anything, who are a cultural, had no culture and stranded them on an island and left them on their own to see what kind of society they would make when they grew up. You know, how would they organize themselves socially? Is there kind of an innate society that human beings are prewired to make in an essence? Now, obviously that's unethical and cruel, but actually monarchs for thousands of years of contemplated this experiment.

Speaker 2:          00:30:41       So Heraclitus writes in about how one of the ancient Egyptian Pharaohs wanted to know what kind of language would, what was a natural language we had in us that we would speak if we were not taught language. So this pharaoh, it is said took two babies and gave them to a mute Shepard Terez to see how did the children's speak when they grew up and uh, and, and, and uh, the emperor Akbar attempted this, there was a couple of European kings at attempted this. Obviously we can't actually do this. So what I do in the book is I look at a series of other approximations of that. And one chapter is devoted to looking at shipwrecks groups of men typically, but sometimes men and women who, between 1500 and 1900, there were 9,000 shipwrecks, many more thousands of ships were lost at sea. And in 20 of those cases we found 20 cases where, uh, at least 19 people were stranded for at least two months.

Speaker 2:          00:31:34       And, uh, you know, here's the, there's a kind of, um, here's a map of the, uh, I'm going to, well, here's one crew I can tell you about, but here's a map of the, of the shipwrecks. Like these are the, Oh wow. The all over the world where they occurred and, uh, when they occurred and how many people there were. And uh, and so then I, uh, I got all the original accounts from the sailors, from the people on the wrecks and all contemporary archeological excavations of those wrecks were where they had been excavated. And, um, and try to understand what kind of society did these isolated cruise actually wind up making. And there was some amazing stories that were, uh, that I found in there. So the stayed for at least two months. How many of them actually established a real civilization? How many, well, forever, no, no one was stuck forever.

Speaker 2:          00:32:23       Uh, most of those crews were eventually, in fact, all of those crews had at least one survivor because if they had all died, then I wouldn't be able to know about them. But there's a one famous case in which these sailors, uh, were stranded in near Australia, I think somewhere in the Pacific. And they managed to catch a big petrol, one of those huge birds that, you know, like a condor. And uh, and they, they, they put a little note in a little tiny bottle and they tied it to its feet. And this petro flew thousands of miles and landed in Australia and was found with a note indicating where the ice stranded sailors were. And a ship was sent to go find the men and the got there, but they had all died. They were all gone. So they use this, this, uh, this bird. So the bird, well, no, they didn't eat the bird. They push. No.

Speaker 2:          00:33:15       I think if you had that choice, you would communicate rather than eat Joe. I think. Yes. Yeah. For a little bit. Well until the very end as yes, yes. But, uh, they starved to death. We don't know. Nobody knows. But the point is that we have to, for me to be able to describe what happened, we needed at least one survivor. Often. There were many cases where everyone survived. I mean, there was one pair of cases that I was amazing to me in 1846 in south Auckland islands, just north of Antarctica, south of New Zealand. Uh, the, uh, the Grafton was racked on the southern part of the island. I can't remember how big the island was. It's in the book and maybe let's say 90 miles long or something or 20 miles long thing. It's 20 miles long on the southern part of the island.

Speaker 2:          00:34:01       Uh, five men are wrecked on the Grafton and, uh, on the northern part of the island, the Invico rex, 19 men are wrecked on the INVICO. Uh, all the graft and cruise survives the, and both feet. Both crews were on the island at the same time. They never encountered each other. They're struggling for survival. It's like an, like an experiment. Like who's going to win? Tempted to say fear factor. Yeah. And uh, and, and the question is who's going to survive and how and why. Everyone in the graft and crew survives, and 16 of the 19 men on the, uh, on the INVICO crew die. And there's also cannibalism in that crew. So it's a, it's a very, it's a very different outcome for various reasons. So anyway, so the point is that in the book I start with a series of stories about how people come together to make, attempt to make new civilizations.

Speaker 2:          00:34:56       I use the example of unintentional communities with, uh, with shipwrecks. I have, I looked at it, intentional communities like communes and um, and uh, kibbutzes in Israel and a 1970s communes in the United States, a 19th century communes in the United States. Actually going back to Roman times, there've always been groups of people who've said, society's fucked up. I'm going to go. And we're going to make it again. You know, we're going to start a fresh. Um, I look at settlements in Antarctica of scientists. I look at the Pitcairn, you know, the mutiny on the bounty. I look at the Shackleton expedition. Many, many cases of stranded, isolated groups of people trying to make a new social order. And then I also use data from experiments we do in my lab. We have this software where tens of thousands of people have come and played these games. We, we can create these temporary artificial societies of real people where people come and spend an hour or two and we would as God like wake an engineer, the society, we can have a lot of inequality or little inequality or various other features. And then we can observe what happens. And I look at all of that data, all those stories and say, look, there is a deep and fundamental way that no matter what human beings, uh, make a society their underlying fundamental principles about society, which are as innate as the fact that you have two kidneys. You know, most people, almost everyone or your pancreas makes insulin.

Speaker 2:          00:36:28       But they're very different all throughout the world. Right? I mean there's totalitarian society, no nose, no. So here's the point. No, yes. So here's what, here's the argument. You look around the world and the way the example I give is that yes, there's huge cultural variation around the world. Just like you said, to tell turn societies. There's people have different foods and they have different ways of dressing and there's enormous cultural variation and it's marvelous and interesting and obvious to anybody. But I think we're missing the forest from the trees. To me, this is like you and I are sitting on a plane and we look at a hill that's 300 feet and 900 feet and we say those are very different hills. But actually if he took a step back, we would see that we're on, we were on a plateau and one was a mountain that was 10,300 feet and another was a mountain that was 10,900 feet.

Speaker 2:          00:37:19       And actually there, there are these much more deep and fundamental plate tectonic forces that are creating these two mountains that are very similar. But we are just focused on the superficial top. So the argument in the book is that everywhere in the world, people have friendship. People love their partners, people cooperate, people teach each other. These are fundamental common principals shared by everyone. Even though there's also a lot of variation, even in a place like North Korea. Yes. Now North Korea, that that state, so totalitarian states apply huge cultural pressure to suppress this innate tendency. It's like, it's like a religious, you need a lot of belief in God to suppress your innate desire to have sex. Right? Right. So you can have a belief system that's very powerful, that kind of prevents you, squashes what would otherwise be a kind of in escapable inclination you have.

Speaker 2:          00:38:17       So totalitarian regimes, and this is discussed in the book too, they are very threatened by the institution of the family. They're threatened. You need to owe your loyalty to the state, not to your family, not to your friends. And so they have a series of institutions that, you know, everyone has comrade, everyone called Conrad for example, or, or, uh, uh, there are a lot of, a lot of times, well I won't, I don't want to, I don't know if I want to speak at the state level. Let me, let me take it down a notch to communes. So if you think about communes, if you're going to make a commune of people and you want them to feel real loyalty to the commune, one way you can do that is you want to, uh, reduce the commitment people have to their partners, let's say their, their mates in, in order to do that, you can go to one of two extremes.

Speaker 2:          00:39:07       Either you can prohibit sex, like the shakers and you say, okay, no one is going to have sex with anyone because we're all in a commune and we all love each other and we're not going to have a special love for particular people. Or You could go to the other extreme and you can have polyamory say everyone's going to have sex with everyone else. Once again, you see that subverts the special relationship that people might form with particular individuals. And so both of those strategies, even though they're opposite, are attempting to do the same thing, which is to break down real relationships, face to face, relationship between individuals so that you can have a commitment to this higher group. And that's what totalitarian states also face the same dilemma. And that's also why, incidentally, a lot of the states try to re reduce gender differences, right? They like, you know, the Mao jacket, the men and women all were wearing the similar, similar kind of attire for instance. Uh, because they want to have people see themselves as interchangeable and not as individuals and relationships, not be particular. Did you study cults a little bit? Um, not a lot. Uh, there's some talk a little bit in the book about cults, but I don't really need to get to cults in order to make the arguments that I'm making. No, I mean not even just

Speaker 4:          00:40:20       to make arguments, just to compare because that is essentially like in particularly the Rajneesh called Oregon, the wild, wild west or wild wild country documentary. On Netflix. Did you see that? No, I haven't. It's fantastic. They essentially took over an entire town and started busing and homeless people to vote.

Speaker 2:          00:40:40       Oh, I read about that. I know about this. Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:40:42       It's really quite amazing. And what they did was really weird. You know what I mean? For there's moments in the documentary you're like, wow, maybe they're on to something, and then of course it goes completely sideways and they wind up poisoning people and it's chaos. But I am absolutely fascinated by those types of environments where people do decide they're going to branch off from regular. They don't, they're unsatisfied with regular civilization. They're gonna all move to some location.

Speaker 2:          00:41:10       Yes. That's a, that's a primitive and ancient impulse. Like I was saying, people have been doing that for since time and memorial. It's how America got started. Yes, yes, yes. It's, screw this. I'm going over there to start again. But again and again, when people do that, they keep expressing some of these fundamental beliefs. It's, yes, yes. It's like saying yes. Anyway, go on. No, please. No, no, no. I don't have anything to add. I mean, I just was what you said,

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       but yes, that's right. I mean, I'm, I'm always fascinated by people that are unhappy with the current state of affairs. They don't like the way society feels to them. They don't feel like they belong and they want to try somewhere else. I mean, and what was really interesting to me is the last time someone did this as a country, as far as I know, is the United States. There really is. It's about, I mean, it's also very unique that this is one of the weirdest countries in the world in terms of our ability to freely express ourselves and more guns. Well, the thing about America, that's it, it's like the American experiment would have, is about the fact that anyone can be an American. My parents immigrated from Greece. Uh, I was raised in this country, you know, uh, I, to be an American means to buy into a certain set of principles like the bill of rights and many other countries are very xenophobic.

Speaker 3:          00:42:25       You know, you, you can't become a Japanese. It's, you can't be, you can't be nationalized in Japan. I mean you can, but it's extremely difficult and rare. Uh, so it's a very homogeneous country. Switzerland is another country. It's very difficult to become Swiss. You can't be nationalized as a Swiss. I mean, you can, but it's extremely difficult and rare. So, um, but the United States, you know, we, we say you are an American. If you from all of the whole world, you're welcome. Bring us your tired. Your, you know, the famous saying on the foot on the, your, I forgot the saying, it's very poetic on the bottom of the, of the Statue of Liberty. You're wretched. You're, you're for Lauren, whatever it is. Uh, and you can come to this, these shores and make your life a new. And, um, and all you need to do to be an American is to, um, buy into a commitment to constitutional governance, democratic rule, Bill of rights and these principles.

Speaker 3:          00:43:16       Now we should note that there were millions of people that were brought as slaves and voluntarily to these shores. We don't always realize our best virtues. We allow people to come, but like the Irish and treat them as second class citizens or the Italians or the Greeks even. Um, you know, we, we don't always do that, but, but the idea that you're putting on the table, which I think is correct, is that you can be an American. This is a special, unusual experiment. You can't reinvent yourself quite that way. And to my knowledge, in any other, uh, colony or country, that's why it's one of the weirdest things that this is a country where anti-immigrant sentiments are running rampant. Yes. One of the entire foundation, the country is based on immigration. Yes. The only way people got here, if you're not a native American, it was taken from the native Americans. And everyone's since then is an immigrant or a descendant of an immigrant. That's correct. In the native Americans, they came 20,000. Yes. It's crazy. Yes. The whole thing's crazy. Yes. It's, it's just, and it's such a unique environment for expression. I mean, there's really no other country that has as free expression. Even the Brits don't. That's right. And Canada certainly does. Correct. And they're our neighbors. Yes, it's uh, it's just, it's a

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       very unusual thing. And this unusual thing is the most recent incarnation of a country. Yes, yes. I think that's right. And I think there are, you know, then this ties in with a whole set of ideas about American exceptionalism. You know, are we, how different are we, uh, what is the source of our wealth? What is the height of our civilization? You know, I'm, I'm, I am distressed by some of the direction our country is going in at the moment, but I think the, you know, I think in the long arc of history, I think the United States stands for many of the best principals in the world. And I'm prepared to defend those principles. I am too. And I think what you were saying with your libertarian friend and you know, someone who may be an anarchist or whatever, and then there's, there's room for all these weird opinions.

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       They might not be correct and they will all be represented is just gigantic soup of human beings. It's 300 plus million. It's just the idea that America is like a white nationalists in Charlottesville. This is what's wrong with America. No, what's wrong with America is volume. You know, you're, you're going to have certain ridiculous ideas and awful ideas that are amplified in this volume is incredible. Massive humans. Yes. I think a large, I think that's right. I think our size, uh, contributes to, uh, or makes a kind of heterogeneity of ideas more easy. Uh, you know, if we were tiny country, although even in small democracies, you know, like you go to European countries that are tiny, uh, Spain for example. I mean it's not tiny, but it's tiny compared to us. Uh, you know, there's a lot of difference of beliefs from far left to far.

Speaker 2:          00:46:13       Right. But I think, I think the key aspect, which you're talking about earlier, which again, you're highlighting, which I agree with, is that we want an environment in which people can, the ground rules are clear. So, you know, you can't, there's no physical contact allowed. Right. So we do, we draw a bright line distinction between words and deeds. So I completely reject the idea that words are violent. Violent. Yeah, totally. Yeah. I totally reject that. Uh, and, and because we have different words for it, the two different things, totally different. I mean, we, we, so ground was our, you know, I can't touch you, but I can speak, uh, other ground rules are that we are committed to open expression. A good ground rule would be that we grant positive intent. We grant good intent. That is to say, I tried to put what you're saying in the most favorable light.

Speaker 2:          00:46:58       First I think about it. I say, okay, now wait a minute. What is he saying? What does he mean by that? He, Mike's, uh, now you may be an idiot. A person may be an idiot. They may be viral, they may be violent, they may be wrong. You know, all of those things are also possible, but that's not the first Goto. Um, so anyway, if we set those ground rules, I think, I believe strongly that in the marketplace of ideas, the truth will out, um, and, and righteousness will out. That's, that's what I think. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe in fact, what we need is a benevolent dictator who, you know, comes down and tells us what to think and do, but that's not the world I want to live in. Yeah. The benevolent dictator idea is what does that come from? Like why is it just because it's, that's really been the only way the society is actually functioned for most of the past.

Speaker 2:          00:47:43       Fantasize, right. Every, I mean Plato talks about this, I mean people look around and they think situation is not so great. I really wished it was a strong man that would come down and fix it. Um, this is the inclination towards Trump. I think in some part, yes, Trumpism is a little bit about this fantasy that, that we will, um, you know, that that the way out is to have a kind of imposition from above. And I think that's very dangerous actually. And we were talking about earlier in college campuses, it's the same principle, right? Like the idea that big daddy's going to come down and tell us what to do and fix the situation I think is undemocratic in the end. And painting it has to follow the rules of these children. What I mean, this is part of the issue with the idea of words equal violence.

Speaker 2:          00:48:31       I mean this is not a well thought through idea and this is an idea that is world rewards can lead to violence. Sure. Words can be painful. They can hurt your feelings. Yes, that can be unpleasant. All of that is true, but words are different than violence. They just are. And so I think we need to, you know, and in fact as John Height and uh, and uh, uh, Greg Louisiana argue, we actually might want to create there other reasons to draw the distinction between words and violence and to cultivate an appreciation for that distinction. And that is by allowing people to speak, we may actually reduce violence because we can identify who has these crazy ideas. We know who. So if you're, if, if, if I believe that someone hates people like me and I created an environment in which we allow him to say he hates people like me, I think it's horrible that he hates people like me.

Speaker 2:          00:49:26       I'm not defending that he hates people like me, but we might now know who he is, right as I stay away from him, you know? Uh, so, so that's their argument that look, you in height make that, that actually this is a potentially additional additional benefit of creating a free and open marketplace of ideas is we identify where the crazy is, you know, here are all these people were talking about the anti-vaxxers. I'd like to know who are the people that hold these beliefs because as a public health expert, and I was a hospice doctor for many years, I took care of patients for a long time. Anyway, I was very am still interested in a lot of our projects around the world are public health projects. In order to be able to lead people to wisdom, you have to know where, where's the ignorance? Right? Well, if it's secret, you don't know it. So that's another benefit of fostering this climate of open expression. Yeah. And the, the solution to these bad ideas is for someone to come up and give a better idea. Yes. Someone to debate or to expand what's wrong with it and to do it in a reasonable

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       manner. When people start shouting and screaming and pulling fire alarms, like it's this side, the idea of silencing people from speaking that somehow know that this is going to help. This is a, this is also part of d platforming. Yes. When people call for deep, deep planning, I think that's wrong. Even based on just a reasonable people with differing opinions. It's raw. It's crazy. There's a tach will, Peter Tatchell, there's a, uh, a gay rights activist in, um, in England who went to prison for his rights, was, had been imprisoned in foreign countries for defending a gay rights and he was d platformed in England a couple of years ago. Now here's the problem with d platforming. So first of all, it is totally right and appropriate to protest. So if someone is speaking something you don't want, I will strongly defend, protest, stand outside, yell and scream, hold banners up, whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:51:20       You can't interfere with the right of the speaker to express themselves first point. But even more important. The reason we don't want that is not so much because we're interested in the right of the speaker. It's because we're interested in the rights of the listeners, the people who are want to listen to that person have a right to listen to that person in a free society. So when we prevent them, the harm were causing is not, it's not that I'm silencing you, I'm, I am interfering with the ability of all the people who want to hear you to hear you. It's their rights that matter too. So if we it the D platforming, it's not about, oh, so and so was unable to speak at such and such a place. It's the fact that all the people that want it to hear so and so we're deprived of their opportunity to do so.

Speaker 3:          00:52:06       So I think the answer to words, we do not like the answer to speech. We do not like is more speech. It's not silencing. Yeah. And there's also the, uh, the obvious situation. You put someone in, when you do attempt to silence them, you put them under duress and their message changes you, you make someone more combative. And yes, this has often been the argument for why Trump became president in the first place is that people were tired of the argument on the other side. I mean, I'm not a political scientist and I followed that literature a little bit. Uh, I think there is a strong argument that that is one of the factors that contributed to Trump's a success. Let's keep in mind however, that the majority of Americans voted for Hillary Clinton. Um, and, and, uh, he's a majority of Americans didn't vote correct, but of the people who voted yes, that's right.

Speaker 3:          00:52:56       That's another whole problem. Um, but 63 or so million, uh, I, anyway, about 3 million more people voted for Hillary Clinton than voted for Donald Trump nationally. So, um, so, uh, I forgot how we got onto him. What were you saying? When we're talking about people wanting to silence people? So one of the things, correctness and the rebounding of that is that reinforcing of someone who comes along who's the polar opposite of that? Yes, I would agree with that. And I think that that's another, you know, that sort of is a variant of the argument we were discussing earlier, which is that you, one of the advantages of creating a free and open society is that you allow, you know, live and let live and uh, then you don't, you don't, you, you tend to, um, you avoid creating kind of suppressed animosities or you, you can help to avoid it to open communication is so critical and it's also critical to have reasonable, polite conversation.

Speaker 3:          00:53:51       Like people can oppose each other info in their idea, but you should be able to express how and why you oppose that idea without it being this sort of personal yes. Vendetta. Yes, I agree with that. I mean, you know, I think we have to accept that there will be, people will get angry. I mean that's part of having an open society and I think we need to get a person. Yes. And I think we need to accept that some people, not everyone will, will engage in discourse the way you and I might want to engage in that discourse. Um, but I do agree with you completely that ideally we would have a kind of civilized conversation that allowed us to learn, um, and to grow. And I think ultimately that as we've been saying is, is better for our society as well. Well, I think we should acknowledge that people are going to be upset, but we should also applaud people for not being upset.

Speaker 3:          00:54:43       I think there's a, there's a higher value to people being able to communicate reasonably. Yes, I agree. I don't think that that's reinforced enough and I don't think that's appreciated enough. I can play up high. Don't you want to get any disagreement from me on that? Yes. Yeah. I mean I just, I just think we, this is something that we can do. Yes. And we can get better at it. Well, I think it's like martial arts training, you know, I think that it is self discipline is not an easy thing Joe. And, um, like anything else worth doing in life, like basically anything worth doing takes effort. It's tempting the Goto strategy that many people have. So I think it's important to note that free speech is difficult and is not an easy thing. It's a natural inclination to want to silence your opponents, but it's wrong it and it's harmful and it's actually harmful to you to do that.

Speaker 3:          00:55:33       So, um, so, so I think we need to have an educational system that cultivates, cultivates that, that cultivates the capacity to tolerate an idea that you don't like to think about that idea and then to respond to that idea. Um, so, so, but I, so, so I guess what I'm saying, it's, it's a, it does require some training. It doesn't come naturally, unfortunately, you know, but it should be reinforced. Yes. I think there's a way to do that and there's a way to appreciate that and as a way to call that out when you see it and just, I think the world needs more of it. And if we can figure out a way to do that, we will find that we are differences are not nearly as egregious. They're the not nearly as disgusting as well, like to think that, well, that's exactly what I argue with blueprint, that there's such, you know, like, you know, when you go to a foreign country initially you're overwhelmed by the different food

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       and the different smells and the different architecture and anyone who's traveled even to a different state has had this experience. And yet actually, once you get to know the people, you see that they're very human. They're like us, they love their partners and they hang out with their friends and they work together to build a civilization and a society. And they have schools and they teach and they learn and they do all of these basic things that are a fundamental part of our common humanity. And, and this is what I talk about in blueprint at length. You know, like I, I, uh, you know, I just, I think it's, I think there's a kind of, um, there's a kind of flawed beauty to the world that, ah, captivates me and it's a little bit on the, there's a synthetic tradition in, in, in Japan and a philosophy called Wabi.

Speaker 2:          00:57:09       Sabi. Do you know Wabi Sabi? Sabi is, no, probably know about it, but you may not know the word, so I've heard it, you know, like how, like the western aesthetic for pottery is like these perfectly symmetrical, beautifully glazed, you know, pots. But there's a tradition in Japan of slightly imperfect pots, you know, like a crackpot or a pot that's slightly misshapen. It's very difficult to masters to make these pots. And it's, it's, it's called Wabi Sabi and it's about, it's about how imperfections are kind of beauty of imperfection, a kind of flawed beauty, um, like a hot girl with a gap in her teeth. Yes. I suppose, yes. I suppose that could be an example of that, that, um, or you know, Elle Macpherson, you know, famously had that little, uh, uh, was it her, I forgot, which was the famous model that had Sydney Crawford. Yeah. I had that famous a mole on her face and glassy.

Speaker 2:          00:58:02       So it's a flawed beauty. So, so here's the point. It's not hard to look around the world and see the violence and the murderer in the warfare and the incompetent leadership and all of these awful things about our species, but we're really a fucking unbelievable species actually, who do amazing things when you compare us to other species and there's a kind of flawed beauty to us and I think that it's, it's wrong to be seduced to the dark side. You know, it's wrong to like only focus on those, on the bad stuff. I also think it's a kind of moral and philosophical laziness, right? If we allow ourselves to just think that, oh, you know, people are awful. It kind of relieves us of any duty to be good and to work, to make the world better. It's a kind of, you know, surrender to the dark side.

Speaker 2:          00:58:51       I think that's wrong. And the book shows exactly how and why that's wrong and, and how we, how natural selection has shaped all these wonderful qualities which are shared the world over. So you go to the foreign country, you're initially perplexed by their crazy practices and then slowly but surely you find our common humanity. And I anyway, I find that it's pleasing, at least to me, that perspective, you know, that's one of the cool things about travel, right? You, you broaden your perspective and your understanding of what it means to be a person. Go to these

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       different environments and yourself too. Yeah, yeah. They're different and they're different foods or different art. They're different architecture. And you go, oh, this is also possible to yes, people can live like this. Yes. And do you even begin to see why they live like that? You know, like you initially you go to Greece and you have resin flavored wine, you have it at Siena and you wondering why would these crazy Greeks put pine resin in there ruining perfectly good white wine. And then after awhile you start to say, Hey, actually this is pretty good. Uh, you know, this is not a crazy thing after all. And you acquired case run resident and there were walls. Yes. You know, the first time, the first time I had scotch whiskey, I, I, uh, I didn't know what I thought about it. And now I love whiskey. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:00:03       It's an acquired taste. So the first time you drink something like that, you think, you know, yes. They put resin, they put pine resin in their white wine. They chill it. I should've brought you some, maybe I'll send you on an acquired taste. Ouzo Koolaid. It's delicious from the beginning. Yeah. I just right out of the cold. And this is sweet. Good. Yes, yes, yes. We'll have to convince anybody. Yes, that's right. That's right. Some things that's right. Some things are just good right out of the budget is good. Yes. Kool aid is just good. Yeah. I mean, I don't recommend you drink it all the time. It's full of sugar. It's terrible for you. But damn, that's tough. It's like, it's like a, it's like fried foods, you know? Yeah, sure. Yummy. A lot of them French fries. Yes. I mean, come on man, salt and catch up.

Speaker 3:          01:00:46       You guys know I'm a, I'm not sure about what I should mention, but anyway, I love Popeye's fried chicken. I do as well. I love it so bad. It's awful. And my wife, my wife is unlikely to listen to this full podcast so or I'll, I'll skip over this part so she doesn't hear this part but and my sister will be listening probably and so she will laugh when she gets to this part because whenever I see a Popeye's I just pull over and indulge myself and then I terrible. Terrible. It's Hafez is good. But you know what? If you really want to indulge and you like chicken Roscoe's in La, I have it. No, you don't know. Oh, I don't know. Ascos chicken and waffles. Oh Dude. I tried to go there and get in waffle family. We tried. Don't you make that tried to go there the other day with my family and a half.

Speaker 3:          01:01:34       Wait on the same place on day chicken and waffles course on the same plate. What are you a communist? Yeah, man, it's La Tierra above them too. And butter. Yeah. You mean the chewiness? Yes. It perfectly. It's damn delicious in my mind. Yet from another pant I, I make maple syrup. I live in Vermont and I make Maple Syrup. I tap my own trees and wow. What a freak. I have a, I have a, yeah, exactly. Giving people a hard time for waffles and chicken again. Show me the colonel. The colonel is a liar. He does not have it. Get out of here. It's not even the colonel. The colonel is norm Macdonald.

Speaker 3:          01:02:15       Norman said temporary like promotion or something. This is nonsense. Yeah, but they do, oh my gosh. I got a waffle. The syrup goes on top of the chicken that chicken and waffles and chicken tastes like cat litter compared to Roscoe's. Also sweet chick La. He could try to get this outta here. Uh, so, uh, it's tough. Can go fuck off Roscoe's chicken and waffles. You get the Greens to the Collard Greens. That's fine. Damn good. That's fine. But that's a waste of maple syrup. Take it from the man who makes it to put it on chicken. Chicken is good. I'm sure. Sweet. It's nozzles place. I get it. I love it. I've been there. It's great. Roscoe's okay, I'll have a look. Fuck off. There's a reason why there's an hour and a half wait on a Sunday. Okay. How long you in town for a just a day. Maybe I'll be back though.

Speaker 3:          01:03:00       I'll be back over there right after the show. Maybe I'll go there for a little one on Gower. Okay. Ooh Man. It's good. All right. Maybe I'll try that. It's so good. And it's also one of those places. It's been there forever. We used to get it. I found out about it from 19 1994 when I was doing news radio. 95 ish, I guess. Have you been in La since you left the Massachusetts? No, I went to New York for a couple of years then I moved down here, moved down here in [inaudible] 94 okay, so you've been here a long time. Yeah. And when I was on news radio, they got it for like, you can order lunch and someone ordered Roscoe's chicken and I was like, what is this like waffles? And it was just like you waffles and chicken there. It looks that's, that's, that's doesn't look as good as it looks when you're there. When you're there and you smell it. It's damn good doing a, Roscoe is commercial here but an incredible, I'm a fan. That's an incredible combination of items.

Speaker 3:          01:03:49       It's so good. And afterwards you better have nothing to do man. Food Coma Son. Anyway, how do we get to that? W W I dunno fry, you may lose syrup stories going to different countries, different countries in opening your mind. So you read it. Yeah. So you are counteracting my resin flavored white wine with these maple syrup syrup. Well, I'm a, I'm a giant fan of spicy food. I love spicy foods. I really, really enjoyed Thailand. Uh, I really enjoyed their style of cooking and they're kind of food and it's just one of those people who, who eats those Scofield units on the, uh, on the hot peppers. Like, you know like how hot, you know? No, I just like spicy, not high hot and they're like Habanero. I liked it. I like put, it's pretty spicy compared to the average person, but I have friends that put me to shame.

Speaker 3:          01:04:39       Yeah, like a, I have a buddy of mine from that I used to do for your factor with my friend Tommy Hirsch. Go shout out to Tommy and I used to eat. I ate chili with him and I couldn't feel how hard he can go. I'm like, this is crazy. Yes. I think people just have a different inherent like it's almost like built into their bodies both. I think it's both. Some people are better able, it's like some are faster runners than others, but it's also training so you get to, you eat alone, you slowly work your way up to being able to tolerate. Unlike those really super hot peppers. I, I find it a very unpleasant, I have a friend just like you who really is into it, like really seeks out the hotness. I also think it's a bit like addiction,

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       like you tolerate like, like as you get used to like the less hot stuff, now you need more and more stuff in order to get the same. It's not exactly, some people think it's a high by the way, but there's a little high to it. Some people say that I, I mean, I, again, it's not for me. I cook meat with Jalapenos. I slice it up and I'll have like a piece of the meat with the Jalapenos to get, especially elk with Jalapenos and sensational. So good. Yes. Yeah. But my kids always make fun of me because I'm bald. So my whole head is covered with sweat and they'd come over and wipe my hands like, you're so gross. And then how old are your kids? The youngest ones are eight and 10. And you have, you have, uh, how many? Three. I have three daughters.

Speaker 2:          01:06:00       All daughters, two year old, a 10 year old and an eight. You'll live longer, uh, with daughters. If you, if you, if you plot, uh, Dad's survival on the y axis and fraction of female children on the x axis, a survival is slightly longer for men who have higher fraction of daughters, his children because boys drive you to your fucking grave cause they're so goddamn crazy. There's lots of theories as to why it happens. But I think, and that is in fact one of them, it's framed a bit more scientifically. Well by, it's the basic theory. My 10 year old is a maniac, my 10 year old daughters. And I just imagine if she was a boy, I'd be terrified that she knows just lighting things on fire. Blowing up buildings. Yes. Yeah. Boys are a problem. That can be, I mean, I think, yeah, I mean I think, um, you know, I think it's, um, I think, um, well, I mean we could get onto the whole gender issue.

Speaker 2:          01:06:53       I'm not sure we want to, but I think boys are responsible. It, let's talk about chimpanzees. It's easier. Okay. Mail chimp's a do most of the violence, but 95% of the violence in murders are committed by male chimpanzees. And most of the victims are males. And um, you know, I think it's, there's no doubt that, um, biology plays a very important role in male proclivity to violence, for example. So instead of trouble. Yeah. So the boys can be a problem that way. And Yeah, and I think the many ways in which s a society are of cultural traits that we invent, their purpose is to shape and guide those tendencies to violence to kind of mitigate them. But we don't just need, again, going back to the books or observe, please do. We don't just need, uh, we don't just use culture for that purpose.

Speaker 2:          01:07:41       There are, there's an argument in the book that we humans have, have domesticated ourselves. So if you look at, if you compare a dogs to wolves and domesticated cats to wild cats from which they descended, or a Guinea pigs to the wild Guinea pigs from which they descended or, or horses to, uh, to the wild horses, to which they sent a few again and again, you compare these couplets, these pears, you find that the domesticated version of these animals that are much more placid, much more peaceful, they also tend to have floppy ears. They have for, so Guinea pigs and dogs and cows all have splotchy black, white and Brown for why is that? The animals from which they evolved didn't have those, the kind of splotchiness. So, uh, and they become much more peaceful if you compare a human beings and, but they had a, uh, the, the, those animals were domesticated by humans.

Speaker 2:          01:08:36       Like I deliberately allowed the reproduction of this member of the litter and not that member because this member was, was, was nicer. And so across time we evolve a more a domesticated version of the ancestral species. So we get, we get my miniature Dachsund from a wolf, like the wound, like the kind of things that were photographed out in your studio here. Crazy transition. Uh, now if you look at humans and you compare us to, uh, to the, the non to our ancestors or to other primates for all the world, it looks like we have been domesticated. We are more peaceful and placid. We have sex outside. Non Reproductive sex is another thing. So these domesticated animals we'll have sex, uh, even when it's not time to reproduce. Uh, we, uh, we, um, uh, we, our tails, we don't have tails anymore, but our tails have get shortened.

Speaker 2:          01:09:31       There are all these features that we have, these, these behavioral qualities and these physical properties that we have are, are we get a feminization of our faces. Our jaws become smaller. Like if you look at, you compare these domesticated animals to their non domesticated ancestors, the domestic version are less violence. So we lose a lot of the traits that physical and, and, uh, um, psychological traits associated with violence. But there was no one that domesticated us. So the theory is, the question is how, how did that happen? And one of the theories that's discussed in, in, uh, in blueprint and that's advanced by other scientists, this is not my work, is that we self domesticated. And that what happened over the centuries, over the millennia, over millions of years, is that weaker individuals into our groups. When one individual became too autocratic and too violent and too powerful, they banded together and kill that guy.

Speaker 2:          01:10:29       And so over time we were killing the more violent members of our species, weeding out those people, and therefore the gene pool changed across time. And we self domesticated. We are more peaceful today than we would have been because we domesticated ourselves. And this is one of the arguments that's also made to help explain the origins of goodness actually, and the origins of cooperation because it would take a few good diesel to kill the bad person that's running everything that's evil. Correct. It's exactly right. Recreational sex does occur in Bonobos, which is really weird, isn't it? Because they're so similar to regular chimps. Yes, but they're not the same species. They also have homosexual sex. Uh, they use sex to make, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       so, uh, it, it's, yeah, they're very licentious a species. That's exactly right. And, and, and, and Bonobos are felt to be a self domesticated chimpanzee. So the similar, so bonobos are to chimps as uh, as let's say dogs are to wolves and, but there was the dogs, we domesticate it. The Banabos self domesticated as the theory. Do they know why or how? Well, the theory is that they did it. Like we were saying by weeding out killing the more of aggressive members it was, what we know must have happened is that the nicer guys must have been able to have more offspring. So the gene pool changed over time because of the differential success of the, of the, of the nicer guys. Now people have looked at this even in human societies, they've looked, for instance, there's a study I talk about in the book of different pathways to reproductive success amongst that Samani which is a group in Amazonia and other societies are similar.

Speaker 3:          01:12:10       So you can either be like big and strong or you can be charismatic and have useful knowledge in both ways. You have more children. Mm. Um, so there are these competing ways, uh, in our species of enhancing your reproductive fitness. Are you aware of [inaudible] work with, um, baboons? That's a fascinating case, right? Because they were studying baboons in Africa. They would eat from human garbage, and a bunch of them got sick and died. And it turns out that the most violent and ruthless of them got sick and died. And it changed the entire culture of the baboons tribe. I don't know that story. That's an interesting one. Little sterling grooming each other and being kind to each other. Oh my God. Yeah. That's a good example. But there was an accidental, it was an accident is an accident. And you had, it lasted for generations.

Speaker 3:          01:13:02       Yes. And when he returned to study them, he found that they were still this different kind of contrite about this a little bit. Yeah. I'm doing a shitty job. I'm sure I'm explaining it, but I'm, I know, I think could have the fascinate. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. He's very impressive. And a, I know the, I, I, I'm, uh, now that you're reminding me, I'm a little familiar with that particular study. I did know that it started with garbage, however, that Janet, it was a coincidental x extermination of the more violent members of the troop. Yes. Yeah. So they were removed from the gene pool and it changed the entire culture to the point where generations later they were still using this more peaceful ways. Full. Yeah, yeah, yeah. More kind. Well, it didn't just change the culture. It may have changed the culture, but it appears we're arguing the two of changing gene pool, second evolutionary pressure that's been applied.

Speaker 3:          01:13:51       So you have, you know, big dogs and small dogs. You don't allow the big ones to reproduce. You just reproduce the small ones. Yeah. You get small dogs in the end. Well, I've had dogs my whole life. And one of the things that you do kind of, I right now have a golden retriever. Uh, we have, uh, we, yeah, we have a white lab. Yeah. A yellow lab. And, uh, I've had a bunch of different dogs. Mastiffs and pit bulls and German shepherds, no small, we have a docksin too. You don't have small dogs. My oldest daughter has a tiny Chihuahua. It's a pays off. Sorry that he's the best. They just bark all the time now. He doesn't bark that much. He barks a little bit, but he's, he's really smart and he's actually a Mutt. He's Chihuahua and Australian shepherd, but he's like that big, it's tiny, tiny little thing and he's the best.

Speaker 3:          01:14:31       But um, um, my point being is that you can see if you get a dog from a breeder, you really can see how they can cultivate certain types of behavior. Like a good example of my mass tiff who passed away this year, he came from this guy who bred dogs for films and for a police training. And uh, he was the most calm, most chilled out dog I've ever had in my life. He was a giant dog. He's 140 pounds, but he, you could have them take him anywhere and trust him with a baby. And he was like, hello. Like everything was like totally he but this guy purposely, anytime a dog showed any aggression towards people or any aggression towards dogs, he wouldn't let them breed. So how can anyone not hear the stories like that or no? Stories like that and not then also think that genes play a role in human behavior.

Speaker 3:          01:15:21       You have children. Yes. You realize when you have children you see it like, okay, this is not, I didn't do this. This is, this comes from me. Yes. There's certain traits that my children have that I watch and I go, okay, this is not, this is teach them. They just started, they were born, this is what got my fucked up brain. You know, there's something in there. They're not seeing that. Like they don't see how crazy I am in terms of like how hard I work, things, how obsessive I get with things they're just doing and it's very weird. It's very weird because you see, oh well, okay, well how much of this shit that's in me is like how much of me is me deciding to be this person and how much of me has no choice? About half and half. I would say. Overall on average across traits, how much do you think gets passed down through genetics in terms of inclinations?

Speaker 3:          01:16:13       Like like the nature of physicians? Yeah, about half on average. So for example, about half the Wii, you know how religious you are or how risk averse you are. Like I can, I can about half the variation in how if you look at a group of people and some are more risk averse than others, about about half of that has to do with their jeans and half has to do with how they were raised or what environments they grew up in. So you know, there's a kind of innateness to many of our qualities and you can shape them. You know, for example, you can't, you couldn't make me a musician. Unfortunately I have almost no musical talent. I can dance I think. I mean, I think others would even say that I can do that. Uh, but um, does not just like, I think I can dance, but I can't. Uh, but I, I have no musical ability whatsoever. I would say I'm tone deaf and, and you know, I can appreciate music I like, but I can't produce it. There's no way you could train me, I don't think to be a musician. Um, but, um, so some of it is inborn and some of it is, is a,

Speaker 2:          01:17:09       is taught for all of these qualities. Yes. It's a fascinating thing to watch it emerge from a child, isn't it? Yes. As a parent you see where it comes from. Although we have adopted, like, I, um, my mother had three biological children and I have two adopted siblings that come from actually a multiracial family. I have a black sister and a Chinese brother. And My mother was an incredible human being. She died when I was a 25. She was 47. Uh, and, uh, we have been foster parents, my wife and I, and, and so, and might, we have lots of adopted kids in the extended family in addition to biological kids. And so you can see, you can see the play of genes. You could see the extent to which the, the, the kind of inherited traits that these people that we all have. And you'll see the shaping by how you're raised and you know, so both are important.

Speaker 2:          01:17:59       And this is incidentally why if you ever have anyone, it's not, it's not nature or nurture. It's both always almost in every single trait actually. Well that's the case of so many things in this life. We want everything to be binaries. Yes. It's, it's nuts. It's a total, we were talking earlier, it's a total loss of nuance and an inability to see any gray and, and, and some people think, and I think that's what you were talking about, some people think that we are hardwired to like dichotomies to see, you know, male and female and an up and down and good and evil and left and right. And to simplify the world by finding it. And that we like it, that it soothing to us to think that the world can be divided into two categories, but in fact, many times not always like up and down is sort of clear, but many times it can't.

Speaker 2:          01:18:51       They're shades of gray and it's harder. That's harder to live in the gray. Yes. I completely agree. And that's why I've always been a po. I mean, I think it's an incredibly foolish to deny that, but people find comfort in denying they find comfort in main tribal. You find confidence in them. Yeah. US versus them. This is the classic. Yes, yes, yes. It's, it's a, it's a simplified view of the world and it's, it's foolish and dangerous actually. Yeah. Um, now sometimes you're at war with an enemy, you know, it's me or him and uh, or us or them, there are circumstances in which it's a different survival. Yes. Or survival in that mode. Yeah. I get it. But, um, but you know, but I think the a kind of worldview which says we are good, they are evil. Um, as we've been saying in different kind of ways in different parts of our conversation is I think foolish and wrong and ultimately self-injurious. Actually. Um, so we used to have a, you know, you've done martial arts, I spent years training and showed ICAN karate. It's very traditional Japanese style, which I loved. I'm sure you've had the same thing. You actually are grateful for your up to your opponent. You Mount your opponent, you say thank you to your opponent, right? Sure. Component is necessary for

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       you to learn. Oh yeah. I mean this is the whole point, not just your opponent training partners. You don't want people to be able to beat you. Yes. You get better. That's exactly right. So, um, so this is, you know, I think that the kind of, that aspect of that kind of training is, um, is a life lesson as well, right? The capacity to see that in the same happens with ideas. How to my ideas get better. How do I discover in my laboratory new knowledge I discovered against opposition, right? Someone says, you're wrong about that. It's not true. And I'm like, Oh yeah, let me prove it to you. Here's what, I'm going to go back and do more experiments and come back to you with more arguments and more data and show you that actually I'm right about this or not. You go back to your lab and you're like, oh shit, they were right.

Speaker 3:          01:20:52       We were wrong. So that's the way you uncover truth, right? It's the way you get to bore perfection. It's the kind of ying and Yang actually. So, uh, so, so yes, I think that, um, I think that this, this, this, this, the simplification of the world, um, to think of, you know, I'm good and your evil is, um, really misunderstands that in many, not all, but in many circumstances and misunderstands what's happening. And also it brings back this problem that human beings have always had with ego and this need to be right. And that identifying yourself in each individual discussion and debate and battle and needing to triumph. And even though you desire to be correct, you have to understand when you are not. And you have to appreciate someone who shows you that you are incorrect because they are allowing you to grow your nest, a finished product. There's no way you can be. Yes. I think that's why I like arguing with people I disagree with because that's when I learned more stuff. Right. If I talk to people I agree with, I don't learn as much. So you get together with our private roads do that dude. And some other dudes I have saw is I just came from his house and uh, he also, he's crazy. But anyway,

Speaker 5:          01:22:04       he'll laugh. He will listen to this and this and he'll be laughing right now. Does he do for a living? He's a financier. No fucking way. God Damn. That's cliche. Yes, exactly. That's hilarious. Is

Speaker 3:          01:22:18       So, um, it is hilarious. Anyway, pro gun mercenary.

Speaker 5:          01:22:23       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:22:25       Fries. Yeah, we saw that coming. That's really funny. The um, oh, what was the hold on I was going to say something to you about you arguing with people you disagree with. Um, hold on. I lost the train of thought. I had said before we talked about my friend. Uh, you learn from them. Anyway. I lost the train there, but no worries. Yeah. Um, so, uh, yeah, I mean that's, that's another issue that I've faced with this podcast where people get upset at me for having people on that have opinions that they disagree with. That's nuts. Yeah. They think that you, you're, you're doing a disservice by providing a platform that's not that, that's phrase they keep saying platform, giving them a platform. I think you have power, uh, which you should use wisely. I have power. I should use, like we all have some power and some parts of our lives and I think it is okay to say you have some power.

Speaker 3:          01:23:16       You do. You know, you have lots of millions of listeners, people respect you. Um, lots of people are both presidents, CEOs, they're people of power. But the idea that by talking to someone, you are somehow abusing that power. That's, that's crazy to me. In fact, quite the opposite. I think that you are shining bright light of day onto a ideas. Let people discuss them. Look, let's, it's also quite schizophrenia. I mean, have you ever seen one, the schizophrenia person draws these, uh, connections where they have one person and that person met this other person and that person used to work with this other person and that person met Hitler. Yeah. So, you know, Hitler, yes. Know you've ever seen those. And yes, it's really similar in the same sort of a way. It's this weird sort of a thing where you're not allowed to even communicate or be in contact with someone who is in this apoe. And it's a myth. It's, it's very childlike. Yes. This, this perspective. And it's very by an area and my friend in your Susie's friend. Exactly. So fucking stupid. Yes. I would agree with that. And it's a, it's a really common thing today that you, you're seeing people are trying to reinforce this idea in and push it on other folks. Well, I think one thing, you know, like I think,

Speaker 2:          01:24:29       um, I think that, um, like we were talking about, I think that exposing ourselves to a breadth of ideas to people we disagree with. I, you know, I think and, and creating an environment in which people can express themselves. Um, you know, it is good. You're not going to get any arguments from me against on that, on that point.

Speaker 3:          01:24:49       No. Um, and I, I just think it's better for everybody. Like we were talking about before, when you meet someone who can give you a lesson and, and express something in a way that makes you reconsider your own ideas that you hold sacred. I mean, I'll give you an example. Apple,

Speaker 2:          01:25:05       when I, when I, I met my wife 30 years ago, I, I wasn't pro death penalty, but I was, I would say I would say have neutral to the death penalty. I would be like, you know, ted Bundy, the state can put him to death and I had all the kind of conventional reasons or I didn't really care. He's a vile person. He killed all these people. He tortured them. If the families will get any relief or whatever, that's fine. I had some concerns because I was this statistician about a conviction of the innocent and I support the innocence project and I am very concerned with police brutality. I have for years been advocating the racializing, the police brutality is vile and, and uh, uh, port and must be firmly resisted. Uh, I think that, um, I think the, the, the prosecutorial misconduct way people are prosecutors lie and put people in prison.

Speaker 2:          01:25:56       Uh, you know, there've been many, many cases of people on death row who were innocent that should offend our conscience. So even back then I had some concerns about the death penalty because I, um, because I, I recognize that, you know, we can't be perfect. We're going to convict some innocent people and also let some guilty people go free. That's not as bad as killing the putting to death. He innocent, but they're both bad. So I had that concern about the death penalty, but otherwise I was like, it's okay. My opinions have totally changed. I'm completely opposed to the death penalty now for many reasons. Not just the statistical reason, but also I think it's immoral. I don't think the state should put into, I think we can rip deprive you of liberty. I think we can make sure you're not a threat to society.

Speaker 2:          01:26:37       We can block you up for the rest of your life. But I think we, the state should not be taking people's lives in that way. There's something extraordinarily strange about locking someone up. It's very strange. Well, we have a carceral state. I mean, you know, we lock up a higher we have is, we are fraction of people incarcerated I think is the same as Stalinist Russia and we have very long prison sentences, which are nuts. You don't need them for deterrence, for nonviolent drug, especially for non all nonviolent offenses should have much shorter prison doesn't, we should have more. We should have higher certainty of punishment. Higher fraction of people who have actually committed crimes should be punished. But I think we should, we could cut in half or less the, the duration of the census. I think you'll be able to, uh, deter criminals from doing things with a three month sentence if they are very confident that they will be convicted if they're caught.

Speaker 2:          01:27:27       Whereas now we have a system where most are not convicted like this Jesse smallest thing, which is just ridiculous in the news. And, uh, uh, and which therefore the, and only a tiny fraction are convicted and, but they're giving huge lung sentences. It's like they're paying the sentence for everyone that didn't, it doesn't make any sense. And it, it's expensive at ties up our prison system. Actually, can I go to tell you the story? True. So it was a situation a few years ago when there's a very famous, um, uh, director and writer by the name of David Simon, who I consider a friend. He did the wire, he was a show runner for a bunch of other very famous, uh, wonderful, uh, TV programs. Now he started his career actually as a reporter in a, in Baltimore. He was a beat reporter and then went on to become a writer, did the wire and so forth.

Speaker 2:          01:28:16       And he told the story, uh, actually at Yale to students about how he had just come back from a summit. President Obama was still president where he was trying to help the students to see that you could find common ground with your political opponents and that you need to listen to them and talk to them in order to, to find that ground, uh, if, and so he told the following story, he said, I had, I just came back from Camp David where, uh, there was a meeting about how to reduce incarceration in our society. And he said the Koch brothers were there and the students all hissed and Newt Gingrich was there and the students, all hissed and a bunch of liberal people were there. And the students were really happy about that. And then they said, well, why did you go, how could you associate yourself with those evil people? And he said, look, you said

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       the, the conservatives want to reduce incarceration because it's expensive. The liberals want to reduce incarceration because it's unjust. And the libertarians want to reduce incarceration because the state shouldn't be depriving people of Liberty. And I can find common ground with these people and reduce incarceration. Why would I not talk to them? And the students didn't seem to understand that. They were like, they couldn't get it. That's why they shouldn't be able to vote to be 33, 25. I mean, and so I don't know how we got onto this, you know, like talking to you is so much fun because it's like we're all over the place. But, um, how did I get it? Come up with this example we were talking about talking to her political enemies. Was it or something else? We're talking about people telling you that you shouldn't associate yes. People that have varying opinions.

Speaker 3:          01:29:49       Yes, yes. And you know, Oh and no. We were talking about an incarceration and prison sensors and so forth. So we have a horrible problem in our society with, with incarceration. A larger fraction of our populace is incarcerated. We deprive after you paid your debt to society, we often have these, these, uh, we deprive you of your right to vote, which I think is wrong. You've paid your debt to society. You should be able to reenter society. That's exactly, yes. Exactly. You were in prison for 10 years. That's enough. You don't, now you, we want you to feel a part of society. Can we want to welcome you back if we have that vision of justice? How about the registered sex offender? That's a serious problem. Especially for, uh, crimes. You know, the, these crazy cases which offend my conscience. I know a guy who got charged as a registered sex offender because he urinated outside.

Speaker 3:          01:30:37       Yeah. That's not caught in the south urinating outside. That's nuts. That's just a prosecutorial abuse. Or you know, you have these Romeo and Juliet laws, which are not in every state now. Thank God, alas, last, they are not in every state. Uh, you know, you have a 16 year old boy and a 14 year old girl. There have to be exceptions for that kind of sexual practice. You know, they're exchanging a sexually explicit images. They should not be considered sex offenders for the rest of their lives. That's nuts. So, um, so yeah, so all of those things. So the, but the problem is not only do we have a huge fraction of people in prison, we have extremely long prison sentences compared to any many European countries for the same crime and a, it's costly. It's unjust, it's ineffective. I think. I think we should change the policies on this and maybe we will.

Speaker 3:          01:31:24       There's also the idea of reforming them. It's, it's, they're not using all the tools within their disposal. They're not really giving a good attempted it. And I just don't think it does anything other than make their life hell for a short period of time, which we're hoping we hope deters them from doing future crime. Well, they're different. There's the justice, there's deterrent there. Safety, right? Like so violent criminals that we put in jail. Uh, we need to do that. I mean, I'm not interested in being killed by somebody who, you know, could it killed someone else. She should have busy in jail, uh, for a while, 20 years. So I'm at a time from larder.

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       Yeah, for murder. I think 20 years is enough. Well, a European, a European standards are about 20 years actually. And there are different things like if you want to deprive them, if your, if your vision is they're being punished for the killing of a life, therefore they've surrendered their life. It's sort of eye for an eye kind of justice. You would, they would be the rest of their lives. And you know, I, we can debate whether that's reasonable or not. If you, if you want to provide a public safety reason, people often age out of their violence. So a lot of men, typically these were talking mostly about men who do these things. Uh, you know, by the time they're in their forties or 50s, they're much less violent to stoss declines. They get older and wiser. Uh, they're not interested in, in criminal, in that kind of criminal behavior.

Speaker 2:          01:32:44       Many of them are not. So that does, that suggests you don't need life sentences for murder. And I think it also depends and we have gradations of murder. You know, we have like the impulsive stuff that intent matters of planfulness matters, that depravity matters. All of these things are, are factors. And I don't think we should have a one size fits all incarceration for murder. Yes. That's my opinion. What do you think? I think it depends entirely on the circumstances. If two men are engaged in some sort of a dispute and one winds up killing the other one, that's a big difference between that and someone breaking into your house and killing your daughter. Yes. A correct. And I also think even in that, like I, I really am opposed to these stand your ground laws. I think those are, if you have the opportunity to avoid conflict and to avoid you or not, uh, it, I would prefer as a state to require that you walk away, even if it makes you feel embarrassed, uh, then give you the right to kill someone for offending you in those, those videos of the, of the guys in that shot, the guy on his knees in the parking lot in the, I forgot what state it was like, uh, not long.

Speaker 2:          01:33:48       A year or two ago. They got into an altercation and the parking lot. Like, if I have words with someone, an apartment shot guy on his knee. Yes. There was no threat to him. And he was, he was not prosecuted on the stand your ground argument, which is nuts. Why was the guy on his knees? He was, I forgot, I said, don't shoot me or something. Oh, Jesus. So it was, it was crazy. He didn't get prosecuted. I don't think so. We can look up the facts. There were several cases. There were several cases like this, but you know, like, I remember when I was doing, showed a con karate, my Sensei Kazumi Tabata, this was years ago, uh, the 30 years ago now. And he told us the following story. He, he said there was a Sensei in this village in Japan, and the students were coming to the Dojo.

Speaker 2:          01:34:30       And, uh, there was the, the, the best student that, you know, and then all the other students, and they were walking through the village and they passed the approach to horse that was on the street from the rear, and it startled the horse. And as the horse reared up and kicked its leg, the, the, uh, the best student instantly did a kind of a avoidance, kind of twisted his body and avoided the kick and the, and the, and the, uh, the horse, his leg went right in front of him and all the other students were amazed at his ability and they get to the Dojo and they tell the Sensei, this is my sensei telling me this story, telling all of us this story. And they, those students get to this, the Dojo. And they tell that the Sensei, the story marveling at the, at the ability of this master student to definitely avoid the strike and the Sensei's very angry and he don't understand why, why is he so angry?

Speaker 2:          01:35:19       He said, if he were a really good student of mine, he would have walked on the other side of the street. He would have avoided the horse altogether. So the real wisdom is to avoid avoidance of conflict in the first place. There's no reason to seek out conflict. And so on the stand your ground laws, you know, if the choices ether you just avoid the conflict, you know, someone, someone swore at you or called you an asshole or was an unreasonable jerk that doesn't give you the right to kill them. Right. Um, so anyway, I don't know how we got onto this as well.

Speaker 3:          01:35:52       How are we going to the penalty for, for murder. Exactly. Exactly. So, so, so different gradations. Yeah. Yeah. I just don't know how much of a deterrent it is locking people up. I just, I, I'm not sure, I'm not really sure if that actually stops people from doing things. I think it stops some people. I think there've been academic research on this. I just don't think there's any real rehabilitation other than personal choice. I mean, I think the, the, the real rehabilitation comes from someone making a personal choice to never be that person. That Dan again. Yes. For most of them you're, you're, you're being locked up with a bunch of hardened criminals and you, your, that's your, your community. But you're not suggesting we have a society in which when you commit violent acts, we do nothing. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. No, I'm, I'm suggesting you're struggling with this is what you're saying.

Speaker 3:          01:36:41       Yeah. The, yeah. The concept of nuances. Yes. This is, this is a applied here better than anywhere else. I think I got the impression looking at your face a moment ago when I told my sort of sweet Sensei, Japanese karate story, that you didn't agree necessarily. We know that's a very wise way of looking at it. Yeah. Don't, don't be near a fucking horse that wants a kick. You very smart. Yeah. Get out of there. I'm a big believer in avoiding conflict. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm the first guy to conflict, not intellectual conflict. Right, exactly. Physical words and violence are different access routes and very, extremely different. Yeah. I mean, intellectual conflict at that is actually important and you learn from it. Yes. Very rarely do you learn too much. Right. I mean, you learned don't do that again, that's going to learn from physical conflicts. This don't do that again. Yes. I was just, it's just, you know what, what happens in nature with animals happens with people. If you let them get to that level and it's scratched down to the, you know, remove that thin film of society with rocks. Yes, there we are violent. But I keep coming back to what I argue in blueprint. You know, we, I have those, those

Speaker 2:          01:37:44       tendencies, but equally we have tendencies to be kind and friendly and uh, and it's, we have to create the environment to, uh, to foster those. I have a, there's sense in which, and I talk about this in the book, there's a sense in which as we create those environments, we actually change ourselves as a species. There's this a set of ideas that's known as gene culture coevolution. And the idea is that we create certain kinds of cultural environments, those kind of cultural environments advantage certain ones of us making those of us that are born with certain abilities better off, which then leads to those environments being created even more. Let me give you some, an example of that. The most famous example of this is something known as lactase persistence. So many people, not about half the world can adults can drink milk. The other half cannot.

Speaker 2:          01:38:36       They get lactose intolerant. Well, why can you drink milk as an adult? Have you ever thought about that? Like why? Why are you capable of drinking milk as an adult? In our ancestral state, actually up until about 10,000 years ago, only babies could address to digest milk because only babies had milk. Babies would suckle at their mother's breasts and have milk and then they'd be weaned and then they would never drink milk again. There'd be no milk to drink. There was therefore no reason for any adult to be able to digest lactose, which is the principle sugar in milk because there was no lactose in your diet. You didn't encounter milk, so human beings were able to digest lactose when they were babies. They lost that capacity. All human beings, when they got to about two or three or four or five, when they wean, they no longer were able to just melt.

Speaker 2:          01:39:19       So the enzymes in their body, we're programmed as it were to only work when they were infants. Well about between three and 9,000 years ago in multiple places in Africa and in Europe, human beings suddenly domesticate animals. We domesticate milk producing animals like cattle and sheep and goats and camels, and now all of a sudden there's a supply of milk around us because of our cultural innovation, because of the thing we invented, we created the domestic breeds. Now we have milk. Now therefore those among us who are mutants who were born with the ability to have our lactase, the enzyme that digest lactose persist into adulthood. This is known as lactase persistence. Those of us who had that would have a survival advantage because we could have another source of calories that the rest of the people in our group couldn't consume. They couldn't drink milk like we could and we had a source of unspoiled water during times of drought.

Speaker 2:          01:40:14       We could drink milk. Everyone else had to drink this filthy water that they didn't have access to, so those among us who had these qualities could reproduce better, survive headed, have survival advantage. It turns out that this has happened several times. This is when well documented. The genetics of this has all been worked out several times and last three to 9,000 years because of Acumen, cultural product. We have evolved to be a slightly different genetically and it doesn't stop with cows. I think that when we invent cities about over 5,000 years ago, we, so we, we, we invent agriculture about 10,000 years ago. It's debated exactly when we invent cities, but between five and 10,000 years ago we start having fixed settlements. Earlier you and I were talking about population density and having to live with other people, which is not our ancestral state, not packed, not with other people.

Speaker 2:          01:41:01       We always lived as a group, as socially. I think that as we invent cities, people with different kinds of brains are better able to survive in cities. So now that we've invented cities where advantaging people with certain kinds of brains and therefore I think in a thousand or 2000 or 5,000 years, just like the milk example, there'll be different people as a result of something we humans manufactured that we made. And I could keep giving you examples of this. There's a, in the book, I have an example, another example of a, they're called the sea nomads. They, they live in the Philippines. These are people who don't live on land. They live on houseboats that sail around the Pacific for thousands of years. They've had this lifestyle and they die for their food dive. So they forage on the seabed. They are the world's best free divers.

Speaker 2:          01:41:48       They spend hours per day underwater. They can hold their breath longer than anyone else. Uh, and they, they do do it. Nothing except with weights and wooden goggles. They dive down into the seabed and forage and they hunt. They hunt underwater with spears. Okay. They hunt underwater would spirits. It's mind boggling. Wow. And uh, but they, uh, have evolved, have different spleens and different oxygen metabolism than you and I. So those, among them that could survive the dives, fed their families, made more babies. And now we think this happened 2000 years ago. There are different, the ones that couldn't died. So their invention of a seafaring way of life, their invention of a way of living at sea, the boats technology, the, the spear fishing technology, the intervention of those technologies creates an environment, cultural environment around them, which modifies natural selection and changes the kind of genes that those people have.

Speaker 2:          01:42:49       These are, these are discussed in blueprint and there are many examples of how I want to see an image of these goggles. Yeah. If you Google, if you Google, um, that's our little slit goggles. If you Google see nomad Goggle, you may come up with it and let me give you, what are they using for a lens? There's no lens. Yeah, they're little slits. So what's the point? Uh, I didn't look at the technology at that level, but let me just find lens than it doesn't protect your eyes. I think it, I think it, uh, it may reduce glare underwater, you know, by having you look through slits, it's got some something on, I can see it, Huh? Uh, well, no, because they didn't have glass or maybe they might take a piece of it. Well, the one this kids holding up, it's got something. Let me see.

Speaker 2:          01:43:35       That's a lots of actual, no, that's a modern scuba diving mask. Yeah. He may have made it from wood, but the ancient one. Yeah. This is the Zhao. But uh, so if you look at, so look at that. Can you find what's I'm looking Goggle, I mean it'll be hard to find. Maybe no one's put it on and now of course they have modern technology so they can uh, they can, uh, that's, those are totally monitored plastic. Yes. But they used to have these wooden goggles anyway. They adopted or adapted rather to this new lifestyle. Sort of like genetically adapt. Yes. Like the [inaudible] have developed disability to not get frostbite and to not get numb fingers and cold weather. I did not know that example, but that would be an example of that. Yeah. This is an example from a, believe they were talking about it from Alaska that they, they did genetic testing on these people and they did different facets.

Speaker 2:          01:44:27       Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. That would be another example of just exactly that example. I didn't put that one in the book, but yes. Yeah, we're incredibly flexible, right? Yes. Well we have flex two kinds of flexibility, so, so think about, think about like when we settled the Tibetan plateau, when human being settled, the Tibetan plateau, there were different challenges up there. It's cold up there and there's not a lot of oxygen up there. Now we could, genetic evolution is not fast in us. We didn't become furry, you know, like one way to cope with a cold is to become furry again. We didn't do that. Why? Because we had clothing. We had cultural means of coping with this situation. So for the coal to cope with a cold, we used culture. There was no cultural means to cope with the low oxygen up there. They didn't have bottled oxygen 5,000 years ago.

Speaker 2:          01:45:15       There was no way to produce oxygen. They couldn't, they didn't have the chemistry to produce auction. So the auction to cope with the low oxygen tent pressure up there, low oxygen tension up there. They've evolved genetically so that the people who live in the, in the Himalayas, they actually have different kinds of hemoglobin compared to you and me, better able to extract oxygen from the environment. So they're two different challenges that are coped with in different ways. One is cope with culturally by cultural evolution. One is coped with genetically, which is much slower, which genetic evolution and it's the cultural evolution is the cultural traits that natural. So natural selection equips us with a capacity to accumulate knowledge and to teach each other stuff. And given that rare ability, as we discussed earlier, we're able to spread out across the planet and live in all these dissimilar environments.

Speaker 2:          01:46:04       We use our cultural ability to dominate the planet basically. Now, when you were, when you were creating this, will you actually thinking of it as a blueprint that someone would follow? Uh, yes and no. I wasn't thinking of it that way, but having finished the book, I do think that there are, like I don't, in the book I talk a little bit in the book about implications for, uh, of these ideas for, for artificial intelligence. Like, as we create robots, uh, as we, even as we create sex robots or autonomous vehicles or, uh, forms of bots online, how should those bots be programs so as not to injure our society. So there are some policy implications I discuss in the book, but I, I wasn't thinking of this as a, as a, as a, as a a prescription. Like this is the way to live a good life.

Speaker 2:          01:46:54       But partly because as I, as I argue in the book, you know, we don't need to affirmatively seek a good life. We have been endowed by natural selection with the capacity to make a good life, uh, full of these qualities. So this blueprint is, I want to use the word God given it doesn't come from God, but it's God given, you know, it comes from somewhere else. It comes from natural selection that we, um, that we do this. So I, yeah. How much time have you put into artificial intelligence and a lot, and we do a lot of work in my lab on Ai. What about sex robots? Like what rules should they give for sex robots? And how much could that damage interpersonal relations? Yes, that's a great question. That's exactly the right question in my view. So our concern with sex robots from a liberty point of view should not in the slightest.

Speaker 2:          01:47:43       B, whether you enjoy a sex robot, it's your business you'd buyer bought, do what you want. I really don't. I see. I find it would be hard pressed to to object. The problem is with set. Well let's, let's back up from the less provocative, but let's come back at six but I looked like a simpler example. First let's talk. Let's talk about your children talking to Alexa. Okay, so the person who designs Alexa wants to make your child's experience easy and pleasant and as part of the programming of Alexa because they want to make Alexa the obedient servant of your child, it doesn't require a child to say, please Alexa, would you play the music for me? Your child can be as rude as she wants to. Alexa and Alexa will do what she wants. What you should be concerned about, however, is not your child's interaction with Alexa.

Speaker 2:          01:48:26       When you should be concerned about is what your child is learning from interacting with Alexa, that then she takes to the playground. So now she's rude to other children. So Alexa is corroding our social fabric. Alexa, in this example is making children rude to each other. So our concern is not so much do we make and do we make, you know, like Asimov's laws of robotics, do we we, it's not that we want to program the robot so that their don't harm you. It's true. The first law, we don't want the robot to through an act of commission or omission harmer allow human to come to be harmed. It's that we're concerned about how the robot and interacting with you might cause you to harm others. The robot, the robotic intelligence creates these externalities, these cascade effects. So in the Alexa example, we might want to regulate the programming of devices that speak to children, not because we want to deprive your daughter, have the right to speak how she wants, but because we recognize that that robot is going to cause your daughter to be rude to other people.

Speaker 2:          01:49:29       Is it really? Do you really think, yes, the Alexa, what's the weather that that would make your attorney? But surely I think it will contribute. So that's a, it's an example. It's not like, I'm not arguing that Alexis should become, or nately think it's so novel to kids that they know it's not a person. I don't think it really, all right. But we're using these examples to build the thing. So let's talk about the sex robot. Okay. So some people believe that actually the emergence of sex robots, which will surely appear in the next 10 or 20 years, um, will, um, will be a fantastic boon. They think that, um, you will people be able to experiment, uh, you'll be able to experiment with same sex relationships. For example, a group sex. Uh, you might learn to be a, a better lover so he could practice with the robots and therefore you'd be more experienced when you were having sex with a real human.

Speaker 2:          01:50:21       So they, you can't get venereal diseases from a sex robots. You can't hurt their feelings. Uh, so people think that the argument based on ethical grounds is that this would be terrific. Uh, that this will be a benefit. Other people have the opposite opinion. Other people think that actually having sex with robots first of all is symbolically and, and, um, conceptually vile. They think that, you know, it, it, it, it takes sex and converts it into a kind of a machine, literally a machine like a, you know, function. Uh, and they furthermore think that it would result in, you ha in one having a kind of anonymous or impersonal interactions with human subsequently that you'll be in trained, you know, to let's say want an obedient, uh, you know, partner, uh, for example, I don't have a stand on this. Like I don't know which way it's going out.

Speaker 2:          01:51:07       And in a way I don't have to get, make a stand on it. Because what I'm interested in recognizing is that when we talk about having, allowing people to have sex with sex robots not allowing there, it's going to happen. The focus of our concern should be not what is your experience in your bedroom when you have sex with a sex robot? Our concern is a state like my interest, I have no stake or control over what you're doing over there, but my interest is in, in once you have had that experience, how does that change how you interact with other people? Right. And there I think just like anything else like you can, you can make all the garbage you want in your house, but if you start polluting the environment, you're harming me. So now I have a reason for intervening in your activities on your land. You can't pollute your own land if that pollution runs off onto my land. And so the similar argument can be made or look at autonomous vehicles. Here's an example.

Speaker 2:          01:52:01       Right now we have all roads, almost all roads have just human drivers and in 20 or 30 years almost all roads will probably have only nonhuman drivers. Machines will drive and those autonomous vehicles probably can be yoked together. They can communicate with each other so that you'll have like, like trains of cars moving and synchrony. Like each of them will be communicating with the other nearby cars and you'll have laminar flow where all these vehicles are smoothly moving and joining the highway and leaving the highway and communicating on a citywide scale, slowing traffic down miles away because they anticipate with AI that there'll be a jam here if they don't do that. And, and I think that'll be actually great. I'm actually looking forward to autonomous. I mean I still like to take my car to the speedway but you know, dried it itself with stick, which I like, but you know, but in between we're going to have a world of what I call hybrid systems of human driven cars and autonomous vehicles coexisting in an on a plane, on an even plane.

Speaker 2:          01:53:00       And we need to be worried about that because these autonomous vehicles when we interact with them are going to change how we interact with each other. For example, do we program the autonomous vehicle to drive at a constant steady speed? If you're the designer of the car, you might say, Gee, I don't want this car to crash a, I want the car to drive in a very predictable fashion and that that's what's best for the occupants of the car. That's what's gonna allow me to sell more vehicles. But it may be the case that actually when people are in contact with such a vehicle, they get lulled into a false sense of security. Oh, that'd vehicle never does anything new. I don't need to pay so much attention to the car in front of me. I just miss drive, you know, at a steady clip.

Speaker 2:          01:53:43       And then they veer off and they go to a part of the highway where they're just human drivers and now having been lulled into a false sense of security, they cause more collisions is not paying attention. So that autonomous vehicle has changed how I drive in a way that harms other people. So maybe the programming of the vehicle should be to occasionally do erratic things too. Like suddenly slow down or speed up a little bit, obliging me to stay vigilant and pay attention as I'm interacting with that car. So that then when I go to another part of the highway, when I interact with just humans, I have retained that vigilance. Once again, the lesson here is, is that it's not just about the one on one interaction between the robotic artificial intelligence and the human being. It's about how the robot's affect us. And in my lab, we do many experiments in social systems where we take a group of people and we drop online, we drop a Bot or in the laboratory we have a physical robot and we watch how the presence of the robot doesn't just modify how the human interacts with the robot, but how the humans interact with each other.

Speaker 2:          01:54:45       So if we put a robot right, they're looking at us with its third, I would, we, uh, you know, would it change how you and I talked to each other, make us different. That's the experiments we're doing. Well, clearly in the sex robot realm, that's going to be a problem. I mean we, we see the difference between humans that have porn addictions. Yeah, that's a good example. Yeah. Porn addictions when people do they developed is very impersonal way of communicating with people and they, they think about sex and the objectification of the opposite sex in a very different reasons. Very different way. It flavors the way you, it flavors your expectations. Yes. Yes. And it makes it difficult. It can make it difficult for you to have normal sexual relationships if you come to see if your expectations are, are, uh, guided by porn and that is going to be radically magnified by some sort of artificial life form that you create

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       that's indistinguishable. Yes. Have, you can have an indistinguishable sex partner that is, you know, some incredibly beautiful woman. Yes. That is a robot. And then you are, man, let's go, man, women would be quite happy to change their spouses for robots. I wonder if women are going to be as intuit as men because I think women divine desire, more emotional intimacy and I think, I mean, uh, on a, on a scale than men do. I, I think, um, I think the jury is still out on, you know, what, what the relative balance between men and women, we might be surprised that uh, that will be repeated nails, especially given x societal expectations and women can form those and, and I'll be giving her a chance to not a lot of men can be sure. So it could go both ways. I don't, I'm not prepared to make a prediction who's going to be better off in the gender debate with the emergence of sex robots, but they'll maybe you way you suggest, I don't know what we're also in this weird transition genetically where they're doing genetic expert experiments on humans and with the advent of Crispr and emerging technologies, I was talking about that in the book too.

Speaker 3:          01:56:50       Entirely possible that there's not going to be any frumpy bodies anymore. That that's hundreds of years away. But yes, I think so. I wonder, I mean, I don't know if it is, I think if they start cracking them out in China and they start giving birth to eight foot tall superman, yes. 12 inch dicks. Yes. We're going to have a real issue. Yes. Uh, we will, uh, yes, that's the least of it. Uh, yes. Uh, like God, I mean it's a million tiredly possible in the future they're going to have that and then we're going to have likely cumins yes. I think that is likely the debate is how far in the future. So I don't think we're going to start by using these technologies to cure a monogenic diseases. So, you know, like thalassemia for example, so a diseases or certain immune deficiencies, disease where a single gene is defective and uh, and those will be the initial targets.

Speaker 3:          01:57:41       But once we start with that, eventually I think there will be people who will want to genetically engineer other people, uh, their offspring for example, and a modified them in the ways that you suggest, maybe not 12 inch Dick's but maybe you know, ability to run fast or something else. Far Smarter. I mean, yes. Isn't that one of these side effects that they showed with the, um, genetic manipulation of these Chinese babies to eliminate HIV there? That they made them smarter? No, I don't know if they made them smarter there. What's clear from the most recent findings I've seen from that case is that a, unsurprisingly, as anyone could predict, the technology is not good enough to restrict the mutations to one particular region of the genome. So there were other changes in the genome and these children that occurred elsewhere rather than the targeted region, which was to increase their immunity to HIV.

Speaker 3:          01:58:29       And we don't know what those are, but those could kill those kids quickly. We could make them better in some ways, we have no way of knowing yet, but I think the conclusion was that it increased their intelligence. I don't, I think it's, I have not seen results and I think it would be premature find that it would because every mature to come to that because they're [inaudible]. Yeah. There the problem is also sensational Click Bait, which is, that's what you want to click, you know, not just that they did the HIV and they made them smarter is going to get like 40% more clicks versus, yeah, wolf 40% yeah. That mean that's, that's just the nature of humans, right? Yes. Um, just declare clear. I talk about the crisper example in, in uh, in blueprint. I actually talk about these, how these technologies, again, my lens on it is how these technologies are going to change how we interact with each other.

Speaker 3:          01:59:16       And it goes back to the example we were talking about at the beginning when we invented cities. That was a technology that changed how we interacted with each other. So human beings for a very long time, they've been inventing when we invented weapons, that was a technology that changed how we interact with each other. So we have previously done this kind of thing. We've invented a technology that changed how we interact with each other and I'm very interested in in the and discuss some of those implications. Yeah. I'm incredibly interested in this because I, I love to study history and I love to study like how crazy the world was four thousand five thousand years ago, a thousand years ago, what it's going to be like in the future. I just think our understanding of the consequences of our actions are so different than anybody has ever had before. We have just such a, a broader, first of all, we have examples from all over the world now that we can study very closely, which I don't think really was available to that many people up until recently.

Speaker 3:          02:00:13       You mean? I'm sorry. You're saying the examples are more numerous or a capacity to discern them is higher. Our capacity to discern them and just our in depth understanding of these various cultures all over the world. Like, like what you've been telling you today about these divers and others, we just have so much more data and so much more of an understanding than ever before. Yes, I love the idea that we are, I mean I believe that this is probably the best time ever to be alive and I think that it's probably, I think that's true. I think there's certainly a lot of terrible things that are wrong in the world today also true. But I think that there's less of that and more good and compare that too before. No, I think that's right. And, but one of the arguments that I make is this is a kind of Steven pinker argument that you're outlining, which is, you know, with the emergence of, I mean, people are living longer than they ever have on the whole planet.

Speaker 3:          02:01:05       Fewer people in starvation. We have less violence. I mean, every indicator of human wellbeing is up. Uh, and it's partly due, are largely due in the recent last thousand years to the, uh, to the emergence of the enlightenment and a, the Phyllis, the philosophy and the science that was guided that emerged about 300 years ago and 200 and some odd years ago and culminating in the present and continuing. So I think, I think this is not just the kind of so-called weekish view of history. It's not just a progressive sort of fantasy. I think it's the case that these philosophical and moves that our species made in the last few hundred years has improved our wellbeing. However, as we've been discussing today, it's not just historical forces that are tending towards making us better off a deeper and more ancient and more powerful force is also at work, which is natural selection. It's evolutionary and not just historical forces that are relevant to our wellbeing.

Speaker 3:          02:02:03       And we don't just need to look to philosophers to find the path to a good life. Natural selection has equipped us with these capacities for love and friendship and cooperation and teaching and all these good things we've been discussing that also tend to a good life. So, so yes, I totally, we would do, we're better off today than we've ever been on average across the world. However, it's not just that, that's contributing to our wellbeing. This natural selection is literally why we are in this state now and why we were hoping this trend will continue. We will be in this better place 50 years from now, 100 years from now. Well, natural selection doesn't work over those time scales. So those are historical forces. But the point is we are set up for success. Yes. Um, you know, we are equipped with these, uh, you know, you're given five fingers, which make it pos and an opposable thumb, which allows you to manipulate tools.

Speaker 3:          02:02:53       So natural selection has given you an opposable thumb. Culture lets you use a computer. Do you worry about the circumventing of this natural process by artificial intelligence that artificial intelligence is going to introduce some new, incredibly powerful factor into this whole chain of events that by having sex robots and sex or, or, or, or, um, robot workers, yes. Things becoming automated. Yes. This I, I'm concerned. I mean, this is, I, I'm very concerned about how technology is going to affect our economy. These, again, these concerns were not the first generation to face these concerns. There were similar concerns with the industrial revolution that workers were being put out of work when machines were invented. Nevertheless, work persisted. People still had jobs to do. Um, there was a disruption. There's no doubt about it. I think Google and the information revolution and these types of robotic automation are disruptive.

Speaker 3:          02:03:49       They're going to affect how we allocate labor and capital and data in our society. There's no doubt about all of that. I thought you were alluding to just to check if you were to the debate, which I don't know the answer to on whether AI will, are we going to face like a terminator type existence where you know the machine's rise up and kill us all or not and you know very smart people on both sides of that debate. And I read them all and like I would like, he's right. And then there'd be the guy that has the opposite, but I'm like, no, no, he's right. And then it goes back and forth. I don't know who's writing it goes back to nuance, right? Yes, it is nuanced, but it's hard to know whether, again, we're not talking over our lifetimes, right over hundreds of years, you know?

Speaker 3:          02:04:30       Is there a time a thousand years from now when the human beings will say, what the hell were our ancestors doing inventing artificial intelligence that they're wiping us out? I don't know the answer to that question. I think there's an issue also with the, the concept of artificial, like artificial life, artificial intelligence. It's, I think it's going to be life because it's is going to be a life that we've created. And I don't think it's artificial. I just think it's a different kind of life. I think that we're thinking of biologically based life of sex reproduction in terms of the way we've always known it as being the only way that life exists. But if we can create something and that something decides to do things, it's sound create, live on its own. Yeah. It's silicon based life form. Like why not? Why, why does life have to be something that only exists through the, you know, multiplication of cells.

Speaker 3:          02:05:23       Yes. That's very charitable of you. And uh, it's, people make that claim. Uh, some people think that, you know, those machines in the distant future, we'll look back at us as like one stage of evolution that culminated in them that we're some, I've always said that we are some sort of an electronic, uh, Caterpillar that doesn't know that it's going to give birth to a butterfly. We're making a cocoon. We don't even know what it's doing. That's a great metaphor. I have a hard time accepting that because you're a person. Yes, it's, it gets my interest, but we're so flawed. All these things that we've outlined all the pipes with us, those would go away with artificial intelligence. It's a deep philosophical question, Joe. I would think it's inevitable and I think if the single celled organisms are sitting around wondering what the future was going to be like, where are we going to be replaced?

Speaker 3:          02:06:08       Will they make antibiotics and kill us? Yes. What's gas? They aren't going to kill us. I mean this is, I mean we are so fluff denigrate the ocean. We do pull the fish out of it and do fuck up the air, do commit genocide. There's all these things that are real, but the artificial life won't have those problems because it won't be emotionally based, won't be biologically based. It'll just exist. That's a really good story. We're so flawed. Why not? Oh, we're very flawed. We are flawed, but like I said, we have a fun activity at it. I'm not going to read a very flat though. We are fly. I think it's beautiful. Beautiful too. But I think vultures probably think they're beautiful too. That's why they breed with each other. Well, they are beautiful, but, but the point is I think we have a flop beauty.

Speaker 3:          02:06:49       I like, I'm going to stick to my principles that we are, despite our flaws worth it. There is something wonderful about us. And I think that that wonderful creative quality is the reason why we created artificial life in the first place. It's like this, this creation. We've had that impetus. You know, if you look at a lot of the, um, the art, whether it's the Egyptian, you know, the, the, the, the pyramids a or other kinds of, um, artistic expression, we seem to have had a desire to transcend death, you know, to make things that sure that looked like us but weren't alive forever actually. So, I mean, I think in that regard, I think you're quite right that, um, it's not going to stop. That tendency is not gonna stop now. You're, you're very, as I said, positive take on the claim and your analogy to single celled organisms, which are just, you know, but a fleeting, not a fleeting, they're still there, but a phase in our evolution, you know, is something I'm going to have to be thinking about because it's disturbing, honestly.

Speaker 3:          02:07:50       Well, it's an objective perspective. If I took myself out of the human race, which I really can't, but if I tried to fake it, I would say, oh, I see what's going on here. Yeah. These domains is, yes, these dummies are buying iPhones and new Mac books because they, they know that this is what's going to help the production of newer, more superior technologies. The more we consume. It's also based, I think in a lot of ways our insane desire for materialism is fueling this and it could be an inherent property of the human species that it is designed to create this artificial life and that literally is what it's here for. And much like an ant is creating an ant hill and doesn't exactly have some sort of a future plan. It's kids and it's four o one k plan that what we're doing is like this inherent property of being a human being, our curiosity, our wanderlust, our design, our culture things.

Speaker 3:          02:08:45       Yeah. All these things are built in because if you follow them far enough down the line a hundred years, 200 years, it inevitably leads to artificial life. Yes. I think, uh, I think that's possible. Um, and of course we're not going to be alive to test that idea. Their son will maybe with CRISPR and all this crazy shit that's coming down. I'll come on. I know there's nothing's gonna happen in the pace of innovation. People always had been say, if you go back every decade, people say just around the corner, just around the corner, these things that are take forever. They're very hard. Biological systems are very hard to engineer. Um, I don't, and you know, of course the people who do that kind of work will often, I think a lot of them engage in snake oil. You know, they want to fund. There was sure, but I think it's entirely possible that there's a 20 year old listening to this podcast will be 150 yes.

Speaker 3:          02:09:31       That's possible. Maybe a lot more than that. I think there's, I think it's entirely possible that 30 year olds today, it could be 150, but I think there's, you give another 10 years of research, you give maybe 10 years more. I think it's entirely, well, there's a famous bad about this. You may know they feel Schonski I'll stood bet. Yes. Where they bet that uh, about 10 or 20 years ago, they bet that there was a person born that then that year who would live to be 150. And on one side you had one guy who said no, they, they, they, they bet $1 billion and they endowed it with, uh, they opened up a bank account. They put in, you know, they're using compound interest to get to that sum of money. And they obliged can nerds. Yes. And they obliged and they have lives. They're a clear bag. Yeah. And they, and they, and they designated the National Academy of Sciences or some entity like that, that would, um, that would adjudicate the baton 150 years. And, uh, and they, they specify the kinds of documentation that might be needed and they allowed for in the future. They may be other ways of ascertaining how old someone

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       is and those can be used. And that's the bet. Uh, so I, you might be right about that. Like, you know, there are humans that live naturally to be 120. We have that capacity. Actually, here's an interesting idea. Why do we die at all? Why is natural selection ever given us an immortal species? Have you ever thought about that? Yeah. Yeah. I have never reached a conclusion, but I, I was figured you live long enough. We'll, especially up until recent history, only long enough to recognize it. It was all crazy hustle. That's a fourth philosophical, I'm looking for a scientific answer. Here's, here's one answer for why we're not immortal. So if you think about it, why would natural selection not have created a creature that lived forever, right? Would that be? Why did, why should we die? Okay, so here's the one answer. It's not know for sure if this is the answer, but this is a good answer.

Speaker 2:          02:11:27       Imagine there to two different kinds of things that can kill you. Intrinsic Causes, an extrinsic causes, so things inside your body that result in you dying, defects, diseases and so forth, or things outside your body, like accidents, lightening strikes, trees fall, and you just die and so forth because it's impossible to eliminate all extrinsic causes because some people are going to die from accidents. It would be inefficient from the point of view of evolution to evolve, to be immortal because we would have all this capacity to be immortal. We would have these body's capable of a mortality, which let's say would be evolutionarily demanding, like to evolve anything like an I or a brain or strong, any, any quality. Lactase, right? We, like we talked about earlier, you, you don't have lactase persistence into adulthood because it's not needed. So evolution doesn't waste anything. There'd be no reason for that.

Speaker 2:          02:12:20       So there'd be no that would be there would uh, there, uh, there would be no reason the argument goes to evolve in mortality because inevitably some people would be killed eventually by accidents anyway. So unless you can create a world in which there are no accidents, there are no extrinsic causes of death, it would be inefficient from an evolutionary point of view to evolve in mortality. So death, the reason we die naturally, some people think is that the reason we dynamically is that there are unnatural causes of death in the world, like accidents. If we could eliminate the unnatural causes so that nowhere, no, no time ever where we ever killed by trees falling or lightening strikes or things like that, then actually over time we would evolve to live indefinitely. This is the theory. It's crazy idea. It is fascinating. But do you think that nature had that sort of sort of foresight? He was not a foresight, but that's how natural selection works. Think about like if I suddenly magically transformed your body at great expense to make you capable of immortality.

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       And then two days from now you're hit by a bus. I've wasted all that effort. But if you only done it to one person, you wasted that effort. If you did did it to other people, you have the potential to create an incredibly wise person with a thousand years of life and experience and education die. He also had die. So everyone eventually would die from these extrinsic causes. So personal law, well, no, that's, that's, that's their assumption in the model. If it's not perhaps if in fact there are no extremes, if in fact there is a world in which you're never struck by lightning, never hit by a bus, never a tree branch, then uh, then the theory is that we would have evolved to be a mortal. So it's almost like the law, the life that you live, you're inevitably going to get killed by extrinsic causes.

Speaker 3:          02:14:13       Yes. If you extend that life to a thousand years and it's absolutely going to happen, therefore why bother? That's just living in a bubble. Just terrified of the world on rocks. Lamberg and gentry. Yeah, but you can't transport, you can't take this theory. And this model and apply to an individual and an individual life. It's about how our species evolved. It's not about how you should live your life. I mean it's also true. I don't think you should live your life afraid. I think that's a difficult, I think that's a sad life. To live a life afraid. It takes practice to be unafraid of, you'd be more afraid if you could live a thousand years without an accident. You know? Cause if like if you're one of those crazy rock climber, dude's like Alex Honnold and he's crazy. He's crazy. I love him though. He's told, have you talked? Have you met him?

Speaker 3:          02:14:55       Yeah, I've had him on a couple of times. Oh my God, he's awesome. I'm sure he has his Amygdala. Of course he's a, Migdal is fucked up. You know this, right? He has no fear. Now he does have fear. You're wrong. Oh really? Absolutely. As fear. He just understands his capacity and his ability you think is rashly, says I can do this, therefore I should not be afraid cause I read that he takes scanned his brain and that his, his fear centers are different than the rest of us is what I read. Maybe that's wrong. I don't know. Did he tell you he didn't say anything about that? No, I think he's using his patient. I don't know about that. He said basically that the experience, he just stays mellow and calm and then if things go wrong it's really bad. Like you don't want to be freaking out.

Speaker 3:          02:15:35       Yes. It's so diverse. You don't panic when you're underwater and you lose your way. Right. There was a consumes oxygen a lot mazing story that my friend Donald Cerrone, he's a UFC fighter told about being trapped in a cave and despegar watering out when it was running out of oxygen. Yeah. Horrible, crazy scary story. And you have to, those guys are also different. Either they, either they're born that way or they learn to be that way. You have to keep calm because when you and I lose our cool and start hyperventilating, our auction consumption skyrockets. And that's the opposite of what you need to do in that situation. Actually what he talked about, you know, like trying to stay calm and battling the demons not going to die like this. Yeah. What an incredible story. Yeah. The Alex Honnold thing I hear is something, I watched the movie, what it talks to him.

Speaker 3:          02:16:23       He got an MRI and they said that, what did it say? Yeah, he's a, Migdal is different, but what did it say? How does it say the kids Amygdala isn't firing. Yes. Okay. But isn't that possible that that's just through development of constant, it is also possible calm while you were in life threatening situations. It's possible like to see fighters brains measured in that regard. I would like to see soldiers, well, special forces guys. I think that's right. And the guys a special force guys. It's like the capacity to shoot back when you're being shot at keeping your calm moving positions, you know, and so forth. Those are all very important to abilities, not panicking. Uh, but and it is also the case that some people, for example, the most famous study in this regard was a study of London taxi drivers. London taxi drivers can go from any point in the city to any other point in the city.

Speaker 3:          02:17:10       It's called the knowledge. They have a mental map of the whole city and it's freakish. It takes years to be able to know how to navigate the city with the thousands of Nate, tens of thousands of street names and they can do it by like dead reckoning. They a scan. This was a paper about 10 years ago. They brain scan these guys and they had, I forgot what region of the brain, but they had through learning it is felt modify that region of the brain. So it's possible. Holland is like you say, that he learned to be this way. That is a big deal isn't firing because he trained himself but I handled, handled, handled. I'm sorry handled is this way because he learns well, but it's more likely I think that he's like Usain bolt that was born with the credibly, a high preponderance of fast twitch fibers in his leg so he can run like the wind and he trains as well. You have both, right. Good athletes require both innate ability plus training and I think a Honnold is probably like that. He was probably born with an Amygdala. It doesn't fire so much and he's an amazing, uh, you know, climber is purely speculative, right? Like the, and they also, the nature versus nurture would apply to chess players as well. I would like to see their brain scan like w uh, Gary Kasparov. I know Gary. Yes. I would love to see that. I got a brain scan. Yes. Yeah. He's an interesting guy to hit.

Speaker 6:          02:18:27       What I'll say. The article goes way more into depth and night. Well, I just showed you about, okay. Just that sentence. She, she's at the doctor who studied it was specifically looks at people that go under high stress and look for those kinds of things. She's been doing that since 2005, I guess. And she goes, it's pages long. This whole thing about his brain, but it is unusual, but it also,

Speaker 3:          02:18:47       the amount of time, think about people that are in high stress. High stress is one thing. This kid is in a life threatening absolute fatality situation. Mistake his death every day. I know all day. I know. I mean, he lives in a van and just climbs. Yes. That's what he does. It's really fascinating. Yes, it is. It is. It's amazing. Honestly. It's amazing. So I mean, I don't know. I'd never met him. I admire him very much. And I love this. Like we said at the beginning, it's very important to have skills of any kind. So his skills are amazing. Uh, admire music, musical skills in carpentry skills and martial arts skills and skills and medical. I admire skills, you know, I think it's in its worth cultivating. Yeah. It's worth cultivating those skills. So you find out more about yourself through acquiring these skills and knowledge and information and just abilities.

Speaker 3:          02:19:39       Yes. You learn and you also learn about how to acquire skills. Yes. Yes, I think that's right. And I think, uh, and I think it's also a kind of, you also find oftentimes that the, the practice of acquiring the skill teaches you other things that can then be used in other areas. Yeah. So even if you like, you know, like, uh, like you make the effort to learn the violin or to learn Chinese for example, or whatever, you know, some effort, you, that self discipline then can be translated into even just something that you're not so good at it, but it's still useful to have that. That's the mia moto massage. He quote the book from the Book of five rings once, you know, the way broadly you see it in all things. Yes. Yeah. That's very good. Yeah. I remember at my mind is lashing back to, we're talking about mortality.

Speaker 3:          02:20:23       Do you remember that scene at a, at Helms Helms deep when, uh, in the Lord of the rings when, um, uh, they're protecting, you know, the, the, uh, the key to the castle and the elves come and help the humans. Do you know the movie? Probably know the, yeah. And I was, I was very sad when these elves were killed because if they hadn't been killed by extrinsic forces, they would have lived a long time. Uh, they would have been immortal. So it's like a, especially sad loss. Anyway, I had wanted to mention that earlier when we were talking about that thing. So now what was the saying again? You just said about once, you know, the way broadly you'll see it in all things. Yes, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. It was just about acquiring excellence in something that you understand what it takes to acquire excellence in something and you can apply that to other things as well. It's the same process, just a different path. Yes, that's right. Well, listen, Nicholas, thank you so much for being here. Thank you so much. I can't wait to read this book. I'm going on vacation, so I'm going to read this with me. All right. And, uh, some of the stories at the beginning, I really did. Thank you so much, so much for having me. Shit. I've been really grateful. Thanks man. Thanks so much. Bye everybody.
