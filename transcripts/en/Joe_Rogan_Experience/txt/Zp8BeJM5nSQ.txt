Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Do we live? Did I say moral technique on the air? Maybe. Good. I said good things. I love that dude. He'll be here on Monday. This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by ting. Now, if you've seen the teen news recently, and let me see, ting dropped their rates. They uh, to celebrate, celebrate, celebrate. They um, dropped their prices to celebrate two years. They cut their rates in half. Um, let me see exactly what they did. They slashed their prices permanently there permanently slashing prices to celebrate their second birthday. I fucking love shit like that. When you don't have to do stuff like that and you'd do it just because you want people to feel good about your company. What, uh, what I enjoy the most about ting is the feedback. [inaudible] excuse me. The feedback that we get from people that have used it, it's all positive. I haven't had one person say, Eh dated, but I didn't really see them many. According to 10, 98% of people save money. Let's see what exactly they did. Ting trajectory toward shorter, I'm trying to find the news just as drops. Prices. Google it. Oh, I know. I shouldn't tell you to Google it. I should have this nose, but I don't, didn't come. I had to find it online. It didn't come as a part of the ad thing

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       anyway, they dropped their prices a lot. So since I can't find the news that quickly, uh, just accept that permanently permanently dropped the prices, which is a fucking tricky thing to say. You permanently draft your issue permanently. What about a hundred fucking thousand years from now, dude? How much is that chicken across then? People got to be careful because the world will still be around. Maybe that's what everybody planted for the apocalypse with. That motherfucker never comes. What if it never comes and you stay alive? Then what bitch? Huh? Then what? Anyway, this episode brought to you by Tang and ting. Would they are is a mobile company that uses sprint backbone. They buy time on sprint and rented out to you, but they do it in a way that most cell phone companies don't like. They don't have any contracts and live any bullshit.

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       They don't have any early termination fees. They're truly and completely contract free and they sell the best android phones in the world. I switched to android and I'm very happy with it and I also, I'm even more happier because, uh, once we had a end dress Antonopoulos on the podcast and the day talking to us about Bitcoin, um, he was talking about how the Apple App for Bitcoin is not very good. Then apple pulled it. They actually pulled the fucking app. Did they give a reason for why they pulled it? It's gross because 120,000 people, it already downloaded that bitcoin app and they were using it and apple just decided for whatever fucking reason that they're not going to let you download it anymore. It's, I think gross when you download, I mean if you have something that's as mainstream as Bitcoin, I mean, I wouldn't say bitcoins mainstream, but when you get to be 120,000 downloads, that's pretty, pretty significant and growing.

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       It's clearly growing. I mean, every day I see in the news things about Bitcoin, different companies accepting Bitcoin, Vegas casinos accepting bitcoin. And so for apple to step in with no explanation, unless there's an explanation, like they don't like the software, it has vulnerability. They thought they should have to tell you that. But if you just pull it and don't say a word that's smacks of censorship. To me that sounds gross. I don't know what's going on, but more and more I'm, I'd lean towards android and, um, I just think there's a billion fucking people that are using cell phones, probably more in the world. And something like 80% of them are on the android platform now. Something like 80 something percent smartly. Let me find that out for sure. How many people use android?

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       Apple dropped it for a unresolved issue. What does that mean? That doesn't mean anything. You didn't say a word. She didn't say that we dropped it for an unresolved issue. Oh, okay. What does that mean? You want to be king of the world and it didn't work out yet. The fuck did you do? Huh? You sons of bitches? Um, uh, whatever, it's, whatever the numbers are, who gives a shit? It's a very high number of people that are using a android. It's um, in, uh, it depends on where you're at. There's worldwide, worldwide, it's like 70%. It looks like, um, this is pretty crazy that the numbers are growing too. It wasn't one point in time, like almost all the smartphones, like good percentage of when the iPhone and then slowly but surely the enter it started to get better and better. And now they, uh, they're actually the majority, uh, and there's so many people working on them too.

Speaker 1:          00:04:53       There's the new ones are pretty fucking bad ass.

I'm Aubrey, I think you know a thing or two about honor. You've heard of the company?

Speaker 1:          00:08:12       Yeah, a little bit controversial place that sells awesome shit. And I'm one of the newest that, uh, I really enjoy. I've been mixing in my protein shakes. Is this a the new Greens supplement? Tell me about that shit. Well, what we wanted to do is just get a bunch of the healthiest stuff you could and freeze dried powdered format. So we got a bunch of the actual Greens, then we got some of the different colored vegetables like beets and some of the other things that you might be missing from your diet. Put in some probiotics, put in some enzymes, a few of the herbs that are good for liver and some of your organs and basically put together kind of a, Oh shit, I haven't had my diet right. Kind of Greens that you can add and make sure that you're at least covered from a micronutrient micro vitamin

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       basis that just has basically all the good nutrients in it possible. Well, it's a great mix of stuff too. Um, I've, I've read the ingredients, the ingredients list. It's pretty fucking powerful. How did you, uh, how'd you, how'd you formulate this? Well, one of the key things that we found is I was looking at antioxidant potential as well. And you know, I'm fairly familiar with Peru and kind of some of the things that come out of there and there was a purple corn that comes out of Peru that they grow pretty much exclusively in that region and it has it really, really high or act value. And Oreck is, is a useful tool. It's not the end all be all, but it's an antioxidant measurement. You know how many free radicals get quenched by the natural compound. And that's a process that goes on normally in the body and it's a really high amount of that more so than even some of the other berries like us, I, he, Barry and all these other barriers that get really highly touted. So we put, you know, a bunch of that in there and then just went from there and got a bunch of full spectrum Greens and put it all together. Everything being food based, you know, just all the coolest, best foods that we could get, which is the best way for your body to absorb. Absolutely. All this, the best supplements that you can get or are food based and which is why those studies that came out recently were so stupid

Speaker 3:          00:10:09       and annoying because if you don't know the studies we're talking about, there's a this really bold proclamation from whatever study vitamins don't work, they're not worth it. It's waiting now, not worth your time. And they're conclusion. Closed case closed. Their conclusions were based on two of the grossest studies ever for saying that vitamins don't work. One of them was people over 65 that have had heart attacks that were fucking old and had heart attacks and it didn't stop there. Their progression of, you know, death or whatever, which is ridiculous. You're over 65 you have a heart attack, you're fucking, that's like saying, you know, I had a 72 Pontiac with a blown motor. It was going down the highway and you change the tire and it didn't fucking fix my car. Like your machine's already broken men. You've, you're having a heart attack at 65 like this shit is close to the end.

Speaker 3:          00:10:58       The wheels are falling off the ride. And the other one was physicians who are over 65 who were showing cognitive decline. It didn't slow down their cognitive decline. Okay, so vitamins don't work because of that. Like what the fuck man? People are really gross with that shit where they want to say it doesn't work. Doesn't work. Why is that? Because a lot of stuff doesn't work, but a lot of stuff does. All right, and that's why these vitamins were made in the first place. The whole reason why they were extracted from food analyzed is because people needed to know what the basic compounds of nutrients where. What is it about vitamin C that keeps people from getting scurvy? What is it about vitamin B 12 that gives you energy? What is it about vitamin D that you get from the sign? All the, this is science.

Speaker 3:          00:11:44       Like everyone's pretending that this is all like, oh, the pseudo science of supplements. Fuck you. You fat, lazy piece of Shit. You don't know nothing about your body. All right, that's what's going on. All you fucking people that are like, you know, you don't need that. Eat a balanced guy. Oh really? Doctor. Well, why don't you run up a hill with me? Fuck. Why don't you tell me about optimum physical performance? You don't know unless you supplement. Unless you have a healthy body, you don't know the difference between optimum and suboptimum. You just exist at this sub optimum state and thanks. Wow. What she, I have a cup of coffee. I have my eggs and bacon and I go to work and I've got no problem whatsoever with my health. Why? I just got back from a doctor. People always want to tell you that I just got back from the doctor with a clean Palette health.

Speaker 3:          00:12:26       I'll fucking strangle. You know you don't have a clean bill of health. You're fucking dying, man. Look at your face has fallen off your skin. Stop it. Yeah. There's a difference between being okay surviving and being optimal and to be optimal. You got put in, you know, how are you going to eat? There's 24 natural ingredients in this [inaudible]. How are you going to get these 24 ingredients in every day diet? It's going to be a pain in the [inaudible]. You could have a 10 inch television who needs a 55 inch television. I watch TV on a 10 inch television and I'm fine. I don't need a new car. I've got a 1958 Subaru.

Speaker 1:          00:13:01       Did they even make Subaru's in 58 probably not. That's probably all shitty American cars back then and a couple of Ferrari's. It's probably all they had either way. Shut up all of you and go to the blog that Aubrey wrote about this because it's a very good blog and is there a straight link to the blog from the, the main site? I'm trying to find your hair, get on it and then blog. Yeah, get on it and then blog, um, or being, or being on it and blog if you've never been on it before, what we call on it is a human optimization website. Well, we sell, whether it's supplements or whether it's strength and conditioning equipment is all stuff that we a know works and be used when it comes to kettle bells when it comes to battle ropes. Those are my absolute favorite strength and conditioning pieces of equipment.

Speaker 1:          00:13:48       There's nothing to me better than kettle bells. I think there's nothing that I've ever done that, uh, I feel like I have full control over. Like I don't, I don't worry about it. Like there's certain things that I worry about, like I've run with sandbags up hills and I think there's a lot of tricky shit when you're running up hills and like, you know, a rocky terrain and stuff like dirt, dirt trails when you're running over things. Like, I like it. I think it's a great way to like really build some serious endurance. But man, I don't really feel totally in control. I'm kind of sandbag. I'm running up a hill, done it with heavy bags too, like, you know, like, uh, kicking bags. But with kettle bells, I feel like I can get an absolutely fucking brutal death defying workout in. And I know what I'm doing. I use proper technique. I don't get hurt using kettle bells. Man. I can just absolutely say that I have been using kettle bells for at least a decade now. I have zero injuries from training with Kettlebells, kettlebells. And one of the reasons folks is I got a trainer, okay. Um, I've had several. The first one was Jamie Walsh, my English friend, the night

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       I, Steve Maxwell also have someone, uh, Justin Milo's, who's the best love this fucking guy, the guy I'm using now. It's a good friend of mine as well. Find someone who can teach you the basic fundamentals, whether it's, you know, a gym that you have to hire a trainer and let them, you know, tape you with a cell phone so you can repeat your movements or watch a video. If you don't have anybody anywhere near where you live that has a kettle bells or understands how you watch a video and start out light, use like an 18 pound kettle bell or 25 pound kettle ball. Trust me, you will be fucking manly, man. I don't need a 25 pound kettle. You know, you'd also don't need torn ligaments. You don't need to drop a kettle bell in your head. Stupid. You don't need to fuck up. Your Turkey has get up and now you have a different face. All right? Be careful, but if you aren't careful, you will enjoy the fuck out of it and you'll join the fuck out of everything. We sell it on it. That's O. N N I t. Use the codeword Rogan and save yourself 10% off any n all supplements. My brother Aubrey Marcus is here. Yeah, buddy. Same time. Cue The music.

Speaker 5:          00:15:57       Joe Rogan Experience Joe Rogan podcast all day.

Speaker 6:          00:16:08       Okay,

Speaker 4:          00:16:10       and here we are, ladies and gentlemen. One more time. Live kicking it. W never worry whether or not we're going to run out of shit to talk about it. I don't ever want you to worry about that. Before we had this conversation, obviously we still have shit to talk about. We're always going to have shit to talk about it. There's no, the world is a crazy fucking place filled with madness and d is never going to change and there's, oh, we shouldn't talk about, that's the most beautiful thing about having a podcast. It's like being a dirt minor now. That's just fucking dirt everywhere, man. You can't go wrong. There's always something to talk about. And Jamie, you sent me something over this weekend that was a about the drugs are getting fucked over or uh, getting fucked off at. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:16:50       Yeah. It happened this week actually, I think it was Tuesday. Um, Cup quite a few congressmen got their chance to take their shot out. My, I suppose,

Speaker 4:          00:16:58       and this is the drugs are under the Obama administration called the czar is kind of Russian. Why are you doing drugs are, that's a fucking stupid. Do you think gluten makes us hookers? Columns are, uh, he probably has some American name. You'll call me president of the United States because present though, they all want to be president, United States, all those gangsters that are running those, you know, they know Russia is a mess. You don't want to run that thing. They should be fucking running America flying over New York City and fucking Soluton people. But no trap in that frozen wasteland with a few goods. Scott got some stars and stripes boxer briefs that he pulls out. Bay does. I bet it does. Basically, he's a secret. Want to be American, right? So what did they say to this fucking Bizarre Colin?

Speaker 7:          00:17:39       I'm not quite sure the czar gets his chance to talk back to this guy. This went on for like an hour and a half. Quite a few. Like I said, quite a few guys got their chance at them. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:17:47       talk about low hanging fruit. Well,

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       shitting on the drugs. Are they mean if the Zen, it's this effort. Has there ever been any sort of a company, any sort of a, an off, any sort of an office that has had less success than the people that look for the war on drugs? The abolitionist, a banning alcohol and the 20s and right. Good. That's even like less because they abandoned that one. Yeah, they gave up. Fuck it. We tap out. The war on drugs is like a dude that just keeps getting his ass kicked. Just getting up. Keep getting his ass kicked. Did you, you're not even close to winning this fight. There's no way you're going to win this fight. Like the idea of a war on drugs and being run by Ozar. Holy Schmoe. What up fucking what a terrible job. You guys have done. Out of all the things we think about, look, the great thing with the Department of, uh, what a transportation, whoever's done the highway systems, I mean, it's amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:18:47       You can drive from California to New York City. You could do it in four days. Anybody can do it. You could drive all the way up to Canada. You drive down to Florida. I mean, you could literally make your way across the entire country, visit every state by car. I mean that had to be worked out slowly but surely. We had a paved roads. We had to chop down trees, blow holes through mountains. That was awesome. They did an amazing job. I mean, people that want to complain about the highway system, dude, what? You make your own highway. Let's see what you would do. Yeah. It's not perfect. It's made by humans. Nothing we do is perfect, but then the drugs are, it's like creating a highway where only people crash. Yeah, that's it. It's just only crashes and falls apart. It's just bridges fall down.

Speaker 3:          00:19:31       You run straight into mountains where they're supposed to be tunnels. Sometimes it's concrete. Sometimes it's paper over Saint Coles don't tell Ya. Yeah. Yeah. I mean they're their fate. A total abject failures. There's never been like EP department that has failed more like across though. Even in the fucking immigration, they stopped some of that shit, you know they fucking have, you know, everybody knows about those border patrol guys. They, they have a run across the border if they want to make it into America. There's a lot of work and crossing into from Mexico into America. It's not a done deal, but the war on drugs get the fuck outta here. The amount of damage you've done to drugs is absolutely zero. All you've taken a few drugs out of the system. The fuck you have. You've just made them more expensive and a commodity so people can create these gangster organizations.

Speaker 3:          00:20:20       Yeah. Even even crazier that that part create these Mexican cartels. Well, you remember when we were kids in Mexico was a nice place to visit. Fuck yeah. I'm going to be telling some stories about going over just going over the border of Mexico. This was 15 years ago, 14 years ago. It wasn't that scary that me and Eddie Bravo went to a spring break in Mexico at Cane Kuhn bought it the first year and that was work. It was kind crazy. We got hammered too. It was, it was a work get way too hammered and then recover and then fly home disaster for fucking pounding headache. I was doing something for MTV. I'm glad you remember it. Yeah, I don't think he does, but, but we had a good time. Um, but my point is there was no apprehension. You know, we were like, oh, it's going to be fun.

Speaker 3:          00:21:09       We're going to go a see a bunch of concerts. Like puddle of Mudd was there. I met the rock and it was the first time I met the rock who's a skinnier version of the rock, but I was a skinnier version of me too. Um, and uh, you know, met a bunch of people. They were back. It was fun. It was a big deal. We're just going to go to Mexico just like, you know how I feel like if I would go to Australia, yeah, it's cool. Here we are. But now it's like fucking beheadings and chainsaws and people hanging from bridges and body bags, plastic hefty bags filled with chopped up people. And he leans out from his Cape and says, you're welcome world. You're welcome. Could I have done my fingers? Wave prevented crying. Imagine what it would be if I wasn't here and what a shit job.

Speaker 3:          00:21:55       Because they've literally pumped up gigantic criminal organizations by keeping people from legitimately selling things that they want to sell. And we're not even done lean. There's, there's always gonna be something that the community doesn't want and there's always going to be idiots who want that something, whether it's smelling paint those crazy fucks that blow paint into a paper bag and then they huff it. That's what they're doing. I mean, they're just, they're taking fucking paint and they're smelling it. You can't prevent that. You can't prevent that kind of retard. You can't, you can't stop it. So as long as there are hammers, there's going to be someone that hits himself in the fucking face with a hammer. There's no, there's no way to prevent that. So to to make things completely across the board illegal just because they're dangerous. That sets a really fucked up precedent because you've got to start examining all the other things that are legal.

Speaker 3:          00:22:48       Like here, I don't want to suggest this, but here, how come you could get a lighter at a fucking gas station and how come that gas station has a pump that pours flammable liquid on it and there's no guards anywhere. There's no one to stop you from just pouring flammable liquid on someone's car and lighting a match and throwing it on there. There's no one there to stop that. But everybody's worried that people are going to have guns. Oh, what's the people with the guns are going to kill, but they're her walk random and the people and just kill people. They could also light you on fire at the gas station. Okay. That doesn't happen now, you know? I mean, we can't stop people from selling saws at fucking home depot because someone runs out and just runs into the mall. Just start sewing at people. We can't. And the other argument was all loaded gun is more effective tool. That's true. So bombs. Okay. And you can make those. There's the fucking, you can make real legitimate bombs at of all the things that you could find

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       in your average chemical store, things that are legal and you can make them bite with the ingredients on the Internet. It's out there, but then you take this back to drugs and let's say it's not actually, most of these drugs are not anything like taking a hammer and hitting yourself in the head. It's actually, you know, as we've all seen, and we'll talk about, I'm sure on this one, as we always do, myriad benefits from all of these different drugs. And not only that, so let's say it was like a hammer. Let's say it was punching yourself in the head with a hammer. Well, the punishment for doing that to prevent you from doing that is to throw you in a box with crazy criminals and completely dehumanize you where you may or may not get raped. Who knows? I watched a lot of Oz.

Speaker 4:          00:24:26       It looks like it sucks and there, but there's no possible way that that isn't worse than what you're doing to yourself when you're taking some drugs in your house. Yeah. They're not trying to help you, not just punishing you and making it scary for everybody else. And by the way, I'm not against gun regulations at all. I should just be real clear about that. I'm also not against drug regulations. I think it shouldn't be easy to go to a doctor and just get oxycontin's. I think there's a reason why, and by the way, whoever sent me some information about that apparently, uh, since we had that podcast with the people from vanguard, did the oxycontin express that documentary, apparently Florida has tightened down there a drug laws substantially because of that, because that documentary exposed how fucking insane that whole oxycontin expresses that goes from Florida to the northern states.

Speaker 4:          00:25:21       It's just a pipeline of Oxycontin and the massive amount of people that have prescriptions for it. But now it's apparently becoming a real issue for the people that are addicted because now they're fucked because they don't have anything to fill. That addiction that was created by the pharmaceutical companies, making sure that the drug prescription laws were very lax in Florida, so they can profit. It's all fucking bananas. So yeah, that would help Ibogaine, um, the, I'm not, I'm not against regulation. Like, you know, everybody thinks that it's a, this is a black and white thing. It's like, no, it's not a black and white thing, but you can't tell people what to do either. You know, I'm not against regulation, but I'm, I'm against you telling people what to do, especially if you can't prove your point. And when, when you start talking about marijuana or psychedelics, when it's mushrooms or even Lsd, the amount of danger that you are in when you take LSD and compare the amount of danger that you take when you eat salt, you know, you could eat, we found out 10 ounces of salt.

Speaker 4:          00:26:26       We'll fucking kill you. 10 ounces. That's it. Nobody thinks about that. But you fucking sprinkles salt in your fries and salt on this and saw it at fucking salted Carmel ice cream. It was delicious. Like we don't think about salt being murderous and deadly, but at a certain level it is. You get to a certain amount of salt, we'll fuck you up. So I'll acid and this is an LD 50 for most things as an LD 50 for mushrooms. It's quite high. LD 50 for marijuana, 1500 pounds in 15 minutes. It's, come on, man. You when you'd say assault is legal and 10 ounces will kill you. I Dunno, I'm beating like two brownies that I'm pretty sure I'm not a die.

Speaker 4:          00:27:07       I've been there when I'm like, I'm not going to be the number one guy, the first guy to die. I'm going to fuck up the whole cause. Well, you know what does die. That was your ego. That's why I feel like that there's, people don't understand what a deep psychedelic experience eating wheat is. It's insanely psychedelic and really, especially if you can do it with an isolation tank, eating the weed and getting it to the tag is like, it was so fucking cyclone a vortex. It takes you to the center of the universe and destroys you, like destroys, like just highlights everything that you don't like about everything you've ever said brings up shit that you said a decade ago. And he was like, what about this? Have you cleaned that up yet? What about that? Do you remember this? This should make you feel bad. Bob Marley said it's the mirror that reveals you to yourself.

Speaker 4:          00:27:54       It really does. People don't like that, but you should. I talked to somebody yesterday and the only drug he'd ever done was he one time he smoked weed and he liked it and he's like, oh, that was awesome. So he made a bunch of brownies and they didn't really know what they were doing and he just ate a bunch of them right? And then had, and he was trying to drive somewhere and meet people and he said it was like the most miserable experience. He's going 40 miles an hour on the highway. He's freaking out. He's sweating. It's the second time he's ever done any, ate too much. He's like, man, I couldn't handle any other psychedelic drugs. I'm like, listen man, I've done most of them and eating too much weed is like the most intense shit I've ever done. You know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          00:28:34       From all over the world. That will fucking get you somewhere. Yeah, I have to deal with it. I felt much better after d and every DMT trip, every DM t trip I've had has freaked me out. That taught me a lot about life, taught me a lot about myself, given me these weird visions and weird insights and, but when it's over, I feel good. I feel like legitimately good when I feel like I get raped when I do too much weed, like I just get mounted by a demon and have my face fucked, just clause in my brain. And then you sitting there taking it. Ooh, knowing, knowing that the end is without a doubt coming, whether it's 50 years or 60 years or a hundred year, however long you think you're gonna live stupid, it's common and no one knows what's next. And your whole life has been running on this momentum of madness the whole life, the whole fucking thing right out of the vagina. Bam, crazy parents, crazy life. Hong Kong, beep beep fuck you tonight on the news, your life madness

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       and trying to stay afloat. You know river of fucking crazy people. Everywhere you go bobbing fucking crazy maniacs all over television, all over school. Every fucking person you date, every person you stick your penis inside or they let you, you stick their penis inside of you. Whatever it is, they're all fucking crazy. And guess what? Fuck phase. You're crazy too. You're crazy. We're all crazy. And then you take a little dip where everything can get quiet and you have this moment of clarity where you can reflect back on this crazy circus you've been in and really think about it. And then maybe make some course corrections. Make some changes pop out of it. That's what's beautiful about it. Didn't Zen, they call it Satori. These moments of clarity and consciousness and a general circus of life awareness. So the reset button, that's it. I'd like to do it once a month, some way or another.

Speaker 3:          00:30:38       Once a month, hit the reset and a lot, you know, I have a huge benefit of having that tank. Having that tank in my basement is so gigantic. Hell yeah. Cause if I ever need to just go on a a wild one, I just eat a pot brownie again. That fucking thing. Space Cheese fries. Yeah. I've become molecules in a never ending fractal universe before I was, uh, I, I was in, it's one vision that was so intense. The problem with these things is they're so intense, especially by the way, when I take Alpha brain, I've got this new way of, uh, wherever we've always talked about the dreams. Like Alpha brain has a really intense effect on dreams, but it also seems to have a very intense effect on the visualizations that I get when I eat marijuana. Like I get it more intense series of things that I see.

Speaker 3:          00:31:32       Like when you eat it, like when you close your eyes, not when I'm, my eyes are open. There's no hallucinogenic effects or at least for me, but what am I close my eyes. I see things in front of my eyelids like dancing cartoons that are neon and they're having sex and breeding and stuff. I see like weird, crazy shit almost, you know, like very, very psychedelic. Like if your eyes were open and you saw those things, you would think, wow, I'm on, I'm on something serious amounts of mushrooms here. But having your eyes closed and just envisioning these things like as a dream somehow I know that they become less preposterous or less crazy, but it's very intensely hallucinogenic and more so it seems when I Take Alpha brain, so the eating of the pot, which is intensely hallucinogenic, I mean I've had wild experiences eating it and just being on a plane and closing my eyes on a plane and seeing just nutty fucking light shows in front of my eyelids. But inside the tank it's just cranks it up to 10 just find some new gear that you didn't know existed. I think seeing those things to me is a good sign that you're in that state of presence. You're in

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       that state of the nether where you're just accessing the unconscious realms of the mind. And that's for me, even when I meditate with nothing, that's what I'm kind of shooting for. It's if I can close my eyes and start drifting into other, just following the visions without trying to direct them or think that's when I know my mind is shut off and that's what I know. I'm in a good, good place and psychedelics tend to have that characteristic always with them as well. And I think it goes hand in hand. It's just that's what happens when the mind gets quiet and you're just kind of floating around looking at these images as they appear. Yeah. So thing

Speaker 3:          00:33:12       that you do when you're in a normal state of consciousness, we sort of see almost controlling and defining your reality by your, your, your ability to see things clearly. You know where they are and you know distances. You've got everything locked down. You know where everything is. You see the people around you see the objects, but when you're on a psychedelic and you're closing your eyes, or even if you're in like having meditation, you're closing your eyes, you, you, your imagination starts to kick in and you start to see and dream and feel things. They don't have to be there. The idea that they have to be, you have to put those on a scale for them to count. Like you have to take those ideas and hit them with a hammer. Otherwise they're not real. No, they're, they're, they're real. Like the, the imaginary idea is that you get with your eyes closed depending on what's causing them, whether it's meditation and Yoga, whether you got punched in the face and you're seeing stars, whatever the fuck it is that's causing it there.

Speaker 3:          00:34:09       There's still, these visions are still real. You know, you could say their hallucinations and you'd be correct medically. But if, say, if I gave you a DMT and I, I told you what I'm going to give you is a natural psychedelic compound that your own brain produces and all it really does when I give it to you is it's going to fuck with your cerebral cortex. Fuck with your visual interpretations of things. And you're going to see things all scrambled up. Like as if like your connectors are plugged in wrong on your television. You just can see a bunch of crazy shit. So don't worry about it. Doesn't mean anything. And you come back and you say, I saw God and he told me the nature of the universe is love and that the universe is actually made of of love. And understanding the suffering only exists for us to be able to truly appreciate the love and as human beings evolve, the suffering and the and the love will do battle.

Speaker 3:          00:35:02       And this is literally the good and evil of the Bible. And this is what, what, why this has been interpreted by every major religion. This is this internal struggle that we all know. This is a reason why it's so admirable when someone becomes a good person, because we know how difficult it is to always choose the light. No, no, no, no, no, no. You were just tripping. No, no, no, no. You don't understand, man. We gave you a DMT in your brain fucked up. Now, if I gave you a another pill and I said, this is a pill that was brought to us by angels and it came in this, this, this beautiful crystal box and it's directly from God and it's a door to door to God's kingdom and you're going to get to talk to him and hang out with them for 15 minutes and you want to do it, you'd be like, oh my God, it's from God.

Speaker 3:          00:35:44       Yes, it's from God. It's from God. It has a look. The pill is a cross on it. Take it so you take it, you go direct and you have the exact same experience that I described, the exact same experience as an experience where the guy told you, oh, just cerebral cortex is confused and you're just seeing shit that's not there in your imagination. Creates got the experience is exactly the same and that's what people have to understand. Everybody wants to the same assholes. I want to bite them. I just don't work. Well, you don't need them. You'd know maybe shut up. It's not what the fuck is going on. This is the exact same reason why there's this need to dispel any notions that you're having spiritual experience and to sort of minimize those experiences, but it's the same experience. And if you benefit from that experience to the same extent as you had benefited from a real visit with angels, then then it's just as good dummy.

Speaker 3:          00:36:35       This is causing the positive effect that you could only dream to achieve by doing that. And it's being duplicated by science to now, you know the swings Hopkins study and it's real. This isn't Mormonism, right? Yeah. This isn't fucking scientists. Golden tablets like found in Pennsylvania or whatever. All you have to do is smoke this stuff and you fucking travel to other dimensions. Like, I'm not making it up. You'd say, I'm making it up, but every fucking person that's ever done it comes back to me and goes, you weren't even making that up. Nope. I wasn't even making up crazy. Huh. Crazy that you're hearing about that from the fear factor guy.

Speaker 2:          00:37:09       So I was thinking about opening the archives. I've never talked about it, but my very first psychedelic experiences that Kinda got me on this path. I've told the IOWASCA story, the bogus story, but this is all after I've been somewhat through the initiation cycle. So I was thinking of getting into that and where was it? So this was, I was like between 18 and 22, so in college and I started my first one at 18 and I'm going to change the geographic location just a little bit, cause in case she's still rocking and rolling out there anyway. So go out to the southwest crossover. Um, she picks me up in a land cruiser. Whatever's got a dog and a car and she is, you know, kind of that loose showman, but more of like a more of like a psychiatric kind of medicine giver, you know, not really.

Speaker 2:          00:37:51       Not trained in these ancient arts are ways and indigenous people. She just kind of knew about the medicine, had a great heart and, and so she picks me up and I'm pretty fucking terrified. I've done nothing. I smoke weed once with my brothers and had laugh and we ate like the worst food. What it means you want to do this? I was like v I'm very curious by nature. Like I wanted to see what was possibly get you involved from gay sex and be very careful. Wow. I haven't been curious about that yet. They'll get, you know, feel free to curious because motherfuckers are tricky. They're guys remember that always you might take guys are God. So yeah. And I was fairly agnostic. I kind of had a sense that maybe there was something more, but I was more borderline atheist add, there ain't shit.

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       You know, you go in a box. All these people are, cause I knew enough and I know I went to high school in Texas and they're always trying to get me to these Christian ministry things and I'm asking him question. They're looking at me like, Huh, you know, I was like, this is a bunch of fucking bullshit. So I was more on the atheist side. So I decided, you know, as a connection through the old, you know, old family friends and I just decided to go off. They're kind of like a rite of passage, so picks me up. I'm nervous as shit. We get to the place, there's some nice little mountains and hills and we got this like little year that I'm going to stay in a year. It was a year. Yeah. Built up out there, no power and anything like that. And uh, so we're going to do it the next day.

Speaker 2:          00:39:12       She says, okay, goodnight. You know, here's everything you need. So I'm up all night. Just nervous as shit cause that you feel like you're about to jump off a cliff. You have no idea what's going to go down. And I sometimes, you know, I get a lot of these people sending me messages and I forget what I was like that very first time cause it's fucking terrifying now. So I get up early in the morning and I go for a long walk and I'm just trying to get my head around this. I'm so afraid that I'm going to completely lose touch with reality, that I'm just, and I may never get back, you know, that's the fear. Like you're going to be so gone. What's there? What's left? How do you cling to anything? You have no control, you know? So I'm freaking out. So on my way back from the hike, I kind of get my head in a good place and I pick up this rock and it's rather flat and I still have it to this day.

Speaker 2:          00:39:55       And I was like, all right, I'm going to hold this rock through the ceremony. And if ever I feel like I'm completely out of touch with the earth, I'm going to have this rock here and that's going to let me know that there are rocks. And one day I'll go back to the world of the rocks and I'll at least be okay. So we go and we're about to start the ceremony. And, um, my very first ceremony was going to be, and she was very open with what she was giving me was going to be a combination of mushrooms and Mtma pure mdms. Whoa, she's candy flipping you right off the bat off the bat. So she and we go and we set an intention. He had me write an intention for what I was going to do and I'm nervous. I have no idea.

Speaker 2:          00:40:31       So I read my intention and I'm already like pretty emotional. And then we have a tea, I drink the tea and I take the pill and I just kind of wait and my heart's thumping. I don't know what's going to happen. And then I think probably the MTMA started kicking in first and I was like, Ugh, God damn, this feels pretty good. And then then the mushrooms started really kicking and then the visionary experience started to happen. And I remember one of my first visions, I was walking through like a field of grass and I was just feeling my hands move through the grass. Like I was pushing, pushing right through the grass. And then I could feel like my breathing didn't seem that necessary anymore. And I was almost becoming disconnected from my breath. And then I could feel the wind coming through and all of a sudden the wind just went right through me and I was, my physical body no longer existed in that moment.

Speaker 2:          00:41:24       It was almost like I am sure I still was breathing, but it felt like I absolutely was not and didn't need to and it didn't matter. And my spirit was disconnected from my body. And at that moment was probably one of the most defining moments in my life. Cause I realized, Holy Shit, this little meet vehicle that I'm really attached to is not what I really am. It's just a car that I'm driving around and for now and like this other thing that I'm experiencing and feeling separate from that body, that's something different. And the clarity I had from that moment, from being able to separate from my body was immense. You know? And I realized at some point, you know, when you're free of, when you're free of these bodily confines and the mind, you're going to be able to look back at your life and see everything that you've done, good or bad.

Speaker 2:          00:42:15       And if it's good and you've lived well and you've pushed out as much love and done the best you can, you're going to be in a heaven, in a heavenly state at that point. It's going to be having, you know, you've done your job in this earth, you've had a great time, you spread the light, spread the love and and done, you know, done what you were there to do basically. But if you've lived, you know, badly and done harm to people and hurt people and increase the suffering of the world at that point, the blinders are just ripped off your eyes and you got to stare dead in the face of all the demons and evil you've ever done. And that's fucking hell. That's a hell that's worth no worse than any fire and brimstone cause there's no way to not look. It's like one of those horror movies where they have you, you know, your eyes pinned open and you can't not look at something terrible in front of you except you're looking back at your own life.

Speaker 2:          00:43:00       And, and I realized that, you know, all, I had a lot of anger towards Christianity at that point and I was like, this is all bullshit. I was like, wait a minute, maybe there is a heaven and hell, you know, it just doesn't involve the demons and the Sugar Candy Mountain and the bullshit. But it's a point where you're reconnected with spirit and you get to look back and reflect your life and nobody else needs a torture. You or pat you on the back, wish you to the pearly gates. That's all going to be through yourself. And that changed the fucking game forever. Why was that first experience? First experience, not just knocks it out of the park. I was up and that was, that was a really cool night for me. I was up, you know, all the stars are there were far, far away from electricity and the old dog that was in the car was um, you know, had really bad hips and they had a main, the main kind of house, Little Casa that was way warmer that a bunch of fires and things.

Speaker 2:          00:43:51       There's nice and cozy out in the year. It was, you know, much more kind of rural, not much, not much going. They've got a really blanket up and uh, I was pretty vulnerable at that point. I was out of my body or whatever and the coyote start coming in at the night and I remember that the old dog just stayed right outside my door. Never spent the night outside cause it's old arthritic dog and just stayed out there awake all night with me. You know, as I was kind of going through this stuff and it was just kind of a cool kinship. I felt probably one of the first times I felt like a real kinship with another species, like a different animal that she was high as fuck. Cling into reality. He had a rock and a dog man. And I was just on a fucking mission. And so I went back, I went back to her and did the same thing, you know, meet her in the airport, go drive across the border and then, and then go to these journeys.

Speaker 2:          00:44:41       I did several different other, you know, interesting things from that point. Uh, I snuffed, I snuffed five Meo DMT, which was a fucking wild experience. Snuffed it down in Mexico. Yup. Snuffed it. So they created, I think it was a snuff from the bufo toxin in some kind of traditional way. Uh, I'm hoping they harvested it, you know, friendly from the frog or whatever, but they created a snuff and you know, pretty much there was this like caterpillar looking at amount of powder. It was like Ruddy Brown. And um, that was, this was my second, this is my second journey. Second time down to see her. And I guess I had some kind of straw or something. I was snorting, it wasn't a rolled up Hundo it was like some kind of Straw or old kind of seed tube. And, um, and so I snuffed it. And how was my first DMT experience?

Speaker 2:          00:45:32       But of course, as you know, five Meo DMT is a much different animal. It's even stronger. Yeah, it was, it was a really incredibly personal experience. So in that experience, I went back and relived, I had a great child, I have no complaints, but my dad had a pretty savage temper and it would just build up and he would get really intimidating and start yelling at me. And I, I guess I built up some, some issues about that, you know, it's probably most kids would, I was pretty young when this would happen and it fucking put me right back in the room with one of these most intense experiences and I was reliving it and my dad was in the same place just yelling at me like, blah, blah. And all of a sudden I is that little kid like became the man that I was, I was 1920 and I was like, you're gonna fucking yell at me like that now I am.

Speaker 2:          00:46:21       Look at me now. You want to do that shit to me now? And it was turning this fear that I had had into like this standing up for myself and rage like I fucking dare you. So you went as an adult almost in relive the six completely relived it. But with the strength that I had accumulated as an adult, you know, I was doing kickboxing and I was lifting weights and you know, I was pretty, pretty athletic at that point, more so than my father. And at that point I just relived it as this, don't you fucking dare do that to me? I will. And, and there was shit, it was really heavy. Right. And I was in that fucking space the whole time. Like it wasn't like I was imagining it that was happening. Like I was in the room and there was tears.

Speaker 2:          00:47:03       And then ultimately, you know, ultimately a US kind of forgiveness, you know, where in my vision he was like, I'm so sorry. You know, it's like, I understand. And I was like, okay. And we kind of, my relationship with him since then, for the 12 years after was that like fixed a huge, huge divide between us. You know where I could say I'm a man now and I'm not scared of you. No matter, no matter what you try to do, you know, and I kind of reversed this thing that had me a little fearful. It had me feeling not like a man myself I guess because I got kind of dominated in a way by my father figure. And that was kind of the real coming of age experience for me. There was a guy at the park the other day,

Speaker 3:          00:47:45       I was with my, my kids when we were playing around. Some guys playing with his kid seems real friendly and he says, uh, hey man, uh, he's gonna you're going to be raising his hand someday about his son. Like meaning that his son is going to be an MMA fighter and I almost want to tell him like, not if you do a good job at wall. I mean it sounds fucked up, but I mean there's a few guys who had a real good parents like George Saint Pierre or John Jones still his parents come to every fight. And, I mean, I obviously, I don't know what the relationship that they had with their parents was, but there's a large percentage, a very large percentage of fighters who were beaten up and fucked with as a young kid and not just bullied by, by their kids at school, but beaten by their parents.

Speaker 3:          00:48:30       You know, child abuse. I mean there's, there's a ton of them. Yeah. Um, there's a guy who was arrested yesterday, Tiago Silva. Did you hear this story standoff with police? I didn't dig deep armed standoff with the police in Miami. A parent, I don't know the whole story, but apparently involved a woman and a, I don't know what the fuck happened. It might have involved drugs. There's a bunch of different versions of it. Obviously the dude, it was a crazy person. Whatever happened, there was allegedly some guns and allegedly some fucking, he's a murderer. It meaning they're in the cage. I mean, Taco Silva is a scary motherfucker. Fuck yeah. He comes after dudes. He's imagine that guy with no referee in a gun. Holy Jesus Christ. You know, I don't know what happened. So eat, but there's a story that someone put today on the underground about Tiago Silva's childhood.

Speaker 3:          00:49:22       Uh, the underground being mixed martial arts.com, which is one of my favorite, well my number one favorite website when it comes to what MMA. Just a, an awesome forum. Always has great up to date news. And I know the guys who run it in a very, very cool guys, but the, the actual story of him growing up, his childhood was fucking horrific. Horrific to read. I had to stop reading it. It's talking about his dad just regularly beating the fucking shit out of him and he has a big scar on his head from when he was a little boy was dad fucking opened him up. I mean, terrifying, terrifying shit. That's how you make a really scary guy. Like Thiago Silva. He make a guy who doesn't want to fucking take it anymore. He's tired of it and he learns how to stand up for himself. But along the way sometimes, you know, you can make a fucking monster can, you can make a monster with abuse.

Speaker 2:          00:50:15       Yeah, no doubt. It has, it affected me, my, one of my best friends is Roger Huerta and it's no, it's no secret his, you know, he was abused by pretty much all the female figures in his life. Pretty savagely. Yeah. And you know, it's, it certainly can contribute. And then there's, there are those people who are just meant to be the Samurai of the way, you know, the Musashi types where it just suits them. So it's either either or, you have to have this deep calling from some archetypal draw to that or there has to be something that kind of deflects you in a, in a weird way. And I wonder if I hadn't done all these different things, you know, mine wasn't that severe. As I said, I had a great fucking child. I'm very blessed. Um, but I wonder if I wouldn't have wanted to, cause I was on the borderline for doing some fighting and things like that.

Speaker 2:          00:51:03       If I hadn't gotten that out and really felt like I could assert myself fully as, as a man then in that rite of passage, maybe I would've sought it in the cage somehow. You know, maybe that would have had to fulfill that role for even me. You know, you never know like where obviously I was never destined to be a fucking champion, but maybe I'd have gone into some smokers or something, but, but you know, it's, it's interesting and the effects that that can have and really doing the heavy work, doing the heavy lifting, that sitting there talking on a couch to somebody, you know, you're not going to get there. You aren't going to see it happening and rewrite, reprogram the history in your brain. So when I look at that back now, it's not like poor me. It's, it's, I'm sorry my dad had to, you know, inflict that, that's going to be hurting him, but I'm not affected. I'm not scared by that anymore. I overcame that from, you know, from the help of this, this medicine. Yeah. The,

Speaker 3:          00:51:58       the feelings that I had when I was in high school was, the big one was I moved around a lot. And, uh, when I was in high school, I didn't really get picked on. I went to a really good school. It's a nice place. I mean everybody gets bullied a little bit. You get fucked with by people a little bit. But um, my, my zest for fighting was almost all entirely based on my childhood is based on trying to overcome any feelings of, of weakness or vulnerability that I had when I was younger. So as I got less and less vulnerable, it's my desire to fight got less and less to, it was really fascinating to especially experience in retrospect. Look back on it like, um, once I was out of the house and I wasn't living with my mom and my stepdad anymore and it was on my own and just live in like I have almost a zero aggression.

Speaker 3:          00:52:47       It was weird. It was like I wasn't in school anymore. I didn't know what he was telling me what to do anymore. I didn't have this feeling like I was going to be this a utter complete failure because I couldn't get through school without falling asleep, so fucking bored. But as I got like 19, 20, 21, then it became about this intense challenge. Then it became a much more healthy appreciation for competition because when I was 16 I just wanted to fuck people up and I met my parents actually didn't want me to do martial arts because they were terrified that I was going to become this angry kid who knew how to fuck people up. Whereas before it was just angry kid who really couldn't do anything. It wasn't, wasn't dangerous. I was, you know, and

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       then this 11 year old became 12 and the 12 year olds like, ah, I want to be like Bruce Lee. You know, like under the fuck you. No, I don't think so. You know, didn't want me having, didn't chucks. I had noon. Chuck's all the time. People are just taking shit away from me. I'd make them in the woodshop. I tell him that I was making a chair legs, fucking my chair's grab two broken legs. Funny that they look exactly like nunchucks. Mr Jason, who's the, every kid loved nunchucks. Everybody did. Of course the Bruce Lee movies, man, there were dope. Let me see him swinging around. I had a really funny story that happened there. So there was a kid, I was like seven and there was a kid, neighbor kid who was like 12 and he was big, you know, way bigger than me and he would kind of pick on me a little bit just because he was bigger.

Speaker 4:          00:54:08       But I had a bunch of older brothers so they would always keep them in line or whatever. One day he did something fucked up to me and again at seven versus 12 so they're like, Nah, we got a plan. And I had, you know, those foam nunchucks that you could get and they're like playing around. They had a hard center and foam on the outside. So I had those hidden behind my back and my brother was holding me back and he says, Ryan, go take your shots man. I'm fucking sick. I was Chris and I'm sick of Chris is bullshit. Go take your shots. And meanwhile he's holding me, Lucy and I just have these nunchucks and this guy's like, yeah, I'm going to get him an cheap shots. It goes up to punch me in the stomach and I just whip them out like fucking Bruce Lee.

Speaker 4:          00:54:41       And just go ape shit on this 12 year old kid and I remember I was like, I am fucking Bruce Lee's. Oh yeah, I could let him up up. They were hitting him. They, it was like a fucking swarm of bees. He just ran into funny. What a dumb ass. Yeah, I'm holding my brother back. Come Punch him. Yeah. I'm an asshole. Believes that the kid deserves it. He deserves it. Just that's a lesson the universe taught him. What are you fucking stupid? It's not going to hold his brother and let him let you punch him. Silly Bitch is Bruce Lee with the nun chucks and that video will go that it was fucking people up with new and trex. Bruce Lee was the inventor of the retard wagon train. It's like one guy stands in the center and they all take turns, which fucking never happens in the real world by the way folks.

Speaker 4:          00:55:33       They come at you a mass of bodies. You get Paul centrally located and that one person grabs you and you maybe get to punch one or two as they drag it to the ground and break everything on your body, stop you in new order. Fucking apple sauce pub. There's a lot of myths that I think came up from those martial arts. I started watching a little bit of that UFC documentary, that 20 years thing. That was kind of cool. This is an intense, it's fucking almost cried. I was never thought about what happened. That was pretty powerful. Yeah. When we're sitting in talking about it, and I was talking about how long I've been doing this and it's weird. Yeah. 20 fucking years and long ass time. But meanwhile, in 20 years, the 20 years of the UFC has been around 21. Now the world, the world of martial arts has evolved more than it hasn't for thousands of years. Yup. Thousands. Like

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       people know exactly what works now. I mean, there's a few weird as me, Oh, so cute. There's a few, um, like, um, techniques that are just starting to creep in. There's a few, uh, like taekwondo techniques, like you rarely, rarely see acts kicks, but occasionally someone will throw an ax kick. Uh, this guy, Ama, God, this guy has been fight in the UFC I guess is back. I must've been in taekwondo work, some karate or something, but he throws a bunch of fucking wild kicks and spinning three 60 round kicks and shit like that. And he does, he knocked guy with a three 60, we'll kick wants a in a fight. It just, what makes those viable, it seems to me is you have to be good enough at everything else before you can attempt that. If you just come in there and that's what you got and your toolkit, you gonna get taken down.

Speaker 3:          00:57:08       Yeah, you're going to get drug into fucking bad places. You got to have a good ground game and you've got to have a good takedown defense. If you don't have a good takedown defense, you got to have a good guard. It's one of the Donald Cerrone, so good [inaudible] he's like a, an expert kicker, but he also has a wicked guard. Like if you'd take him down like he fucked, haven't done them up. When they went to the ground, he caught him in a triangle and just locked it up tight. Yeah, he's triangles nasty and he likes fighting. You know, those are those, that's another good component to Donald's. Roney but that head kick now kicked that guy in the neck. Oh my God. Beautiful. Beautiful Shin to the neck. Yeah. Adriano Martine's he fucking caught them shin to the neck. Ernesto. Whose style do you just shut off, man?

Speaker 3:          00:57:47       You Shit just shuts off. Yeah, that's a, that's what he did. It was beautiful. That Shinder the neck, man. It's one of my favorite all time techniques. Mari Smith, who's a good buddy of mine, he, uh, he landed that was like one of the first head kicks in MMA. He, uh, he landed on Conan Sylvia era back in the extreme fighting. You hit him. Pretty sure he's shunned them in the neck, but uh, that Shin to the neck technique, man, it's a crazy thing that happens. Your shit shouts off. Game over. Yeah. That nerve just gets fucking bull lasted. Here's Serone and Martine's. This dude fucked. Oh, look at that. I mean that is just picture perfect. That is like, that is exactly how the technique is supposed to be thrown and exactly how it's supposed to land and exactly what happens when you get hit like that.

Speaker 3:          00:58:37       You just at night night. Donald was cool too about that. He didn't, didn't try to throw another one in there. Yeah, he could have easily uncorked that punch. He's very aware. Well, he's so aware also because he fight so often. I mean, he fought four times last year and you know when you fight that much, you're much more present. That's the thing about fighting is the more often you get in fights, the more relaxed you'll get when you're actually fighting, the more you could fight up to your ability. That's why a big layoff when people talk about ring rust is not just like when they talk about what it, what is ring rust, what is octagon rust, whatever it, what is it? Well, what it is is you've got to get comfortable with that crazy experience. You've got to have that experience really close to you. I go like one of my best fights ever was a, I won this a US Open Tournament

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       and I are, I want it because I had fought the week before. I fought in a tournament the week before and I injured my groin and I thought I was done for like, I was like, I can't compete in this New Hampshire tournament because I'm just too fucked up. Like my, my groin is really fucked up. But Saturday morning, the day of the tournament, I always got up early cause I delivered newspapers and I was delivering newspapers like five o'clock in the morning and I was like, I'm going to fucking fight. Like I feel good. I was really a caffeine and sugar buzz that made me fight because I ate a bunch of donuts. I had fucking terrible diet back then, but I ate a bunch of, I burned off so many calories. I had like four and a half percent body fat, like no bullshit, four and a half percent body fat.

Speaker 4:          01:00:01       And I was competing and um, I um, I ate a couple of doughnuts and drank a couple of dump of cup. I drank a full cup of a Dunkin donuts coffee and these two donuts, I'll never forget it. It was a Boston cream donut and one of those lemon cream ones, lemon custard ones where it's covered in white powdered sugar filled donut. You know, I was reliant on sugar and I was like, I'm going to go to New Hampshire and fuck some people up. But the reason why I fought so good, I'm pretty sure it was that I had just fought seven days ago. So it's like that, that experience was still fresh in my mind. I just gotten through a whole tournament seven days ago and one, so I was like going to this tournament, I was like so used to fighting. It was, it was like, it was last week's activity and he, we're going to do it again this week, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:00:44       But when I, one time I tore a muscle and I had to take a long time off. I didn't fight for like six months. That was the longest probably ever. And I remember when going back to fight again, I was like, do don't even know what the fuck I'm doing. And like, am I gonna freeze up out here? Like this is, this is kind of scary. Well, the mind gets engaged in me. That's exactly what you don't want care if that takes you out of the present moment, you know? I think that's the key for all of these. All of these sports, any fucking sport, you know, you just got gotta release the mind and the thinking about pass, pass things, future things. You have your game plan, you know that going in and then just let it go. That's one aspect of it. But there's, the other aspect is technique and skill and endurance and training and disciplines.

Speaker 4:          01:01:24       If you don't have that, they're equally important because you could be, you could think you're a bad motherfucker and be like totally in the zone and completely neutral in Zen. But if you're a white belt, Marcella Garcia is going to fucking strangle you. Okay? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what's going through your head. Oh, you know, dude, I'm different than other people. I'm in the zone. I'm, I'm completely tuned the best of your ability, but that may not cover the distance between the worst of someone else's ability. And you could catch someone thinking about, you know, a girl that just cheated on him and now I'm fucked in the head. It's going to be so angry with, while playing at the worst of his ability to still smoke, only so much you could do [inaudible] still going to break your arm. Heidrick gracefully is still gonna choke you. It asleep. It's just you're not good enough. You have to be good enough. And those other things, which is one of the things that's so beautiful about MMA or about Jujitsu or any martial arts, kickboxing is it's so hard to get really good.

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       It's so hard. There's so many things involved. It has to be a list of things have to be in order for you to win championships. If you, you know, if you get to be a UFC champion, you get to be a Chris Weidman, you get to be a Jon Jones. So many things have to be in order for you to get to be that good, your mind, your body life experiences, the will to win the discipline is show up at the gym, the intelligence night, eat shitty food. All these, fuck, I told you about winning the u s open after you told us drinking coffee. I was young, I was 19 or 20 I was, yeah, you get away with a lot when you're not really young, but the, the, the list of things that have to be in perfect order for you to become great and anything. That's why it's so fun to pursue greatness or so enriching to pursue it. And even if it's just personal greatness, you know, it doesn't, you don't have to be the greatest in the world at anything, but if you personally improve at something, whether it's fucking playing tennis or anything, but there was a writing books as humans

Speaker 2:          01:03:26       prove we were talking about it right before this podcast. It doesn't matter what master you meet, it can be a master of anything. We were using the context of this bow hunter, Cameron Hanes. Yeah, they're just awesome. To be around. I don't give a fuck cause I'm meeting a ton of them with on it now. It's one of the great things that I love about it is these excellent people are coming out of the woodwork saying, Hey, I was fucking excellent and I know what's good and I like your stuff. It's awesome. It makes me even better and that's awesome for me. But what's even better is spending time with these people. And it's been, it's such a divergent of mount of skills, but it's all really the same person deep down. Just applying that, that methodology, you know, as your favorite quote is, you know, no the way broadly, and you'll see it in all things. It doesn't matter what your art is, but it gets you to a place where you're a fucking cool person to hang around with.

Speaker 3:          01:04:12       Yeah. All those dudes are the same guy. They're the same guy in different forms, the same girl, the same woman in different forms. It's people that figure out how to get through this crazy maze of life and uh, come out with something and they're real. There's this, the real masters. There's a real confidence, then there's something to them. There's this does present energy. They're not bullshitting you there. They're just there, you know, just, just fucking there. You know? And this Cameron Hanes guy was totally like that and it's cool as fuck.

Speaker 2:          01:04:43       Yeah. Yeah. You've gone to the edge of the, of your own darkness because you have to, you have to go past that to be really excellent because you have to work your way through it and you have that constant resistance. Resistance is always coming up and pushing. You know, as Steven Pressfield said when we were here, anytime you go from the lower to the higher resistance is going and the journey to mastery is, that's all it is, is a journey from lower to higher. So every fucking plateau you're battling resistance and having to overcome it to transcend to the next plateau. So that skill level and being able to do that applies to the rest of your life. And it doesn't matter if it's a retired 70 year old, used to be a master at something, they still have that fucking quality inside of him.

Speaker 3:          01:05:25       Yeah. And I'm going to read this email that Cameron sent me today. Uh, someone sent him, I won't reveal the guy's name cause I'm sure he wanted it private, but he said that, watch you on the Joe Rogan experience. You're a, you're an inspiration. Seeing your approach and philosophy checks off so many boxes with me. Seeing someone work hard at something meaningful to them is wonderful. Even if I never hunt the idea that I can say, you know what, I want to push this area of my life to the next level. Can I be in better shape for this or better mental condition? And that this doesn't have to apply to things like winning the Olympic gold, but just to be better at surfing or hunting, juggling, it doesn't matter. And he said, thanks man. I liked that he got an email. Yeah. It got, he got that inspiration.

Speaker 3:          01:06:08       He got that charge. Yup. And that's what I was saying to Cameron on the podcast yesterday is that I got that from him. I got that from watching his videos. I got, first of all, um, his positivity, he's like this really smiley friendly guy who does like really nice things. Like he auctioned off his bow and gave the money to some guy who was battling cancer and you know, made this really thankful video about it. Like his energy is pure. Like you can see it when he's communicating and he's a fucking fiend. The guys workout maniac, he's, the guy's an animal, he's a savage, he's out there fucking shooting pointy sticks at elk and when you're hanging out with them, couldn't be cooler. So it's like the, you, you, when you were around enough of those people, you start absorbing a higher ideal. And I think that we oftentimes we imitate the people that were around. We imitate our atmosphere to a certain extent, or at very least it sets a watermark. And, but you meet people like this, Cameron Hanes guy or hundreds of other people that have had on this podcast, it sets a higher watermark. It gives you more to aspire.

Speaker 2:          01:07:11       I agree completely. I, you know, I made a post on my Facebook page that, you know, I said something like a encouraging, that same thing, you know, changing, changing your friends, deciding who you want to hang out with and, and trying to hang out with these people that really inspire you and you know, so then there was this backlash of people saying, you know, some people say, no man, you're perfect just the way you are. You shouldn't try to be anything different. And I was like, well, I kind of get what you're saying, but to, on order to hang out with other people that inspire you, you can't just be like, I am what I am, Bro. I'm not going to fucking try it. And you gotta be in the same path, you know, to connect with them, to really be someone that they want to hang out with.

Speaker 2:          01:07:51       You gotta be pushing yourself to, and that's, that's part of the process because they're going to see that, you know, if you haven't gone out and actively faced your own demons, that'll be nice. That'll shake your hand and whatever, but they're not calling you out for beers in a game of pool on Saturday. You know, they got other people that inspire them that they want to be around and make them feel alive from that same kind of energy and connection. And you know, I think it's, it's important. Yes. You know, some parts of us are perfect as they are, but nonetheless, that pursuit of excellence is going to put you in the class with other people who were on the same pursuit. You know, water finds its level.

Speaker 3:          01:08:27       Yeah. It's an old expression game recognizes game. Yep. That's, it does. People who are real, they, you know, I don't like using that expression. People who are real because there's so many fucking abuses of that word. Real keeping it real, keeping it real. Um, but those people that are present, people that are legitimately who they are projecting their not putting on an act. When you meet someone who is putting on an act, God, it's glaring. It's a sore thumb. It's just throb, throb, throb. Just do shyness and Gross Nis and kept me away from this fucking idiot and just catching a little lie here and they're catching a little, you know, just a little exaggeration, a little distortion, a little song. That shit is bad for you. It's bad for you to be around. You can catch that. Just like and catch a cold. You know, you can catch distortion, lower your standards. It'll slowly chip away. If you lived in prison and you were surrounded by liars and thieves and murderers, like you were in the worst prison ever. Everyone was guilty. No one was set up. No one had a bad childhood. It's just content. Just the prison con, con penitentiary. You know, your idea of what human beings are would drop.

Speaker 2:          01:09:38       Well, it happens. The cops all the time, you know, cops are dealing with the worst of humanity on a regular basis. So they sometimes suspect, and I say this because my Stepdad was on the swat team and he was a cop. It was a kimono. And so they see the worst in people so often that it taints their glasses are a little ruddy black. You know, I mean they're seeing the worst in everybody just cause that's what they're conditioned to do.

Speaker 3:          01:10:02       Yeah. They also have some of the best sense of humor. I have some friends that are cops, cops know that I know from a martial arts or whatever and the order of deals, this dark sense of humor man. Cause they just see, you know, oh we showed up and this lady's head was in the middle of the road and yeah. Oh Jesus,

Speaker 2:          01:10:17       what else do you do? But you have to be able to blow off and laugh and

Speaker 3:          01:10:21       yeah. And then keep it light. Be Really Weird about it because you know when you see something like a horrible car accident and you see them every day over and over again and then you get in your car, okay here we go. No I'm going to enter into this thing. That also is shit. You know, I saw what happens when everything goes wrong earlier today, but now I'm just going to go about my, I mean they, and they see it every day. I mean every, most likely, you know, most days they're going to see something fucked up. Especially if you're in La, you know, if you're a cop in La, Jesus Christ, what the fuck did those guys see every day?

Speaker 2:          01:10:55       That's why I kind of, from the cops that I've interacted with, the more heavy shit that goes on in the neighborhood, usually the cooler the cop is when they pull you over for something stupid. You know, it's like the cop, if you get caught in a really neighborhood but not shit happens and you're going five miles over the speed and then there'll be a deck, a lot of time, you know, if you're in a place

Speaker 4:          01:11:13       where they're checking on murders and risking their life and whatever, I'm like, oh cool, you turn the Dome light on and you're giving me your stuff. All right, cool man. Uh, just slow down, you know, just got to keep it safe out here and they'll let you off, you know? Whereas the other cops are just like, oh, look at you because they're fucking calibration is off. Obviously generalization, but I tend to see that it's hard to be a cop man really is. And people get mad at me on this podcast for defining defending cops. You know, I had a cub fucking shoot my dog. They were looking for weed. I know of her, those stories. I've seen the videos. I know there's cops that that happens. There's definitely cops are cons. But I just think overall it's an insanely hard job that gets zero reward and it builds up a resentment.

Speaker 4:          01:11:57       And you know, human beings don't like being resented. They don't like being, they don't like that feeling of resentment. They don't like resenting people that they don't like the animosity. They just don't. We were not designed to absorb animosity. Well, and you know that animosity that cops receive and when every good person generally looks at you and says, oh, fuck the fucking cops. Because you're always just buzzkill in whatever they're doing. They're putting in a terrible spot. Having to defend these we'd laws and psychedelic laws. And you know, even some of the alcohol laws, you know, for a 20 year old, he wants to fucking drink some beers in his house or whatever, quotas, ticket quotas, all the, all of these [inaudible] things they have to do, you know, causes people to despise. Imagine if none of those laws existed and cops were only there for the stuff that you really wanted them.

Speaker 4:          01:12:44       Therefore people would love the cost for like, oh fucking sweet rate cops are here. And murder rate, fee, fee, fee, fee delivery. Yeah. Yeah. You'd be pumped and be like, yes, the cops are here. Awesome there around. I love it when the cops are around, but because they have to enforce these terrible laws that you know are bullshit and it just fucking up your day, you know, raising revenue or even worse trying to bust you for exploring your own consciousness. You kind of fucking hate him and resent them. You know, we could do that would crush almost every police department all across the country. Everybody just drive the speed limit and obey all traffic laws. They would, it would destroy them because they're so used to pulling in x amount of money per month that if we could go a few months, just a few months of no track traffic stops ever.

Speaker 4:          01:13:33       People literally they would, they would just start false flagging people. Yeah, they would, they would have to, they would start, they would go after you and they would set up a fake crime and then arrest you for it. Sort of like the war on drugs, sort of like, you know, the DEA would do, I mean, what would they do if everybody stops on wheat? They would find retards and talked him into selling them weed and then arrest them. That's what they would do if everybody just totally stopped selling weed with the DEA. Go out of business the fuck it would if all these Mexican drug cartel said, listen man, you know, we did some Iowasca and we've got a different point of view and man, it's not cool to harm people. So, uh, look, we made a lot of money. We're good, we're done. We're just getting out of the business. We're not selling anymore. We, and then everyone

Speaker 3:          01:14:11       in America said, you know what, man? Um, grow your own weed. I'm not selling any weed. That's it. We're done. It was no one else to bus. No one is selling weed. There's no one to bust. What would they do? They would set people up, man. They would, they would keep their job. There's an organism would preserve its identity and it would preserve its life. It would preserve its existence and the only way to serve the existing, you've got arrest motherfuckers. Yeah. If we didn't have any traffic violations at all for a few months, it would bankrupt most police departments. Isn't that insane? Like they're dependent on crime. It least this petty crime of parking. Sure. And speeding and not stopping and done. These private prisons would start to crumble if, you know, you took away all of the inmates were there for these drug charges, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:14:57       So yeah. And that's, that was a good point. There's a documentary of the house I live in and they make a great, you know, a great case for that. How all these private prison systems need to throw these people in prison at these overwhelmingly level high levels compared to the rest of the world is they're surviving like an organism, like all these other countries, you know, big corporations, they're like an organism that's going to survive at fucking any costs. Yeah, and it doesn't have to be like that. You don't have to be that type of organism, but it requires some consciousness at the fucking brain of the organism to make sure that it's not well and it's so blatant to when you find out that these people that need these jobs lobby to make sure that these jobs are in place and the way they do that is to make sure the things are illegal so they can arrest people like the policemen's, the the guards, the prison guards union, they, they make sure that they spend money to make sure the drugs stay illegal.

Speaker 3:          01:15:51       Like they work actively, they spend money on making sure that marijuana is legal, like, well who would do that? Who would do that based on the facts in hand? Someone who profits from that. Right. Some of the profits from drugs being illegal and the way they profit is more people get arrested and then they keep their job as a prison guard. That is slavery, no matter how you slice it. That is it. Just a tricky way of being a slave master. What you're doing is you're figuring out this real sneaky way to enforce slavery and it, but just not slavery. It's a choice. You don't want to follow the law. Shut up stupid. Shut your fucking internal dialogue right now because the law is just some shit that people wrote down. Nobody wants marijuana to be illegal, but idiots. No one. When you look at the actual facts behind it, if you can't argue the facts, then it's, there's no conversation.

Speaker 3:          01:16:41       And when the LD 50 which is a lethal dose at 50% meaning if there's 20 of us, we all take the same amount, half of us would be dead. What's that number? 1500 pounds in 15 minutes. Okay, we're done here, right? We're done here. You don't have to worry about that. Okay, let's what else he got? Draino people would drink a drain though. Yeah. Don't do that. Okay. Yeah, let's make that not cool. You can't sell draino drinks. Fuck is wrong with people. But the idea that someone would lobby to keep marijuana illegal, that's what we see. How laws and things that are written down on paper can really fuck with people because it becomes doctrine. It becomes law. It becomes what it becomes is this rigid thing that can't be worked around. It doesn't have any flexibility. There's no gray area. It is this, or is that,

Speaker 2:          01:17:33       and you ended up with this, this almost doctrine that's based on some, it's like faith. It's like a new religion. You know? It's like saying that you know the urges to have sex inside you or masturbate or evil and you need to go to the church. Okay? You made something that fucking makes sure that everybody feels guilty and everybody needs a priest because everybody's going to want to touch their genitals. So you just figured something out of way to fucking hack the system so that you get everybody in some form of psychic or mental slavery. And in the prison system. I've never heard that analogy, but you're fucking absolutely right. It's like you're enslaving them for your own profit. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:18:11       Actively making sure that people are in jail. They're making sure that there's laws in place that will ensure that more people will get arrested. You know, there's a movement and the movement is, well, there's ethical considerations when it comes to private prisons and laws and also laws where there's no victim victims. Fucking victim. I need a job. I need to keep my family fat to work we've got to do is we're going to lobby to make sure drugs are legal, drugs are bad for families, and so they have this rhetoric and this rhetoric fuels the debate and the laws get passed or the congressmen gets greased or whatever the fuck happens. And then the laws stay the same or even tightened down. In some cases, more people go to jail and these fat cats profit, which is so strange because it's, it's as easily definable as slavery, as anything that's ever been.

Speaker 2:          01:19:05       You look at, yeah, you look at it, I can't help but draw the parallels. You know, to religion. So religion, you get tired or whatever. You get pap to pay 10% or whatever the fuck I'm out. So you're paying for the church always from the bar, and then you look at the means that they went to make sure that everybody escribed well burning people at a stake who didn't believe. That's a pretty good way to ensure that you're going to get 10% of that person's money. And then making sure that they're guilty always 24 fucking seven because you've made the urge to have sex, which is like the urge to eat or take a dump. It's not going to go away. You made that as sin and the only way to absolve it is to get the priest. Well, yeah. All right, you're going to make a fucking lot of money doing that. You know what? Whereas if the priests were cool and you know, maybe as if Jesus's teachings were intended and we're like, hey, you can find this anywhere you want. You got to look inside. You find the truth about God inside yourself and through love and through all of these things, you know, people would be like, hey, thanks brother, and they are not going to give you 10% and let you do all this crazy shit. You know, it's just manipulation, manipulation

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       for profit. Well, that's, I think the good churches, uh, probably do 10% that the band churches pass around baskets and they're constantly begging and asking for. I mean, who knows? What do you remember when, who is a fucking that preacher? Was it Benny Hinn that had a rolls Royce and he said they'd go, God wanted them to drive a Rolls Royce. It doesn't surprise me one of those motherfuckers, but I'm like, that is so bold. God wanted you to drive a Rolls Royce. They just bad. They just made shit up. I mean, I was, I was going looking at a horrible experience going into a dungeon of the inquisition, right? Italy, boy, darkest, one of the darkest places I've ever seen. It's up. Even the fucking ideas involved in some of these things and how many of them involved? You're fucking penis in your vagina was shocking. Like 30% of the tortures involve that.

Speaker 3:          01:20:57       And if they didn't want to do that, then rape was a way to get cast the devils out and punish people as well. So you, if you are a priest and an inquisitor, you could rape someone in order to get it out after you tortured and mutilated their genitals. Okay, that sounds pretty good. That's a holy path. And even 2000 jobs, I mean there's parts of Africa where people are regularly burned to death for being witches and there's a bunch of videos of it online of people convincing people that there witches are there. Someone is bewitched, a spell was cast under them and families are literally selling everything they have and forcing himself into indentured servant to, to pay for which doctor to cure their children of being witches. It's a serious, serious issue that they have over there. And 2014 this day and age, it's ideologies, man.

Speaker 3:          01:21:48       Ideologies and beliefs are incredibly strong things and it's so easy to manipulate people because we don't know. We, we literally, all of us, the giant mass of us have no idea what the fuck is going on. You know as much about what life is all about is anyone who's ever lived ever. And that's really hard for people to swallow. So when we come along, someone that claims to know something, they take the place of where our parents were when we were children. When you were a child and you knew almost nothing, your parents knew more than you, so you could go to them and they steered you. Right? And that's how you got to be alive today. And the more fear that you lived with growing up, the more readily you accept that position, the more terrified you're being insecure you'll be you. You have not found personal sovereignty.

Speaker 3:          01:22:34       So all of a sudden religion comes along and fills up this spot where your daddy used to be. Well, your mommy used to be. And religion tells you. And I don't mean just any religion, I mean witchcraft. I mean everything. Scientology fill in the blank, you name it. No one has the answers. So when someone comes along and they tell you not only that they have the answers, but that they need your money and they need a lot of it and they need, they have to, you got to behave in very specific ways that don't make any sense. Like don't jerk off. Yeah. You know, the only thing that can count on is stuff that you can reliably find out yourself. Any great spiritual teacher is going to basically send you on your own quest for knowledge and then let you come up with your own truth.

Speaker 3:          01:23:16       Because if it's not reproducible by yourself, it's probably bullshit. Yeah. You know, if you can't get there doing a psychedelic meditating going in the tank, trying to actually pursue this quest for knowledge and you can't come to that conclusion, I say most likely you should discard it. If someone's just trying to force feed it down your brain, it should be reproducible. You should be able to get there. If you try, it's also an interactive experience. You know? It's not like you, someone gives you information and then boom, you're a better person now. You have to be like on a quest to be a better person, someone has to say something that resonates with you. You have to be able to internalize what they're saying. You have to be able to analyze what they're saying. You have to be able absorb what they're saying. You have to think about your own life and a lot of, we've got to do a lot of work.

Speaker 3:          01:23:58       It's not as simple as someone tells you what's up and then you know, because if that's almost like winning the lottery, it's like, you know, all of a sudden you have this money. Okay, now what? Well, you got to spend it. You're fucking crazy. You didn't earn that shit. You don't know how he got there. If somebody gives you the perfect knowledge, it's going to be like, wow, that totally makes sense. And then off to off to do heroine. No. Well, yeah man, I couldn't help myself just fucking, I just need that crack. Yeah, it's not real. It doesn't have value. You gotta be searching. You gotta be searching to clean up your own life. That's one of the things they say about people when it comes to getting clean. People that are, they're abusing drugs or alcohol, getting clean and sober, like you have to hit your rock bottom where you realize you got to do something about your life until you realize it, all the people in the world telling you to get your shit together, it's not going to matter.

Speaker 3:          01:24:45       It doesn't mean anything. You're just going to, you're going to placate them. You know what, man, you're right. I'm done, man. I'm done. Done fucking use, man. I'm done. Meanwhile, as soon as you get away from them, you're calling up your dealer. You know, Eddie, Eddie Bravo had, um, uh, an ex that had a meth problem and he didn't know about it and he found out about it because, uh, I think he, he was like, he, she didn't know he was home or something like that and he was listening to a phone call and he couldn't fucking believe it. Like, I think, I think that was what happened. But like when he listened to it, he was like, Holy Shit. Like living with this check had no idea she was doing meth and then he leaves and she's like, yeah, what do you got? You know I need, I need to get some, I need to get high.

Speaker 3:          01:25:27       Like right now I got, you know, like what he got like and he was like, whoa. And then he sort of figured it out and then confronted her but didn't know, had no idea. And you know, tell her, hey, you know, you gotta stop doing this. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I'm fucking done. Done with that shit cause he gone. Okay, good. I need to get some fucking math right now. Okay. Not yesterday and then an hour. I need it now. And if till that person says, Hey, I got to stop doing meth. I don't want to be this person, um, I've fucking, I'm going to test my will. I'm going to change my life. I'm going to steer this battleship. I'm going to figure out a way off the rocks until that person makes that decision, no movement's going to take place. You'll, that's why I fucking hate talking with people when they start talking to me about losing weight and um, you know, but just I think in wanting me to do is just drop, you know, I just, I guess a, I see it late at night at, hey, just fucking do it man.

Speaker 3:          01:26:19       Just stop. Don't talk to me because you're just jerking off of my face. That's what you do. And this is a form of mental masturbation. You know, you're, you're, I, I, I get it. You're trying to look for inspiration. You, you got to find it in inside of you. We can have these conversations once, but if we have them twice and then three times and then four times and then I don't see you for six months and you're fatter, you can go fuck yourself. Okay, I'm done. And not going to keep doing this, man. I'm not going to keep doing this. You know what you gotta do what? You got to find something, and I don't know if freewill is real because there's the, there's the big philosophical debate is there a freewill isn't every decision you make based on a variety of things and include genetics, epigenetics, life experiences.

Speaker 3:          01:27:01       You know what path you'd going left as opposed to going, right? What happened to you before you had any control over your life when you were a baby, your whole personality is formed by the time we were two. Well then you start factoring on the getting to that sort of philosophical debate. That's all good in the hood. That's all cool in the gang. But I know for a fact that some people change, so either you're going to be one of those motherfuckers, it changes or you're not going to be one of those motherfuckers that's changes. You can get philosophical all day long. Say there is no freewill and you know I'm not going to do it because there's no free will and hey, I'm just happy being a way to let yourself off the hook. It's exactly what it is. You're being a bitch and I'm here to let you know. That's what I'm here for. I'm the, I'm the being a bitch. You're being a bitch police.

Speaker 2:          01:27:41       I'm here to let you know I think William James Cause I was you know, study a lot of philosophy and his take on the freewill argument was one of my favorites and it's like I dunno if there is free will or not but my life is a hell of a lot better if I believe it is true. You know and I'm going to be fucking making decisions for myself that are going to benefit my life and I'm going to act sure as shit as if there is free will cause this, watch me, you know and that was it. It was like whatever you guys, philosophers want to argue about, fine. That's cool. Good for you. But I'd say that there is just because it's better for me and I'm going to fucking make shit happen. I know there is

Speaker 3:          01:28:14       no, I know there is alarm clocks bitch. It's that fucking simple. I exercise my will and determination with alarm clocks because when alarm clocks go off, I fucking get up and I get up. Not just because of all the newer new free does just just what I do. No, I do it on purpose. I know I do it. I know it's hard to do. I know, I know I do that and I could just shut it off. You know, I could just fucking shut it off, but unplugged the phone in the hotel and sleep for a couple of days or I want to do, I'll fucking call everybody in a few days. They'll be fine, they'll freak out a little bit. But if I want to do that, I'll do it. That, yeah, you can do it. Do whatever the fuck you want to do. Man.

Speaker 2:          01:28:55       I know, I know in a different way. And that's just from my own experiences of being, of separating myself from that aton you know, that robotic mind and just becoming that higher part of yourself and that that is the part of you that really does have free will. You know, there's this higher consciousness that can stop everything. Just say the whole thing. [inaudible] throw the fucking brakes on and then make some decisions. You know, and maybe there's winds that blow influences currents that are gonna shape different ideas of thought. But man, when you're in that state and you can really feel connected to that, to that person driving your ship, you know that tree will cause you can fucking feel it.

Speaker 3:          01:29:36       There's something you can decide to be a better person. Yeah, you absolutely can. People had been doing it from the beginning of time. You can better yourself. And that's one of the reasons why inspirational people are so important because you can make choices based on inspiration that is freewill defined the thing we were talking about, about being inspired by people, surrounding yourself with positive people and using that positivity to reinforce your own life and inspire your own life. That is free will. That is freewill, broken down to its most beneficial aspect. The most beneficial aspect of freewill is the ability to choose to better yourself, to be influenced by positive things where there was love or whatever it is. Well it would have those things didn't happen. And you don't, you wouldn't have free will because of free will. It's just you reacting to your environment.

Speaker 3:          01:30:22       Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everybody says that's weak by the way. You ever notice that it's not a bunch of fucking savage champions. Yeah. That, that don't believe in freewill. Now they all tell you, you have to test your will. You have to test it. You know, and and, and people who've never truly tested there will be never truly tried to run up that mountain with that 130 pound rock on your back. If you never really tried to do Jujitsu and tried to do battle with another skilled person for 20 fucking minutes where you're both your hearts ready to explode and your chest and your fucking arms made out of rubber, you don't know. You don't know about pushing yourself. You don't, you don't. You haven't, you haven't really tested yourself. You've just gotten in your car and driven to your cubicle every day and put in your hours and then you want to talk shit.

Speaker 3:          01:31:04       All right? But that's not how life works. The way life works is you get your shit talking license when you accomplish something. And Ironically speaking, once you've accomplished something, you're least likely to want to talk shit. That's it. That's the irony of it all. But then by talking shit, I mean bragging and, and, and mean. And there is, there's recanting and re recounting rather recounting special experiences, um, that are fascinating. Whether I love talking to martial artists that talk about the greatest victories I love talking to. And it doesn't, that doesn't mean they're bragging. It doesn't mean not, don't talk about accomplishments, but most people know the difference between enacting and react reenacting experiences and pulling their lessons out of those experiences. And people who are just trying to pump themselves up. And when you're around someone who's just trying to pump themselves up and they, they're bullshitting and it's, it's a gross oily, feeling it from a need

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       deep inside to fill up some void. They fill in their own, in their own mind and their own ego and their own mindset. So that need requires positive reinforcement from other people, but that's going to be a vacuous hole that they're never going to fill. And so unless they've already conquered that, they're not going to be that good. Like you have to get past that to really be, you know, one of the true masters in nuts. There's a rare occasion where, you know, as we said before, someone's raw ability is just so unbelievably savage on another level that they do get to be ostensibly a champion. You know, without actually having gone through it. I'm sure there are cases of that where someone is just so fucking gifted that they've gotten away with not actually facing the demons on the journey, but that's super rare and I've never encountered,

Speaker 3:          01:32:45       I think in certain, um, fight sports, it's actually possible to get incredibly proficient and not be a true master of yourself. Mike Tyson, I think is one of the greatest examples ever. Mike Tyson has come out and said that he was on coke through a great part of his career. Like he was doing coke and fighting. I mean, and he was cool, literally out of control. Whether or not he raped that Desiree woman who was accused of raping. I don't know. I wasn't there, but whatever that was, you have to take into consideration a couple of things. Would that particular case, one, she had falsely accused, I'm going to rape just a year before. Sure. That's one. And you know too, she took her panties shield off when she got into the bathroom. Those, those, both of those things don't look so good for her. It doesn't mean that she didn't say no and he didn't rape her.

Speaker 3:          01:33:33       Okay, so who knows what actually did happen, but take away that one experience and just look at all the crazy shit that guy did. He was a maniac. He was buying Bentleys and Rolls Royces every day and Punched Mick Green, Mitch Mitch, Blood Green at a fucking Harlem Haberdashery at two o'clock in the morning and he wasn't living like some fucking stoic monk. You saw that show that he did. He put on. I see it. It's pretty good. I heard. It's amazing. It's awesome. My point is he was the baddest motherfucker of all time while he was doing all this craziness. But the thing that he did do is insane amounts of work, insane intensity, insane focus and determination and a deep, deep, deep knowledge of his craft. A huge knowledge. I mean the reason why he had that high top fade, we shave the sides of his head cause that's what Jack Dempsey did.

Speaker 3:          01:34:22       He watched Jack Dempsey from the time he was a fucking child, like constantly imitated and mimic the movements of Jack Dempsey gotten much better in my opinion. He's way better than Jack Dempsey. When you watched Jack Dempsey move around and see if we can pull that up. Jamie, pull up a video of Jack Dempsey. Is this a, a perfect example of how someone can be inspired by someone who sucks compared to them? You know, because because Tyson was just this spring loaded like took a piece of metal and you're just fucking bent it back. Well he was, he was boxing when it hit this new incredible level where so many things were involved. First of all, there was decades and decades and decades, over a hundred years of knowledge when it came to, you know, what was effective, what was not effective is this, this is not a fight. This isn't like sparring.

Speaker 3:          01:35:13       A lot of pieces. A fight must be, well a lot of people would get to watch that guy train. Yeah, that's a fight. That's definitely a fight. Jack Dempsey was a fucking animal looking at various, it's wailing on this motherfucker kind of punches like Badr Hari does know everything showing you everything trying to crush you. He was a hard hit and motherfucker to Jack Dempsey, Mike Tyson. Oh Jesus. And they hovered over you back then after they knocked you down. That look up bloody. That dude is oh shit son back then when they, um, when they knocked you down, they stood over you and every time you got up they'd punch you again. No Way. Yeah. They watched, she hovers over him. There was no standing eight counts back then they would drop you and then when you would get on one knee and as soon as you need to lift, lifted off the ground, they fucking punch you in the face again, which it sounds gangster.

Speaker 3:          01:36:04       But look at MMA and I, you go to the ground, I fucking mount your face, punch you into oblivion. And that's a way crazier. So it's funny that people are like, no way they punched him in the head while they were down. Yeah, they, they, they hovered over you. You do you, what do you think about the idea that if they just took off all the gloves, it could be safe as far as to be wasted? It's pretty, pretty scientifically clear right now. Pull up Mike Tyson versus Marvis Frazier. This is a, in my opinion, the best version of a, of Mike Tyson, the scariest version of Mike Tyson. When Mike Tyson fought Marvis Frazier. It was when he was on his way to the heavyweight title and he had not been defeated Trevor Berbick yet, but he was on his way. But, uh, just pull it, pull it up so he could just see the fight.

Speaker 3:          01:36:48       Cause the fight only lasts for about fucking 10 seconds. But he swarms that motherfucker in a way that to this day is the most terrifying beating I've ever seen anybody give anybody inside a boxing ring because Marvis Frazier had zero chance. He wasn't a hungry, evil fighter. He was the son of one of the greatest of all time. It didn't really have it himself. And he was fighting a guy who was going to be the greatest heavyweight of all time in his greatest time when he's surging and coming up looking for a shot at the title and he just corners Marvis Frazier here and just on fucking loads, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang. Every punch is perfect. Massive amounts of torque and muscle by an every fist to his face. And he, that one combination puts Marvis Frazier out of boxing for the rest of his life. I mean he, I think he boxed again after that, but he was a shadow of himself.

Speaker 3:          01:37:43       Everyone knew he was never going to be the heavyweight champion and he was never going to be able to beat this fucking monster. I mean, he, he didn't offer any resistance whatsoever. And look at these combinations, how he is so accurate. So that's way better than Jack Dempsey. See My, my point, he's like, you look at Jack Dempsey who inspired Mike Tyson and Mike Tyson is fucking way better than Jack Dempsey. I mean way, way, way, way, way better. Sam Kennison was inspired by Lenny Bruce, but if you watch Lenny Bruce and watched Sam Kennison, he'd go, oh Jesus Christ. Like Lenny Bruce, if, if you like trying to watch it today as a 2014 comedian, like if he was a guy like, this is a guy I heard about, his name is Lenny Bruce. He'd be like, Oh my God, this guy's boring. He's so boring. He's saying the obvious shit. It wasn't obvious shit in 1950 1950 he was fucking crazy, groundbreaking stuff. I mean he was saying things that nobody had ever even thought you would hear on stage before he was and he was going to jail for them and that guy went to jail countless times just for profanity, just for just speaking his mind and and talking about the, the, the, the language that we use. I mean he would use profanity in talking about how odd it is that we have these restrictions on language.

Speaker 2:          01:38:56       Sure. You hear so many people talk about how they're building off the backs of the giants from, from times ago, you know, from whatever, whatever, whatever it is in science, in art and in sport and all of that. You know, you build off of what created before and make it generally, you know, better. You get to take what they knew and the best people do is take what they knew, take how far they went, and then take it even farther, you know, and then, then you think about some things like you look at Graham Hancock's work and then you wonder, well what happens if everything just gets fucking taken away and you have to start over. What if all the UFC tapes completely went out of people's consciousness? This whole generation, it's only 25 years and this generation gets wiped out. A new one comes up. They've got to figure that shit out all over again and they're going to suck for a long time. A long time, you know, because they're not going to have that, that to build off of. Whereas now, you know, people are just going to get more and more efficient and and capable at this art.

Speaker 3:          01:39:55       Yeah. If people had to figure out how to do a wheel kick from scratch, oh yeah. And land it spin and hit someone in the head with your head,

Speaker 2:          01:40:03       it would take forever for them to even think of it, you know? Yeah. I mean, it'll take a long time.

Speaker 3:          01:40:09       Oh, do you? The idea that you could kick someone in the face, you could pick up your leg and kick someone in the face. Like what? No, you can kick them when they're down and kick them when they're up here. Get outta here. That's not even fucking possible. And then he showed the Jonelle Serone video and you're like, get the fuck outta here. How did he figure that out? He fucking hit him with his shin. Whoa. And people who don't do martial arts sometimes a, um, I have friends that have come to the UFC and they have no idea what he did to the guy like a Steve Rinella. This guy was a, this guy, um, uh, a bag routine off was a fighting this dude who was going for, uh, the John, John Linacre, John Leonard who was going for a leg lock on bog routine. Often it was at the end of the fight, but off his is sambal master and Linacre is more of a striker than anything is Jujitsu sort of.

Speaker 3:          01:40:58       So, so and so boggled teen off was like laughing that this guy was trying to heal, hook them, waved his fingers. So he stood up, he standing there while Linacre is going after his legs, not even defending the leg lock. And he's like going like this, like standing there and flexing. And it's ridiculous because you know like, and so my friend was like, how did he hold that guy down Rinella thought the bog routine off was holding him down with his leg. He was pinning him with his leg full champion pipe. Yeah. I'm like, no, he wasn't actually pinning him with his leg. He's like, why was I got pin in that guy and was like, but that a person who doesn't ever do Marshall, excuse me, martial arts, they look at some shit and they don't know what's happening. They're like, like, how do he hit him with a Shin?

Speaker 3:          01:41:38       What the heck? That guy, he flipped around and he hit the guy with his shin. Like they couldn't even recreate it. If you showed someone and they didn't have any knowledge of martial arts at all and you showed them Edson Barboza versus Terry Adam where Edson Barboza hits him with this wheel kick from hell. Like one of the worst wheel case I've ever seen anybody to absorb in any combat sport ever. I mean, the guy just got it. Terry. Adam looked like he got shot. He got shot with a sniper, just boom, stiffens up and down like his head exploded. If you showed that to somebody, they'd be like, what did he do?

Speaker 2:          01:42:09       What's he flipped around through the air. The guy flew through the air and he hit him with his foot, you know, like how did he hit him on his foot? I got crazy like just jumping through the year. Like you wouldn't even know how that happened actually when I think it was hoists. Gracie right here you're in is right here.

Speaker 3:          01:42:26       Oh Shit. Are you fucking kidding me? Like a sniper, right? That doesn't, you don't ever land a more perfect, we'll kick boom, look at that. I mean that shit is full flawless technique and he hit him in the perfect spot. Any hit him is Edom is moving forward like Adam steps to him and it just runs right into that heal.

Speaker 2:          01:42:49       I saw that thing happen. I think it was hoists Gracie fighting, maybe it was Dan Severn or somebody, but the big guy was on top of hoists. Hoisin Dan Severn each handled him and he triangled them and I was, I had a bunch of people over at the house. My family loved these things. We watched him from the start and people were like, what the fuck happened? What the fuck happened? Like they couldn't possibly imagine that the guy on top, the big guy on top gave up. Why? Why? How did just what? I don't get it. I don't get it. You mean you can be on top and lose? You know, it was like full ma'am. Nobody understood it at all. Yeah. It's like what his legs around the guy's neck? Yeah. Make them suck is kind of, can you make him stuck? Is that any theory was valid at that point? Nobody knew.

Speaker 3:          01:43:29       I remember watching UFC two was the first one that ever watched. I watched it on video tape was a VHS tape and a, I just come to Hollywood and it was in like 94 and I was out here doing TV and I saw 'em at the video store. They had like UFC two was it, I don't even know. UFC One was available. There was some sort of licensing issue. You can only rent UFC two at the, and so,

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       uh, I got ahold of it and I watched it and I had been a martial artist since I was a young boy. So watching this, all of a sudden I was like, oh my God, everything I know is useless. I think I really had this feeling like if that guy got ahold of me, I'm fucking getting get strangled just like this big giant guy. But he's fucking up these big giant guy. He arm barred chemo, you know, he's, he's fucking up these guys that are like way bigger than me that I wouldn't want to fight and like, Whoa, how's he doing that? I think I was, my size is 170 pounds at the time. It was like, the fuck is he beating these guys? I immediately was like, I got to learn Jujitsu. And then as soon as I went to Jujitsu, I got mauled over and over and over again.

Speaker 4:          01:44:35       Like he just, it completely got my ass kicked where I thought like, well, I've been a martial artist for, you know, fucking long time. When I get in there I'm going to learn easier than most people. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're not going to go in there with any, I had a little bit of wrestling from high schools that helped a little bit. I kind of knew about manipulating bodies and I knew about leverage, but I didn't know any of the techniques. I didn't know what was going on, especially with the gay dudes are just grabbing my collar and I'm like, what's going on here? And I was like twisting it around my neck and fucking holding onto it to put my arm in a position when they get snap it in half and you're like, Oh God, I'm so vulnerable.

Speaker 4:          01:45:15       Like it was just leaving there feeling like, fuck, I'm so vulnerable. I didn't know it was this vulnerable. I thought it was way tougher than this. Yeah, changes, changes the world thing. These techniques, you don't even know what a guy is doing to you. And all of a sudden you and when it's happening to you, it's even more confusing because you can't see what's going on. Sometimes when you're getting strangled, well, when you get into arm barred, like this is, um, there's a massive legs and arms and tangle and you're trying to grapple and all of a sudden his legs over across your face, you don't even seeing what's happening and you're getting arm bar, you're not sure, especially in the beginning, you don't recognize the dangerous positions. You don't know when to defend or even how to defend. So when you get stuck in these spots, it's literally a mystery where your arm is screaming in pain.

Speaker 4:          01:45:57       Like, why am I fucking shut? The fuck happened there? My shoulder, why is my hand behind my back? I remember I grappled Mario Charles, who was like a Jujitsu silver medalist and somewhere in, in Brazil, I was in Florida, Annapolis. And I go to just, I was there. So I was like, all right, well fuck all grapple with somebody really good. So I go there and I'd never really wrestled with, grappled with somebody who had a good butterfly guard, like a really good one. And I was just floating along, getting arm barred and choked constantly. I felt like I never fucking got to the ground, you know, he's just pushing and pulling and lifting and flip. I was like, this is a fucking new level. Yeah, this is a whole new game, especially with the gay, because with the g they can hold onto collars. You only hold on, hold on to the end of your, uh, your sleeves and you know those two things.

Speaker 4:          01:46:45       One Hand in the collar, one hand the sleeve man, your hands both feet under your hips, feet on your hips. So you're flying up in the air. So you got one arm completely locked out. You're trying to defend with this on Jesus Christ. This arms we were fucking neck is turned sideways. Guys got a forum across your neck holding on tight to your collar. It's like you've had a video of what happened to me. That was it. Oh good. I've been there. John Shock does that to me still. And I'm a black robe. The judge Jack, I'm up in the air man. When you, you know you feel someone is really good at getting those butterfly guards in and flipping you here and there. It's a skill that you develop, the ability to lift someone up and manipulate them and a lot of people don't understand how high level the top level Jujitsu guys have achieved because you only see Jujitsu and MMA and Jujitsu and MMA is a lot.

Speaker 4:          01:47:32       It's actually like less advanced than kickboxing and MMA because there's some, there's some really like high level kickboxing that you see occasionally in MMA with elite fighters and it's also kickboxing and MMA is a tad more dangerous than kickboxing and kickboxing because the gloves are smaller. You can't protect the same way like kickboxing. They can, they can go in this shell, they have this like [inaudible]. He's really good at that. Even the holds up real high with the shell and they move forward and they throw kicks and punches to come back to that Shell, but that Shell and MMA punches still getting slipped through and one will do you in. It's not like a boxing punch with that big glove is a different sort of a thunderous effect that are really hard puncher with an MMA glove house on. But when there's no striking, then you get to see what real high level Jujitsu is all about.

Speaker 4:          01:48:23       And you get to see a guy like a shock or ra or a Hodrick Gracie or crone, Gracie or Marcello Garcia, these super, super high level guys going at it. And you get to see Jujitsu that is on a level that you almost never see when there's, you know, punches involved and kicks involved. So to someone who doesn't know like what really high level Jujitsu looks like, when you, you know, you said you think you kind of have an idea of what the baseline is. Well you know, I've seen Anderson Silva tap out channels, sign it on the ground, so I'm pretty sure I know what you're just, it looks like you really don't because the Anderson Silva gets tapped out if he goes to Jiu Jitsu tournaments, there's a video of him getting tapped out why he was a champion. You got arm barred. And that's just, that's the way the world man.

Speaker 4:          01:49:03       He's is another level, the level, the super, super high level. Jujitsu is a, it's fucking wild to watch cause these guys are masters, then they're ninjas and they're hitting these high speed moves and countering these moves and he can watch guys like really like technical guys and you're watching these wild roles and it's like Jesus Christ. It's, you know, it's, it's such a beautiful thing that all of these arts kinda got a testing ground and I wish it could be applied to other things because just in the way that the UFC made people take the very best from everything, the very best from karate, the very best from taekwondo, the very best from Jujitsu, wrestling, all these different things. Judo, everybody contributed a little piece to the puzzle. Some pieces way bigger. Obviously

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       Jujitsu's pieces of the pie was a big fucking meaty piece of the pot, you know? But everything had a little point, you know, except for maybe some Weird Kung foods. It probably contributed maybe only the tiniest little sliver of something. I Dunno. But, and then in life people are still, because there isn't that proving ground with like philosophies and meditation techniques and Yoga Philosophy, yoga schools, they get so rigid in defending their way, their dogma of what they think. You know, this is the only way, just like martial artists used to be my Dojo is the only way it's the deadly arts, blah, blah, blah. You know, it's, it's a shame that there isn't some way to really have that kind of intercourse where you test every different skill and just use what works. But you know, I think we can do that ourselves anyways. And I think that's the right philosophy.

Speaker 2:          01:50:33       Take a little bit from all of these great religious philosophies, these schools of thought, Buddhism, Zen, Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism, Islam, everybody has a little verse. Some might be fatter piece of the pie for you than others, but everything has some way to contribute to this and all these other techniques. You know, if you'd like transcendental meditation, okay, maybe that's a big piece, but maybe try some of the other meditation cycles are, if you like Bikram Yoga, okay, that can be a piece. But try these other things too. The same thing needs to be applied across the fucking board, but because there's no way for these people to battle and for people to ostensibly see it, improve it, it doesn't happen. And you get stuck back in 1970s martial arts where everybody's defending their stupid Dojo when really the best way is a little bit of everything. Zero lot of them

Speaker 4:          01:51:21       like a, that sort of a ideology when it comes to yoga. Bikram Yoga. It's like that crazy though. Yeah, he's great. He wears gold chain but he's accused of like a bunch of sexual assaults. No idea. I have no personal knowledge of posters from Amy cause I know that big room yoga guy I talked to, the guys did talk to some guys in front of me. But yeah, those guys

Speaker 2:          01:51:45       so rigid about that being the only way and it's 18 postures and it's at this fucking degree temperature and everything else is bullshit.

Speaker 4:          01:51:53       You're like, uh, okay if you say so. But yeah, I kind of like doing some other shit too. Sexual harassment scandal, rocks, Yoga community after beak room. The dude's name is bea crumb chewed Hori. I don't know if I'm saying that right. It's slapped with a lawsuit and there's a, apparently the dude drives Bentleys and shit. Super baller. He's a super baller. He seems like he's a handsome guy. He's probably gotten mad yoga pussy because imagine the yoga pussy that guy gets was little speedos on doing stretches with chicks and it's all about releasing and pressure and positions and just sliding it into your pussy. Oh. Oh. Look at them there with two hot chicks. He probably fucked both of them. He probably did splits and fuck them. It was he standing on a chicken. That one. Yeah. That's insane. Wow. Let Joey Diaz try that.

Speaker 4:          01:52:49       I'm not impressed. I'm impressed with his age though. The Guy 67 years old, he's still getting sexual harassment. That means he's still active. Congratulations Yoga. It's yoga. It's like a fucking asshole. This is the sexy Jurassic Energy Kundalini. It's clearly, he must be a real shit head. He started beaker him in the early seventies and now it's turned into this gigantic fucking huge movement. It's really good though. That's the problem with Bikram Yoga. I mean, as much of a piece of shit is this guy may or may not be. I never met him, obviously. I mean, who knows these people who are saying he sexually harass them. They can be fucking nuts. I don't know. But you know the guy, it's, it's been around. Yeah, it's good. I mean, but it's a benefit to it. There's some other really good hot yoga too. Yeah, it's a lot. We'll just show somebody many positions in Yoga.

Speaker 4:          01:53:40       And the thing about beacons is they have this very specific routine to the take you through this very specific. It's a fucking great, don't get me wrong. I love it. I mean it's, it's an amazing, amazing workout and it's amazing for your, your thought process and your mind. He likes standing on bitches. Look at them and that's fucking weird. And the Christ pose. Yeah. No, I think that's warrior one or something. No, fucking Christ. Suppose I know warrior one warrior. I've definitely not snail boy. Well you're saying stand on a bitch. Yeah. Hit the Christ pose and fucker guy looks good for 67 though. Man Must be something to that Yoga Shit. I mean, I don't know how old these constantly staring. I checks. Where's the grossest speedos? Yeah, he's like 200 pounds from looking like a sumo wrestler. No, I think he's a tiny guy.

Speaker 4:          01:54:31       I think this is an illusion because he's standing on a small woman. I think he's already big at all. You know, he's, he's really skinny and super flexible. I wonder if, why doesn't he ever stand on any dude's rude? They'll kick his ass. I always eat pounds cause he doesn't want to fuck to dudes too. He stands on you puts a stinky feet all over your neck. You're more likely to let them slip his dick inside you. Is that the way it goes? That's what I think in my fantasy world that I just created with him banging all these chicks for real. I don't know what the real story is. He says he's disappointed in the false charges made in this lawsuit but will not comment at this time. I'm disappointed. That's my bad Indian accent. It sounded very, very kind of old visual arts movie.

Speaker 4:          01:55:12       Very vague, very vague accent. But this, yeah, I beat from Missoula is a very, uh, in, you know, very involved. There's a lot going on with that whole beat grim movement. You know, people loved, they loved to follow those poses. Yeah. And you know, and that's, and that's fine and that can be a big fucking piece of your yoga puzzle. You liked that. Cool. There's nothing wrong with that, but don't shit on other people who are finding their own way to do it and maybe learn something from them too. And you know, try that every once in a while. Maybe every fucking fourth session you try something new. You ever do yoga on pot? I have. It's really good. That's actually one of the best physical activities to do on pod in my opinion, is the best to me that in Jujitsu, but it's, it's right up there with Jujitsu because a, you feel everything and this weird super sensitive way, especially eating it when you eat it and go through all those yoga movements.

Speaker 4:          01:56:04       Mckenna believed that, that turns me cannot believe that. That's really what yoga was all about. He said it was all about how to eat out, eat cannabis. Like he, he believed that he believed that the or original origins of yoga. We're like a cannabis optimization. Uh, exercise makes sense. I mean, I naturally, when I smoke or eat one a stretch generally, even if I'm not even thinking about it. Good. It feels good. And you guys aware of what body, what's your areas that need work? You, you want to stretch. And if my teeth are dirty, I want to brush my teeth. Yeah. Those are the things. Yeah. I feel like when I got my feet stink, I want to get in the shower. Right. Don't want to be stinky feet when you're hi. Yeah. Hey, pull up that video of the drugs are getting yelled at because I want to, I want to hear that. You want to hear what was sure. Because this is not something that would have even happened a few years ago and this is a, this is some new shit and I'm going to pee because I got, I've been drinking

Speaker 8:          01:56:58       with all due respect to the fellows on the other side, uh, that schizophrenia, which my father was a psychiatrist and taught me something about, could be described as a party that talks about saving money all the time and have been concerned with deficits and being totally driven by that, but not being concerned and saving money when people are in jail for marijuana and mandatory minimums that judges have said were awful and for nonviolent first time offenders who were serving lifetime sentences and Jay are costing US $30,000 a year and to the population of jails has gone up 800% in the last 30 years that schizophrenia, you're concerned about cost and cutting costs, but not when it's jailing a population. Mr about a Cellie, your hands are tied on, on schedule one, but it is ludicrous, absurd, crazy,

Speaker 5:          01:57:51       okay

Speaker 8:          01:57:52       to have marijuana in the same level as heroin.

Speaker 5:          01:57:57       Ask

Speaker 8:          01:58:00       the Light Phillip Seymour Hoffman if you could.

Speaker 5:          01:58:03       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:58:03       Nobody dies from marijuana.

Speaker 8:          01:58:07       People die from heroin. And every second that we spend in this country trying to enforce marijuana laws is a second that we're not enforcing heroin laws and heroin and math are the two drugs that are ravaging our country. And every death, including Mister Hoffman's, is partly the responsibility of the federal government to drug power. These for not putting total emphasis on the drugs that kill, that caused people to be addicted and have to steal to support their habit and heroin and meth is where all of your priority should be. Heroin is getting into the arms of young people, and when we put marijuana on the same level as heroin and LSD and meth and crack and cocaine, we are telling young people not to listen to the adults about the ravages and the problems and they don't listen because they know you're wrong. It's all due respect. You should be listening to the scientist. I understand the parents who are grieved because they're dot child died of an overdose. They didn't overdose on marijuana and you're listening to them rather than the scientist. Mr Bata Chelly it may go back to a few good men, the movie Jack Nicholson, you can't handle the truth. The truth is the drug war failed. Your direction on marijuana is a failure.

Speaker 5:          01:59:37       Get

Speaker 8:          01:59:38       to dealing and saving kids from heroin overdoses. Now you talked about alcohol and I may, you may have gotten to this cirrhosis of the liver. Pretty serious thing. Violence against spouses and women. People don't smoke marijuana and beat up their wives and girlfriends.

Speaker 5:          01:59:57       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:59:58       They get drunk. Sometimes they beat up their wives and girlfriends. Maybe the reason there's so many more people smoking marijuana now is cause they're not listening and maybe they're doing the other drugs too, but also shows that the drug war has been a failure. It's been a serious failure.

Speaker 5:          02:00:15       Okay,

Speaker 4:          02:00:15       boom. That was an ass kicking. No, he that this guy from Tennessee, representative of Tennessee. Yup. And you would think like one of the most conservative states in the country and he's a little belt and yeah, he's old as fuck too. Yeah. That's fucking positive sign. I like that. I like it. Well, it's, it's, it's unavoidable at this point in time. It's, it's gotten to this point where there's so much information, there's so much, so many studies have been done. So much knowledge that there occasionally they'll throw out a study, uh, you know, some link to schizophrenia. If somebody's horse shit, if there was a link to schizophrenia and marijuana, everybody would be schizophrenia because everyone's smoking weed. I'm not, I'm, I don't mean anything everyone, but I mean, God damn a lot of people. Yeah. You know, the thing that's so fucking incredibly frustrating and infuriating is as part of the criteria for scheduled one, the drug has to have no medicinal benefit and oh, medicinal benefit and countless fucking medicinal benefits are being shown by a lot of these drugs. I mean, the success rate of them testing things and getting positive results. It's only been recent. They've been able to get access to things like siliciden and even the marijuana studies that they've been able, there's still hardly are ever able to even work with marijuana. It's one of the toughest ones to work with, talking to the people at maps. But every, you know, they're testing these things and it's coming back amazingly positive. You something like

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       that. Sanjay Gupta completely reversing as policy because he watched some kid who was on 14 fucking pharmaceuticals that were going to kill her and then she smokes weed cause she had epilepsy, smokes weed that has high CBD and is doing better than she ever has in her life. And he's like, okay, I'm fucking, I was a Dickhead, I was a doctor. But now I know what fucking happened. Good for him because he was saying a lot of really dumb shit he fucking switched is you look at the facts and you can't help but change your opinion that there is medicinal benefit period. You cannot leave it in that criteria. It's almost like the perfect question. It's almost like how fucked up is this culture?

Speaker 3:          02:02:21       We're going to give this culture, this amazing plant that grows easily, has no issues with toxicity, doesn't kill anybody. Also you can eat it. It provides you with all the essential amino acids. It's very high in protein and you can get high on it and when you get high on it makes you introspective and makes you more sensitive. It makes food actually taste more delicious. It makes sex feel better, makes your body feel more sensitive and it can help you with Glaucoma and it makes the best paper and it makes them, you just run this laundry list of shit you like. There's no way that could be illegal. It's the most illegal thing. It's the most illegal thing in our crazy country. It's like the perfect question to find out how insane our society do. We have no meter. One thing that we can say is the most beneficial plant on earth. It's the marijuana plant. That's the one and that's, that's schedule one drug elite. The most illegal amongst the most illegal things you can buy.

Speaker 2:          02:03:25       It's like at the circus where you hit that thing with a mallet and it goes all the way to the top. That's goes all the way to the top of the crazy meter. Let's

Speaker 3:          02:03:32       talk about how nuts it is that that same drug is also now legal in two states like the these two. These states have gotten so fed up Washington and Seattle, both two of the most awesome spots in the country. They've gotten or Washington and Colorado, they've gotten to this point where they're like, you know what? Fuck you. It's legal. Okay. We say it's legal in our state. It's legal now. Yet you could sell it in Colorado. They're going gangster and Seattle. They're like washing Colorado going, what's gonna happen there? But in Colorado they just fucking salad in it, selling it like crazy. And then the government's like, yeah, well you can't put the money in the bank then. And then eventually they re have revisited that and said, okay, we're going to let people use the banks because it's so much fucking money. There's so much money. Like what? You're going to keep that money out of the bank so the bank fucking failing. Don't the banks needed money? What are you guys doing? Like you got to this emerging industry and you better look at it as an industry now because now it's proven itself. They made $1 million in the first fucking hour when they were selling marijuana in Colorado. They were just fucking going off and it's only like 12 stores and one day they made 1 million bucks. Yeah. This is, this is a really encouraging, I mean, I think

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       once you start to see water pouring through the damn like this, it's going to, it's going to break the dam. The more they resisted and don't go along with it. It's just going to fucking, it's gonna crack it. I mean it's just information excited. It's too much information. Yeah. There's too much absolute irrefutable information. And the, the, the cool thing about these states is, you know, if you have real good states' rights, the ability for states to regulate a lot of these things, it's going to be a great way to ensure that some of these draconian, crazy bullshit laws don't get passed because some states are going to wake up, you know, in this big nationwide consciousness, it's easier to kind of get enough dummies circled together from everywhere to block something. But you know, in one state, you know, you have a lot of more flexibility to actually spread information, create a new kind of vibe and create new rules. Like they decided they're not supposed to be able to do that. They're not supposed to be able to say weed is legal, but they just said we're just fucking doing it. You know, I don't care if the federal laws say you can't, we're going to do it and maybe you could come in with the feds and cause trouble, but you know we're going to take that risk. And I think putting a lot more rights like that back to the states is, is the way to go.

Speaker 4:          02:05:46       Oh, whatsapp. Absolutely. I mean that's the whole reason why the whole state situation was set up in the first place. In states rights are supposed to supersede the federal rights or laws rather. We're supposed to supersede the federal laws. And I think we're also saying this overwhelming wave of information starting to shift the way they interact with us and the way they're forced to deal with certain situations when it comes to world events like Syria for example, when Obama went on TV and was talking about military action for Syria, the whole world went, Ooh, Ooh, you want, you have to do what? Why? Because somebody poisoned people. Do you know what you've done? Do you know a million people are dead and I racked and many people you'd kill from drones. It had nothing to do with the person you were trying to kill. Shut the fuck up.

Speaker 4:          02:06:36       No, you don't have to go to Syria now. It's not important. We invade Syria and then they stopped talking to him about it. When was the last time you heard Syria and the news and that was the last time you said Siri on CNN. When was the last time you saw Syria on Fox News where they were saying if the invasions eminent the imminent invasion of Syria? No, no, no, no. It's all gone. People don't want that. And that's the thing, that's another thing that people get frustrated with how spineless the politicians are. But in another way it's kind of encouraging and they really have no fucking backpack. If we really mount up and say, no, that's bullshit, don't do that. That's for fucking were over. And we do that in mass like people did for Syria. They'll just say, okay cool. Cause they're going to survive too. And to survive they have to get elected. You know? And I know all vote rigging, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. All right. Maybe they push things a little bit, but if it's fucking in mass, you know they're going to go along with the tide. We just got to create the tide

Speaker 2:          02:07:27       and s and make enough motion ourselves unified that they have to listen. And I think we've done that with weed. It's going to continue. Keep going that way. And we could do that with a lot of other shit too. Yeah. This is as long as that. There's truth

Speaker 3:          02:07:40       and what we're saying. Yeah. In the marijuana truth is something that seems so impossible and improbable cause there's so much from the moment that it was made illegal from the whole conspiracy to make it illegal by a guy who was at paper manufacturer and own newspapers, William Randolph Hearst. If you read the story of how marijuana was made illegal, I won't bore you with the details because I've told it on this podcast too many times, but it's a guy who owned newspapers. He made a bunch of fucking stories up and that's how we became illegal. And when they made weed illegal, they didn't even know they were making hemp illegal. Now they recently passed this farm bill. Did you see this where they're going to allow states that make hemp growing legal to grow it at universities. So the universities are going to be allowed to grow hemp. So in a, in a way it's sort of making hemp start to become legal and I don't know if that's for commercial application. I don't, I don't know like what they're going to be able to do with the ham, but that's even dumber than the weed law. If you thought the weed law was bad, this hemp thing is even fucking crazier because it is legal. They just can't grow it, which is so fucking stupid.

Speaker 2:          02:08:55       I hear you. I'm importing a bunch of hemp over fucking fucking the Canadian border. Every, every month we're getting to the hemp seeds from Canada because we can't grow it. Do we have shitty soil? No, we don't have shitty soil. I show it was great. It could grow. We'd like fucking anybody else in the world, but nope, we can't do it.

Speaker 3:          02:09:12       So many farmers would profit. So many farmers would benefit. Just like you seeing this economic boom in Colorado because of these people being able to sell marijuana. Look at that pot shops in Denver, open door to foreign in 78 $578 million in sales a year, $578 million. And that's just the beginning. That's just the tip of the iceberg.

Speaker 2:          02:09:33       Those states are going to be in from the revenue from that. They're going to be fucking have cool public areas and parks and art. The states are going to get cooler and cooler and cooler till finally everybody's like, fuck man, we got to move to one of these cool states. They got the best parks, they've got the best fucking public works, everything's working smooth cause they got money and everybody's happy. And that's what's generally going to happen in the neighboring states. Going to be like, God Damn Colorado's fucking got it going on. You know, and fucking Idaho. I think I'd know borders Colorado, right? Idaho's gonna be like, well fuck this. You know, we're not going to like Colorado would be the ones to win, so it's going to create this ripple effect where, you know, I think it's going to, it's going to spread. I fucking love Colorado.

Speaker 3:          02:10:14       I just love it. I loved that they were the first, you know, the m and Washington state, but just Colorado is just, it's such a fucking gangster, cowboy state, you know? It's like, it's such a weird combination of like western pioneer people who move there and really cool people who stayed, you know? It's like

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       everybody else was going to California and the people that stopped in Colorado went, we move. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Can we just stay here? Like why don't we just, why are you guys going to keep going west man, do you see how beautiful it is here? Do you really think over there is better? I mean, what, what? Come on man. What's listen, go over there. Make sure you send me a letter. Tell me how groovy it is. I'll be right here. Shirt. When you find a place that's unbelievably physically beautiful like Colorado, I always think that for some reason that is going to accumulate a lot of intelligent and cool people because there's a benefit in having beauty around you. Does the reason why people spend so much money on art? Why do people dress so nice? Why do people have nice cars is do they have nice cars to drive or do they have nice cars to look at?

Speaker 4:          02:11:17       What's not just to dry? Because if it was just to drive, every car would look like a rock on the outside and inside of it would just be this, you know, really opulent luxurious thing that made you feel good as a, as a passenger. No, you don't. Most people don't even worry about what the inside looks like. You look on the inside of that car, they got fucking Jack in the box wrappers on the ground, fucking empty soda cans and Starbucks is flopping around their cup holder and I'm worried at all but the inside. But the outside is polished and shiny. Why is it? Because when you look at things that are beautiful, they give you a feeling that give you a good feeling. That's why, you know when you're taking your woman out and you know you go, you ready and she's like yeah and she steps out and you look at it and like Whoa, he looked great.

Speaker 4:          02:11:57       Like Ooh, this feeling, this law, this feeling of of observing beauty. You know, hopefully you do that. I mean you might be, might be unfortunate in that regard but if you are fortunate in that regard, if you live in a neighborhood where this beautiful trees and you see the sunset and you see it, you know poking through these trees and you look over at the lake and it's fucking beautiful and you see a fish jump and you're like wow, like that. It's hitting you. It's energy. There's a lot of, and when you live with that is you probably like a little on the ball or at the very least your inspired by all this stuff being around you inspired by all this beauty of the info. It definitely makes a difference. You know, you look at, I think landscape really plays a bigger part than people give credit.

Speaker 4:          02:12:40       I mean you look at some of the, the hardest harshest places and they're dry as fuck generally. You know, like as far as from the, from a kind of philosophical and religious and kind of an area that's really difficult. You know, some of the, some of the worst kind of ID said it's not always the case, but you see a lot in like really challenging environments that are really fucked up. You get people who are really kind of obstinate and a lot of their ways that thinking where in the really kind of beautiful regions like Nepal versus China, you know, when you're around that kind of all inspiring, it's not that often that you see really crazy, you know, kind of philosophies that come up. I Dunno if it's the people move to that or whether the environment actually itself kind of has some impact on, on the psychology of the people who live around it.

Speaker 4:          02:13:25       And there's also, of course people that go to areas where there unbelievable, there's unbelievable beauty and exploit them. Europeans, you know, how many people have gone to the jungle and exploited the Amazon, the indigenous people, how many people have found resources in these strange, beautiful places and just fucked over tribe members? You know, Mckenna was talking about this, um, slaughter in the Amazon where a, I forget which country, where they were killing people for rubber when they found out about rubber. It was like in the early, uh, early 20th century and they were going in there and I'm giving these people like you had to have, he had to bring back this amount of rubber every day, and if you didn't, they would cut that amount of weight that's missing off in human flesh. So they slaughtered these people. I mean, they, they killed thousands and thousands of these people.

Speaker 4:          02:14:13       At one point in time, you know, they had over a hundred thousand people in this, in this area, and then they were down to just a couple thousand by the time, um, whoever the fuck rescued them. However, this was, uh, stopped. I don't recall the entire story, but this, the concept of giving them a quota and then removing that same amount and flesh, if they didn't reach that quota, cutting people's arms off kind of be, and doing it in front of everybody to make sure that these people were absolutely terrified to go out and people are capable of horrible, horrible things. But my point is that when they're not, when society stable, when you're not dealing with that sort of evil invaders, Mongol invasion type situation, when you're in a place that's beautiful. A lot of times the people there are pretty cool. Yeah. I, I tend to find the same thing and it's interesting how, you know, some places really do trigger that over others, you know, there's no each communities.

Speaker 4:          02:15:09       Yeah. Then there's, you just know when you're in a special place, you know, I don't know what I, the whole beauty concept is interesting, you know, like why is that one place like why is looking out over the mountains in Colorado more beautiful than, you know, the Cedar Trees in Texas. I live in Texas and I'm never really inspired by the beauty of the Texas fucking hill country. It's nice. I like it. I love Texas. I love living there, but it's not the same as when I go to like a beautiful beach or I go to a beautiful mountain or I go even if there's even beautiful like desert landscapes that I've love. But it's funny how there's something that just goes and hits the right buttons in the brain says this is beautiful. You know, they've studied that with people at people at some form of symmetry and health and, but with nature it's even kind of more curious.

Speaker 4:          02:15:54       It's just more maybe more like there's a life force or an order to it. I think we like order, you know, maybe we're part of that creating force and when we do that we like to look at things that look like they're ordered and organized by some kind of presence. I don't know. We were also trying to figure out the other day because one of my sponsors is 1-800-FLOWERS. We're trying to figure out why flowers are so fucking beautiful. I mean, what is it about flowers? What evolutionary advantage is there to being enthralled by these powerful colors to lips and roses.

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       And it's like, ah, but if you see a beautiful bouquet of flowers, man, there's a feeling that it gives you this feeling of like admiration of nature's artwork that's like, wow, beautiful thing. And I think for your feeling as a, a mountain or something that is Huxley, Huxley, he had an idea that these visions that you see in the psychedelic experiences are generally very colorful environment. He did a lot of cactus medicines like Mescalin and, and things like that. And so the colors get really intensely vibrant and visual and bright. And he was saying that we find beautiful, those things that mimic what we see in, in that form of experience. You know, so like in a DMT trip, you know, the colors are out of this world are Iowasca trip. The colors are so vibrant and beautiful and amazing and they come in a lot of these, what the, they actually call it the chrysanthemum, which is named after a flower cause they come in these kaleidoscopic patterns of things that actually do look like a flower.

Speaker 2:          02:17:24       So I think there may be something to that theory, maybe in whatever realm beyond that you're accessing or whatever nether regions of your mind. If you don't want to go to realm beyond, there's some ideal of what you see there and it, and it's looking at a flower, like a beautiful Blue Chrysanthemum reminds you of that. Even if it's subliminally and you don't have had a psychedelic experience that triggers whatever you know of some way back home or some other realm or some part of your brain that you don't really access often. Maybe that's what it is. Maybe flowers remind us of psychedelics. Yeah, that's kind of interesting. That's an interesting thought because um, that's what they call that. That gateway when you first breakthrough to DMT and you see that crazy pattern, they call it the flower of life. And that that flower of life is, is a very common geometric pattern that exists in a lot of religious artwork, mosques and things are going to, and God damn, it's beautiful.

Speaker 2:          02:18:17       And when you see that you just can't help but just fucking smile and look like, Holy Shit. That's pretty, yeah, and when you're having a psych, there's a flood. It's the, the very rough crude version of that symbol. But yeah, you can look up, look up DMT chrysanthemum or something like that. That's exactly what you see though. That's the weirdest thing. It's like when you, when you're confronted with these archetypes that exist in, you know, somewhat in so many different pieces of artwork and you see it like right in front of your face, just like, whoa. Like that's so like so classic. It's a classic image. Like wow. It's just, it is, it is exactly what you've seen that, you know, and he said that about gemstones too, you know? And that's why the fascination with these gemstones, why are gemstone so valuable? Because that's really back in the ancient days, okay, water kind of reflects, but there wasn't all this glass. And Shit that we created now, but they would be able to see, there'd be able to see something in that gemstone, you know, all the facets and the colors and the light and they, and it was so beautiful to them because that was something that they could only see in there, you know, these visions or that, that Nether region of the mind. So flowers,

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       gems, all these things that we prize or actually hearkening back to those, you know, those visions that we have. Yeah. And for people to think that it's total complete horseshit, one of the reasons why they think that is your brain most certainly produces psychedelic drugs. And they, they think that your brain producing them in large quantities while you're dreaming. And so they're, they're doing some studies on that now. And the Cottonwood Research Foundation, which was where, I'm sorry, how about cough drop in my mouth? Doctor Rick Strassman who wrote the book Dmt, the spirit molecule. Um, he was supposed to be here on the podcast last month, but he's such a fucking hippie. It doesn't even have a cell phone. And a, we were exchanging emails, but it was a UFC weekend and I was gone. He hadn't heard from me for a couple of days because I just don't do my email for a couple of them just fucking busy.

Speaker 1:          02:20:14       Right. And so he thought some, for some reason, another I had my mind or something like that. It's crazy. They made other plans. I was like, dude, what's, get a phone? It'd be so easy to fix that conversation. You know, I call you, you called me. But um, he's in the middle of some, uh, some new tests and he's got a new book coming out, so we'll have monsoon for sure. He's a really cool guy. I really love Rick. Uh, but he, um, he did some work recently where they discovered that this is a, it's always been the big controversy. Does DMT m and a from the pineal gland, that what is literally your third eye that in know the center of the brain has this eye that this, this thing that in reptiles actually has a retina and cornea, you know, it's this weird fucking Oregon.

Speaker 1:          02:20:59       And they were the always hypothesis hypothesized that DMT had come from there. That's the seat of the soul and ancient religions and the bent knee injections. Yeah. Well then they found out that they actually can prove it now rats and live rats and a live rat, they have gone straight to the pineal gland and found DMT. So they know the DMTs coming out of the pineal gland of live rats. Pretty sure it's coming out of ours too. Yeah, most likely. And if that is the case and your brain does produce this stuff for sure, it's in Dodgers to the human body for sure. It's produced by the liver and the lungs and they're pretty sure for sure it's produced by the pineal gland and pretty sure that while you're sleeping, that shit's coming out. So one of the interesting facets of about, um, a lot of psychedelic trips, especially DMT, is that after it's over, it's very difficult to hang on to the memories. Like they drift away and they fade away so quickly. It's like they're so intense. And then when they're over there, this lost feeling. And I've been really thinking lately because of my experiences with a Alpha brain in an isolation tanks that there might be something to that with psychedelic trips for, you know, having a psychedelic trip while you are really loaded up with nootropics. Like we'd have to figure out what is the optimum blend to give you the most clarity in recalling experience.

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       Yeah. Because just like a dream, DMT disappears. And so the idea is that when you're asleep, you know, we just accept the fact that we shut off for eight hours a night. If you're lucky eight hours and disappear and then wake up and then, oh, I've got a crazy dream. I was on a skateboard and there was a missile coming my way or whatever the fuck your dream is that that's about as crazy as it ever got. But that might not be the case. You might be in full blown psychadelic dream state at several times during the night. Well you are just like a DMT trip, just like the most intense mushroom trip with your eyes closed in a dark room. Like all those things you, you might be experiencing that on a regular basis. And one of my reasons for being inclined to think that is that every time I've done DMT I go, and not even the the Times now, but the times when I first did it, I go, Oh, I've been here. I know this place. Like the very first time I did it, I remember that feeling like, Oh, I've been here before, I know this place. Like why do I know this place? And then I'm back to reality.

Speaker 2:          02:23:36       It is a funny, that sense of familiarity is funny, especially in that, you know, cause after a while, I guess you could say it's because you've associated positively from going there during the trip before, but it really feels like, it feels like another type of home, you know, where you're just in a place that's really beautiful. It's communicating in a new way, you know, they can't, sometimes words come through through beings and things like that, but really it's just some kind of information is splashing against this force field that we have in the mind and creating these beautiful colors and passing along information in some code that we can't quite decipher, but we know it, you know, and we know something about that message and it's, it's a fucking beautiful place.

Speaker 3:          02:24:18       It also seems to know that you're not supposed to be there while your conscious and so it's trying to give you some information while you're there. It's, it seems like, like I've always felt like when I've done DMT that while it's happening, they're like, well can you do in here? Oh look at you. You're here. What are you here? You're here now. So as almost like consciousness, like being conscious, being a person who is awake and turning on your television and hitting your keyboard is a mode that you're not supposed to operate that dimension with. So you're sort of tricking the universe. When you introduced that dimension to a conscious mode, it's like the conscious mode is like, what the fuck is this all you don't remember? You don't know. You all know you don't know. And then you're like, why do I know this place? Like, Oh, you don't know. You don't know why you know it. We love you. That's one of the things I'll never forget. I had one really intense experience and they're going, we love you. 600 million, 500,000 times. Look at this. And it kept saying, look this. And every time it would say, look at this, it would show me something like insanely

Speaker 1:          02:25:23       crazy, beautiful, impossibly beautiful. And then the next time it would be like a million times more beautiful than that. Like you thought that was as beautiful as it yet, look at this. They would show me something else. Crazy was, I love you 600 million, 500,000 times. Look at this,

Speaker 2:          02:25:38       you know, all of the, I've been really amazed. People think when you encounter, you know, some kind of entities or beings, they're going to be real boring. Like, Whoa, hello, welcome to my realm. Every time that I've communicated with any kind of spirit form and one of these trips there can, they can be funny. They're interesting. They're vibrant, you know? It's like, it's not what you think your dad. Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's like they, they have a sense of humor. It's, it's really interesting how that is, you know, we were so ridiculous in our ideas of how the world should be, how rigid scholars and learned people are supposed to be. You know, we have this idea that you, if you, yeah, if you have knowledge and wisdom and experience and if you're somehow or another quote unquote enlightened, then you're going to be like bland and flat.

Speaker 2:          02:26:23       Yeah, no, totally. You know, it reminds me, so one of the, the third experience I did in, in New Mexico, I came back and my next up on the, on the path after the snuffing, the five Meo DMT was a mushroom and Syrian rue trip. And they call that Anna Wasco because just a candy flipping motherfucker down. I just did what did, what, what the, did what the, you know, the woman said, uh, and this was up on the menu. This is my next fucking wow journey. So they call it Ana Wasco because it's something of an Iowa Ska analog, even though it's not DMT based mushrooms and Syrian Rue create that. Well, mushrooms are five, four locks [inaudible] trip to tryptamine. Oh really? Yeah. That's what psilocybin is. Psilocybin is, is, yeah, it's Dmt plus something else. Very interesting. One of the more fascinating things about mushrooms itself and then Syrian rue is a powerful Maoi. So it's like come kind of combining the same two forces that are in, yeah. Let me, Alaska Bruce, I've said it before and I've said it wrong.

Speaker 1:          02:27:21       Let me find out. So how do you spell silicide? P, s I. L. O. C y. B. I. N. C. Y. B. I n. Um, either Silverson or psilocybin is the, uh, the, the actual, yeah, here it is. Die. Oh boy.

Speaker 5:          02:27:41       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:27:41       I can't pronounce that. Okay. What the point is, forget about all the science behind because obviously I shouldn't be distributed at, there's Psilocybin, it's Scilla sin. What's, which one is Tillison. So Allison has also, um, I don't know, maybe some other active compound. Yeah. Yeah. So awesome. Um,

Speaker 5:          02:28:04       yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:28:04       is another one that's like really close to a human neuro transmitters. These things are, they're just there. They're super close there. They're super close to things that the human brain already has in it. Yup.

Speaker 2:          02:28:18       So, so anyways, I do this and in Wasco trip and it was, you know, I never done Iowasca at that point. It was my third psychedelic experience and this one was completely different. And in this one I was very much like some of the Iowasca stories I told. I was riding on the back of a Cobra and this Cobra was in the jungle and I'm in the fucking desert. Mexico mountains here. There's no jungle anywhere. So the fact that I was in a jungle was incredibly odd to me anyways, but I'm riding on the head of this Cobra and the back of a jungle and I'm talking with my grandmother who was like somehow imbued in the spirit of this, of this Cobra. And she was still alive by the way, which is another interesting facet. But anyway, so she's imbued in the spirit of this Cobra and I'm dipping down in the earth and much like the Iowasca visions, I'm having bugs come inside me and explode.

Speaker 2:          02:29:10       And meanwhile I'm laid out on my back and, um, I'm shivering and I'm kind of lifting my chest up. And I must've looked kind of crazy to the Shama, but she must've been kind of used to it cause I sweating profusely and I needed blankets. I was cold and I'm shivering and I'm going through this and this really intense vision. But all the while, my grandfather, who's Aubrey, my grandfather, Aubrey's out on these rocks and you know, in a whole different environment and he's just laughing, like laughing so warmly and like kindly cause he's saying, oh, you're really going through it now. Oh she's going to take you down there into the dirt. And he how with laughter. And he was so happy and joyous about doing it. I've never met my grandfather robbery. He was so happy and joyous about it. That experience that I started laughing too because I thought it was hilarious.

Speaker 2:          02:29:59       Even though spiders or like going into my eyes and exploding and I'm riding on the snake and I have no control and I'm dipping down into the earth and I'm expelling this sweat. And you know, Aubrey's just laughing. So I'm laughing and it was this whole wild experience. But the thing that impressed me the most was just how vibrant and happy it wasn't. Like, you know, you see these mediums and it's all so somber and serious. Aubrey says to say, you know, good luck in your next Algebra test, or I don't know what the fuck it was, but he was just happy as shit, you know? And that was the kind of experience that you, that I tend to find when I encounter these entities, but either family or these other things, it's really, they're full of life. They're almost that version in its best self.

Speaker 2:          02:30:45       That's also what you're looking for though. You're looking for love and you're looking for them to be full of life. So if you really are creating the university inside your own mind, that's what you as a positive person seeking positive experiences would create that to create your, all of your relatives being super cool. Yeah, it's absolutely true. This is what a Rick Strassman by the way said silicide. This is how he explained siliciden that psilocybin the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, uh, after being ingested, the body removes phosphorous atoms from the silicide been converting it to Scilla sin. Sin Listen differs

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       from dimethyltryptamine Dmt by one oxygen, uh, that silicide Silverson eh, he likes to think of it as orally active DMT. That's Rick Strassman's take on it. So that's what, that's the, the definition very interested in it's silicon is the, uh, that's the, the active, that's what happens when you, when you take it that it's, uh, it's four h o d m t silicide or silicon or it's, it's spelled a bunch of different cause this, cause this really was pretty much, and I lost a trip that I went on. The differentiators are very, you know, it's very similar. It makes sense. I mean if you're taking him Mao inhibitor and mushrooms, I've heard people have horrendous trips taking pharmaceutical, Mao inhibitors and mushrooms. I imagine these mean cause they're intensely powerful Mao inhibitors. Like if you take a mild Mao inhibitor, like say harming, you know, and compare it and that's what's in Syria and yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:32:18       Harmfully yeah. And by the way, harming when they first, this was really crazy when they first found it, they wanted to call it telepathy, but they couldn't because they didn't realize that when they discovered it by use of these, uh, the IOWASCA showman, they didn't understand that it had already been discovered that the, the chemical component of it already had a name. So they couldn't call it telepathy. But that was what they were inclined to call it because these people were tripping their balls out and having these fucking telepathic experiences. Shared experiences. Yeah. The problem is you can't document them. You know, you're, you're freaking the fuck out. You know, you know, but you can't show anybody. He was like, man, your bullshit and try this and they take it. Okay, what are we getting maintenance? How about telepathy? What a bunch of scientists decided to name something telepathy. Holy Shit. You know what, what are you taking? And the reason why we don't know about this folks is not because people are dying. The reason why we don't know about this is because we've been denied by our daddies. Buy Our daddy overlords are government. And they've kept these intensely powerful and hugely beneficial to some folks. Hugely beneficial experiences. Kept them from us.

Speaker 2:          02:33:28       Yeah, absolutely. And you can only imagine how many cool ways and places in the knowledge that was out there. I mean I'm very fortunate I was able to go with someone who had been doing this, leading people on these journeys for 20 years, you know, and had experience, no new kind of the properties of what to do, knew what to mix new, the amounts to do it. And so I could just really trust. But it gets sketchy if you're trying to trying to figure this stuff out. That's why I always recommend people go with a guide or someone who knows what to do. And those are sometimes hard to find, you know? And that's why the only thing I recommend now is going to some places where I've been in Peru and to do Iowasca so I can trust the, the Shaman, the Pearson to meister leading the ceremony. I can trust the medicine cause it's, you know, there's a lot of iffy stuff and that's another byproduct of making it illegal. No, it's because you're forced to make some

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       challenging choices, both risking legality, which sucks. You know, you don't want to wind up in a fucking cage, you know, or your choice, you know, forced to deal with something that you don't know the exact properties of where you don't know kind of what you're getting into. So it's a lot hairier of a situation.

Speaker 1:          02:34:34       Yeah. And you, if you're a person who has a job that you like, you want to keep that job. You know, you don't want to be fired. Do you want to be outcasts? Do you want to make sure you make your mortgage? You want to keep feeding your family and then they're gonna Piss test you. Oh God. That's what's really crazy. It's like you could smoke pot on Friday night when you get home from work and if they piss test you on Monday, you're stone cold sober. You're showing up for work. Clearheaded Caba coffee newspaper in your arm and they're like, Bob, we'd like to see you pee into this cup. Please. Like, what are you talking about? What'd you do this weekend? We own you. We own your body weight on your body. Did you do something illegal this weekend, Bob? No, no, no. Not at all.

Speaker 1:          02:35:17       Oh, you didn't? Hmm. We don't have a medical marijuana. Not Federally. Federal. You don't federal, you don't federally, it's illegal. So pee in the cup. And not only that, we're going to impose our own laws. We don't want you smoking cigarettes because that's bad for your health. We don't smell. You know what I mean? Fucking healthcare programs keep you from smoking cigarettes. They can tell you to do that. They could tell you to not smoke marijuana. They can tell you, you can't do mushrooms that can tell you know cocaine in your system. You did the fucking, they own you. Not from nine to five, Monday through Friday. They own you on Saturday and Sunday too. They own you 24 seven if you want to work for ups.

Speaker 4:          02:35:51       So brutal. They Test Your pee. Yeah. Yeah. And then that whole idea, if they really were out there for your benefit and locking you up was for your benefit. They'd lock up all the fat people. They'd lock up all the cigarette smokers. They'd lock up. Everybody doing any bad duck dynasty would go right off the air. At first they locked up all the fat people. Do you know how bad their ratings would drop the fucking right through the floor. It'd be like a sinkhole opened up right under duck dynasty. Same fucking thing. Obviously obesity kills you eventually and it kills you faster, way faster than that. If it's doing it for your own good, you should lock up all the fucking fat people, but that's insane. So they don't do it, but it's just as insane with our locking people up for, yeah, we don't need a daddy.

Speaker 4:          02:36:30       Stupid. Yup. And you're not smart enough to be my daddy. Dumb. Fuck, that's, that's our real problem, man. We got a bunch of fucking unenlightened people that are set in the rules and we're making it so you can't have these enlightening experiences and be a guy that sets the rules. Because if you are, well then we discredit you because you're a guy. Like we found out that Obama was going these shamonic trips and doing mushrooms. We'd be like, what can I get that fucking guy out of there? Not Us, not us, but America, the right. You imagine how fucking Hannity, those shitheads fucking that Sean Hannity type dudes. Meanwhile, it should be the criteria for leading our goddamn country. You should, you shouldn't be able to be president unless you done mushrooms at least once. The Shit

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       you shouldn't be allowed to and you should, you should have a videotape or you doing mushrooms so we could prove it like this is the mushrooms. Like it should be like, I need to know you did a big dose more than four grams. Right? I want to see you get fucking blown out in the center of the universe and then crawl back home. You know, like really? That's what I want to say it. If you don't, if you'd never done that man, that we're, we're having some weird conversation here because everybody who has done that agrees separate red band was fucking can't trust that he's done. He doesn't think it does anything, but that's him. But everybody else that I know that has had like a blown out breakthrough psychedelic experience, they believe that it changes lives. They believe that it enhances your personality. It gives you a new perspective, gives you a new way to look at the world and is probably hugely beneficial to your growth as a human being.

Speaker 1:          02:38:07       But the people that don't, they're the ones who judge it, that people that haven't had that experience, they're the ones who come out against him, which is so crazy. It's like blind people getting pissed that you're looking at things. It's like, what are you doing? You're looking at shit. No, no, no, no, no. I don't trust what you're seeing. What's right fucking in front of you, man. The lake's right there says, Ooh. Says you it crazy person using your eyes. That's really what, it's almost like someone who hasn't had a psychedelic experience trying to tell you that it's bad for you or that you shouldn't do it. It's like, are you sure? Okay. Because I'm okay. Not only am I okay, but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be this guy if it wasn't for those experiences. And, um, you're a silly bitch and you're telling me, you're telling me what to do based on nonsense. I think I, I think I'm going with my instincts here. I think I'm going to, I'm going counterculture on Ya. I'm going counter on a

Speaker 2:          02:39:02       culture. There's so many forces that are pushing us away from being conscious and away from being awake. That whole little mini rant you did about what goes through your daily life from the phones. So this honk. So the work, all of this stuff, it's not like it was back in the old days, you know back in the old days maybe you could walk your bare feet on the ground and you were pretty connected and you didn't need to take these massive psychedelic trips, although they probably did and fucking loved it all throughout all cultures. But that's besides the point, it wasn't maybe as necessary but now in this crazy weird world, it's so much easier to get off track. You know and you look on TV and it's really frustrate. I get really physically antsy and frustrated when I go somewhere and they have like real housewives on TV cause it's like so visible. The unconsciousness that's going on in this drama that's all nonsensically ego based and all of this shit that's being kind of pushed out and it's filtering through our consciousness. And then you know, to ban the only thing that can really, we're not the only thing but one of the most powerful tools to realign you. It's just a, it's a recipe for fucking disaster. And it's where we are. Yes. It's one of the things that makes life so interesting though because unfortunately,

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       because look, I like to talk a good game and I love it if everybody was enlightened, but man, it wouldn't be as fun. One, uh, one of the things that's fun about life is that the, there are a bunch of crazy fucks out there that don't get it. And that when you do find people who do get it, whatever, get it means you're, you're appreciate them so much more. It's like you really don't appreciate the light until you see the dark. You really don't appreciate. Cool. And See, hanging out with Douchey. You don't, you know, you don't appreciate generosity until you meet a few cons. You know, and that's, it's unfortunate, but that's real. That's one of the things that makes mushrooms so beautiful is that people don't know. And when you do hit me like how is this possible that this is illegal? How is this possible?

Speaker 3:          02:40:59       This is an on CNN. How is this possible? The front page of the New York Times doesn't say stop everything and do mushrooms. Stop what you're doing. Stop everything. Stop making laws, stopped doing the stock market. Everybody should do mushrooms. Holy Shit. That should be the front page of the New York Times. Stop what you're doing and do mushrooms. They were, if they really wanted to give you news, life changing news, that's the real news. It's, it's, it's the life changing. News is not Justin Bieber got arrested. That's not the life changing news. Life changing news is there's these mushrooms that grow, they grow on cow shit and if you take them, that might be what God is. Bieber if you're listening, I can take you down to Peru with this from my Alaska. He's young. He's about 1819 so whenever he's ready, he's ready. You or I would be dead if we were that kid.

Speaker 3:          02:41:53       He's lucky. He has a minimum amount of testosterone and he weighs 18 pounds because he was, he was a manly man, like an Elvis Presley type dude. A reason why all of us lost fucking mind and pills cause he, he ran out of com. Okay, thanks. They sucked all the come out of his body. So he just started taking pills. Is that dangerous? I guess it is there. You can't fuck everybody. You can. You mean, look, there's a bottom. You know, there's like, there's a comfortable medium. You know, you could be like Bill Clinton, you know, you could be like a serious Dick's linger, but you can't be like Elvis Presley Dang made it to ripe old age. They were allegedly, who knows what it was like hanging around with them. I mean the guy did a lot of crazy shit. Maybe that was why it was launching flaming bodies over the roof.

Speaker 3:          02:42:34       The fucking here's out of cons and crazy and how to calm. The guy was just calming all day long. Constantly. I think when you're there, I mean then by the way, Gingiss existed in an era without Twitter. Good luck pulling all that shit off with Facebook. They'd fucking revolt. Do you know what he's doing? Jesus Christ, but the Bieber thing, it's like this kid is experiencing not just a level of fame that most human beings will never experience. Almost all human beings will never experience 99.9% of famous people will never experience the level of fame that Justin Bieber is on. Not only that, he's doing it in the craziest time

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       ever to be famous. An era where there is just constant 24 hour images coming in of everything you do, every time he drives fast, every time you smoked pot, every time he gets pulled over, every time he gets arrested, every time something crazy happens and he's clearly out of control. He's 19 he's got a half I'll fucking billion dollars in his pocket and he's just running around like a maniac with the Willy Wonka golden ticket. What would, what would anybody expect this kid to do differently? Well, every action needs an equally powerful reaction and I think if you were in that very challenge, I'm not going to deny it's an immensely challenging situation. You got to go fucking overboard. The other way to make sure that you keep some level of sanity or ride that bitch right into the beach. Justin Bieber style smoked pot on airplanes. It's all the pilots have to do fucking oxygen or to stay on the edge.

Speaker 4:          02:44:04       You hear about that? No, he was on a plane and apparently he was smoking so much pot on the plane that the pilots had to put oxygen masks on. Look at the, the FAA is looking into allegations regarding Bieber's flight to New Jersey. The FAA is investigating it cause he was on a private jet and he just started lighting up. He can do whatever he wants. He probably flew naked. The entire trip was probably negative with a hard on. You could probably do it. Viagara and cocaine together. Smoking weed. He's a fucking maniac. And how could he not be? He has got more money than he could ever spend in a thousand lifetimes. And he's 19 and by the way, everywhere it goes, girls literally lose their shit, scream and run at him and try to tear his clothes off and his songs suck. So it doesn't even make any sense.

Speaker 4:          02:44:53       It's not like he's just unbelievable creative force that made these songs that are just, you've got to recognize the genius of this man. I mean, he's the modern Mozart. He's fucking, he's Michelangelo. If he was a singer, he said the art that he produces it at. No, it's terrible. It's terrible, stupid shit. And he sounds like a girl. He sings like a girl. He's touching their inner soul with his own music and they run, they run like fucking World War z just charging at them. You know, even Alexander the great had it would, he was not in perfect in any way, but he had fucking Aristotle, which was one of the greatest minds in the universe as his mentor. You know, to kind of keep that guy in check because he conquered the fucking known world at 25 you know, he had that Justin Bieber s kind of power, even more crazy, more crazy murderer.

Speaker 4:          02:45:47       Yeah. Cause he could do whatever, but he's not going down as Ganga is one of these terrible PBL. I'm sure he wasn't fucking perfect, but he had, you know, he did some sensible acts because maybe you had like one of the greatest mentors of all time and sometimes that fails. Obviously Seneca wasn't very successful with Nero. That thing fucking went straight into the fucking dirt and didn't really work. But I just feel like if someone was some real sense and some good psychedelics could get to him, he could be a fucking powerful force for good. Listen, Willie d from the Geto boys said it best. You got to let a hoby. Oh, okay. He can't fix everybody, man. Don't worry about Justin Bieber. Let's watch, let's watch him ride that fucking chrome Ferrari right over the cliff of life. You know the thing about Alexander the great too, he's gay, you know, so maybe a different motivation.

Speaker 4:          02:46:40       It's that gayish allegedly, probably a bunch of chicks line about him. Fucking him. I mean, he had a boyfriend killed his boyfriend, boyfriends and girlfriends and he just fuck everybody. Fuck they're fucked. Everybody didn't matter. Well maybe he just didn't have as much common as gang as con. Maybe getting his car lasts. I mean obviously didn't because Gingiss con is responsible. Like what does it like fucking 1% of all of Asia is more, it's like five what percentage? Some ridiculous. Yeah. Percentage of the humanity. Yeah. Let's, let's what percentage? Kingus Khan. Yes. Kay. I bet it's like 5%. Okay. Prolific DNA and prize. Okay. Ready for this? This is, this is a real, okay.

Speaker 4:          02:47:24       Wow. Holy Shit. It's one half of 1% of the world today. Roughly 16 million descendants living today. Cause that's not as much as I thought it was. Maybe it'd be more, um, more people in China. Yeah. Higher percentage in those regions. For sure. Thank you. Think about how much he altered the course of history with all the people he killed. Yeah, no shit man. I mean all the blood lines he ended, oh, Jesus. 8% Oh my God. No, it's way more than that. It's one half of 1% is just the world. But uh, it's 8% of people living in one part of Asia. Where is it? What part of his

Speaker 5:          02:48:15       Inner Mongolia,

Speaker 4:          02:48:16       hold on. I'm trying to find, really want to go to Mongolia? Yeah. Well fuck. Yeah, man. It'd be fascinating. I think that, uh, just seeing the wall, the Great Wall would be fucking amazing seeing this area where they were, they were so scared of these fucking terrorists, these savages that they built a giant wall, one of the greatest walls and game of Thrones. Literally. Yeah. 8% of all the males living in the regions of the former Mongolian empire carried a nearly identical y chromosomes, suggesting that they were all direct descendants of gangs. Con.

Speaker 4:          02:48:53       Wow. 8% that's a gangster to the to the nth degree, but it doesn't get any more gangster than him anyway. He's fucking sets the east sets the bar, sets the mark right at the end of gangster. There's gangs cop, and I've said this before, but if you, if you haven't ever listened to it, you've got to listen to Dan Carlin's hardcore history, the wrath of the con in five parts and it's riveting the whole time. He's a bad mother fucker. Dan Carlin is such a bad motherfucker. Hardcore history. If you don't know fucking fantastic, fantastic podcast and that's the, that's the ground. The grand crowning achievement is that Gaviscon series a five part fuck doors. Angels too. It's fantastic. All about Martin Luther and Constantine and the Bible and all the craziness that went on when they were, when they converted the Bible to a phonetic language and the way he sets it up.

Speaker 4:          02:49:48       It's just fucking brilliant man. You have a podcast too, warrior poet, right? Yup. And is it on iTunes? If people can get, do you do a video aspect of it? Sometimes. Sometimes the bents. Yeah, I have. Some of them, a lot of them are on video. And what do you put that? I put that it's usually stays on Ustream. Just kind of lives up there on the, what is the, the Ustream channel. I think it's all homogenous warrior poet us for Facebook, Twitter, you know, everything. That's kind of my handle. So I tried to keep it consistent. Beautiful. So if people can't get enough of Aubrey's delicious tones, go and listen to it. Go download it, check it out. I keep them kind of short too. So I know we got a lot of good material to listen to. I'm in the 30, 45 minute range for most of them.

Speaker 4:          02:50:30       So we get right to it. Well, I don't even flirt. I just pulled the pants down and we go deep. That's how to do it, man. I think, um, I really think that this model of hyperconscious, uh, ethical business like that you're doing with on it and that, you know, we like to support as much as possible when we see outside of on it. I really think it can inspire a lot more likeminded souls. A lot more people. And uh, I think it's, it's really cool that you do this, that you put all this stuff out there, that you put out the blog and then you put out, he marked, you write some really cool blogs and that you put out, you really rarely, I mean, you, you, you, you put not just put the time in it, you put the thought into it and it's all there.

Speaker 4:          02:51:11       It's all real. You know, you're, you're really tapping into whatever the fuck is going on inside your mind and what you're trying to express. And on top of running an awesome company, you know, that's, that's a very admirable thing. And it's also very inspirational and that I think that that tone and that mindset that that spreads, man, that shit is contagious. Well, it's coming from a real place. You know, if I'm, that's what I feel like, I dunno, that's what I feel like I've been my best actualization as all the tools and everything that I've been given is to follow that path. And I like figuring stuff out. I know that I know pretty much nothing. And when I start to find little bits and nuggets and morsels of truth along the way, it's exciting. And then being able to share those and then, you know, not being attached to them either if something else comes up. Cool. You know, just really trying to put the best shit out there and improve the mood of humanity as a whole and show that you can still do

Speaker 3:          02:52:06       this and make money. You can still do this and be successful. Like capitalism doesn't always have to be evil, you know, it can be ethical, it can be conscious, socially conscious. It can be like, it's like friendly capitalism.

Speaker 2:          02:52:16       Yeah. People have a bad taste in their mouth about, you say the Word Corporation and it's just cause the brains of that thing or rot or rotted out. But if you get, you know, good brains and a good conscious and the right kind of motivation behind it, I think you could change people's minds. There's a lot of other ethical companies out there besides on it too. There are, there are. Um, I just, uh, I don't get them on the podcast that month. Yeah, for sure. All right. Uh, I appreciate all you guys who listen and stuff. I mean, some bad motherfuckers really collected, some of the coolest people in the universe are coming, attaching to this momentum and creating this wave. You know, you're a part of all these things that we show on the pockets, these things about weed law, laws being legalized. I mean, your a nugget of consciousness. So many of you that are pushing this forward and that's what we need, you know, will move the needle, you know, as long as soon as the people move the needles themselves. So telling your friends and spreading the word and talking openly, being cool.

Speaker 3:          02:53:09       That's why podcasts like this exist. I mean, the reason why, I mean there's a, there's obviously it's, it's hitting, it's, there's a resonance. It's resonating with people, you know, and that's the only reason why I exist if I did this podcast and then every week it was like, it was fucking terrible. Stop doing it. But I eventually, I'd be like, man, I'm gonna stop doing that podcast. But it beats the positive resonance is, is as much responsible for, uh, these thoughts as anything because it's reinforcing it. I mean, podcast, much like stand up comedy, it's an art form that is meaningless without an audience, without an audience who would just be my edification. It would just be these conversations, which I really appreciate that I could sit down with so many cool people like you or like Cameron Hanes or like, you know, fill in the blank.

Speaker 3:          02:53:52       You don't do it. Graham Hancock, Dr or mid go swami. All these really cool people that I've been able to sit down and talk to the, that would just be for myself, you know? I would've never been able to pull it off though. I wouldn't be able to say, hey, could you sit down and talk with me for three hours? They'd be like, what the fuck am I? I got an earlier dude. I don't even know you man. But because, because I'm going to say, oh blah blah. But everybody else can listen. They go, oh, everybody can listen. Yeah. Yeah. Everybody, the whole world. Billions of people there. All right. All right. Let's talk and then they'll sit down and we'll talk to you. It's a cool thing. So for me, uh, you know, people say thank you for the podcast has been so beneficial. It's changed my life.

Speaker 3:          02:54:29       It's changed my life too. It's been hugely beneficial for me because it's given me this vehicle for exploring these ideas. It's giving me this ability to tap into a million different paths, different information that's coming at me all the time. Different points of view from people that I deeply respect and I don't think the way they think and I get to see the way they think and I wrote, I'm a crier. You know, even people that don't agree with people I do agree with. Like a lot of times people go, oh, you don't fucking call people on their bullshit. Sometimes I don't call people on their bullshit. Sometimes I do, but one of the reasons why I don't, sometimes I want to hear what they're

Speaker 4:          02:55:04       thinking. I instead of constantly judging everything that comes out of people's mouth, my mouth, which I do a lot. What I like to do sometimes is I like to let it play out. I like to hear the full version of it and then consider it or not consider it. You know, there's, there's a million different ways to view this life and there's millions of different eyes to see these things through. And I'm different from you. You're different from me. And together we sort of collectively get, uh, the, we, we get a middle, we get sort of collectively, we get an id of like, what, how's that was a lot of fighters. It might be, Huh, we'll help each other. The only way we're going to ever really get a grip on what the fuck reality itself is, is if we all share our on edited, uncensored opinions on things and let the truth out.

Speaker 4:          02:55:56       Sunlight and fresh air. That's not easy to do, man. It's not easy to do. It's not easy to find. And in this world is a very few opportunities. This podcast has become an opportunity to do that. By sheer luck or not. I mean, maybe it's not. Maybe it's the fucking university, as you said, we're just good. We're just good conduits for something greater. And we just happened to be a well shaped hoes that whatever infor information inspiration can kind of float through and, and that's, and that's it. We'll keep it together. You dirty fucks. Love you all. We love you all. Um, next week we got Monday and mortal, a mortal technique is going to come on the podcast, uh, with a, a gang of friends should be fucking crazy. Molly crab, apple, very talented artist will be here on Tuesday. A Wednesday war machine is going to be here. That should be fun. And, uh, he's awesome of than people give him credit for it. I think that dude's going to open up a lot of people's minds is going to freak people out. And uh, then Joey Diaz, uh, so, uh, that's this week much love. See you soon. Enjoy your Sunday or whatever.

Speaker 6:          02:57:01       Because.
