Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. How much material do you think? I would say if you're going to become a big name standup comedian, you're going to have to put out a bunch of specials. Right? So if you put out how many specials can you do on your life before you have to start talking about other shit? Probably, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:18          or five, four or five specials. Just cause a lot of stuff that I remember it like it was so edit time, like I can laugh at it now, but back then it was paying. So I didn't get all drugs like my sister did. I didn't do, my brother didn't got on drugs to deal with bullshit that we was going through. I just, they, you know, sober thought he mava goes crazy. So to get rid of the pain, I just kept putting it in the back of my head. I didn't want to remember it. So when I became a comic, all of this shit start rushing through my brain and I have to ask my sister, bitch, is this real? I just asked my sister the other day, my granddaddy ran a bootleg house. So in this bootleg house, I had a retarded uncle named uncle cecil that was crippled, but my granddad would buy him pussy on Friday. But me and my sister would have to go in there with a prostitute and hold his legs back until he gets his dicky before we could go outside and play. So I called her up and I said, is this shit real? You get a hold his legs back cause he's a cripple. You know how when they need so he couldn't, we couldn't get it in until we move this fucking legs back. Wow. I remember one time I was like, hurry up probably eight.

Speaker 3:          01:26          I was like, oh go see. So stop fucking smile because they were retarded. He's awful. He's so fucking off. And I asked my brother, I was like, do y'all

Speaker 2:          01:39          limited shit? I'm going crazy and all. I'm like, come on brother. Last weekend I said, my Mama used to have this theory. She's saying when when it rains and the signage shine, the devil was beating his wife. You ever heard of that? Yes. And as you say, if it will rain and the lightning and the song was shot, he caught the beast. Cheeky. He's all season.

Speaker 3:          02:00          You should be the beach. Cause she don't believe in God damn. Talking about you crazy. Somebody I used to think they stole me Joe. And it's fucking crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:16          I am being distracted by how much I have to urinate. Oh, the other day I was thinking about, I'm glad gas just started man. I know, but I was not prepared. I had a water. I drank a whole one of these. Good. And then I had Andre. Yeah. Stay healthy. Uh, and I had a bunch of coffee this morning too, but uh, I was thinking yesterday, this is related. How much would you weigh if you never went to the bathroom? You'd be dead. How quickly? It wouldn't take long. I mean, what if we had evolved to just not ever have to, I like a baby after just a month would be bigger than the biggest human ever. I need to do the math. Well, it depends on what you need to consume. Like, if your body was so efficient that you no longer to urinate, like we kind of assumed that your body would need to urinate.

Speaker 1:          03:02          But why? If your body needs water to stay alive, like what, why are we assuming that it has to protest to get water waste? That it doesn't have one anymore? Well why could, could we just turn that into more hair instead? But why does it have to get rid of waste? Like isn't it possible that we can become so efficient that we no longer need to get rid of waste and we can just sort of exist by breathing completely. Just like self. Yeah. We, I mean to get to a certain size and once we get to a certain size, we just, you know, whatever you evaporate off by walking around like that you have to take back in. Right. I guess, you know? Yeah. Cause they have, you know, robots that that just dissipate heat. They don't have her make a waste product. Your laptop doesn't create as much waste as a human, but it's also not nearly as like complex.

Speaker 1:          03:52          Right. Uh, but in some ways it's more complex. They've been able to make machines that can poop. You put food in and then it's got bacteria and different pumps and reservoirs inside and it creates something that resembles completely and smells just like a human dump. Whoa. The first one I saw was done as a piece of art as art work. Like an artist created this machine that could poop just like a human. And uh, now they do it ad they call it a Robo Gut. It's actually a medical thing because when people have gi problems of poop, transplant is commonly used to reintroduce the healthy bacteria and taking poop from someone else and giving it to the sick person, shoving it up. There is kind of like, you know, there's a lot of possibilities for rejection, infection, stuff like that, I guess. But the Robo Gut can make just perfectly clean poop just with the kind that you want.

Speaker 1:          04:44          Whoa. Yeah. You get some artificial poop put up inside of you to fix any imbalances that you have in your gut flora. That's fast. And that crazy can have like a poop farm of robot intestine, right? That are just, and what do you feed them? Yeah. Digital digitally do burger runs for the Robo guts and then they totally are. It's got to be totally organic. It's got to probably, it's probably just like a paste or a liquid. You'd be like baby food. It wouldn't have to taste good. The robot's not going to complain. Yeah. Fuck that robot. Just eat it, bitch. Well, you remember when Jay z went to Cuban and got in trouble and everything, the media was like, oh look it does he know that that um, fucking che hated black people and you're like, what are you talking about? Like what is going on?

Speaker 1:          05:27          It was the weirdest and Che Guevara Dialing 1964 or something with a Che Guevara. And he also went over to, and Golan fought like the revolution in Africa. So it's like, I don't know if that's really true, but it's just so crazy. He was the perfect guy though. It'd be on a tee shirt. He just looked like such a great revolutionary. I know people that wore a Che Guevara tee shirt that didn't know Jack Shit about, remember there was that wave of Che Guevara support that happened like, like a decade ago or so. I can know one body was really what they were talking about. You could look cool. They have one, a Che Guevara tee shirt on people that Che Guevara Tattoos and it's like, why? What? What about Che fucking Viva La [inaudible]? You know, like the guy and he would have hated it. I mean like the fact that he's become this commercial figure would have been like, he wouldn't fucking hated that. You know, it's just funny that he's become this icon of like capitalism. What's a perfect example of these like surface inquiries? Like people just go to look at it like, oh, that guy was bad ass. No, no, like looking into it at all. No. Trying to understand who he was or knowing like deeply about who he was. Yeah. This is like a baby when you fucking check.
