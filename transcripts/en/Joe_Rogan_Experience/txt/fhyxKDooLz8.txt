We hang out at the comedy store all the time. She was always there. He took me some eyes wide shut party in the middle of the Hollywood hills. We had a. You had to get in an elevator and go to the top of this hill. Yeah, it was Naomi Campbell had his birthday party and so dave's like, hey joe, you want to go with me to this party? And I'm like, dude, I don't, I don't like going to those parties.

Fuck, we uh, we get my portion will go up to the top of this hill, get even more baked, go get, get in a shuttle that takes you up to this dude's house. And some dude who has the sickest house at the top of the Hollywood hill. It's just some crazy billionaire character who has a sick house. And then above his sick house he has a sick party house type. He has just a party house. So you go to the top of this house and he has this fucking insane view of the city where it looks like blade runner, you know, and he's got one 80 degrees of windows. His party house is like a, like a flying saucer that just got stuck in the side of a building.

Speaker 1:          01:36          But the whole outside edge of the flying saucer is all windows. So you're sitting there with all seats around the windows and then he has his big bar and he hasn't. I mean the guy's just closes all loaded with the. And we have to take an elevator, like a foreperson elevator openair elevator that goes up the side of the hill. And as we're going up the side of the hill and Naomi Campbell's naked photo is 40, 50 feet tall and I'm not kidding, I'm not exaggerating, it's just enormous naked photo of Naomi Campbell. And then we get up to the top and it's like fucking demean Moore's there. And I'm saying hi to Lenny Kravitz. I'm like, this is so strange. So high last barbecue barbecued, so, so high. Shouldn't be out in public and up there with all these fucking super rich people. I'm like, what's up lenny?

I was talking to these musicians dudes about mma. It was like I got cornered by all these musicians. Started throwing up fighting this. Oh my God, man. Dude. People get so excited. He gets so excited. They want to start talking mma. I've got a guy who knows. Got Meanwhile, I'm like anything to relax my anxiety right now. I'll tell you all the shit I wake up, write down whatever the fuck you want. Fighters who you know who's gonna win 17 schedule, he was with the part about it, like there was one point in the night. No, Campbell is for a book that she has a book coming out and for. She's very nice too, by the way. Super Nice and beautiful timepiece. One hundred percent. I don't know how old she is. She's got to be 40, right? I would imagine. I say closer to 50. Really? Yeah, because it on the backside. Crawford is 50 now. I think she's 49. I think she's a little older than that. I think she's. She's, she's, she's Naomi Campbell. 40 five. How old is Cindy Crawford? She's probably still just turned 15.

Speaker 1:          03:35          Noemi Campbell. 40 five. Still fucking slamming hot. Right. So anyway, she stops in the middle of this thing. They have this, they have these photos of her. Her book is out and it's this exclusive book that cost like 1500 bucks or something like that to that much. Really big, high glossy. The whole deal. Don't. She just stops and they start taking photos over and she just starts posing. So no one talks. No one's taught like everyone is just watching because it's Naomi Campbell party, so it's almost like Michael Bolton gets out of his party and starts shaking my cell phone, but it's like that. She's doing her thing posing crap. That's how amazing go and there's just. It was a kind of a fascinating little party. It was a good thing to dip my toe into it and get the fuck out of there as quickly as realize why you don't go to those.

Speaker 1:          04:25          Yeah, well it's just, it's they're too famous to famous and it's, it's what it is is to me. It's like, Ooh, don't get that famous for sure. Back off if you didn't get weird. Well, everybody gets weird. It's weird. They're weird people when they have to hang out with each other because nobody else is gonna understand. You know that I was talking to Dave about that. I go, do you like hanging out with celebrities? Because they're the only people that understand what your lives are. He's like, Oh man, but I'm not as famous as them. I go hit the brakes. I go, Dad's party problem. Yup. You don't understand how fucking famous you are. The most famous comedians that's ever lived and one of the most famous celebrities in America, like if there's a 100 list of the most famous people in America in chapels on that. I'm not on that list. I like to stay on the outskirts, that list. I like to be in the suburbs that I don't know Joe. Oh, I think you're in that world, but I'm definitely not. Definitely so right now you're closing in on. You ain't quitting. Slowing down, slowing down and thinking about moving to like Yosemite, which you do that both with Eva.
