Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Ah Ha ha. Four, three, two, one. Boom. Thank you. Thanks for doing this man. Really appreciate it. Hey, welcome. It's very good to meet you. Nice to meet you too. And thanks for not letting this place on fire. You're welcome. Later. How does one, I'm just in the middle of doing all the things you do, create cars or rockets, all this stuff you're doing constantly innovating, decided to just make a flame thrower.

Speaker 2:          00:00:28       Where do you have time for that? Well, the famous Edwin, we didn't put a lot of time into the flame thrower, the, this was an off the cuff thing and um, so have sort of like sort of a sort of a hobby company called the boring company which started out as a joke and we decided to make a real um, and, and dig a tunnel under la and then dig. Then people, other people asked us to dig tunnels and so we said yes in a few cases and then we have a merchandise section that only has one piece of merchandise at a time. And we started off with a cap and there was only one thing on, it was just boring company.com/cap or hat. That's it. And then we sold the hats, limited limited edition, it just said the boring company. And then I'm big kind of space, both the movie and in spaceballs yogurt goes through the merchandising section and they have a flame thrower in the merchandising section of spaceballs. And like the kids love that one. That's the line of when he pulls up the claim for. It's like we should do a flame thrower. So we.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       Does anybody tell, you know, does anybody go elan, um, maybe for yourself, but selling a flame thrower, the liabilities, all the people you're selling this device to what kind of unhinged people are going to be buying a flame thrower in the first place to really want to connect ourselves to all these potential arsonists yeah. It's a terrible idea. Terrible by one. I said, don't buy this flame thrower to buy it. Don't buy it. That's what I said a bit. Still people bought it. Yeah. There's nothing I can do to stop them. You build them. I said, don't buy it. It's a bad idea. How many did you make your w? It's dangerous. It's got, it's wrong. Don't buy it. People bought it. I just couldn't stop them. How many did you make? $20,000 and they're all gone in three, I think four days. It sold out in four days. Are you going to do another run?

Speaker 2:          00:02:52       No, now let's it. Yes. Oh, I said, well do 20 that we did $50,000. 40,000 hats.

Speaker 3:          00:03:01       I'm at. And, and um, that was a million dollars and he's like, okay, well we'll sell something for 10 million and that was 20,000 flame throwers at $500 each. They went fast. Yeah. How do you have the time to do that though? I mean, I understand that it's not a big deal in terms of all the other things that you do, but how do you have time to do anything? I just, I don't understand your time management skills. I mean, I didn't spend much time on this flame thrower. I mean, to be totally frank, it's actually just a roofing torch with an air rifle cover. It's not a real flame thrower, which is why it says not a flame thrower. That's why we were very clear. This is not actually a flame thrower and, and, and it also were told that various countries were, were banned shipping of it would, they would, they would band flame throwers.

Speaker 3:          00:03:56       So we've got to solve this problem for the customs agencies. We labeled it not a flame thrower. That work. Is it effective? I don't know. I think so, yes. So far, yes. Now, but you just said you cannot serve a flame thrower, but you do so many different things and forget about the flame thrower. Like how do you do all that other shit? I'm like, how do you, how do you, how does one decide to fix la traffic by drilling holes in the ground and who do you even approach with that? Like when you have this idea, who do you talk to about that? I mean, I'm not saying it's going to be successful or so, you know, I know it's just like asserting that it's going to be successful, but so far I've lived in La for 16 years and the traffic has always been terrible and so I don't see any other ideas for improving the traffic. Um, so in desperation where you're going to dig a tunnel and maybe that tunnel will be successful and maybe it won't.

Speaker 3:          00:04:59       I'm, I'm listening. Yeah. I'm not trying to convince you it's going to work. And are the people that you or anyone. But you were starting this though. This is actually a project you're starting to implement, right? Yeah. No, we've dug about a mile. It's quite long. Take. Takes a long time to Wolcott yeah. Now when you do in this, what, what is the ultimate plan? The ultimate plan is to have these in major cities in anywhere. There's mass congestion and just try it out in la first. Yeah, it's, it's in La because I mostly live in la. That's the reason as a terrible place to dig tunnels. This is one of the worst places. Dig Tunnels, because the does mostly because of the paperwork you will think. It's like, what about seismic is actually both tunnels are very safe in earthquakes. Why's that? Earthquakes. Earthquakes are essentially of surface phenomenon. It's like waves on the ocean. So if, if, if, if there's a storm, you want to be on the, on in a submarine.

Speaker 2:          00:05:59       So being in a tunnel, it's like being in a submarine. Now the way the towels construct is, it's constructed out of these interlocking segments, kind of like a snake. Um, it's sort of like a snake exoskeleton with a double seals. And so even when the ground moves, the it's able to, the tunnel actually is able to shift along with the ground like an underground snake and it doesn't crack or break or, or, and, and, and it's extremely unlikely that both seals would be broken and it's, it's, it's a capable of taking five atmospheres of pressure. It's waterproof. Methane proof will gas proof of any kind and, uh, meets old California seismic requirements. So when you have this idea, who do you bring this to?

Speaker 4:          00:06:50       I'm not sure what you mean by that. Well when you, you're, you're implementing it, so you're digging holes in the ground like you have to bring it to someone that lets you do it.

Speaker 2:          00:06:58       Yeah. So, um, there were, there were some engineers from space x, um, who were, who thought it would be cool to do this and the guy runs it like day to day. Steve Davis, he's long, longtime space x engineer. He's great. Um, so steve was like, I like to help make this happen. He was like, cool. And so we started off with digging a hole in the ground. It's got like a permit for a pit, a pit, and just dug a big pit.

Speaker 4:          00:07:34       Do you have to tell them what the pits for or you just say, hey, we just want to dig a hole.

Speaker 2:          00:07:38       Nice. Fill out this form. That's it. Yeah, it was a in our parking lot.

Speaker 4:          00:07:45       And, but do you have to give them some sort of a blueprint for your ultimate idea? And do they have to approve it? Like how does that work

Speaker 2:          00:07:51       now? We just started off with a pit big pit and I'm like, you don't, there's not really, you know, they don't really care about the existential nature of a pit. You just say like, I don't want a pit, right? Yeah. And a hole in the ground. So then we got the permit for the pit and we dug the pit and we dug it in like three days, two, three days actually to 48 hours, something like that. Um, cause uh, Eric are steady, was coming by for the hype to, was going to attend the hyperloop competition, which like a student competition we have for a who can make the fastest pod in the hyperloop. And uh, he was coming. This was get the files are going to be on Sunday afternoon. And so, uh, Eric was coming by on Sunday afternoon. He's like, you know, we should take this pit. And then like, sure. Eric. Uh, so we was like Friday morning and then yeah. So it was about a little over 40 hours. Forty hours later we dug the pit. There's like when 24 slash seven or 24 or 48 straight hours, something like and dug this big pit and, and, and we're like showed eric the pit. It's like obviously it's just a pit,

Speaker 1:          00:09:06       but hey, it's holding the ground is better than no hole in the ground. And what do you tell them about this pit? I mean just said this is the starting of this idea. Yes, we're going to build tunnels under la to help funnel traffic better and their girls and they just go, okay. That we've joked around about this in the podcast before too, like what are the person can go to the people that run the city and go, hey, we're going to dig some holes on the ground and puts him tunnels in there. And they go, oh yeah, okay. Now I know where the hole in the ground, but it's people dig holes in the ground all the time. But. But my, my question is like, I know how much time you must be spending on your Tesla factory. I know how much time you must be spending on space x and yet you still have time to dig holes under the ground in La and come up with these ideas and then implement them. Like, I've got a million ideas. I'm sure you just. No shortage.

Speaker 2:          00:09:53       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:09:53       I just don't know how you manage your time. I don't understand it. It doesn't seem. It doesn't even seem humanly possible.

Speaker 2:          00:10:00       You know, I, I do. Basically. I think people like don't totally understand what I do with my time. They think like I'm a business guy or something like that. I'm like, my wikipedia page says, business magnate. What would you call yourself? A business magnet.

Speaker 1:          00:10:18       Please change my wikipedia page to magnet. They'll change right now. He's probably already changed. It's locked. So somebody has to be able to unlock it and change it to magnus.

Speaker 2:          00:10:28       Um, no. I, I do engineering and manufacturing and that kind of thing. That's like 80 percent or more of my time

Speaker 1:          00:10:37       ideas. And then the implementation of those ideas.

Speaker 2:          00:10:39       Yes. That was like hardcore engineering, like designing things, right? Structural, mechanical, electrical, software, a user interface, engineering, aerospace, engineering.

Speaker 1:          00:10:56       But you must understand there's not a whole lot of human beings like you. You know that right? To your an audit teams? Yes. To chimps. Like me, we're all chimps. Yeah, we are. We're wanting to watch one notch above a chimp. Some of us are a little more confused. When I watched you doing all these things and I'm like, how is this motherfucker have all this time and all this energy and all these ideas, and then people just let them do these things

Speaker 2:          00:11:20       because I'm an alien.

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       That's what I've speculated. Yes. I'm on record saying this in the past. I wonder. It's true. I mean if there was one, I was like, if there was like maybe an intelligent being that we created some ai creature that's a superior to people, maybe they just hang around with us for a little while like you've been doing and then fix a bunch of shit. Maybe that's the way my tufts on retainer or something like that. You might. Do you think you do? Probably. Do you wonder like you around normal people, you're like, hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:11:53       Think what's up with these boring dumb mother fuckers ever? Not Bad for a human, but I think it will not be able to hold a candle to ai.

Speaker 4:          00:12:04       Hm. You scare the shit out of me when you talk about Ai between you and Sam Harris. Sure. Consider it until at a podcast with Sam wants. That's great. He made me Shit my pants. Talking about Ai, I realized like, oh well this is a genie that wants out of the bottle. You never get it back in. That's true. There was a video that you tweeted about one of those Boston dynamic robots, like in the future it will be moving so fast you can't see it without a strobe light. You could probably do that right now and no one's really paying attention too much. Other than people like you or people that are really obsessed with technology. All these things are happening and these robots or did you see the one where it. Peta put out a statement that you shouldn't kick robots. It's probably not wise for retribution that their memory is pretty good. I bet. It's really good. It's really good. I bet it is. Yes, and getting better every day. It's really. Are you honestly, legitimately concerned about this? Are you the AI, one of your main worries in regards to the future?

Speaker 2:          00:13:16       Yes, it, it's less of a worry than it used to be a mostly due to taking more of a fatalistic attitude.

Speaker 4:          00:13:25       Hm. So you used to have more hope and you gave up some of it and now you don't worry as much about ai you like this is just what it is.

Speaker 5:          00:13:38       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:13:39       pretty much, yes. But no, it's not necessarily bad. It's just, it's definitely going to be outside of human control. Not necessarily bad, right? Yeah, it's not, it's not necessarily bad, it's just, it's just outside of human control. Now the thing that's going to be tricky here is that it's going to be very tempting to use ai as a weapon. That's going to be very tempting in fact will be used as a weapon. Um, so the, the, the, the onramp to serious ai, the danger is going to be more humans using it against each other. I think most likely that'll be the danger. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:14:28       How far do you think we are from something that can make its own mind up, whether or not something's ethically or morally correct or they're not at wants to do something or whether or not he wants to improve itself, whether or not it wants to protect itself from people or from other Ai. How far away we suffer from something that's really truly sent you in?

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       Well, I mean you could argue that any group of people like like a company is essentially a cybernetic collective of people and machines. That's what a company is

Speaker 2:          00:15:09       and then there are different. There's different levels of complexity in the way these companies are formed and then there are sort of. There's this like a collective ai in, in the google sort of search, Google search, you know the where we're all sort of plugged in as like, like nodes on the network, like leaves on a big tree or in rural rural feeding this network with our questions and answers all collectively programming the ai and the the and Google plus the older humans that connect to it are one giant cybernetic collective. This is also true of facebook and twitter and instagram and all these sorts of networks. The dryness. I haven't had a collectives.

Speaker 4:          00:16:06       Humans and electronics all interfacing and constantly. Constantly connected.

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       Yes, constantly.

Speaker 4:          00:16:15       One of the things that I have been thinking about a lot over the last few years is that one of the things that drives a lot of people crazy is how how many people are obsessed with materialism and getting the latest greatest thing and I wonder how much of that is. Well, a lot of it is most certainly fueling technology and innovation. It almost seems like it's built into us to like what we like and what we want, that we're fueling this thing that's constantly around us all the time and it doesn't seem possible that people are going to pump the brakes. It doesn't seem possible at this stage where we're constantly adding new cell phone, the latest Tesla update the newest macbook pro, but everything has to be newer and better and that's going to lead to some incredible point and it seems like it's built into us. It almost seems like it's an instinct that we were working towards this, that we'd like it our job, just like the ants build the ant hill. Our job is to somehow or another fuel this.

Speaker 2:          00:17:18       Yes, I made those comments some some years ago, but it feels like we are the biological bootloader for ai. Effectively we are building it and then we're building progressively greater intelligence and the percentage of intelligence that is not human is increasing and eventually we will represent a very small percentage of intelligence. But the, the AI isn't formed strangely by the human limbic system. It is in large part our ed writ large. How so? Well, you mentioned all those things, the sort of primal drives. Um, that's all old things that we like and hate and fear. They're all there on the internet, their projection of our limbic system.

Speaker 4:          00:18:32       That's true. Hey, no, it makes sense. Then the thinking of it as a. let me think of thinking of corporations and just thinking of just human beings communicating online through these social media networks as some sort of an organism. That's a, it's a Cyborg. It's a combination. It's a combination of electronics and biology. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:18:53       This is in some, in some measure, the success of these online systems is that is sort of a function of, of how much limbic resonance they're able to achieve with people. The more limbic resonance, the more engagement.

Speaker 5:          00:19:13       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:19:15       Whereas like one of the reasons why probably instagram is more enticing than twitter. Limbic resonance. Yeah. You get more images, more video. Yes. Tweaking your system more. Yes. Do you worry about or wonder in fact of what the next step is? Me. A lot of people didn't see twitter coming that, you know, communicating with 140 characters or 280 now would be a thing that people would be interested in. Like it's going to excel. It's gonna become more connected to us, right?

Speaker 2:          00:19:49       Yes. Things are getting more and more connected there at this point, constrained by bandwidth. Our input output is low, particularly output after got worse with thumbs and where you sort of input with 10, 10 fingers now if thumbs, but images are just are also other way of communicating at high bandwidth. Take pictures and you send pictures people sends. That's, that communicates far more information than you can communicate with them.

Speaker 4:          00:20:18       So what happened with you where you decided or you took on a more fatalistic attitude, like what? Was there any specific thing or was it just the inevitability of our future?

Speaker 2:          00:20:38       I tried to convince people to slow down, slow down ai to regulate ai. This was few I tried for years.

Speaker 4:          00:20:51       See Nobody listened to in a movie. Robots. Good fucking take over and you're freaking me out. Nobody listened. Nobody listens. No one are people more inclined to listen today. It seems like an issue that's brought up more often over the last few years than it was maybe five, 10 years ago. It seemed like science fiction,

Speaker 2:          00:21:10       maybe they will. So far they haven't. I think people don't like the. Normally. The way the regulations work, it was very slow, very slow indeed. So usually it'll be something. Some of your technology will cause damage or death. There will be an outcry. They will be an investigation. You guys will pass. There will be some sort of insights committee. They will be rulemaking than there will be oversight. Eventually regulations. This all takes many years. This is the normal course of things. If you look at say what a motive regulations, how long did it take for seat belts to be implemented to be required? Know the auto industry, fought seat belts, I think for more than a decade, successfully fought any regulations on seat belts, even though the numbers were extremely obvious. If you had a seatbelt on, you will be far less likely to die. It will be certainly entered was unequivocal and the industry fought this for years successfully. Eventually after many, many people died. Regulators insisted on seatbelts. This is a. This timeframe is not relevant to ai. You can't take 10 years from the point at which is dangerous, so late

Speaker 4:          00:22:51       and you feel like this is decades away or years away from being too late. If you have this fatalistic attitude and you feel like it's going, we're in a, almost like a doomsday countdown. It's not necessarily a doomsday countdown. It's, it's a out of control. Countdown

Speaker 2:          00:23:12       control. Yeah. People call it the singularity and uh, that's, that's probably a good way to think about it. Just, it's a singular. It's hard to predict like a black hole, what happens past the event horizon?

Speaker 4:          00:23:23       Right? Sort of once it's implemented, it's very different because it wants to get out of the bottle, what's going to happen and it will be able to improve itself. Pro. Yes. That's where it gets spooky, right? The idea that it can do thousands of years of innovation. We're very, very quickly. Yeah. And then we'll be just ridiculous. Ridiculous. We will be like this ridiculous biological shitting pissing thing trying to stop the gods now stop. We like, we like living with a finite lifespan and watching, you know, Norman Rockwell paintings.

Speaker 2:          00:23:59       It could be terrible and it could be great. It's not clear. Right. But one thing is for sure we will not control it.

Speaker 4:          00:24:07       Do you think that it's likely that we will merge somehow or another with this sort of technology and it will augment what we are now or do you think it will replace us?

Speaker 2:          00:24:23       Well, that's the scenario that the merge scenario with ai is the one that seems like probably the best. Like us. Yes. Like if you, if you can't beat it, join it. That's. Yeah, you know, um, so from a longterm existential standpoint, that's like the purpose of neuro link is to create a high bandwidth interface to the brain such that we can be somebody with ai because we have a bandwidth problem that you just can't communicate through. Your fingers is too slow and whereas neural link at right now,

Speaker 2:          00:25:13       I think we'll have something interesting to announce in a few months that's at least an order of magnitude better than anything else. Probably I think better than anyone thinks is possible. How much can you talk about that right now? I don't want to jump the gun on that. Um, but what's like the ultimate, what's, what's the idea behind it? Like what are you trying to accomplish with it? Like what would you like best case scenario? I think best case scenario we effectively merge with ai where we ais serves as a tertiary cognition layer where we've got the limbic system. I'm kind of the primitive brain. Essentially. You've got the Cortex, so you're currently in a symbiotic relationship with your cortex and limbic system are in a symbiotic relationship and generally people like their cortex and they liked the limbic system. I haven't met anyone who wants to delete their limbic system or delete their cortex.

Speaker 2:          00:26:09       Everybody seems to have like both and the cortex is mostly in service to the limbic system. People may think that that, that they're, that they're thinking part of themselves isn't charged, but it's mostly their limbic system that's in charge and the cortex is trying to make the limbic system happy. That's what most of that computing power is, aren't towards how can I make the limbic system happy? That's what I'm trying to do. Now. If we do have a third layer, which is the ai extension yourself, that is also some biotic, um, and there's enough bandwidth between the cortex and the ai extension of yourself such that the ai doesn't defacto separate, then that could be a good outcome. That could be quite a positive outcome for the future. So instead of replacing us, it will radically change our capabilities. Yes, it will. It will enable anyone who wants to have super human cognition.

Speaker 2:          00:27:19       Anyone who wants this is not a matter of earning power because you're earning power would be vastly greater after you do it. So it's just like anyone who wants to can just do it in theory. That's the theory. And, and if that's the case then and let's say billions of people do it, then the outcome for humanity will be the sum of, of human will, some of billions of people's desire for the future and that, that Koreans have people with enhanced cognitive ability radically enhance. Yes. And which would be at how much different than people today. Like if you, if you had to explain it to a person who didn't really know or understand what you were saying, like how much different are you talking about when you say radically improved? Like what do you mean?

Speaker 2:          00:28:18       You mean mine read or difficult? It will be difficult to really appreciate the difference. Um, it was kind like how much smarter are you with a phone or computer than without? It's, you're vastly smarter. Actually, no, you can answer any question. If you're connected to the Internet, you can ask her any question pretty much instantly, any calculation, uh, the, that your phone's memory is essentially perfect. Uh, you can remember flawlessly or put your phone, can remember videos, pictures and everything perfectly. That's the, that your phone is already an extension of you. You're already a Cyborg. You don't even what most people don't realize they are already a Cyborg. If that phone is an extension of yourself, it's just that the data rate, the rate at which was communication rate between you and the cybernetic extension of yourself that is your phone and computer is slow. It's very slow and that that has like a tiny straw of, of, of information flow between your biological self and your digital self. And we need to make that tiny stroll like a giant river, huge high bandwidth interface, interface, problem, data rate problem, solve the data rate problem. And I think, I think we can hang onto human machine symbiosis through the longterm. And then people may decide that they want to retain their biological self. We're not, I think they'll probably choose to retain their biological self

Speaker 4:          00:30:07       versus some sort of Ray Kurzweil scenario where they download themselves into a computer.

Speaker 2:          00:30:12       You will be essentially snapshot it into a computer at any time. If your biological self dies, you could just probably just upload into a new unit that's really

Speaker 4:          00:30:22       pass that whiskey. We're getting crazy over here. Kind of ridiculous. Down the rabbit hole. Grab that software. Can you tell me that this is too freaky? See if I've been thinking about this for a long time. By the way, I believe if I was talking to one more cheers by the way. Cherished. Okay. This is a great whiskey. Thank you. Know where this came from. Who brought this to us? Trying to remember it. Somebody gave it to us old camp, whoever it was. Thanks. Good. Yeah, it is good. Um, this is just inevitable. Again, going back to your, when you decided to have this fatalistic view points, so you weren't, you tried to warn people. You talked about this pretty extensively. I've read several interviews where he talked about this and then you just sort of just said, okay, just is, let's just end you in a way. You're by communicating the potential. I mean for sure you're getting the warning out to some people.

Speaker 2:          00:31:15       Yeah. Yeah. I mean I was really going on the warning quite, quite a lot. I was wondering everyone I could you ever met with Obama and just put one reason look at? Yes. And what did he say? So what about Hillary? Worry about her first. She didn't know he listened. He certainly listened. Um, I met with Congress. I met with. I was at a meeting of old 50 governors and talked about just a ai danger and I talk to everyone I could. No one seemed to realize where this was going.

Speaker 4:          00:32:05       Is it that or do they just assume that someone smarter than them is already taken care of it? Because when, when people hear about something like Ai, it's almost abstract. It's almost, it's almost like it's so. It's so hard to wrap your head around it. By the time it already happens, it will be too late.

Speaker 2:          00:32:22       Yeah. I think they didn't quite understand it or didn't think it was near term or not sure what to do about it. I said like, you know, an obvious thing to do is to just establish a committee governance

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       committee to gain insight, you know, before, before you oversight, before you do make regulations they should like try to understand what's going on and then if you have an insight committee

Speaker 6:          00:32:53       then the,

Speaker 1:          00:32:54       once they learn what's going on and get up to speed, then they can make maybe some roles for proposed some rules and, and that would be probably a safer way to go about things it seems. I mean I know that it's probably something that the government supposed to handle, but it seems like I wouldn't want the. I don't want the government to handle this. Who Do you want to have one you to handle? Oh Geez. Yeah. I feel like you're the one who could ring the bell better because if, if Mike pence starts talking about Ai, I'm like, shut up bitch. You don't know anything about Ai. Come up, man. He hasn't. Nobody's talking about anything, but I don't have the power to regulate other companies. What am I supposed to? Maybe companies could agree. Maybe good. There could be some sort of a way. I mean there's. We have agreements where you're not supposed to dump toxic waste into the ocean. You're not supposed to do certain things. It could be terribly damaging even though there'll be profitable. Maybe this is one of those things. Maybe we should realize that you can't hit the switch on something that's going to be able to think for itself and make up its own mind as to whether or not it wants to survive or not and whether or not it thinks you were a threat

Speaker 1:          00:33:58       and whether or not it thinks you're useless. Like why do I keep this dumb, finite life form alive? Why? Why keep this thing around? It's just stupid. It's just keeps polluting everything she ever wear. Co's, lighting everything on fire and shooting each other. Why would I keep this stupid thing alive? Because sometimes it makes good music. You know? Sometimes it makes great movies. Sometimes it makes beautiful art and sometimes you know, sometimes it's cool to hang out with my reasons. For us, those are great reasons, but for anything objective, standing outside like, oh, this is definitely a flawed system. This is like if you went to the jungle and you watch these chimps engage in warfare and beat each other with sticks, they're fucking really fucking mean. The real. So that movie chimpanzee. Yeah, that was gonna be like some. There's anything. I was like, holy cow, what movie was that?

Speaker 1:          00:34:42       It looks really cool. Chimpanzee, who is it? A documentary? Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like a documentary. I was like, damn, these chimps are mean. They're mean, they're cruel. They're calculated. Yeah. Yeah. They sneak up on each other and like, I didn't realize chimps did calculator. Cruelty. Yeah. It's pretty left that meeting. Kind of like game over. This is dark, right? Well, we know better because we've advanced, but if we hadn't, we'd be like, man, I don't want to fucking live in a house. I like the champ ways, bro. Chimp ways to go. This is it man. Chimp life right now, but we in a way to the AI might be like those chimps, like these stupid Fox launching missiles out of drones and shooting each other underwater. Like we're crazy. We got torpedoes, submarines and fucking airplanes that drop nuclear bombs indiscriminately on cities were assholes too.

Speaker 1:          00:35:43       Yeah. They might go, why are they doing this? It might like, look at our politics, look at what we do in terms of our food system, what kind of food we forced down each other's throats, and they might go this. These people are crazy. Didn't even look out for themselves. I don't know. How much do we think about chimps? Not much. Very little. It's like these chimps are at war. They look like groups of chimps just attack each other and they kill each other and they torture each other. That's pretty bad. Um, they hunt monkeys there, but like, this is probably the most. But you know, I mean, when's the last time we talked about chimps but me all the time. If you do talk to the podcast episode, people are laughing right now. Yeah, constantly. I'm obsessed. I saw that David attenborough documentary on Champs when they were eating those calibus monkeys and ripping them apart that many, many years ago, and it just changed how I go, Oh, this is why people are so crazy. We came from that thing. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I got a better philosophy. Yeah. They like swingers. Yeah, they really are. They're they. They seem to be way more even than us. Way More civilized. They just seemed to resolve everything with sex. The only rules they have as the mom won't bang the Sun. That's it. Okay. That's it. Mom. I'll bring your sons. They're good women. Good women in the community. Everybody else is banging it out. Yeah. I haven't seen the Lenovo movie.

Speaker 1:          00:37:24       Well, they're disturbing just at a zoo. Benobos at the zoo. They just constantly going constantly. Fucking boring stuff. Yeah, and they don't care. Gay, straight, whatever. Let's just fuck. I haven't seen was at a zoo s probably like the PGA section. Yeah, I don't think they have them at many zoos. We've looked at it before. It was probably pretty awkward. I think that's the thing that they like to keep regular chimps at zoos because Benomo was just always jacking off and what's that they have in San Diego has got some really interesting, probably separate them. How many other in a cage? It's going to be pretty intense. We'll go. Yeah, we're were a weird thing, you know, and I've often wondered if whether or not we're, you know, our ultimate goal is to give birth to some new thing and that that's why we're so obsessed with technology because it's not like this technology is really. I mean it's certainly enhancing our lives to in a certain way, but I mean ultimately is it making people happier right now? Most technology I would say no. In fact, you and I were talking about social media before this, about just not having instagram on your phone and not dealing with you feel better. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       I think that one of the issues with social media that's been pointed out by many people is that, um, I think maybe particularly instagram, um, people look like they have a much better life than they really do. Right? So by design. Yeah. People are posting pictures of when they were really happy there are modifying those pictures to be better looking if they're not modifying the pictures there, at least selecting the pictures for the best lighting, the best angle. So people basically seem I'll, they're way better looking than they basically really are. And they're way happier seeming than they really are. So if you look at everyone on Instagram, you might think, man, they're always happy, beautiful people and I'm not that good login and I am not happy, so I must suck, you know. And that's gonna make people sad. So when in fact those people you think are super happy, actually not that happy. Some of them are really depressed. They're very sad.

Speaker 2:          00:39:46       So my happiest people actually some of the saddest people in reality. Um, and, and, and nobody looks good all the time. It doesn't matter who you are. No, it's not even something you should want. Why do you want to look great all the time. Yeah, exactly. So, uh, so I think, I think things like that can make people quite sad when you just, just by comparison because you, you just sort of, you people, people generally think of themselves relative to others. It's, it's, uh, we're constantly re, we baselining our expectations. Um, and you can see the, if you watch some show like naked and afraid or if you're just going to try living in the woods by yourself for awhile in, you, like the learn that civilization was quite great. It has a lot of people want to come back to civilization pretty fast on naked and afraid. Wasn't that a thoreau quote? The comparison is the thief of joy of happiness is reality minus expectations.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       That's great too. But the comparison is the thief of joy really holds true to peep. Is it they don't. Roosevelt Roosevelt Fascinating, um, in, when you think about instagram, because would essentially instagram is with a lot of people is you're giving them the opportunity to be their own pr agent and they always go towards the glamorous, you know, and whenever anybody does show Hashtag no filter, they have, they really do do that. Like, oh, you're so brave. Look, you don't make up now they look good. Anyway. You look great. What are you doing? Oh my God. You don't have makeup on and still a hot as fuck. You know what you're doing. I know what you're doing to. They're there. They're letting you know and then the feed off that comment section. Woo. Just a little bit sitting there like, look, it's a fresh stream of love, like you getting right up to the sources that comes out of the earth and just suck in that water.

Speaker 1:          00:41:41       Emojis, emojis. Yeah. A lot of allergies. My what? My concern is not so much what instagram is, is that I didn't think that people had the need for this or the expectation for some sort of technology that allows them to constantly get love and adulation from strangers and comments and this ability to project this sort of distorted version of who you really are, but I worry about where it goes. Like what's the next one? What's the next one? Like, where is it? Is it going to be augmented in some sort of a weird augmented or virtual sort of instagram type situation where you're not going to want to live in this real world, you're going to want to interface with this sort of world that you've created through your social media page and some next level thing. Go live in the simulation? Yeah, maybe in the simulation ready player one type shit that's real.

Speaker 1:          00:42:32       That seems. We have that htc vive here and I've only done it a couple times quite honestly because it kind of freaks me out. My kids fucking love it, man. They love it. They love playing these Weirdo Games and walking around with that headset on. But part of me watching them do it goes, wow, I wonder if this is like the precursor, just sort of like if you look at that phone, that Gordon Gekko hat on the beach and compare that to like a galaxy note nine. Like how the fuck did that become that? Right? And I wonder when I see this htc vive and my, what is that thing gonna be 10 years from now when we're making fun of what it is now, what is it? How? I mean, how ingrained and how, how, how connected and interconnected is this technology going to be in our life?

Speaker 2:          00:43:21       It will be at some point indistinguishable from reality

Speaker 1:          00:43:27       where we'll lose this or lose this. Like you and I just looked at each other through our eyes. I see you where you see me, I think. I hope you think so. I think you probably have read it. Regularize. This could be some simulation. It could. Do you entertain that?

Speaker 2:          00:43:43       Well, the argument for the simulation I think is quite strong because if you assume any improvements at all over time, any improvement, one percent point one percent. Just extend the timeframe. Make it a thousand years, a million years. The Universe is 13 point 8 billion years old. What civilization, if you counted, if you're very generous, civilization is maybe seven or 8,000 years old. If you counted from the first writing. This is nothing. This is nothing. So if you assume any rate of improvement at all, then games will be indistinguishable from reality or civilization

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       will end one of those two things will occur. We are most likely in a simulation

Speaker 1:          00:44:40       or we're on our way, right? Well, we could most certainly be on the road. We could be on the road, did that, right? It doesn't mean that it has to face reality. It could be in base reality. We could be here now on our way to the road or on her way to the destination where this can never happen again, where we are completely ingrained in some sort of an artificial technology or some sort of a symbiotic relationship with the internet or the next level of sharing information. But right now we're not there yet. That's possible too, right? It's possible that a simulation is one day going to be inevitable, that we're going to have something that's indistinguishable from regular reality, but maybe we're not there yet. That's also possible.

Speaker 1:          00:45:24       We're not quite there yet. That this is real. When I touched that feels very real. Maybe that's why everybody's like getting to like mason jars and shit. Mason's suede shoes people wear to like craft restaurants and they wouldn't want raw wood. Everyone says everyone else. See Metal people. It seems like people are like longing toward some weird log cabin type. Nostalgia reality. Yeah. Like holding on like clinging to her, dragging their nails through the mud. Like don't take me a yes, but then. But then people will go get a mason jar with the Weinstein or handle

Speaker 3:          00:45:58       that's dark.

Speaker 1:          00:46:00       Makes me lose faith in humanity. Wind Stamina, handle. They have those. Oh that's dirty. People are just assholes. That's like, people make pet rocks rough. Right? There's some people are just assholes. They take advantage of our, our, our generous nature. It was made with the Weinstein made with handle. They made it that way. So the, onto the mace. Ah, you thought that would be fine if there was like glued it on or something, but it was made that way. White trash chic. Oh, this is disgusting. This. Here it is right there. Yup. This is terrible.

Speaker 3:          00:46:35       Yeah. That's like fake breasts that are designed to be hard. Like fake breasts from the sixties.

Speaker 1:          00:46:45       It's like if you really long for the ones with ripples, here we go.

Speaker 3:          00:46:49       Yeah. That's almost what that is. Yeah. What are you going to do, man? It's not nothing. It's not need to stop certain terrible ideas from propagating. Yeah. Um, anyway, I, I don't want to sound like, like thanks for too dark because I think like, you kind of have to

Speaker 3:          00:47:09       be optimistic about the future. There's no point in being pessimistic. It's just too negative. Does this, it doesn't help, you know, I think you want to be. I mean, my theory is like you'd rather be optimistic. I think I'd rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and. Right. Right. Police around that side. Right. Yeah. Because if, if you're pessimistic is going to be as miserable. Yeah. Yeah. And nobody wants to be around you anyway. If it's the end of the world, you know, like I told you, Bro. Yeah. The world's ending. Yeah. It is what it is. Enjoy the journey. Right? If you really want to get morose, I mean, it is what it is for all of us anyway. We were all going to go unless something changes. Yeah, I mean ultimately, you know, even if we just sort of existed as humans forever, we'd be with still eventually, that'd be like the heat death of the universe, right? Israelian years from now, right now if we get it past the sun, if we figured out a way past the son running out of juice, eventually it's going to end. It's just a question of when. Right? So it really is all about the journey or transcendence from whatever we are now into something that doesn't worry about death.

Speaker 3:          00:48:27       The universe as we know it will dissipate into a fine mist of cold. Nothing this eventually, and then someone's going to bottle it and put a fragrance to it, sell it to French people in another dimension. So it's a very long time. So I think it's really just about how can we make it last longer. Are you a proponent of the multiuniverse theory? Do you believe that there are many, many universes and that even if this one fades out, that there's other ones that are starting fresh right now and there's an infinite number of them, they're just constantly in this never ending cycle of birth and death.

Speaker 3:          00:49:08       I think most likely, this is just about probability. There are many, many simulations, these simulations or we might as well call them reality or you could call them the multiverse. These simulations you believe are created like someone has managed running on a substrate, so that substrate is probably boring, boring. How so? Well, when we create a simulation like a game or a movie, it's a distillation of what's interesting about life. You know, like it, it takes, it can take a year to shoot an action movie and then that's all distilled down into two or three hours. So let me tell you, if you see an action movie being filmed, frigging boring, super boring takes. There's lots of takes those. Everything's in a green screen, looks pretty goofy, doesn't look cool, but once you add the CGI and have great editing, it's amazing. So I think most likely if we're a simulation, it's really boring outside the simulation because why would you make simulation that's boring because it makes simulation way more interesting in the base reality that is if this right

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       now is a simulation and ultimately inevitably we're, if as long as we don't die or get hit by a meteor, we're going to create some sort of simulation if we continue on the same technological path we're on, we're on right now, but we might not be there yet. So it might not be a simulation here, but it most likely is you feel other places, this notion of place or where is a flawed, flawed perception like that if you have this sort of, but a vive, which that's made by valve and steam and it's really valve that made it. HDC did the hardware, but it's really evolved thing. Um, makers of Halflife yes, a great company. Great Company.

Speaker 6:          00:51:21       Hmm. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:51:26       when you're in that, in that, in that virtual reality, which is only going to get better, where are you? Where are you really? Right? You aren't anywhere. Well, whereas in the computer, what you know, what defines where you are exactly right. It's your perception is your perceptions or is it a scale that we have under your butt. You right here, I've measured you. You're the same weight as you were when you left. Meanwhile you're experienced. Do you think you're where you are right now? You might not be. I'll spark up a joint. If you keep talking to your manager's gonna, come in here. We might have to lock the door right now. You think you're in a studio in la? That's what I heard. You might be in a computer. Oh, medicine. Man, I think about this all the time. Yeah, I mean it's unquestionable that one day that'll be the case.

Speaker 1:          00:52:14       As long as we keep going, as long as nothing interrupts us, and if we start from scratch and you know we're single celled organisms all over again and then millions and millions of years later would become the next thing that is us with creativity and the ability to change the environment. It's going to keep monkeying with things until it figures out a way to change reality to change, I mean almost like punch a hole through what is this thing into what, what it wants it to be and create new things and then those new things will intersect with other people's new things and then it will be this ultimate pathway of infinite ideas and expression all through technology.

Speaker 6:          00:52:56       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:57       And then we're wondering, we're going to wonder like why are we here? What are we doing? Let's find out why. I mean, I think we should take the actions, the set of actions that are most likely to make the future better. Yes. Right. Yeah. Right, right. And then reevaluate those actions to make sure that they're there. That it's true. Well, I think there's a movement to that. I mean, in terms of like a social movement, I think some of it's misguided and some of it's exaggerated and there's a Lotta, a lot of people that are fighting for their side out there, but it seems like the general trend of like a social awareness seems to be much more heightened now than it's ever been in any other time in history because of our ability to express ourselves instantaneously to each other through facebook or twitter or what have you, and that the trend is to abandon preconceived notions, abandoned prejudice, abandoned discrimination, and promote kindness and happiness as much as possible. Looking at this knife. Somebody gave it to me. Sorry. What the fuck did you do? My friend Dani. I brought this with him and it just stayed here. I have a real Samurai sword. Fun To play with that. I know you're into weapons. That's from the 15 hundreds. Samurais or at the end of the table. Yeah. That's cool. I'll grab it.

Speaker 5:          00:54:18       Hold on.

Speaker 1:          00:54:27       Yeah, that's a Legit Samurai sword from an actual Samurai from the 15 hundreds. If you pull out that blade, that bleed was made the old way. Where a master craftsman folded that metal and hammered it down over and over again over a long period of time and honed that blade into what it is now. What's crazy is that more than 500 years later, that thing is still pristine.

Speaker 1:          00:54:54       I mean, whoever took care of that and pass it down to the next person who took care of it and you know, til it got to the podcast room, it's pretty fucking crazy. Yeah. One day someone's going to be looking at a tesla like that [inaudible]. He's fucking back doors. They pop up sideways like a Lamborghini. You should see what tesla can do. Uh, you didn't. You should. I'll show you after driven one. I love them. Yeah. But most people don't know what it can do in terms of like ludicrous mode in terms of like driving super fast and irresponsibly on public roads is that were saying why do you call it can do that. Yeah. What can it do that,

Speaker 1:          00:55:37       that I need to know about having the model x can do this like ballet thing to the Trans Siberian orchestra. It's pretty cool. We're at dances if legitimately like moves you out to that. Why would you program that seemed like fun. That's what I get about you. That's what's weird. Like when you showed up here, you were all smiles and you pull out a fucking blow torch and not a blow torch, but I'm like looking at the flame thrower, not a flame thrower, Mike. It's definitely not like you're having fun. Like this is a like this thing when you know your program, a car to do a ballet, dance, fun. How do you have the time to do that? I don't understand why you're digging holes under the earth. Incentive rockets into space and and

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       power in people in Australia. Like how the fuck do you have time to make the car dance ballet? Well, I mean, in that case there were some engineers at Tesla that said, you know what? If we make this car dance and play music, I was like, that sounds great. Let's do it. Let's try to get it done in time. For Christmas. We did. Is there a concern about someone just losing their mind and making do that in the highway? Now it wouldn't do that. What if it's in bumper to bumper traffic? Nope. No, won't do it. Nope. It's actually you have to just an Easter egg. Oh, it's an Easter egg. That's why people don't know about it. You put it here. We'll have the car. It can do lots of things. Lots of things. Once reddit gets a hold of it, everyone's, Oh, you just have to everyone. If you search for it on the Internet, you will find out. But people don't know that they should even search for it. Oh, well they do now. Yes. Yes. There's so many things about the model x and the model s and the model three that people don't know about. We should probably do a video or something it and explain it because I have close friends of mine and I say, do you know the call can do this? And they're like, nope.

Speaker 3:          00:57:41       Do you want to do a video though? Do you like the fact that some people don't know? No, I think it's probably not. We should tell people. Yeah, probably. Yes. That would help your product. I mean, it's not like you don't sell enough of them, you sell almost too many of them.

Speaker 7:          00:57:56       Right. The,

Speaker 3:          00:58:00       I mean I think at Tesla is the most fun thing you could possibly buy ever. That's what it's meant to be. Well, our goal is to make. It's, it's not exactly a car. It's actually a thing to maximize enjoyment. Make maximum fun. Okay. Electronic like big screen, laptop, ridiculous speed handling, all that stuff. Yeah. Do you have. And you're going to put video games in it? You are? Yeah. Is this wise? Well, what you won't be able to drive while you're playing the video game, but we're like, for example, we just, we're just putting the, the Atari emulator rom memory later in it, so we'll play missile command and Lunar Lander and a bunch of other things. Oh yeah, that sounds cool. It's pretty fun. I like that. Yeah. And we improved the interface of missile command because it's too hard with the old track bull. So this is the touchscreen version of missile command. So you have a chance. Do you have an old car? Don't you? Don't you have like an old Jaguar? Yeah. That. That's. That's a 61 series. Warranty type Jagger. I love cars. It's great. Yeah. I love old cars. Yeah. The only two, only two. Your gasoline cars I have about that. And,

Speaker 5:          00:59:27       and

Speaker 3:          00:59:28       old Ford, like a Ford model t that a friend of mine gave me my only to gasoline cars is the Ford model t all stock. Well there's your car. Ooh, look ahead with the convertible. That is a gorgeous. Our God. That's a good looking car. Yes. Is that yours? That is. It's not mine. It's extremely close to mine that I don't have a front license plate or mine. Oh, that's a beautiful car. They knew that. That's mine. Looks like that. God. They nailed that. That's what mine looks like. Very good. Is Money. There's certain iconic shapes.

Speaker 5:          01:00:02       Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:00:04       And there's, there's something about those cars too. They're not as capable, not nearly as capable as like a tesla, but there's something really satisfying about the mechanical aspect of feeling the steering and the grinding of the gears and the shifting. There's something about those that's extremely satisfying even though they're not that competent. Like I have a 19, 93 porsche nine slash six four. It's like a lightweight. It's not as rs America. It's not very fast. It's not like in comparison to a tesla or anything like that, but the thing about it is like it's mechanical feel of everything.

Speaker 3:          01:00:43       It's. It gives you this weird thrill, like you're on this clinky ride and this all this feedback. There's something to that. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, yeah, one type is like basically no electronics. It's just you like that, but you also like electronics. Yes. Like your teslas soup. It's like the far end of electronics. Yes. Drives itself. It's driving itself better every day. Yeah. It's like we're about to release the software that will enable you to just turn it on and it'll drive from highway on, ramp to a highway, exit through lane changes to overtake other cars to go from one interchange the next. If you get on, say the four or five, get off, get off 300 miles later and go through several highway interchanges and to overtake other cars and hook into the NAV system. And then um, and you just meditating.

Speaker 1:          01:01:42       Oh

Speaker 3:          01:01:44       yeah. Because just traveling very kind of eerie kind of eerie. What did you think when you saw that video? That dude fallen asleep behind the wheel and I'm sure you've seen it. The one in San Francisco is like, right outside of San Jose, out cold like this and the car interpreter bumper traffic moving along. Or have you seen it right? Yeah, yeah, we changed the software. That's I think an old video which has software where if, if you don't touch the wheel, it will gradually slow down and put the emergency lights on and wake you up. Oh, that's hilarious. That's hilarious. Can you choose what voice wakes you up? Well, it sort of more of a. it's sort of honks honking. This should be like wake up fuck face. Well, bringing your fellow humans. We could, we could gently wake you up with a sultry voice. Oh, that would be good.

Speaker 3:          01:02:32       Like a, something with a southern accent. Hey, why can't wake up sunshine? Hey Sweetie. Thank you. Exactly. Why don't you wake like, pick. You could pick your right like you want. Yeah. I choose the Australian girl for Siri. Yeah. Take her voice. Do you want it to seductive? Favorite Australian? What? Flavor of do what you want it to be angry. It could be anything. You want those Australian prison lady genes. Now when you, um, when you program something like that in, is this in response to a concern or is it your own? If you look at it and go, Hey, I'm. They shouldn't just be able to fall asleep. Wake him up.

Speaker 3:          01:03:08       Yeah. Yeah. We like know, we're like, well, you know, people falling asleep. We were about to do something about that. Right? But when you first released it, you didn't consider it, right? You just like, well no one's going to just sleep. People fall asleep in cars all the time. Let's crash. Yeah. At least our car doesn't crash. That's better. It's better not to crash. Imagine if that God falling asleep in a, in a gasoline car. They do all the time for sure. Yeah. And it crashed and somebody. Yeah. And in fact, the thing that really got me to, it's like, man, we better get on autopilot going get it out. There was a guy who was in an early Tesla driving down the highway and he fell asleep and he ran over a cyclist and killed them and cycles like, man, if we had the autopilot wouldn't run out of the one. He might have fallen asleep, but at least he wouldn't run over that cyclist.

Speaker 3:          01:04:04       So how did you implement it? Like did you just use cameras in programmed with the, the, the system so that if it sees images it slows down. And how much time do you give as the person who's in control of it allowed to program how fast it goes? Yes. Yeah. You can program it to be more or less like more conservative or more aggressive driver. Um, and uh, you can say what speed you want it to, what, what speed is. Okay. I know you have ludicrous mode. Do you have douchebag mode? Well, it was just cuts people off well for four lane changes. That's tricky because if you're in like La, like in last year, pretty aggressive, right? It's pretty. It's hard to change lanes sometimes. It's hard to be sot nom. It's hard to be numb day on here in La. You get, if you want to hit that Santa Monica Boulevard off ramp. I mean you got to be a little pushy. You got to be a little pushy. Yeah. Especially if you're angry, a little angry. They don't want you in this speed up sometimes. You know. I think people like overall a pretty nice when the highway even in la, but sometimes they're not. Do you think the neurological health that probably everybody would

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       be locked in together as hive? Mind tunnels will help it. We're going to have traffic that'll help a lot. Yeah. How many of those can you put in there? That's a nice thing about tunnels as you can go through Edi. So many levels. Right? So until you hit hell. Yeah, but you could go. You could have 100 levels of tunnel. Their bombs. Jesus Christ. I don't want to be a 99 man. It'd be the 99th, negative 99 floors. Cool.

Speaker 2:          01:05:45       This is one of the fundamental things people don't appreciate about tunnels is that there's not like roads. The fundamental issue with roads is that you have a tutee transport system and a three d living in workspace environment. So you've got all these tall buildings or, or concentrated work environments and, and then then you want to go into this like tootie transport system, which usually in a pretty low density because cars are spaced out pretty far. Um, and, and so that obviously is not going to work. You're going to have traffic guaranteed. But if you can go three D on your transport system, then you can solve all traffic and you can either go 3d up with a flying car or can go through ed down with tunnels and you can have as many tunnel levels as you want and you can arbitrarily relieve any amount of traffic. You can go further down with tunnels. Then you can go up with buildings. You're 10,000 feet down if you want.

Speaker 1:          01:06:45       I wouldn't recommend it, but what was that movie with? What's his face? The Bradley Cooper. Not Bradley Cooper. A Christian. Now what the fuck is his name? Who Was Batman? Christian Bale. Where he. They fought dragons. Him and Matthew Mcconaughey went down deep into the earth. How high? How deep can you go up man, but yeah, it was. It was meant for dragons. Batman, but Christian Bale Reign. A fire ring of fire. Never saw that. No, but good. I wouldn't recommend saying super far down. Right? Molten. We're. Yeah. Earth is a giant bowl of lava

Speaker 2:          01:07:25       with a thin crust on the top, which we think of as like the surface, this thin crust and it's mostly just a big ball of lava

Speaker 1:          01:07:36       that's earth, but 10,000 feet. It's not a big deal. Have you given any consideration whatsoever to the flat Earth Movement thought? I think that's a troll situation. Oh, it's not. No, it's not. You would like to think because you're a super genius, but I as a normal, normal person, I know there's people way dumber than me and they really, really believe. They watch youtube videos which go on uninterrupted and spew out a bunch of fucking fake vacs very eloquently and articulately and they really believe these people. Really. I mean,

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       if it works for them,

Speaker 7:          01:08:17       sure,

Speaker 3:          01:08:20       fine, fine. Weird that right. That in this age where you know it was ludicrous mode and your car goes one point nine seconds. Zero to 62 point two, two point two. Which one's one point nine? The poster. The next generation roadster. Certain standard edition. Yeah. I'm on top of this shit. That's the standard edition. So throughout the performance package, what performance package? What the fuck do you need me to put rocket thrusters on it? For Real? What are they going to burn? I think high ultra high pressure. Compressed air. Well, just cold gas thrusters new. Do you have to have air tanks? Are they sucking the air out? Okay? Yeah, just electric pump. Whoa. Pump it up like 10,000 PSI. And how fast are we talking? Zero to 60. How fast you want to go to go? Could make it fly. I want to go back in time to make it fly.

Speaker 3:          01:09:14       You make it fly? Sure. Do you anticipate that as being me, you were talking about the tunnels and then flying cars, do you really think that's going to be real too noisy and this too much air flow so that the fundamental issue with flying cars, I mean I forget what one of those like toy drones, I think of how much, how loud those are and how much air that. How much air they blow. Now imagine if that's like a thousand times heavier. This is not going to be make your neighbors happy. Your neighbors are not going to be happy. If you land a flying car in your backyard, it will be very helicopter or on your roof. They're just really going to be like, what the hell that it was annoying. You can't even look. If you want a flying car, just put some wheels on a helicopter. Is there a way around that? Like what if they figure out some sort of magnetic technology, like all those Bob Lazard type characters were thinking that was a part of the UFO technology they were doing at area 51. Remember, didn't they have some, some thoughts about magnetics? Nope, no bullshit. Yes. Really? Yeah. It was a fundamental momentum exchange with the air, so you must.

Speaker 3:          01:10:23       You must accelerate your business like this. There's a certain. You have a mess and you have gravity, gravitational acceleration and mass mass times your mass times gravity must equal the massive air flow times the acceleration of that f flow to have a neutral force, so it's impossible to go around and then you won't move. If FMG is greater than you will go down and if mas greater than mg you will go up. That's how it works. There's just no way around that. There is definitely no way around it. There's no way to create some sort of a magnetic something or another that allows you to technically yes, you you could have a strong enough magnet,

Speaker 3:          01:11:11       but that magnet would be strong, that you would create a lot of trouble. We just suck cars up in your car. Just pickup. I mean, you'd have to repel off of either a material on the ground or in a really nasty situation off of Earth's gravitational field and somehow make that incredibly light, but that magnet would cause so much destruction. You'd be better off with a helicopter. So if there was some sort of magnet road, like you have two magnets and they repel each other. If you had some sort of a magnet road that was below you and you could travel on that magnet road, that would work.

Speaker 3:          01:11:59       Yes. Yes. You could have a magnet road, a magnet road because that too. Ridiculous. No, it's ridiculous to. Right. I would not recommend it. There's a lot of things I don't recommend or not recommend that not good. Not Wise. I think no roads. No, no that. No, definitely not. Definitely not. I was good. I would cause a lot of trouble. So you've put some time and consideration into this other than, you know, instead of like my foolishly rendered thoughts. So you think that tunnels of the way to do it? Oh, it'll work for sure. That'll work. Yes. And your, these, these tunnels that you're building right now, these are basically just like test versions of this ultimate idea that you have, you know, it's just a hole in the ground, right? We played videos of it where you're going to drop that hole in the ground, there's a sled on it and the sled goes very fast.

Speaker 3:          01:12:56       Like 100 miles an hour plus. Yeah, you can go real fast, fast as you want. And then if you want to go long distances you can just grow the air out of the tunnel, make sure it's real straight. Draw the air of the tunnel. Yeah. So vacuum tunnel, um, because the. And then depending on how fast you wanna go, you can either use wheels or you could use air bearings depending upon the ambient pressure in the tunnel. Or You could a maglev it if you want to go super fast. So magnet road, yes, but underground magnet roads, underground magnet, otherwise you're going to really create a lot of trouble with because those metal things. So magnet rose the way to go. Just underground. Do you want to go really fast? Underground? You would be in a, you would be maglev in a vacuum tunnel, mag in a vacuum tunnel, magnetic levitation in a backroom, tunnel entrance. Fun with rocket launchers. Now I would not recommend putting any exhaust gas in the tunnel. Oh, okay. I see what you're saying because then you have to pump it on, right? You have to pump it out and you probably have a limited amount of air in the first place. Like how much can you breathe? Do you have to pump oxygen into these cubicles of the pressurized pod and be like, like a little tiny underground. Basically

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       like an airplane because you have a or an airplane. It's not getting new Aaron. It is. It is, yes. We have like a little hole. Yeah, they have a pump. Really? Yeah. It gets it from the outside. Yes. Wow. I didn't know that was like, it's the airplanes have it. Have it easy because essentially you can. They're pretty leaky but Jesus. Yeah, but so long as they. As long as the air pump is working at a decent speed, they have backup pumps. Still have like three pumps to four pumps or something and uh, and then that, then there's like, there's, it exhausts through the outflow valve and, and through whatever seals are not feeling quite right. Usually the door doesn't feel quite right on a plane. This was a bit of leakage around the door and uh, but the, the pumps a exceed the flow rate and then that sets the pressure in the, in the cabin.

Speaker 2:          01:15:07       Now, have you ever looked at and gone, I can fix this, but I just don't have time as you make them a design for a plane, you do a better design. I mean probably I think it is. Well, have you talked to about this and I've talked to friends, friends, friends and family, friends, girlfriends, and you can tell me what do you got? What's going on? Well, I mean the exciting thing to do would be some sort of electric vertical takeoff and landing supersonic, jet up, some kind of vertical takeoff and landing mean no need for runway. Just shoot up straight in the air and then,

Speaker 8:          01:15:49       Ooh,

Speaker 2:          01:15:50       how'd you do that? When they do that and some military aircrafts, correct? Yes. The trick is that you have, you have to transition to level flight and then you the the, the thing that you'd use for vertical Tafe will take over and landing is not suitable for high speed flight,

Speaker 2:          01:16:12       so you have two different systems where thought about this quite a lot. The interesting thing about an electric plane is that you want to go as high as possible, but you need a certain energy density in the battery pack because you have to overcome gravitational potential energy. Once you've overcome gravitational potential energy and you're at at at at a high altitude, the energy use in cruise is very low and then you could recapture a large part of your, the gravitational potential energy on the way down. So you really don't need any kind of reserve fuel, if you will, because you have the, the energy of height, gravitational potential energy. This is a lot of energy. So. So once you can get high the high you like the way to think about a plane, it is. It's a force balance to the force balance. So a plane that is not accelerating, um, is, is a neutral force balance at the force of gravity. If the lift force with the wings, then you've got the force of the one of the thrusting device, so the propeller or turbine or whatever it is, and you've got the resistance force of the air. Now the higher you go, the lower the error assistance. Yes, air density drops exponentially, but drag increases with the square and exponential beats of square. The higher you go, the faster you will go for the same amount of energy

Speaker 2:          01:17:43       and at a certain altitude you can go supersonic with less energy per mile, quite a lot less energy per mile. Then an aircraft at 35,000 feet because it's just a force balance. I'm just doing it for this conversation. It makes sense.

Speaker 4:          01:18:05       No, I'm sure it does. Now, when you think about this new idea of, of, of designing it, when, when, when you have this idea about improving planes, are you going to bring this to somebody or you just chuck a lot on my plate, right? This what I'm saying? I don't know. I don't know how you do what you do now, but if you keep coming up with these, but it's got to be hard to pawn this off on someone else, either a, hey, go do a job. A good job with this vertical takeoff and landing system that I want to implement into regular planes.

Speaker 2:          01:18:41       They're playing electric airplane isn't necessarily right now. Electric cars are important and we need to source energy is important. Stationary storage of energy is important. These things are much more important than creating electric supersonic, fetal. Also, the planes naturally you really want that gravitational energy density for an aircraft. Um, and this is improving over time. So it's important that we accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. That's why electric cars and matters, whether electric cars happen sooner or later, you know, we're, we're really playing the crazy game here with the atmosphere or the oceans were taking vast amounts of carbon from deep ground and putting this, putting this neat and the atmosphere was crazy. We should not do this. It's very dangerous.

Speaker 2:          01:19:41       So we should, we should, we should accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. I mean this, the bizarre thing is that obviously we're going to run out of oil in long term. You know, we're going to. There's only so much oil we can. We can mine it burn. It's total logical. We must have to sustainable energy, transport and energy infrastructure in the longterm so we know that's the end point. We know that. So why I run this crazy experiment where we take trillions of tons of carbon from underground and put it in the atmosphere and oceans. This isn't insane experiment. It's the dumbest experiment in human history. Why are we doing this? It's crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:20:25       Do you think this is a product of momentum that we started off doing this when it was just a few engines, a few hundred million gallons of fuel over the whole world, not that big of a deal and then slowly but surely over a century it got out of control and now it it. It's not just our fuel, but it's also the fossil fuels are involved in so many different electronics, so many different items that people buy. It's just this constant desire for fossil fuels, constant need for oil,

Speaker 2:          01:21:00       without consideration of the sustainability thing is like oil, oil, coal, gas will the easy money. It's easy money. So have you heard about clean coal? The president's been tweeting about. It's got to be real clean coal. All caps. Did you see he used all caps, clean coal. Um, well, you know, it's very difficult to put that CEO to back in the ground. It doesn't like being in solid form. Have you thought about energy like that? Like some sort of a filter, giant building sized filter socks, carbon out of the atmosphere. Is that possible? No. No, he doesn't talk possible. Nope. Nope. No, nope. Definitely not fucked. No, we're not fucked.

Speaker 2:          01:21:48       I mean, this is a quite a complex question, right? You know, we're really just, when the more carbon we take out of the ground and add to the atmosphere and a lot of it gets permeated into the oceans, the more dangerous it is. Like I don't think right now. I think we're okay right now. We can probably even add some more, but the momentum towards sustainable energy is too slow like that. There's a vast base of industry, vast transportation system like this, this two and a half billion cars and trucks in the world, so and, and, and the, the new car and truck production. If it was 100 percent electric, that's only about $100 million per year. So it would take, if you could snap your fingers and instantly turn all old cars and trucks, electric, it would still take 25 years to change the transport based to electric.

Speaker 2:          01:22:52       Makes sense because how long does it truck car truck last before it goes into the junkyard and gets crushed about 20 to 25 years. Is there a way to accelerate that process, like some sort of subsidies or some encouragement from the government financially? Well, the thing that is going on right now is that there is an inherit subsidy in any oil burning device. Any, any power plant or car is fundamentally a consuming the carbon capacity of the oceans and atmosphere or just say atmosphere for short. Um, so like you can say like, okay, there's a certain probability of something bad happening past a certain carbon concentration in the atmosphere, and so there's some uncertain number where if we put too much carbon in the atmosphere, things overheat, a oceans warm up, ice caps melt, ocean real estate becomes a lot less valuable underwater. And, but it's not clear what that number is, but it's definitely a scientists with all.

Speaker 2:          01:24:05       It's really quite the scientists. The scientific consensus is overwhelming. I'm overwhelming. I mean, I don't know any serious scientists, actually zero, literally zero who don't think that, you know, that. But we have quite a serious climate risk that we're facing. And so that's fundamentally a subsidy occurring with every fossil fuel burning thing, power plants per aircraft car. Frankly, even rockets rockets use, uh, you know, they burn, they burn fuel, but there's just, you know, with rockets, there's just no other way to get to orbit unfortunately. So it's the only way. But with cars there's definitely a better way with electric cars and to generate the energy, do so with multiple tax because we've got a giant. Then when you clear reactor in the sky called the sun, it's great sort of shows I've everyday very reliable. So if you can generate energy from solar panels stored with batteries, you can have energy 24 hours a day, um, and then you can, you know, consented to the polls ordinate near to the north, uh, with know high voltage lines. Also, the north, northern, northern parts of the world tend to have a lot of hydropower as well. Um, but anyway, that all fossil fuel power things have an inherent subsidy which is their consumption of the carbon capacity of the atmosphere and oceans.

Speaker 2:          01:25:48       So people tend to think of like, why? Why should electric vehicles have a subsidy? But they're not taking into account. That's all fossil fuel book burning vehicles fundamentally are subsidized by cost,

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       the environmental cost to earth, but nobody's paying for it. We are going to pay for it. Obviously in the future we will pay for it. It's just not paid for now. Now, what is the bottleneck in regards to electric cars and trucks and things like that? Is it battery capacity?

Speaker 3:          01:26:25       Yeah, I've got a scale up production. Got To make the car compelling, make it better than gasoline or diesel cars. Make it more efficient in terms of like the distance it can travel. Yeah. You got to be able to go far, far enough, recharge fast. And you're roadster, you're, you're anticipating 600 miles. Is that correct? Yeah. Yeah, we, what is it, 600 mile right now, like if you driven one 600 miles now? No, we can totally make one right now that will do 600 miles. But the thing is too expensive, so it's like the cars but it's more so. Well just have a 200 kilowatt hour battery pack and you can go 600 miles. What do you have now? Three hundred and 30 mile range, but that's what does that in terms of kilowatts? Well that would be for a model s a 100 kilowatt hour pack.

Speaker 3:          01:27:20       We'll do about 330 miles, maybe 3:35, but some people have hyper mild at to 500 miles. Hyper mild. It would go on 45 miles an hour or something. Yeah, like 30 miles an hour. So it was like on level ground with a pump the tires up really well and go on a smooth surface and then you can go for a long time. But like definitely comfortably do 300 miles easier. This is fine for most people. Usually 200 or 250 miles is fine. Three hundred miles is. You don't even think about it really. Is there any possibility that you could use solar power solar powered one day? Especially in Los Angeles. I mean as you said about that giant nuclear reactor a million times bigger than earth. Just floating in the sky. Is it possible that one day you'll be able to just power all these cars? Just on solar power. I mean we don't ever have cloudy days if we do this, three of them. Well the surface area of a car is

Speaker 3:          01:28:19       without making the car like really blocky or having some. Like a g wagon? Yeah. Like, and, and just like having to look a lot of surface area where like maybe like solar panels fold out or something like your class. That's what we needed. The type. Yeah, that the e a Jaguar e type with a giant long hood. That could be a giant solar panel. What the beginning of the Tesla did want to have this like unfolding solar panel thing. They'd press a button and it will just unfold these solar panels. I'm like, charge, recharge your car in the parking lot. Ah Yeah, we could do that, but I think it's probably better to just put that on your roof. Right. And then it's gonna be facing the sun all the time because otherwise you're to be in shade, you know? It could be in the shade, a community garage or something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:29:03       Yeah. Didn't the fisker have that on the roof? The fisker Karma. New Generation for, I believe it was only for the radio. Is that correct? Yeah, I mean I think it could like reach out like two miles a day or something. Did you laugh when they started blowing up? When they get hit with water? Do you remember what happened? They got the what the, when they had a dealership, fisker Karma is we're parked. Is that like that with a flood in jersey? When the hurricane came in, they got overwhelmed with water and they all started exploding. Is fucking great video of it. Did you watch the video? Watch the video, but I did see a picture of the actual lubed up. Watch that video. Laugh my ass off. They all blow up. They got wet and they blew up. That's not good. Yeah. We made out battery.

Speaker 3:          01:29:53       Waterproof, so that doesn't happen. Smart move. Yeah. There was a guy in Kazakhstan that I think it was Kazakhstan, that he. He just bolted through a tunnel under an underwater tunnel that could flooded tunnel and just turn the wheels to steer and pressed the accelerator and it just floated through the tunnel and he smiled, steered around the other cars and you're like, that's amazing. On the Internet. What happens if your car gets a little sideways? Like if you're driving in snow, like what if you're driving. If you're autopilot is on and you're in Denver and it snows out and your car gets a little sideways, does it correct itself? It's got great traction control, but doesn't know how to like. Correct. Do you know how like, Oh yeah, your ass and kicked out. You know how to counter steer. Oh yeah. No, that's really good.

Speaker 3:          01:30:43       He knows how to do it. Yeah, it's pretty crazy. That's pretty crazy. Yeah, so like if you're going sideways, he knows how to correct itself. It generally won't go sideways. It won't know why not. It will correct itself before it goes sideways. Even in black guys. Yeah. You see this video is we see the car be track alone. Traction control system is very good. It makes you feel like superman. It's great. You feel like you can make you feel like there's incredible driver. I believe it, yeah. Now how do you program what we do our testing on like an lake in Sweden. Oh really? Yeah. Norway and Canada and a few other places. Porsche does a lot of that too as well. They do a lot of their. They do some of their driver training school on these frozen surfaces, so you're just, you. The car is going sideways with you like it or not, and you have to learn how to slide into corners and how do we test it? Will electric cars have really great traction control because the reaction time is so fast. So with a gasoline car, you've got a lot of latency. It takes awhile for the and the engine to react and for you. But for

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       electric motors, incredibly precise. That's why like, like, like if you had like a printer or something, uh, you would only, you wouldn't have a gasoline engine printer. That would be pretty weird. Um, or, or like a surgical device. It's going to be an electric motor on the surgical device, on the printer. Gasoline engines going to be just chugging away. It's not going to have the reaction time, but to an electric motor, it's operating at the second level so it can turn on track, on and off traction within inches of getting on the honors. Like let's say drive a patch of ice. It'll turn traction off and then turn it on a couple of inches right after the ice, like a little patch of ice. Because in the frame of the electric motor, you're moving incredibly slowly. You're like a snake. It's your snail. You're just moving so slowly because it's, it's it, it can see at a thousand frames a second and say one Mississippi.

Speaker 2:          01:33:09       It just thought about if things a thousand times. So it's realized that your wheels are not getting traction. It understand that there's some slippery surface that you driving on. Yes. And it makes adjustments in real time. Yes. And milliseconds. That was, that'd be so much safer than a regular car. Yes. It is just that alone for loved ones. You, you, you'd want them to be driving in your car. Yes. The onboard fuck regular motors that the s x and three art have the lowest probability of injury of any cars ever tested by the US government. Well, this is. Yeah, it's pretty fun. It's pretty crazy. Like wheat, you know, people still sue us, like they'll have like some accident at 60 miles an hour where they'd like twisted an ankle and they slip. They like there'll be dead in another car. They still sue us. But that's to be expected.

Speaker 2:          01:34:05       It is to be expected. Do you take that into account with like the same sort of fatalistic and you know, undertones to sort of just go, uh, you gotta just let it go. This is what people do tell you. I've got to, but it is quite a lot of respect for the justice system. Judges are very smart and they see, they, like I've so far I've found judges to be very good at justice because I like, like what? Like, and juries are good too. Like they're actually quite good, you know, people, you know, you read about like occasional errors and the justice system, let me tell you, most of the time the very good, um, and the other guy mentioned that who fell asleep in the car and you, he wrote over a cyclist and you know, and, and, and that was what

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       encouraged me to get autopilot out as soon as possible. That guy sued us. He sued you for Falling Asleep? Yes. He, he, I, I'm not gonna he blamed it on the new car smell.

Speaker 8:          01:35:09       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:35:10       What? Yes. He blamed him falling asleep on your new car smell. There's someone who's annoying. This is a real thing that happened was there's a lawyer that thought that through in front of his laptop before he wrote that up. Yes. He got a lawyer and he sued us and the judge was like, you're crazy. Stop bothering me. No, thank God. Yes, thank God. Thank God there's a judge out there with a brain until you dredges are judges a very good. Some of them. What about that? Just a lot of boys up up the river in Pennsylvania who was selling those kids out. You know about that story? Judge was selling young boys to presence. He was like literally. Yeah. Literally under bribes for he was. Was this an elected judge or. I'd have a judge that's like actually a politician elected judge. This is a very famous story who he's in jail right now I think for the rest of his life, and he put away. He would take like a young boy would do something like steal something from a store and he would put them in detention for five years, something ridiculous, egregious, and they investigated this history and they found out that he was literally being paid off. Was it by private prisons? Is that what the deal was? There was some sort of a. But anyway, this judges two judges who judges kids for cash scandal is what called the common pleas judges.

Speaker 3:          01:36:38       So I think they are elected. And who was paying them?

Speaker 8:          01:36:40       Oh, um,

Speaker 3:          01:36:43       someone. It was proven to the point where they're in jail now that someone was paying them to put more asses in the seats in these private prisons, million dollar payment to put them in the youth centers builder. A million dollar payment. Yeah. I do think it's this private prisons thing is creating a bad incentive. Dark, right? Yes. But that judge is in prison. Thank God. Yes. But for people who think perhaps the justice system consists entirely of judges like that. I want to assure you this is not the case. The vast majority of judges have very good. I agree. And they care about justice and they could have made a lot more money if they wanted to be a trial lawyer and instead they cared about justice and they made less money because they care about justice. And that's why they're judges. I feel that same way about police officers. I feel like there's so many interactions with so many different people with police officers that the very few that stand out that are horrific, we tend to look at that like this is evidence that police are all corrupt and not. I think that's crazy. No, most, most police are, are, are, are very honest. Um, and uh, and, and, and, and like the military or military personnel

Speaker 2:          01:37:55       that I know of very honorable ethical people and much more honorable ethical than the average person. That's my impression. That's my impression as well. But that's not to suggest that we be complacent and assume everyone's honest and ethical. And obviously if somebody is, is given ape, a trusted place in society such as being a police officer or a judge and they all corrupt, then we must be extra vigilant against such situations and take action. Uh, but, but we should not think that this is somehow broadly descriptive of people in that profession. I couldn't agree more. I think there's also an issue with, um, one of the things that happens with police officers, prosecutors, and, and anyone that's trying to convict someone or arrest someone is that it becomes a game and in games people want to win. Sometimes people cheat. Yes, yes. I mean, if, you know, if your prosecutor shoot, you should not always went to when they are times when you should, like, okay, I just did not want to win this case.

Speaker 2:          01:38:53       Um, and then just pass on that case. Sometimes people want to win too much. That is true. Um, I think also the, they call it becomes tough if you're, if you're like a district Tony, you know, you tend to sort of see a lot of criminals and then your view of the world can get negatively, you know, have a negative, you know, you have a negative view of the world because, you know, you're just interacting with a lot of criminals. But actually most of society is not consistent criminals. Um, and we had this conversation with Dennis several years ago with Tony. I was like, man, I must sometimes seem pretty, pretty dark because, you know, man, there's some, some terrible human beings out there. And he was like, Yep. And he was like dealing with some case which consisted of a couple of old ladies that would run people over somehow for insurance money.

Speaker 2:          01:39:51       It was rough. I was like, wow, that's pretty rough as like, it's like hard to maintain faith in humanity if you're a district attorney, but, but you know, it's only a few percent of society that are actually bad. And then if you go to the worst say point one percent of society or the worst one in a thousand one in a million, you know, like how bad is the millionth worst person in the United States? Pretty damn bad. Like damn evil. Like the, the million, like the millionth of one in a million of evil is so evil. He will, could not even conceive of it. But there's 330 million people in the United States. So that's 330 people out there somewhere. But by the same token, there's also 330 people are incredible angels and unbelievably good human beings. Yeah, on the other side. But because of our fear of danger, we tend to.

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       Our thoughts tend to gravitate towards the worst case scenario and we want to frame that and that is one of the real problems with prejudice. We want, whether it's prejudice towards a different minorities or prejudice towards police officers or anything. So we want to look at the worst case scenario and say this is an example of what this is all about. And you see that even with people, how they frame genders and some some men from women like that, they get ripped off by a few women and they said all women are evil. Some women get fucked over by a few men. All men are shit. And in this this is very toxic and it's also, it's a very unbalanced way of viewing the world and it's very emotionally based and it's based on your own experience, your own anecdotal experience. And it can. It can be very influential to the people around you. And it's just. It's a dangerous way. It's a dangerous thought process and pattern to promote.

Speaker 3:          01:41:47       It is. It is a very dangerous pattern. I really think people should give other people the benefit of the doubt and assume that they're good until proven otherwise, and I think really most people are actually pretty good people. Nobody's perfect. You have to be. If you think of vast numbers of us, they're just interacting with each other, with each other constantly. We have to be better than we think we are. There's no other way right here. All these weapons. But how many times, like nobody's presumably tried to murder you in your industry. Yes. Nobody is like fake flame thrower here. Not a flame thrower. Now we've got a real problem. I'm going to put it on that side too. I'm going to leave it for the guests. Yeah. I'm like, look man, if I say something that fucked up, it's right there. So to liven things up for sure. Guaranteed to make any party better. Yeah. Well that's.

Speaker 1:          01:42:38       I mean that's the armed a civilization theory, right? That an armed community is a safe and polite community

Speaker 3:          01:42:48       in Texas. It's kind of true. Yeah. I mean, people in Texas are super polite and everybody don't make somebody angry. Don't know what's going to happen. Yeah. It's not a good mood. Yeah. Piss people off when everybody can have a gun. Just let that guy get in your lane. Yeah. Yeah. We've got a big, a test site in central Texas near Waco. Beautiful space x, uh, in Mcgregor just about 15 minutes away from Waco. It's close to where Ted nugent lives. It has to Ted nugent. Okay, cool. Yeah, there are, you know, we have lots of fire, loud explosions and things and people like that. They're cool with it. They don't give a fuck out there. They're very supportive. You can buy fireworks where your kids go to school. Yeah. It's, you know, it's dangerous. Yeah. But it's free. It's free. This is something that's very enticing because of that. It is dangerous, but it's also free, right? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       I kinda like Texas. Well, I prefer it over places that are more restrictive but more liberal because you could always be liberal like just because things are free and just because you have a certain amount of, you know, right wing type characters, it doesn't mean you have to be that way, you know, and honestly there's a lot of those people that are pretty fucking open minded and let you do whatever you want to do and you don't bother them. Yeah, exactly. That's my hope right now with the way we're able to communicate with each other today and how radically different it is than generations past is that we all just. The dust settles and we all realized like, like what you were saying, that most people are good. Most people are good. The vast majority. Yes. I think you should give people the benefit of the doubt for sure. I think you're right. Yeah. You know what can help that? What mushrooms do. Anything. They're delicious. Yeah. Right there. Good for you. To all of them, all kinds of. What do you see in terms of when you think about the future of your companies, what do you see as like bottlenecks? He wants more of this. Sure. Thank you. What do you see in terms of like bottlenecks of things that are, that are holding back innovation? Is it regulatory commissions and people that don't understand the technology that are influencing policy? Like what? What? What could potentially be holding you guys back? Right.

Speaker 5:          01:45:23       No.

Speaker 1:          01:45:27       Is there anything that you would change? Yeah, that's a good question.

Speaker 1:          01:45:34       You know, I wish. I wish politicians were better at science. That would help a lot. That's a problem. Yes. There's no incentive for them to be good at science. There isn't. I'm actually, you know, they're, they're pretty good at science in China, I have to say. Yeah. The mayor of Beijing is, I believe in environmental engineering degree and the deputy mayor as a physics degree. I met them and the mayor say, Shanghai has really smart and you're up on technology. What do you think about this government policy of, of stopping use of walway phones and there's something about the, the, the, the worry about spying is, I mean, from what I've understand from real tech people, they think it's horseshit.

Speaker 1:          01:46:23       Oh, I don't know. I don't know. I'm like the government said don't you, by Huawei phones. Is that do, are you up on that are all now, should we just spend in this idea? And I think like I guess if you're, if you're, uh, if you have like top secret stuff, um, then you want to be pretty careful about what hardware you use. Uh, but you know, like most people do not have top secret stuff and like nobody cares what porn you watch, you know, it's like nobody actually cares, you know? So if they do, that's kind of on them. Like national spy agencies do not, do not give a rat's ass watch porn. You Watch, they do not to care. So like what secrets does a national spy agency have to learn from the average citizen? Probably nothing. Well, that's the argument against the, the, the narrative in the argument by a lot of these tech people is that the real concern is that these companies like Huawei are innovating at a radical pace and they're trying to stop them from integrating into our culture and letting this.

Speaker 1:          01:47:31       Right. Right now, they're the number two cell phone manufacturer in the world. Okay. Samsung's number one hallway is number two apples. Now, number three, they surpassed apple is number two. And the idea is that this is all taking place without them having any foothold whatsoever. In America there are no, there's no carriers that have their phones. You have to buy their phones unlocked through some sort of a third party and then put. Okay. So the worry is that these are somehow or another controlled by the Chinese government. The communist Chinese government is going to distribute these phones and I don't know if it's the worries, economic influence that they'll have too much power. I don't know what it is. Are you, are you paying attention on any of this? Not really, no. I don't think we worry too much about Huawei phones. Uh, you know, maybe you know, our national security agencies shouldn't have how?

Speaker 1:          01:48:23       Well, maybe that's a question mark, but I think for the average citizen, doesn't matter just like. No, I'm pretty sure the Chinese government does not care about the goings on of the average American citizen is. Is there a time where you think that there will be no security will be impossible to hold back information that whatever bottleneck will, will let go. We're gonna, we're gonna give in that whatever bottleneck between privacy and ultimate innovation will, will have to be bridged in order for us to achieve the next level of technological proficiency. That we're just going to abandon it and there'll be no, no security, no privacy. Do people want privacy because they seem to put everything on the Internet? Well, right now they're confused, but when you're talking about your neuro link and this, this idea that one day we're going to be able to share information and we're going to be some sort of a thing that symbiotically create a symbiotic and connected. I think we really need to worry about security and that situation and one. Sure. That's like a security repair amount. Sure, but also we will, we will be is will be so much different. Lark, our concerns about money, about status, about where all these things will will seemingly go by the wayside if we really become enlightened, if we really become artificially enlightened by some sort of an ai interface where we have this symbiotic relationship with some new Internet type connection to inflammation.

Speaker 1:          01:50:01       What? What happens then?

Speaker 9:          01:50:04       What?

Speaker 1:          01:50:06       What is important? What is not important? Is Privacy important when we're all gods?

Speaker 3:          01:50:13       I mean I think the things that we think are important, key private right now we probably will not think are important. Right. Information, right? What do you, what do you hide? Emotions. What do we hide? I mean, I think like, I don't know, maybe it's like embarrassing, so embarrassing stuff,

Speaker 9:          01:50:35       but

Speaker 3:          01:50:36       there's actually like I think people, there's not that much that's kept private. The people that is actually relevant, right? That's people what other people would actually care about and we think other people care about it, but they don't really care about her sense. Certainly governments don't.

Speaker 9:          01:50:50       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:50:51       well some people care about it, but then it gets weird when you, when it gets exposed, like Jennifer Lawrence when I was naked, pictures of her God exposed like I think in some ways people liked her more than they realize like, oh, she's just a person that just a girl who likes sacs and it's just alive and has a boyfriend and send them messages and now you get to look into it and you probably shouldn't have somebody let it go and they put it online and the all right.

Speaker 3:          01:51:16       She seems to be done. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:51:18       Person. She's just you and me and the same thing. She just send some weird place where she's on a 35 foot tall screen with music playing every time she talks.

Speaker 3:          01:51:30       Yeah, I, I, I'm sure she's, she's not, uh, not happy about it but she, she's. But she's clearly doing fine.

Speaker 1:          01:51:38       But once this interface is fully realized where we really do become something far more powerful in terms of our cognitive ability, our ability to understand irrational thoughts and mitigate them and that we're all connected and some sort of an insane way. What I mean, how, what, uh, what are thoughts on wealth, our thoughts on social status, like how many of those just evaporate and our need for privacy. Maybe our need for privacy will be the ultimate bottleneck that we'll have to subsidize that we'll have to surpass.

Speaker 9:          01:52:13       I think

Speaker 3:          01:52:15       the things that we think are important. No will probably not to be important in the future, but there will be things that are important for things. I don't know. They might be some war of ideas potentially. I don't think Darwin's going away.

Speaker 9:          01:52:32       Right?

Speaker 3:          01:52:33       No one's going to be there. That was on will be there forever. Forever. Yeah. It would just be a difference in a different arena. Different. The

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       digital arena, different arena. Dawn is not going away. What keeps you up at night?

Speaker 2:          01:52:57       Well, it's quite hard to run companies. Yeah. Especially car companies. How did they. It's quite challenging. The car businesses, the hardest one of all the things you do. Yes, because it's a consumer oriented business as opposed to like space x and not that space x space X. There's no walk in the park but, but a car company, it's very difficult to keep a company alive. It's very difficult. You know, there's only two car companies and the history of American car companies that haven't gone bankrupt. And that's Ford and Tesla. That's it. Yeah. Ford wrote out that crazy storm. Huh? They're the only ones. The skin of their teeth shout out to the Mustang.

Speaker 2:          01:53:41       Yeah. By the skin of their teeth. That is interesting. Right? Same with Tesla. We barely survived. How close did you get to folding? Very close. We a 2008 is not a good time to be a car company, especially a startup company and especially in electric car company. I was like stupidity squared and this is when you had those cool roadsters with the t top with the. I'm a target top. Yeah. We had like a, he was a highly modified elise chassis. The body was all completely different, but that was super dumb strategy that we actually did was dumb. It was based on false premises. One false premise was that we'd be able to, uh, cheaply convert the Lotus Elise and use that as a core platform and that we will be able to use technology from this little company called ace propulsion for the electric drive train. And the battery problem is they propulsion technology to not work in production and we ended up using none of it in long term.

Speaker 2:          01:54:49       None of it. We have to redesign everything. And then the, once you add a battery pack and electric motor to the cart, got a heavier cut, 30 percent heavier, invalidated the entire structure, all the crash structure, everything had to be redone, nothing like that. I think it had less than seven percent of the parts were common with any other device including cars or anything else? The seven percent yes. Everything including tires and wheels, bolts breaks even every year. And we'll see the steering wheel was. I think the steering wheel was almost the same. Yes. The windscreen went Wednesday. No, I think the windscreen is the same. Yes, I think. I think we were able to keep the last seven percent. So that's basically every body panel was different. The entire structure was different. The way we couldn't use the H, like the

Speaker 3:          01:55:43       HVAC system, the view of the air conditioner was belt driven, air conditioner off. So now we needed a something that was electrically driven which needed a new AC compressor and all that takes away from the battery life as well. Right? Yeah. We needed an small, highly efficient air conditioning system that fit in a tiny car and was electrically powered belt driven. It's very difficult. How much do those weigh those cars? The roadster, I think it was about 2,700 pounds. That's still very depending on which version? Twenty six, 52, 27, 50 pounds, something like that. And what was the weight distribution?

Speaker 3:          01:56:23       It was about 50. Well they were different versions of the car. So it's about 55 on the rear because we're bias. Right. But not bad considering like a nine slash 11, which is like one of the most popular sports cards of all time heavy. We're in bias. Well, I mean yeah, the nine slash 11. Like the joke is like the bench dirt, despite Newton not being on their side. If you have fighting Newton, it's very difficult. Well, it's like if you've got this, the moments of inertia on nine slash 11 don't make any sense. They do. Once you understand them, once you understood, don't want to hang the engine off the ass. This is not a wise move. You don't want to let up on the gas. When you're in a corner, you, the problem with, uh, with, with, uh, with, with something, that's where the engine is mounted over the rear axle or off the rear axle, towards the rear is that you pull them moment of inertia is fundamentally screwed.

Speaker 3:          01:57:19       You cannot solve this. It's unsolvable. You're screwed. Pull them over to know Sherry. You're screwed, right? Like, seriously. If you spun the car like a top, that that's your polar moment of inertia. You're just, I promised, I wouldn't swear to this show by the way, really to who it was a friend. Tell that friend to go fuck himself. Who told you not to swear. Read a good friend. You realize you're fucking Elan Musk can do whatever you want, man. If you ever get confused, call me elsewhere and private. Swear up a storm. Just say fricking fun way. There's like old house moms that have children. That's fricking thing. Yeah. But anyway, like the Porsche, it's kind of incredible how well Porsche handles given that it's the physics, the moments of inertia. So messed up, uh, to actually still make it work well is, is incredible. Well, if you know how to turn into the corner and once you get used to the feeling of it, there's actual benefits to it.

Speaker 3:          01:58:26       You know, there, there are some benefits. I enjoy the car I had before. Tesla was a nine slash seven. Oh, nine, nine, seven or six or seven. Yeah. Yeah. I'm great car man. Yeah. I mean particularly with other Porsche stutter when they had the variable veins a turbo and yet don't have the turbo lag. That was great. Yeah, that was really great. The turbo lag was like, you know, your floor it, like photo home, call your mom the older one, but an hour later the car accelerates. Super dangerous too because in the real world starts spinning. Yeah. Yeah. There's something fun about it though, like feeling that rear weight kicking around, you know, and again I could feel to it. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. But that's what I was talking about earlier about that

Speaker 1:          01:59:14       card that I have 93, nine slash 11. It's just there's not fast. It's not, it's not the best handling car but it's more satisfying than any other car I have because it's so mechanical. It's like everything about it like crack holes and bumps and it gives you all this feedback and I take it to the comedy store because when I get there I feel like my brain is just pop in and it's on fire. It's like a strategy for me now that I really stopped driving other cars there. I drive that car there just for the brain juice. Just for the owner. The interaction.

Speaker 3:          01:59:50       I mean you should try model s p 100 d will blow your mind your skull. Okay. Yeah. Tell me what to order. I'll order one LSP, 100 d. okay. Jamie, that's the Tesla car that I drive. Okay. Okay, I'll get with the car you drive. Okay. It will blow your mind out of your spirit. I believe you. How can I drive 300 miles? That's good for la. Regular days. You'll never notice the battery. Never, never. How hard is it to get like one of them crazy plugs installed in your house? That difficult? Now it's super easy. It's like, yeah, it's like a dryer plug. It's like a dryer outlet. Didn't you come up with some crazy tiles for your roof that are solar paneled? Yeah, yeah, we're have it on my roof right now. Actually, I'm just trying it out. But it's like, it's the thing is it takes while to like test roof stuff because roofs have to last a long time.

Speaker 3:          02:00:39       So like your watch your roof to last like 30 years for a regular groove now. So there's two versions. There's like the solar panels you put on a roof. So like depends on whether your roofs new or old. So if you're roof new you don't want to replace the roof, you want to put solar panels on the roof. Um, so that's like retrofit, you know, and they were trying to make the retrofit Pendleton Grill Nice. Um, and then, but then the new product we're coming out with is if you, if you have a roof that's either you're building a house or you're going to replace your roof anyway, then you make the site, the tiles have solar, solar cells embedded in the tiles and then it's quite a tricky thing because you want to not see the solar cell behind the glass tile. Uh, so you have to really work with the glass and, and, and the, and the various coatings and layers so that you don't see the solar cell behind the glass, otherwise it doesn't look right.

Speaker 3:          02:01:34       Right. So it's really tricky. There's this shame and put it up there. Yeah, that looks good. See, like if you look closely, you can see if you're zooming in, right? You can see the, you can see the cell, but if you zoom out you don't see the sale. Right. Well it looks cool though. That's hard. It's really hard because you have to have sunlight go through. Right. But when it gets reflected back out, it doesn't, it, it hides the fact that there's a sale there. Now. Are those available to the consumer right now? Well, we have a, I think those on that roof right there. Yes. That's amazing. Oh, that looks good. Yeah. Ooh, I liked that one too. Smart. Oh, so you get that kind of fake Spanish looking thing. I like French late. That's why people in Connecticut smoking pipes will get that one. Yeah. That's bad ass dude. So those will actually work, I believe you. So the, the, the, the solar panels that are on that house that we just looked at, is that sufficient to power the entire home?

Speaker 3:          02:02:40       It depends on your energy on how. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, generally yes. I would say it's probably for most it's going to vary, but anywhere from more than you need to maybe half, like half to one point. Five of the energy that you need depending on how much roof you have relative to living space and how ridiculous you are with the TV. TV is no problem. Air Conditioning, air conditioning, air conditioning is the problem. If you have an efficient air conditioner and you don't, and depending on how like are you at conditioning rooms when they don't need to be air conditioned, which is very common because it's a pain in the neck and it was like programming or BCR. It's like right now it's just blinking 12. I'll tell people just like to hell with that. I'm just gonna make it this temperature all day long. Don't have a smart home where if you're in the room then it stays cool. Right? Yeah. It should predict when you're going to be home and then cool. The room, the rooms that you're likely to use with a little bit of intelligence. We're not talking about like genius home here. We're just talking like elementary basic stuff.

Speaker 3:          02:03:54       You know, like if you could hook that into the car, like knows you're coming home. Like there's no point in calling the home, keeping the, keeping the home really cool when you're not there, but I can tell that you're coming home. What's going to cool it to the right temperature, right. We have an editor that works with your solar panels or anything like that. Yeah, yeah, we do and we need to hook it into the air conditioning to. I really make the air conditioning work. Have you thought about creating an air conditioning system? I know you have a trick question. I cannot answer questions about ritual potential. Let's just let it go. We'll move on to the next thing, but that would be an interesting idea. Yeah, I would say radiant heating, all that

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       good ideas. Now when you, when you think about the efficiency of these homes and you think about implementing solar power and battery power and is there anything else that people are missing? Is there any other. Like I just saw a smartwatch that is powered by the heat of the human body. Some new technology is able to fully power that way. I don't know if it's fully or if it's like this watch right here. This is a casio, it's called a pro tech and it's in like an outdoors watch and solar powered and so it has the ability to operate for a certain amount of time on solar. So if you have it exposed, it could function for a certain amount of time on solar. Yeah. Well, you know, I'm like, there's this health lighting watches where it's just got to wait in the watch and as you move your wrist, the weight moves from one side to the other and it winds the watch up.

Speaker 1:          02:05:31       That's a pretty cool thing. Yeah. Yeah. It's amazing that Rolex is that it's all done mechanically. There's no batteries in there and it's no nothing. Yeah, you could do the same thing. Create a little charger that's based on a risk movement. It really depends on how much energy or what she uses. You know, what's fucked up about that though. We accept a certain amount of like fuckery with those watches. Like I brought my watch, I have a rolex that uh, my friend Lorenzo gave me and I brought it to the watch store and I said, this thing's always fast. I said, it's always like after a couple months it's like five minutes fast and they go, Yep, bigly. Yeah. It's just what it does. Okay, well hold on. I go. So you telling me that it just is always going to be fast. They just like, yeah. It's just like every few months you gotta reset. It seems like they should recalibrate that thing. They can't. They tried. They see every few months with it's four months or five months or six months. It's going to be a couple minutes fast. Okay. It seems like they should really recalibrate that because if it's always fast you can just delete those minutes. You need to fucking kicked down the door at Rolex and go, you bitches are lazy.

Speaker 1:          02:06:39       It's kind of amazing that you can keep time mechanically on a wristwatch with these tiny little gears. It's amazing. Yeah, I mean the whole luxury watch market is fascinating. I, I'm, I'm, I'm not that involved in, in terms of like I don't buy them. I bought them as gifts so I don't buy them for myself, but when I look at them online, if there's million dollar watches out there now that are like, they have like little rotating moons and stars and they live like, look at this thing. How much does that one, Jamie [inaudible] preposterous. I like gears. I just love them and it looked beautiful, but there's some of these people that are just taking it right in the ass. They buying these watches for like $750,000. I'm like, Yo, that's a timex son. Nobody knows. It's not any better than some cassio that you could just buy online.

Speaker 1:          02:07:27       Like, look at that though. Well, here's the thing. If you're a person that doesn't, just want to know the time you want craftsmanship, you want some artisans touch. You want innovation in terms of like a person figuring out how gears and cogs all line up perfectly to every time it turns over, it's basically a second. I mean that's just. There's art to that. It's not just telling time, hey, I like this watch a lot, but if it got hit by a rock, I wouldn't be sad. It's just a watch. It's a mass produced thing that runs on some courts battery, but those things that's. There's art to that. No, I agree. It's beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. Love it. Yeah. There's something. There's something amazing about it. It's a. because it represents the human creativity. It's not just. It's not just a electronic innovation. There's something. There's a person's work in that. Yes, but you don't have a watch on. No, ever. I used to have a watch. What happened? My phone tells the time point, but if you lose your phone, do you wait? Hold on, let me guess. You are a no case guy. That's correct.

Speaker 1:          02:08:50       On the edge. Grasse Tyson, neela grass titus who was in here last week. I'm marveled at his ability to get through life without a case. That's right. You know, he takes his phone and he flips it in between his fingers like, like a, like a. A soldier would do it. His rifle or his roles that shed in between his fingers. Okay. Marvelous. Wow. He says that's the reason why they do it. He said, when you look at someone who has a rifle, why would they do that? Why would they flip it around like that? Right. So that when it goes to drop, they have it in their hand, they catch it quickly. So that's what he does with his phone. He's just flipping his phone around all the time. I got that in Mexico. I was hoping it holds joint, doesn't do anything. It seems to open it just as a host, a whole storage store, things in there, but like try to put a joint in there and close it. You put like one, one blunt one, but it seems pretentious, you know, that's the idea behind it. I bought it when I was in Mexico because I figured it'd be a good size to hold joints or

Speaker 1:          02:10:03       so. Is that a joint or is it a cigar? You know, it's um, marijuana inside of a tobacco. Oh, okay. So it's like plot plot tobacco never had that. Yeah, I think I tried one once. Come on, man, probably can't because stockholders, right? I mean, it's legal, right? It's totally legal. Okay. How does it work? Do People get upset at you if you do certain things? A backhoe and marijuana in there, that's all

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       it is.

Speaker 1:          02:10:38       Did the combination of tobacco and marijuana is wonderful? First turned onto it by Charlie Murphy and then reignited by Dave Chappelle

Speaker 3:          02:10:47       plus whiskey. Exactly. Perfect. Balances it out. Alcohol is a drug that's been grandfathered in. Well, it's not just.

Speaker 1:          02:10:57       It's a drug that gets a bad rap because you could just have a little. It's great. Fine. Yeah. A little sip here and there and just your inhibitions are relaxed and it shows your true self and hopefully you're more joyous and friendly and happy and everything's good. The real worry is that people that can't handle it, like the real worried about people who can handle cars that can go zero to 60 in one point nine seconds or anything. Have you ever considered something that like imagine if one day everyone has a car that's on the same, at least technological standard is one of your cars and everyone agrees that the smart thing to do is not just to have bumpers, but to perhaps have some sort of a magnetic repellent device, something, some electro magnetic field around the cars. As cars come close to each other, they automatically radically decelerate because of magnets or something.

Speaker 3:          02:11:56       Well, I mean our cars brake automatically break. Yeah. Yeah. When they see things, yes, but look a physical barrier like a. well, the wheels work pretty well. We'll know pretty well decelerated at one point, one to one point two g's, that kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          02:12:15       Is there a concern that one day all your cars will be on the road and there they'll still be regular people with regular cars 20, 30 years from now that'll get in the mix and be the the main problem?

Speaker 3:          02:12:31       Yeah. I think it was sort of like know it was a time of transition where there were horses and gasoline cars in the road at the same time. It's been pretty weird. Oh, that would be the weirdest. Yeah. Horses were tricky. You don't want to be back in a Manhattan had like 300,000 horses. You figure like horse lives. Fifteen years. Got 20,000 horses that Robin Dad every day or every year I should say every year. 20,000 horses. If this 300,000 horses in 15 year lifespan back in the gangs in New York days. That movie. Yeah. It's a lot of dead horses now. You need a dead horse to move the horse. Right? The probably get pretty freaked out if they have to a dead horse because they know what's going on. Yeah, I mean it's pretty weird. No, I would imagine dragon this dead horse around and I'm a horse. Do you ever stop, stop

Speaker 1:          02:13:28       and think about your role in. Do you ever stop and think about your role in the culture? Because me as a person who never met you until today, when I think of you, you know, I've always thought of you as being this weirdo super inventor dude who just somehow or another keeps coming up with new shit, but there's not a lot of you out there like everybody else seems to be. I mean obviously you make a lot of money and there's a lot of people that make a lot of money. Like that clock. Yeah. Pretty Dope. Right? This is a great clock. Yeah. You want one? I'll get you one. Sure. Okay. Done. I like weird things like this. Oh, this is the coolest. Is tgt promotion. What is his tgt studios? Tgt Studios. Yeah. To a gentleman who makes all this by hand. Yeah. It's really cool. With study is filled with where devices. Well, get ready for another one. All right. I'm sending it your way. Well, you want to Werewolf to hook you up. All right. I'll take one. One a werewolf and 1:00 coming up.

Speaker 1:          02:14:30       Do you think about your role in the culture? Because me as a person, they ever met you until today. I've always looked at you and like, wow, like how's this guy just keep inventing shit. Like how do you, how do you keep coming up with all these new devices and what do you ever consider how anew? Like I had a dream once that there was a million tesla's instead of like one tesla, there was a million. Tesla's not Chesley the car, but Nicola. Oh yeah, sure. And that in his day there was a million people like him who were radically innovative. It was a weird dream, man. It was so strange and I've had it more once the results in a very rapid technology innovation, that's for sure. It's one of the only dreams in my life. I've had more than one time. Okay. Like where I've woken up and it's in the same dream, I'm in the same dream and in this dream it's 19 forties, 19 fifties, but everyone is severely advanced.

Speaker 1:          02:15:27       There's flying blimps with lcd screens on the side of them and everything is bizarre and strange and it stuck with me for whatever it. Obviously this is just a stupid dream, but for whatever reason, all these years that stuck with me like it takes one man, like Nikola Tesla to have more than a hundred inventions that were patents. Right? I mean he had some pretty great, pretty fucking amazing ideas. Yes. But there was in his day there was very few people like him because it's true. What if there was a million, like what exists advance very quickly. Right. But there's not a million. Elon Musk's is one motherfucker. Do you have think about that? We just try to not. Hm. I don't think. I don't think you'd necessarily want to be me. I. Well,

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       what's the worst part about it? If people would like it that much, well most people wouldn't, but they can't be you. So that's like, that's like some superhero type Shit, you know? He wouldn't want to be spiderman rather this sleep tight and Gotham city. I hope he's out there doing his job. It's very hard to turn it off. Yeah. What's the hardest part? Might sound great to me, but what if it doesn't turn off? Now I showed you the isolation tank and you've never experienced that before. I think that could help you turn it off a little bit just for the night. Yeah, just give you a little bit of sleep. A little bit of perspective is magnesium that you get from the water as well. That makes you, makes you sleep easier because the water has epsom salts in it, but maybe some sort of strategy for sacrificing your, a biologic or not sacrificing but enhancing your biological recovery time by figuring out a way, whether it's through meditation or some other ways to shut off that. That thing at night. Like you must have like a constant stream of ideas. It's running through your head all the time.

Speaker 3:          02:17:42       Getting text messages from checks. No. Uh, I, I'm getting text messages from friends saying, what the hell are you doing? Smoking weed? Is that bad for you? It's legal. It's got to be an approved. It's not, you know, uh, I'm not a regular smoker of weed. How often you smoke it? Almost never.

Speaker 5:          02:18:05       Mm.

Speaker 3:          02:18:08       I mean it's, it's, I don't actually notice any effect. Well, there you go. There was a time where, I think it was ram das or someone gave some Buddhist monk bunch acid. Okay. And he ate it and it had no effect on them. I doubt that I would say that too, but I've never meditated to the level that some of these people that were there constantly meditating all day, they don't have any material possessions and all of their energy is spent trying to achieve a certain mindset. I would like to cynically deny that. I'd like to cynically say contagious fucking think the same way I do. They just hang out with flip flops on and make weird noises, but maybe now you know, I, I know a lot of people like reed and that's fine, but I don't find that it is very good to full productivity for you, but for me, yeah, it's definitely. I would imagine that for someone like you, it's not someone like you, it, it'd be more like a cup coffee. Right? You want your latte? Yeah. That's more like the opposite of a cup of coffee, a cup of coffee and reverse. Oh, weed is. No. I'm saying you would like more, more like, will it be beneficial to you? It'd be like coffee. I like to get things done. I like to be useful. Um,

Speaker 1:          02:19:29       that is one of the hardest things to do is to be useful. When you say you like to get things done in terms of like what you get to satisfaction when you complete a project, when something, something that you invent comes to fruition and you see people enjoying it. That feeling yes. Doing something useful for other people that I liked doing. That's interesting for other people. Yes. So that. Do you think that that is maybe the way you recognize that you have this unusual position in the culture where you can uniquely influence certain things because of this? I mean you essentially have a gift, right? I mean you would think it was a curse, but I'm sure it's been fueled by many, many years of discipline and, and learning, but you essentially have a gift and that you have this

Speaker 1:          02:20:25       radical sort of creativity engine when it comes to innovation and technology. It's like you're just, you're going at a very high rpm all the time. What does that last and stuff? I don't know what would've happened if I got into a sensory deprivation tank. Let's try. It sounds concerning like running the engine with no resistance. That. Is that what it is though? Maybe it's not. Maybe it's fine. I don't know how I'll try it. I'll try it. Have you ever experimented with meditation or anything? Yes. What do you do or what have you done rather? I mean you just sort of sit there and required and then repeat some mantra which acts as a focal point. It's still the mind. It just stolen mind, but I don't find myself drawn to it frequently. Do you think that perhaps productivity is maybe more attractive to you then enlightenment and or even the concept of whatever enlightenment means. Like what are you trying to achieve when you're meditating all the time? What would you. It seems like almost like there's a frantic ness to your creativity that comes out of this, this burning furnace, and in order for you to like calm that thing down, he got thrown. Might have to throw it too much water on it.

Speaker 1:          02:21:59       It's like a never ending explosion. Like what is it like I try and explain it to a dumb person like me. What's going on at her and never under any explosion. It's just constant ideas. Just bouncing around. Yes. Ooh Damn. Yeah, so when everybody leaves, just Elan sitting at home, brushing his teeth. Just of ideas bouncing around your head the whole time. When did you realize that that's not the case with most people? I think when I was, I don't know, five or six or something, I thought I was insane. Why do you think you're insane? Because it was clear that other people did not. What? Their mind wasn't exploding with ideas all the time. They were an expressing it. They weren't talking about it all day and you realize by the time you were five or six, like, oh, they're probably not even getting this thing that I'm getting. No, it was just strange. It was like,

Speaker 5:          02:23:08       hmm, that's strange.

Speaker 1:          02:23:11       That was my conclusion. I asked range, but did you feel diminished by it in any way? Like knowing that this is a weird thing that you really probably couldn't commiserate with with other people, they wouldn't understand that you hope they wouldn't find out because they might put me away with something. You thought that for a second. Yes. When you were little and the other people are wearing. Or what if they put money away? Like when you were little, you thought this, wow. Like you thought this is so radically different than the people that are around me. If they find out I got the stream coming in. Yeah. Wow. But, you know, I was only like five or six really. Like, do you think this is like. I mean there's, there's outliers biologically. You mean there's people that are seven foot nine. There's people that have giant hands is people that have eyes that are 20 slash 15 vision. There's always outliers.

Speaker 5:          02:24:08       Um,

Speaker 1:          02:24:10       do you feel like you're caught this? Like you have got some, you're like on some weird innovation, creativity sort of wave. That's very unusual. Like you tapped into. I mean, just think of the, the, the various things you've been able to accomplish in a very short amount of time and you're constantly doing this. That's a weird. You're weird person, right? I agree. Yeah. Like what if there's a million Elon Musk's? Well that would be very weird. Woo. Yeah, that'd be pretty weird. Like, are real weird. Definitely. Yeah. What if they're a million show rockets? The probably is probably too many and I mean, I think that's the case with a lot of folks. Yeah. I mean, but like, uh, you know, my goal is like try to useful things, try to maximize it. Probably the is good. Um, make the future exciting when you look forward to,

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       you know, know with, uh, you know, with Tesla or like try and make things that people love you. I was like, not like kit. How are you? How many things can you buy that you really love, that really give you joy? So rare, so rare. I wish there were more things. That's what we're trying to make things that somebody loves.

Speaker 1:          02:25:48       When you, when you think about making someone loves, like, do you specifically think about like what things would improve people's experience? Like what, what would change the way people interface with life that would make them more relaxed or more happy? You really think like when you thinking about things like that, is that one of your considerations? Like what? What can I do that would help people that maybe they wouldn't be able to figure it out?

Speaker 2:          02:26:18       Yeah. Like how, like what are the set of things that can be done to make the future better? Like you know, like, so I think the future where we are a space fairing civilization and out there among the stars. This is very exciting. This makes me look forward to a future. This makes me want that future. You know, the things that need to be, things that make you look forward to waking up in the morning, you wake up in the morning, you look forward to the day before to the future and a future where we are spacefaring civilization and out there among the stars. I think that's very exciting. That is a thing we want. Whereas if, if you knew we would not be a space frank civilization, but forever confined to Earth, this would not be a good future. That would be very sad. I think

Speaker 1:          02:27:09       it would be the future of the, the just the finite lifespan, the earth itself and the solar system itself that even though it's possibly, you know what I mean? How many, how long do they feel like the sun and the solar system is going to exist? How many hundreds of millions of years.

Speaker 2:          02:27:27       Well, it's probably, if you're saying the windows, the sun boil the ocean, right?

Speaker 1:          02:27:35       For about 500 million years. So is, is it sad that we never leave because in 500 million years that happens? Is that what you're saying?

Speaker 2:          02:27:45       No, I just think like if there are two futures and one futurists, we're out there among the stars and the things we read about and see in science fiction movies, the good ones are true and we have these starships and we're, we're, we're going to see what other planets are like and where a multitenant species and the scope and scale of consciousness is expanded across many civilizations. And many planets and many star systems. This is a great future. This is a wonderful thing to me and that's what we should strive for.

Speaker 1:          02:28:25       But that's biological travel. That's cells traveling physically to another location. Yes.

Speaker 1:          02:28:34       Do you think that's definitely where we're going? No. Yeah, I don't think so either. I used to think so and now I'm thinking more likely less than ever. Like almost every day. Less likely. We can definitely go to the moon and Mars. Yeah. Everything will go to the asteroid belt and we can go to the moons of Jupiter. Saturn. You can even get to Pluto. That'd be the craziest place ever. If we colonize Mars and retire, formed it and turned it into like a big Jamaica. Just imagine they're going to be great. It's. There's amazing, right? We turned the whole thing into Cancun. Well, I mean over time it wouldn't be easy, but yes. If you could just want. You could warm it up. Yeah, you can look it up. You could add air. You get some water there. I mean over time, hundreds of millions of years or whatever it takes.

Speaker 1:          02:29:26       We're going to be a multiplanetary vcs. That would be amazing species. That's to be like air conditioning. Sad. I'm pro human. Me Too. Yeah, me too. I love humanity. I think it's great. We're glad as a robot that you love humans because we love you too. And we don't want you to kill us and eat us. And uh, I mean strangely, I think a lot of people don't like humanity and see it as a blight, but I do not. But I think one of those, I think part of that it's just they've been, you know, they've been struggling. When people struggle, they associate their struggle with other people. They never internalize their problems. They looked to other people is holding them back and people suck and fuck people and it's just, you know, it's a neverland. Never ending cycle, but not always. Again, most people are really good. Most people, the vast majority. This may sound Corny, it does sound Corny, but love is the answer is the answer. Yep. Yeah, it is. It sounds quite because we're all scared, you know, we're all scared of trying to love people being rejected or someone take advantage of you because you're trying to be loving. Sure. But if we all could just relax and love each other,

Speaker 1:          02:30:46       wouldn't hurt to have more love in the world. It definitely wouldn't hurt. Yeah, it'd be great. Yeah, we should do that. Yeah. I agreement really. How do you fix that? You have a love machine, you know, but to probably spend more time with your friends and less time on social media now deleting social media from your applications, from your phones and other that give you a 10 percent boost to happiness was the percentages.

Speaker 3:          02:31:18       I think probably something like that. Yeah. It's about a good 10 percent. Yeah. I mean, I mean, the only thing I've kept as twitter because I kind of like need some means of getting a message out, you know? Right. Um, well that's about it. So far so good. Well, what's interesting with you, you, he actually occasionally engage with people on twitter. Yeah. It's what percentage of that is a good idea? Ha. Good to question 10 percent.

Speaker 3:          02:32:00       It's mostly, I think it's unbalanced. More good than bad, but there's definitely some bad. So do you ever. Hopefully the good outweighs the bad. Do you ever think about how odd it is, that weird feeling that you get when someone says something Shitty to you on twitter and you read it, that weird feeling, this weird little negative Joel. It's like a subjective negative jolt of energy they don't really need to absorb, but you do anyway. Like, well fuck the score for Kim. I mean there's a lot of negativity on twitter. It is, but it's a weird. It's in its form like the way if you ingest it as if you're like you try to be like a little scientist as you're ingesting it, you're like, wow, where does this? And I'm even getting upset at some strange person saying something mean to me it's not even accurate.

Speaker 3:          02:32:51       I mean the vast number of negative comments, a syllabus for the vast majority who I just ignore them. The vast majority. Yeah. Every now and again, get drawn in somewhat good. It's not good. Make mistakes. Yes, you could make mistakes. We make some mistakes. We're all human. We can make mistakes. Yeah, it's hard and people love it. When you say something and you'd take it back and they're like, fuck you. We saved it forever. Fucking screenshot that shit bitch. You had that thought you had that thought like, well, I deleted it. Not good enough. Who had the thought? I'm better than you. I never had that thought you had that thought. You piece of shit. Look, I saved it. I put it on my blog. Yeah, sure why people think that that anyone would think that deleting a tweet that makes them go away. It was like, hello.

Speaker 3:          02:33:43       Then the Internet for awhile. Yeah, but it's even like anything is they don't forever you to be able to delete it because the problem is if you don't delete it and you don't believe it anymore, it's really hard to say, hey, that thing above, I don't really believe that anymore. I changed the way I view things. Yes, because people go, well, fuck you already have that over there. I'm going to just take that. I'm not going to pay attention to that shit. You wrote her. It's on your permanent record forever. Tattoo on your permanent record. Yeah. It's like a tattoo. You keep it. Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, it's, it's this thing where there's, it's, it's

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       a, there's a lack of compassion, so lack of compassion issue. People just like intentionally shitty to each other all the time online and trying to catch me. It's more trying to catch people doing something that's arrestable like a cop trying to like get, you know, arrests on as his record. It's like they're trying to catch you with something more than. They're logically looking at it thinking it's a bad thing that you've done or the idea they don't agree with so much. They need to insult you.

Speaker 2:          02:34:46       Trying to catch you. Yeah, I mean it's way easier to be mean on social media than it is to be mean in person. Yes. Way Easier. Yeah. Yeah. It's weird.

Speaker 1:          02:34:58       It's, it's not a normal way of humans interacting. It's cheating. You're not supposed to be able to interact so easily, but people were not looking at. Yes. You would never do that. You'd never be so mean to somebody looking in their eyes and if you did, you'd feel like shit. Most people. Yeah. Unless you're a sociopath, you'd feel terrible. Yes. Elon Musk. This has been a pleasure. Yeah, likewise. Really has been. It's been an honor. Thank you for having me. Thanks for doing this because, uh, I know you don't do a lot of a long form stuff like this. I hope I didn't weird you out and hope you don't get mad that you smoke weed. It's legal. We're in California. This is justice legal. This whiskey we've been drinking. Exactly. This is all good. Right? Jaris. Thank you. Is there any message you would like to put out other than love's the answer because I think you really nailed it with that.

Speaker 2:          02:35:53       No, I think, you know, I think people should be nicer to each other and give people and give, give more credit to, to others and don't assume that they're mean until you know they're actually mean, you know, just, it's easy to demonize people, usually wrong about it. People a nicer than you think.

Speaker 1:          02:36:19       Get people more credit. I couldn't agree more. And, uh, I want to thank you not just for all the crazy innovations you've come up with and your constant flow of ideas, but that you choose to spread that idea, which is, it's a, it's a very vulnerable, but it's very honest and I, it resonated with me and I believe it. I believe it's true too. So thank you. Oh, you assholes out there. Be Nice. Be Nice, bitch. All right. Thank you everybody. Thanks. All right, ready?
