Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey everybody, this is a very special podcast, very special Saturday afternoon podcasts. We'll watch an old fight from 1954. That's supposed to be a pro wrestling match with Gary Tonin, one of the best Jujitsu artists in America today, one of the hot young fucking killers of grappling. And of course my brother Eddie Bravo. Yo Yo Holler. And we're watching this video that we found. All of us found this on the underground. Someone posted it. I'll have to give the dude props. I forget his name, but it's a Kamora the guy who the shoulder lock, the Camorra was named after because you use it on Leo Gracie back in. What was that like the forties or something like that man from adult? No, well this is only 1962. I would would know it was a long ass time with black and white point point being, um, he, he was uh, he did some pro wrestling and he did a pro wrestling match with this guy.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       I think I'm selling this saying this right. Riquito were Ketos on where? Ketos on. I hope I'm saying that right. I'm just reading. I never heard anybody say it. That's a big Japanese. He's huge. He's huge. And this match starts out like this starts out of pro wrestling match where they're like, you know, they're like doing a bunch of stuff. They're kind of allowing each other to push each other around in there. Somewhere in the match. It becomes like a war. And the big dude, that right there kicked the ball. So the righthand and this, this just turns into a fight. This is a 100 percent of fight now. Oh yeah. He's looking around panicking. He's panicking. He tries to clench and this is real. Now this is a real single, like he's fucked up. Look, the referee says don't do that. And boom, he punched him in the face.

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       He's poking him in. The eyes kicks out. Oh Shit, someone get. Wait for this though. Gets even crazier. Look at this hand slaps you soccer. Kicks Him, man. He had the headlock. Some. This is totally real now. Holy Shit. I mean he's fucked up right now and this dude is still beating his ass. My referee doesn't know if it's fake or not. I guess, I don't know, I mean, what's. Check this out. Here's the finishing Combo. The referee looks at his eyes. You'll find back in. Oh yeah, he's great. I think the refs afraid of kicking his ass to the park and look at that. Left the left hand that he dropped him with a hundred percent. Legit. One hundred percent. Legit back that up just a little bit. Jamie, to that last combination. Right about there. I mean this. You don't fake shit like this. Like when when he stood up, when he saw was a little bit before this.

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       Jim Did he soccer? Kicked him go a little bit before this. Yeah, but he was against the hips right there, Jimmy. That's good. See, this is when the dude is desperately scrambling trying to take him to the ground. And Ricky on again. I hope I'm saying that right. He's beating that ass. He was mostly doing open hands but he's kicking him too and then he kicks him again. Boom. The bitch slap right to the IR. Did he come? We'll walk to the rather and look at him and said, dude, what the fuck is going on here? Look at the boom. I mean that is. You cannot fake head kicks like that. That's 100 percent legit. This guy is getting the fuck beat out of him. It's crazy, man. I mean he gets up. He's already really, really badly fucked up. Like the referee checks is. Dude, don't worry about your. I think there's a good chance that that knockout was just him. Like, I don't know how to end this. Let me just drop to the fucking floor and pretend like I can't breathe. May Be Right. That last left hand holding onto the road.

Speaker 1:          00:03:41       He got fucked up. Man. That's so crazy. I've never seen anything like that before. A down dude. Stay. Stay down where it starts out just to pro wrestling. Match and turns into full on Valley Tuto. See, this is so cool. We were talking about this before the podcast started that it's so cool that shit like this exists and we can watch some like historical moments in martial arts. This is a historical moment. Wow. I wonder what the aftermath was. Did the guy match or something? No, he got murdered. Who got murdered? The big guy because of this problem. That's the story that you know, that's the legend is true. Who knows what I would glean to believe that that guy got his ass thoroughly kicked. He got. He got a double. Crossed him on TV and he couldn't abide. Yeah. Yeah. He could have died. He was getting soccer. Kicked hard. I can definitely see Komora having some deep connections with the Yakuza and they said we got to kill this motherfucker. That said, no rematch, no grappling match. No submission. Only. No metamorris kill this motherfucker. Just self killing them.

Speaker 1:          00:04:50       Killing them. Quit. They get ugly. The dude who put the video up is Ian Paisley is my hero. That's his name on the underground. So thanks to that dude. That was one of the most brutal ass kickings every time caught on video. And there's another dude who posted something. His name is a p o l o n I s t a polo. Nice dot. I guess you'd say it. Um, and he wrote a whole breakdown of what happened and apparently this Nikita's on guy, you know, Kimora was saying that recruiters on that he got taken for greed and the money and the fame, he lost his mind and just started beating the fuck out of the dude. And so apparently they stabbed him with a urine soaked knife. That's what the story is. This is so crazy. Who's died? Like days later we ran out of the poison to maybe only your own kits in Saudi. You're fucked. Well, you know, they do those poop things where they take poop and they transfer, they transmit fecal matter, transplant it to someone's, a intestinal tract and apparently it's

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       supposed to be like good for your body. Like to get that bacteria, like somebody else's bacteria in your body through a fecal transplant. Makes Sense. Kind of, but not really. Right. You wouldn't want to. That helps. That helped you think I'm joking. There's no waiting list for that shit. Yeah. You wait two years for kidney liver. Shit, dude. You better be white. Fresh shit should be at the operating table. No, they got fresh shit. Yeah. The doctors just shit, right. Dr. Deacon Hormones. No added hormones. Tired all the time. You need. You guys gave me some bullshit. It just doesn't happen. The right amino acid chains. So this guy ricky cheetos on like if you, if you watch that, that might be like one of the first ever double crosses that's on, like, like video. I don't think there's anything like that. Our worldstar hip hop, right?

Speaker 2:          00:07:15       So clear. Even though it's black and white 100 years ago, you see the strikes clearly and there's lights and that's one of the thug life video. Someone's definitely going sunglasses with drop down when he got his hands up for real man, that's, that's a ruthless. Ruth was beat down. Not Quite as ruthless as that night. Fucking horrible, horrible man telling me about it. But I just didn't. I wasn't, uh, I wasn't, I just didn't get to it. And then finally someone said, dude, sit down. Watch this shit. I've. Oh, okay. Well it's brutal too. We watched it on the air. Yeah, we watched it live. Not Live, but the first time I saw it and it was unbelievable. It was hard. It's hard to imagine that someone could do that. Just ran those dudes over. He's saying that now that the video is out and now he's gonna.

Speaker 2:          00:08:10       People are gonna. See the truth that it was self defense gun. He's crazy. That's what he said. I said one guys coming after him. I said gun. That's why we had to run them over because of the gun, but there was a. It seems like there was a gun in that video. I mean, or something that the guy took out and put in the gun spot behind your lower back. Let me just. Someone ever do that with a chrome like, man, let me get his comb. Kick it in the crack of your butt. You only put guns back there. When a guy does that and he sticks something behind their back. It's owning a gun. It's never a cell phone. It's never anything else. It's a fucking gun. That's it. It's a gun. Nobody puts anything back there but a gun. W what? What the fuck else you hold behind belts between

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       your ass cheeks and your pants belts. When I get promotions, I hide it behind my, but that's the only thing that's going to promote him. Your honor, you've been training for a straight three times a week. You're on three times. I have the documents here three times a week for two years. She was due for his brown belt. Yeah. Well he ran over the brown belt too. Then he wrote over that dude. That dude apparently lived. The second guy died. The second guy ran over his head. Yes. The Guy who went flying off screen. Frog, man. Yeah. That's the stories about that. They're gonna. Those are gonna. Go on for eternity. The rap world. Holy Shit. If you're, if you're in that rap music world, the more famous you get. It's like in China, the more famous you get in China, the triads takeover. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:09:52       They're like, you got to pay us on. We're responsible for this shit. You know, we own the movie houses or whatever, and in the rap world, the Tei is always walking around with the gun. He went to jail. It's like it's people are killing each other and get to big man. It's crazy how much the world is attached to like organized crime or crime or violence, so it's okay because we accepted Nwa. Nwa was not real. It was. It was like a like slayer pretending they were satanic. Nwa The dudes pretending to be ruthless gangsters in that album. You can even do an album like that. Now they rape a 14 year old, a preacher's daughter in the drive in and one of the songs, a fortune, they're pulling a train on her and the singing about it. It's a song about that. And then a song about killing hookers.

Speaker 3:          00:10:43       One less bitch I got to worry about. They have like little acting scenes in between every song. There's a scene where they pull up next to a hooker and she goes, hey, when you want, what'd you do? What'd you want to come in? And Oh look, you let me go shoot that bitch. Shoot that bitch. That bitch. That's part. That's before one less bitch. You know what I mean? That's okay. So we accepted all that shit. So not just accepted it, they sold it. Yeah, and it was huge. Huge. I mean it wasn't. None of it was true. It was just, it was like the extra and it's like a. The director and the writer, they're not satanic. Do you think that doing that though, just open the door to real thugs. Like how many real thoughts you've seen who Trinidad James, you know, that is no. To put a pull up. Trinidad James, all gold. Everything you tell me if this character is real or not, but this is. It's the craziest thing ever. Trinidad James Mileage. It's incredible. It's going to be your new favorite rapper. The name of the album, the name of the song is all gold. Everything. He's going to take over nods for me.

Speaker 3:          00:11:53       No, it's just got

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       my sweet spot. Anyways. What's that? Cleverly play this for you. You got a cleverly play this lie. So we don't get a yanked over here. Okay, well just don't show the video at all. Just show all of our faces like because it just go back and forth from that basis. Just let us see the video. Watch the video, we'll watch the video, we'll watch the video, all gold, everything. Oh, this is the explicit version. Let can check this out. Barbecuing. They have guns right away. Oh my goodness.

Speaker 4:          00:13:04       Nick, nick, nick,

Speaker 2:          00:13:09       that Bobby Carter and his crew, they all got arrested for this stuff. He's got a pump crew. Was Bobby me swagged out. Hold on. Jamie, what are you saying? Federal gun charges on him for what they're talking about in their songs. They went and looked at, looked at it and oh, these guys, not these guys, but there are people like this. Not In the same car or anything like that. Famous rap, but not these guys. Oh yeah. I had heard that recently. Some guy is in jail, some guy from San Diego for like a rapper and he's flashing gang signs. He's had no criminal history at all as different thing too. It's a different thing to. Well, that's a. that's a wonderful video. I liked his style. I like his office and he's got the puppy. That's the best day. All that shit. But he's got the cutest little puppy though.

Speaker 2:          00:13:58       Balance out all the gold. Have you seen the white kid with tattoos on his face? He calls himself stitches. No. Oh, I'm going to find you your new favorite song. Song Song. This is brick and your face is. My favorite trick is. Look, it's got $5. Million hits. America is in trouble. He's an 18 year old rapper from Miami. Stitches. Well, he's got a tattoo on his face of stitches across his mouth. Like the joke because he white or black. White as fuck. He's a white guy. Okay. White people representing 15. Got a dope car. I'll put the brick in your face.

Speaker 2:          00:14:43       I love this dude. Oh my God. Holy Shit. Ak Forty seven tattooed on his face. I'll put that brick in your face. Now what you're going to do with it. This is Florida. That's what this is. This is my new favorite rapper. I tell it to you is better than Trinidad. Jazz tells you like it's got to be sweet, and then this one, he's got all platinum teeth or gold cartel. The videos. Some rifles. Assault, right? Exactly. He needs a tank. Got To take your tank and wolverine. Is that Hell hellraiser? I love smelling. Selling. Oh, I love selling blow. He's running around with guns. Cocaine all over that. Say I love selling blow, but it's. It's flashing the word. Yeah, I love it. That was important. We have to make sure that the audience understands that. I don't think it's clear enough. You know what he said was arguments about it. Yeah. You know what he's doing, man. He's like, okay, everybody thinks they're crazy. Watch this. Watch this. When you think you fucking top the crazy Olympics, motherfucker. I'm going to tattoo guns on my face and stitches. I'm only 18 and I'm just going to say it. I love selling. Blow doesn't want to say it. I'm going to print it across the screen. I didn't have a gun in ever seen.

Speaker 2:          00:16:19       Wow. Does he? He doesn't even have any white friends. What's up with that? It's racist. No, you're better off. This is the. This is the way you guys video. He's the only white guy. White guys are laying there getting away. Except for him. He probably hates white people. Now what you're gonna do with it. That's what you get. What I'm saying? It's going to be all day. It's going to be in your head now. What going to do with it now? What you're gonna do. It's gonna be my new tagline after I submit people. Yeah. Now what's she going to do with it? That's rude. Gary Coleman. Gary. You first win and then stick. The White Guy was a hell raiser guy. You know what I mean? I think that was him. I think that was him with a mask on that was supposed to be him. I've just. My interpretation of it, I think he should have. He should have stayed 100 percent black shit. Hell raiser kind of brought it back to white people because black people don't like hell raiser and should've been spawn or stockton, you know, that's very good point because hell raiser was a white guy in the movie and black people hate scary movies generally speaking. I'm sure. Scary movies generally all stereotypical, stereotypical generalizations of how to raise up people.

Speaker 2:          00:17:42       You got to be able to generalize, generalize, you know what I mean? Cause if you can generalize and you can't make any fucking points, that's so true. You know what I mean? You can't make any points. I know. I know one guy that doesn't do that. My yes, I know a guy too, but generally Jesus Christ, that's one of the things are. Before you say what you just said, you go, yeah, I know this might sound a little bit racist, but I'm not racist. But you ever see that twitter feed? I'm not racist. It's all people saying racist shit. I'm not racist. But then they say some racist shit that was the most racist. How can you read some racist shit and not be accused of being racist? We'll find out. I don't think so, definitely not because if someone said, if someone was telling a story about some racist white guy who said the n word to a black guy, the black guy hit him or something.

Speaker 2:          00:18:33       Oh, can you tell that story and use and use that word or do you have to say it again when describing the story? It's a tough one, right? Because Howard stern just says the word because when he talks about someone else, so you get this one right here. Jamie. Stop right there. I'm not racist, but will not stand to see my country attacked by black whiners that feel sorry for themselves. Quit. Quit breaking the law ass. Oh, this is. These are real well put. Well put what? He's got a fucking moron. There's a difference between high levels of African American and a n word. Yeah. You don't even say the word until I'm Mexican, so I. I could actually get away with it if I say an Igg Iga, but am I. I can't do the other one, but you can't even say it. You can't not.

Speaker 2:          00:19:27       Not even calling something it not calling a person a nigger, but saying the word like me saying it right now and you're like, oh, you can't say it. How come you didn't say it? He just did it. You know, it's, it's, I think it's awesome. Like, you know what I mean? They have a word. It's no big deal. But like what if you got one until you can say wetback and stuff too. What if you're like reading to like a group of small children. You know, if the guy had called me a wetback, that would be very offensive. That doesn't seem that. It's not quite as strong as the n word, but it's, it's up there. It's like bronze metal. You know what I mean? An end is like the gold metal year after year. Not even being racist, but walking behind black people in the hallways is the last place I ever want to be. No, no. That's exactly what you're. What the. Not even being racist. Oh my God. I'm literally, I literally am not racist at all, but like I don't get why a lot of black people feel the need to be ignorant literally all the time. Wow. Wow. He's talking about Trinidad James. There's a double double literally and no period. I'm not feeling that sense. I'm not racist, but. But what is it? Caucasians,

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       Caucasians are evil as hell. Smh, I've got a real issue with Smh, which, what does that mean again? Shaking my head. I am just stop, stop, cut the shit. Especially white people. Oh my God. Look at this one. I'm not racist, but Justin, please stop hanging with black people. They are making you too ghetto people think you're trying to be black. Seth Rogan said about Justin Bieber, Howard Stern. He said, uh, that uh, he thought he was going to meet Justin. He thought, okay, he's going to actually be a cool guy. Watch. He expected me to be a cool guy, but seth throw him under the bus and he said he was a uh,

Speaker 3:          00:21:31       I don't know the exact words. I don't. Just the opposite of cool. Not, not a nice guy, a Douche bag. But you know what, I thought about that. He got so famous, so young and he's really fucking good looking. He's. He's a guest model now. He's on sunset and he's got his leg with the CIC for gas or something like that. The guy's a really good looking guy. If he. If he didn't have a. He wasn't a musician, he would still get mad chick. So how is a guy like that not going to be a Douche bag and possibly it is tough. He's up against them. Impossible. Everybody's kissing his ass all fucking day. He's really good looking. We can sing. He can. He's very talented. I mean his songs. I would never buy a cds, but the dude can sing really good. He could play guitar. He shreds on drums. He's been a musician his whole life. He's actually very talented, but there's no way that guy's going to make it through the teens. And I was 21, 22, 21 night just. But how you going to get there through all that and not be a Douche bag. It's impossible. Is a recent scientific study done that proves that assholes get more chicks.

Speaker 3:          00:22:39       John Danner just cued us into this one. I believe that they did a study. I'm not 100 percent sure where or when, but they had a women analyze photos of different pictures of men doing different facial expressions and the men with scowls and like their chest puffed out. Essentially what you would look at somebody and be like, oh yeah, that dude's an asshole. Like right off your perception. Right? Those got higher ratings in terms of good looks than the guys that were smiling and looked happy signs, typically chicks, but those studies are all who's. Who were the people that were in those studies. That would make a huge difference. If it was young people, older people, I could make a huge difference. I haven't done a full analysis of this study yet. I would want to know. Right? Like whether it's college kids that are young and don't know any better or whether it's women in their thirties. I would like to know like where the drop off point is with chicks, get tired of dudes with their chest sticking out, you know that for whatever reason might be appealing for an 18 year old. I think girls like that in the beginning and then they end up fucking hating. It kills zone. You know what

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       I mean? They were attracted to the barbarian and the fucking wild savage. But then now they got them that damn, I wish he wasn't such a fucking savage because other bitches like that too. So then they ended up hating that shit. Right? Wouldn't, couldn't be. Yeah. But it's okay because that acid is just going to move onto another chick. That's totally okay with that. So while, until it wears off, that asshole is not looking to settle down with like one chick, you know? Depends which asshole. Well you know what I think it is. I think we're still stuck with the echoes of some ancient Dna. I think we still have, for whatever reason, we still have all the instincts that people had back when you had to worry about like marauding hordes coming over the top of the hill with swords and knives, like you had to be kind of an asshole back then, you know, and you had a fuck more than one chick because your kids are all going to get killed by arrows and fucking flying body.

Speaker 5:          00:24:38       So that's a good point. It's a very good point. If you're living back then, man, you had tons of DNA spreading mean. They used to have fertility rituals. Whether you would hope that people got pregnant. The exact opposite of what we do today today. Everybody's like, please get her fucking period please. And back then they were. They had rituals and by the time we were in our twenties, in a way before we had kids, those people back in the day like we're all our DNA came from. They were on their way out the door. They not only had kids, they were getting old and they were going to be dead by the time they're in their thirties. It'd probably be killed or disease or something so that crazy. The reason why we're here is because the same reason why women would like a guy that's aggressive or an asshole because she thinks that guy could protect her.

Speaker 5:          00:25:25       It's this bizarre fucking trick that nature is played on this, this thousands of years of evolution technologically and historically and how much information we have in the way we could communicate with each other. Still doesn't work. Still doesn't stills in totally stopped at monkey. Fuck gene. That's still deep down in the back because chicks want some guy who could defend the castle. Is that true, Garrett? Thanks. So study. Study proved that man, your personal study. What's not my case study. Now I wish. I wish. I wish I. I'm working on becoming more and more of an asshole. I'm trying to get better at it and not people that have fucking acl reconstruction. Then I'll do my best. You know, man, I'm chasing that dream because I. it's clear that they are more successful with women. For sure. Donna has a wizard that Kai, he is such an interesting dude. Such an interesting guy to talk to. Such a smart guy. I actually don't train there for the technique at all. It's just for the stories that he tells us. And so you were saying before the podcast that data her, you went to Danaher's to get a private or something like that at first or train with them. And then he, uh, introduced you to his leg lock system? Oh, um, yeah. I mean just when we started, when I started training with John, um,

Speaker 6:          00:26:44       you know, first it was just an inconsistent basis, like once a once a week or so, you know, a lot of MMA fighters come to like a Monday afternoon class. So I was going in there and that was when I was in college. I didn't have time to go over all the time, but once I started going there consistently I got a chance to see like kind of the strategies that he teaches and leg locks aren't like his main focus. But I think he's made huge innovations in the leg lock game to the point where like, you know, when he teaches it, it seems like that's like his main thing, you know. But uh, yeah, no, it's definitely went over like our whole leg lock game. Me and uh, you know, Eddie, Eddie Cummings. Yeah. Um, both of our games just stemmed from that for sure.

Speaker 6:          00:27:23       You know what I mean? He's such a smart dude. Yeah. So, so on the ball about so many things about, you know, all sorts of different aspects of life. He's a very interesting perspective. Somebody recently asked me what was the best advice I'd ever been given and I, I continually preach it. This is it. And uh, that, uh, John always tells us never to get married, but he lists for four reasons why you could possibly get married. Um, these are four circumstances, all of which have to exist. All right. Otherwise, marriage just isn't an option. Okay. The first all at the same time, it was for all four. Otherwise it's. Yeah. And then the offers on the table, it's not like you definitely have to get married. It's like, alright, we understand why, so the first is that the woman has to be between the ages of 18 and 25.

Speaker 6:          00:28:06       Okay. Second is that you have to be over the age of 55. The third is that you have to have no money and the fourth is that she has to have tons of money. Otherwise it's just not even a question. Don't get that even in the wheel house. Oh my God. That's funny. That is hilarious. And I think he recently added some innovations to that theory with like the woman has to be an info maniac or something like that. He keeps making it harder and harder to get married as we as we go along. I would love to see her debate like an angry woman.

Speaker 6:          00:28:41       It would be. I'm sure he's done that many, many times, but on those points. So he's not married. I don't see that happening anytime soon. What's that? Does he have a girlfriend? We don't know anything about his personal life. He's a superstar you? No, no. Honestly, even if I. I don't, we, we'd never. We're not the player. What's that? Would you consider him a player? I can't answer any questions like that. I don't know. I just, I'll tell you, this is my car guy. You guys think like we're like best friends with them because he trained with him all the time. We know nothing about this guy as a human being, you know, like, just like the little bits of pieces of the stories. We never hang out with them. None of that stuff. Like it's a, he's an enigma for sure. Like what he does once he steps off the mat, if he disappears into the ether, as far as I'm concerned, I have no clue. Let's give a. He was a philosophy student right when he started training in Jujitsu. Yeah. Yeah. GotTa. Get him on the podcast. I was super smart guy. Yeah, that would be an insane podcast. Yeah, he'd be great. I would definitely

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       love to have that. Meanwhile, Gary, you're competing tomorrow at the Eddie Bravo invitational here in La and it's at the orpheum, the orpheum theater, downtown La, the orpheum. Amazing, amazing place to have startup four doors and the paper view starts at four. It's going to be on bluedot videos.com/Ebi, 1499, and if you, even if you don't train, if you're thinking about training, you've sound like, ma'am, I'm neither. Should do something. You would watch how fun it is. Watch how exciting it is. I think that the only reason why Jujitsu and submission grappling, the way you're doing it on your show was the only reason why that's not on television. It's just people aren't, they're not accustomed to it. Like you're accustomed to having golf on TV. So you sit there and watch golf or you're accustomed to having cricket and some parts of the world like try watching cricket.

Speaker 5:          00:30:26       You ever been in England? If the channel and crickets on your. Like what? The couple of times just to see if I could figure it out by watching it and I'm like Nope, I don't know why they keep running. John told us that way. Cool. History about cricket. They used to be a a guy that was known, so at first they were only throwing like 70 mile an hour pitches and they started to increase it up to like, you know, in the nineties and the 100 mile an hour pitch range and a cricket. You're allowed to purposefully throw the ball at the person that's bagging. So these guys would just wail people like in the face and they were just known for that became famous for just smashing people in the face. How does that benefit you if you're hitting the. What's that? How does that.

Speaker 5:          00:31:04       How is that good? I guess? I guess if you hit the guy and like, you know, fuck them up enough, it's going to be hard for him to hit the ball and hitting the knock them out. I don't know how that works, man. The guy hitting the ball have all the gear on who has the gear. Yeah. They see this is back when they didn't even really have that much gear to where they weren't even allowed to wear helmets or anything like that. No, no. Here's the question. Why would you not try to hit the guy every fucking time? I think that. I think that's. I was trying to do. I think that's why you have a giant wide paddle for a defensive tool that it affects a tool that's in that circumstance aim for the head every time you think it was like that paddle work better back when people were only throwing like 60, 70 miles an hour.

Speaker 5:          00:31:46       But now they're like majorly pitch. You ever seen the guy throw a fast ball like a major league fastball? It's Kinda terrifying me. It's insane. I've seen it live. It's Kinda terrifying. This speed at God can throw a ball. It's Kinda like, like Eagle. Whoa. Look at that swing. It's, it's, you're guessing. It's like in that area. Yeah. Well you're hoping that he's aiming for, you know what I mean? Specifically your area. So who was the guy that died and then they started instituting those helmets. He's a, it was a famous baseball player. He got hit and the owe me might not have died. He might've gotten like really fucked up. It was never the same again. But I believe he played for the Red Sox, but it was when I was a kid, it's kind of got hit with a ball and it really fucked up and his career was done. It was never the same again. I remember thinking, man, like one ball can do that. You can get hit with one ball and you're done with the fuck. Was that your last name? Hayward.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       I don't know. It was, uh, it was, uh, it was a famous case. Wade. Bob died late nights. Different guy. He died later. Fuck, you know, this is probably some sports fans right now. Screen when you got the whole fucking story wrong. Faggot. You've got the whole June. Even the white grease ball. My point being, if Jujitsu is on TV, if they got to see some wild matches, especially one of the things I appreciate about watching your match, I got exposed to you by Eddie. The first one I saw was you and chrome.

Speaker 3:          00:33:14       Yes. We talked about. We talked about it. That was an exciting match.

Speaker 1:          00:33:20       Whoa. That was two dudes to do like, just razor sharp assassins trying to chop each other down. Man, what a match. Just what a match. That was incredible. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:33:33       the first time I met you was at that seminar, right. And in Florida for you at that seminar in Florida, Florida. No. It thing. So we, you know. Well, what ended up happening was the reason why he did Ebi one was originally I was going to do the sub only worlds that, that was going to sw. Oh, that's what it was going to be. And Scotty from on the Mat, he, he knew he was on board. He goes, dude, that's a great idea. Let's do it. Me maybe a sponsor. And he goes, but can I get my boy Gary Tonin in there for sure because we were going to do a one slash 70, the first one. Sub only world one 70, 60 man bragging. And I didn't even, I hadn't even heard of you. How do you keep. I don't keep track of, of the top Jiu Jitsu guys.

Speaker 3:          00:34:11       I really don't. I don't know about it either. So, um, I can barely keep track of the guys in the UFC. And he said, I got to get Gary Toner and I go, well, what I'm trying to do is get the best submission guys. I'm not, I don't care about the best ib jj of points guys. I don't want points guys. I want submission guys because he's good. I go, okay. You sure? Okay. Like I was going to put him in as a favor. I never even, I didn't know this guy. So sub only worlds. We had investors interested and then it fell through and then by the time I was ready to start pushing it again, I decided a victor got involved. Victor Dobby loud from the UFC. He's a Spanish commentators, systematic Joe Rogan. He got them all said, let me be the unvested let me produce it.

Speaker 3:          00:34:52       And it's called Eddie Bravo. Invitational. So. And I thought, hmm. And he gets, he wanted to her to call it that for a recognition he doesn't do. People would know right away. And it was his idea. Ebi was his idea. I was like calling up my name, are you sure? But then as you think with a business mind, you think, okay, that is a good idea. Let me put myself out there. And, and I was uh, you know, uh, we were gonna do, Metamorris was already in the works and it'll be perfect. My name would be back. We can boom, we could piggyback off that, you know, so I thought it was a good strategy. It's a great strategy. I have a well established name already to try and build up something else. So much harder. So the very first one we did one 70 and we did the featherweights too.

Speaker 3:          00:35:32       We're doing UFC weights and Gary, of course, you know, he was going to be in sub only Scotty from under. Matt was involved in. He said, my boy, Gary, you've got to put them in. And by that time I, I, I bjj, Kuma Tay was out and I remembered who he was. That was the guy that was Scotty Nelson's boy. So then went to Abu Dhabi 2013. And um, I remember the first time we met there, we were at the hotel lobby and I still didn't know you were just like, hey guys, I didn't even know it was like, Oh shit. And then he goes on. It was one of the greatest Abu Dhabi, even though you didn't get the gold medal, it was one of the greatest performances because that fight with chrome was absolutely incredible. And then after that, after you almost pulled it off, but he ended up finishing it.

Speaker 3:          00:36:19       That's what made it crazy to, that's tricks and Sun and Hickson's coaching. But after that you did the absolute 175 pounds you want against Blue Shesha in Cyborg. And those guys couldn't tap you. You were going after them. I mean, Jesus Christ, this is the guy that just almost look at them in the absolute, the smallest dude in the absolute. He gets the biggest. He gets the two champions, Cyborg one, a, the absolute ambush. Esha won the heavyweight class. So they fought twice in the finals. One time. Boucher, one, one time cyborg wearing. So that's crazy in itself. But he went against both of them. God Damn sideboards. Giant man. Like it has to be like 2:30 plus at least. Yeah. When he was doing the metamorris match with sharp, I was like, this guy's sick. He's really strong. Super technical, really good off his back, and then boom, after that we're like, Holy Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:37:13       He's got some ridiculous guard. What do you call it? Tornado. Tornado, garden. I've seen them in videos. It's a tornado guard. Is that what it's called? Especially with the gies. Amazing. He's. He's one of the bigger guys that started to. Started to be moved like a lighter guy when it comes to Jujitsu, used to just be like two big fat is falling all over each other in the head. Guy For dude over to 30. There's nobody that has. I haven't seen. I mean, as far as I'm sure there's guys and in Sao Paolo somewhere that are, they're just as good. I don't, I don't have my finger on all that. But what I've seen out of the famous guys, Cyborg is a big dude. Nobody move. I don't see anybody moving my camera, his half guard. It's insane. I can't even play as hell. I'm like, that's a whole different kind of half guard.

Speaker 3:          00:37:54       I'm trying. I've got a couple of students that are on the case. I'm like, go study him. We're going to eventually bring that shit and that's on the table because it's working at a high level. He gets under dudes and with his hamstrings fucking launches. It's crazy. We should call him by his name because everybody thinks cyborgs. The chicken fights for our brand Jujitsu, Cyborg, Cyborg, Jujitsu. Cyborg is super yoga and there's a lot of great videos of him doing strength and conditioning work online to that motherfucker is stupid strong, and there's another Cyborg that does Jujitsu and MMA to what? Yes. This is smiling cyber. That's the guy that Nick Diaz aren't

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       to remember that that guy. Sideboard tips, right? Well, that cyborgs husband. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Ex husband. Yeah. Yeah. There's a bunch. Of course. And bottom line is gary went to. I got to watch that fight again because I mean they could. They were so frustrated. These giant superstar legends are already living legend. Both of them already. Just he's a fucking animal and he couldn't tap them is crazy. Did you know about cyborgs guard? Like, did you understand it? My, my, uh, teacher Tom the blast and my original teacher, um, uh, he fought him in Abu Dhabi in 2009, 2011, something like that. I guess where was, which one was in Barcelona a doesn't matter, but anyway, he thought of it. Um, so, you know, I did a little studying on him just because, uh, you know, uh, my, my teacher, we fought them and that it was a very controversial match, like kind of, uh, when you look back at it, it looks like they kind of screwed Tom.

Speaker 5:          00:39:37       So, um, you know, that for me, like I definitely was familiar with them. I watched videos of him and stuff like that after that. But I'd say he'd made leaps and bounds from that point. Uh, you know, I really, I didn't, I took his Jujitsu a little bit for granted before that fight. He in that Abu Dhabi, uh, you did. So I felt like it was like the biggest, uh, like a climax of his career for sure. In terms of his technique. It was, it was on that if that event for sure. Two trains hard. Yeah man, definitely trends heart. That's interesting. Um, when you, when you see a guy like that and you see like those, those leaps and bounds, what, what do you attribute that do? Do you attribute that to like the high level Jujitsu that's available today? Everybody has to kind of keep up.

Speaker 5:          00:40:18       What do you attribute it to? Just I'm just like people. I think overall people getting better, right? We all admit that, right? Yeah. I mean you guys have today are about, there's guys that stand out in my mind, you know, it's always going to be more so Garcia in Hickson in his prime and so he's going be these guys that stand out, but the guys that today it seems like if you're, if you wanted to get into Jujitsu and watched submission grappling like the Ebi tomorrow, it's just. No, no better time. Like if people are finishing people now and every day I got a bunch of Jujitsu nerds and my association and my homeschool, they're just, every time I see a cool clip, every time I see a cool clip of a new transition that Jeff Glover put on it, you know, on instagram or whatever, I'll tell my little Jujitsu, Gina says, you see that one new, a half guard sweep seen it.

Speaker 5:          00:41:01       Like everyone just seem to come up with new shit shit that I saw in a video and I thought I might going to teach us tonight and uh Oh, you're doing it wrong. And I've seen that video a thousand times and that was the only one that was going to give us steel and move. Well, that's a beautiful thing about Jujitsu. That's misunderstood. A lot of people think that it's a, it has to do with strength and aggression and think of it as being like this thing. But so many of the guys that do it, they are like, if they weren't doing this would be building computers or something. We talk about it all the time. It's crazy how we could actually dedicate this time to something that people actually care about and we could actually make money or something, you know, so, um, but yeah, that's definitely more of the mindset for most of them.

Speaker 5:          00:41:48       There are those, you know, muscle head kept guys. There's a few of those for sure. But guys like you, the thoughtful, intelligent guys seem to always rise to the top. They figure out how to always have the best answer to whatever problems in front of them. Yeah, that's what we're really looking for. I mean, that's the theory that I try to pass on to my students and stuff. Um, you know, as opposed to like I tell it at seminars all the time. I'm like, guys, if you're ever doing a move and you're just like, this isn't working, the reasons probably not because you're not pushing harder or you need to go faster, you know what I mean? Like that's not the reason something's not working. It's because your techniques flawed, you know, you're doing it for his defense is good. Yeah. Either or. Yeah, there's a lot.

Speaker 5:          00:42:28       That's one of those things that, oh, I always used to like laugh when people would talk about it. When it comes to a complicated techniques, like some of you are rubber guard techniques, that takes a long time to get flexible and you have to do the reps to pull them off and people would say, oh, that's. That doesn't work, and we would always laugh like, okay, dad kicks work, learn how to do a head kick right away. Like this is a perfect example, right? Like head kicks, like a wheel kick to the head. How long is that going to take someone out? You can't say it doesn't work. Watch the two or rockhold 5 million fights. Now there's a lot of them. So in a lot of ways Jujitsu is is like everything else, right? There's going to be these levels that you see of it that are super high and then you realize what's possible and you go, oh, and then along the way you got a lot of people are second guessing a lot of doubters.

Speaker 5:          00:43:15       A lot of people that don't think this is going to work or that's going to work, there's just so many moves in Jiu Jitsu. It's unlike any other sport. It's endless. Ever. All the top guys have their own style. There's so much to learn in. The only way to get good at certain transition or move is to spend a lot of time with that certain move or that transition. You don't have that much time, so the smart thing to do, it's because sometimes you're working on a transition that might not pan out and you hit it a dead end. So you're like, dude, you don't know what moves to spend this precious time with. So you look at the pop guys and what are they doing? They already done the research and development at works, so now you know what safe to put reps into one.

Speaker 5:          00:43:56       That's a safe one and the safe ones are the best ones. Right. I think the compliment to that though is like, so you look at that and I seen, I've seen people do it. People that used to be on our team, it would look at these guys, what are the top guys do and focus on that, but you focus too much on it. Those top guys like let's take like the Menendez brothers for instance. All right. With like Baron Bolo, right? Yeah. Okay. These guys are doing a move that they've perfected, right? Yes. So sure I could study what they're doing and learn what they're doing, but am I going to be able to make. Am I going to be able to make the same headway that they have with that move? Probably not. So I probably need to pick up a different facet of my game and headway with that move.

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       You know what I mean? Then that's what I try to do. You know, that that's what I tell people that, oh, you know, what's the best way to get, you know, a step forward in competition, a step ahead of the game and I think it's being somewhere being in a position more than other people are in that position and developing that not so much what you see other people doing. If you're constantly just trying to do what other people are doing, you're going to get caught up in that game and they'll always find a way to submit you because they've been doing it longer. You know what I mean? I think that's the like the opposing strategy to what you were just talking about because I totally agree with you. I. I have. I use both strategies. I always promote and push to keep your goto moves polished and not forget about your goat tools.

Speaker 3:          00:45:12       Those are your special moves. Anytime a new student comes, a a new student comes to me and they see them developing a move. Even if it's a move that I suck and I'm like, that's your move right there. I remind them, I go, that's yours. Get really good at that. That's your secret weapon. You got to have secret weapons, but at the same time I have new students starting every day, so I like to expose them to everything that's working out there and create their own style. Even though personally I teach the baron bullets part of our warmup system. I'm not ever going to be a bar polo player. I messed with it every now and then when I'm rolling with a 12 year olds and women, all the shit out of a white belt girl. I'll do that. I know, but I know eventually eventually I'm going to get really good at that in like 10 years and then they'll be able to attack with it, but right now you stick to your Goto, keep those strong and take your go tos to the highest level but also also have a constant introduction of new stuff in your game.

Speaker 3:          00:46:10       It'll pay back later, maybe 10 years down the road, 15 years down the road where maybe it's not your game now, but it will be after the light, like I'm killing it. You definitely need to take all those elements from the good guys for what they do for sure. And it's really no other martial art like that. Right. That has so many different moves too. There's just. It's incredible. It's like a five dimensional martial art. It's. Yeah. I mean it just keeps getting better and better at over the years. Like Joe was saying before, you know, the progression of Jujitsu in general and the level of it is just going up and up and I think the biggest innovations that are happening now are probably in the leg lock game frontier for you and Eddie and Eddie come into a big part of that big part of that.

Speaker 3:          00:46:50       Since they want a 10 plan, they want. We have never outlawed a heel hooks or reaping. I just never wanted to get heavy on heel hooks because I want her to train my fighters for MMA. I don't want them to the first habit to go to heal hooks because it's a little dangerous when the highest nine guys are telling me when my leg lock school guys are telling me, manny, Carl, caren. Oh Bro, bro. MMA leg logs, last resort. You don't want to give a position when they're saying that. I'm like, okay. But I never discouraged it, but I had leg lock, like [inaudible], one of my black belts. Very good at leg locks. Denny got really good at. Like I told denegall five years ago, submerse yourself in leg locks. I want. He's not going to do mma. I go, so

Speaker 6:          00:47:30       leg locks are very important for you. Uh, but then when we saw what you did in Ebi, one leg lock the shit out of everybody. And then in the grapplers quest, ultimate absolute in the Obi wan and the finals, you beat Richie Martinez, one of my guys, you heal, hook them inside hook. And then at the grapplers quest, ultimate, absolute, or ultimate whatever submission only I get those mixed up. It was you and Nathan Orchard at the end of that 16 man, another one of my black belts. And you've got them with the inside. He'll hook again. From that point, Nathan decided, you know what? He started studying everything you were doing and we to me, I never got deep into my. I got a good crippler or a game over whatever people call both legs reaped. I got when I escaped the mountain, I go to that. I'm good at that.

Speaker 6:          00:48:18       He'll hook, but generally I'm not good at heel hooks. Never really looked into it. I didn't know the system. I didn't know the system until Nathan studied your personal game and then showed it to me and I'm like, wow, it's like rubber guard because people don't. People think like rubber guard is just reaching up and grabbing your legs and hold on and throwing up an arm bar. They don't realize there's our system. There's all these positions as a path. I didn't realize it was this exact same thing for when I first started training leg locks. I like, I walked in like Eddie had already done a lot of, you know, made a lot of headway in the leg lock game and obviously, you know, John had been teaching him so, you know, when I first came in, my intentions were always preparing for ADCC. It's, my intentions were like, all right, I want to know a little bit about this leg lock game.

Speaker 6:          00:49:01       I'm going to be competing in a tournament where he looks her legal, which I don't usually do. You know, I want to be ready for this. You know, we're ready for whatever people are gonna throw me. I'm just going to learn how to do it well enough that I can defend it and then I learned that it's like a whole different martial art just like walks in and I'm like, what the fuck? I'm like, I wanted to ask John because I'm so frustrated I'm not passing Eddie's guard because just keeps blocking me. And I'm like, so you know, when a guy's good at lego logs, how do you pass the guard? He's like, fucking learning logs dude. See you got to learn how to, how to do what he's doing so that you know, the counters and everything. So I realized I had to spend time on it, you know, as opposed to just dismissing it as like a small part.

Speaker 6:          00:49:37       When you see someone, when you see someone dismiss them in mma, like the highest armed guy saying don't do it because it's last resort, but then you see a guy like I was gonna say that one you guys about. What do you think? Like blocks today, leg locks in mma. What do you think? I just think there needs to be. There's a few guys that are using them well and I just, I think that, uh, you know, there's just not enough people out there that are confident enough in them have I've done enough technical research to make them useful, you know what I mean? If you teach one dude is shitty healed. Yeah, absolutely. But what do you think about as far as specifically? So it's terrifying. The guy knows that he has a confidence in his heel, hooking nosy can break a limb with it and he finds in every different situation. Most of our transitions we get from, you know, oh, Pahara got a leg there. He got to like here, you know, he learns how to get there from many different positions and that's what I was talking about and kind of what Eddie was

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       talking about with finding that thing that's like yours, you know, he's there all the time. So if he can get you there, boom, you're done. You know, you don't know what you're doing. Exactly. You're thinking he's already moved on instance. This is what I'm thinking about. Leg locks is a, I hear this stuff from highest on, you know, 10 years ago. Yeah. I hear my, one of my purse, my first MMA fighter was, he was rubber guard twister. He lives like, uh, like I, I created this guy, but he also had a leg lock out any did MMA and every time he tried to go for leg locks he got knocked out. Yeah. So that came. There was a, there was a point where uh, he had to. It was too dangerous. Yeah, after like 12, five. But then, um, you have uh, uh, Hussam [inaudible] coming out coming out of nowhere and people I think are still giving them more like, well he's making the leg locks work because he shows strong and he's so scary.

Speaker 3:          00:51:17       And so because people do feel like we need to see it a few more times from different people. Hey, I hope leg lock works. The more submissions on the ground, the better. I love the way with smart pull in garden, the leg locks. He's not even trying to take dudes down. Well, you know what I think is when Alan belcher figured it out, yes, Alan belcher figured it out. I mean he willingly went into his half guard. He willingly went to the ground with. That's the biggest mistake. People make up poems. He defended every single step of the way and then beat them down and stop them. I think at the high level, that's what it looks like. I think if the guys is kind of shaky about leg locks and he's not like, he doesn't have leg lock defense in his DNA, he's going to get caught.

Speaker 3:          00:51:54       But Alan spent two months solid with a dean lister floorman a Davi Ramos who's a mini pet horse leg and he said the first two weeks he just got leg locked all day and after a while you learn how to slow it down and then you get tapped and you slow it down and then you get tapped and you slow it down and then you start attacking because that's what he said. So I think maybe with the leg game, if everybody got really good at the defense that yes, you can get, you can get in these positions and avoid getting hit because I think the saddle and the honeywell, I think it's pretty safe right where you ain't going to get hit there, they can't reach you. But if the guy defends it and is comfortable defending it and then can sit up in a certain spot and sprawl out on you, then it could be a trouble.

Speaker 3:          00:52:40       I'm not a, I'm rooting for leg locks and mma. Trust me, I'm just not 100 percent I need is once the punches coming, once they start flying. I hear Ryan Hall is making leg lock works in an MMA training. So uh, maybe maybe like maybe leg locks, um, will be the future of or part of the future of grappling. And well, you know, we always have this conception but this idea of it because of Frank Mir versus Ian Freeman. I mean, that's like cemented in people's heads. Remember Frank Mir is going for the heel hook look like he's got it locked up. And he's like, Ian Friedman's teeing off on his face while he's holding onto his leg that was, gets he stomped on me. He got fucked up that. And that was when frank was a monster. I mean, frank was real young, wild and aggressive. Romeo Santo and walking

Speaker 6:          00:53:25       Hanson. Assad was very good at leg locks, had a toehold, what can enhance and caught him once and hit them two or three times. And he was just how it started. So, okay, who's caring? Who's got better leg locked technique imagery or Paul Harris because [inaudible] has worked some dudes needs to. I think in an Aria is probably more technical. What do you think? Um, no I, no I didn't come and says no. Yeah, I think that you're, you're seeing kind of, first of all, you're seeing two people, um, do leg locks to people that are, that don't have any clue what they're doing when it comes to like locking, right? So it's in the MMA world, not to discredit anybody that uses them effectively and under nay pars is using them effectively in both. Um, but then when you're watching people use like locks and fights, you can't just credit, you can just be like, oh my God, that dude's leg locks are amazing because they're going, again, in terms of grappling, they're going on somebody that doesn't have any clue what they're doing most of the time anyway.

Speaker 6:          00:54:20       Um, but uh, in terms of, you know, who's, who's better, I mean it's clear that the headway that [inaudible] is made with an outside, he'll hook is just way above anyone else. [inaudible] has some other, I'd say men are better at some of these technical transitions that he does. Some very unique, you know, counters and unique, uh, you know, attacks entries as well. Yeah, I mean we definitely study them and try and use some of that stuff. So I think he's just a little bit more creative, a little bit more unique, but I don't think necessarily. I think Paul Harris has a better system. Okay. Paul Harris has a better system for breaking a limb as opposed to a lot of creative transitions and can eventually submit somebody. But you know, if you ever think about getting a private with Paul Harris, uh, no, because I, you know, I favor my knees and I don't want to get.

Speaker 6:          00:55:09       Oh, you definitely just break my legs for sure. I mean, he'd try anyway. We'd say, oh for sure. For sure. Dude. The guy's a crazy person. They brought in a sports psychologist to try and like, hey, why are you breaking your training partners legs and everybody's legs and competition and not letting go. And the sports psychologist after week was like, fuck this. I don't know what the day brought him in because he was breaking his, his training partners to camps and stuff. Dude. Yeah. Whoa. God Damn Eddie, you're nodding as well. Yeah. Just wondered. Confirmation across the board. So he had a tow childhood man. You hear about his childhood that, that big scar across his chest. They tried to Krazy glue. That shit's shut when he was like a kid. Wow. Yeah. He grew up on a farm, a pig slop, and he was like 13.

Speaker 6:          00:55:52       It's a really heartbreaking story. Not surprised at all. Been working since he was like a little kid. It's one of the reasons why he's so fucking strong. Pig slop has something to do with it. You got to start getting pixel up. I'm sure you added some other things. Says Diet once you got some of them wake up in the morning. It's just super dense in protein. Tastes like shit, but it's good for your plus. It's like an instant fecal transplant as well because reading a little bit of picture in there. Perfect. Me. See his fight with Fitch.

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       Uh, no I haven't. I've been watching a lot of highlights specifically actually explained it. Alan belcher actually went over like what he did wrong. Like it's pretty interesting man. He had a video outlining the technique, how to defend and how par has went to straight leg lock. Nobody did and what he should or the way you have done it. And the way you did do it. So really interesting. Alan Belcher is a wizard when it comes. That's the way Paul Harris got the fight to the ground. He's fighting John Fitch, Ncaa Division One wrestler. How did he take them down? He didn't even try, he just shot for a week, single and just sat down and went for a leg lock. Once he gets a hold of you, it's like you have a whole new level of Oh fuck. Like everybody has in their head like a level of Oh fuck.

Speaker 5:          00:57:07       Like, okay, I'm okay here. I'm okay here. I can defend here. But I think he's so God damn strong. And on top of that it's technique. So sharp. Then went to grabs a whole, you see this look on dudes faces. They're like, Oh shit, I'm not getting out of this. Guys are letting him get where he wants to be though, you know, like most of them anyway. Um, you know, the better strategy is to put him where you want them as opposed to, Oh yeah, I'm just going to keep this on the feet. No you're not, you're not going to keep this on the feet. He's going to find a way to get to the leg lock, lock guard, put them, put them down, put them down. Shows you what a Demon Hector Lombard is. Because Hector Lumbar was like getting a hold of my legs. He beat the shit out of him.

Speaker 5:          00:57:44       How did the fight go? Stoppage. Lombard stopped him. He just couldn't take them down. Couldn't take them down, couldn't get him into leg lock, couldn't do anything with them. Never got him to the ground. Did he try to pull dark to Lombard? Is Stupid. Strong, stupid, strong. He's the only guy I've ever seen lockup with Tim Bush and just face plant him just by, by polar like Tim Bush was trying to shoot and take them down and he sprawled and just slammed him into the ground like he's so God damn strong. And on top of that he's got ridiculous technique. You know his judo is off the charts and then he's got submissions to men. There's a video of him in a submission. Grappling match. We snapped to dude's leg and you can hear it. You could hear the snap. Nothing grip. Which one? Lombard. Hector Lombard gets a dude in a leg lock and snaps his leg.

Speaker 5:          00:58:30       I think I've seen it. Sounds like you've got them in like a straight ankle lock. And you hear a crack number, John Lobur got his foot broken off with a toehold in Japan. The whole foot just broke off and he's just looking at it. They flipped hanging and the ref stops it. And he's like, oh shit, the pancreas. But the whole, it was like a, like, um, Anderson Silva's leg tonight, Jesus Christ. When you really stop and think about the progression over the years and all the crazy fights you put like you gotta wake your brain up to that fight. Have you guys looked into the CSW leg lock system with Eric Paulson? You guys look at him and I trained at a school once, um, but you know, in terms of like looking at their system of like Luxe, I'm not as attuned to it. Eddie. Eddie does a lot more research than me, you know, as you called people, Bjj nerds, that's for sure. Um, so

Speaker 6:          00:59:22       you're just like, Eddie, what? What's next? What does it mean? Shit? Yeah. You don't want to go. I do a little bit of research, but it's not. I don't do extensive stuff. You know what I mean? I've just trained it all the time and you know, I, I, luckily I live in an age where have all these people around me that, you know, study and, you know, the martial art, you know, like, I always think about that, like, think back to like, what was it like when nobody knew what the fuck they were doing and you just had to make everything up and you had nothing to go off of, you know what I mean? Now we're in this era where it's like, you know, I could go to John with pretty much anything. I'm going to get 95 percent accurate answer to whatever question is that I have because he's seen it 100 times before on tape, you know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          00:59:57       Um, we don't have to innovate as much. Are you planning on finding an mma? Yeah. One or two years, you know, I gotta I don't know old people in the face yet. So how old I am? Twenty three. And um, so you're just concentrating on striking before you do it. Yeah. I just want to learn. I want to know what I'm doing before. I do know, wrestled your whole life, right? Uh, I wrestled from fifth to ninth grade and I started doing Jujitsu so it gave me a little bit of a grappling based, but it wasn't a, you know, I mean, it wasn't, you know, I knew how to do a single and a double leg, like things in the ground. Nothing serious. Nothing that I really remember. Now I do wrestling privates with a d, One guy Matt Fletcher. I'm on a biweekly to two a week.

Speaker 6:          01:00:35       And what kind of striking training you're doing? Striking training has started working with Frank Savannah, a boxing coach. She's, I'm just doing it like once a week. Right. You don't have time to. I am in Manhattan, but I haven't checked anybody out in the area. I've just been doing stuff in Jersey, bringing people to me because I run a school. So it's hard for me now because Enzo is who's connected with a lot. Right. Like Phil nurse doesn't want you guys all somewhat somewhat connected. You have some guys teaching, but um, you know, I haven't gotten in touch with those guys. Um, it's just, I'm just a real basic level right now, so I just want to get to a point where I can start going to some professionals, but it's almost like with Jujitsu, without knowing anything, like what uses it to go to the best guy in the world, you know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          01:01:19       Well, you know what dude with a guy, as good as you are, I think the most important thing is you go to like whoever you go to, if you decided to embark on your mma career, go to someone, but it's got a full knowledge like a for Rasa hobby type. Dude, look, someone's got a full knowledge of MMA. Guys are so gigantic. I don't think they get the credit that they deserve. Yeah man, the Duke Roufus is of the world and you know, those, those guys that just look, look at the whole package of what you do as a fighter and piece together the right strategy for you. We have good connections with a, you know, for us, for us and that camp, you know, their guys come to us for Jujitsu and our guys go down to them from me. So I'm definitely hoping once I, once I get some striking and shoot boxing to a certain level, I'd love to go down there, you know, like I said, it's just so I feel like, you know, almost they wouldn't know what to do with me at this point just because I'm just so, you know, base level right now.

Speaker 6:          01:02:10       Useless to go down. I don't want to waste their time. So you just turned the box from your train more time. I'm just boxing right now. My boxing coach told me that he thinks, you know, I used to spend about six months purely

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       unboxing before I jump into Moitai. Um, you could probably do it either way, but that's a good idea man. He kind of contrast the two things that they're trying to teach you. So focused on one thing first and then I'll jump into that for sure. Yeah. I get those mechanics down and then uh, the trans transition is very important though some people don't make it, don't make it, and the guy has leg kicks are just, they come into play, the elbows and knees come into play. There's too many things that come into play. Guys make the mistake of focusing primarily on boxing just because it feels good to punch somebody in the face. Pretty good at it. It's not an awkward movement for your body. Seems pretty self explanatory. Everybody understands it. But then kicking is this whole thing where you're moving your body in a way that seemed awkward and you're, you have to think about where you're and foot placement goes to some guys, they just become that boxer, a wrestler, Jujitsu type guy, but can't do that anymore, man.

Speaker 5:          01:03:12       It's just Vittori Belfort's we'll kicking you in the head. You know what I mean? It's like now it's on such a weird level that guys can do things. Guys that are like super high level and everything. They'll always have that advantage over you in this one thing. Like when your, as you're planning out your future, super important to look at all the spots. Some guys never do that, you know, like no one ever expects shale son and throw a head kick. You know what I mean? Like he's a good example of it. No one ever expected him to just never put that as a threat. It was never. But like a guy like a GSP or fill in the blank, they can kind of do anything. Perfect example. Mean you can do anything. Yeah, definitely makes you more dangerous for sure. If Jujitsu, like professional Jujitsu was a big thing.

Speaker 5:          01:03:56       It was on television, it was a major league sport tour we're trying to go. But would you go into mma or would you stay with you? It's an interesting question. I haven't really considered it yet because we just haven't gotten it to that level. Um, I think, I think I would still try it at some point to transition into May. Maybe I would hold it off for a little bit longer. Like if I really, if I really saw that the sport was taking off and I, you know, I felt like that's where I could make my headway and that's where I could make my mark. I definitely spend a lot more time there. I still think I would like to make a transition and a purely for so purely for, for a few reasons. One, just to test myself, I'm at a new thing to, um, to make sure that I have the knowledge for when, you know, somebody comes up to me and goes, oh yeah, I want to make a transition to mma from Jujitsu.

Speaker 5:          01:04:42       What's your advice? Well, I can't really give them advice if I've never done it before. I don't feel like, you know, so I want to really know what I'm talking about. If I'm talking to these guys, these young guys that want to come up and do something with an a instead of just Jujitsu. So I, I definitely, from a teaching perspective, I need to get into Nma and experience that and know what it's like. That's, that's how I feel anyway, regardless of whether or not Jujitsu takes off and it's on tv and all that stuff. Are you planning on ever doing any amateur boxing matches or anything along those wild? I got to talk to some of my coaches and stuff and see what they think is best in terms of, you know, my development and things like that. I would imagine that that probably, you know, would be good for sure.

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       Um, I, I want to avoid a as much as possible. I'm going the route of just getting knocked out all the time and training and stuff like that and just having that just gritty type of training where you're just, it's just getting you tough, you know, in quotation marks. And then I'll get to a point where I'm in a fight and I'm just getting touched on the Chin and knocked out. I want to make sure I'm focusing mostly on technical details and then putting it all together. So smart and so happy to hear you say that. So one of the most important things, you know Jamie Varner just did this interview recently, Jim Varner, who was a former WEC lightweight champion, really tough guy, did this interview recently. We said I shortened my career because I spar too hard as far too often our bigger guys, you started talking about I was sparring Ryan Bader and all these dudes are way bigger than him and that over those years of doing all that sparring with these larger guys and sporing really hard three days a week.

Speaker 5:          01:06:09       He's like, don't try to prove you're tough, you're tough, you're in the UFC. You really tough, like don't just try to do it right. And he said sometimes you don't even have to do with once a week, once every other week maybe even. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking in terms of like when I get to the sparring and stuff like that. For sure. I used to spar back in the day like probably like three, four years ago. Uh, when, uh, you know, some of my teammates is starting to do it some mma. I just did it for fun and for some experience and things like that, but it was, it was stupid and dangerous for me to be doing that without really knowing what I was doing in terms of striking. I think, you know, because all I was really doing, I mean all I was really doing was, you know, hitting until I could get to a take anyway.

Speaker 5:          01:06:45       But I mean just taking unnecessary damage for no reason from people that wanted to take my head off, you know, it's not smart and people think it's cute. They think it's fun. Like this guy doesn't even know how to box. Once we touch them up, get in there and throw hard hooks on your fucking head. You don't even see them coming and that, those, those shots that you take in those sparring sessions, they could really fuck you up now for a long time. The lad that had never really, you know, I didn't have to pay the price for that at all. If you could find guys that sparked technically really fast and have good control of man, you can progress so far. Yeah, because it takes away all the fear of getting hit. If you just find like it's just hard to find the ties apparently have a down.

Speaker 5:          01:07:23       I was talking with John Wayne par when he was on the podcast and he said they, they spar like they play, like when they're kicking each other though like slapping each other and because there's fighting every week so they don't want to get hurt. So when they're sparring they're like playing with each other. No one's trying to hurt anybody. It should always be like that and that's like the biggest problem for people starting out in training Jiu Jitsu to get that guy that's just squeezes everything and you need to be able to relax, get submitted and move around. Like you have to be comfortable and all that stuff. You know? It's like a hard thing for me to teach new people coming in and it's like the hardest transition. Get them to a point where they're comfortable enough to relax and then just let their mind open up to like what they should be doing now. Yeah. It seems like it's just time. It's the only thing that fixes that time and everything and striking to and you see guys that trained for a long time and maintain that mentality and still are just like you did just rough and tough guys that are trying as hard as they can,

Speaker 6:          01:08:16       every single role and they're not making a lot of progress. I see plenty of people like that so time but with good direction from like coaches and teammates and things like that because there's still plenty of guys that you could be training for 10 years and you're just still trained like a jerk off. So there's a lot of those guys that never really developed much, much offense either. They have like a couple of good moves that they look glad to. That's a weird thing. And then some people just figured out how to get like, how many years were you doing Jiu Jitsu will you started hitting like a real high level? Um, I mean I think, you know, I, I mean it was a, it was a progression. I was focused on like points Jujitsu for a long time. I was still trying to submit people, my strategy was I'm going to get to the back because there's a high score for points there and I could do a rear naked choke, said you highly effective submission and it's low risk, you know, so that was my strategy for everything.

Speaker 6:          01:09:06       So the first five years of my training was all dedicated to that from every position. Let's get to this guy's back, choke him from behind, keep this simple, I'm going to have more points and I'm going to be able to submit. The guy passed that. Those, these last three years I think I've made the biggest developments in terms of like broadening my submission base and learning how to submit people from different places and things like that. But I think it was kind of good for my progression, you know, because I got positionally sound in a bunch of different and had like a strategy and things like that. But it, it took till I was a black belt to really make advances. And in Jujitsu, I feel like, you know, high level, what do you, how do you feel about what submission only versus the points game?

Speaker 6:          01:09:44       Um, I mean, I think it, it takes a couple of different things, you know, like, so I mean you could see people that are possibly successful in both are successful in one or the other. Um, but I think what it comes down to is kind of the mentality of the person that's training or competing in either one of those things, you know, it's like you take somebody and whether they're appoints fighter, if there are points, spider competing in a submission only tournament, they're going to pretty much see them take the same strategy and the submission only toilet. Um, you know, it's, it takes, it takes guys that are constantly hunting for submissions in training. Um, and that's, that's when you're gonna see the best matches, you know, guys that are constantly hunting after submissions all the time. It's not just like a situational thing. There's like this, there's just this overarching thing that some of the bigger Jujitsu guys say.

Speaker 6:          01:10:30       I think I saw like an article from Kyle Taylor and I love dietary, you know, a great guy, but he posted this thing that said like, you know, Oh, you know, uh, you know, I, I hate when people talk about submission fighters and points fighters and, and you know, the difference between the two. And I think it's like the points fetters was, it's all the same, you know, and these guys talk about, Oh, I'm going to use my Jujitsu and if a submission opens up, I'm going to, I'll finish the guy if the submission opens up. No, you make the fucking submission open up. It's not, it's not like, oh, I'm waiting for this guy to like accidentally stick his arm out there. No, I make them, I take his arm away from him. That's the point, you know, uh, there's two complete. Those are two different mentalities, you know, I mean, oh, I'm going to wait for this guy to make a mistake and I'm going to make this guy in danger.

Speaker 6:          01:11:17       That's a newer mentality, right? Because the original mentality was like one of the reasons why I would favor a longer matches, you wanted to cook his opponent and want to slow them down, wanting to make them make mistakes, didn't have the physicality to impose himself on people. So he waited until they got tired and then they would give something up and it can work. Sure. And I don't think it's not a winning strategy. You can see clearly you see guys grind people out them. But I think that, I think that not just using strength, you can find ways to, you know, open up submissions on people. It's, it's, there's definitely a deeper level of technique there. Yeah. That's why the difference between the way Josh Barnett describes it, you know, describe submissions in the way, like some more technical jujitsu based guys would describe submissions. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:12:00       Like Barnett always calls like catch wrestling, like a violent art that elect your, your, your attack. It's not the gentle art to just use a general art catch wrestling, the violent art. So these, a lot of the young guys like yourself, super aggressive gods. There's like, there's like a change in philosophy then more adherent to that philosophy, like the aggressive go after it. Philosophy. Yeah, and I think when we're talking about taking grappling to a point where it's a spectator sport, which is what Eddie's trying to do in many of these other organizations, that's what needs to happen. Whether it's, whether it's going to help you win fights or not. Like you know, you take a look at the UFC and Dana White's always telling people like you have to have exciting fights, you have to have exciting fights and it's true because you won't have as many fans if you don't heal eventually kick you out of the UFC if you don't.

Speaker 6:          01:12:44       You know what I mean? But that's what makes it a Spec it. That's why people get paid to do it because people are excited to watch it and whether you win or lose, it can't be the only thing in your head. I'm at that point. If when we're talking about bringing people in, if you're making money, you're putting on a performance, you know, so it has to be about the attacks. It has to be about what's exciting about Jujitsu, the submission, you know what I mean? So people constantly getting attacked. That's what people want to see. And that's going to make this like a big thing that people are interested in. Are you still interested in competing in the GE or you're just doing. I'm also competing against. I just don't focus on it because nobody pays anybody to compete in the G. number one, let them.

Speaker 6:          01:13:19       Morris does. Yeah. Most and most of the matches don't ended the submission and they're considered boring matches the most of them. I'm not saying all dot matter. Metamora should go all Nogi what's, uh, yeah, I, I, I do. Um, I don't necessarily think that you can't have excited matches in the gate. I just think you have to find the right people. You have to find two people that are willing to put it all on the line and just try to submit each other and not give a shit whether or not they get submitted. It's hard. Even when you find people like that, when one, when they both have a grip of the color and the stuck there, they're really good at just holding each other. It's a, it's a tough one. Yeah. No, I agree. I think it just, it just makes it more exciting, more smashing the game.

Speaker 6:          01:14:01       Uh, I, I'd consider it, but it would take out a bigger camp, you know? Uh, I definitely, uh, I'm definitely just focused on Nogi right now for everything in my future. It's just like you, if I'm going to do MNA, it only makes sense. Um, every match, every super fight that I'm being asked to do is without the gate. It just literally at this point makes no sense for me to spend a lot of time on it. Now, once again, like I said before, from an instructional standpoint, your students that might be interested in training and the gate at some point. Once I break away from, you know, my athletic career, I'll definitely study the geo. Definitely studied judo, definitely study all the things that, those little intricacies that people use in Jujitsu, the lapel guards and things like that. So that I can better help my students, but not so much for me as a professional athlete.

Speaker 6:          01:14:42       I don't think. I think at this point we're hitting a point in Jujitsu where you have to make a decision. What am I going to specialize in? And uh, I think I'm going to specialize in Nogi submission, grappling with Marcello. I've never rolled with Marcello recently. He's been, uh, you know, he's been injured. I think he's coming back now pretty strong from what happened to him. He got his knee hurt doing something. I'm not a hundred percent sure what, maybe snowboarding. Yeah, exactly. Perfect. Perfect. He loves really. It's awesome dude. Once you will, eventually you'll, you'll, you'll do it. I've been skiing. It's, it's different when you're going sideways. Was it different? It's first of all to better. It's, it's, uh, it's better really. Once you go snowboarding for years, you don't go back. For years I was snowboarding like when I was like back to guy was like, I was skiing for losers on the snowboard.

Speaker 6:          01:15:35       Snowboard is so much cooler. So I do it for like four or five years, just like, you know, once a year, twice a year, you know, family would go on trips or whatever. And then one year my friends like, dude, you gotta try out scheme, you know, see how you see how you. Like now at snowboarding I was at a level, this is my strategy snowboarding as fast as I possibly fucking could in a straight line going down the hill and then fall to stop myself. Alright. Sounds like getting almost knocked out, you know, falling into the snow. How fast are you going? I have no idea. Who knows? And I'm only going like, you know, bunny slopes or like, you know, blue, whatever, the blue squares, intermediate, whatever I could never do. I was fearful of a black black diamonds straight down I saw put on skis.

Speaker 6:          01:16:15       I put on skis the first time I try it. Black diamond, no problem. You know what I mean? It's like it, it's, I mean clearly you're not doing it technically, but like it's safe. You know what I mean? I could, I felt like comfortable, like at slow myself down snowboarding. I just feel like you're looking in one direction. It's just tunnel vision. You're going as fast as you can. It's so. It's so much more. Uncontrolled is difficult. So what you're saying is snowboarding is more exciting. I think there for a thrill seeking point of view. Hell yeah. It feels more dangerous to me. You're locked into this board. You don't have your two legs to be able to separate and balance there. So often the snowboarders collide with each other if you're going that fast. When I'm on the slopes is the high much higher percentage than everybody else, but you just got to learn to turn inside because really snowboarding and skiing is just the art of slowing down, brake, brake, brake and slowing down and slowing down. Slowing down because as soon as you don't slow down, boom, you go down like a Ronnie Bono.

Speaker 3:          01:17:13       Oh, back to Marcello. He. What would he be? Someone that I think personally has a Jujitsu fan you against Marsala would be the most interesting. Like if that was metamorris yeah, Jesus. I would never superfight Ebi. Yeah, we'd never call them out or anything. You just don't have any right to, but I'm not going to be an amazing match. I love that matchup. I'm rematch with chrome. Absolutely. I asked for it all the time, but again, I can't really call crone out. He beat me so I, you know, I called them out in a sense like, hey, I want to fight you, but I would never talk shit about chrome to try and get them to fight me because it's just not. That's not fair. Like what do you mean

Speaker 1:          01:17:45       made that match was the finish that made that match and it made the match for both of you. It's, it's like it made the match so much more exciting than if you guys just went to a draw. If you went to a stalemate at the end and maybe you know, you were both clenched up with each other and it ended, that would've not been as good with. That was a perfect example of what's possible at high level Jujitsu. So exciting.

Speaker 3:          01:18:06       The fact that he did submit, you blew up. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:18:11       You put him in some terrible positions, man. I mean you, you had him in some bad spots. We were like, Holy Shit. And you know, Eddie and I went off about it. We watched the video. We was there alive. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:18:23       that's right. I was like, we were all crying. Oh, is he gonna beat crone. Oh, and then one minute left, it was chrome. They broke you guys up. He looked at Hixson. Does a video of you explaining

Speaker 1:          01:18:36       Gary and then we play the video of the fight on the Internet. It's on youtube. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So it's, it's cool that like, something like that exists and I just think that we need to have more of those out there. And then eventually Hollywood people are going to go, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. What is. This is wild shit. Hold on. Nobody. Nobody has this locked down. This isn't on television for the UFC has established a very firm like huge property in the UFC. Like that's what everybody connects with mma. MMA equals UFC and if you're fighting for Bella tour, they go, oh wow. So you're going to be fight for the UFC someday. Like it just what it is. There's none of that with grappling. It doesn't exist. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:19:14       How many times have you heard a guy trying to? 2,000, 2000. One, 2000. Two guys that were already deeply into the UFC was we saw a 93. It's 2000, 2001. Even to this day. You run into guys that aren't into it and they've seen it a couple times. Just a couple dudes rolling around. I was like, uneventful for them. For them it was uneventful, but when we saw it, what did we see? What was the difference? The difference was the fucking tournament. The first one I saw was UFC two and that was $60 tournament because it ends up being. When you see one match at a time, it's like a documentary. You see maybe that first round you don't, you don't know one looks familiar, but that second round you're like, oh shit, that dude with the long hair against. That's the Ninja Dude. And then the semifinals, or you're like, Holy Shit, how's that?

Speaker 3:          01:20:01       Gonna work out. You just saw their career that night and then the finals, holy Saint, Patrick Smith. You're like, Holy Shit. I went from hating hoists in the opening round because he beat my karate guys, rooting for him and just being as follower right there at that final, because I. Pat Smith was kind of a, you know, he was like a heel even within that. So it was a movie. That's why we got to work with the people that watch it back then got obsessed with it instantly. It was the greatest thing ever. If they would have been single matches and you didn't know those dudes, it would probably would. We wouldn't have that drama unfold. There's just be a bunch of single matches so you can't. Exactly. And you can't do that with mma, but you can totally do that. Would you did too. And that's why Abu Dhabi is so special because it's a bunch of 16 man brackets supervised, but the only thing that I think Abu Dhabi should have a $60 bracket habit, like four days, like a whole week.

Speaker 3:          01:20:55       What? Every day is a different one because the way they do it now it's like it's like watching three movies at the same time. You're not watching it unfold and then on the Internet you just watch a link of the finals and then you go back and watch a semifinal. You don't. It's like watching a movie in pieces and you already know the ending, but what what metamorris does is have a single fight. Every fight is his main stage. There's three matches or 12 matches, like the moon deals. It's one match at a time showcase, but it's not a tournament style. So. So what I'm trying to do is I took the best from Abu Dhabi and the best from metamorris and try to combine it metamorris submission only one match out of time. And Abu Dhabi, the super 16 man brackets that are in themselves, if you watch it one by one, one at a time center stage, it's mindblowing.

Speaker 3:          01:21:43       When you watch it like that, we need to watch it like that. In my opinion. That's what made Ebi Ebi too, which I mean Gary went and submitted everybody in that 16 man bracket. Every dude he ran through and in the final, by the time we got to the final with him and Richie, Richie blew through everybody on his end of the bracket, so it was Richie and Gary. The. Everyone was going nuts because they saw it unfold one at a time. That's the secret, right? That's a very good point. You know, they're trying to do that with glory and I am actually. I've been advising people against it. I think it's a terrible idea for kickboxing and too much data, too much damage. People going to get hurt for cut. It's not going to want to get Kayo. That's the problem you get sometimes you get killed and you still fighting when you know you get, you get knocked out and you're still fighting on autopilot and then it's over like what happened?

Speaker 3:          01:22:29       You want, you want a decision like what I've seen that happen with guys, it's not say Gloria, they fought three times. They had the last man standing tournament in La. We went to that right. You can do that, that should. They fought three fucking times, man box and the first fight Joe Schilling had to fight for rounds because the third after the third round was a draw. That's how powerful tournament's on when you watch it, it's so powerful that you might not be able to do on kickboxing is all this shit could go wrong. It's root, it's risky, but the tournament is so exciting that if we could pull this off and no one gets hurt and we get lucky, it's a grand show that people are going to watch over and and when you watch it from the beginning to end, you feel it. It's a documentary.

Speaker 3:          01:23:10       That's a very good point though. That's a very good point and I think if someone got ahold of that, someone who produces sports television and realize that this is like an unsung property like this is out there. The sport is at a very high level right now. Guys are very, very exciting and no one has capitalized on it. No one's put it on television and no one's making money with it, but they just don't know. They just don't know how to do it for. First of all, you got to get rid of the points. Know I put together Ebi, like if some old Jewish guy who owned some network said, I don't know about this martial art stuff, but I like your kid. I'm going to give you one season. I don't know about no Jujitsu or anything. I'm going to give you one season.

Speaker 3:          01:23:44       As soon as the ratings drop, it's out. We got a deal. Then you would go, oh shit, okay. We got to get rid of the fucking game we got. We got to get rid of the points and we got to have a tournament. You've got to see it unfold because that's what makes the ultimate fighter so awesome. It's at the tournament, although it doesn't happen in one day, but it's still a tournament. You see the brackets unfolding just like the march madness. I hate basketball, but I understand why there's tournaments. You see it all unfolding. You see the drama, you know, and, and that is what's missing from grappling. That's why, in my opinion, that's why you can't get it on tv because in all the other formats, it's just too much stalling, too much holding. We need right now to dispute your claims because right now you're talking crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:24:28       Disrespectful, so about biggie. There is no live. Let no let go. Let go. I think that's one of his quotes. There's nothing funnier than Brazilian misinterpretations of English. I said Eddie, a picture of a tee shirt that I've found in my closet way back in the day of Waleed Ish. My leg t shirt. Yeah. What the fuck did it say on it? It said on the back there's a cartoon picture. Him being always on me and he's like, he's actually the nicest, sweetest guy in the sky. All those mean looks. It's all him doing pro wrestling. He's actually super sweet, Super Nice. He'll take a picture and then he'll be like a little kid. He'll look at his picture. A classic one back in late, 2004, 2003. I love that dude. He has a shirt where it's him standing there like in a cartoon character and it says on the top, don't be coward.

Speaker 3:          01:25:28       Don't run from them. Don't run off the fight. Yes, don't be coward. Don't run off the fight. Can you imagine? Imagine what a. When he turned in, like when he went to the t shirt shop place, there's an American guy. It was like, this is bullshit. Put it now. Now I can. Okay, we're going to need some initials on this right now. Initial right there and right there. It was crazy. Let's just use the damn shirt. I'm trying to find a printing it. We're like, boss, boss, come here. I just want to make sure it says don't run off

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       the fine. We'll call it that. I'm trying to be coward and he's just like, I just want your approval here and initial here and I see he didn't tattoo it on himself. I want to get this out of the way. Now you Mr. Smile, you realize what you have written here and this is exactly how you would like print it. It goes to court. You know what I mean? To do a selfie video that I'm trying to find the picture I know and claims that they fucked up. Yeah. This is not the true Jujitsu. I never say run off. Run off the stupid. Doesn't even make sense. Yeah. He was a. That was a crazy match with him and hoists. Remember that shit on the beach in Rio. They fought like with Matt, so were laid out in the sand. Everybody got sand in their eyes and their face.

Speaker 2:          01:26:54       There's fucking sand everywhere. They slapped him some mats down on the bed. She always had big balls to take that because while lead was fucking everyone up back then and while lead he got him in a clock choke, put them to sleep. That's right. That's a weird thing to watch too. I can't believe they let him take that bike. Is Jen the general consensus in like late like after the UFC around like how good is hoist Jujitsu for real and he was never like a world champion or a national champion or anything like that. Everybody knew that. Everyone knew his. He had decent Jujitsu. He wasn't lighting the world on fire. So for him to take a vow that volleyball match man that showed he had gigantic balls because volleyed was a destroyer. Yeah. That's a hugely ballsy move. And you know, he got choked asleep, which I think was very important for Jujitsu just to show like you.

Speaker 2:          01:27:43       Everyone looked at hoists. Gracie, rightly so as this massive innovator, this, this pioneer of Jujitsu and mma I heroes was after the UFC gets choked out. Yeah. Yeah. He's a hero of Jujitsu and then you go, okay, well listen, there's guys out there that are another level, another level above him, you know, and this is one of them. Well that's what he said about Hicks. And he said, well, I'm not actually that good Hickson's 10 times better than me. And then the Japanese went, oh, okay. You sure? Okay. Do you have his number? I found that it's not a cartoon cartoon. I found it. It's actually a picture of him. I thought it was a cartoon, but we had more than one eddie. There was more than one. No, no, no. This is the front. The back. You need the back of the bag of it as a card. Okay. Let me see. No mercy, no rules, no pain. This is a different one then man. This is the one that things don't go together. I have the same shirt on the back. One hundred percent. I haven't him. He's in. He's in cartoon form two and the bad. All yoked and shit. There was definitely more than one of those ridiculous shirts though, but that's why a those is so funny because you know, if you think that he's actually being conservative and not those kind of conservative with his language. He's a. he's not a stick man. He's a real motherfucker schick shtick

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       as the stick. I say no, no, no. Stick. It's like his act out a lot. He's actually that cocky in real life. People think amazing. It's super confident guy. No, he really is like that. Would you be willing to match him with the game? Because the game is his strong suit. I wouldn't. I never said anything bad about him and he's always been nice to me. Fuck it. No comment. He's scared the videos when Nate Diaz is taking it serious? Yeah. Yeah. Oh my God. Fuck man. The first time I met him it was a joke either. Not a joke. He's, he's really that arrogant. It everyone thinks he's just pretending to be arrogant. He was doing, she was doing. I'm showing my respect because his passport has specked. So you said, you said that someone was thinking about trying to turn submission grappling into a television show, like who's trying to do it?

Speaker 1:          01:29:58       Oh No, no, no. I was just saying that people were trying to be trying to be like the UFC and the way that you were talking about how somebody be fighting in Beltour. It's like, Oh yeah, when are you going to be in UFC? People are trying to do that. Um, I've had multiple organizations now asked me to be exclusive to their organization for competing. Yup. Yup. So much. No, sounds terrible. If they pay enough cash or enough money. I don't know about all that. Man. I, I'm, I'm in favor of. Look, the big issue with with the MMA is in the big issue with boxing has always been that trying to get the best guys to be able to fight the best guys when you're exclusive for one promoter, exclusive for another promoter and it makes things super problematic. Independent contracts for independent matches and no longterm commitment to things is the smart way to go for grapplers because if that gets established as the Goto, then it favors the grappa and then there's no advantage that the promoter has over the grappa.

Speaker 1:          01:30:57       The grappa could always find another promoter, so if the, if the. If the promoters get along with the grapplers and everybody agrees with how much money everybody's making and it seems cool and fair, then that would be a good way to do it. You know, so no one has a lockdown on the market. I think that's very important. They're trying to adjust me to turn down the offer. Yeah, yeah. I did. Good for you, man. Good for you. That takes balls and that's a smart thing to do because I think if, if everybody's just set that precedent and we created this market where the grapplers where the star, like this is what's important. If people want to see, you know, fill in the blank, Marcella Garcia versus Gary tone of people want to see that match. The real benefit is of that match. The benefactors of that mass should be Marcella Garcia and Gary Tonin. And then of course some money should go to the promoter. You know, some money should, but it's what's the only thing that's exciting about submission grappling is the submission grapplers. That's it. Yep. Because if you're not selling that, you're selling air. Yep. That's it. That's all you got. So if you're locked up to one organization, it's also limits. Matches,

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       matches. You can't make it can only do a certain number of matches per year. Right? So what, what organization puts on 12 matches a year right now is the same guy every, every match. What do you say? I'm sure that the promoter, whoever's doing this, I have no idea. I'm sure he's probably saying to themselves, Hey, if we want to be as big as the UFC, UFC type stuff. Exactly, and it's just such a flawed mentality. I feel like for the sport doesn't have to be so young and it's so tiny and there's very little money. Every single one of these organizations, these professional organizations, Ebi, Metamorris, Polaris, all these things that are popping up here and there. They're all doing amazing things for the sport. They're broadening the audience for submission grappling. It's so silly to think that you need to be just the guy. Everybody is cross promoting each other.

Speaker 5:          01:32:49       I like when my guys fight Metamorris, right? They're going to fight. It helped me personally. My guys, Gio Boogie, Nathan Orchard, my guys, I try to get them on metamorris carts, texted hallock go, dude, how could you not want ge or is on your fucking show? He just blew through everybody in the Abu Dhabi trials all within two minutes to get everybody. One Eva one as a featherweight one is a bad way. Finished everybody. How do you not want that guy to go there? You're dealing with a rational individual. That's the problem. Well, the people that are doing Jujitsu, the people that are involved in Jujitsu, if you're involved in these matches, if you're involved in competition, most likely 99 percent of the time you're making your money off of teaching. Right? Most of the people that are running these schools, that's where they're making their money, so it's not like a situation where there's this giant piece of pie that everybody's battling over, so everybody wants dominance.

Speaker 5:          01:33:43       It's like it's beneficial for you to get your students into metamorris because then they could highlight how good of a teacher you are. Good for everybody. That's good. It's good for Metamorris. It's good for Ebi when he comes back, because will never be exclusive. He's always going to be an Abi. Oh wait. Yep. And so why would I want to keep them from metamorris and back and forth? I'd tell her, I'd tell her, look, let's let's work together and use. Let's let me blow up the guys and then ship them off to you. I love Metamora, but he makes the most money that way. And then we come back, we, we bring them back over to Ebi. I think this is the new way of thinking. I think this, this kind of exists in everything exists in martial arts were martial arts today. Like here's a perfect example of Jujitsu.

Speaker 5:          01:34:27       Guys are constantly trading techniques to each other, constantly showing each other things. The whole thing about martial arts in the old days, like in the sixties, in the seventies, was how secret it was. They had secret techniques and they would hide from you the seeing. You couldn't teach white people member brutally got in trouble for teaching white people. Same thing with Mexicans. Either you couldn't teach western, couldn't teach Americans you, you know, they wanted to keep it within the Chinese culture. Now it's the total opposite. Now everybody's exchanging and everybody's just trying to find out what's the best shit. Who's the best at this?

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       And you get guys together and you match them up with each other. I mean, that's essentially the new thinking and new thinking for everything. And the fact that this is how it is right now so far with Jujitsu, with professional submission grappling is awesome. That means it has a shot. But as soon as someone comes along and buys the whole thing and then wants to put on only, like you said, 12 matches a year, like you compete, how often do you compete in as once or twice. Once to. Twice a month. Yeah. That's insane. And that's one of the reasons why you're so good. You're not just training all the time, you're throwing yourself into battle all the time. You know, I've seen quite a few of your, your matches online and I saw the recent one where you, uh, what's the guy's name? The leg locks specialists. The MMA guy I've seen held. He's really good, man. Yeah. That was a really, really interesting fight. It was really cool to watch. He was probably one of the most game people that showed up to that show. Like he was prepared. I felt it. I could see it, you know, like man, that was a, that was, he was there. He showed up for that Mesh for MMA. His jujitsu technique is stellar.

Speaker 3:          01:35:59       Yeah. You talk about leg locks at work, at mma and leg lockers that are having success. Your number one guy a man back in the day when he used to go for leg locks a lot. Now he really doesn't. He's still awesome. Uh, and then you say, oh, that's right Marci Mel, because he'll pull guard just like some art right into. He'll hook up your, the performance that, that, uh, really impressed me. There's a, there are two performances and metamorris man, when you went against kit bail and you just, you didn't even leg lock. And he guillotine. That setup was so beautiful. That's a crazy setup.

Speaker 1:          01:36:36       Your arm was in a such a weird position when you were, when you guys were trying to scramble. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:36:40       yeah. And in Metamorris, the whole metamorris is in a constant struggle with how do we put together exciting fights. That's what it's all about it. So there's a show comes out, everyone on the internet goes boring, boring. Oh, this one was great. Are born. It's always like. So if you have a boring match, people on the Internet are gonna fucking flame. You. That's when everybody was mad at Brendan Shot. Yeah, exactly. And, and, uh, maybe the last I like them whether they're boring or not. I liked the whole atmosphere. I liked going to metamorris and hanging out. I fucking love it. It's a high level. There's a lot of money behind it. Um, I wish I had that kind of money behind Abi then it would be on like donkey Kong, but it's beautiful. It's beautiful. I love metal. I love even when some matches are boring, I love it because then I talked to the guy next to me, you know what? I'm just trying to watch a match.

Speaker 3:          01:37:36       Nachos. They're outstanding. You know, the boring matches when the key matches. Come on dude, look around. Everybody is on facebook and on Instagram, on boring young. Everybody is like communicating right during the match. It's, it's incredible. But, but, but I'm in the middle of all that. No one can say he just saving shell after Shell because his matches. He goes out and just finishes. I'm boring show except for Gary. Gary tone and with two RS and a Kit Dale, so you could find that. And then that does. He does maxwell match. You know dude, man, you just, you without you right now man. Without you metamorris would be Ooh, you're keeping a metamorris afloat because they're just boring. Match after boring match. Again. I love Jujitsu. I understand boring matches. I think you've got to get. I told her like don't. He doesn't want to go pure and Augie because he feels like it's disrespectful to assist the spirit of Jujitsu and shit.

Speaker 3:          01:38:36       I told him, I told him I go do what Abu Dhabi does util will make the decision. Let the fighters make the decision. And so you could wear anything you want. And you know what? When they have that decision, knowing where shit. All the guys that love the GE, they take it the fuck off. That's how I. But the hobby is I would be. You could worry can you can at Quito pants. You can wear anything. You want the shit dude, come on. Come in with some. At the top would be the one that you were at. There was this Japanese fighter in a blue superman outfit. Remember that guy? People loved him, but he showed up like several costumes. It's like Spiderman. Superman is if you do that, if you do that, the promoter, he is off the hook. Say, I want it to be.

Speaker 3:          01:39:14       I want them to wear whatever they want. You know what? Nobody would work. I think it comes down to what Joe said, a huge events for the guy. They have all these handles and weapons. You'd be wearing the weapon around your neck and dude, go straight. Marco, who was straight fucking those bikini briefs. They were in Paris in pride, in pride. You could have all Jitsu guys go to pride. The only one who's wearing a [inaudible] Yoshida noise and he wasn't even Jujitsu, but all the other Brazilians, they're wearing those bikini's that they were on the beach. They're shaving their legs. The greasy, the greener. Mccoys took the g off. Remember? Boy started wearing the g pants when he fought Aki Bono. G Pants top. Yup. And here it is in Metamorris. Hallock. Please don't sue us for this. We're trying to pop up metamorris no need to get crazy and this.

Speaker 3:          01:40:01       This is the match that made kid dale lift weights. I follow instagram. Oh Dude, he was. He was jacked during that. Everybody kept telling me how much I rather than it going to be wrong. No were wrong. He was very big, but now he's giant and you've seen the pictures of him on his instagram. Holy Shit. That guy's swole. The fuck up now. You made them lift weights. If you look at his instagram, you look at it is why are you looking? You're looking at funding. Someone said something stupid. What's APP when they're introducing you? Because they can call me a five time Nogi world champion, which is not true. So views that. Chris, whose idea was that together? I don't know man. Chris Howard is old school, black belt man, old school Machado. Linear. She's been around a long time. That's cool to see that. He's refereeing this.

Speaker 6:          01:40:54       Yeah. Our. Our video sucks. If Fat Dick Today. Dude, I love that role. And unguided do the cut to a photo. Little skyline. Fuck. Is that WHO's running? Who's running the operating board? So you pull half guard here immediately. Tisdale's on top of you. And what do you, uh, you try and establish here when you're doing this, what's your go to shit. It's Camorra's from here or I'm probably trying to come underneath them for a leg lock. Um, so. So you play in it light here. We'll relaxed. No one's gone crazy yet. You guys got a long match, right? It's like a 20 minute match. So when you have a match like this, are you a, are you really consciously like budgeting your time and your energy a little bit? I use you, you use your energy efficiently. When I, I'll feel I'll use my energy when I feel like it's a, it's going to help me attack, you know what I mean? I'm not going to use energy just to push and pull, you know, if I'm going to, I'm going to use it to make sure I'm not in danger to make sure my opponents. So now you're going after his leg. Damn beautiful. Jamie. And then you'd have to look at this point wasn't very good. Um, you know, my form there is a little off to nasty transition. There's definitely some things that I could've done a hell of a man that looks, that looks terrifying. And he's rolling here? Yes. Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:42:12       Dale gets out. How dare he, you could tell it looked like you were at everything. Go right back to this as your go to shit. Huh? Outside he'll hook. You need to be perfect for them to work, man. It's just so much detail. But uh, yeah man and back in half. And then some camera work. Metamorris save on lights. They go back to kids with every good passer. Very good. He actually showed up to my job right before this. Yeah, I heard he was training with you guys and coincidentally did we were working on your site. So then coincidentally it wasn't trying to, that's what he was saying. He was saying, Oh yeah, they're trying to get. That's all we were doing for a while and he showed up and he's fighting gary toning and I'm like, I'm not going to change my, my, I gotta show this to my students.

Speaker 6:          01:42:58       So I apologize for that. No, it's all good, man. It was not on purpose. It was not on purpose. I've never met him. He just showed up to my gym. Really Nice Guy. Cool Dude. I ended up falling on instagram and all that stuff, but yeah, he's a funny dude. I'm sure. Kindergarten stuff compared to what you guys know what I'm agenda so that the computer fucking up. Yeah. So we get back out to the feet and then me, I drilled this with my wrestling coach for, you know, we do this all the time. He's still drilling. I'm just establishing the under hook from collar ties and hitting a good snap down from here to get a good snap down and get control of the head now and then I just follow it and now my hands aren't connected yet. Right. And then I'm trying to connect my hands finally get it. And once the hands get connected he tries to struggle out a couple more times and finally sinks in deep. I can't believe we can't see this j we've got to deal with that today. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       This is annoying. Is the one time where it'd be really nice to have video. I can get Zach to help you, Jamie, and yeah, we can do whatever you got to take care of that. Can you play it at all? Or. We done stuff on mad right at the sweet spot. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:44:11       No,

Speaker 3:          01:44:14       what's happening Jamie? There it is. There it goes and he already tapped. Perfect. Okay. Back it up a little bit then. So this is the part where you don't have your hands connected. Yeah, because it does have your arm. He ducked hard so that my hands were separated and then I connect him. Finally get that crunching on the neck. Then you got it from half guard here. Huh? Are Men or Marcella team? Uh, it's uh, you know, it's high elbow Gulati and you catch this from half guard all the time. Um, yeah. Yeah. Well I don't set it up from half guard but I ended up in half guard for the finish for sure. And then we come up a little bit. We reset it. Boom. Wow. You got a full mouth Marcella, or you guys call it high elbow. High Elbow. But yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:44:54       I mean, Marcella uses it. Yeah. No, finished in full garb with his arm trapped. His arm was trapped. His was his left arm trapped. Uh, I didn't see. I didn't see that. I'd have to watch it again. I don't know if I intentionally trapped it, but damn, that guillotine right there, man. That was huge one seeing Marcello hit it all the time. The only reason I called it Marcella teen, I didn't know it was called high high elbow Gilot time. Sure. That was a name. But I just stuck with Marcella teen so that in, in the 10th planet system, every time that comes up and it's so crucial, it's a part of our warm ups that I want Marcello to make sure he gets credit because sure, no one's had more success with it than anybody I would say because of that success. He's probably the best at it.

Speaker 3:          01:45:36       No, I've seen him run through black belts. Uh, I've seen her run through a high level black belt 10 times in 10 minutes. What's the same? The same guillotine technique, man. John was preaching to me to get good at that technique for so long and like I sucked at it for forever. It takes a long time. How will you connecting your hands? Uh, I just grab. So when I grabbed like mid, mid. Should I go down past the pinky inbetween the risks and the, and the pinky bone and then grabbed my left hand over the right hand, grab my hand. I know I've hit some on the left side and competition. I've gone the opposite direction. But um, in terms of like if I'm finishing on the right side. Yeah. Left hand over. Right. So I've seen people hit it, hit it like this. I've seen people do it with 10 finger grips.

Speaker 3:          01:46:14       Yup. Yup. The difference between those, what Marcella told me is this feels so much easier for me, but what Marcella says, and uh, Danny does it this way too, but marcel, we went over it. He said he doesn't like this as opposed to this because the guard underneath is going to come up and reach and grab. And if he gets in between these two hands here, his fingers are going to come up, he can wreck the grip. You got to be the grip. But if he comes up here and I come this way, it doesn't matter if he grabs the inside. That's how most people think they're doing right thing. They're gone

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       and I still get choked. They're gonna still get choked because he's coming around it instead of here. So that makes sense. It makes a lot of sense. There's a bunch of different. We're talking about people don't know if you're listening to, especially. There's a bunch of different ways to hold your hands with different submissions. And that's one of the interesting things about Jujitsu is that there's little tweaks that you'll learn a little turns and twists. Like Einstein always likes to call it freedom rock. You know that one team where like, you know, you ever seen that commercial for freedom rock. It's like ridiculous. A commercial for one of those compilation records that you would buy when you turn it up, man. So like the turning it up, freedom rock, like the turning your, your, your hand to the side and forcing the blade of your wrist.

Speaker 1:          01:47:35       And this one's named, he named me basically named the squeeze of the dark. There wasn't a name for what you're technically doing, you know? Uh, so he named it and it's a good name. It's a great name. It's freedom rock. Just to remind you that it's just, it's not just figure four on your arms, you got to turn it in and squeeze. So it's a smart thing. It is a smart thing and it's cool that there's those little technical things about Jujitsu and for, for people that get involved in it and start realizing like from the outside, you look at one way and then you get involved in it and you start seeing all the depth to it. That's where all the Jujitsu nerds come into place because that's what it does. It seem. It doesn't seem to jive like people like, well how come these really computer oriented, nerdy kind of dudes are so in love with Jujitsu?

Speaker 1:          01:48:17       Well, you know, like Donna, her always talks about there's a video that we were talking about earlier that they playing on the underground with him talking about it being high level problem, problem solving under stress, and that's what's exciting about people who are, maybe they would be into video games or maybe they'd be into chats or maybe they'd be into all sorts of problem solving type things, but you get doing it in real time. The rush of success is so much better. Like the rush of winning a chess match, I'm sure is great, but do you think it is good as you choking kit dale out of here, get the fuck out of here. There's no way. It's not even possible. You know, that rush is the ultimate rush. That's the, you're dead rush. This is not a like a Bang Bang. You're dead in a virtual sense when you're wake character.

Speaker 1:          01:49:01       This is like you're playing death. Somebody overlaid some of your podcasts, uh, over some like Jujitsu video, uh, some real about you talking about submissions and like what submissions really are, what a tap really is. And you're like, oh yeah, that's I just possibly killed you right there. Yeah. You're killing dudes. You killed. Killed Kennedy mean perfect. Perfect. It's also beautiful for people that are practicing it that you could kill a guy like that and look, he's fine afterwards. You're holding his hand up. He's fine. Means neck was sore the next day, but other than that he's fine. He didn't get knocked out. He didn't get beat up. So it's almost like a more ethical form of combat entertainment. If somebody was going to put it on, somebody decided to put the Ebi on spike tv or something like that. It's like, you know, everybody has a problem with, with head trauma.

Speaker 1:          01:49:46       Like that fucking kid that just died. A boxer just died the other day of trauma. It's going to happen no matter what if you have combat sports. But in Jujitsu it's way, way, way, way, way, way, way safer. Yeah, absolutely safe for longterm for the participants. And you could still like you watched that match, man, that's exciting. Shit. I dare anybody who knows nothing about Jujitsu, just watch Gary Thompson versus Kit Dale and watch it with an open mind and watch those transitions that you're going through and you realize like, Whoa, this is a. they're doing a crazy thing here. They're like, they're like Helson Gracie. I had Steve Maxwell and the podcast the other day and Helson Gracie. Somebody asked him to describe Jujitsu and I guess his English is not the best in the world and he's got a little bit of an accent. He goes, this is Jujutsu.

Speaker 1:          01:50:33       You do this. Then I do that. Then you do this. Then I do that forever. Isn't that the dopest fucking answer me? That is kind of what it is in a way until one of us almost dies or keep it until you can't keep it up anymore, and then that guy beats you. The super hyper way of killing someone and breaking their limbs. John dammit her. Remember we hung out with them that one night he said, if you, if you look at it, a striking is the least intelligent way of taking someone out, grappling that's the most intelligent way. Striking is the most caveman way of fighting, just keep hitting each other's heads over and over until someone goes down when grappling is like, let me take this guy down and scientifically put them, put them to sleep and get the hell out of that is true, but in a situation where you can't grapple with someone, like if you're in a street fight, would you want to be in a street fight with Marcella Garcia in a bar or would you want to be in the street fight with John Wayne.

Speaker 1:          01:51:35       John Wayne Park is going to be head kick and motherfuckers and putting people in the hospital with elbows to the face like you tried to get close to that dude. You're going to get your head smashed in. John always talks about striking eyes, like inability to do crazy amounts of damage in such a short period of time. So there's clearly pluses and minuses to both in real life situations. Absolutely. You don't want to just go to the ground striking skills. I wish I was a kickboxer. It would be nice to be able to have the confidence to throw, you know, you could take three dudes out if you're striking move. If you time it perfectly, you can take three dudes out for those who don't know and they fuck with Melvin manhoef in a bar. First guys asleep dead. There's two guys left. One guy runs says fuck that, and then it's one on one and that guy's dead. He's dead. He's dead. Badr, Hari Badr, Hari. Apparently they, one of the reasons why he was from jail more than once, I think beating the fuck out of people. One of the reasons why he's in jail. They took this guy's leg and they stomped it and snapped his Shin in half and this guy is fucked the wrong dude to fuck with, you know, in a, in a street confrontation. So I see both sides. You know, it's, it's good to. You can get like super

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       high level and striking. It is intelligent. It's more intelligent than wrestling with somebody. You know, if you're in a bar and a bunch of other people around and you're in a melee type situation, if you can be a John Donner, her, you know, look, you could, you could protect yourself for sure. You know, John is an excellent blackbelt. Anybody that goes one on one with them is just going to get mangled. Some untrained person doesn't know any better, but I'll, I'll be willing to bet that even multiple people that have tried to attack John had some trouble as a bouncer. Absolutely many years of his life. He's had to deal with a lot of that. So he would use you as a shield. Oh, start using your arms to beat other people senseless with. But the point being is not unintelligent to have a John Wayne par skillset and there's, there's definitely an intelligent way to use striking obviously Badr Hari or hey, I didn't say that. I was just throwing her under the bus.

Speaker 2:          01:53:39       Why do you feel like we're doing all the time and just completely misconstruing everything he's ever said to us. Just ruining all of it. There's no either or. Because. Because there's a lot of intelligence and there's a lot of technique to high level striking if you watch like those Lawrence Kenshin breakdowns or the Jack Slack breakdowns on the under underground. He goes over like the real technical process of why like bluecat or you know, a yachtsman Cli on the really high level Thai guys. Why they're so good. There's a lot of shit going on. It just looks like they're smashing each other with their bones. But nope. How one guy keeps getting smashed and the other guy does all the smashing like this. And I know, I know guys that are dummies, shit and amazing Jujitsu. So, you know, I know some really super strong and the same either currently.

Speaker 2:          01:54:32       Um, I'm, I'm excited about Jujitsu right now. I think there's like one of the best times for whatever because of all the, the, the, like people talking about it on the Internet and all these online communities that have formed, it seems to me electric Jitsu has a lot of enthusiasm behind it right now. The gracie nationals and gracie world, they proved rose gracie prove that you can do submission only because before that it was submission only. What a submission only matched with like a a dream, like a fantasy. What if, what if gracie nationals, gracie world's made it work and then metamorris did the whole prestigious single match, you know, UFC type event. And what do you think Abu Dhabi should do? Because that's where all the money, right? That guy has more money than anybody on the planet should do. Submission only Ebi rules. Not because I made it up as I personally think I'm constantly changed like the overtime I'm tweaking it. I'm trying to make it so that someone says, well what about if a dude does this? And overtime like, Oh shit, we got to change. I was having. I had a long conversation with John Banner about a month ago about the overtime. What do we do right here? I'm old. I'm not going to be one of those guys. It's going to see a glaring problem. I'm going to do what the Japanese do. Someone presents a problem. They go, Oh shit,

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       let's make it better. I'm going to switch it. So, um, anyways, the shake of Abu Dhabi has the most influence, the most enthusiasm. He is a black belt. That's the guy. Yeah. If anybody's to take shape, top nunes, the guy who's going to take this and make it mainstream, I think he should do each tournament on a separate day. Make it like a week thing everyday at different and just one movie that you see or maybe two a day, you see it one at a time, you stream it, you know, you do it one at a time. To me, I, I knew I had a feeling it was going to, it's going to be that powerful when you watch it unfold. But when we actually did Ebi wanting to man, it was, it was incredible to the people that were there were coming up to me and saying constantly.

Speaker 1:          01:56:29       And I mean they were saying that was the best tournament I've ever seen. It's only because they saw that way one match at a time. By the time they got the GL Martinez and Jeff Glover in the final triple overtime, the place went nuts. Do you think it's possible to do something like this and stream it like a Netflix service? We're a bunch of people already have the service and all they have to do is just click on it, you know, or an apple TV type deal where a lot of people already have that. Like if you get access to Netflix, you get access to $70, million homes. There's still people that for whatever reason, they don't have the ability to get the Internet on their TV so you don't get them. But the people that do. The people that have Internet connected TV, a lot of fucking people have Netflix, man.

Speaker 1:          01:57:13       Yeah. So much. So they're sponsoring television shows. They're making their own shows. They got this Marco Polo show that's pretty fucking dope dude. And it's like a really expensive show. Like you could tell they spent a lot of money making this thing. I'm down to take Abi to the ultimate heights. I just want. I want you Jitsu on TV. There's no reason why we can't have a Jujitsu TV on TV. We have dog Frisbee, we have all this crazy Frisbee dudes pulling tractor trailers with teeth. Come on, you can't. You can't put metamorris on TV. You can't put Abudabi on TV. I think it just. It's really simple. It's got to be some mission only. It's got to be Nogi. If it's going to be on tv, you ain't going to see on TV. Have better chance putting chess on TV. Yeah, I agree with you with that.

Speaker 1:          01:57:54       There's just a lot of matches that wind up being stalemates where they're holding onto the collar and it's also. It's, it's as much as it's an interesting learning tool and it's a great. It's great to learn that if you get in a fight with someone who's got a winter coat on. The reality is when we're looking at sport like combat sport, we're looking at Jujitsu, we're looking at Jujitsu and MMA. They should be interchangeable and they're not. They're not interchangeable. When you have a gate, they are when you have no gate, so it seems pretty cut and dry straight forward. I mean, I think if someone just wants to do Jujitsu and ag, it's fun to do. It's great. It's a great way to do it. It's a good way to slow the game down. You know, a lot of older guys like it, especially because of that reason.

Speaker 1:          01:58:31       It's like chess. Chess is a great game to play. You have to be really smart. It's, it's, uh, it's fun to play, but you're not going to put it on Fox anytime soon. Nothing wrong with Jujitsu with the gay. But I agree that for the, for Nogi, like the difference between Nogi is it just smoothly transitions into mma except for a few variables like the getting punched when you go in for leg locks and stuff, the UFC is the hottest rising sport on the planet. There's millions and millions and millions of fans all over the world that are rabid fans of the UFC. There's no reason why there can't be 1 million of those fans that are into Nogi Jujitsu because really it's the same thing just without the striking. It's on the ground. It's the same objective during the same positions standing. There's no striking, but it's if you love mma, you should be able to appreciate some good grappling his office as exciting.

Speaker 1:          01:59:22       The formats, right. There's no points and look, you know, it's a single matches. There's no reason why you can get a fraction of all those UFC fans. Realistically, I'm low balling. I don't know if it's done right. If it's done right and marketed right, I believe you can get 25 percent, 40 percent see there being some sort of a cable television show where they do it, you know, like a spike TV, like spike TV has Friday night, they have all combat sports now they have boxing, they're having glory and then they have this TV. That's why I got as many people have that. That's a big drop. Is it a big drop in access over spike of giant drop? Really big drop. Spike is in way more households than access TV is millions and millions more. Way More. Yeah. I mean, I dunno, maybe Jamie could find out the actual numbers, but uh, if I had to guess I'd have differences.

Speaker 1:          02:00:12       Probably like $50 million plus it'd be perfect on spike. Yeah. Well that kind of a place where you would get where people were already watching it, you know they've already got it tuned in. Not that there's anything wrong with access TV, access TV. He's got some awesome fights. That's where you get lion fights like it's the only place where you could watch. Not Lions. Moitai. You ever watch it live and what's that? No, no, no. Lion fight is probably the number one more tie organization in America as far as exposure because of television. Like Kevin Ross was legit and boy guys with more rules bigger than glory. No, because it's. Gloria is not Moitai. Gloria's kickboxing. The difference being you can't clench. You can't throw a nice. The body can throw elbows in the clench. You can't do a lot of things that you do in white tie, like Moitai real more tied oftentimes winds up being a grapple fest where they grab a hold of each other in a blast each other with knees to the body along the ropes.

Speaker 1:          02:01:01       Like that's a big part of [inaudible] if you watch it in Thailand, we watched some high level matches. These guys clench up with each other and they blast each other with the body. They dump each other, they sweep each other all the time and it's just a different thing when you're adding in knees and elbows and Gloria doesn't have that, just like k one didn't have that k one. You can only for a while you could throw elbows with two knees, but then a lot of dudes came over there and it just blasted guy or two, uh, two hands behind the head. And then it became illegal to even throw knees with two hands behind the head. You can only use one hand behind that. The owner of glory came to you and said, Joe, I respect your opinion. What do you think we should do with the rules of surely go full moly.

Speaker 1:          02:01:38       Tie with 100 percent abso-fucking-lutely. How long can they cleanse a better sport? It's a sport. It's more exciting. It's the true art of standup. The true art of standup involves throwing stand up, throwing strikes in the clench, throwing stuff like Moitai involves a lot of elbows in tight Moitai evolves manipulating bodies and leading people into knees leading like Allen Joe Ban, perfect example and his last UFC bout the way turn that dude into that elbow that is more Thai applied to mma. I mean it's a combination of grappling your opponent and striking and that's a big part of Moitai and you don't see that as much in glory because I think it was along the lines of what they were trying to do with k one, two. They thought it would be make it more exciting if you had less clinching, more exciting and the guys wouldn't get cut up, which is what they're worried about for tournament's.

Speaker 1:          02:02:27       But I think tournament's was striking is super fucking dangerous anyway. I think they're asking for trouble by having a guy like Joe Schilling, five three. He's fighting Simon motherfucking Marcus, you know, and then after Simon mark is fucking fighting Wayne motherfucking Barrett. And then after that he's fighting art and motherfucking 11 to three, the baddest motherfuckers on earth. And you're throwing head kicks and punches and elbow. You can't have elbows in there because you get cut up. So the the idea of tournament's, you're preserving, making sure the fights happen more often, but you can do it. You would've killed the kicking each other in the head. Shin kicks the head cut. You open like a fucking cerated knife. I mean that can happen all the time because you're always going to wind the risk of the guy not being able to get into the finals if he gets head kicked.

Speaker 1:          02:03:11       No towards events into dangerous. Bring back full time. Full Moitai. No tournament's use tournament's for grappling tournaments are awesome for Jujitsu, for Ebi, for Metamorris tournament to the way to go for, for kickboxing, 100 percent Moitai. It's a more effective art. Is it too late for them to tweak? Committed to these. There's like, like no, it's never too late. They own the company. They own the company. Switch it up. Yeah, they have bell tour. Then they have a way more dangerous sport anyway. As far as like with the public's perception would be because you're adding in takedowns and submissions, you're just adding, you're just adding elbows and knees. They should totally be able to do that and then more time in the clench allow guys to clench because those guys like a guy like Simon Marcus, you take away his clinch, you take away a big part of his game.

Speaker 1:          02:03:55       A lot of his game is. He's a really strong guy who's excellent. The plum. He manipulates dudes and he's blasting you in the by boom, boom. That's a big part of his fucking game. A huge part. Elbows in the clench. Those are. That's a huge part. You take that away and you're forcing them to just kick box and I just think it's not as good. Still Fun. Glories. Awesome to watch. Still exciting. Just not as good as if it was like full more tyrell. Damn. I wonder if he's going to take that advice. I hope so man, because full Mike more tight rules is also way more technical. You Watch and way more like you. You never know what the fuck. Like a guy like Kevin Ross, he's a. it's a perfect example. He's a guy who fights total Thai style or like bull a cow. When you see that guy, use everything knees to the body, elbows in the clench, upward coming in,

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       step off to the side, leg kicks across the front of the thigh to use in all these different techniques. There's so many of the clench needs. The body needs, the body, elbows, all that stuff is a part of the sport and you, you, you try to make it more exciting. That's when elite ECC were saying that you'd go to the ground but only for 15 seconds and then you have to stay on your backup. We're like, this isn't fucking mma. When big country had our Laski down and he was working at Kamora and they stood him up from side control. He's inside control. He's got the risk pin down. He's feeding his arm through and he's about to try to attempt to comorbidity. They're standing up and we're like, what the fuck is this? How many times where it was there a bad stand up during a UFC fight?

Speaker 2:          02:05:16       When I was in your ear and I'm like, Oh my God, Oh my God, what the fuck? And then all of a sudden you start, you start, you let it. I love anytime there's a quick setup. Anytime there's any standup, I love it when you say something I shouldn't be at all exists. It's only five minutes. You have five minutes to get a guy to the ground and submit them and the guys trying to kick your fucking head off the idea that you should be stood back up because it's boring. Look, if it's boring, then you know what's going to happen. Less people going to buy your paper view less. People are going to pay to see you fight. You're going to make less money. If you want to finish guys, you're going to make more money. The market should dictate your style. The rules should be the rules of fighting and fighting.

Speaker 2:          02:05:57       Sometimes a guy like ben asked when can hold you down and do whatever the fuck he wants and the idea that you get to be stood up. You get a second shot at kicking his fucking teeth in. No, he took, he took you down, he held you down. Especially when every. Especially when every Ralph start standing up for the striker. Exactly. If you wanted a to lead that fight company, that was totally fair. When the fight ends up there on the ground in the amount, the next round should start just like that. And the amount, right? Yes. Now you starting standing up again and you know what I think. I think it would be more exciting. I think if they just let the market dictate, just let it decide. Just the rules. Make it more primitive, make less rules, get the f out of the mix, get them out mixed with block subjective tires and they're like, whatever subjective ideas he has, what's what's good or what's not?

Speaker 2:          02:06:53       Come on guys. You gotta fight. I go crazy. I'm like, they're fighting with the fuck. Do you think they're doing? You see that guy, me and that guy in the leg that's called fighting or is telling the rough, make them fight. That was the Gary Shaw thing in the taxi. He told them to stand people up. So you've got guys like Orlowski wind up knocking big country out, which is kind of fucked up because big country was dominating that fight and if they stayed on the ground, he probably would have stayed on top of him. I don't see our last people reversing big country, big countries. Jujitsu is legit. He's a big fucking strong dude. He's working for a position that he earned. He got you to the ground. It's fucking hard to do that. We'll grow lawsky. You get them to the ground, you get them inside control and some fucking sole job of a promoter decides that you have to stand these guys up because they want war.

Speaker 2:          02:07:40       The crowd wants war. We're fighting. We're not spit and fucking Salami sandwiches flying out of his mouth is. He's talking. That guy gets to dictate what happens in a professional martial arts event. That's insane. How crazy would it be if there was a lead that took out standups and you started the next round? Exactly. In the same spot. How hard would that be? Hard. Is that hard? No. No, no. Not only that, that's how it should be. That's how it should be. If people want to have a break, if you want to get back up, you shouldn't have to work to get back up. If a guy takes you down and he's got your fucking you mounted, he's just punching your face and the buzzer rings. She didn't solve that. You didn't solve that issue. Got An issue, man. You've got a guy on top.

Speaker 2:          02:08:22       You punched in the face. If this is on the school yard, if this isn't a fucking field somewhere, that guy would still be on top of you. Yup. So look, we're going to give you a minute to get your cardio back to make it more exciting, but that's it. And even that, guess what? That's a little suspect. You'd be the fight should be 10 minutes. Maybe the presenter, many fight should be 10 minutes and the main events should be 15 or 20. No fucking breaks. Hey, I'm down with that hell breaks. That would be. That's real. MMA. MMA is not rounds. You know? I know the girls would get upset. They don't get to walk around every five minutes. Their jobs. They would still be there at the beginning and the end. It would just be a few less of these, a few less. I don't think it's.

Speaker 2:          02:09:00       They still are an integral part of the organization. They're beautiful. They're fun to be around. Nothing wrong with octagon girls. Nothing wrong. It's not an anti octagon grow rant. I love those girls. It's importance of freight. Where's listed? Where's the cage answers in a ring card girl is at your event. Then we're going to use dudes. You know, we're trying to make it more friendly for gays, transgenders, straight people that like watching dudes in their underwear. There's not a good representation of the male form. There's a small market. You know there's, there's a huge gay Brazilian Jujitsu to community in West Hollywood. You know that right? They go to all the local tournament. They show up. They got the rainbow geese. I haven't. I haven't spoken with you. I could smile that he can't hold. Sometimes you gotta look the corners of his mouth, they start shaking.

Speaker 2:          02:09:47       It's just keep it together. Mr Brown, you believe for a second that I believe. Sure. So it works. We'll get, you know, there will be some day it keeps going. There will be gay guys are notoriously fit. Hey, why would, why wouldn't a gay guy won a Jujitsu? Right? You got to roll with other dudes. Come on and get into the missionary you to take their bags, balls in their face to. A lot of times they should be obsessed with. It should be there probably on their national sport. Maybe this is going to inspire them to come clean with it. Maybe there's a lot of dudes out there. You're going to just take the regular day off and they got a Rambo underneath. I have nothing against gay guys. I'm sure I have like five or six gay guys in high school. Hey, I'm not racist, but it's just don't get boners while you roll and everything will be fine.

Speaker 2:          02:10:38       The Gay version of, I'm not racist but racing, but why not homophobic? But if you roll with me, don't get a hard on because I am fucking beautiful. It's like what you're saying. You're saying, how could you not get a little bit? A little guy gets hard. You're still gonna roll with it. No, no. You can say your. Your contact or contact only homophobic. If you expect the guy to get hard and you're upset before the match even starts, you gotta let the guy have the opportunity to get hard and they say, hey man, can you can't like start off going, hey man, don't get hard. If we wrestle like, fuck dude, that's like hanging out with the black dude. Go here, move. Don't rub me like. And he's like out. I think only gay white belts get hard ons. I think my blue belt, he learned to control it.

Speaker 2:          02:11:27       I think there's a lot of gay white belts. Don't get hard at all. I think you're at a lot. I'm just saying generally dennis will. Have you ever gotten a hard rolling with the girl? Never. There you go. That's what I'm saying. And you wanted the horniest people that's ever walked the face of the planet. But I'm rolling with girls like every. There's hardly no girls frequency. You'd get more talking about zero percent going to go up. To say that Hugh Jitsu was the opposite. If we lived in the twilight zone and 98 percent of the people doing Jujitsu for women, and I was one of them rare dudes, I'd be like, hell yeah, I'm going to do Jujitsu forever. That's how probably girls feel, right? Just get mauled all the time by giant dudes. Hey, who said that? Jesus Christ. Why she entering the heavyweight class girls, girls that dishes here too.

Speaker 2:          02:12:12       They're like, Oh, these guys are geniuses. We get choked. Her attention is incredible, but she finds herself in north south all the time. It's so weird. It's ridiculous. Makes Sense. Like she's so good at retaining garbage. It almost seems like she turns into north south from the bottom. I don't understand what's happening. Oh, that's a crazy sport. It's a craziest pillow boy. First girl, first girl. When I was a purple belt, I brought. Did you get to to. She wanted to watch. She couldn't believe that she got. She was sweating. She couldn't believe to her. She just saw sexual positions. That's all she saw was. How do you guys do this? She was turned on by guys wrestling with guys. Guys. Some girls like that, some girls do. Girls want to find out who wins. Take a sperm. That's what they want to do. You know some guys, some guys, some guys like two dudes getting gay together, some girls like that, right?

Speaker 2:          02:13:10       Dude, no comment on that one. No clue. Yes. Well we have a woman in the room, I'll tell you. Ordain will tell us she's nodding. So I think girls do you know girls that uh, are not gay, but somehow two gay guys getting together turns them on. Same in France. In Italy. In Italy. Yeah. Bitches. Crazy. Those are crazy. Say Twenty percent of women that you know, maybe higher and it turns you on. You don't want to laugh. You're not watching to laugh. Gay Girl Porn or gay men porn. Why? We got to end this conversation. I throw us about the throat microphone I mailed. It was through watching some dude balls deep in another guy's ass and a girl playing with herself. That's the last two month. Egos are so strong. It's so important for us to not get dominated by another man. You're like, his balls are right here.

Speaker 2:          02:14:08       I don't give a fuck. I'm going almost stop the choke right here and his balls are right here. You're like, that doesn't mean shit. It's going to hurt more. If he taps me, then have his balls hit my cheek. Just like blocking the chuck. Right? It's more important. You're not thinking about any sexuality at all. In Jujitsu, you're thinking about not getting tapped. You Band, Tie Cups, those steel cups. Don't bet anything. You don't. You allow guys to wear those steel companies, what they wear, whatever they want. I'm not going to stop them from protecting their balls, you know, but it's not that. The idea is there's leverage. Yeah. Do you believe that Gary, that it's increased leverage anywhere? A Steel Cup? Certainly more efficiently. Break arms, legs. Do you wear one? No, I don't want one. When I compete, I just never have. So it would.

Speaker 2:          02:14:49       It would be awkward to start doing it right before. It seems like there'll be a massive benefit. If it's illegal, would be some. Some organizations been cups in it. Totally. Yay. Because it'll leverage. God Damn it. I got another Einstein Story. Einstein was passing my guard and he hit my Dick with his knee. I didn't think anything of it until I went to the bathroom. After I was done rolling in. My jock strap was filled with blood. Mr. couple years now and so I started. I, I peed and blood came out of my Dick. I'm like fuck. And I was trying to think, should I go to the doctor because I knew if I went to the doctor, like I'll go, okay, what would I do? If it was my nose, I go, why wouldn't go to the doctor? I would see what's going on. So I went home and a little bit more important than your nose though.

Speaker 2:          02:15:27       It is, but I went on when I jerked off, I just want to make sure my dick works in my sperm was like the cover of the metallica album load. It's blood and sperm. It was like one of them chicken eggs where something went wrong, you know, you get one of those chicken eggs, it's got a little fetus in it or something. That's what it was like. It was clumps, but it worked out. It did work out and then I peed. The next day was I had blood for a few days though. It was blood that was coming out for a few days, but it never got infected. I was like, if it feels infected, I'm going to the doctor because otherwise they're gonna be staring at my Dick. It's going to be awkward. They going to put q tips up there and then probably say nothing. You're probably not going to do anything for you.

Speaker 2:          02:16:03       So I was like, you made the right call and is cops are the way to go because that shit wouldn't have happened. Yeah. Especially like a steel cup. Constantly squeezing my knees and every part of my game, the needs are generally squeezing, so I'm in constant protect ball mode anyway. So you don't wear makeup? Never. Do you ever wear one of those diamonds? You ever try those diamond and try it and never. Would you be interested in trying? I got them here. You want one? I'm afraid balls are going to hang out and then someone's gonna Smash. My mom like vandelay Silva. It's like compression shorts. I met Gilbert Ivo vandelay Silva us, right. The ball got caught after that guy was laying on the floor longer than that pain. You know that pain you get where you feel like you're going to get sick. He had other kind of pain, like a ball smashed.

Speaker 2:          02:16:44       I remember that. Well there. I think he had a regular cup, those regular cups, so this is way before they had these compression short cups. There's a couple of companies, Jocko does them to a couple of companies, but diamond mma, I think they started it. They have a cop that's contoured. Jamie, go grab one of those things. They need to take a bunch of them. They sent them to me. They don't have any affiliation with this company. I just want to say they need to take a mold of your Dick and then make a mold. Rubber Jelly thing. No, no, no, no. Where it's soft. I thought about what if you. Dick gets hard. It gets trapped and it's like you're choking your dick out. You're to question. That's we haven't. He wants to make like mouthpieces. Yeah, like a mouthpiece, like an earpiece mouthpiece or one of those ear.

Speaker 2:          02:17:24       You just can't ever get turned on. Yeah. Yeah. So this is why would you. It's Jujitsu. It's other sweaty dudes. See they have a cup that's kind of contoured. And Scott, so this is. No, I don't think that's the way to go. The whole idea that the point is if your Dick is hanging out, I'm telling you, dude, you were with these compression shorts. These shorts are crazy. They have all these straps in them and it's all the suck that thing right up against your junk. I need to protect your hawks on. You don't need to do it. Not Outside your pants. It's just too.

Speaker 2:          02:17:56       I'm not saying I got a big. I'm just saying it's thick. It's bigger than this. It's not that big. It's this thick. It's bigger than that. That's all you're saying, but you should try it. It's a good idea. You don't need a commentator to match a Louis Fernando Vasconcellos and king of the cage, and I forgot about Fernando against Shonie. Carter and Carter showed up at the cup, like it looked like actually sit on the telecast. I go, you know, uh, uh, Bob Sapp called, he wanted his cut back, his cup of so tremendous. That was a weapon. It was like something that you'd wear the like Mad Max and Shit. You know what I mean? Like anybody tried to kick him in the balls and there's like blades and shit or something. It was huge. But when you wrote with a guy who's got one on a steel cup and they get on top of you, you could feel that thing.

Speaker 2:          02:18:40       It's like a weapon. Like they're fucking. You heard somebody ribs or combat like, yeah, you hurt your sternum, your solar plexus, your like, you, you want to get out of that position and an arm bars. It's got to make a giant difference. It's a big chunk of metal knee bars. It's almost like an angle. There's an angle like you have a leverage point where your Dick and how about you put a dude in a triangle and you owe angle on their face is right in that anytime you put a dude in a triangle and you're like, his head's just in the wrong angle. Like if you pull this head, you're just like stuffing his head one. Is it worth it? I'm going to try to tap them with like an arm or something here. That was one of the match. Didn't want to talk to you about. Is Your Hobby Vasquez mad? Yeah. Yeah. Dude, that was such a slick submission man because you, you, you're known for your leg locks and it's kind of like hobby was defending. Well

Speaker 6:          02:19:28       an obvious really good defense anyway, and then you switched it up and went for that triangle and cut the triangle on the side. As I move forward with my matches and things like there's certain situations where I'm just at all costs trying to submit somebody and beat them in whatever way that I possibly can. I specifically in that match, I had every intention because I had just beaten like a really good leg locker. Marcin held. I had every intention of trying to not submit them with a leg lock real. Uh, I didn't. Yeah, I didn't want to because I don't want to be known as, I don't want to be known as just the guy that does leg locks, you know what I mean? I want to be known as a fucking killer on the map getting. But still, you were still attempting them though.

Speaker 6:          02:20:05       But I caught them with Ronnie in, but I had no intention of finishing it. Rarely thought about finishing it and said, no, that's not what I want to do. I tried, I tried six different times. I didn't let it go. He, he like, pushed out of it really hard. Um, I, um, what was I gonna say? Uh, uh, multiple times I tried to set up an arm triangle from, we'd call it, like a scoop Scorpion, but it's a, what's it called? Lockdown. Right. So from the lockdown position, trying to pass his arm across and set up arm triangle triangles. Because I had been wondering the bottom, bottom and top. Yeah, that's what I'd been practicing and training. That's how I wanted to submit them, but it wasn't working out, but I'd also been practicing some triangle setups. Uh, so, you know, that's those two ways work.

Speaker 6:          02:20:46       I was kind of going back and forth between that, trying to submit them. When you set up the iron arm triangle from the bottom, do you try to finish it from the bottom or do you sweet? Uh, I think, I think I, my preferred finish, the absolute best for me is to be slightly to be on bottom, but to be on my hip as opposed to be facing up towards the sky, so side onto the person perpendicular. Uh, that's my favorite finish. But I, uh, saw aside from that, finishing it just directly flat facing up I think is worse than finishing it on top. On top is better because you can move your hips, you can move on and I'll top. It's always better to get your weight, but on the bottom, the only way it's going to work on the bottom generally if you've got to have that locked down in without the lockdown, because if I have the lockdown and I have the arm trying on the bottom, I'm just going to stay there and try to finish it from there, don't you?

Speaker 6:          02:21:28       You sometimes go sideways on a guy and you have the lock down as well, which puts your knee a really funky angle talking about the arm chair and going from the bottom, from stoner control. When the lead comes all the way till you still hold the locked down. It's like you go into the vaporizer, but instead you go for the arm triangle. Yeah, yeah, Yep. No, that's a. that's a precarious position and you get a lot of letters from there. It's hard to set that one up because once you go through the leg, you still have the lockdown and it's hard to reach. You got really screwed up there and he's got to kind of give it to you. It's hard to set that one up because you set it up if you let go the lockdown to pass the guard because you're basically in a lead drag position with the lockdown.

Speaker 6:          02:22:06       It's the same thing. You can pass and commit to that arm triangle. You could keep the lockdown role to a vaporizer or you could get a vaporizer by just simply turning and they're just sitting back nice and slow where there's no role and you go to it. You are. Um, your match was interesting because when you guys were commentating on that match to when you saw he got to that position, the side trying to set up that triangle, you got fired up. You're like, wow. Yeah. You're like, this is a, this is a bad situation. This is a bad spot. I'm, I know that Gary's, he's, he's, uh, his guillotines or death as far as I'm sure you have way more than I know. But I know I've seen you. I know you got all around Jujitsu game and I understand you and you don't want to be known as the lead guy because you do have really good, like your guillotine is right up there with the top guys and your, the way you get to the back elite level, um, you got a lot of stuff going on.

Speaker 6:          02:23:02       Do you have a very active game from the bottom a? Was it a shock to me? I mean, you've been training essentially Jujitsu for about nine years. It'll be, it'll be eight years, uh, the day of his tournament, March 20 seconds. My jujitsu manner. That's amazing. You've been able to have so much progress in such a short time. That's incredible. You must really love it. You must be just fucking obsessed with since day one. For sure. I was just on the mat as much as possible. I never really took any breaks. I'm just constantly training and competing as much as I possibly could. Do you remember what dragged you into it? Like what got you so excited about it? So, uh, at first the, just like the sport, I didn't know it existed until I was 14 and my buddy was like, hey, yeah, I do this thing, it's kind of like wrestling where you get to strangle people.

Speaker 6:          02:23:47       And I was like, data here, that's bullshit. Nobody lets that happen. And I was like, you're a kid. Like nobody likes to kids try and strangle each other. That's, you didn't know me that UFC. Uh, no, not at that time. Wow, that's great. No idea. So this is like four or five. I was living with a, I was living with my mom. She was a single parent that, you know, I mean not that she would have disapproved of that or anything like that, but it's not like it would have been something I would've been, you know, brought interest to, you know, they didn't talk about it at school or anything. Maybe you heard about it, but then look into it. Yeah. No, it wasn't, it wasn't a big part of the culture that I was in. You know what I mean? So I did, yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:24:19       It just never. Nobody ever really brought it up and tell my one friend that happened to be training Jujitsu. Once I learned about that, that's when I started learning about UFC and stuff like that, you know, I hadn't really experienced any of that. So that's what got me into the sport, but not like obsessed with it. I was like, I was like, wow, that sounds really cool. Went to a competition. I was like, that's the coolest fucking thing ever. My mom was not about it. She was like, yeah, that's not okay. You can't do that. But eventually I convinced her and then, uh, what really kept pushing me forward was the one turning point moment where, uh, I was training with Tom to blast my instructor and I actually, I was training with somebody else first and I, they, I was trying to escape a triangle and Tom comes over to help me, like to try and help me get out of the triangle.

Speaker 6:          02:25:02       I wasn't doing it properly and I was like he, he gave me advice and then I go oh yeah, but I usually do this like, like in a very standoffish, like talking back sort of a way like a, like a child would, you know what I mean? So I talked back to him and it was really bad, like disrespectful, you know, in whatever way I said it. So Tom Goes, oh okay let's train you now let's see how well you get out of the triangle then lets, lets go. So he's trained with me for a grand total of about 35 minutes. I would say every two to five minutes after he would submit me multiple times he would say, do you want to stop? And every time I was like no because I didn't think my beating was done. Like I thought I deserved to get the shit kicked out of me.

Speaker 6:          02:25:41       So I didn't stop. You had said something? Yeah I knew, I knew right from the get go I fucked up. Right. So he starts training to me. I get at the end of the match leads to a start, like a sternum bruise the size of Ironmans fucking circle on his chest, like d burn, blood bloody cuts all over my face from fucking Eastbourne. And like, literally it was, it was definitely child abuse, like should could have been arrested if I like complained, you know, but I would never, you know, because I deserved it and it made me stronger person. But after that it was like that, uh, that, that pie may experience where, you know, in kill bill volume two, she's like a, you know, beatrice is getting the shit kicked out of her by May and she was like being held down by the arm, like, do you want this power, you know, that sort of thing.

Speaker 6:          02:26:25       And uh, you know, I wanted that power to be able to fucking, you know, have control over my feet and have control over, you know, being able to defend myself against another person, be able to, um, you know, act in that way. And then from that point on when I was in love with Jujitsu or eventually, you know, in love with competing and wanting to teach and all that stuff. So is that what you're white belts? No, no, I don't. I do a, I probably should though, if I wanted more. Actually I do do that to my, to my student that I'm trying to bring up, Gordon Ryan. I'd beat the crap out of them as much as possible and try to demean him and make him whoa. Just feel horrible to them on the DL.

Speaker 1:          02:27:01       You know what big brother? Um, takeaway one day, like Henzel says that, you know, even his brothers, they were younger than him that are better than him. And it's like I'm always there. Big Brother. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I try, I try my best. I think that's how you make people good man. There's something to that for sure. But there's also something to just like being really lucky and having a great instructor. Yeah. You know, when a kid hasn't instructed like you that's so passionate about the game, like one of the hardest parts about Jujitsu and the day was finding real good instructor. You know, Eddie and I got super lucky. We found John Jacques Machado. No, but if you didn't find him, if you were in like, you know, the middle of nowhere, South Dakota and there's no good instruction. It's hard. It's hard to find like a really good instructor at such a big deal to have like a good camp when you have like a 10th planet, Jiu Jitsu or Benzos Academy or art of Jujitsu, like these big Jujitsu places where all these killers come from such a giant advantage. So it's so huge. We're so lucky here in southern California. I mean, what, what's better as far as locations on earth than the Brazilians, like the beach and Miami. But Miami. Yeah. When you find like the ones that are like, fuck man, I'm going to go to Toronto. There's a lot of trying.

Speaker 6:          02:28:14       Sallow went to Ohio for a little bit and I remember thinking, man, have Brazilian in Ohio. How long was that going

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       to jail? They wrote, this project has been up there for a, an American Brazilian. He's uh, he's, he's white. Well, how about a fucking Gabriel Gonzaga. He's in western Massachusetts. Man. He's in the middle of nowhere. It's in Ludlow, I think with the name of the place. He see these places make people stronger. You guys in California don't know. Pain and suffering. You guys get to live in this nice weather all the time. To go from Rio to that part of western Massachusetts where Gonzaga lives. Fuck you went from like one of the most beautiful spots on earth to a place for, for six months. It's sucks. A fat plated digs. What else do you have to do besides train? Man, there's so much other things to do here. What's that? Have you been in Brazil? Uh, no. Not yet. I'm looking forward to it for this next day.

Speaker 3:          02:29:06       80 eight. Oh Shit. I mean they haven't put out official official invites that Saul. Paulo, right. Hopefully you're in 100 percent. We'll see cios and he qualified. So I'll be there for sure. It's going to be in Sao Paolo, August 28th and August 29th. Um, there bunch of Tenth Planet Gadget Gone, man. It's going to be awesome. You should go reserve that weekend one if I can. Gel is gonna. Come out with that. Let me see if I can. I don't know what my, my shit. Swole, my friend Michael gets half a Mendez. It might be held against Alpha. You never know what's going to happen that stands out. I just, there's so many good guys these days. It's really seriously is on another level, man is on another level. You were saying that a lot. He is breakdancing. Strength from the percent. Yesterday I did an inside Bjj podcasts and they asked me what is the single most important attribute to Jiu Jitsu if you only have one attribute.

Speaker 3:          02:29:59       And uh, my answer was initially was a, I would like to say openmindedness true open mindedness, but there's a lot of close minded guys out there that are the best in the world. So it can't be that. That's a good point. It can't be that. I thought about it for two seconds and it has to be athleticism, athleticism. You get a guy coming in who's been doing gymnastics his whole life and he's high level. That guy's going to get really good at Jujitsu in one month, in one month, and that's Geo and his brother Boogie. Both of them just really quick. Got their black belts. They're just, their athleticism is just off the charts. They could do the craziest shit with their hands standing on the hand, spinning around, landing their balance. Their, their, their core strength is off the charts and, and the crazy thing is geo got so good so quick.

Speaker 3:          02:30:48       He got his, you know, he's got his black belt. Like Sabrina did. Got His black belt in three and a half years. He did. Gopal went on his whole life. That's athleticism, breakdancing, the kind of break dancing geo does. That's athleticism. That's like super hyper, super evolve. Breakdancing. It's crazy. So it doesn't. He got so his black belt so quick, but it is his rises and stopping. It's not like okay. He caught up and that's it. That athleticism that got him, that black belt so quick is going to take them to the next level quicker and those higher levels quicker. He is getting better. All the isn't enough to beat someone that can have Amanda's cassava. Mendez is unreal. Unreal. Half Amanda's defense. No one ever does anything to them. Anytime he loses it's on some advantage or something. If he loses. Other than that, you can do anything to him.

Speaker 3:          02:31:33       You know, there's a matches of him or roles within what? Enrico was way bigger than him and he's tapping into a Cuban cornelius. There's a match online is way bigger than half a half a gallon and I know there's other matches where maybe keen and taps him, but apparently no one's tapping on that. Is the top guy in the world at 1:45 in ADCC. We'll see if is ready for that. Maybe. Maybe half a smashes. You don't know. Maybe it's too soon. Right now. Maybe it's going to take another three or four years to catch them catch up, but we're gonna find out and I really believe geo is on another level. I roll with them all the time, man, and I can't do shit to him no more. I'm like, fuck this guy, and he's lighter than me. I got 20 pounds on. Yeah, it's amazing.

Speaker 3:          02:32:16       It's amazing. It's amazing. What we learned too, that that break dancing is a doorway to yes and mastics. Everybody always knew wrestling. Of course, his first month he was all overdues like Holy Shit. Shawn [inaudible] brought them over to me and said, dude, this guy is on another level and he has a break dancing crew called the freak show and all of those guys were doing and they all got good. All of them really quick, but Geo and buggy or the only ones that stuck with it, the other break dancers just went back to breakdancing. They dabbled in it for like a year and a half and got really good. All of them really good right away. Professional Jujitsu in six months we're like, holy fuck. There's moves that you do in break dancing that require like insane balance and coordination and strength like Steve Maxwell Hmi. Do these crazy workouts the other day where you're doing like this push up and then you pick one hand up and then you pick one leg up and then you lift the other knee off the ground by two inches and you're holding it there, so one legs forward using like a superman position, right?

Speaker 3:          02:33:15       You're in what you're holding yourself up with, one hand and one foot on the other side and your knee is off the ground and the leg is up and the hand is up and you're just holding it. It's insanely difficult. Now you gotta show me after I'll show you afterwards. It's insanely difficult, but then you think about what these guys are doing. They're standing on one hand, they're spinning around with their legs up in the air. It's not that old school standard basic breakdancing that you saw and it's got their style is they do crazy weird things. They're always evolving and new moves and new and that translates to Jujitsu to me. Better than wrestling, better than gymnastics. I've never seen it from day one. I seen them come up and his. What he's doing is he's just getting started. This is just the beginning of Geo Gary. Tone and break dancing moves your cardboard with you. You laid that shit out. You started planning system is off the charts too. He's doing back flips like it's nothing, right? You can do a lot of crazy. He's doing fly

Speaker 6:          02:34:18       enroll in Camorra's. He's doing that fly and uh, what do you call it? Sisera take. He's doing all. So he's very arrogant. So his athleticism is off the charts as well. What's your ultimate goal? What do you, if you, do you have goals that you've set for yourself as far as your competition career which you want to achieve? Yeah, I think the main goal right now is to bring submission, grappling to that level we're talking about to where it's, you know, it's an exciting spectator sport that, you know, people can get paid to do and it's like a career, you know? Um, that's, you know, obviously, you know, personally that's kind of my goal, but it's kind of a goal for the sport at the same, same. It's just perfect timing. Ladies. He sees obviously a big goal, you know, it's coming up, you're hotter than ever.

Speaker 6:          02:34:57       You're the shining star of Metamorris Ebi welterweight champion and we're doing the welterweight championship. It's like everything just aligned perfectly, man. I'm like, fuck, I'm, I'm lucky that I listened to Scotty Nelson and brought Gary Toner and I'm lucky man. I really want to be a part of it, man. I did. I appreciate this tremendously, man. I have to ask you about this because people keep bringing it up. I hear you have a terrible diet. Oh yeah. Is that true? Yeah. A vegans everywhere hate me. Um, I don't know what it is, but we'll see. I took so metamorris the guys that video tape, like the pre fight whatever bs, right? So they're like, okay, watch a couple of videos that we did in the past and it's like Braulio and Adolfo and both of them are talking about their diet. Like, oh yeah, I just eat like a little bit of grass and like some leaves become big and strong and it's like, come on man, are you serious?

Speaker 6:          02:35:53       Adolfo just eats like Chia seeds all day. Come on man, I saw you, you know what I mean, like, so anyway, I was just like, all right, these guys really have this cleaned up, let's, I'll give them the real look at what my diet is really like, you know, and for me because I'm in between trainings all the time and stuff like that. It's just like I eat whatever I can and I need a high dense amount of calories all the time. So it's like cheeseburgers and pizza and stuff like that. I just, you know, that's my main bulk of my diet now when I wake cut I know how to eat healthy, you know, like when I weight cut I do the right things, you know, eat a lot of fiber. And do you make sure you get a lot of nutrients though? Do you take that?

Speaker 6:          02:36:29       Definitely take vitamins and things and then you know, occasionally I'll, I'll, I'll pump in a few vegetables here and there. But you really don't. She don't eat many vegetables for real. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, like real daily basis. That's we need a man. I'm the same one. I eat a little salad everyday, but a little bullshit El Pollo loco salad or something, you know to. I swear to God, if you just give it a shot, just try drinking Kale shakes in the morning. Have a Kale shake instead of what you normally have for breakfast. It tastes like dog shit. Tastes like it. Tastes like and that's all you pre-cum will that. Will that cover my vegetables for the day? Yeah, I would imagine it would cover your vegetables. Really. That seems to be on it. You, you, you, you mix up some garlic. You mix up some ginger, like a hunk of ginger, like a half a page. You remember what a pager was like? Cut a pager in half that in the blue and sounds

Speaker 5:          02:37:16       too hard. Kale. Celery. Exactly. That. There's so much effort that just went into his garden. The chocolate flavor. Is that good enough? I mean you look, all those things are good. Like either there's earth grown nutrients at on and has garden of life. Has a bunch of drinks. They bridget. Very legit. Okay. Good stuff. It's definitely better than not having it, but the best shit you can get is fresh vegetables. That's the best shit. Fresh vegetables with garlic. Some fruit, like a maybe like a pineapple or apple, some coconut oil, mixed. All that shit up together in a blend. Things kicking everyone's ass, kicking everyone's ass going to be fine. You're. I'm not saying, I'm not saying that like, you know that you know, me eating shitty is leading to me winning or vice versa. I definitely think that for longterm health, like you know, I, I mean I studied, I studied exercise science, I have a degree in exercise science, you know, we had nutrition classes and everything like that and it's clearly you know, for, for your longterm health, like eating well is like the right thing to do just as much as exercising is the right thing to do.

Speaker 5:          02:38:17       But in terms of just my ability to do so on a day to day basis with my training schedule and with everything else is just very, very difficult. Don't make sense, but I don't take as much stock into it as some people believe like, oh, this is going to be that deciding factor, that point one percent that's going to make you beat So-and-so. I don't truly believe that, you know? Um, because uh, I mean ultimately if I lose because my diet wasn't good that day or whatever the case may be, I really just don't feel like I was that good at Jujitsu to begin with. Like, I should be making improvements in Jujitsu. Not, you know, not that I know. Like I said, it's important, but not for. Not for. It's not going to be the deciding factor between me beating somebody. You're not beating. That makes sense.

Speaker 5:          02:38:58       That's just silly. That makes sense in some ways, but in some ways it doesn't because if you think about like you don't have the ultimate optimal conditioning, right? You don't have the ultimate. There's always room for improvement, right? There's always room for improvement in your coordination. There's always room for improvement in your technique. All those things. There was room for improvement. How could it not be room for improvement in your new tissue? Nutritional technique? I what? What technique? Like how do you fuel your body? Certainly is what do you use rooms or improvement in mind, but don't you think there's like a technique to giving yourself the right amount of carbohydrates, certain amount of protein, a certain time. It's a couple of things. He's young and his body is crazy metabolism and he's not being put in positions where he's. He's getting dragged out into deep, deep waters and he's getting tired and now it's the end.

Speaker 5:          02:39:43       It's like a 20 minute match minute 17 and he's going against Marcello Garcia. Then maybe that's where the Diet is going to come into play, but right now he's blowing through everybody so it doesn't matter if he'd dig downs, but that's what I'm saying. Like it doesn't kind of make sense. Saying that a guy beats you wouldn't have beaten you because you nutritionally. I think for the most part. Sorry, go ahead. No, I was going to say, look, the chrome gracie fight like the end of the fight. Was it just his superior technique or was it a combination of being exhausted and meet massive expenditure energy from both parties and I was just in a really, really bad spot. I mean, the guy had my back with like a body triangle. I stood up trying to last ditch efforts to trying to defend the choke. It had nothing to do with.

Speaker 5:          02:40:24       It had nothing to do with my conditioning or anything like that. Was I tired at that point? I can't even remember, but I don't think I was tired. I think I was just in a really shitty spot and that's why I ended up tapping out because I thought I was about to go unconscious. I'm not because I was tired or exhausted. I don't think I would have. I think if you put me in the same situation at a complete 100 percent right before the match, I wouldn't have gotten out any better than I did. They're really. Um, but uh, yeah man, I, I mean, I agree it makes a difference, but not. I don't think that enough for you to stop it from pizza and not, not too good. Fired, I'm like, I felt better about myself if I had my tons of money and like the ability to do that, you know, like Oh, I've got to hire somebody to follow me around and feed me good shit all the time.

Speaker 5:          02:41:05       One hundred percent. I would. You wouldn't want that anyway. That guy would be annoying to have to fly. Right. Telling me to get the fuck away from the pizza. Know for sure. Hey Man, get away from that pizza bro. You good bro. We're going to keep our old poem. I think the human body is an amazing thing to be honest. And I think that it takes pretty much whatever the fuck you put inside of it and turns it into what it needs. So you know, who was notorious for eating a cheeseburger before every fucking games. Michael Jordan. That was like his ritual. He would go to burger king or Mcdonald's rather. And you get a big Mac maybe to anybody eat them before every Michael Jordan. Michael motherfucking. What'd you say? You're talking about people we're talking to bang, boom, potatoes, steak and potatoes. What? That's what he eat everyday.

Speaker 5:          02:41:51       Yeah. But he ate cheeseburgers before for dsps like that. To. Hold on a second. I'm going to agree with this shit. I was a Jordan Fan. Says, okay, I'm pregame meal in 2001. I've compensated for pride. Terrible. Mark Kerr, I met him at the airport at Mcdonald's and he was killing McDonald's. I video taped and everything just to prove that. Look at this. Look at this athlete eating this crap because I have to keep proving to people that it's Mcdonald's. Isn't that bad for you? Oh, it's definitely horrible. I know it is, but it tastes so good. Is it going to drastically affect my athletic performance? I was heated 10 seconds beforehand. Now every Friday my mom would take us to Mcdonald's when she got paid on Friday. So it was like a treat. Oh yeah. Raised as going to Mcdonald's. This is what we've been waiting for all week.

Speaker 5:          02:42:39       So this is so exciting. Okay. I'm incorrect. Or he ate the same meal before every game of 23 on steak. A baked potato and a ginger ale. That's not bad. Big Difference. That's a big difference. That's healthy. Well, why did I hear that? It was a fucking cheeseburger, man. God Damn it. Who the hell was that? Was that somebody else wants Mcdonald's. Oh, so it was a lie. Just those things they spread out. Oh, okay. So this is. Is this like things that are just like, okay, he wants punch Steve, someone, Steve, Kurt, and the phase during practice. We don't need to see all

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       that shit, but okay. So forget what I said. I'm trying to say is fucking dying. Was gonna take that one back already. Good. Some people would take that and say that is that. It's not that good with the grass was a grasp. It probably not. Probably not, but it's just a slightly higher grade of beef. What do you think Carl's junior burger now that the natural burger. It's a no steroids, no added hormones. Yeah, it's supposed to be grass free, right? Grass fed or grass fed. You know what man? Look what a, what a piece of meat is. We have all these attachments to what it is, but it's protein and water. There's not, not a lot of like. There's good aspects to some of the like you get healthier fats from grass fed meat because you get a healthier animal. It's definitely better for you.

Speaker 1:          02:43:56       It's probably more nutritionally dense for you, but you could get by on like regular Burgers, you can get by on regular steak. It's still human. Body's an amazing thing. Yeah, you school good for your body. Your body's taken that animal protein and it's breaking it down and it's making muscle with it. It just does. And the idea that it doesn't because it's a steak and the stakes bad for you. That's stupid. It's a potato. Potatoes are good for you. Okay. You say a baked potato, Yay, that's really good for you. Baked potatoes, the best way this vitamin C and Potassium and baked potato. As a matter of fact, I think there's more potassium in a big potato than a banana. Yep. So yeah, so you've got. That's all healthy shit. The people don't think that's healthy or people that are have an agenda. They're like either vegans or they.

Speaker 1:          02:44:38       They want to promote some really radical idea of nutrition knife. My favorite comment on the Metamorph, the premed Morris video was a gary. Tony needs to stop eating cheeseburgers and buy some proactive, proactive like for visits or whatever. Oh, this. Oh. How dare they ruin. That's awesome. Do you use anything like defense soap? Do you fuck with that stuff for awhile? I, you know, a gooey soap was giving me some stuff I haven't had. I haven't had anybody. Hope is the best, best, best. They just sent me a box of it. I get, I panic when I get low. I used. I'm just such good soap too. Just like that stuff that. It's like a surgical scrub that you use. That shit ain't good for you dude. No, no. That antibiotic soaps now good for you because it kills your natural skin flora. The stuff that they use for hospitals, man, that's intense. Antibiotics. What they try to deal with and use it for my face. Just because the and everything. It might be causing the proactive work though.

Speaker 1:          02:45:35       I use it for a little bit. It worked out right? Sometimes nothing works use. You can only use something for so long and it just gets fucking whatever. Just wash my face every once in a while. I used to have a friend at work as a friar later cook. This motherfucker had the worst I've ever seen in my life. A lot of tax environmental. When you're. When you're famous for choking people out and breaking legs, it don't matter. What if you have zits. Eddy brothers says it doesn't matter, so don't worry about just telling him that. Next, just keep winning. That's the plan. Anyway, that's what I was gonna focus on and set them up, but I don't know how it goes with Zits, but I know with your skin it's actually important to not

Speaker 5:          02:46:10       use the antibacterial soap and they also say you shouldn't shower like any closer than a half an hour before your match because orbit before you train rather because it takes your body time to reestablish the skin for the antibodies. Wrote a whole thing about that is the guy who owns different soap. He wrote a whole thing about that on the think it was on the undergraduate. Not supposed to take a shower before you roll. No, don't put that out there. Now people are going to show up. Snow. Just stick at it. It's got to be more than a half an hour. More than a half an hour for your skin health and probiotics you fuck with probiotics? Only to like settle my stomach occasionally. Not like for the, not for the, uh, for the prevention of like a steady bravo preaches that ringworm ever. Um, I've gotten into a few times.

Speaker 5:          02:46:53       It's not like a consistent problem like some people have with it. Uh, you know, got staff once. So it wasn't, you know, I caught it before it was serious. I don't, I don't know how some people like let staff go to the point where a spider bite, a fucking spider bite on your skin. Like this big like, dude, as soon as I felt like, like, you know, a big swollen fucking pimp while I was like, yeah, it's probably staff. I should go get that look at. And I started to get sick. I was like, yeah, seems about right. I don't know how people don't get that shit. Some people are not tuned into their body, man. I told you the red should fear story, right? We were playing pool and he was limping. I'm like, why are you limping man? He's just got a spider bite my knee.

Speaker 5:          02:47:28       I go, what are the. Let me see your leg, and I go, dude, that staff, you've got to go to a doctor right now. His knee was all swollen and there was like a Zit and I was like, Holy Shit Dude, this is ugly. Eddie has a good story about this. He's training with a dude that had like a giant hole in his, but he didn't actually train with them because as soon as he saw the fucking hole, it was like, let me stay the fuck away from that guy. He's like, dude, what's wrong with you? You're, you definitely have staff, man. He's like, he's like, you should go to the doctor. He's like, yeah, I've been rubbing some like honey on it and stuff. I'm really not into like, you know, the doctor and like into like natural remedies and stuff, you know, just going to keep putting honey on it.

Speaker 5:          02:48:01       It's going to be fine. Those anti banners, those anti-vaccine dudes, he's dead right now, but it's better for the human race because you know, do we really want that to keep living on. Brian Cowen, his friend's wife died from staph infection and she tried to teach, treat it naturally and holistically. They were like doing like all these different weird things and he said he came up with the house and he said she looked like death and her gums were pale and he was like, Jesus fucking Christ. Get her to the doctor, man. Get her to a hospital. They take her to a hospital. It's too late. They get her on the ivy drip. They're trying to give her an antibiotic. Died at like 25 years old, 30 years old because they didn't do this exactly. And especially Murcia like the medication resistant. There's a bunch of different strains of staff that are really difficult to deal with.

Speaker 5:          02:48:43       I'm just going to keep rubbing honey on it. It'll be fine. Yeah. Just take some parsley and you hit it with the pores can. Yeah. Perfect. Fine. Those homeopathic motherfuckers are scary. You got to be real careful with that shit. There's sometimes you need medicine bench. Yep. Madison fucking like if you could syphilis. Don't try to pray that shit away. You need penicillin. Motherfucker. Cillin don't go out like Al Capone. Alright. They figured that out. This. They figured it out. Right? To use the smart dudes knowledge. It's like you don't just jump into Jujitsu as fucking raw white belt. Try to reinvent the game. Right? You shouldn't do that with medicine either. Non Medicine having motherfucker fucking try to rub honey on your staff, bitch. That doesn't work. Yeah. Okay. If it did, we would fucking use that. Yeah. If that was the number one moves, the rub honey.

Speaker 5:          02:49:35       All right man. Yeah. You know, um, our friend bud, uh, his mom has cancer and she's been taking cannabis therapy for it and they attributed to a bunch of different things. But one of them being that she, she's stopped doing chemotherapy and it's at the same time she started doing this cannabis and her tumor shrunk by like 30 percent over a period of just a few weeks. They don't know if it was the combination of the chemotherapy and the cannabis oil, but they know that the cannabis oil has a big, big effect on it and I've been talking to so many people that know people with cancer that have also gone that route and have started taking cannabis oil that Rick Simpson oil and a bunch of different cbd oils. It's amazing. I'm hearing about that. You see that vice documentary on the measles virus and the HIV virus is incredible.

Speaker 5:          02:50:22       They're using the measles virus, an HIV virus to kill cancer and it's so far it's working. Ninety percent is amazing. We live in good times. Man decided to put that episode on Youtube for free so that their gift to the world that's showing the progress they've made. It seems like they've cured cancer. So it seems like. Well, if not, I mean there are certainly making giant leaps and bounds from where they were just a decade ago. Virus kills cancer. Not Crazy. It's nuts. Yeah. But you get really sick because they take you through it and when they gave him this, uh, this measles virus, they get really go into comas and it almost seems like they're going to die but never are going to die anyways with the cancer. And then they wake up from the coma and then they're cancer free. That's my man as we live in crazy times.

Speaker 5:          02:51:10       Man. What do you think that. This is the last question because we're almost out of time, right? Yeah. Five of us, five minutes left. Um, what do you think about performance enhancing drugs? Because that is a big issue with Jujitsu. You know, Steve Maxwell was just raving about it the other day. He's like, they need to do that in Jujitsu. There's too many guys that are on the news. What do you think? Yeah, because it's not in any sense. I mean, they have some light testing that they do for ib ggf, but it's like one of those situations again where like people know what to do, like they have enough, they have advanced notice of the event coming up. They know if they could be tested, whatever they pay after the event. Is that what it is after the event? Is it urine? Yeah, they test the randomly, like 10 dudes or something like that.

Speaker 5:          02:51:49       Oh, that's it. Yeah. It's something stupid. I mean it's a step in a direction. But um, yeah, I mean it's clearly a rampant um, you know, as to what to do about it. Like you either need to you, there's only two routes. There's one you just don't do anything. Okay. And then everybody has their option to use it or not use it, which, you know, whatever. I mean, you're obviously the people that choose not to, are going to suffer in terms of the disadvantage of not the strength. And then the other way to go about is you have to do it fucking right and just have random testing all the time and in a way where people can't fucking cheat it, you know what I mean? Because if, because if some camps get really, which is what happens in Oma, some camps get really, really good at figuring out what the ways are to cheat the tests or this, that, and the other thing.

Speaker 5:          02:52:31       And then other guys aren't gonna fucking go through that. I mean he gives those guys an advantage over the other guys that aren't, you know what I'm saying? Of course. So it's A. I mean, dude, I mean in a perfect world that's like, yeah, let's get rid of it. But it just seems like there's always, there's always a way to fucking hide it or always a way to do whatever. So I'm just gonna keep trying to get better at Jujitsu and you know, hopefully that saves me instead of bolting biceps, we'll see. Well, we've also seen a bunch of guys who were just two guys that got into mma and then got caught when they got into mma because then they get tested a little bit more thoroughly and assurance out. They were probably using it the entire time. Yeah, there's tons. There's tons of that for sure.

Speaker 5:          02:53:06       Jujitsu, man, whatever the case may be, you know, you think about this situation that MMA finds itself in. Right now I'm looking at an MMA, you know, as a future prospect, you know, getting involved in and you see all this, you know, all these guys are testing positive. It's kind of sneaky. Something that Ronda Rousey said was kind of interesting about the idea that like, oh, this isn't like baseball wherever, using steroids to hit a ball harder, we're using steroids and people are fucking getting knocked the fuck out. You know what I mean? And that's, that's scary, you know, and in a sense that people are getting stronger and stronger and have the ability to do serious damage to people, you know? So in that sense, yeah, it's, I mean, in a martial art, I think that's super dangerous, you know, um, I, you know, I don't know what the answer is, you know what I mean in terms of what they should do or whatever the case may be with a pds, but just because there's, and it's not even just steroids.

Speaker 5:          02:53:54       There's tons of other stuff people can be taken dpos and all different kinds of things, you know. Well, there was an article recently online where there were saying that these businessmen is middle aged businessmen have taken epo and winning cycling races just entering into amateur cycling races on Epo and winning them. And yeah, it just gives just such a giant advantage when you're dealing with someone who has some cycling, you are cycling, so you have the muscle strength and then all of a sudden you have this superhuman endurance. Yeah. So this is fucked. It's fucked. It's weird. It's weird that it's so many mma fighters are testing positive for it. Now. The epl world of Ali Baba routine off who fought for the title again. So my name, mouse Johnson, he tested positive for EPO. Shane Mosley tested positive for evo back in the day. If you think that's really, you know, you'd say, I mean people always say a large percentage of professional athletes are on steroids that Duh Duh. Do you think a large percentage of our on epl as well because cardio so huge. I know of many that have been on epo. I know of many that were on epo back in the day at least I know from the anecdotal stories that I've heard from people that trained with them that there was guys will take a wild west shoot epo or eat it. Good question. I think

Speaker 1:          02:55:04       they have a pill form now though. Yeah, I think so. I couldn't be wrong about that, but I think yeah, they've made major advances so they used to have to do like blood transfusions in order to do it properly. Yeah. Well there's still guys. I'm sure that blood dope. I'm sure they do that because there's no test for that. When you take your own blood out of your body, you make weight, your body has that blood regenerated in your body and then you add more blood to your body. You have more oxygen carrying capability. Take two weeks though for your body to make that blood. That's a good question. I don't know how long it takes, but guys could easily get a blood transfusion two weeks out. Matter of fact, that would give you plenty of time to recover if you want it to do that.

Speaker 1:          02:55:40       If you say, if you take Saturday and Sunday off, you know you train all week, you just say, okay, I'm going to get a blood transfusion Friday or a blood, a withdrawal, they're going to take my blood out Friday, you know you have the weekend to recover. You go back on Monday, you start training again and then they hold onto that blood for two weeks and then Jack that shit back in your system. You would most certainly have some sort of a performance advantage from that and I don't think they can detect that. I really don't. Yeah. That was what the bikers used to do. That was with all the cyclists used to do it. Yeah. It's, it's just, it's a fascinating time where people are learning more and more about how to cheat and then how to stop cheating. You know, like the shit that had hector lumbar got caught for.

Speaker 1:          02:56:21       I've never even heard of it before. She designer steroid. That was like really expensive exotic shit that it was that clear stuff that I'm very bonds and the victor connotate stuff where they thought that nobody knew how to detect it. Yeah. I don't know ma'am. Strictly. It's a very tricky, but Rhonda is point is as valid as fuck. It's a different thing. They're landing punches that you probably wouldn't be able to land. You're doing damage, especially when you're dealing with some sort of a war where one person surges and comes on at the end and stops that person. You know? That's probably a big part of it. Yep. Eddie Bravo. His feet are on the table. My time to end this fucking podcast chip as to eat your fucking heels. I just showered. Excuse me. This is where people eat and they drink coffee.
