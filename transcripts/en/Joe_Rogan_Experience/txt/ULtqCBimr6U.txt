Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Five, four, three, two, one. Gentlemen, thank you very much for being here. Really appreciate it. Dr Khan, uh, before we get started, why don't you tell everybody what your background is. Uh, you will be representing the Vegan portion of this discussion. Tell people about yourself a little bit.

Speaker 2:          00:00:22       Thank you. I feel like the head Broccoli in the United States today, but I am from motown, motor city, bad ass, uh, born and raised, University of Michigan School of Medicine, summa cum laude, internal medicine training, cardiology training in Dallas, Texas. Very hard to be Vegan in Dallas, but I did it in the eighties because I've been doing this 42 year Vegan 42 years and that's impressive. Age Eighteen and then a Kansas City, Missouri and another tough town to eat plants and only the steakhouse kc masterpiece. Did a training and stenting. I was blasting open heart attacks from 1990 on, came back to Michigan. Very active cath lab, heart attack. You're dead. I bring you back practice 24 hours a day with great partners. And about three to four years ago, I used all these decades of plant based medicine. I've been basically bringing my family up with and teaching patients, but it opened a completely preventive cardiology practice and along the way with my wife and son, we now own three plant based restaurants too, in Detroit. One in Austin, Texas, right books. Do TV, write blogs, teach, teach, teach, and that can stop them. One hundred 50 because there's a lot of erectile dysfunction. The stamp out. That's my passion that. Oh my God. What else? What better purpose in life?

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       Um, well we can, we can get to that. Heart disease is somewhere in that mix too. And uh, if people want to read more about you website is.

Speaker 2:          00:01:48       Yeah, Dr j o e l k a h n Dr Joel Kahn and you've written a ton of books, right? A bunch of medical papers, a whole lot of blogs. Awesome. And Chris? Yeah, Chris Kresser, demand

Speaker 3:          00:02:03       or Grad at uc Berkeley and then got a master's of science and I'm co director of the California Center for Functional Medicine, which is a functional medicine clinic and in here in California up in Berkeley. And, uh, I came to this from my own experience with chronic illness. I as, as you know, Joe got really sick, uh, back in my early twenties when I was traveling around the world and uh, you know, conventional medicine didn't have much to offer for me. And so that led me on a path of trying to figure out the best approach from a diet and behavior and lifestyle perspective to heal from my own chronic illness. And then that evolved into me starting to write, you know, it started a blog and a website and then, um, wrote a couple of books and now have a, an organization that trains practitioners in functional medicine and also trains health.

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       And you add one point in time. We're Vegan. I was a macrobiotic Vegan. I was apprenticing with a macrobiotic, a chef. So what's the difference? Eating macrobiotic Vegan for folks and irregular Vegan and macrobiotic is a particular philosophy. It's a particular approach that came from Japan and um, it's Vegan, but it's, it's, you know, it's heavily influenced by Japanese tradition and cuisine and it has some kind of different beliefs than us. A typical vegan approach, so I was uh, when I was originally studying Chinese medicine, I was working in an apprenticing with a macrobiotic Vegan chef and we were going around cooking for people who are really ill, often people with cancer who were following a macrobiotic diet. And before that I had been a vegetarian for quite a while as well. What, when I was traveling around the world and got sick. Actually I was, I was vegetarian at that point too.

Speaker 3:          00:03:55       And you discovered through your own personal. We do it over there, buddy. You discovered over there through your own personal practice that you, your body worked better and your illnesses went away when you changed your diet away from macrobiotic? Yeah. For me personally, I'm vegetarian diet and particularly Vegan diet was a disaster, but I'm just one person. I don't put a lot of stock into a single person's experience one way or the other, but certainly that did lead me down the path of questioning some of my earlier beliefs that I had about vegetarianism and veganism and it led me to make some different choices and that is important to discuss here that everybody's body really is different, different people's bodies and lifestyles. They're going to have different requirements. Absolutely. I mean, I, I would say, just to start off this whole discussion, if we're trying to answer the question, what's the optimal diet for everyone? I think that's a terrible question and it's an unanswerable question, uh, where we share a lot in common as human beings, but we have a lot of important differences to. And from the beginning I've always argued that there's no one size fits all approach when it comes to diet. Um, but I think there are some common themes and we can. I'm sure we'll get to those later. Yeah, I think that's really important, right? It's really, it's really important to discuss that people really do have different requirements.

Speaker 4:          00:05:23       Yeah. And I mean, we'll get into the mud a little bit as we need to, but we also, Chris and I share a lot in common. I mean, one, if we ate together, it would probably be 90 percent the same. We both are really respectful of what we call functional medicine, root cause medicine. I don't write scripts without thinking about the patient. He certainly doesn't do that without thinking about the entire patient is pretty unusual. And we are going to represent a very small section. I, I honor what he's doing with his new book, unconventional medicine. The rest. Yeah. That is what is happening throughout medicine. Um, and it's necessary because it just, we're just running out of dollars in and health when we're just pushing and not even

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       asking the person what they eat, how they sleep, you know, the whole thing, you know, we're real people. Yeah. We know that. We don't agree on this, but it's still rare jewel. I mean this is to have, you know, this is pretty rare segment. I don't know that two percent of the people in America will have a patient leaves the office and actually ask what they

Speaker 5:          00:06:14       today, you know? Yeah. I mean, it doesn't happen. Let me say one more thing about this though, because I think you hit on a really important point and I'm glad you did. Did it right off the bat. The biggest problem with nutritional research epidemiology is that it starts with the assumption that there is one diet for everybody. That's, that's something that's rarely discussed, but it's, it's this idea that, you know, should everyone be on a low carb diet, should everyone be on a high carb, you know, low fat or a low fat diet, you know, should everyone do this? Should everyone do that? And the whole, um, you know, there's a guy in Australia, professor who calls calls this approach nutritionism this idea that we can reduce foods down into these individual components just like macronutrients, protein, fat, carbohydrates, and we can figure out what works best for everyone just by looking at these isolated components without considering the, the whole context of the Diet.

Speaker 5:          00:07:14       So I think, you know, Joel would agree that if you talk about a diet that's 50 percent calories and fat and one diet is they're getting all of those fat calories from pizza and chips and candy bars and things like that, and then another diet, they're getting 50 percent of fat from Avocados and olive oil and uh, even, you know, eggs and animal foods, those are two totally different diets. And yet in the scientific literature, those are equated as the same because they're, all they're looking at is the calories from fat. They're not considering the quality of the Diet

Speaker 2:          00:07:46       and others add in, and again, we'd go anywhere with this conversation, but a lot of the problem has been imprecision of language. So even the word low carb diet, I had a low carb diet. If we talk low refined carbs, I don't eat white flour, I don't eat sugar. A very careful about all those components. I eat a very high complex carbohydrate diet. So we'll vegetables. A giant study that's been released this years appear study, talks about carbs in the Diet. They didn't differentiate complex and refined very hard to know what to do with data that doesn't spread that apart. And in your own life, I mean low fat, high fat. I mean we need to talk about, is it soybean oil that's processed and rancid? Are we talking about Avocados and uh, you know, healthy whole foods. So the precision of language, even protein protein.

Speaker 2:          00:08:31       The big divide is animal versus plant. So anytime that word comes up we need to differentiate what w know, be precise and then will help more people if we're precise. Yeah. And if you can just to eliminate this for people. What is the problem with epidemiology studies? Boy, you know, I'll, I'll go there real quick. I mean, I don't think there's a problem, but there are a part of the solution. They're not the whole solution. A lot scientists, I'll give a shout out to Los Angeles, brightest nutrition mine, somebody that I know, Chris Honors to Valter Longo, no label and that Vegan that Pailin that nothing. He's at USC, been honored by the Royal Academy of Swedish medicine, which is a Nobel prize committee in this. Now. He says, you know, you do basic science and then you do an epidemiology study to test the hypothesis. You've seen something in a petri dish, you see something in a mouse, you see something in a cell, you asked the question, is animal protein prolongevity pro early aging, explaining epidemiologists study people.

Speaker 2:          00:09:29       So you would take that concept. I'll just run with that, that you know, you, um, you look at a, uh, an amino acid found in animal protein thrown out. Matthias and Lucy in a petri dish looks like it might cause accelerated aging in a single cell. That's about chemistry. That is something you honor, but it's a long jump from there to a human. Then you look at a database. Sometimes it's a crappy old database. Sometimes it's Harvard has these gigantic ongoing database. A Loma Linda an hour from here has a gigantic database and there's others that epic study, this pure study I mentioned, you can test a hypothesis of what happens if our data may be crappy, but it's still data and it allows you to go further with 100,000 people. 50,000 people, 500,000 people. Can we, do we have the data? Ask the question, does protein correlate with survival protein correlate with early death, animal protein, plant protein?

Speaker 2:          00:10:17       These studies had been coming out a lot lately and they let you parse it out. Now it's what Chris talks about. Do you know everything about the person in the database? Do you know smoke or do you know diabetes or they go to the gym to lift weights. They smoke dope and smoke crack. You know you don't know everything. Nowadays. Most of these things are going to ask, are your blood pressure, cholesterol, all the basics to try and take those factors away and isolate the question you're asking. It will be imperfect and then you go to the best study, but it won't. It won't happen often. The randomized clinical trial, I mean, there's never been a randomized clinical trial smoking [inaudible] that'd be unethical. You're never going to do it. It was epidemiology that proved and association strong enough to recommend to the public don't smoke.

Speaker 2:          00:10:58       They'll never be a randomized trial and that everything, parachutes don't need a randomized trial, you know, um, you know, taking folic acid and a pregnant woman to not have spinal Bifida doesn't need a randomized trial. I mean there's some things that are so pressing. The public health can't allow that and there's even more than that. The last little section is, um, you can study old people. Chris enjoys studying ancient societies. I enjoy studying the elderly in current, you know, modern environment, which is called the blue zones and there's others. But you know, what old people do, the old healthy people. Well, we would like to be, would you like to be 90 and have your brains and have your joints and everything working well, we have that database so that little for a pod, a pedestal, the sit on basic epidemiology, randomized studies and centenarian studies allows you to make reasonable conclusions will be wrong. Some things we're not going to be very long, Chris. I think there's huge problems with epidemiology.

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       So obser, epidemiology, observational studies are studies that look at a certain group of people and then try to draw inferences from their behavior about associations with disease. So let's say we take a group and we look and see, you know, how much saturated fat are they eating? And we separate them into, you know, low consumption, medium consumption, high consumption, and in a prospective study where we're watching them over time, we might then look 20 years later and see how many people had heart attacks and died. Okay. And then we try to correlate that with their amount of saturated fat intake. Now I actually just published two articles with. I'm going in detail on the problems with observational nutritional research and um, you can find them at [inaudible] dot com slash Rogan. There's a whole bunch of information that we're going to be talking about today there so people can go and get the details themselves.

Speaker 5:          00:12:50       But I'll just give you three of the, I think the most, the worst problems with nutritional epidemiology. The first is data collection. So there's a saying in science, which is that data are only as good as the as the tool used to collect them. All right? And in nutritional observational studies, the tool used to collect data is a questionnaire. Okay? And so that relies completely on memory and we know that memory is not a precise, accurate or literal representation of events. It's more like a highly edited anecdote of what happened in the past and back a little bit like the cavenaugh thing. Go now, back in the bag in the 13th century you had Francis Bacon. He said, for something to be scientific it has to be independently observable, measurable and falsifiable, and then accurate and valid, valid. And so let's use an analogy. If you're sitting there eating an apple and I'm watching you do that, I can observe that you're eating the apple.

Speaker 5:          00:13:50       I can measure how much of the apple you eat and I can confirm or refute that you're eating the apple. If you tell me that you were eating an apple 15 years ago or 10 years ago, I obviously can observe that. I obviously can't measure it and I obviously can't confirm or refute it and yet our entire foundation of nutritional epidemiology is based on that. Basically people reporting on what they ate at some time in the past, so you know how much of a problem is this. A. There's a guy named Edward Archer who's done some really interesting studies and he looked at the end Haynes data, the nurses' health data, which is one of the longest running nutrition studies, 39 years, and he found that the self reported calorie intake in those studies was either physiologically implausible or incompatible with life, so the average person in those studies reported a calorie intake that would not support an elderly bedridden frail woman, so they just.

Speaker 5:          00:14:54       It's just inaccurate. It's completely inaccurate and the people who are most likely to under report or people who are overweight and obese, so if you if calories or that much under reported, all nutrition comes through calories. Everything. We get fat, protein, carbohydrates, micronutrients. They all come through calories, so calories or that underreported, that completely invalidates the Dataset. This is an obesity study, so the there are under reported because of Shannon on an obesity study. It's just every Americans are overweight and obese. The majority of Americans are overweight and obese, so in any data set of Americans are going to have the majority of them overweight or obese or are obese. So that's the first problem. The second problem is the healthy user bias, which I know we talked about before, but it's basically the idea that because you know when someone engages in an unhealthy and a behavior that's perceived as unhealthy, they are more likely to engage in other behaviors that are perceived as unhealthy and vice versa.

Speaker 5:          00:15:53       So let's say you do a study of people who ate eat more red meat. Red Meat has been perceived as unhealthy for a long time, and so what we know is that in those observational studies, that people who eat more red meat are also smoking more. They have higher body mass index. They're eating less, fewer fruits and vegetables. They have a lower level of education. They're less physically active. So how do you know that it's the red meat that's causing the problem and not those other things you don't because they cannot control for all of those potential confounding factors. The third problem with observational research, and maybe the biggest is that the the relative risks in nutrition are so low that they're indistinguishable from chance. So in fields outside of nutrition and epidemiology, nobody would consider a relative risk an increase in risk less than 100 percent.

Speaker 5:          00:16:47       A doubling to be really worth paying attention to. So to put this in perspective, the observational studies that Joel was referring to that confirmed that is that cigarette smoking led to lung cancer that showed in between a 1000 and 3000 percent increase in lung cancer in smokers. Okay. And the studies that have shown that eating aflatoxin, which is a mycotoxin increased liver cancer risk, that's 600 percent increase. Okay. The AIA, the I a arc, the WHO report that suggested that process, red meat was a carcinogen. That was 18 percent increase. Most epidemiologists you've talked to will say that is so low that it's really interesting. Indistinguishable from chance, especially given the healthy user bias and the problems with the data collection that I mentioned before. So the studies that are cited, so when people are talking about red meat causes cancer, they're literally talking about something that showed an 18 percent increase.

Speaker 5:          00:17:51       Yeah. And this is over a depot that are also consuming sugar. That translates into four and a half. There were four and a half cases of cancer out of 100 and people with no lowest intake of processed meat. And that went up to five point three cases out of 100 and people with the highest intake of processed meat. So, you know, there are quotes like if you, if you look even 20 years ago, like there's an article in science, um, the journal Science and Marsha Anjell who was the former editor of New England Journal of Medicine, was quoted as saying we wouldn't even accept a paper for publication if it didn't have at least a 200 percent increase, especially if it was a new association or the, the, the biological mechanism wasn't known. And here we are today saying that you know, this increase that by seven percent or by 10 percent and when you consider that the data is usually questionnaires of what people ate and all of these confounding factors like exercise and and fruit and vegetable consumption and things like that are not accounted for.

Speaker 5:          00:18:58       Then we're really just playing games with numbers as part of the problem as well, that there's this clickbait culture now in terms of journalism where they just want to publish something that says eight study shows, 18 percent of people eat red meat, get cancer. That's a huge problem. And there is a study that was done that showed that 43 percent of findings came from observational studies were portrayed in the media as being causal, which, which any epidemiologists would tell you that that's a full pot. You can't do that, but nobody is going to click on a headline that says, you know, small association between these two variables scene, we don't know what it means, but please read the stories.

Speaker 4:          00:19:45       Interesting. Let me just grab a couple and again, a lot of respect and agreement. But if we throw a bid deem ecology away, we thrown away about 80 percent of nutrition knowledge because that is the most common kind of study and that still leaves us with basic science, which is rockin. It leaves us with a randomized clinical trials which are very hard nutrition and they're very expensive and there's less than we need. And if finally leaves us with the studying old healthy people centenarian studies, but does go to Loma Linda 10 times more people in Loma Linda are over 100 than there are in Los Angeles 10 times more. That's by definition. Yeah, it's called the blue zone. And we'll talk about blue zone. But that was discovered in the 19 fifties. If you lived in Loma Linda, you were living 12. Some of those an hour east of here.

Speaker 4:          00:20:26       It's what's going on with the center of the seventh day adventist church, which teaches people eat your veggies, don't drink, don't smoke and exercise. So it's an amazing lifestyle oriented, uh, aspect of the Christian church. And they in 1958 got huge funding from the government to explore. Why the heck are they live in 12 years, eight years, 10 years longer, and they've parsed that out and probably a thousand publications there. It's not a randomized study, you know, it was an la versus Loma Linda will feed you different diets and fought. Won't ever happen, but it is a reliable longterm peer review. This stuff's published, the finest of journals and it at least lets you ask questions. I mean why is there a 104 year old cardiac surgeon, Elliot wore sham walking around doing his gardening and he just finished operating on a heart patients. I mean, it's insane for a award.

Speaker 4:          00:21:12       Show him love you buddy. So let me go back for a minute. If we throw epidemiology out, we are left with basically. No, I know, but so food. This is all technical stuff and but you've got a sophisticated audience. Food frequency questionnaires with Chris said is the source of a lot of these epidemiologists states you fill out a four page, a 40 page at in Loma Linda to 58 page survey, but you do it once. That's called the pure study. The headlines. You've seen them, cheese, eggs, meat, or good for your heart. It's been the news the last two weeks that comes from a giant international study. They did one food frequency questionnaire at the beginning. Twelve years later, the reporting that data, it's all click bait headlines. It's like you say, people love to see this stuff, so if we throw out some studies, we have to throw out the largest nutritional study that's been reported and the most recent one that's getting all the headlines.

Speaker 4:          00:22:02       It's got to be played fair. Now you go to Loma Linda. It's every four years. They're asking you go to Harvard school public health every four years they update the data, so if you change your diet, that's the weakness. You fill out the survey and then you get healthy or you get sick and you make changes and then they're counting of your debt or lie. Well, it might be what you did. Your six now what you filled out year one, so there are. There are better and worse forms. The second I'd say healthy user bias is the idea that people pick a certain diet might have other lifestyles. It might be as or more important. It's going to be true of the Paleo Group. I mean, these guys are gonna. Look at Chris. He looks wonderful. He Se thin. He's not the obese American, the 75 percent that are overweight and obese. I mean that's true in the plant community to some extent. We have Chubby vegans like there's no observational studies with significant number of Paleo dieters too. I know. I know that a healthy user bias is not an issue for Leo, but if you don't have data doesn't mean. I mean you don't have data because it's a new movement that hasn't had the data, but it's not the cast stones that plant based Cedars go to the gym more. It's probably true. We don't know, but. And that's a third thing to stop you for a second. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:23:06       Mediators do get lumped in with the Paleo group. They consider Paleo group part of the meat eater group. Like when people talk about these epidemiologic. Yeah. Epidemiology studies where they show that people that consume red meat more likely to get sick on my leg to cancer. They're not referring to Paleo diet or consider eating avocado and grass fed.

Speaker 4:          00:23:26       You gotta. Remember, most of the Paleo movement is the last dozen, 15 years, you know, we can talk about that in 1985, 2000 to Loren cordain publishers book in 2002. The book didn't sell, republished 2010. It took off. This is a relatively new moment, so if you filled out the study and Loma Linda in 1958, you don't have to worry. There weren't too many people following a classic Paleo Diet. This also true at Harvard, these initiatives, the last is just a relative risk. That's what we call it. These are pure statistics. I'm a, I'm a heart attack, not a statistician, but there are some exceptions. I mean anybody, and I'll just say I've got a red button on my website that says Rogan references because I thought it would be good to have people a place to go, just like Chris mentioned, and I'm not massaging the data.

Speaker 4:          00:24:07       It's scientific peer reviewed data. Um, there was a study in October, 2016, October one, 2016 songs from Harvard, 6,000 people observational data, animal protein, plant protein. They actually let me go to 2014. Morgan Levine, this is an amazing Harvard researcher, beautiful woman, Morgan Levine. She looked at 6,000 people prospectively, observation, fill out all these data. If you were an animal protein eater that's called meat, you had a three to 400 percent increase in cancer risk. Three to 400 percent. That's three to four times isn't one point one, one point. Oh, eight, 18 percent. The data's there. This is peer reviewed data. If you ate plant based proteins, risk of cancer goes down. This is in the highest pause for a second. I just want to say there are nutritional data that are powerful, but this is also an epidemiology study. That's where 18 in a, nobody's going to do a randomized study of 6,000 people. You eat beans, you eat

Speaker 5:          00:25:04       this. And I think I have a, a good example that can clear some of this. Uh, so, um, you mentioned the Loma Linda and the seventh day adventist studies. So, um, first of all, let me just make a comment about observational nutritional research. It can, there are good observational studies in there, bad ones you can design an observational study in a way that controls for some of these potentially confounding factors like the healthy user bias, et cetera. So, but this is a story that will, I think clear some of this up. So there are about eight studies, major studies that have compared lifespan and in a vegetarians and vegans and omnivores. So the earlier studies are three studies that were seventh day adventist studies, so they were done in the seventh day adventist community, which Joel mentioned. Is it religious group that has as part of its credo, you know, a healthy lifestyle diet and lifestyle.

Speaker 5:          00:25:59       Um, yeah, by 20, 20 million people, let's not talk over each other. Let's just make sure we catch a vegetarian vegetarian diet, but also, you know, eat a live healthy fruits and vegetables, don't smoke, don't drink excessively, etc. So you know, health conscious group of people and the the, the, the first one on the seventh day adventist study in the Netherlands, compared them with the general population, which is just garbage because of the healthy user bias so we can just cross that one off the list. The two Seventh day adventist studies that were done in loma linda and the us, they did a better job because they compared people who do eat meat amongst the seventh day adventist population with people who don't and was a slight advantage in lifespan and in the vegetarians versus the mediators. But one of those studies didn't control for smoking and body mass index.

Speaker 5:          00:26:52       So that data is highly suspect. And the other study did and there was a slight advantage since then. There have been four studies that I think did a much better job. So this is kind of an interesting design. So they said let's try to find a group of more health conscious omnivores to compare these vegetarians against. So they. The first one was called the health food shopper study. So they looked at people who shopped at health food stores. When the idea is people who shopped at health food stores are going to be generally more health conscious and they found health food store, you mean like a whole foods or I. There was no whole foods at this point, but that was the idea. Right. And so that study found that both groups, vegetarians and omnivores who shopped at health food stores had us hugely reduced risk of death compared to the general population, but there was no difference between vegetarians and omnivores.

Speaker 5:          00:27:41       Second study, oxford vegetarian study in the uk, they recruited people buy first they recruited vegetarians and then they asked the vegetarians to ask their friends who also ate meat so that the idea was the people that are vegetarians were hanging out with, might be more health conscious than the general population. Same result, big difference in the, in, in life span between those two groups in the general population, but no difference between vegetarians and omnivores. Epic oxford cohort. Same thing, same way of recruiting people. Same result, big difference, uh, between the two groups in the omnivores, but no difference between vegetarians and omnivores. And then the heidelberg study was in the in Germany and in a similar way, I think they recruited people who read vegetarian magazines and then they asked them to bring their friends or family members who ate meat. Big difference in lifespan between the two groups and general population, no difference between vegetarians and omnivores.

Speaker 5:          00:28:37       And then you had the 45 and up study that was recently done in Australia. This was a little different because they didn't set out to find, you know, more health conscious people. Instead they looked at 250,000 people, big sample size and they did a much better job of controlling for all of the various factors that might affect the results. So exercise, physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, cigarette smoking, alcohol education level because we know that has a big impact on lifespan and they found that there was no difference in lifespan between omnivores and vegetarians in that study as well. And then there've been two meta analysis of all of the studies that have looked at this. Both meta analysis found no difference between vegetarians and omnivores in total in lifespan. So I think this is a really good example of what we're talkiNg about here. that's all observational data, so we're not throwing it out or saying we should throw it out, but all of those studies did a better job at dealing with the potential pitfalls of observational studies. And when they did that they found no

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       difference. So, and I want to point out that it, those ways of picking more health conscious omnivores were they still weren't comparing like someone on a paleo type of diet with a vegetarian. They were just guessing that someone who shopped at a health food store was at least a little more conscious about health in the general population. So quick little cleanup. Quick, quick, quick. Luckily I just want to go back for a minute to meet in cancer. World health organization is not a vegan group. It's not enough in group now. It's a fairly well respected international organization that puts out health claims. So although I absolutely chris had the data right, 18 percent increase in cancer risk with process red meat. I want to make that clear. I hope you don't eat too many hot dogs. Lie me, bologna, pepperoni. That's the uh, well, it may be more than nature, but it's just a hallway.

Speaker 4:          00:30:30       It's assault. That's a preservatives. It's junky pieces of the animal that they're putting into a hot dog. That was a group that's an 18 percent increase. You can go forward and a half percent of five and a half percent. That's still 50 to 60,000 people a year. They get colon cancer. If that data's right, they wouldn't get colon cancer if they just would stop eating hot hotdogs at a minimum. And I know chris will agree. Frigging hospitals are serving hot dogs and the data's out there that it promotes cancer to people getting chemotherapy with the ivy pool. It's insanity. So 50,000 people avoid colorectal cancer with small differences that the world health organization suggests it was 800 papers in 22 world experts. There is no perfect study, but when they announced it, October 25th, 2015, the world was shocked. You just said that process red meat causes cancer.

Speaker 4:          00:31:13       They didn't say related. They were strong enough data to say cause they've been beat up. They publish more data. They haven't backed down, I just want to put that out. The healthy user bias will exist in the paleo community when the study's done because they may look at paleo effects there. It's everything and I honored that. I mean we should promote healthy lifestyle foods. Only one part of this. I mean we will all at this table live longer than the average american. We're not smoking two packs a day. We don't have 38 inch waist lines. The whole deal. We're doing the whole thing. Hopefully you guys are enjoying a little cabernet now and then or a that's always on the list. Just don't overdo it, but the healthy user bias, that particular that health food study paper with 1996, it's pretty old paper in the paper in the limitations.

Speaker 4:          00:31:52       They beat themselves up. we were missing this or that. Anybody just read the paper. It's not that it doesn't bring up an interesting point, but to say that we again throw away all these papers cause they are biased it. Lastly, and I'm done multivariate analysis. Chris was just talking about better studies that factor all this stuff. Let's not bore your audience was statistics statistics, but there's certainly the ability now to say, does animal protein associated with an increased risk of cancer and put in smoking and weight and diabetes and blood pressure and vegetable intake and alcohol intake and family history, and then you just isolate the one thing is their foibles. Are There downsides? Of course, but all modern epidemiology does multivariate analysis to try and isolate it. You know, you can cast stones everywhere, but you know there are the, you know, the world health organization mean there's 21. Organizations

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       say limit your saturated fat in your diet and none that are international society say increase at soap, you put it. Nutrition science needs incorporate as much as you can with as much reliability and at the end of the day you can see we'll still have questions, but I can't threaten us. Used to say don't eat much cholesterol. Now they don't. They used to say limit your total fat and now they don't. It's wrong because they've gone out is wrong. actually, the usta says in the guideline, eat as little cholesterol is not a nutrient of concern because they couldn't identify the exact milligrams to recommend. Used to be 300. The science doesn't support it's emitting dietary cholesterol anymore. Let me go back to the the limit cholesterol. Limit cholesterol to as little as possible. I mean, what's this thing? Who is the usda? Usda, usda. The guidelines come out every five years and they are in used for school menus and hospital menus.

Speaker 5:          00:33:35       it was a big buzz in 2016 was announced. They no Longer were giving a so many miLligrams of cholesterol day. You'd never exceed. They said, we can't pick the number. Usd a behind the cUrve in termS of a little bit influential. Total mortality is the most important end point we should be talking about here. That means deaths from any cause. Okay, so if, because that's what we care about most, right? If, if I die of a, you know, if, if I, if an intervention reduces the risk of a heart attack but increases the risk of cancer, I'm not happy with that. In fact, I'd rather go out, have a heart attack, and so you need to consider a total mortality and if something, you know, if meat increases the risk of cancer and cancer mortality, then why aren't we seeing that in the studies that compared lifespan with vegetarians and omnivores?

Speaker 5:          00:34:27       We have, as I said, we have a five studies that did a better job of controlling for that healthy user bias and there was no difference in any of those studies. There is not a single study that showed that compared relatively equivalent groups of people that shows that vegetarians or vegans have a lifespan advantage period. There is not. And so if you know red meat isn't. If we're saying red meat, processed meat increases the risk of cancer by 18 percent, maybe, maybe not, but that's not showing up in any of the total. The total mortality data. The second thing, and this is a really good example of what we talked about, the very beginning of the show context is everything. Quality is more important than quantity. So let's talk. Let's think about processed meat. So there's several proposed mechanisms for how processed meat causes cancer.

Speaker 5:          00:35:13       One is that it increases and nitros, so compounds or [inaudible], which damage damage, the gut lining, and others that, uh, they, when you cook meat at a high temperatures, at forums, heterocyclic, any means or hcas which damaged the gut. Another is that the heme iron content in meat causes oxidative stress and increases the risk of cancer that way. And then there's and new five gc. But let me just give you a few examples of why context is important. So there's evidence that chlorophyll rich green vegetables prevent myoglobin from being turned into end nitros. So compound. So if you're eating processed meat but you're also eating kale and broccoli, then it's not going to have the same effect on the body as if you're just eating a hot dog. I'm cruciferous vegetables and spices and marinades have been shown to reduce the formation of heterocyclic amines or hta.

Speaker 5:          00:36:09       So same thing if you're, if you're marinating meat or if you're eating broccoli and cruciferous vegetables with meat, it's not going to have the same impact. There are several studies have shown that eating fruits and vegetables attenuates the oxidative capacity of heme iron and even reduces the absorption of heme iron in the gut. And, uh, you know, dietary antioxidants have been shown to reduce the risk of gastric cancer. So heme iron intake, really you can think of it as a proxy for a crappy diet. In these observational studies, there was a quote from a study that did find a relationship with heme iron and cardiovascular disease and the but the study, the study author himself said, with respect to heme iron intake, we found a significant association only in the studies that were based on american cohorts. They didn't find an association than the Netherlands, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, and Sweden, which suggests that it's because of the standard crappy american diet.

Speaker 5:          00:37:08       You know, most people are eating processed meat in, in the us are eating it in the form of hot dogs and all kinds of other unhealthy foods. Sugar. And it's another example of how that user. But I'm not saying I'm open to the possibility that too much processed meat can be problematic, but you have to consider the context. It's not going to have the same effect if someone's eating a ton of fruits and vegetables versus someone who's on a standard american diet and we have no studies that separate that out. Okay. I think we have a gong moment because I really want your listeners to come away with a few tips from chris and I that make a difference because I know your listeners aren't going to stop eating meat at the end of the show. They might. Chris just said meat with vegetables is safer. The meat without vegetables.

Speaker 5:          00:37:52       Meat with chlorophyll is safe for the meat without. I can give you a cardiac study. Said, agree. I. I teach process me. Well, it's all made. I teach the same. No. Listen, we agree here. I want people to hear this, but doing. When you grill, how many people in the audience grill barbecue? Everybody. If you grill meat, another chemical group that's formed are called advanced glycation end products. Age to go along with the list, but if you grill meat that's marinated and this was the tip in dark beer, this is science randomized science. You put a piece of beef in dark beer and your grill it. You don't create as many of these toxic chemicals as a dry piece of beef. So let's. Let's like right now everybody listening, next time you eat meat, get a salad. Next time we meet order broccoli. Next time you have get a

Speaker 4:          00:38:35       get a, you know, slice tomatoes, you will actually improve your health. There's this classic announced shift into cardiology that they took a healthy volunteers and they took them down to the hospital cafeteria and they fed them a hospital burger and they were measuring on their arm how there are arteries function, cardiology topic, artery function goes down in three hours. We needed a hospital Burger. It x like you just had a toxin in your body. You did. They took the same group. A week later they had them meet the same burger with a big salad. They didn't see that finding. I mean, I want this to be an important point and every body should be jamming fruits and vegetables or at least the vegetables with some fruits. You can go low glycaemic berries. I'm fine with papayas, cantaloupe, and apples, but you know up your veggies listeners and you'll counteract lot of the crap that's out there in the world and it's an important message.

Speaker 4:          00:39:22       I don't disagree with that. No, you wouldn't. You have to. We'd glossed over this very quickly in the beginning of this, but there was a dispute about cholesterol and a dispute about saturated fat. Ah, sears. You were saying that saturated fat, that there's recommendations to reduce saturated fat and reduced cholesterol. So let, let me go real quick overview and I'm going to talk fast. So just normal. Yeah, it was plenty of time. It was felt so until the forties. It was not common to have a heart attack. Heart attacks were described in 1916. Not to say that didn't happen, but the first medical article that used the word myocardial infarction 19, 16, 1940. There were not many heart attacks seen in a modern american city. After world war two, we are economy went up in the city of minneapolis. Executives started suffering heart attacks. It was also franklin delano roosevelt died of high blood pressure.

Speaker 4:          00:40:13       A few years later, eisenhower had a massive heart attack. That's when our government, national institutes of health started funneling major money into studies like the framingham study or from newton framingham's, the city outside of boston, and they basically invaded this town in 1958. Today is that we're spending money. We're going to figure this crap out. The idea had come up. Heart disease wasn't just aging. Heart disease could be explained by what's called risk factors. Smoking might not. You can smoke and live to a hundred, but it's going to increase your risk and then the gun to blood pressure and cholesterol and a family history. They identified what we call risk factors, so until that point, diet was not considered a factor in the development. The number one killer of men and women I want to point out, and chris puts this on his website. I do too. During this interview, every 39 seconds and american dies of heart disease every 39 second most frequent cause of death, so there will be about 200 people perhaps that will die during this podcast.

Speaker 4:          00:41:08       The number one killer and 80 percent of it's preventable. Chris is going to prevent some. I'm going to prevent some because the biggest enemy out there smoking and crap, diet, calorie rich and processed foods, crap, sad diet, standard american diet. It becAme apparent in the early 19 fifties diet might play a role and a notorious scientists and many others. His name dr. Ancil keys, phd, phd at two of them suggested dietary fat might be a factor. It was a hypothesis. It says early stage epidemiology doesn't prove anything. He went out and did studies. Other people went out and did studies and the idea of transitioned actually he was criticized for saying dietary fat. That is the conversation transition. There's some good fats like omega three fatty acids are essential. You have to have them, and then maybe polyunsaturated fats from plants are more helpful, but the focus went on saturated fat in food, which is bacon, chicken, red meat, pizza.

Speaker 4:          00:42:05       Those are the highest sources. And, um, subsequently enough data accumulated. That guideline started to suggest we've got this huge problem with heart disease. We should limit saturated fat in the diet. It was never limit off that 35 percent of calories that's not in anybody's word, a low fat diet. Um, and that has now promulgated in 21 international statements, there is no opposite whether it's a world health organization, the american heart association, american college of cardiology, whether it's an institute of institute of medicine, says eat as little saturated fat as possible. They couldn't be more clear. And these are high brow. These are not associated with vegan movements or paleo movements or whatever. These are medical authorities. If there was half and half, you'd say controversy, 21 to 21 say the same thing, they might pick a different cutoff point, but we will enhance the health and cut down the number one killer, whether it's in asia, whether the job, whether it's Australia, whether it's a in the United States, there's unanimity in why did they come to the basic science?

Speaker 4:          00:43:03       Because there is basic science and let me tell you that when you eat foods rich and saturated fat, which is called meat, cheese, eggs, and such receptors on your liver for cholesterol, I've got cholesterol, my blood, I'd like to get some of it out into the liver to be metabolized. I need a receptor. You eat saturated fats. Receptors go down. Cholesterol has no place to go. Cholesterol stays In the blood, bumps into your artery wall. I'm putting a stent in yardi. That's the basic biochemistry. Then they had epidemiology studies, flawed. Perfect. It doesn't matter. There was. Whoa, chris, chris, thank you very much. Then they did controlled trials. Three. Everybody just go read clark. Nineteen 97 slash 395. It's called metabolic studies, changed the diet. See what happens. You add saturated fat, cholesterol skyrockets on average, not in a single person. If I give you a state christmas taken mistake, our cluster would rise differently.

Speaker 4:          00:43:53       It would rise. It would rise differently. It's our microbiome, it's our genetics. It would rise, so it. That's a problem in the studies when you average everything together. So they had that and then finally, finally they looked at populations that live over 100. These are called the pillars of longevity. They don't eat foods rich in saturated fat. They have a little, they don't have a lot. They eat a lot of olive oil in Italy and Greece. They eat almost no dietary fat in okinawa, Japan and they live. They have the greatest longevity in the world. In 1970, they almost no dietary fat. About six, seven percent. Okay. All right. Well no, it'S actually. That is the basis for a major push to say cut back on animal products

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       because that's largely with the exception of coconut and palm. We're saturated fat comes from so that to tiffany gate, that is to throw out every major health agency in the world. And I don't believe chris kresser can do that. No disrespect. I don't think chris can throw out a hundred years of cluster. Let's back up a little bit here. Yeah. So, um, first of all, every food that we consume has all of the fats in it, polyunsaturated, monounsaturated and saturated fat. And in fact, two tablespoons of olive oil has more saturated fat than a seven ounce pork chop. That's a little known fact. The oily fish macro, which all of these health agencies that joel was talking about advises us to eat, has twice the total fat in one and a half times the saturated fat that we're of the meat that we're told to avoid. Um, does it make sense that nature would include the, that you could eat a macro and the polyunsaturated fats in it are good for you, but the saturated fat in it is bad for you.

Speaker 5:          00:45:33       That'S kind of nonsensical. But you know, let's talk a little bit more about the research. So there never really was good evidence to suggest that dietary cholesterol and saturated fat are connected to heart disease. And zoe heart comb, who's a, has a phd in nutritional researcher, she wrote her thesis, her phd thesis on the evidence back in the seventies that led to the restrictions on a saturated fat and cholesterol. And then she also reviewed the evidence. You're all the way up until the 2016. And, and if, uh, I have this information on my website, if you go to [inaudible] dot com slash rogan, you can find it and what you'll find is there never was in really good evidence to support the limitations on die on saturated fat and cholesterol. And people have started to look at this more recently. And uh, for example, you have a meta analysis of observational studies including about 350,000 participants recently that found no relationship between saturated fat intake and cardiovascular disease.

Speaker 5:          00:46:43       You have an exhaustive review of studies, something like 25 randomized controlled trials, gold standard of clinical evidence. And it's almost 40 observational studies involving 650,000 participants. And I'll read you a quote from the conclusion, current evidence does not clearly support cardiovascular guidelines that encourage high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids and low consumption of saturated fatty acids. Now, look, one of my favorite quotes is the philosopher anatoly France, even a $50 million people say a foolish thing. It's still a foolish thing. And the other thing to consider is that the history of science is really the history of most scientists being wrong about most things most of the time. and, uh, you know, in science we have to continually challenge our hypotheses and try to falsify them. And that'S how the scientific process moves forward. And that's why in 2010, theu , s federal government removed restrictions on total fat.

Speaker 5:          00:47:44       Whereas before There was a restriction on total fat because they, they acknowledged that the research was showing that not all fat is the same and that, you know, we don't need to be restricting fat from avocados and things like that. And in 2015, they removed the restriction on dietary cholesterol. Now they did that fairly quietly because how do you think it looks when people have been told to limit their fat and limit their cholesterol and then the federal agency goes back on that, that recommendation after so many years of telling people to do that, people lose faith in the agencies that are, that are issuing these guidelines and don't take it for me. you know, I'm, I'm, I'm not expecting anyone to believe me, and that's why I put all of the studies and the research supporting this at [inaudible] dot com slash rogan, but how about johnny enedis, who's one of the most renowned epidemiologists in the world?

Speaker 5:          00:48:38       He's a professor of medicine at stanford and he has wrote some written, some scathing critiques of nutritional research recently that had been published in jama and british medical journal. So here's a quote from one of them, some nutrition scientist and much of the public often consider epidemiological associations of nutritional factors to represent causal effects that can inform public health policy and guidelines. However, the emerging picture of nutritional epidemiology is difficult to reconcile with good scientific principles. The field needs radical reform and he goes on to point out that med analyses of observational studies have found that almost all foods are associated with a higher risk of death if you crunch the data in certain ways. So, uh, it's not enough to say that, you know, governments are recommending this or that we have to look at the science and what the science is saying. And as I said, you two recent med analysis covering over a million people are not showing a relationship between saturated fat and heart disease and they're not showing any benefit from replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fats.

Speaker 2:          00:49:44       So these organizations, joel, you were describing, why do you think that they recommend, based on what chris has just said, why do you think that they recommend reducing your saturated fat? Reducing your cholesterol? Okay. Um, and thank you and you know, the important here, which we are technical in the weeds, but I want to bring it back. This discussion is, do you have a stroke, heart attack, erectile dysfunction, lose a leg, or do you not? Because at least one factor in development of these horrible medical problems that are 80 percent preventable, at least one of it is nutrition and the continuity. Nutrition. I mean, there's no doubt it's the single most important factor. It's never been the only fact that organizations are saying this. He's saying social studies don't support that. Well, uh, I disagree. The science and

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       I want to be very specific. Let's talk about cholesterol. Let's talk about saturated fat. So stay with saturated fat because there is differences there. They're both, uh, you know, contents of food, fatty contents of food, but they're chemically different in the volume. Weight is very, very different. Cholesterol only comes from animal saturated fat as animals and plants depending on the food source. So when this rise in heart attacks developed, research began 19, 48 and 1950, 1958. There were observations made that carefully done dietary logs, suggested these were hypotheses. There might be a connection between what you eat and heart attacks. And then it's centered on, um, you know, is it foods high in protein, foods, high sugar, foods, high in fatty sources. Ultimately they get sophisticated foods high in plant fat sources, foods high in animal fat sources, so by the late 19 fifties there was a very strong consensus already that foods high in animal products with saturated fat.

Speaker 4:          00:51:24       They go together. We're talking to meat, egg and cheese may be a role. Why? Let me give you a great example. in 1959, you grew up in Japan. You have a cholesterol of 120. You almost never see a heart attack. You moved to Hawaii because there's migration. Your cholesterol rises to a hundred 80. Welcome to America. Your heart attack, risk triples. You move to this great city, los angeles, this was published in 1959. Your cholesterol is now 2:10. You have 10 times the heart attack risk that you had when you lived in Japan. Genetics don't change that quick. This was within one generation. They're called nisei. People that leave Japan to move to California, the nisei, and there's the knee say, hon, study that. Track these people. now, is that the air? Is it that they adopted other bad habits? Shirt could be, but within a very short time that 10 times the risk of heart attack, so public research and dollars, this stuff is correlated with animal fats and proteins.

Speaker 4:          00:52:16       Why isn't correlated with sugar and refined carbohydrates so carefully done studies say, and I think we all agree more so now because we're overweight and now we're more insulin resistant and added sugars in the diet are more important in 2018 than they were when in the country was thin in 1960. They weren't good then. They aren't good now, but when you parse it out, multivariate analysis, there's a stronger relationship between the number one. food in studies like this is usually butter more than red meat. It's actually butter. That's just at our value. It's called statistic. I don't want to go so deep into statistics. It is somewhere there is sugar. I'll give you a classic study. If you could hold sugar the same and increased dietary saturated fat, heart disease, rockets. If you could hold saturated fat, the same. Increased sugar in these manipulations. Coronary heart disease doesn't increase. Let's point something out. I've been inside of hearts 15,000 times. I've never scooped sugar out of a blocked artery as scooped cholesterol out of blocked arteries. Twenty percent of every blockage in a heart is cholesterol. So fact that was discovered in 1910. It's never varied. Then we fed animal. Let's pause for a second, chris, you have something to say about that? Yeah, so that doesn't mean that the cholesterol is there because people were eating it. Joel, you know That could be though

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       that let. Let's say, let's look at what the research says again here. So they've done controlled feeding studies where they fed people two to four eggs a day and those show that in 75 percent of cases that has zero impact on blood cholesterol levels for the other 25 percent of people, they're termed hyper responders and in that group dietary cholesterol or does modestly increase ldl cholesterol, but it also increases hdl cholesterol and it does not increase the risk of heart disease. This is why the guidelines were changed on dietary cholesterol is there is no evidence that they're consuming dietary cholesterol increases the risk of blood cholesterol and most people, and even when it does, there's no evidence that it increases the risk of a heart attack, which is again why the dietary guidelines change for saturated fat. Again, it most of the studies that showed harm work, short term studies, these longer term studies have shown that on average eating saturated fat does not increase saturated fat levels in the blood and have all of the long term studies that looked at this.

Speaker 5:          00:54:31       Only one showed any association between saturated fat intake and cholesterol levels in the blood. Then we have a med analysis, lots of meta analyses actually, but one of the best known met analysis was of 17 randomized controlled trials of low carb diets that were high in saturated fats in published in the journal of obesity reviews, and they found that low carb diets neither increase nor decrease ldl cholesterol, but what they did find was that low carb diets are associated with decrease in body weight improvements in several cardiovascular risks. Risk factors including triglycerides, fasting glucose, blood pressure, body mass index, abdominal circumference, plasma, insulin, c reactive protein, as well as an increase in hdl cholesterol. Now, there hAve now been 10 meta analysis of randomized controlled trials looking at low carb diets for weight loss. all 10 showed that the low carb diet either outperformed in most cases or was was on this at the same level as low fat diets.

Speaker 5:          00:55:37       There have been several metta analyses now you can see them all at [inaudible] dot com slash rogan that have looked at a low carb diets for diabetes and cardiovascular risk markers and all of these meta analyses have found that low carb diets are superior for glycaemic control, for reducing insulin, for reducing triglycerides, and have beneficial effects across the board without increasing cardiovascular risk markers. So we're now we're talking about randomized control trials, which is the best form of evidence that we have and we're not seeing any harm from ink, you know, increased consumption of saturated fat. So it was the problem that you're citing epidemiology studies from the 19 forties in the 19 fifties was that definitely. I think we need to to to prefer

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       randomized controlled trials over that kind of evidence for sure. Why do you continue to go back to these studies from the 1940 and 19 fifties was beginning though the beginning, but chris just took 14 topics and put them into one for meta analysis during them as controls. The low carb, low fat. I mean they're all different topics and I don't know how you put that all together. You need clarity and laser focused. So we were talking saturated fat. I mean, so hypothesis has generated saturated fat in the diet. Butter, eggs and cheese may be bad for heart disease, something killing americans left to right in 1949 slash 50. Let's go into countries with widely different diets. Let's see what they're eating. Let's actually take their frigging diet back to minneapolis. Let's analyze it so it's not guessing. Not food frequency questionnaires were taking their meals back.

Speaker 4:          00:57:08       The United States analyze them, but boom, there's a relationship between dietary saturated fat and your risk. Fifty year followup, there's no short term followup. The study I'm referring to as 50 year 1958 to now and um, that strongly suggested that dietary saturated fat and heart disease that doesn't, that's not what's called the ultimate randomized clinical study, but it's one of high quality second study done in China at the same time with years of followup. So these are right up to date. There's publications right now from studies starting at then, but the publications are now, but then you get the best kind of study. Okay, I'm still unsaturated saturated fat. I'm not talking any other topic. You put people in a metabolic ward at the national institute of health, 395 of these studies published in 1979. You change their diet. This is the ultimate careful experiment. It might be for four weeks or six weeks, you up their saturated fat.

Speaker 4:          00:58:00       Their cholesterol rises assures can be, we're all different. The change in cholesterol is consistent. You're going to go up 20 percent, 20 percent, 20 percent. We start at different points. You have to track the change in clusteral. Chris referred tO. Can I go off on a tangent? It's really interesting, this will fascinate your listeners, but it's right on the topic. Two thousand and eight. This is published data. I don't bullshit on this. Two thousand eight Mexico city, the national, the international dairy council meet and they published their notes, which is why we know this and they said we are losing the battle. People are eating less dairy around the world and we are losing sales. Well, we can do is influence researchers influence expeditions, insistent speaker. Well, it's every. Every dairy council in the world just happens to meet in Mexico city that year. Then they go meet and Portugal.

Speaker 4:          00:58:47       Then they go meet in New York, whatever, 2008. We're going to put dollars into changing research and influencing people. doesn't mean it's all bad. They publish those notes that are global initiative for the next year. They looked for sympathetic researchers that would change public opinion and that was right before the milk mustache campaign. They find a gUy I actually reSpect now, but I'm going to beat them up a little. Dr. Ronald krauss, md in berkeley, California, right by him runs it a liquid center. He's had beef funding for 10 years. He said dairy funding. All of a sudden he's speaking to dairy industries all over in 2010, two years later, he publishes, we call it a meta analysis. That's not new research, that's statistical playing with previous studies that can be fair, can be unfair, whatever. Whatever it is, their conclusion is they could not find and verify that saturated fat in the diet.

Speaker 4:          00:59:37       Butter, eggs and cheese raises the risk of heart disease. they never said eat butter, eggs and cheese. They just couldn't verify what's amazing. It's an american journal of clinical nutrition. That same journal is a, is a editorial that destroys the study. This is 15 reasons. This is horrible. Epidemiology by guy named jeremiah stamler. I've never seen a medical journal destroy a piece that they accepted for publication. Okay, so everything's like stirred up and 2014, a guy named chowdry publishes a similar analysis. That is the reason that time magazine put on the cover butter is back because it was not new research. It's a meta analysis. It's all following this Mexico city, uh, effort to a fund dairy positive publications, a study so bad that both the journal required them to adjust and republish the data because of mistakes. The harvard school of public health said, take this thing away.

Speaker 4:          01:00:31       statistically. This is nonsense. Since those two times, and that's just the bottom line, we have had confusion in the public. We've got experts like chris experts like me, experts like dr mark hyman, experts like Dr. Walter willett audit on. There is a quote from the tobacco industry that our product is confusion. They didn't care about, you know, winning the battle when the is confused or just going to keep on doing habits they haVe. And that has got to stop because now we're in the weeds with conspiracy theories to saturate so that when the pendulum of 1950, 19, 69, 19, 97, 395 of the best done studies in the world, say you eat more saturated fat, your cholesterol goes up, more saturated fat, coronary heart disease goes up. It was clear, crystal clear in the guidelines, set the guidelines. Still say it. The guidelines still say limits what the same science from the 19 fifties in the 19 forties is applicable today. If it's in retrospect, valid there. Let's point out one, two. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think it is? Absolutely. Why? Because just bringing this up, we're

Speaker 5:          01:01:36       going back to observational studies done 50, 60 years ago that suffer from all of the problems that I mentioned to begin with and several more that we didn't have time to go into. Um, we have randomized controlled trialS now and you know, observational studies were never meant to prove a hypothesis. They're meant to generate a hypothesis and it's true that in some cases it's not possible to do a randomized controlled trial, like with cigarette smoking, you'd have to have the trial lasts for so long and you'd have to isolate people and award so they weren't exposed to air pollution and other factors that can affect the result. You can't do that. But in that case the risk was a thousand to 3000 percent higher. So there are criteria called the bradford hill criteria, which yOu can use and apply to observational studies to assess the chance that there's a causal relationship, and in the case of smoking, which actually was when the bradford bradford hill criteria were created, that really that meets many of those criteria in the case of nutrition research, very seldom did they meet more than a couple of the bradford hill criteria.

Speaker 5:          01:02:40       Now observational research in order to be valuable and needs to be confirmed, you know the results need to be replicated in a randomized controlled trial. That's how science is supposed to work. But there was one analysis that found that zero of 52 claims that were made in observational nutrition studies were replicated when they were tested later and in fact, five were replicated in the opposite direction. In other words, they did an experiment. They found the opposite results of what the observational studies suggested. So a good examples of this are obserVational studies originally suggested that beta carotene, an antioxidant that people with the highest intake of beta carotene, that's something like a 30 percent reduced risk of death, which is not really plausible anyways, but then when they started doing trials where they were giving people beta carotene, sUpplements, not only did it not improve their lifespan, they got more cancer, it increased the risK of cancer.

Speaker 5:          01:03:36       So this is why it's so important not to rely just on observational data and to do these experiments. Now going back to saturated fat, as I said, we've got a 2013 meta analysis of randomized controlled trials that found that low carb, high protein diets lead to greater improvements in glycaemic control compared to low fat american heart association, american diabetic association diets. We've got a 2014 meta analysis of randomized controlled trials that showed that low carb diets are more effective than high carb diets for patients with type two diabetes. And we've got another meta analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials just published in 2018 that found the same thing. So you know, science marches on, we, we, we learn more, we change and now we've got randomized controlled trials that are replacing some of the observational evidence from the fifties and sixties and seventies, which, which by the way in and dr hark homes paper, you see that that evidence was never strong to begin with and this is what we should be looking at.

Speaker 2:          01:04:37       So why are you consistently bringing up these studies for fifties? Because chris has mixing everything up. He's talking low carb data. Let's talk low carb diet. That's kito diet low carb you, you consistently bring up these studies from the 19 fifties. The 19 sixties diets are high in saturated fat. Okay? Nineteen 50, 96 was the initiation. Nineteen 97. Clark 395 randomized clinical trials. What chris looking for in metabolic ward? Say you jack up the saturated fat in your diet. You jack up your cholesterol. We can talk about cholesterol in a minute, but cholesterol matters. Ldl cholesterol matters in higher ed. Ask asking a question. You say 395 randomized controlled trials in 1997. Clark 1,907,

Speaker 4:          01:05:17       $395. Met him off. I'd love to see that different metabolic wards day. I can show you here. It's right here. I'll give you the rest of americans. Ninety five. He viewed 395, a randomized controlled trials in a meta analysis in metabolic ward. the tightest dietary exchange studies, the best sandwich would a metabolic where it is, but I don't understand the three 95. That's how many were there. Five people now. Three hundred 95 individual studies that played with fat content had died. It looked at markers of cardiovascular risks. 395 metabolic ward studies that were randomized, randomized controlled trials in metabolic wards. Yeah, they're going to be short term. That's true. You've got to read the literature. It's there. It's there. I've read the literature while you missed that one. That's a pretty important. Okay, but let's go back, but hold on a second. This is a dispute here, right? So what is your issue with. I'll just give you. It's no big deal. I'll give chris what is your issue? I'm not aware of 300. 90 five randomized controlled trials that have been done in a metabolic ward on this question, so I'd love to learn more about that if that's true. One second. It's clark, but so I mean I'm not stuck in the 19 fifties, but you know, if you don't agree,

Speaker 1:          01:06:26       right, that science has moved far past that and our understanding of nutrition and our understanding of the mechanisms of the effect of the food and the body. All that has changed radically

Speaker 4:          01:06:37       are we have not changed our flipcharts exchange, but that's not what I asked you as our understanding of the science change as well. Actually I would say that the observations made in the fifties and sixties if I held up, which is why 21 international societies, they'll say you will have held up that low saturated fat in the diet. Chicken, eggs, cheese, beef is related to raising your cholesterol is related to your increased risk of heart attacks, strokes,

Speaker 1:          01:07:06       19 fifties,

Speaker 4:          01:07:09       initial initial. Then we got randomized clinical trials. Those are called metabolic ward studies and such. The first, the first chink in the, in the armor was a 2010. I gave you the background to it, the siri torino study, the [inaudible] study, but they have been resolved. We've decided to throw out 50 years of science, just mentioned several other med analyses of I know, probably a 50 randomized controlled trials collectively here. and these are

Speaker 1:          01:07:37       modern studies. So joel, what is the difference? Like what, why, why do you think that these old studies are applicable and why you dismissing this new evidence?

Speaker 4:          01:07:47       okay, so I just, just so chris and I can resolve this issue. British medical journal in 1997, dietary lipids and blood cholesterol. Three hundred 95 individual dietary experience, uh, put together in a med analysis. It's a classic study that people know they actually estimated if we could lower the saturated fat content of the british population by 60 percent and we would save x number of heart attacks. What year? Nineteen 97. Nineteen 97. So to answer your question, why do I think old studies are relevant? You have to keep probing and questioning and probing and questioning. But until this date, every major medical society, not one. If there'S one you'd question at 21, international sizes say you will further the populace health. If you lower saturated fat in the diet and we can't pinpoint the amount of cholesterol you should lower, which is only from animal sources, but you should lower it to as low as possible.

Speaker 4:          01:08:40       According to the usda epidemiology studies, this was randomized data. It's random. It's based on. And the guidelines have changed, uh, as, as we said in 2010, the new evidence, there's new evidence is the new science, like whatever they've studied today, like what, what the better methods of detection, more, more understanding, more data to go from. Wouldn't you agree that we should look at new studies? We should, let me tell you say so wait, let me tell you, when I published a study in 2012, that's when quoted 100,000 times for a major medical journal. It uses something called men delian randomization. We don't need to do randomized clinical trials all the time. There are these gigantic databases now about genetic abnormalities and certain other parameters. So there is a database with 300,000 people. We know what's called their snips. You've probably heard of snips, you know chris is biology and jeans aren't the same as mine, and there's variability if you're born with one of nine snips that keeps your cholesterol low your entire life.

Speaker 4:          01:09:45       This is a genetic gift to you. The observation in this major study quarter all over the world, first author is brian ferentz, but I'm there. Number five, ldl randomization is new data that it is an advantage for your survival and advantage, your risk of heart attack, stroke to have a low ldl, your whole life. New data. Is it consistent with 60 years of science, but boom, it sure was. We actually have learned stuff that has changed our mind when you do that same cutting edge science on hdl, the happy one, the high one. You cannot show the same association anymore. We're totally confused by the hdl. Particle ldl is the focus of atherosclerosis low ldl, and I'll just finish dr loren cordain. I'd love to talk about the history of the paleo movement. Dr loren cordain, who at the first popular book, a phd in Colorado, has written an article in 2004.

Speaker 4:          01:10:34       It says the ideal ldl cholesterol is 50 to 70. Well man, he should be a cardiologist because I'm going to hug them for that because he thought that saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol, increases your risk of heart attack and stroke. This is the founding pillars. This 2004 and a big isn't a medical journal. I mean this is peer reviewed. It was an editorial, but it's peer review of 50 to 70 ldl. I'm really cool there with loren cordain and 50 to 78, but our understanding of nutrition is advanced pretty radically since I'm not. Yeah. And I'm not here to represent paleo. I mean, I never been, uh, uh, ideological about paleo. Even if you read my first book,

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       I'm recommending dairy products,

Speaker 1:          01:11:16       but I don't want to get lost in this because you pause for a second. So what is your response though to all these studies that he was citing? You're citing these old studies that seem to contradict what he saying, but these new studies that he showing and you could, we can go over them again, but you didn't address. You did

Speaker 5:          01:11:35       well, he didn't say saying them by name.

Speaker 1:          01:11:41       What? Why are the results so different than the new studies?

Speaker 5:          01:11:44       Oh, well people better at statistics than me with say manipulation of what's called meta analysis. These aren't new studies. I mean these are old studies lumped together with different analyses that led to a conclusion that was accurate. These are. These are randomized controlled trials that are long term. That's 20 years, 30 years, 40 years. There is no such show. Of course they're not doing 20 or 30 or 40 year randomized controlled trial. We have fish. We have 50 year data on seven I'll study of 50 years. Problem

Speaker 1:          01:12:18       difference, again we've already outlined is a big difference between epidemiology studies and randomized trial.

Speaker 5:          01:12:26       Randomized controlled trials are not short term. Many of them are go up to two years in length. If we're going to see changes in lipids, we're going to see them within a few weeks and certainly within a few months, so if we're not seeing them in a few months, we're not going to see them later. And you know the. If you look at dr. Hark homes paper, she reviews all of the the meta analyses and looking at saturated fat and the connection with heart disease. There are 39 med analyses of rcts or prospective cohort studies that looked at saturated fat and health outcomes. Thirty five of 39 did not show significant correlations between saturated fat and any outcome. Okay. Thirty five of 39 of the four that did one was more related to trans fats, not saturated fats. OnE showed a benefit of replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat, but it excluded twO studies that would have totally changed the result.

Speaker 5:          01:13:21       And as I mentioned, there's the med analysis of 25 rcts and 40 observational studies that showed no benefit of replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat. And then the last two were cochrane reviews. And in those two, saturated fat and cardiovascular disease were correlated, but saturated fat was not correlated with total mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, a fatal heart attack, nonfatal heart attack, stroke or a heart death from heart disease or death from any diagnoses of diabetes. So joel, I'm going to let you get you had out of those 39 trials, virtually none showed that eating saturated fat will increase your risk of heart disease and none showed that it will increase your risk of death from any cause. So that is pretty damning evidence.

Speaker 1:          01:14:08       Now, if I could summarize for you or get you to summarize your position, is that his reciting of these older studies that they are not relevant, that they are epidemiologists, study that they are, they are not as rigorous and that this new evidence is based on a new understanding and new science and that he's ignoring this.

Speaker 5:          01:14:29       Yeah, the early studies showed some relationship, but they were short, very short term between eating saturated fat and then and then cholesterol. The other problem is they were using cholesterol as a proxy marker. They weren't looking at did people eat saturated fat and die more? They'd looked at did saturated fat, inCreased cholesterol. Um, so when they, when they did longer term studies, there's no increase in cholesterol on average. That doeSn't mean no one will experience an increase. That's not true. Some people will, but on average there was no increase in. And then when they looked at they just took cholesterol out of the equation. Let's just look at is there an increase in heart attacks or death from eating saturated fat when they did that? There's no increase in [inaudible]. These are that, those are observational studies and we have all these randomized controlled trials that are showing no, no increase in cholesterol, no increase in insulin levels and actually a decrease in all of those markers. Joel,

Speaker 4:          01:15:27       um, important stuff. And a lot of stuff was said. And I doubt it, unless you're really high level, you understood. I just want to pick out one thing chris said, does anybody know what the cochrane database? So where'd the flow of his mouth? Cochran coc, h r n e is a group of scientists to try and be very objective, very independent, don't have any emotional, any books, any supplements, any food, and nothing, and we all love supplements around this table, but let's get out of that cochrane database. Every five years, comes out with a statement that saturated fat relate to the risk of heart disease. In 2015, the most recent hooper look up hooper lookup cochrane database. YeS it does. Chris said it, but he flew by it. No, it wasn't powerful enough that your choice of butter, eggs, meat, and cheese necessarily predicted your total lifespan, but it absolutely predicted your risk of developing a heart attack and stroke according to this independent david.

Speaker 4:          01:16:18       How 2015. Well, how does it do it? Saturated fat in the diet lowers the ldl receptor. Gene liver. Let's talk some real science. Your liver, my liver. Chris's liver. When you don't have ldl receptors or less than you should on the surface of your liver cells, you ldl stays in your blood. it gets into your arterial wall. That's my field. Don't jack with manner, tara walls. It gets picked up by monocytes and macrophages become foamy cells and you fucking dead, and that's how it starts. When you eat saturated fat, there's a chain of events that biologists and chemists and scientists know. There's no question. Nineteen 85 nobel prize in medicine. Nobody would not go to the eighties. Again. When you go to these studies, just want you to refute, okay, 2012, I published a study which one of us is as scientists around the table.

Speaker 4:          01:17:07       I've got it open. It's a journal, american kind of high energy may please read the conclusion, the lower your ldl level beginning in life, the greater issue. Reduction in your risk of developing a heart attack and stroke, and I'll give you an interesting statistic. If you take lipitor and you drop your ldl cholesterol 30 percent, you will typically drop your risk of a heart attack. If you're in the coronary range by 30 percent. If you drop your ldl by 30 percent because you're born with a genetic gift, that it's just a lower than the average american, you drop your risk of heart attack by 90 percent. When you keep your cholesterol down your whole life. I'm telling you, your blood cholesterol level, your whole life, you are golden and the heart attack and stroke risk. The problem was they do. We pick up people at age 50, 60 and we start jaclyn with her diet and jacket with their drugs and that's wonderful.

Speaker 4:          01:17:51       They've had 50, 60 years of deteriorating their arteries and we help them. We can't help them like teaching children eat fruits and vegetables and stay away from hot dogs. That's where we got to go. That's the second gong to get kids healthy because they got their whole life. Please, what is wrong with what he said? Well, there's. There's illusions to what's the number one, two things wrong and I, you know, I'm really not trying to nitpick. He doesn't like epidemiology, but he totally uses epidemiology to support his case. You can't have it both ways. I love basic biochemistry. I love epidemiologists. I love randomized studies, I love sitting there and in studies, my foundation is broad and it's what's called the scientific method that's used by scientists and los angeles, and that's taught me a number two. Uh, besides that, there's, there's illusions to significant randomized clinical trials in meta analysis. We got to keep the science clean as can be. A breakthrough has been the meta analysis. Siri torino chowdry 2010, 2014 d'souza, thousand 15. They haVe severe flaws. They're not new research. They're rehashing old data. There has not been a randomized clinical trial that really challenges the coronary heart disease risk or meaning and increased saturated fat that you three right now. So long are they? Hold on.

Speaker 5:          01:19:04       There is american journal of clinical nutrition, 2013. I'm a judge or holla. I'm not sure how to pronounce the name. These are all on my website. If you go to [inaudible] dot com slash research, you can see them or crestor.com/rogan, and you scroll down to the saturated fat section. You can see them. This is a total of 20 randomized controlled trials and the results low carb load, gi, mediterranean, and high protein diets are effective in improving various markers of cardiovascular risk and people with diabetes should be considered the overall strategy of diabetes management. And then we've got a one from a snore guard, systematic review and meta analysis of dietary carbohydrate restriction in patients witH type two diabetes. And this was a review of 10 rcts and they found not only was the low carb diet more effective for diabetes than the low fat diet, the greater the carbohydrate restriction, the greater the effect.

Speaker 5:          01:20:03       And then we have one from 2018. This is sainsbury at all and this is effective dietary carbohydrate restriction on glycemic control in adults with diabetes. And they found that the low carb, uh, the conclusion, this review suggests that low carb restricted or carbohydrate restricted diets could be offered to people livinG with diabetes as part of an individualized management plan. So these are finding that these, these are, you know, reviews of several randomized controlled trials that are finding that there's no increase in cardiovascular risk markers. There's actually an improvement in cardio vascular risk markers and there's an improvement in diabetes markers like blood sugar, insulin weight, visceral fat, et cetera. So I mean this is the, the, the, the gold standard of evidence that we have is randomized controlled trials and meta analyses. Of course they do. They're, there are problems. They can be done poorly.

Speaker 5:          01:21:01       They can be done well. That's true of any kInd of scientific research, but we can't throw out really the highest standard of evidence is a meta analysis of randomized controlled trials because you can just. Anyone can pick one randomized controlled trial to support their view. The met analysis does is it looks at all of the evidence and it looks at the quality of evidence and then it comes up with a result from looking at all of these trials and that's, that's where science is today and these low carb diets are high in saturated fat. They are high in saturated fat. Yeah. Unless they're explicitly doing a trial where they're doing a low carb diet that's the tire and mono unsaturated fat, but those are rare. Generally, people who are reading low carb diets or eating a lot more saturated fat. Joel,

Speaker 4:          01:21:44       just three quick bullet points. Number one, it is low carb literature. We're talking saturated fat and coronary disease. That's a mixture. It's not the topic we're talking about. Number two, these are buying at the top of that. We're talking about low carbs, a whole different nutritional. That's that. We haven't seen it. That's what he said. Yeah, no, you can do low carbon jack up protein, but most of the experts say, don't do that. That's called meat. You can do low carbon jack up fat. That doesn't necessarily mean you're jacking up your saturated fat. I do low carb plant based. That's a whole different topic, but it is not the number one. These are one. It's low carb. It's not the main topic that's dominated cardiovascular research for 60 years, which is consistent to this day in every guideline. Limit saturated fat. She don't die of a heart attack.

Speaker 4:          01:22:27       Stroke number two, I just. These are words your listeners may not know. These seats that our biomarker studies, I'm talking about dying of heart attacks, having heart attacks, having stroke. I care if your blood sugar marker called hemoglobin a, one c goes down. I care if your ldl and your high sensitivity c reactive protein goes down, but that's not life and death. Those are biomarkers, so usually correlated with better health. If you're not tracking in artery, you're not in my scientific field because I track arteries in clinic, we track arteries in our research studies. Um, I think that's the second thing I wanted to say, but you know, I'm not here to actually negate the data that compared the crappy calorie rich and process died. The most americans are eating what chris is presenting as alternative diet won't improve numbers in the lab. Absolutely. It's a better choice. I like your diet. I do. Joe. I like your diet, chris, because I'm looking at people walking in wendy's and hardee's and mcdonald's and hospital cafeterias and gas stations. That's what we need to shut down and we'll make a main difference at all we're left with is chris's diet, joe's diet and joel's diet. We're going to have an amazing country. Then you can decide what you want.

Speaker 1:          01:23:36       I think we all agree with that, but I still need to bring you back to this, what he's talking about in terms of saturated fat and not being a risk and not increasing your cholesterol. You seem to disagree with that.

Speaker 4:          01:23:50       Sure. Because the science says it does. I mean, he just said,

Speaker 5:          01:23:53       I would say that it doesn't show me. Let me clarify something too. I wasn't. I'm not just talking about biomarkers. Biomarkers are important, but I was the one who argued for looking at total mortality is the most important endpoint and mortality for many of these other diseases and for the conclusion from Dr. Hart comes paper where she reviewed all of the evidence on saturated fat that I talked about before and I just mentioned 35 of 39 studies didn't show any relationship. Here's the conclusion. No meta analysis of randomized controlled trials and slash or prospective cohort studies. Those are observational studies, has found any significant difference for dietary fat interventions and all cause mortality. That's deaths from any cause or death from heart disease or associated with dietary fat and heart disease mortality. In other words, there's no med analysis of randomized controlled trials that shows that eating more saturated fat will will increase your risk of death

Speaker 1:          01:24:50       and your take on this is that this is the latest science and that would he siting in terms of these studies from the 19 fifties, the 19 sixties aren't really relevant?

Speaker 5:          01:24:58       Yes, and it that that, but even even if we look at epidemiology, like I said earlier, that there are. There's a meta analysis of studies including 350,000 participants that found no relationship between saturated fat intake and cardiovascular disease and then a more recent review that included both randomized controlled trials, 25 of them and 40 observational studies with 650,000 participants that that concluded. Current evidence doesn't clearly support cardiovascular guidelines that encourage high consumption of polyunsaturated fat and low consumption of pto of saturated fat. So whether you look at the epidemiology or whether you look at the randomized controlled trials are the meta analysis of randomized controlled trials. You ended up in the same place,

Speaker 1:          01:25:44       joel,

Speaker 4:          01:25:46       most modern data, we already talked this, everyBody please google cochrane database saturated fat. Two thousand 15 hooper is the author. He the introduction is reducing saturateD fat, reduces serum cholesterol, but we're not sure of the importance. So we took 15 randomized studies with 59,000 participants. The conclusion there is a potentially important reduction in heart disease risk by reducing saturated fat in your diet. Two thousand 15, which is why 21 international societies are solid that we will help the public. We will help the listeners have your piece of meat, make it four ounces, not 14 ounces, have your bake and make a one strip, not for strips. Have your cheese, just don't eat it every day and don't eat large amounts. The amount of cheesy United States has gone insane because the usta funds cheese manufacturers. Okay, so 2015. I can't get you a better one though. They'll update cochrane database in 20 slash 20.

Speaker 4:          01:26:40       It'll be the same. What's your take on when you said so? Here's johnny. I don't care. Honestly what he said, I've got to go with the best science in the world because I deal with patients who have serious disease. I can tell my patients the most updated data analysis of randomized clinical studies say saturated fat in your diet raises your cholesterol, lowering saturated fat, like eating less animal products, not the most. Up to date. Two thousand 15 database mentioned to several med analyses from 2008. This is not been announced. This is random as clinical studies. Fifty 9,000 participants out there reviewing studies. That's not a that's and that's w. We have to look at the weight of evidence. There are lots of studies published all the time and that's again why looking at med analyses of randomized controlled trials, looking at very large reviews of observational studies with over a million participants and you end up in the same place.

Speaker 4:          01:27:31       Of course we can go and find one study here, one study there that that is different has a different result, but that's not the scientific method. The scientific method is to look at the weight of the evidence and to continue to evaluate that over time as the evidence changes. And you know, this is a great quote from johnny and dennis, the stanford epidemiologists that I mentioned, um, that, that, that reminds us that we can't just rely on the past to inform the present. He said claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. And that what that means is that let's say, you know, you haVe a paper that, uh, you know, 30, 40, 50 years ago that says saturated fat increases the risk of cholesterol. Then later somebody makes that claim and a paper just like that initial sentence, saturated fat raises cholesterol.

Speaker 4:          01:28:25       You see a little number, they're referencing that one paper. Then a couple of years later, somebody else makes that same claim. They referenced the second paper which was referencing the first paper and on and on it goes. And the whole thing is a house of cards. That's what most people don't realize that that is bad science. This was good side. The bad side is what you're saying. You're saying you see what he's saying is because we know not. Again, he's making comments that have no reference shortly. If there's misquoted the references. CAn I give an example? How does he have no references? A scientific peer reviewed paper that quoted or referenced in everybody's simply passively keeps requesting their reference. It was wrong in the beginning. I can give you a real life internet example wigs because gary dobbs, my new friend, but sometimes my adverse adversary, but I can't give you a literature reference. It might be one, but these are very general statements. I just want to. I think we should

Speaker 3:          01:29:22       move on, but no, I definitely shouldn't because we're not really clearing this up. What is he saying that's wrong? Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:29:30       The best scientific analysis of the global topic to saturated fat. Rich containing foods which are animal sourced foods at high amount in your diet, increase your risk of dying of a heart attack or stroke or have a heritage. Stroke goes to the biochemistry, etc. Offend your diet, will lower the number of ldl receptors on your liver and your blood close to it goes up. That's backed by 395 metabolic ward studies, but that is biochemistry. Then you get to epidemiology countries that eat more saturated fat. Finland. Great story, and I got to tell it, 1970. The highest heart attack rate in the world was Finland. Guys were dying your age and my age at the highest rate, the lowest heart attack rate in the mediterrAnean was crete. Forty percent of calories from fat and Finland. Forty percent of calories from fat and crete. Is that. How can that happen? Because I'm not an advocate for low fat diet except for very selected clinical cases. IT was olive oil and crete. That's very low, not zero low in saturated fat. It was cheese, it was meat, it was beef, it was butter in Finland. They instituted a national program to lower the content, has saturated fat in the diet and Finland. five years later, hard tech dropped 80 percent.

Speaker 3:          01:30:34       Kevin, do you understand that? He's. He's saying something totally different. You're citing epidemiologist chemistry. Then I went to epic. What's wrong with what he said, because he's not being broad with the scientist

Speaker 4:          01:30:47       getting. He's getting mired in the woods. I'm telling you, the broadest view from 50,000 feet up, biochemistry supports it. Epidemiology supports at 395 metabolic ward studies, my randomized mendelian randomization so said though, because he's not looking at the entirety of the data and I'm telling you the entire data. Then you'd go to loma linda, okinawa, you go to [inaudible], you'd go to Costa Rica and you go to sardinia. If you are live to 100 and you're still operating on somebody's heart is you're likely high in animal saturated fat or not. The answer is it isn't. It's as low as three percent of the diet and okay,

Speaker 3:          01:31:21       what could it possibly be? other faculty user bias that. There's a great stat recently that came out that showed that just following the top five health behaviors which are basic, so we're talking about not smoking, not drinking, maintaining a healthy body weight, getting some physical activity and eating healthy. You know, relatively healthy diet, like not junk all the time. Increases your lifespan by 13 years and that's where you cannot. You can't look at these at these populations and make inferences about animal products being the driving factor one way or the other because there's just too many other factors. There's no way to control for all of

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       those factors in a study and that's why we have to come back to the scientific method. We use observational studies to come up with hypotheses. Then we do randomized controlled trials to either confirm or refute those hypotheses. As I said before, in many cases, what is apparent and observational studies or what seems apparent to is not later confirmed in randomized controlled trials. And that's where we're at now wIth saturated fat and dietary cholesterol. I just mentioned three very large meta analysis of randomized controlled trials that failed to confirm any association of saturated fat and heart disease and, or saturated fat and increase in these risk markers. And I mentioned to reviews of very large observational study data including 350,000 in one study in 650 in another showing no relationship. So the mechanistic arguments about liver, you know, the saturated fat does this or that, uh, that's not convincing. If it's not showing up in the data, if it did that, then we would see it in the observational studies in the randomized studies.

Speaker 4:          01:33:08       Now, specifically joel, what is your take on what he just said? Well, we just had another gang moment, so chris just quoted and it's actually a little bit comical, a harvard school of public health study on how do you live 14 years longer. It's epidemiology, but he's using it until the senior author is Dr. Walter willett. A guy he calls a vegan pro, uh, advocate who's not at all vegan. He's written a book about the mediterranean diet with all kinds of animal recipes in it, which is fine with me. He's a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant senior harvard researcher, but she's using data that he says is weakened such, yet the teaching point is there. How do you live 14 years longer? You don't smoke exercise 30 minutes a day. He eat better than average. That's very broad, but you'd better than average. You, um, keep your waist under 25, a bmi under 25 and you have a few alcoholic beverages a week. I want your listeners to write that down because that is solid epidemiologic data that's fairly consistent across across the spectrum. So let's all use something to teach your listeners, but that's my point. So you can't look at cultures that have a completely different lifestyle than

Speaker 5:          01:34:13       standard american lifestyle and draw any inferences about animal products. So a really good example of this is, you know, the seventh day adventists, uh, the, the, the claim is that it's the vegetarian diet that makes them live longer than the general population, but they, as I mentioned before, as part of their belief system, they don't smoke, they don't drink, they have a healthy lifestyle in general. What if there was another population that also had those kinds of belief systems about not smoking, not drinking and healthy lifestyle, but they also ate meat. Well, turns out there is the mormons and there've been three studies on mormons and each of the mormon, the studies had been done on mormons, found that they're mortality. I'll give you the exact numbers here in just a second. Um, for whatever reason that's not coming up here. But um, their risk of death compared to the general population was something like 50 percent lower than the general population on average and yet they're eating animal foods. They're not vegetarian like the seventh day adventist. So

Speaker 1:          01:35:22       point and bringing that epidemiologists study in the first place, bringing up healthy lifestyle, increasing your lifespan by 14 years is to show that any positive move is going to show whether it's just exercise and not eating sugar or whatever is going to show an increase in, in your lifespan.

Speaker 5:          01:35:39       Yeah, and just to show how hard it is to isolate single variables and the influence of those single variables in an observational study on, on those effects, and this is something that you noticed johnny geneticists said over and over again, is that it's almost impossible if not impossible to disentangle the influences of all of these single variables in observational research. And again, I'm not saying we shouldn't use observational research. I'm saying we should be circumspect about how you use it and we should be aware of the limitations and the flaws and keep those in mind when we're designing observational studies and when we're interpreting their results.

Speaker 1:          01:36:20       So joe, what is your opinion on what he's saying about saturated fat and cholesterol and mortality risk?

Speaker 4:          01:36:27       Okay. Well, I think I've said it, but I'll repeat it. I just want to point out we just shared another common moment. We're both lifestyle medicine doctors of which nutrition is just one part. We just went through a list of lifestyle factors. We now add sleep, we had social support, we had stress management skills. It's not all smoking diet, exercise and and the size of your body, but we are aligned and in know and we will go at patient's side by side and do a lot of the exactly the same thing. In fact, I think the only thing they're squabble about and lifestyle medicine is optimal nutrition to prevent chronic disease and there's probably more than one path, but god knows the plant based medicine group has a tremendous body of science. I'll conclude one more time and I don't know how many times I can say at the highest level of science to integrate all that's available biochemistry's on the side.

Speaker 4:          01:37:15       Saturated fat raises your risk of coronary heart disease. It doesn't mean nobody eats a no saturated fat diet, but you can lower it. A observational studies where their epidemiology studies were to test that hypothesis. They confirm Finland and crete I've talked about. I won't go there. Again. Randomized clinical trials have confirmed it. Hooper cochrane database 2015. My study 2012, widely cited worldwide has confirmed it. Get your ldl cholesterol down genetically or by diet as long as you can, as early as you can, and finally in the last is what a old healthy people do. Actually, chris, I just think there's a good concept to let your listeners know. It isn't all about lifespan. In fact, lifespan, the united is dropping, which is very scary for all the frigging money we spend on health. There's something called health span, which is to avoid chronic disease and die dancing or die, swimming or die sky diving, but don't die in a frigging hospital with a peg tube and a trake and a and a foley up your, uh, who, who, and um, many of these studies that show you can reduce your risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes are talking about better quality of life.

Speaker 4:          01:38:17       So when you put all that together, these centenarian studies that have low saturated fat diets are just one more piece I just mentioned for incredibly solid piece of evidence. Not one, it's for, it's all that's out there. It's what nobel prize winners use when they describe the cholesterol hypothesis is what is this correct? He may not know it. In this city of los angeles, our shared friend, dr valter longo often considered, and you should have on the show perhaps the world's leading expert in nutrition, longevity and such. We'll say you incorporate all the bases for nutritional evaluation. You keep it big picture. You don't that he calls it pixel mentality. You don't get hung up on one study. You get the whole picture biochemistry, epidemiology, randomized clinical trials. finally centenarian studies. I think it's very consistent. You will enhance your health by lowering animal based products.

Speaker 4:          01:39:06       Now we can argue is that 70 percent, 80 percent, 90 percent plant based loren cordain and uh, the founder of the paleo movement, um, boyd eaton, we were talking about 70 percent plants on your plate. I love that. You know, I'm not telling people quit eating meat today or thy, I'm not a reactionary, but to say that plant based medicine doesn't have a strong basis that I can't reverse plaque which just plant based medicine. We haven't even talked about the ability to do that, but iS his absolute heresy because it in fact is one of the most powerful piece

Speaker 3:          01:39:37       attrition we have. Okay, but what's wrong with these studies that he's talking about their pixel mentalities, picking one, know how observational data of over a million people and three different meta analyses of 20 to 25 randomized controlled trials each pixel mentality. This is the gold standard for assessing a question like this in medicine. It's not mechanistic data or mechanistic arguments don't make, are not persuasive if they don't translate into real outcomes that you can measure in randomized controlled trials or observational studies like trying to boil this down. So what is your take on that without any references to the past and people that lived in Angola that live longer.

Speaker 4:          01:40:21       These are the three disruptive randomized trials from 2010 on that question. The relationship.

Speaker 3:          01:40:26       Those are different trials, joel. Well then these are three different trials. I'm not the crosses researcher or chowder worries you. You need to. You need to throw them out there and let us know the reference I did before. You want me to do it again? No, but we will get my yard. I mean, what is wrong with what he's saying? I'm just look at them. Obviously the non expert here and I'm baffled. So I'm trying to boil this down with his little rhetoric as possible. Okay. It

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       a heretical conspiracy attitude to say everybody's got it wrong for 60 years. Twenty one international societies have rung. They could, but it's a controversy theory to say that, that, um, hooper cochrane database, 2015, they've got it wrong, that metabolic ward studies got it wrong. This is one or two or three pieces of data and their observational, you don't throw out the babies with the benefit randomized controlled trials saying they're observational if they're not. What men analysis by nature is implying. It's not a new study. it's taking previous studies in doing so. Let me give you one quick example. In the chowdry meta analysis created butter is back on the cover of time magazine created a whole fervor out there that we can go back to and all these great foods that atkins wants us to eat. They correlated your blood cholesterol with your risk of having heart disease.

Speaker 4:          01:41:48       They couldn't confirm it. Well, they allowed people in that men analysis who are on lipitor, well, of course you're on a medicine, lowers your cholesterol. They didn't exclude those people. That has been resoundingly criticized as, yes, it looks good. It's in a journal. It's a meta analysis that is fraudulent or at least relatively inappropriate statistics. It's, you know, it's, it's so technical, it's beyond, I think, the importance of this discussion, but I just say 50,000 feet elevation view of the best nutrition is again, four pillars that I keep talking about indicates you'd be very wise to limit the amount of saturated fat and that's endorsed by every major medical society in the world. It's not controversial. It's not controversial. I don't. I don't think it's conspiracy. I think it's just the natural progression of science. When we used to think the world was flat, but that's theirs were caused by stress, but that's down there.

Speaker 4:          01:42:40       There are a lot of things that have changed over time as the evidence evolves and is we'd be. We become more educated and aware of some sort of a belief in a conspiracy. Well, chris is suggesting we got it wrong, which means the american heart, american college, the world health institute of medicine, the european society of atherosclerosis, the australian society of health, all of these bleep, bolded, tell you 10 percent or less saturated fat. Some say as little as you could possibly get in your diet have got it wrong and that suggests there's been a total misrepresentation of all the sciences. I paused for a second there. What are their recommendations based on? Is it based on old science? No, I mean these are long. Have they been saying this and what is it based on? And have they adjusted to this new science? He's discussing [inaudible], republican, republican, republican for the usta republishes every five years. Two thousand and 16. Not long ago. Five years. Two thousand 16 was the last usd a publication there. We'll do it again in 20 slash 20. But doesn't this science change? Not that fast. Not that fast. There's nothing new since 2000 took theme that rocks the idea that 21 international got

Speaker 5:          01:43:51       it wrong there. Nothing. There isn't. The 2015 report did not use. Um, there was a, the usta setup, the nutrition evidence library to help conduct systemic reviews to answer some of these questions. And in the 2015 report, the committee stated that it didn't use that database for 70 percent of the topics. And um, the, the, a lot of the guidelines hadn't used any newer science from since 2010 and there had been large reviews as I just mentioned, these, these three reviews that I mentioned, one was in 2000, 13, one was in 2017 and one was in 2018. These are the reviews of the randomized controlled trials that didn't show increase in cardiovascular risk markers from saturated fat consumption. and then we had those observation reviews of observational studies of 300,000, 650,000 people. I think the same thing will happen with saturated fat, as I said in 2010, they changed their recommendations on total fat.

Speaker 5:          01:44:58       They used to limit total fat and then they changed those in 2010, 2015, they changed their recommendation on dietary cholesterol. And I think probably the next time, you know, maybe it's the next time or maybe it's the time after that you'll see a change in the saturated fat guidelines. And it's not a big conspiracy. I'm not saying, you know, it's not a conspiracy, it's the advancement of science. So your take is that these organizations are behind the curve. Yes. And if we want to talk about conflicts of interest, there are huge conflicts of interest in these organizations. Something like 40 percent of the funding of the uh, uh, well, I don't want to get this number wrong, but a lot. The american heart association, american diabetic association, a lot of these organizations have funding from big food. Um, you know, coca cola, you talked to a nutritionist who goes to these conferences and they, you know, there's like nestle bars and coca cola at the nutrition conferences.

Speaker 5:          01:45:52       That's hilarious. Yeah, it's hilarious. This terrible, wasn't it? Yeah. I mean it's, it's actually funny and sad at the same time. And so I'm not saying there's a big conspiracy, but I am saying there's a problem in terms of scientific integrity when you have these organizations, they're tasked with creating the guidelines that have these financial conflicts of interest. That's not really how it should be, but I don't, I don't even want to go too far down that road because we don't need to go there in order to show that the sciences, what the, what the science is showing and peer review journals. So joel, what is wrong with what he just said? Well, I'll say this until 2020 usda guidelines come in. Actually think he's factually wrong because he goes to a guideline, say keep the percentage of calories from saturated fat to 35 percent or less. I could be wrong on that. I'm not an encyclopedia. I know they say, oh, I agree with that. Well, why? I said they changed their total, their

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       limitation on total fat in 2010. And I, I'm speculating that eventually changed their guidelines on saturated fat because the science has evolved and I will buy you guys are all paid trip to bali. If you see in the 2020 guidelines that saturated fat is still not to be limited to that. Right? So what's wrong with what he said? Uh, I, I don't know it just. Well it's about. I agree there are conflicts of funding, but they're not unique to any particular sector. Um, we just had one of the most famous food psychologist in Connecticut. Brian wants it goes. A hero of mine, said eden small plates because we didn't. SmAll plates. You're mindful and you don't get obese. had to have six papers rejected and had to resign. It's pervasive. It's a problem. Doesn't mean there's not been any good scientists and I think most of the people we've been talking about are largely good scientists that their reputation hasn't been tainted.

Speaker 2:          01:47:41       I don't want to get, get too Mired in this, but if you look at the egg industry prior to 1990, about 30 percent of egg studies on nutrition, we're funded by the egg board since 1990. It's 92 percent. It's a conflict. Who's got the money to study nutrition? It's not the broccoli grower stop you because we're getting in the weeds again. What is wrong with what he said? Well, he's predicting that there'll be a change in the record. I think there's no, there's no substantial new data on saturated fat since 2015 hooper in 2016 usta. That changes anybody to question that they should not recognize and follow the leadership of 21 international societies that are out there to try and improve the copy there because those 21 international societies and all these different organizations, they rely on current science to make the recommendations correct? sure, sure.

Speaker 2:          01:48:32       Okay. And are they often behind the curve? I don't believe so. The usda, it goes through this whole presence now. They haven't published anything new since 2016. It's an expensive process, but they did change. Like he said, they're total fat requirements. They did change what they believe to be healthy and not healthy. Um, well said. They changed it in 2010. Correct. It changed the limitation on total fat in 2010 and then they changed the limitation on dietary cholesterol in 2015. So they admit that the sciences advanced and changed their perceptions of what is in and is not healthy. So what's wrong with what he's saying aBout saturated fat?

Speaker 6:          01:49:09       Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:49:10       they didn't chain saturated fat, so if we stick just, they're, they, they rely on the current science. Right? So he's saying that the current science is showing that there is no negative consequences of saturated fat. That's bs, that's bs. So what is wrong with these studies that he's citing?

Speaker 6:          01:49:27       Well,

Speaker 2:          01:49:29       I don't know. I have not read every article in the world, nor has chris. I don't know specifically. There are three faMous studies that I've read. Siri, torino, chowdry and d'souza. Those have been dissected. Those are event generally, but you don't believe the ones that he cited? Well, I don't, I don't know actually he would probably those to support

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       his case, but they've been so resoundingly criticized that and they created fervor and I'll, I don't know this sounding, said it criticized.

Speaker 5:          01:49:57       I'm aware that there has been criticism, but you could say the same thing about the vegetarian lifespan studies to the I, a arc report on processing scientifically been debunked by any stretch of the imagination. They are the papers stand. The authors have defended against those criticisms. And uh, it's nothing like what joel was talking about with brian wansink who had to re, you know, all the papers were proven to be fraudulent and he had to retract them. It's nothing like that that has happened with those papers and those were not the ones that I cited anyway. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:50:31       I just want to say the usd in 2015 said total fat intake should be 20 to 30 fiVe percent of all your calories. They didn't eliminate anything in 2010. that's 2015. I think that's a factual error, chris. They clearly change a cholesterol recommendation to say as little as possible. They just didn't put a number on it. We all know that my cardiology group went bananas and got them to add that sentence as keep cholesterol as low as possible. Chris, it says cholesterol is no longer a nutrient of concern, but you were talking that they removed the total fat intake. That's actually inaccurate. It's right here. I mean, I'm going to get the guideline open, you know, it is. I mean, we're, we're, we're, we're allowed to make mistakes. We're trying to incorporate the whole world literature and we're just two guys. Was that a mistake, chris? Right here. I mean, it's a mistake. This mistake. What did he say? That we said that in 2010, the usda guidelines which are supposed to be followed by schools and colleges and the rest removed the total fat percentage recommendation. It remainS at 20 to thIrty five percent. That's fairly modest fat intake. I have to look at this, the specific

Speaker 5:          01:51:32       language to see. My recollection is that the, in the same way that there is some, a contradiction with the cholesterol. There's a sentence that says cholesterol is no longer a nutrient of concern. And then joel mentioned that he and his cardiologist friends got them to add something back that was, you know, kind of seem to step back from that. Um, and I think the same thing happened with total fat. I don't know, and I can't, I don't have it to look at right now. Can we? This is so because it's, it seems like it's a major point of dispute and joel says it isn't. It isn't because the the still the question at hand is what do the meta analysis of randomized controlled trials and what do the reviews, large reviews of observational studies, including over a million participants suggest about the influence of saturated fat on important markers like heart disease and total mortality. I'm still waiting to hear about a study that shows that eating more saturated, a convincing review of meta analyses, a meta analysis of randomized control trials or even large observational data that lasted for more than a short period of time that shows that eating saturated fat and I'm not even talking about in the context of a healthy diet, which is a whole other discussion, but just in any diet increases the risk of heart disease.

Speaker 1:          01:53:02       Can I stop you please? Because we were discussing this on the assumption that the usta had changed the requirements for fat joel saying that's a mistake. I really think we should clarify that. we should find out.

Speaker 4:          01:53:13       Choose my plate.gov. It's right here. Two thousand 15, 2020 questions about the usda guidelines. It said healthy diets can include up to 35 percent of calories from fat. They put a clearcut limit on it. It's right here. I mean, I'm reading it and not making it up. But. So usda, it's a government.

Speaker 5:          01:53:29       So what was it that you remembered from 2010 and did you remember it? Erroneously. Let's see here.

Speaker 4:          01:53:40       So fucking complicated. Oh, it's so bad. Yeah. Each vegetables, everything else follows and have some fun. Love your fellow man.

Speaker 5:          01:53:53       I have an anecdote. Can I. This came from a paper, it was talking about the um, the shift and the guidelines and I need to, um, you know, if, if, why don't you tell us,

Speaker 1:          01:54:06       don't joel, and we'll, uh, we'll get into this.

Speaker 4:          01:54:09       So I goTta tell ya, I love chris kresser. I want everybody to know that there's a very famous food doc in santa rosa named john mcdougal. He's been treated people with crazy plant based, high complex carb diets. He reverses diabetes. isn't that his newsletter came out just as I'm pulling up here and bumped into chris. We actually walked in exactly the same time. He quotes the new testament, and I'm going to read this because as a jewish boy, I just got to read it. One man. Faith allows indeed everything. There's some people around the table where they would do that. Another man's faith allows him to eat only vegetables. The man who eats everything must not look down on him. He eats only vegetables. That man who does not eat everything must not condemn. The man who does. There should be peace. I think that is such a freaking beautiful cats because we do need to leave here as promoters of healthy lifestyles, whether we call it the harvard school public health, how to live 14 years longer, the blue zones, how to live like loma linda, whether you want to eat game that you hunt, that is probably eight times less saturated fat than what you're buying at the damn grocery store.

Speaker 4:          01:55:10       You know people eat your vegetables. People be really quality over quantity and I'm going to tell you at some point, let's talk about eating less and taking some breaks for meetings so you can activate anti aging pathways, but um, because you know, it isn't all food. It's sometimes too much. Food is probably one of the biggest problem for sure. Sure.

Speaker 1:          01:55:26       For sure. whether we all agree about that. I think the real question is for someone like me who really doesn't know. Yeah, I am. I'm baffled by the saturated fat dispute because it seems to be there's one of you has got to be wrong here. The evidence has got a point. One or the other. Chris is saying the evidence points to be not an issue at all and you're saying your points to being a major issue worldwide consensus worldwide consensus, one of these groups that rely on current science that may or may not be behind the times.

Speaker 5:          01:55:58       Oh yeah. And I want to step back and just clarify my position here because I'm not saying, you know, we started by saying there's no one size fits all approach. Right? So these studies just tell us about averages. They tell us what happens on average when a group of people do something, they don't tell us actually what happens for person a, person b, person c, and that can be different. So if you get, like, some people may experience a slight increase in their cholesterol from eating saturated fat, some people might actually experience a slight decrease and on a net basis that averages out, right? Um, I think the next, the next generation of science is going to be more of an understanding of how various dietary components and various foods affect people on an individual level because let's say there's someone who's got genetic polymorphisms that, that mean that for that person, if they eat a diet that's very high in saturated fat, their ldl particle number, which is a risk factor for heart disease is going to go up.

Speaker 5:          01:56:59       I've seen that in my clinic. Absolutely. I'm not saying that saturated fat will never increased cholesterol or ldl particle number in people. That's just not true. And it will, it will, it will happen in some cases. Um, but I'm just, I'm reporting on the science, uh, as, in terms of the general question of is saturated fat going to increase the risk of heart disease and is it going to increase the risk of death on average according to the available research? And the answer to that is no. Now, then the next question is, should you joe eat a very diet high in saturated fat or should I or should jamie, that's a different question. And unfortunately science is not. we've been so focused on these population level recommendations and the idea that there's one diet that works for everyone and we don't have a lot of research that answers that question. That's a big gap in current science.

Speaker 1:          01:58:00       Two questions. One, did you find out if you made an error on this 2010 requirement from the usta? So

Speaker 5:          01:58:07       this came from a study that's, that reference said, despite a lack of evidence supporting low fat diets only in 2010, did the dietary guidelines committee stop recommending limits on total fat? Um, but I don't have the full guidelines in front of me and, and I, I'm not sure what the language says so I could have made an error. It's possible.

Speaker 1:          01:58:28       Okay. so you made it based on that, what you just said, that was what assumption in another study now in terms of saturated fat isn't there are an increased risk when you consume fat

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       with refined sugars? There absolutely is. This is another example of where it's at. Mcallen is context matters. Well, let me just even step back a second and say that the primary sources of saturated fat, and this is important to understand when you're looking at epidemiological data, so the sources of saturated fat in the american diet, 33 percent comes from pizza, desserts, candy, potato chips, pasta tortillas, burritos, and tacos. I'm 24 And a half percent is unaccounted for, but most likely processed foods according to the authors. And then 10 percent is almost 10 percent sausages, hot dogs, bacon, ribs and burgers. So the vast majority of saturated, oh, a 13 percent is chicken and mixed chicken dishes. I think kfc or chicken nuggets and eggs and mixed egg dishes, so the vast majority of saturated fat that americans are eating is coming from junk, right? So even in an observational, even if we did see an increase in harm from saturated fat and observational studies, we still couldn't say that that would be true for someone who's eating what I would call like a neutral board diet, which is, you know, whole foods, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, and some starchy plants like sweet potatoes and animal products including saturated fat.

Speaker 5:          02:00:11       We have no research that suggests that saturated fat in that context is harmful. What is the mechanism that makes saturated fat more harmful when it's consumed with sugar? Well, you have a, there is an interesting study that was done, um, by, uh, that showed that in the context of a key to genic diet where there's no, no sugar essentially or very low amounts of sugar, that dietary saturated fat will actually decrease blood levels of saturated fatty acids. And that if you're eating refined carbohydrates, then you, um, uh, you see an increase in saturated fatty acids that comes from, um, the effects of insulin essentially. Um, let me find you the specific. So if you're eating a high carbohydrate diet, it will, uh, increase insulin which inhibits the oxidation of saturated fat. And So then when insulin levels are high, saturated fat tends to be stored rather than beIng burned as fuel. And then high carb diet can put an, and I'm mean, refined carbs here, not, um, fruits and vegetables can promote the synthesis of saturated fat in the liver. So it actually causes the liver to make more saturated fatty acids in the serum. But this study here is a, this showed that a controlled feeding studies have shown that refined carbohydrates,

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       I'm, will actually increase levels of saturated fat in the blood. Whereas eating saturated fat in the diet does not. If they're, if the diet is not high in those carbohydrates. Joel, what's your take on that? Uh, you know, the only key point I make to answer your question, chris, is why does high sugar diets combined with high saturated fat diet? It's because, again, go back to biochemistry. This is serious science. we're saturated fat. It's usually found in meat and other animal based products. It does exist in plants like a seminar, avocado, salmon, and the olives and olive oil. But anyways, there's a pathway, get insights, but it's real stuff. The pro, the amino acids found in red meat out combined with their saturated fat. That's content triggers a pathway that accelerates aging. You don't want to age fast. That's called mtor pathway, the igf one pathway.

Speaker 4:          02:02:30       Then you eat a diet rich in sugar. Well, we know about chemistry right here in los angeles, university of southern California. Bow gerontology institute. Eat a lot of sugar. You activate another aging pathway called a pk ras, and these two pathways, mtor, igf one, pk rest will make you an old man or an old woman quicker. So when you're eating pastries, which is high saturated fat and high sugar, or you're eating a meal with a coke, how common is that? I mean, my god, a hamburger and a coke, you're activating everything we know about science that will make you age faster. That sucks. So is that true? That eating meat and the amino acids accelerate the aging process? There's no studies that show that eating meat in the context of a healthy diet shortens your lifespan. And if, if so, if that were true, then we would see that in the data.

Speaker 4:          02:03:21       But joel, you're talking about an actual physical mechanism that accelerates the aging processes as well known that, you know, what is it called again? Well, it's empty. Your igf one is one pathway. And pk rest the chemistry is not. I mean, this is like high level science. It's not, I'm not, I'm not stretching on the limb here. But um, you know, protein is really amino acids. You know, I get this question, you're a vegan. Where'd you get your protein? My answers. Where do you get your amino acids? Because my body breaks protein down into the building blocks and then I build a backup to wherever the hell I needed for its, you know, acids in meat. There's amino acids in my head, a mommy, wherever I want to get them. The the split of those 20 amino acids is different and meat than it isn't at a mommy.

Speaker 4:          02:04:02       There's more methodically and in a more loose and very technical stuff. Leucine, and there were some mixes that branch chain amino acids of lucy and I don't know what the hell that does your aging, but we do know that meet rich in matthias. Then we'll activate mtor and igf one, and it is a very strong factor in aging. You want a low mathiasson and diet, so another reason, plant based eaters, you need to take be 12 to keep their homocysteine to methionine and down. That's a separate topic, but yes, the amino acid mixed found in animal protein is different than the amino acid mixed found in vegetable protein, which is why when morgan levine looks at the question, what is your survival? What's your cancer risks? Which are heart risk on animal protein and plant protein? Plant protein beats the crap out of animal Protein.

Speaker 4:          02:04:45       This is high level cell metabolism. Try and publish a paper in cell metabolism. Beat the crap out of animal protein because there's a 300 to 400 percent increase in cancer of those diets concentrating on protein of animal source and there's a 25 percent reduction in cardiovascular disease cell metasys in 2014 morgan levine of harvard. Nobody's questioning or work october one, 2016 song at harvard animal protein plant protein lead to very different outcomes in large database observational studies at the highest level because you can't take 6,000 people in, randomize them in that way. So if you're waiTing for that to resolve the question, you know, good luck.

Speaker 5:          02:05:23       Actually not the case cd I irc panel that confirm that concluded that that processed meat led to an 18 percent increase in cancer risk, which again is like indistinguishable from chance using that low of a relative risk. They. Their conclusion was that the fresh red meat lead was a point zero to one point zero two. That's a two percent increase in many other studies have shown that unprocessed red meat is not associated with increase in cancer risk and is not associated with increase in heart disease risk. So again, you can talk about these proposed mechanisms all day long, but if it's not showing up in actual events that are meaningful to people, then you might be missing something. Maybe red meat does act in certain way that you might think would increase the risk of death, but maybe it does other things that reduce the risk of death. And that's why we can't just focus on mechanistic studies. We have to look at actual endpoints that matter to people

Speaker 4:          02:06:25       in terms of the quality of animal testing cancer matter. Chris and I know you know,

Speaker 5:          02:06:30       said they don't know. The studies don't show that fresh meat increases the risk of fresh red meat increased the risk of death and cancer and heart disease.

Speaker 4:          02:06:38       Joel, what was the number that you were saying? 300 percent. It's ready to anybody. Look, March 4th, 2014 cell metabolism. Morgan levine, right here. Animal protein. Seventy five percent increase in death. Four hundred percent increase in cancer over 18 year followup. These findings were not found with plant based protein. So let's talk about reviews. You're gonna reveal giants. This is reviews our science tool. You're saying that reviews of observational studies and reviews of med analyses are not science if you would prefer to draw conclusions based on a single study? No, not that I wouldn't want to a single state, but this is very consistent with the overall high level of igf one. pk, I was

Speaker 5:          02:07:19       just referring to research that several large reviews that have not found a relationship between red, fresh, red meat and cancer and fresh red meat and heart disease, so professor to look at reviews. That can include lots of studies and just a single study that supports a particular viewpoint. Maybe.

Speaker 2:          02:07:40       Maybe, maybe, but we need more than. Well, okay. The 300 percent, what does that. Let me let. It's it's human study. These are real lives. These are real desks and these are real cancer cases. This is. This is the original science and in one of the highest level of epidemiology where they don't take into account all the other risk factors and then the rest of their diet, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, all the burial. I'll answer in a second to download the whole paper, but you know, they do that. They do multivariate

Speaker 5:          02:08:10       noting that there is a 2011 meta analysis of 34 prospective studies on red meat and colorectal cancer, which said the event that's 34 studies, the available epidemiologic data are not sufficient to support an independent and unequivocal positive association between red meat intake and colorectal cancer. um, 2015 meta analysis, um, did find a relationship with processed meat but did not find a relationship. Uh, with fresh red meat is also an issue of dose response. If we, if red meat did cause cancer, then you'd expect to see a continuous increase in cancer rates as the intake of red meat increased. But in many cases you actually see the opposite. You can see a decrease in cancer rates and the people who ate the most red meat, which cast some doubt on that association. Um, and again, we come back to the relative risks. It like, uh, you know, uh, even with processed meat, it's only 18 percent and you have to consider the healthy user bias that we talked about before. And with fresh red meat, it's either nothing, zero or maybe like two percent. And that's just like that level in observational research is not distinguishable from chance. You cannot draw any concluSions on that and you cannot assume that someone who's eating a nutrient or diet with fresh whole foods and is including some red meat in that diet. It's going to have the same response as someone who's eating pizza, candy hot dogs, and all kinds of other, uh, junk food that's just not, you know, common sense will tell you.

Speaker 2:          02:09:46       Hence the problem with these kinds of stuff. Exactly. Joel, chris, do you want a low igf one are. Hi jeff. One you want to low igf one? You know, just say I want to live a long, healthy life.

Speaker 5:          02:09:58       I don't, I don't want to be, I don't want to be. I'm obsessing over individual markers. I want to live.

Speaker 2:          02:10:04       I feel like a lot of markers when it comes to low carb steady, she wanted a low igf one for survival. The scientists strong. This is la science, so we're not making this stuff up anyways. My thigh and into leucine and meat raises igf one and at least periodically take a break. Um, raises insulin growth factor, which will take your press prostate in your breast tissue, makes it start growing at age 50, which is the. Yeah, because it's our males are for women, for women. Well, just because the frequency of breast cancer women, it's women. So you know, there is a relationship

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       between animal products. In breast cancer, there's a opposite relations. These are relationships. There is, there are his petri dish. Let me just say, go back about chemistry. You take breast cancer cells in a petri dish, you put plant proteins, they stopped growing. You put animal proteins, they start growing. That's as pretty good science. Now you say that's a petri dish. They happen to be human breast cancer cells, but until you do a randomized controlled study of animal versus vegetable, they won't be done. Should a breast cancer patient eat more broccoli? Yeah. Let's dong the bell there again for sure. And I can tell you how to book cook the broccoli so they get the best benefit. Eat broccoli sprouts. She kept 50 times more than

Speaker 5:          02:11:09       benefit that broccoli. You were going to respond to that. Yeah. All right. Come back to important endpoints, total mortality or death from any causes. Um, and diseases I'm not, I'm not persuaded by mechanisms unless they're tied to outcomes that we care about. I think mechanisms are interesting, but as I said, if, if you, you have to be aware that if foods have multiple effects, they might have one impact that you might think would lead to harm, but then they could have several other impacts that would be beneficial and that's why you need to look at the real outcomes because there've been so many examples in the past of, of, of ideas where the mechanism that was originally proposed for the harm doesn't turn out to be what we thought it was. And so a total mortality is the most important endpoint. Deaths from all causes, but then also deaths from from specific conditions are important too. And you and I would put that higher in the hierarchy of evidence and mechanisms. Absolutely. Joel,

Speaker 4:          02:12:14       I don't know how you abandoned the unbelievable dedication and explosion of scientists around the country and around the world to come up with mechanisms of disease because we're on the verge of this unbelievable breakthrough to change your genetics and alter your mechanism. If you don't understand them, you can't do it. I think chris has it backwards more commonly. Basic science drives Questioning a human population and epidemiologic study and then maybe a randomized clinical trial that's usual progression. Um, for example, we have not even talked cholesterol. This literally has been all saturated fat. Nineteen 75. My mentors in dallas, Texas, but this is relevant in 2018. Brown and goldstein basic science. Identify your liver cell has a receptor called the ldl receptor. Nobody knew it. It completely controls the metabolism of cholesterol in the body. They then find that there's a disease where you don't have that receptor in your clusters. A thousand and you die before you're 15. And I took care of those children in dallas, Texas in 1986, 1989. From that came the development of a drug called mevacor and lipitor and lovis. Dad and all the rest, and we were able to test in humans. Does that basic science make a difference? Kaboom. The forest study says you live longer. If you have heart disease, you need to take a step. Yeah, there's side effects. Yeah. There's this and that. Go down to the bottom line. You want your ldl cholesterol. Like loren, the founder

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       of the modern paleo movement said 50 to 70 and it's all consistent across epidemiology. Basic biochemistry, randomized clinical studies, and what's the average ldl cholesterol and 100 gather in okinawa in loma linda. Ldls are 70 or 80. In fact, humans are the only free living animal on the planet with an ldl cluster over 80 [inaudible]. We eat and we gorge and we have jacked up saturated fat that drives our cluster up. We're the only animal on the planet and we're suffering terribly from policy there does saturated fat raises.

Speaker 5:          02:14:04       That's the hope we need to keep coming back to dietary cholesterol and dietary saturated fat. The evidence is showing that on average they do not raise cholesterol in the blood and even when they do that, that doesn't translate into an increased risk of heart disease. That's what the data show we've talked. I mean, I don't know what more I can say. Well actually we haven't. We have a nutritionist I call bullshit on that. It's called the heck aesthetic equation. In the keys equation. I shared the data on controlled feeding you. You mentioned metabolic ward studies is as a high standard of evidence controlled feeding studies where 75 percent of people experience no change in their blood cholesterol from eating to four eggs a day and not exit an isolated topic because that's a cholesterol topic. We have not talked cholesterol. We've been talking saturated fat. We talk to them about it right now. Okay, well, but you just asked saturated fat and I'm nervous.

Speaker 2:          02:14:59       Cholesterol, well, just saturated fat, raised blood cholesterol to deny that is is whack and I'm sorry. That's called the aesthetic equation. Google it. Look it up on wikipedia. It's called the keys equation. That change and that change in saturated fat raises choLesterol in the blood. Yeah, it does. It's known. It's what chris is saying that it

Speaker 5:          02:15:23       does. No, I'd say I say it does some times to some people, but on average the studies are saying that it doesn't have a significant mr. Right?

Speaker 2:          02:15:32       Get a large enough group of people, you'll have some aberrations and some people will find a significant raise. A rising of their cholesterol.

Speaker 5:          02:15:40       Yeah. And that again, more importantly people that the presumption here is that serum cholesterol where we care about it because it will increase your risk of a heart attack, as I said before, large studies that have been forgotten about cholesterol. Just analyze the relatIonship between saturated fat intake and heart attacks, which is what everyone cares about, right? If they're thinking about cholesterol is like the middle is, is a, um, a mediator in that situation. So they removed that and they just say, does eating saturated fat increase your risk of heart disease? Not large review of 350,000 participants did not show a relationship on average.

Speaker 2:          02:16:19       So is the concept that cholesterol is just one factor and that perhaps we've isolated it as more significant

Speaker 5:          02:16:26       and then it really is in our typical reductionist paradigm. Absolutely.

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       There are many factors that contribute to heart disease and that's one of them. Um, and so that's why again, it's important to look at the studies that directly examine the relationship between saturated fat intake and heart disease. Rather than doing this dance where we go, does it increase cholesterol? And then assuming that high cholesterol will lead to heart attack. Joel, I'm sure you can understand why this is so confusing for me. I, I actually feel really badly for your viewers and listeners. No, no, they're going to be able to go over this with a fine tooth. This is so important. I thank you both for doing this because this is the kind of conversation that you just don't get to have. We get to experts with opposing views and you have a decent conversation where you go over all the actual details of it and you get to see how each one of you thinks about these things and how you've drawn this conclusion.

Speaker 4:          02:17:19       I agree With that actually. I think it's great and all, but you know, we've had a couple moments of clarity and advice and I just want people to have as many as possible because it does matter wHy a friend of mine says heart disease is not theoretical. I mean we've had many 39 secOnd desk. We've been doing this. So just to respond. I mean, does saturated fat rich diets race class? I'll. Absolutely. It's such a tight relationship. There's a line with a correlation that just straight up now.

Speaker 3:          02:17:47       Can I pause you for a second? Yeah. Why? What is wrong with these studies that he's showing that, that show that it doesn't in most people?

Speaker 4:          02:17:55       No, I believe, and again there are studies that are being referenced but we're not looking at and that's a limitation we can live with that since 2010 the question has come up, does an increase saturated fat causes coronary heart disease? And that has been questioned in some studies. The idea that it doesn't raise blood cholesterol is a to it. It's the reason all the guidelines up there, 2015, 2016 still say limit saturated fat because that science hasn't changed. There's such a tight correlation. The line is straight up. Percentage of dietary fats presented dietary saturated fat, blood cholesterol, blood cholesterol, the challenges, how much yours is going to raise and how much mine is going to raise going depending on your genetics and your microbiome and where you're starting. If I ate a steak, my cholesterol goes up. If I ate an egg, this has been shown because I don't eat any dietary cholesterol is a plant eater.

Speaker 4:          02:18:43       My cholesterol skyrockets. You become habituated eating two, three eggs a day in the curve flattens out after two, three eggs a day, which is four or 500 milligrams of cholesterol a day. It's like if you smoke 20 cigarettes and you go to 24, going to be pretty hard to show. Much of a difference to three eggs a day for a chronic dieter is tough to challenge your body, just creates a tolerance for it is there's a level of absorption that starts to level off, but I'm an interesting statistic. A toothpick is 100 milligrams. Most of us eat three to 400 milligrams of cholesterol day three to four toothpicks. We're talking, we're talking fat. We're talking 150 grams. So that's why the saturated fat, it's like overwhelmingly more of a topic than three to put three to four toothpicks of cluster holiday.

Speaker 5:          02:19:29       Okay, hold on a sec. Because he'd just come back to the studies. Two to four eggs a day. Controlled metabolic word feeding studies do not have any impact on blood cholesterol in 75 percent of people. That's pretty. That's about as conclusive as the evidence can get. Well and reverends. Okay, I'll give one to you. I always have it. And in they're always there at [inaudible] dot com slash rogan. Yeah. No, and here it is. If you, if you google kresser saturated fat, you'll that the first article that comes up. So this is [inaudible], uh, from 2009 dietary cholesterol and coronary artery disease. A systemic review.

Speaker 4:          02:20:19       I'll just show I know your viewers. Maybe your viewers can see it. I don't know. That's called saturated fat in the diet. That's called changing your ldl. That's called the line going up like a straight rocket

Speaker 5:          02:20:30       and that will have jamie pull it up on the big screen.

Speaker 4:          02:20:34       Yeah. Anybody that googles it's called heggstad equation egg

Speaker 5:          02:20:39       t e d dot. He's from the late 19 seventies. This was, I know, but the heggstad equation comes from a heg said, who was one of the doctors who was involved with the mcgovern report in 1977, which was the original report that led to the limitation on dietary cholesterol and saturated fat. So, um, I think that's a little bit outdated perhaps. Like I said, you know what joel just said though, if metta now, as I said, one study doesn't, you know, the exception doesn't make the rule. We have a med analysis of observational studies including 350,000 participants that found no relationship between saturated fat intake and cardiovascular disease. The review of 25 rcts and 40 observational studies, 650,000 people that concluded that replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat doesn't lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. We have to look at the weight of the evidence.

Speaker 5:          02:21:44       We can't just choose one study or a mechanistic argument to support our view. I mean, what's your take that this study is flawed and out. It's not a study that's, uh, that's, uh, he was, uh, an equation that was meant to represent the relationship between saturated fat intake and a blood cholesterol that was created created by a in, in the late seventies that was originally involved in, in this diet heart hypothesis and the mcgovern report which led to the restrictions on cholesterol and saturated fat in the first place. So yes, I am saying that we should be looking at more recent evidence, large reviews of meta, of observational studies, then meta analyses

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       of randomized controlled trials. that's, that's the much more persuasive source of evidence for me,

Speaker 4:          02:22:32       joel. it was based on metabolic ward, carefully done studies at harVard. It was the equation derived from human data and where you put people in changing their diet, dietary change studies drives up ldl cholesterol ads, plotted out complaints, very clear. It's changing cholesterol to dietary saturated fat. It's well accepted in the medical community and it's incorporated in the guidelines. It'll never change. Human physiology is not gonna change. Ldl receptors don't change. It all goes back to basic biochemistry and when we understand that we can manipulate it to better health, we can do it through pharmacology. we can do through diet, will be doing it through gene therapy, stem cell therapy, but we don't understand about chemistry. We're cuttIng out a pillar. We have to have for better health. Chris,

Speaker 3:          02:23:16       I don't know how many more times I feel like I'm just saying the same thing over and over again. We have to look at the research, that weight of the evidence. We have to look at randomized controlled trials that actually look at what happens when people consume saturated fat and dietary cholesterol. These studies as the mechanistic arguments are not persuasive. If it's not happening in real in real people. You're measuring in a randomized controlled trial. You're controlling, you're measuring what happens when people eat saturated fat and cholesterol, and then you do a meta analysis of these controlled trials and you're finding what I what I just said, that's way more persuasive to me. What is your take on that?

Speaker 4:          02:23:56       Joel? The royal academy of the same, just the royal academy of saying, since we can give the nobel prize in medicine for what we're talking about and nobody's changed that. I mean I totally disagree with chris, that human physiology didn't change from 1985 nobel prize to 2018, that it's that relationship between eating saturated fat, lowering your ldl receptor, raising your blood, ldl, developing atheroma. I go in at three in the morning and bust open. Your plaques you live has not changed. Well, how are these studies made and what's wrong with them? Then the. Nothing's changed about understanding the biochemistry of metabolism and cells. Of course, there's always advancements, but uh, the ldl receptor has led to the staten field, a new class of drugs called pcsk nine inhibitors. It's all because of the biochemistry that people are living longer, living better. There are plaqueS are being reduced through lifestyle medicine. But thank god we also pharmacology that's advanced

Speaker 3:          02:24:57       wrong with these studies, these studies that are showing these results that he's descrIbing, that you're disputing what is wrong with these studies and what is wrong with their results. Results.

Speaker 4:          02:25:04       Again, I would urge everybody to take the broad, high level view of science and not pixels. What's the basic biochemistry and now we're circling around what's the epidemiology with the Clinical randomized trials and what's a centenarian studies there? There is no new data that you live to 100 by adding saturated fat to your diet. You may. We're not talking about that.

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       We're talking about the actual physical results on human bodies. When you consume saturated fat, what he's describing,

Speaker 4:          02:25:31       take a new metabolic ward study that negated

Speaker 3:          02:25:35       keys equation, the state equation that there's linear relationship. Three hundred 95 metabolic says it doesn't exist. What are you saying to that, chris? A metabolic ward study that says eating saturated fat. It would not take a job where we have randomized controlled trials which is a very high standard of evidence and observational data, large amounts of observational data that have been reviewed that answer this question and we we also, we have many rcts of low carb diets and even ketogenic diets that are not showing a significant impacts that. Joel, is it possible that this is, here's a dietary, here's a 2018 review of all of the previous science on dietary cholesterol in eggs, and the conclusion says, reese overall recent intervention studies with eggs, recent, uh, demonstrate that the additional dietary cholesterol does not negatively affect serum lipids, and in some cases appears to improve lipoprotein particle profiles like have a beneficial effect and hdl functionality which is the so called good cholesterol.

Speaker 3:          02:26:40       And he talks about here in the conclusion that eggs shift ldl particles to the less detrimental large buoyant ldl, which is less atherogenic. He says eggs also typically increase hdl. He says that eggs probably have other beneficial impacts on in terms of their phospho lippitt, contact qa, and that there's no relationship between the consumption of eggs and heart disease. So thIs is a 2018 review. It's by christopher blessed. So dietary cholesterol, serum lipids and heart heart disease. Are eggs working for and against you published in nutrients? Joel, is it possible that that's correct and that there's some misunderstanding about the previous data?

Speaker 4:          02:27:25       It's a different topic. It's eggs, it's cholesterol. We were talking saturated fat. Does It raise your cholesterol? So they're different topics and then we've introduced a very hot topic about ldl particle size, which we should break down and talk about. So I'm not sure quite how to respond because we

Speaker 3:          02:27:38       got off track by shifting to consistently low carb and the eggs and other things. We were talking about cholesterol, what we're talking about

Speaker 4:          02:27:47       raised blood cholesterol. So I'm, I stand by the fact human physiology will not change.

Speaker 3:          02:27:53       We have receptor understanding of human physiology advance.

Speaker 4:          02:27:57       Um, I don't. Well, I'll give you an example. Until 20 years ago nobody ever heard a word pcs canine god or somebody gave us a protein in our blood. Pcsk nine that goes to your Liver, sits in a receptor, causes the ldl receptor to go internal and you're frigging blood cholesterol goes up. Now there's a class of drugs that's an antibody to pcsk, lowers your cholesterol draMatically, and we're finding it reduces plaque and lowers your risk of heart attack. Sure. New science. Amazing. Totally consistent with what brown and goldstein showing that led to statens. Now we have a new treatment. That's a wonderful thing. It didn't rock the boat a, we still don't know to this day why we have that a protein in our Blood and if you're lucky enough to be born with a low level of pcsk nine, your cholesterol is lower, you have less disease, you live longer.

Speaker 4:          02:28:47       That was part of the data I published in 2012 with brian ferentz at wayne state university. So yes, we've learned more about human physiology. Totally consistent, didn't disrupt anything and lead to better treatments. That's great. Um, has, has human physiology been challenged? I'll give you another. We've learned, and chris menTioned this, I think it's fair to go there. It's like a court of law. he opened it up. I'm cross examining nobody in the world ever heard the word of four letters. T m a o 2011 cardiologists sitting at the cleveland clinic said, there's got to be more in the blood that hurts arteries. Let's go find him. They found this chemical. They learned how to measure it. They patent and how to measure it. Tmao. They took 4,000 people on the cath lab table. They said, I wonder if the level of tmao and the blood correlates with how clogged up your arteries are, but doom.

Speaker 4:          02:29:32       It worked perfect. Then they figured out if you eat red meat that has rich in l carnitine amino acids, you eat exits rich and coleen and a nutrient, I think amino acid and blanket for a minute. Those directly led your liver to create tmao. They took studies where they reduced carnitine, reduced coleen. The team mail goes down. What is tmao do it stunted your hdl so it doesn't reverse cholesterol transport. It causes ldl to enter the cell wall and create foam cells. Macrophages, plaque and you get a heart attack. It actually screws up your kidney and causes it to be fibrosis. If you have heart failure, diabetes, or heart disease or hypertension, you're tmao is up. I've actually drawn more tmao levels. I think any physician United States, this is my baby. New human physiology that has not led us to back off the idea that limiting the animal product consumption in this case specifically egg yolk and red meat may have benefit to your health.

Speaker 4:          02:30:23       We just learned in the academy, increased, went in diet, increases tmao orders of magnitude more hazard right in their fish flesh along with mercury and pcbs and ddt. What is the association of seafood intake with heart disease mortality? Can we use epidemiology studies or that they're off the table? As I said before, we can use epidemiology when we use it wisely, but selective chris use it or don't use it. I always use epidemiology. One hundred percent of the job. We've been talking about large reviews of epidemiology, that that suggests that heart, that saturated fat and cholesterol don't increase the risk of heart disease. So if you could answer Their question, is the association of fish with cardiova, what would most doctors and researchers say about fish consumption and cardiovascular disease and mortality was since it has saturated fat, most high level 2018 and advisors are two meals a week of

Speaker 5:          02:31:20       fish. Balancing out with 19 meals a week of plant based is the usda guidelines. Answer the question long. Can you look at the data? There are a few things that, that are associated with a greater decrease in cardiovascular disease risk than fish consumption of fruits and vegetables. Cmio is if you look at a graph and you can, if you google, um, let's see. Maybe jamie, you can pull this up. Kresser tmao. Um, and you click on that first link, red meat and tmao. You scroll down and there's a picture of jamie. Where are you? Ben? There's a picture a scroll down. I'm. There you go. So that picture shows the increase in tmao from eggs, beef, cheese, milk, clams, and then look at cod and halibut. Wow. Let me just see the reference data reference beef, the references in the article. Joel, as always, you can see it there, there jan referenced, that's not fair.

Speaker 5:          02:32:29       Chris, master john. Um, and not so cod and halibut or increasing tmao, as I said, orders of magnitude more than beef or eggs. You can't even see eggs and beef there. And the data show that fish consumption. I think almost every public health authority would recommend would agree with this, is reducing the risk of heart disease and mortality. So tmao Is another mechanism, it's another interesting mechanism, but not very understood. It's not fully understood and the, and again, we have to look at the data on red meat consumption and heart disease and mortality to to really figure this out. We can't, you know, it's a speculative mechanism. I don't disagree that it's important to look at mechanisms, but you can't draw conclusions based on them. And this single fact about tmao just kind of blows the thing apart. The other thing about tmao to know is that certain types of gut bacteria metabolize coleen and carnitine into tmao, whereas others don't.

Speaker 5:          02:33:34       And so a lot of scientists have speculated that high tmao levels are essentially a result of a disrupted gut microbiome. and that makes sense. If you have 60 percent of the calories that americans are consuming or from ultra processed food and we know that that totally screws up the gut microbiome. Then if you get a person eating a standard american diet, then they're tmao. Tmao levels may go up with red meat. Whereas if you take someone who's got a healthy microbiome because they're eating lots of plant foods that support healthy gut, then you may not see the same association and part of what supports that is a. There's studies showing that rifaximin, which is an antibiotic

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       that treats bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine, reduces serum tmao levels, which suggests that it's mediated by the gut microbiome. So consumpTion of fish has been universally shown to decrease heart disease. The mechanism is interesting, but overall it may be very complicated with many factors and we might not know all of them. Yeah, and then that's what takes us back to let's look at the data on whether red meat increases the risk of death or heart disease. Joel, uh, chris has referenced, was giving credit to another bloggers article. That's not science. You'd have to go to the bloggers article and look at it was number 16. There is. We have to find the reference. Sloppy referencing. Hold on, let him explain what the references said there that, that graph came. Explain number 15 is the reference dietary precursors of trimethylamine and man, a pilot study tmao.

Speaker 2:          02:35:18       Is that okay? So it's not a blog. It's actually a tmao is a hot topic right now that is largely being researched in terms of a egg yolk and meat consumption. It doesn't really matter. It's not preliminary science. No, no. It's not playing with science or coming up with pharmacologic agents right now to block it and we'll. We'll see a new class of drugs they were just reported. Is that with significant or is it more important to concentrate on gut biome and healthY diet? Well, why? Why are we. Why are we instantly giving the ball to pharmaceuticals? You ask the question, is there any new human physiology that's relevant? We've started with pcsk nine. I'm introducing tmao is new human physiology that's relevant that could lead to improvements in clinical outcomes as suggested by observation. We're talking about what he just showed him. The graph.

Speaker 2:          02:36:04       Dismiss the graph. Then he gave you a study for the graph and you just sort of glossed over it, right? I, I, I. The one that contributed fish is a flush source of tmao. we can talk about whether fish in 2018 is uniformly a healthy. I'm not saying, and he's also talking about gut biome, gut bacteria, then consumption of red meat being significantly less than the consumption of fish, which is universally said to be a good thing for your heart. A. So a bunch of layers there. Real quick, everybody who studies tmao knows that the microbiome is a critical component to people can eat a steak. It's classic study. Cleveland clinic study feed a vegan estate. This is a classic cleveland clinic research study in the new england journal of medicine. I don't make tmao why? Because my microbiome was different than yours feed and on the board of steak, they make tmao within 12 hours now eating a standard american diet.

Speaker 2:          02:36:58       Sure. But none the less, it's pointed to the fact that it was the microbiome you give a mouse meat and given an antibiotic that wipes out of microbiome a won't make tmao tmao dependency. The microbiome dependency of tmao is well known science. Um, so that, that is not denigrate the topic. I mean, it's a side topic. Is fish always healthy in a world of ddt? pcb mercury. I don't know about christmas practice, but every patient I see gets blood mercury levels and those that eat routinely heavy or very often, but that's another subject. That's another subject, but no, you don't want to. You want to look at old data on fish and now I'm bringing up 2018 clinical. That's not what he's doing. We're not bringing up old data on female beat up old data and I'm bringing relevant clinical materials about the absolute mechanism that's caused by the consumption of meat.

Speaker 2:          02:37:49       He brought up fish consumption which vastly elevates this and yet fish consumption is not correlated with heart disease. In fact, it's correlated with people having healthier hearts, so if you're suggesting to me is the recommendation today in this discussion, eat fish, but limit egg yolk and meet. I'd agree with that. That's not what it says because the fish consumption vastly elevates what you were saying was significant issue. He's saying it's not a significant issue, that it's a mechanism and it's an interesting mechanism, but it's part of a much larger and probably very poorly understood situation. I don't think that's completely true. What we do know is that true? Well, yeah, I would say that's true and I would say it's another proxy marker for crappy, crappy diet. What we know is that eating red meat and the context of a standard american diet, uh, may slightly raise your tmao but not nearly as much as eating fish will.

Speaker 2:          02:38:50       So you brought up this tmao and he's basically just squashed that argument, but I think he's a scientifically wrong because again, the wealth of the body, and I mean is that about tmao about female because what about the fish? Because a few specific fish, number one, the way that egg yolk and red meat, cleveland clinic, new england journal medicine is, is this a step of eden adjusting the precursor going through your microbiome, going through an enzyme called [inaudible] and your small intestine going to your liver as tma and green metabolize it tmao. That process is correlated with atherosclerosis, atherosclerosis. That process is correlated with increased activity of ldl within your cell wall, leaded by epidemiologists, bio chemistry, biochemistry. We know how it works in the petri dish. That was the brilliance of this rapid development from 2011 to 2013 to now, so it's not in fish.

Speaker 2:          02:39:41       It hasn't been studied is if fish flesh already has preformed tmao. We don't know if it activates ldl activation. We don't know if it's dones. Hdl. Nobody's looked at the correlation of fish flesh, preformed tmao, and a 4,000 patients studied in the cath lab table. We don't know they're wonderful questIons to ask, but until they're done, there is reason to be concerned that there's a new pathway that might be involved in athletes talking about a totally different thing. Yeah, exactly. If if consuming food that raises your tmao increased the risk of heart disease and you'd see people who are eating the most fish, having the most heart attacks, and that's the opposite of what you see that that's. I think that's reductionist because what does fish out reductiveness to bring up tmao in the first place because you brought her even more than what I just said because I zoomed out a little bit to look at the actual relationship with mortality.

Speaker 2:          02:40:35       Well, that was a blood level. That's not atherosclerosis, that's not outcome. That's not kidney function. That's not stroke risk and heart rates, which happens about tmao. I am talking about what that graph showed was tmao back it up. You eat red meat, you make tmao. If your microbiome is of a certain constitution, you eat egg yolk, you make tmao. If that's a certain constitution, is it good to have high levels with tmao and the blood, whether they're from fish, egg yolk, or red meat? The science of justice. Not good. What can you do to lower your [inaudible]? Let me pause you. Let me pause you. How does the science suggests it's no good. If there's large levels of tmao that come from fish and when you eat that fish, it's directly correlated with less heart disease. What it would take an evaluation. What's the calorie content of the United States from cod, halibut, red meat and egg yolk.

Speaker 2:          02:41:22       I would think the calorie content of egg yolk and red meat is higher than cotton helmet. I don't have that data and that's a global perspective, but if you are up to date in the scientists, say, I'd like to lead a lower tmao life, which again, I'm going to say with all boldness, I've drawn more blood levels on anybody in the United States. I believe according to the cleveland heart labs, you will want to do all steps to lower it and maybe you want to leave fishing because the complimentary benefit that fishes shown maybe from omega three speculative though we don't understand what you're talking about. Tmi te, te reo as a mechanism, right? It's purely speculative to say that the tmao from fish is healthy, but the tmao from beef and eggs is not. No, I don't think it's have. I don't think we know the answer because it's seven year old science, but you're stating it though.

Speaker 2:          02:42:07       Now I'm not saying that you're studying the tmao is a massive concern. That is scientifically true. How is it scientifically true? If there's so much tmao and fish and there's no concern? There's two species of fish that have the highest levels. You saw the other levels or whatever. They're the ones filling fish in general. This isn't rare fish and we're not, we're not talking about higher. We're talking about beef and eggs barely even register on that grass. Orders of magnitude higher. Like what percentage looked like 20 times. It was hiding. Yeah, I probably 20 fold higher. Twenty four, 20 times higher. Like I might've even mentioned that in my, in my original article. joel, the problem is you brought up to mayo in the first place. Like it was this. Well, but let me just tell you, okay, let's, let's everybody look at molecular nutrition food research. 2016. Does fish protein when it elevates tmao accelerated atherosclerosis according to a research study, when fish raised tml, they accelerate atherosclerosis. Anybody can check the lead author. I cannot

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       say the name yazdi gosh, dee. Conclusion reached, um, a, a petri dish. Data, uh, is a petri dish. I'm looking for a minute. It's basic biochemistry. What happens to atherosclerosis in arteries when you feed this was a mouse data. That's how you generate hypotheses. Well, it hasn't been done in humans yet. It's not such a thing as pure fact. Well, the assumption is the fishes a superfood. I've Already knocked It down for several reasons. One, the fish intake is associated with increased risk of diabetes. I'm sorry, that's epidemiology. Fish is here with inCreased risk of diabetes. Yes, it's got protein epidemiology studies. So the question is, is there a randomized study, basic biochemistry. You would understand that from the saturated fat content of fish. It would be largely epidemiologic studies, things like that,

Speaker 1:          02:44:03       but when you're saying epidemiology studies, you're asking people what do you eat on a regular basis and if they say fish and french fries and hot dogs, right? You say, oh, the fish is associated with an increase. That's where it can happen and it's not isolated.

Speaker 4:          02:44:22       It's connected. All the other things with that isolated what you're trying to isolate out things by multivariate analysis. Emmy is not one study, it's many, but diabetes and Fish really is that real? It's real. It's

Speaker 5:          02:44:34       review that said that and review because there's a 2012 review that does not find any association between fish consumption and diabetes. So you're thinking this is for 440,000 people with an average of 11 year follow up published in the american diabetes association, diabetes care journal. So I. Yeah, I don't think you know it. It's, it's hard I think to make the claim that fish consumption is harmful for the enormous weight of evidence and yes, there are concerns now about toxins then it might change over time and there are also issues with overfishing and all of that, but on different story we're talking about just the association of fish consumption and health and longevity. And I think if you've got 100 scientists in the room, maybe 99 of them would agree that that's a, that you know, there are a few things in nutritional research that are less controversial than that.

Speaker 4:          02:45:36       Well maybe, I mean I'm just, I'm not making this shit up. Journal, american college and nutrition intake of fish was correlated positively with the increased risk of diabetes. I mean the science is out there. Is it crystal clear as well defined as the head of state equation, dietary saturated fat changing cholesterol? No. Is it an association that could be of concern and basic biochemistry said, fish? You have saturated fat that could possibly caused something called lipo toxicity fish. You have animal protein. We've already talked where animal proteins very different than plant proteins. The concept is plausible. Sure. Is it resolved? It's not resolved. Is fish a better than eating

Speaker 5:          02:46:10       fried chicken or a piece of affiliate hoagie stake? Absolutely. It's upsetting. Just pull it up.

Speaker 1:          02:46:16       Then up here it says the findings is not supportive. Beneficial effect of total fish type of fish or epa and dha intake on the risk of type two diabetes. Alternatively, other dietary components such as selenium and unmeasured contaminants present, present in fish. Might explain

Speaker 5:          02:46:37       jamie, dude, read the sentence. Total fish intake was associated positively with the risk of type two diabetes that says there's epidemiology. That should be further studied, but maybe somebody wants to cut back their fish, but we're looking at a single study here to look at the weight of evidence. Jamie, you're bad man.

Speaker 1:          02:46:57       A minute. It says findings do not support a beneficial effect of total fish type of fish or epa dpa on the intake, on the risk of type two diabetes like it,

Speaker 5:          02:47:11       lean fish was associated with developing type two diabetes. Fatty fish was not because you probably want that omega three, but you know, I'm not telling anybody it's a resolved issue. Is that yours?

Speaker 1:          02:47:22       Sang tma from animal protein is what causes this problem? No,

Speaker 5:          02:47:28       it's actually more specific. It's coleen and carnitine in egg yolk. It's not really animal protein. That's. But you said the tmao tmao. Tmao is. Okay, so what's in meat? That's not good for you. although if you're hungry on an island and you're dying, eat meat, we all recognize it, but if you're looking for optimal health, you should be concerned about saturated fat content. You should be concerned that animal protein accelerates aging and igf one is it, but proven that animal protein accelerates aging. well. if he says no, we should just stop because that's it's world class science. I mean, just because you say it doesn't mean we did go visit a possibility that high intakes of mathias [inaudible], which isn't one of the amino acids in animal protein in the absence of sufficient intakes of glycine, which is another amino acid that's in animal proteins and an intake of nutrients like b, 12 and b, six and b, nine, which is full eight.

Speaker 5:          02:48:31       Could some of the animal studies suggest that that has an effect on longevity, but this is why I've always been an advocate of eating nose to tail, so not just eating lean meats that are very high and matthias and making sure you're getting enough of the glycine rich foods, the bone broth, et cetera, and then you're also eating plenty of, you know, a mixed diet that contains 12 and full eight and b six and the other nutrients that balance out the effects of excess. MatthIas matheny as well as fiber for a healthy gut. Absolutely. And when you pulled up that conclusion, no fiber in meat, no meat, yeah. Will you eat other things?

Speaker 1:          02:49:08       I've never argued. I've never bad except Sean Baker. Well, there's a whole nother ball of wax or that whole carnivore diet conclusions at accumulated evidence generated from this meta analysis does not support the overall inverse association of fish or fish oil intake with incidents of diabetes.

Speaker 3:          02:49:31       That'S saying that they couldn't confirm increase fish intake doesn't lower the risk of diabetes. It's not saying that it increases the risk.

Speaker 1:          02:49:39       So it says it's not a, there's no relationship there taking place. So it's not that no one's saying that it causes diabetes. So whatever it does. When, when, uh, where, where does it say that it causes diabetes? What does this study nobody said to. Cause this is classic association because you don't know if it's the protein, the fat, the mercury, the pcbs and ddt. The people that are fish die. Yeah. They're eating fish and chips. Tv. Absolutely. This is clearly not to the level of saying processed red meat causes cancer. This is saying fish consumption in some studies is associated with type two diabetes. These are heavily flood studies. Would you agree? I wouldn't throw them all under the bus. You know, that's how science works. I mean, it slowly plods forward, smiling.

Speaker 3:          02:50:25       Yeah, I mean we, we were starting, joe brought up tmao and then that's how we got onto fish in diabetes. I think there is no strong evidence that fish causes diabetes. Eating fish causes diabetes. There's a lot of evidence that suggests that eating seafood reduces significantly the, the incidence of cardiovascular disease. And again, if tma out were a problem then eating a lot of fish, it should not have that impact.

Speaker 1:          02:50:53       I believe that this is probably. Well I shouldn't say you believe. Do you believe this is from essential fatty acids that are found in fish, particularly fatty fish?

Speaker 3:          02:51:01       Yeah. I think that's plausible given what we know about epa and dha, which are the long chain essential fatty acids and their benefits and it could be fish is also a really great source of selenium as, as that one study said 16 and the tWenty five top sources of slain income from ocean fish. Fish is a great source of bioavailable protein. Um, there are lots of reasons why, why fish consumption could be beneficial. So

Speaker 1:          02:51:28       in your opinion, tHis sort of highlights that there's a lot of complex different moving parts that we dOn't totally understand and that this is why you don't want to rely completely on just the mechanisms and these things that are occurring in petri dishes or mice studies or

Speaker 3:          02:51:47       things along those lines. Yeah. So going back to the bradford hill criteria that we mentioned before, which are ways of kind of determining whether associations that should show up and observational studies might be causal. The plausibility one of one of the criteria is mechanism. Is there a plausible

Speaker 5:          02:52:06       mechanism that could explain the relationship between this variable and that variable? But there are other criteria, strength, consistency, specificity, temporality, plot, a biological gradient like a dose response. Um, coherence experiment analogy. So yes, mechanisms are great. We, it's important to study them. I'm all for that and we, we absolutely need to correlate them with real outcomes and real human beings to see both in observational studies that are well designed and in randomized controlled trials to see if it makes sense. And the tmao. I think it's a great example of that.

Speaker 2:          02:52:41       Does it, is it fair to say that we really just are looking at a puzzle and we don't have all the pieces? I think you can say that in many cases and in this case for sure. Yeah. I disagree that there's a tremendous group and you can pull this up. If we went jamie called true health initiative, it's more than 400, I'd call world experts on nutrition fairy divergent food philosophies, paleo mediterranean plants specifically disagreeing well so that there's no consensus to advise the public on a healthy diet for humans. They disagree. That's what we said. That's what we. What we said was that there's. It's a complex puzzle and we don't have all the pieces. Well, I agree with that, but we have enough to make recommendations because we have enough. We have enough to make recommendations to the public and the true health initiative has crystallized that.

Speaker 2:          02:53:31       Okay, but that's not what we were discussing right there about recommendations to the public. We were talking about mechanisms and whether or not it's understood all the different moving pieces in terms of how your body absorbs nutrients and food. It's good. It's an endless flow of new knowledge and that's what I said, but why? Why did you disagree with that? I didn't disagree with it. I completely agree with you. I disagree when he said that. That's an accurate assessment that we don't have all the pieces to the puzzle. We definitely go to have all the pieces. We have enough to make recommendations and then we'll reevaluate and all. Do you want another new meat problem? It's coolest. Latest science. Sure. Okay. Jamie, will you go to please meet allergy on google, university of Virginia, atherosclerosis. So little tolerance meat allergy. You wait and go to the second tick.

Speaker 2:          02:54:18       Oh, you got a baby. You are so good. Joe lactose, my gel. I am so overwhelmed by your science and I mean that sincerely. You see the one that says nih? It's a number to hit and google, but this is something that is caused by an adverse reaction to it. You've got to listener here who's in Virginia. Maybe you see a segue question whether the average person should eat meat though, but if you get started with this here, go ahead. So this is diabetes. I don't know if I'd go to the second one, you'll have the picture just real quick. Okay. You live in Virginia, you end up putting god. You're right. You end up, you end up on my cath table because you're in the emergency room for whatever reason. Okay. I draw a blood sample on you. Twenty four percent of those people have a antibody to alpha gal, which is a carbohydrate found in meat and that shocks people.

Speaker 2:          02:55:17       There are carbohydrates and mainly red meat specifically and only red meat, specifically 24 percent of Virginia and so the antibody, so that was interesting and some are now developing anaphylaxis, carrying epi pens because they've immediate allergy. that isn't two point four percent is 24 percent have the antibody, but what was discovered university of Virginia is if you then look at their heart arteries by ultrasound, the more plaque they have, the higher is there. Tighter the antibody brand new science. It's an association. Nobody knows there is of course the possibility of inflammation from immune activation. That's wild data. Now, I don't wish that on people. I wished we live in a world, but people didn't have nut allergies, didn't have lactose in towns and didn't have meat allergies, but the reality is there may be a pathway previous unknown that is hot, and this all goes back to your question.

Speaker 2:          02:56:04       Is there any new physiology about this whole stop you right there. This is a pathogen activated allergy that's from a pretty severe. People don't walk around with this without knowing that they have it. They have severe allergic reactions. It's basically like lyme disease, that lactic. We're not talking about like a mild gi discomfort when we're talking about us. I don't think this is a mechanism that has existed for a long time to explain anything, but this is something that's only been discovered over the last couple of decades. Of those 24 percent that have the antibody, very few had the full clinical syndrome, but it's still correlated with heart disease. The point is, keep an open mind. I don't see the data accumulate and getting healthier. can I ask you this? Do you think that it's because they have a mild case of this tick borne disease or this tickborne disease is like because it is fairly recent in terms of our discovery of it, is it advancing and evOlving and getting more potent?

Speaker 2:          02:57:00       I doubt you know, the basic biochemistry of meat and the carbohydrates and meet have changed. It has the. Has the lone star tick become more frequent naps, cross reaction between glyphosate and being bit by a tick and our intestinal permeability. There's all kinds of crazy ideas that need to be pursued because some of them will run santos round off. It's fair. It's, it's all their correlation is not causation. we know you agree with this job. We didn't have to keep that in mind. I mean it's that there's a great study done in one of my favorites. It was purposely done to illustrate the danger of assuming that correlation equals causation. It was a study done of the most common diagnoses for hospitalization in Canada. 10 point 6 million people and they found that 24 diagnoses were significantly associated with the participants astrological science, so people

Speaker 5:          02:58:02       who are born under the sign of leo had a 15 percent higher risk of being hospitalized for gi, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and sagittarians had a 38 percent higher risk of being hospitalized for an arm fracture. Now remember the the candidates, the proposed increase in risk of for for process meat and cancer is 18 percent, so these risks are on the process at the same process, meet at that same level so it sagittarian has a higher risk of being. If we believe in this correlation data, you know you can't assume correlations or causation. I mean that's basic and I, and it doesn't again, there extent you can use bradford hill and other things to strengthen the association, but you need to test it with an experiment or the association needs to be strong. It needs to be over 100 percent at least to really rise out of the noise and then say, okay, we're really seeing a signal.

Speaker 5:          02:58:59       Let me give you another example. There was a recent study just published that showed that women pregnant women with the highest maternal consumption of gluten had a twofold risk of type one diabetes and their offspring and their children. That was a double, that was over a hundred percent. So that is actuallY worth paying attention to because that's so such a large increase in risk that it doesn't confirm it by any stretch. But it does mean. Yeah, maybe we should look into this further. If that was a five percent increased risk, I mean, you, you, you, you might as well say that sagittarians have a higher risk of fracture. Is it fair to say that we're doing all these nutritional studies that you're looking at a poverty of data? Yeah, I'm johnny. Johnny enedis had a quote. Uh, let's see if I can quickly find it. Um, because we're comparing all these different studies and mean obviously joel thinks one thing.

Speaker 5:          02:59:58       You think another thing. So, so here's the, here's the end of this quote. Moreover, given the complicated associations of eating behaviors and patterns, uh, oops, lost my place. Given the complicated associations of eating behaviors and patterns with many time varying social and behavioral factors that also affect health. No, currently available cohort includes sufficient information to address confounding in nutritional association. So he's saying, you know, lay-person translation, there's so many factors that affect our health from our sleep to our physical activity to our, uh, whether we smoke, whether we drink your, our social relationships. There was a study that I think I talked about, um, one of my previous appearances that, that shows that I'm having not having enough good relationships will increase your risk of death more than smoking 15 cigarettes a day, no studies or controlling for that gut microbiome we now know is really important for our overall health. Are any sTudies comparing for pe? You know, actually controlling for people's state of people's got microbiome? Absolutely not. Which is a problem with the tmao research. So again, it doesn't mean that observational studies are not useful. It means we have to take them with a huge grain of salt and the fewer things that are actually controlled for the bigger, the grain of salt will be joe w.

Speaker 4:          03:01:20       I eman, I kind of had a sense that it's so overwhelming and there's so many spots in the data that we're unable to advise the public. Again, I don't agree with that. I Think we have more than enough data. you can go to michael polan, eat food, not too much. Mostly plants. Everybody loves it because it's consistent with the overwhelming 50,000 level. Look, you can go to the true health initiative that says 15,000 level look. Yeah, no. The whole level of biology, basic science, centenarian, randomized clinical trials, epidemiology. You got to talk to a patient monday morning. I don't want to get mired in confusion. I'm going to tell that patient eat real food. Don't eat too much and eat mostly plants because that is a synthesis of 50 years in nutritional research. are we going to evolve that to something more brilliant? You might add now fast five days a month or don't eat 12 hours a day.

Speaker 4:          03:02:12       We might be able to refine it with some of the new science on it using fasting intelligently, but that's pretty strong. When I go to the true health initiative and say it's all confusing, but 400 scientific international experts say, eat locally, source close to the ground per plant predominant with water. 400 scientists say that's pretty reasonable, that I can tell my patient on monday is something they can actually activate and we'll figure out tmao with a blocker with fish or with eggs with coleen or whether this tick allergy ends up spreading into Michigan or California. And There's a way to deal with it. For now. These are critically simple lessons for the public.

Speaker 5:          03:02:50       I'd actually agree with that. Including the part about plants. I mean, I recommend my recommendation is your plate should be, you know, two thirds or three quarters plants and, and then, and then animal products, animal foods. So the question here is not that, should we eat a healthy whole foods diet? We both agree on that 100 percent. The question is whether animal foods, uh, should be a part of the diet based on their nutrient density, which unfortunately we haven't had a chance to get into yet. And their bioavailability and the fact that humans in our hominid ancestors have been consuming them for over two and a half million years. Um, you know, that's my argument is that, uh, on that plate, for most people, they're going to benefit from having some animal foods. How much, you know, what proportions of carbohydrate, fat, protein, and all of that.

Speaker 5:          03:03:40       That depends on the person and you're going to see big differences actually from person to person. Um, but you know, I, I think today has made it clear there's no convincing data that shows that completely removing animal products from that plate going to lead to a longer life span or significant reductions in disease. Let me put it this way. What is the benefit of putting that one quarter of your plate putting animal protein? Like what, what Is the nutrient density of it that makes lots of benefits? Yeah. So, uh, animal protein is, um, more nutrient dense in essential nutrients. So, so making it clear that I, I, I support eating both plants and animal foods. So animals or animal foods are higher and be 12 bioavailable zinc, iron, calcium, a coleen taurine, creatine, and not just higher in terms of the actual amounts but higher in the amount that you, that you absorb.

Speaker 5:          03:04:47       And that's a very key point. whereas plant foods tend to be higher in carotinoids polyphenols, flavanoids, diallo, little sulfides which are in cruciferous vegetables and fiber and those are important as well. And so to get the best of, you know, the, the, the widest spectrum of nutrient density, we want to eat the animals for those nutrients in animal foods and then the plant foods for those other nutrients. And whaT would be negative about removing the animal products from that one quarter of your plate? What, what could you not fill in with plant protein a, b? Clearly some people get by with just plant protein b. 12 is the, is the biggest issue for sure. Um, it's not really found in plant foods except for some exotic species of wild mushrooms and, and nori and plants and mushrooms aren't really plants. Right? But yeah, in non animal foods, yeah, I guess you could say, um, but if it's not just a question of what's theoretically possible, it's a question of looking at the studies that show us what are the average, uh, you know, how common are nutrient deficiencies on omnivorous versus vegetarian and vegan diets.

Speaker 5:          03:06:05       And if you go to [inaudible] dot com slash rogan, there's a whole section on that that links to a very in depth article that shows that, for example, of vegetarians and vegans, the average omnivore, the rate of between depletion is 11 percent. And then for vegetarians at 77 Percent and for vegans it's 92 percent, 92 percent of depletion, which is the first stage. There's four stages of b, 12 deficiency. And that's the first stage. And the earlier studies that showed less of a difference used only crm b12 as a marker, but it turns out that crmb 12 is not a very accurate marker of b 12 deficiency. And we need to be using more accurate markers like holo, transcobalamin, methylmalonic acid, homocysteine. And when you use those newer markers, you see those broad, broad, you know, very big differences, deficiency rates and furthermore there was a study done in vegans and vegetarians in the Netherlands that were at a summer camp.

Speaker 5:          03:07:03       So these were people who were educated vegetarians and vegans, they were really into it and the average crmb 12 level for them even it was below 200, which is in a deficiency state. And even the people who were supplementing had significant levels of b 12 deficiency. And that's probably because studies have shown that the amount that you need to supplement with is about a 100 times higher than the rda. So the rda is two point five micro grams and you really need 250 micrograms to get your levels up. And if you're deficient you need 200 times more than the rda, 500 micrograms and this. All the studies are there on, on my site. So it is the problem that beat twelves nonexistent and plant based foods or that it's not as bioavailable. It's, it doesn't exist. The true, true cobalamin absorbable b12 doesn't exist in implant that you can't, um, you can get other koba minds, other forms of implant, even algae, even algae. Yeah. Most, most vegans who are well who were educated about this know this and they take a 12 suPplement. So, but the [inaudible] supplement is probably based on what, like what is it coming from? Well, it's not that, that, that doesn't necessarily make the difference. It's are they taking enough to meet your needs? So I hope that anyone who is listening to this make sure that they're getting enough b, 12, you know. RIght. But what is it coming from? If it's not active?

Speaker 4:          03:08:29       I make be 12 cows are eating dirty ground. they get bacteria, cows stored in their stomach plants if you don't wash will give you be 12. But it's the bacteria hanging on the carrot

Speaker 5:          03:08:39       and we make the 12 too, but It's in the colon and we can absorb it in the small intestine. Right. So, um, but yeah, just making sure that if someone is following this diet, they're getting enough b 12 and that they're using the right markers to assess their status. Crmb 12 only goes out of range In the final stages of b 12 deficiency and by then it can be too late some of the effects of b 12 deficiency or irreversible. So it's a pretty serious thing and it's, it's a really important thing for any vegetarian or vegan to be aware of, given those big differences in depletion, uh, between the population. So joel, if you been a vegan since you've been 18, obviously must've been on top of all the supplementation and making sure that you get your nutrients

Speaker 4:          03:09:21       well, it's out. Number one, it's responsible for a healthcare practitioner to advise somebody eating plant based to take vitamin b. 12. Absolutely. There are people that do it because it's fortified in many foods and nori, if you eat sushi and nutritional yeast, I don't advise my patients to rely on food because there's a neurologic and hematologic potential for trouble. If you don't be 12, it actually takes years to deplete your b 12. It's an interesting statistic. I want to come back to humans. Ninety percent of all b, 12 right now is being given to lock cows because they don't eat dirt anymore. They're inside a building that has no dirt. They dOn't get be 12, but the public wants be 12 rich meat, so they'd give be 12 to cows to make b 12. There is little vegans. These cows, they don't have a source anymore. No animal. They usually talking about factory farming, factory farming. You know if you're out there eating dirt in the field are going to have a college, have a job,

Speaker 3:          03:10:15       be right here. When you say that, so is it impossible to live a healthy plant based lifestyle without supplementation?

Speaker 4:          03:10:24       No. Many many people do, but if you're saying you don't remember amended, I don't recommend it, but they should get bloodwork. Know your vitamin d, no, your omega three and know your b 12. I'm all for optimal health and I'm practicing high level medicine, but I have friends that adamantly show me their blood work. I don't take pills and look at my blood work. I mean they may sneak by. It's not my medical recommendation. The fish and recommendations is every, everybody over age 50 and the United States take be 12 for brain and mental health, whatever your diet and that's a wise advice. Whether you take a multivitamin every couple of days like dr longo recommends there's, you know, this is a real problem. Nobody's denying that chris has laid it out. Well, it's such a simple solution. I'm going to demonstrate my be 12. What's the source of your [inaudible]? It's synthesize methological bombing. I just got 1000 micrograms of vitamin b, 12 with 400 micro with 400 milligrams of dha with 2000 international units of vitamin d three and I did vegan. I just did that once a day and I'm done. You know, and it's all vegan and has nothing to do with living organisms. It's made synthesized a, b. Twelve is synthesizing labs. MethylcobAlamin, some people believe is the preferred choice, which I think chris would agree with.

Speaker 3:          03:11:37       Contrary to popular belief, it can be gotten by completely humane and ethical ways. If you're a,

Speaker 4:          03:11:43       oh, it's lpg, it's lg for dha, it's synthesize for be tWelve and vitamin d three is synthesized to it used to be made from cows, a secretion called land, a sheep's secretion

Speaker 3:          03:11:53       called land limpets synthesize now, but it does beg the question of whether we should be following a diet that can't meet our essential nutrient needs and that leads to deficiencies of many other nutrients much more commonly than an omnivorous diet. And you know, my, my position has always been we should get as many nutrients as food as we as we can because that's the way that humans are adapted to getting new nutrients. There's issues with supplementation sometimes. Um, you know, both like getting too much of a nutrient is, can be a problem in several cases. That's not the case in b12, which is great because it means people can take really high doses and it won't be a problem. But as I mentioned, a lot of vegetarians and vegans who are supplementing are still at risk and still deficient because crmb b 12 is the main marker that is used in this country. And not even, most physicians don't test for cmv tWelve. I know this, you probably know this, joel from people come in, they've never had be 12 tests,

Speaker 5:          03:12:52       but then when they do get the cnb 12 tests, it's going to miss a large percentage of people who are already in the stage two. I do a methylmalonic methylmalonic. Yeah. So methylmalonic acid and homocysteine are much more important markers and I agree. If you look at average homocysteine levels in vegans and vegetarians are significantly higher than in omnivores because of this issue, because of the high prevalence of, of b12 deficiency. And what's ironic about that is a lot of people turn to a plant based, I don't even want to say plant based because I would consider a neutral or a paleo diet to be plant based to but uh, no animal product diet to improve their cardiovascular health. And yet you're seeing much higher rates. Your rates of homocysteine, like the average and vegans is 16, which is a rate that's clearly associated with increased risk of not only cardiovascular disease, but also dementia and alzheimer's. RighT.

Speaker 4:          03:13:46       Chris? I couldn't agree more. I've written many articles, don't be a dumb vegan and I don't mean to offend, but you know what you know you, you, we are prone and I mean there's no bullshit here. This is too important for people. We are prone to have a few holes in the wall that an intelligent person knows how to plug it. Vitamin d, it's dha, it's be 12. You might go onto say iodine touring vanadium, chromium. I just got those. That's what I do every other day. I'm totally complete. My patients are totally complete. The industry has provided solutions to a relatively simple problem. I don't. So you got a mouthful.

Speaker 1:          03:14:22       Let me ask you questions. Is, is it fair to say that you believe that What the vegan diet is like? You can essentially hack your way to a better, healthier life by just adding a few things like be 12, a few other nutrients that you're not going to get from the diet, but with those together you feel like you're far healthier.

Speaker 4:          03:14:43       Well, because what I didn't get, I substituted, but what I don't want, I'm not taking in, which is animal saturated fat animal protein. I'm not taking

Speaker 1:          03:14:51       main disagreement here between the two of you is whether or not saturated fat.

Speaker 4:          03:14:56       Chris and I would both agree as educators, all the public and specifically plant eaters should be aware of nutritional deficiencies. A two year paleo followup study said that people were deficient in iodine on the paleo diet. Sounds have much higher rates of iodine, but you know it's common in America. MucH higher

Speaker 1:          03:15:13       rates of iodine deficiency than paleo

Speaker 4:          03:15:15       unless you eat some nori, some kelp, unless use iodized salt. If you would just put

Speaker 1:          03:15:20       though that the paleo diet is the issue,

Speaker 4:          03:15:24       just people deficiency. Paleo diet goes back 10 to 12 years in literature. Two thousand nine is about the first good paleo. Sansa showed up and I honor the paleo diet. There is good reason to consider it as a food option. They'll us news and world report does not agree with that, but to say, what are they basing it on? They're not scientists. Well, their panel of scientists that they read it, they read it for lunch. The bigger question is just what?

Speaker 5:          03:15:50       You know what's going to happen for the average person who's following these diets and I agree 100 percent with joel that you know, we have to educate people on whatever diet they're on and I've, I've, I've said this to people, that's why I'm not, I've never advocated strict paleo be. I mean I think that can work for some people, but I've never been an ideological about that because I actually think that full fat fermented dairy is really beneficial when it's well tolerated and one of the reasons for it is iodine dairy is actually one of the best sources of iodine in the diet and it's not because the dairy products contain iodine but they're stored in tanks that were iota for is the cleanser that's used for the tanks. We basically pure just pure it. Interesting and, and gross. It's not, it's just, it's like, you know, the iodine you use to clean.

Speaker 5:          03:16:39       It's just a natural nutrient. Where do you get it from food though outside? So the three top sources of iodine would be. Well iodized salt is the main one. That's why it was added to salt in the first place, but a lot of people on a healthy diet remove iodized salt in favor of sea salt, which I think is a good choice overall, but one of the downsides of that is that there are no longer consuming the main source of iodine. Then dairy products and then sea vegetables, as joel mentioned, I'm like kelp and he jiechi and rma and, and no worry, not as much, which is the only sea vegetable that most americans consume in the form of sushi. Right? Um, so if you take someone on a, on a vegan diet or a paleo diet for that matter, and they remove dairy seat, a iodized salt and they're not eating sea vegetables, then yes, that is a risk for iodine deficiency.

Speaker 5:          03:17:26       I have written about that, but let's look at things like calcium. Let's look at iron. Let's look at zinc. Let's look at coleen. Let's look at taurine. Let's look at creotine. Let's look at retina, which is preformed vitamin a. And let's look at epa and dha. All of these are shown to be lower in vegetarians and vegans and they are in omnivores and it Just, yes, you can supplement, but it just, you know, are the supplements have the same effect, like look at calcium. dietary calcium has inversely related to heart disease and kidney stones, meaning the more dietary calcium you eat, the lower risk of those conditions. But when you look at studies on calcium supplements, the opposite is true calcium supplements are associated with an increase in heart disease and an increase in kidney stones. So associated by epidemiology studies. Yes, yes. So, but the theory is that because you went with the supplemental, calcium is not the same as dietary calcium. You get a large bolus of calcium that goes into your blood all at once and then it can get into the soft tissues which you know, can make them stiffer, which is joel will tell you is not good for your heart health. And so my point is that supplements don't always affect the body in the same way. That's why I just think it's better to get nutrients from food if you can, because that's the way we've been getting them for

Speaker 3:          03:18:48       millions of years, you know, let's talk about something I think you guys can both agree on because I am baffled by this carnivore diet. Yes. And baffled. I'm baffled by how many people are clinging to it as a panacea. I'm baffled by whether or not it's a physiological effect or whether there's a placebo effect going on. I have a theory please. Yeah. So my theory is that it mimics some of the benefits of fasting, but allows people to persist for longer because it's providing some nutrition. You know, most, if you look in the scientific literature, fasting is the cure. all for everything I agree with. you mean like you can look at any condition and fasting is the cure time, water fasting. So you can do it for two, three, four weeks. I tried that for a year and that will be the cure for life in that case.

Speaker 3:          03:19:42       The longest example is a year of water fest. So most people die. That last, uh, it was, he was extremely obese, a lot of energy stores, fat stores, right. Anything about that was he actually his skin shrank to. Right. Which is really, yeah. Which doesn't usually happen with weight loss, so this is just a theory. I have nothing to, you know, I don't have any evidence, but we meet as absorbed very high up in the digestive tract. And so when you only eat meat, it's a low residue diet and there's nothing leftover to irritate or inflame the gut. My theory is a lot of people who are benefiting from this have a really disrupted gut microbiome. Alessio fasano has argued that leaky gut is kind of a preconditioned for auto immunity and this, the carnivore diet is essentially like a gut rest or a fast. And so I don't know the out that people are benefiting from it. The question is what is the longterm implication? But there is no. I mean there's a few people that have been doing this, some anecdotal evidence. We've been doing it for a few decades.

Speaker 4:          03:20:43       Well, you know, it's pretty cool. I'm actually going on my homeboy sean baker's podcasts in a few weeks. We're humble. We started. Sean and I started as enemies. We love each other. Shannon, I love your brother. We're going to have an honest discussion as much as you can to say why has my Kayla Peterson feeling good and you got to love that and honor that. If she had done water fasting, transitioning to an ultra clean diet, which you have done as well, who knows, but to look at sean baker's labs and say prediabetic low testosterone high bun. I'm concerned, although he just published his coronary calcium scan to zero and I honor that he's got little kids. I don't want the guy to drop dead, but you know, there's it's way preliminary for the bandwagon. That's testosterone thing though is he said that he had been dead lifting the day before and the day before he took his test out of sydney. Significantly decreased testosterone. Well, he said he repeated it a few times and has stayed low, but if you're total raised, it didn't raise rates by 100 percent. No, it was. It was like 237, I can't memorize last, but there's little

Speaker 2:          03:21:46       though. There's plenty of data. If you're sharing a total testosterone was less than 250. It's an adverse mortality predictor and you know, he wants to be alive. He doesn't need to do it. Kayla peterson and Jordan might need to do it until they find a better path. Sean's, you know, uh, adopted it. So there's, you know, the biggest puzzle is quickly, quickly, one of the things that plant based eaters and people that fill three quarters of their plate with fruit and vegetables get way more than everybody else has lots of vitamin c and vitamin c builds healthy walls and build south immune systems. You love vitamin c? I love vitamin c, I love it from foods. I don't mind it as a supplement. I don't mind it. Intravenous vitamin c, linus pauling. There's so many, uh, benefits of the body. Where are these people? When every chart says that meat has no vitamin c, are they eating raw meat?

Speaker 2:          03:22:31       Which might've vitamin c? Are they eating organ meat which might have some invited? Let me stop you there because I'll tell you what the explanation has been. The explanation to me has been that there is a decrease in absorption of vitamin c when you're consuming vitamin c with all these other things. Cruciferous vegetables, carbohydrates, all these different things that there's some sort of a, there's an adverse effect. Is that, is that a fact? If you take a thousand milligrams of vitamin c will absorb a lot of, take 10,000 milligrams by percentage, you won't absorb as much, but you'll still get more than a thousand milligrams. But there's also this theory that sensor eating basically and no added glucose diet that there's some kind of competition in us between glucose and see. So even if they get a touch a c, they're absorbing it hyper efficiently. Nobody knows. They haven't developed getting clothes from glucogenesis uh, internally, right?

Speaker 2:          03:23:23       Because they're adding. Surely it's a low carb diet and elidel alpha gal in there. Maybe that's about the only I think. I mean, the point is we just don't know. We don't know. And, and I mean as a, as a practitioner myself, and as someone who's dealt with chronic illness who wasn't able to find help anywhere else, I mean, I, I do not be grudged people for sticking with something that they've tried everything and nothing has worked and they do this and they feel good. I mean, who can blame Them? It's a dinner with Jordan, Jordan Peterson. He's eating these big giant stakes and he looks great. He's lighter than he's been since he was 20 and I'm, I'm 100 percent empathetic with that because I've been through something like that myself. But to then take that and say that we're certain that it's safe is a big leap.

Speaker 2:          03:24:10       And so, you know, my field atherosclerosis takes years to develop and I wish him well. He contributing amazing things in the world, but unless he's tracking carotid and coronary and doing it year after year after year, you know, it's an experiment. You might not Want to run, run those tests. Baseline baseline some nutrient deficiencies also take many years to consider. There's another guy that I follow online. I'm sorry, I forget the gentleman's name, but he advocates organ meat and he's saying that organ meat, if you just eating steak that you've got an issue, but if you take into count liver

Speaker 3:          03:24:44       and heart kidneys that you are going to get all these essential nutrients from that you're still not getting vitamin c that I'm aware of an insignificant amount. You're not getting cArotinoids and flavonoids and people not getting smaller phenol. We don't know. We don't know. yeah, so yeah, we don't know. Is a good summation of of is it possible that there's some mechanism that's going on that picture he was eating steak and cheese, so it's apparently not an all meat diet and I'm not slamming them. I really wish him well and he can do what he wants. I don't know. Very nice guy. Yeah. Yeah. just detail is important though because the organ meats and then like fattier cuts of meat, have glycine and other nutrients that are really important. If you're only eating lean meat, I think yeah, I would be very concerned about that.

Speaker 3:          03:25:32       Children do not try this at home. Someone tried to get me there were saying you should try a carnivore diet for 90 days, and I said, well, the real problem with that be I game and that's extremely smart and I like vegetables. I love vegetables. I like to eat them. I eat vegetables with essentially every single meal. That's very smart because I told you it's an antidote if nothing else. I mean it's. I do think that it's entirely possible that maybe it's people that have this disrupted gut microbiome, but that some people might be alert. One of the things that mckayla peterson brought up when she was on the podcast that it might very well be that she's allergic to almost everything. She has some sort of an allergic reaction. You, I think you both think that that could be because of a fucked up.

Speaker 3:          03:26:18       Got my maps. It's absolutely. She just hasn't had evaluated. She, she started to laugh when I talked to my naturopath. That's what you should have kept on doing. Gotten her gut analyte and gotten her gut healed. I mean maybe that would've helped her, you know, kind of problem with those natural path. It's like good psychics and can I try to find one? I'll tell you that it's also not. Look, not all problems are solvable, right? That's we, that's a really hard thing to accept. But let's say you get in a car accident and your spine is crushed, you know, most in short of a miracle, you know, that's not, that person's not going to read fully regained their 100 percent of their musculoskeletal capabilities. Right? But we don't have that same understanding with other conditions, health conditions. Let's say I go to Indonesia and I get 10 parasites and you know, and, and, and then I'd have to take tons of antibiotics to deal with that. Is my gut ever going to return to 100 percent of the function that it, that it had before that even with all the right things, maybe not. And so I'm not saying that the people should give up hope and I'm saying that like we have to separate between this is helping me and it's making me feel great and nothing else worked. and we know with 100 percent certainty that this is safe for the long term. Those are two very questions

Speaker 5:          03:27:42       and again, I'm totally empathetic to that and I would probably do the same thing, situate yourself that has gone through this process of being extremely unhealthy and I might even say, hey, you know, if I, maybe I'll die five years earlier, but I'll enjoy the, you know, those years of my life, I won't be in pain and discomfort the entire time then sign me up or I might, I might say to myself, well wait, it can't be that good for me to be inflamed all the time and like, you know, that can't be good for me, so maybe even though the, the all meat diet might have some downsides and it actually might be reducing inflammation and therefore that will cancel out. We just don't know. What about all meat diet? The thing that gets me is there's no vitamin supplementation. I'm like, what about an all meat diet with good supplementation of multivitamin and pretty smart idea.

Speaker 5:          03:28:29       It was fiber omega three coming fine. It's being questioned. I mean it is. It as centraL to health in the medical literature, Dr. Dennis burkitt from england went to africa. Describe fiber described it, reduced all kinds of chronic diseases that you wrote, a book called the fiber man and all. It's being questioned now. It's so entrenched. Have we got it all wrong and only plants of fiber. It's a good question. Where are they getting their fiber? Their meat is sticking in their colon. It's called putrefaction for days and days. That's is it? Yeah. Well it's. That is what happens and they. Jaime died at 100 percent with every single person. When you chew it well and drink water, does it always get stuck? It's generally thought that it's fiber. That is the process of moving abdominal contents, whether you eat a, a, an all plant diet or. No, I mean I think there's still, there's definitely controversy about fiber, but I think the weight of the evidence still still does suggested fermentable carbohydrates.

Speaker 5:          03:29:28       Fiber essentially beneficial because the very important for the microbiome and we have, you know, people like justin sonnenburg at stanford who's done a lot of good work here. Um, do we know with a hundred perCent certainty? No, but we also know that virtually every human population that's ever been studied had significant amounts of fiber in their diet, so, so if we're going with die, right? No, they, they did a very high note, the warriors, they consumed the warriors consumed milk and meat and blood at certain times of year when they were, you know, and, and other times of year they did eat more plant foods, so the white, the white plants, but in the, even the nun, the traditional knew it, you know, they had a d during certain times a year, like the winter when the ground was covered with snow. They had a very low intake of plant foods, but they would still trade for them and then during the summer when, when they were able to collect berries and things like that, they would definitely do that. So every culture that we know of that's been studied, eight, some combination of animal and plant foods, you know, what ratio, what amount, you know, that varies place to place

Speaker 4:          03:30:40       depending on where they are. Um, but that's, that's what the anthropological data show. There's actually, you know, when you talk about this too, super, super cool piece of data. I'll go quick, there's a professor at university of pittsburgh, steven o'keefe, who took 20 african americans in pittsburgh eating and intercity not healthy diet and 20 rural africans in South Africa eating from the bush and largely plants and they switched them for 20 days and they measured every single thing they can measure in the microbiome, in their stool, metabolites, tmao and all the rest. Your body is so amazing that 20 days on a better diet, well, what I would call the rural african died a better diet. You know, there was incredible changes towards health, making butyric acid, having bacteroidetes and prepatella I mean changes and the the rural african suffered american illness in terms of what you can measure within two weeks now there's data I just learned yesterday in los angeles that I'm microbiome changes in five days.

Speaker 4:          03:31:34       You go to a low sugar, low protein plant diet. This is university of southern California. I can tell you in five days michela peterson's microbiome would change. Would she feel better? I don't know. I'm just pointing out just the remarkable resiliency and that's part of the issue. You can feed a human a whole lot of diets and make it through procreation, which is our main purpose of evolutionary biology to be here. We're talking about from procreation to death for optimal health, longevity, health span. there's more than one path. um, but let's not beat on our plant base, the people out there because we've shown you can reverse atherosclerosis. We've shown you can reverse prostate cancer, university of California south as a use csf and we've shown you can lengthen your telomeres, which may have implications for longevity. So it's done through ketogenic diet as well.

Speaker 4:          03:32:23       Doesn't that lengthen your telomeres? I don't think that's been published. It's a be an interesting project. You know, it takes about three to six months, so you'd have nobody. No, it's not been looked at. And they say the same thing about a diet that is rich in a, you know, vegetables and fruits and animal foods. You know, the, the benefits that you can reverse heart disease with what you just said. Don't touch that. You cannot reverse atherosclerosis with animal products. It's never been studied. The only thing. so then how can you say you cannot do it? Why do we have studies? What would you tell a patient with the 99 percent blockages that come to me? Go eat meat. That's. We have studies that show that switching from a standard american diet to a neutral for diet. Yeah. Um, this is a new word, neutraL for you coined this sarah ballantine. And this is the idea is just plant based meat. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, it's a whole foods diet with fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. Some starchy plants and animal foods. Why don't you call that paleo? Now? The problem with paleo, paleolithic people didn't really eat like that. They had a lot of grains. So when

Speaker 5:          03:33:38       I don't think that's for me, for me, neutral four is a more inclusive term. That just means that what I said, it doesn't necessarily some, some neutral voice might include some dairy products. They might include some grains or lagoons, um, but what they're eating whole real foods and they're including animal foods there to distinguish that from vegan or vegetarian isn't the criticism of the paleolithic diet or calling it the paleolithic diet. The people in the paleolithic era actually did experience at least some form of agriculture people. There has been recent data that suggests that a green consumption in lagoon consumption went back further than it was originally thought it was. Now, whether those were prominent parts of the diet or fall back foods is another question. And does that even matter? I mean, this is why I've argued that the evolutionary perspective is important. it's just a way of generating hypotheses, kind of like observational research. It's not an. you can't look at what our ancestors ate and say that therefore that's what we should eat right now. You can look at it and say, oh, that's interesting. Let's test this out. Joel, how does it reverse

Speaker 4:          03:34:50       disease? Okay. Ketogenic diet and tila mirrors. There's no sane studies out there. Just to follow up to know, um, how does it reverse heart disease? You go back to los angeles, California in 1948, Dr. Lester morrison, internist. It's real answer. Saw that in the country of Norway in world war two where they dropped their animal food consumption because of the nazis. Heart disease slowed for those two, three years. He said, I wonder what happens with my heart patients in los angeles, he had 100 of them. There was no treatment. in 1948, he put half of them on a low animal diet with very high plants that half of them make like los angeles people. Eight years later, 50 percent on the high plant lowfat diet. We're alive. Zero percent on the standard. Los angeles died and then a series of people said, let's start doing that more routinely. Ultimately there were randomized clinical studies using cath lab techniques using ultrasound techniques using pet scanning.

Speaker 4:          03:35:43       This shows it actually causes small decreases in the amount of plaque in your heart arteries, which results in tripling of blood flow because it's it's fluid physiology that is four r squared, so small decreases in plaque. Nobody ever thought you could decrease plaque with diet and lifestyle, but you can cause this big increase in flow. So within three, four weeks, chest pain goes away. Within three, four months, stressed us, get better, and as you keep going, a number of hospitalizations procedures go down dramatically to the point. Initially small studies got big enough. In 2010 medicare said, we'll pay for patients to learn how to do this reversal lifestyle. They don't pay for mediterranean diet, they don't pay for dash diet, they don't pay for paleo, keto, neutral for. They pay for plant based diets for advantage

Speaker 5:          03:36:26       only because the these concepts of neutral bar and paleo have not been around for very long. So all you said

Speaker 4:          03:36:33       the study, okay, you don't

Speaker 5:          03:36:35       have the millions of dollars to do this study but don't. Don't be rigorous. So all all that you have said, which I agree with, is that a plant, a vegan or plant based kind of diet compared to a standard american diet will reverse some markers of atherosclerosis. Tip number one, the. I agree with that statement, but there's no. We don't have research. It's not like studies have been done taking people from standard american to neutral for paleo and we haven't seen benefits. We have rcts that have shown significant benefits in cardiovascular markers, markers neutral for diets and paleo and low carb for that matter, and key to genic. Your assumption is that the real issues of standard american diet is killing people and lack of that lack of evidence is not evidence against it, so we don't. We don't know that. How long have. How long have these concepts been around neutral for paleo?

Speaker 5:          03:37:36       How many studies have been done looking, comparing, for example, let's do it would be great if we had a study where you had standard american diet, then you had two different groups you had or a control group of standard american diet and then you had you know, vegan diet and then you had neutral for paleo. We don't have that study, so we can't say that that eating a diet that's rich in whole foods but contained some animal foods isn't going to reverse atherosclerosis. We can't say that. So I think one thing that we can absolutely agree on is that the standard american diet socks and that a vegan diet is superior to the standard american diet. These, these two men, these two things are if the vegan implementing wisely, wisely. I just tell you, and this is very subtle, but vegan diets as which you can't do.

Speaker 5:          03:38:21       You can't eat dairy and eggs, you can't eat fish can eat whole food. Plant based is really the proper medical term. What do you eat? Eat john. Joseph talks about too, he calls it call with a whole food plant based because you, you know, you don't want to be just eating pasta all day. Oh absolutely. No food vegetarian or junk food vegan diet. So the dispute is whether or not animal protein in organ meats will advance your health and, and, and make in debt. It's a superior diet when you add that one quarter of your plate. So yeah, I'm. One of the ways to answer this is to look at nutrient density. So I have this study on my websites, my yo, I think my low and my french is terrible. M a I l l o, t and m, uh, it's uh, [inaudible] dot com slash rogan, um, and he looked at nutrient density of foods and categorize them based on nutrient density and he was only looking at, he was looking at essential nutrients, so all the vitamins and minerals that we absolutely need for health. He wasn't looking at polyphenols and flavonoids and things like that, which are beneficial, but we don't absolutely need. So the number one food in terms of nutrient density, do you want to guess what organ meats organized score of seven. Fifty four. Next highest shellfish. Six 43. And I've often said this to my patients like kale, you can be a vegetarian or an only eat organ, meats and shellfish, you'd be doing really well because of just how nutrient dense they are.

Speaker 4:          03:39:52       And that's not really a controversial.

Speaker 5:          03:39:54       Let me come here. Fatty fish, six slash 22. Lean fish is three 75. Um, and then vegetables or 3:52 so that, you know, vegetables are on there, but a organ, meat, shellfish, fatty fish, lean fish, um, are all higher than, than vegetables and grains and lagoons don't even really make the, you know, they're nowhere close in terms of nutrient density. I think we can all agree that, uh, when someone goes from the standard american diet to a vegan diet, there's a real reason why they're experiencing significant health benefits, particularly if they supplement. YeAh, yeah, that's right. That's true. Are highly processed and refined, assuming they're eating a whole foods vegan diet and not just subsisting on begets and cookies and stuff like that, which unfortunately people do. We'll do just like people eat the standard american diet and you know, for that matter, just like people who go paleo and, and, and are eating paleo donuts and paleo ice cream, whatever, you know, like you can do it on any dietary approach. No foods.

Speaker 4:          03:41:01       It was going to say, you know, I never have proposed except for one small subset that everybody needs to eat a completely plant based diet. But if they do, they're probably going to have good health. There's a concept called the spectrum. Dr. Dean ornish, some people beat up on, but he's done all these studies on reversal of atherosclerosis and he celebrated around the world. Has a book called the spectrum. Go as far towards it as you can. I'll love you wherever you're at, you choose. We're not judging you. And that's I think the message for your listeners. I mean it what you're eating vegetables or fruit or maybe it's just vegetables. Every meal. That's the example people need to hear and they don't need to abandon everything else. Just don't do it with a donut. Don't do it with a bagel. Don't do these calorie empty. And also time restricted eating. I think we all agree on the awesome. Twelve hours, 14 hours a day. I'm a big fan of four or five days a month, lowering calories with low protein, low sugar, and now the science is coming out. Unbelievable. It's right here from los angeles.

Speaker 5:          03:41:51       No, I mean, so I want to say that we're talking about helping people and I was a vegan at one point and a vegetarian and I have friends that are vegans and vegetarians. Again, I'm not ideological about this at all. And um, so I want to say like, so someone who is a vegetarian or vegan and just to show how nutrient dense organ meats and shellfish are, if you want it to be a vegan but you're not, you know, ideologically opposed to eating some small amount of animal product or animal food, you could eat one clam oyster and four grams, which is a tiny amount of liver a day and you would completely meet your needs for b12, zinc, copper, coleen,

Speaker 2:          03:42:32       and many other nutrients with no other consumption of animal foods beyond that. So this is what I said before, like the spectrum is large, you know, some people might consume a much, a higher percentage of animal foods. Some people could consume just that much and they would still improve their health and wellbeing by doing that from then eating a strictly a plant diet.

Speaker 1:          03:42:56       And, uh, one thing that I do have to tell you, joel, unfortunately, is that you keep saying that nick and nate diaz or vegan,

Speaker 2:          03:43:04       I know they, they've fallen back. I don't keep saying it, but they've fallen back. Well, you brought it up a bunch of times, but he was. When he, when he won the fight, he was, he was eating fish, fish and eggs. That's cool. I worry about this tape, male level, but it's cool. No, I'm serious. But you know, the explosion, the Tennessee titans and kyrie irving and serena williams. I mean serena williams is vegan as well. Yeah. She reversed and auto immune disease called sjogren's. Yeah. So is it isn't necessary to be plant based to be a world class athlete? Obviously not. Is it compatible to be. Do you know who patrick bamyan holds a world record for power lifting? He's been plant based his whole life. Big, stocky litho guy up. Patrick, pat, pat, r I k, I mean it's this big stocky german, but he lives 1200 pounds and he has the world record.

Speaker 2:          03:43:48       He hasn't eaten some meat. None. Nick delgado a nema delgado. Nick, the point is it's an option to be a super athlete without animal products. We're seeing it more and more recovery. Which troll on your thing, but you know it happens. Just stop beating on us because we're doing pretty well, but yeah, fds has gone back to eating fish and vegetables. It's a whole lot better than the crap american diet that a lot of athletes say. They just cut out all the land animals. Yeah. You initially started doing it to make. Wait, okay. Yeah, I got it. Got it, got it. A lot of people are talking about quicker recovery that. I mean there's some like alex and sarah sees the world

Speaker 1:          03:44:29       class fighter. He's. He's completely vegan. Sean o'malley was for awhile, but he found himself to have much more energy when he started eating meat, but he might've been. He might've been doing it wrong or not.

Speaker 2:          03:44:41       My biome and supplementation. Yeah, believe it, you know, but that's really cool. This, I forget her name right now, the chef that cooked for 15 Tennessee titans and you know, they're just kicking ass and griff wailin used to be with the miami dolphins. I forget where he is now, oakland raiders, you know, a great, great tight end and such. I mean, it's possible that we can say scott jurek set the world record for the appalachian trail faster than either the person eat beans. I mean, insane. A level of athletic fitness. The appalachian trail. yeah. It's like 24, 100, 2,400 miles fast as human to ever accomplish it on beans. I mean, pretty cool. I mean, this was such an amazing thing to watch a documentary. Yeah. Should we wrap this up? Yeah. Wow. We obviously we've left

Speaker 1:          03:45:24       flat on the table. It was still alive. We did, that's disputed. But uh, I think one thing that we came to a really solid conclusion, not as a standard american diet sucks and any deviation from it, that's a whole food based diet and especially with proper nutrients that are supplemented if you're vegan or what have you, is going to be better than standard american diet. The dispute is whether or not the nutrient dense organ meats, shellfish, meat, fish, and these things would eggs. That these would benefit you significantly. And I think that's how we got through it, like very peacefully, just just

Speaker 2:          03:46:03       eat real food, real food. I actually refer people in san francisco to chris. I honor what he's doing. I mean we may have this dispute about saturated fat and cholesterol and it's not unimportant, but he is a prime practitioner. He's treating people at the right level. I believe I'm doing that in detroit. And the people that come to see me, you know, where the solution. We're not the problem despite the differences. And you're a good man to bring us on, you know, point all that out.

Speaker 1:          03:46:24       both handled yourself admirably. I mean this is, this is a very emotional, tightly contested sort of a dispute. And I, I thank you both very much for being here.

Speaker 2:          03:46:34       Well thanks for the opportunity to joe. I mean the have the chance to do this for what almost four hours now. That's amazing. And it serves people because on most tv segments it's like five minutes and you just get the headlines and there's no depth. So you get these click bait articles and it's confusing. So thanks for giving us the chance to really dive deeply on it. Anybody that wants more, download chris's references. Go to my website, the rogan references, you know, read more study time. Um, yeah, dr joel kahn.com. Big red button rogan references. You can keep yourself busy for tWitter, which is on my page. But as had dr j k a h n dr j dot scott and chris. Uh, chris kresser.com/rogan for all the research here. E s s e r slash rogen and tHen chris kresser twitter. all right, beautiful. Thank yOu guys. It was really fun.
