I need to speak to humans. There's a disconnect. Yeah, right. I hear target just got hacked. Really heard it on the news that said like if you've ever shopped at target or online, no, you're fucked. You're going to credit card. That is everybody we need is everybody just everything's going through computers. It's just numbers and fucking data. It's nice to talk to a person every now and then, especially if they live in America.

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       It's really disconcerting. It feels strange. Not there's anything wrong with talking to people from India and most certainly is nothing wrong with talking to people from India, but when you're on the phone with someone, you know they're not even in America. It's a head trip. It's like what Dell? What did you do? Why? Whatever companies do it. Like what? What are you doing? Why is he these people on the other side of the world in a sweat factory phone answering. It makes you feel like the company doesn't care about any of us. At the end it feels like you're being put off, but you gotta think like how many knucklehead fucking phone calls if you are running a computer company, say if you're selling windows computers and you've got a customer service line, just stop and think about the fucking numb skull questions your friends have asked you about their computers.

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       Like you know that one friend that didn't get a laptop until he was 30. Alright, alright. I'm getting in and starts asking questions. She had something wrong with my video drive. Like, oh, there's something wrong with your video drive. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. How fucking what? Where were you living when you live in it? You didn't understand the computer. What's cut and paste? What am I supposed to do that with gateway? Man, it was the worst. Yeah, you did that. So what I'm, what I was thinking is that that job is, you know, that's like nobody wants that. That's the reason why they pawn it off after a. they'd probably fuck it. We can, we can't do this. This is ridiculous. We can't really give advice. He gives good advice. These motherfuckers will never get off the phone, they can't figure out anything.

Speaker 1:          00:05:27       They don't know too much. I got to come to your house. I'm going to sit down with you for hours on end. You have to be interested in learning. Yeah, that's the tough part. If you're starting from scratch now, you know, fucking too much, man. We've adapted all of our skills and searching, clicking and pasting and control, seeing and control all the leading and we, we've, we've, we've been fucking hitting keyboards for so long when someone's never done it and they're like looking for the why and like, oh, I'll come back tomorrow. There's a new pop

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       machines that they have where you can choose all the different flavors. Like coke, coke, orange. I was behind an old couple of last night at Boston market and it took them like 10 minutes. Just a poor cocacola. Well there used to places where they actually are the options.

Speaker 1:          00:06:15       They're from a generation where they ordered a coke and then someone brought it to them. Well, you didn't have to work at the restaurant

Speaker 3:          00:06:20       as well. Made the coke at the place.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       We'll just get through these sponsors real quick. Um, we're also brought to you by ting. If you go to [inaudible] dot ting.com, if you never heard of ting. Ting is, uh, one of our favorite sponsors because it's the only one that we have other than squarespace. And I think I've never heard anybody say a single negative thing about it. Everybody who's used it loves it. Guys that are on the podcast regularly, like Chris Ryan, he used it, says it saved them money. They say that 98 percent of people would save money with Ting and that's what it says on their website because they do mobile differently and what they mean by that is that, first of all, they don't have contracts. You don't have to be connected with them in a way that it makes it really uncomfortable to get out of it. What they have is real straightforward, no nonsense cellular service.

Speaker 1:          00:07:09       It's available on the sprint network. They buy time on the sprint backbone. So you're dealing with a really high end cell phone signal. You're dealing with four G, you're dealing with the top Nokia devices that top Samsung devices, all the bad ass android devices on the big screen. Once that's what they sell and you can bring them over from, um, from a sprint as well. Uh, if you, if you have phones for sprints, particularly even iphones for the forecast, you can bring them over from sprint. What, what they're trying to do is give you a no bullshit cell phone service where they don't have to rip you off. They charge you a decent rate for an excellent service and everybody's happy. It's just an ethical way to do business. It's a, it's an interesting approach and we've had nothing but positive feedback from the people that have used it. I don't know, Brian saved $100 or something when he was in. What was it?

Speaker 3:          00:08:06       I save $100 every month using my team, my, my bill last month and I've been since I got this galaxy note three, I've been using it like crazy. And My bill last month was 27 bucks. You can buy six dozen roses with the fucking sell it. Sell it, flipped them roses. Yeah. Thing. It's confusing. Ting

Speaker 1:          00:08:32       has the phone that I'm using right now, which was the Samsung Galaxy note three. It's fucking amazing. I'm so into this phone. I've never had a better phone for doing everything that. Yeah, it's just so big that it just makes me, uh, makes me like, look like iphones will play toys now. It's such a rich experience. Like, you know, like if you go to a website, you almost get a real website. It's like you're moving it

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       around. Shit fits in my back pocket. Tim has that. They also have the galaxy s four, which is a, another really pretty dope, a Samsung phone. They have all the best of the um, what is off the sprint network? All the best phones that uh, you could get like, um, it was the nexus to. What was it? There's a bunch of nexuses galaxy mega black also. They have to admit that that megaphone, which is even bigger than it note, or they have that crazy thing. Yeah, they have, I think it's bigger. I, you know what else I have? I have that htc one that is also another excellent phone. That phone is beautiful too. Like the build quality. It's all aluminum. It's pretty sleek. That's that one on the far right. That's bad ass. Nice. That's probably the right side. I always say that people like, my phone's probably too big like three months from now, but like what am I doing? This big fucking stupid thing on my ipad. I'm starting to not like this flap as much. Like the slabs. Annoying. Yeah. Because I don't like the book. I think I'm going to go back to a regular case. Yeah, me too. Because it seems like you have to hold it weird. It doesn't feel like it can grip it or what do you got? You've got a mirror in the. In the flap.

Speaker 4:          00:10:01       Dan. Handsome. I keep. Keep my powder. Open it up. Imagine there's like a little lip balm. Their little thing you unscrew. Um, at first I thought it was really cool and now it's annoying. Yeah, it just doesn't feel good on the hand. It's, well, it's goofy for. You're trying to. If you're trying to do anything with one hand, I feel like you have to spin it around and hold it in place and I guess it's not that bad. Not too bad. Maybe I'll miss it when it's gone, but for now get all depressed. Go to Rogan.ting.com. And you can save 25 bucks off of any of their new phones that they sell. And as we said, they're all the top of the line. Android phones, the ones that uh, I'm actually using right now. So we'll go there. Get yourself some fucking roses. I wouldn't give it that nice one and read that one that you have been in red.

Speaker 4:          00:10:49       Oh, the htc one is awesome phone. I'm Brogan Dot Ting.com. Go there. My friends go fly. Be Free and enjoy cheap cell phone service from an excellent provider. Uh, I shouldn't say cheap. Inexpensive people. Don't like cheap. An expensive. Learn that Phil charge. This is called advertising lingo. I'm trying to school you sign. It's a bargain. It ain't cheap. It's a fucking bargain. We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com on it is o n n I t, and if you've paid attention to, uh, some of the more recent things about vitamins a, there's a, a fascinating blog that aubrey put up over it on it. Vitamins. There's all this debate about whether or not these new studies showed vitamins to be, uh, to be dangerous or have to be ineffective. And the study is actually a really pretty limited. I was kind of shocked that they would make the conclusions from this study that they made because what the study showed was first of all, people who had already had heart disease

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       and these are very minimal doses of synthetic vitamins too. And they showed people with a heart heart that had already had heart attacks, like recovery from heart attacks. People showing a cognitive decline. And I forget there was one other one, but the idea behind it was that they were showing that vitamins we're just not effective. And that because in these three cases that they're stating that they didn't show in a positive impact using what are essentially synthetic vitamins. The best way to get vitamins for sure is from food, but if you want to get high level nutrients like really high levels in your body to the point where it's affecting you in positive ways, like with a nootropic or with a vitamin B, 12, when you're exercising to actually get that all from food. Holy Fuck Shit. A lot of weird shit. A lot of planning. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:50       This. The idea that these vitamins don't work is silly. There's a reason why everyone knows by vitamin 12 gives you energy. It's because it's universally accepted. If you take a shot of vitamin B 12, if they give it to you inter muscularly, it has an impact on your energy. There's no doubt about it. When you work out, you feel like you have more, more energy, more Gusto. You have more vibrance to it. Fucking make it mean. That's a pretty important discovery that a vitamin gives your body more energy to push hard, but it does. It really does work like B. Twelve is about as rock. Solid science is against. These are the reason why these things have all been isolated, like they know what the effects of these things are and there's a gang of studies that showed a different improvements and people that had taken vitamins for infectious illness, for mood and stress, cognition, work, stress.

Speaker 1:          00:13:42       They even did a study on juvenile delinquency and they showed an improvement in juvenile delinquency. Yeah, and the lack of it. If you give the kids healthy vitamins, well, I read something in that that most of the people that commit suicide are vitamin deficient and I don't know if vitamins can help you with that, but while it says something right there, I mean it makes you really unhappy if you don't have all your vitamins. There's no doubt. I think a lot of people with the average American diet are vitamin deficient and it's way better, way better to get your diet in order and then slept. It's way better, but I don't think there's ever any wrong reason to supplement as long as you're getting good vitamins and nutrients and that's where it gets weird because all vitamins are not created equal. So when he makes like an irresponsible statement where you like case closed, vitamins don't work, that's really silly because you're your actual studies.

Speaker 1:          00:14:32       They didn't prove that at all. In fact, it does work. There's a reason why they know that, that scurvy is cured by vitamin C. it's a vitamin C deficiency. We have isolated all of these compounds that are crucial to human health. They know what the fuck they are. Doesn't. If the FDA loved to say vitamins don't work, I don't know who's saying it. I think it's just these doctors that are, uh, that, that put together a case, um, with these, uh, multivitamin researchers. But it's, look, they've got us talking about it, you know, it's, it's certainly something to be discussed because I think they're right writing a lot of ways and what they're right in a lot of ways is that if you take like a standard multivitamin and you don't know the source of it, you don't know if it's food base. You don't know if it's plant based, you don't know where they are. Extracting their nutrients from you, you're very likely to get.

Speaker 1:          00:15:23       Doesn't absorb. Right? Yeah. Well, it it most certainly doesn't absorb as well as the food, but you're, you're. You don't know what levels you're getting. Like you don't know. You don't know where, where they're extracting it from, how much bile availability is in these vitamins. All vitamins are not created equally and the way you break them down is not created equal either. Like those, those one a day things will have blue tablets. They famously find those fucking things in the bottom of those Porta potties and people shut them out and they see this little blue bullets. I've read it online, so it must be true. I've done no research, no research port-a-potty research on my own. That might be a snitch thing is, is that what these people are saying? Are there or are they saying that normal multivitamin, you don't absorb any enough to do anything? Is that what they're claiming they're claiming is that they've shown that vitamins? Well, they're basically saying that vitamins are not worth your time, that vitamins, the vitamins don't work enough is enough. Stop wasting your money on vitamin and mineral supplements is the actual title of the piece. They found that most people that use Porta potties have diarrhea. Well that that's crazy. It's say it's out of there quick little raft ride. You also don't use it unless it's an emergency. It's like a log roll down a raft.

Speaker 1:          00:16:38       Everything out, everything out of raging river. I take [inaudible] every morning under my tongue and I immediately feel it will be 12 is also proven effective. It's a joke to say the vitamins and minerals don't do anything for your body as a silly statement, so when you see this enough is enough. Stop wasting money on vitamin and mineral supplements and then you look at their actual findings. The findings were like there was a very limited test done on a. They were male physicians over 65 showed no improvement in cognitive decline using generic multivitamins supplementation. Okay? That's one. It's male physicians over age 65. Okay, alright. They still went nutty. They had a cognitive decline. Okay, and they showed no improvement in cognitive decline using generic multivitamins. Supplements. So fucking what? That doesn't mean anything like generic multivitamins, supplements, and you're talking about guys who are over age 65 that are already sliding into the abyss.

Speaker 1:          00:17:43       You saying vitamins didn't haul them from what nature? Vitamins didn't hold them from the old process because that's what you're talking about here. So that's one part of this study. Another study showed that high dose multivitamins had no effect on the progression of heart disease and heart attacks of virus. Okay? Now you're talking about people who had fucking heart attack and then you give them multivitamins and you're. You're saying that vitamins didn't hell, how the fuck do you know that it didn't have an effect on progression of heart disease? How the fuck do you know that they wouldn't have already gotten even quicker, a relapse of a heart attack if they weren't taking vitamins like the person's dying already had a heart attack. If you have one heart attack, you're. You're very likely to have another. So saying that multivitamins don't work because it didn't stop that.

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       This is crazy talk. You're talking about people that are already dying. It just seems very irresponsible. It's very irresponsible. It's irresponsible and very suspect. It doesn't make any sense and I should point out that it on it. We don't sell multivitamins, we don't sell any of that shit. We sell only food based stuff because the closer it is to food, the easier it is for your body to digest it. It's just really simple stuff. With synthetic stuff can work, but it doesn't work as good for your body. Like it's not as bioavailable as what you can extract from food and that's why when we sell vitamins we try to sell like like supplements. If it's green stuff, it's like spirulina and chlorella. That's how you say it. I don't know one ever say it. I just read it and then green supplements. There's way better to get it in food though.

Speaker 1:          00:19:17       And what is this? Just like dehydrated food or what? Well, I don't know how they extracted the extract is probably probably says it on the website somewhere, but it's essentially they're extracting nutrients from from Greens and grass and things along those lines and you just mix this shit in water and you get a better nutritional response than just a cheeseburger. And fries that ain't doing anything. It's. It'll be better for you than a lot of things. It's just a supplement and having supplements, it allows us in our busy everyday life too. You know, you can, you can, you can boost your body's performance, you can give yourself a little bit of an edge and a lot of different areas. Whether it's workouts to taking something like shroom tech sport which is based out of the quarter steps mushroom. It's been proven that the quarter mushroom has a really positive effect on your body's ability to process oxygen.

Speaker 1:          00:20:11       And it's really interesting stuff because they first learned about it from high altitude hurting populations and apparently what had happened was their cows would eat these mushrooms is quarter eps mushrooms and they, they became more active and they were noticing that they're more mobile. Well, they're living, they're more active than moving around more and they, they pieced it together and figured out that this is a mushroom that they were eating and when they were eating this mushroom, that's when they started having this response. So that also is mixed with a very bioavailable form of vitamin B 12 and it's an awesome supplement to take about an hour before you work out all these things work and we're so confident that they work that we have a 90 day 30 pill moneyback guarantee when you buy new mood, which is a five htp supplement, um, which is designed to give your body the building blocks for Serotonin, give your body the building blocks to make your brain actually feel better when all this stuff is fascinating stuff. And there's a lot of science behind five htp as well, and all the other different supplements. It's all listed on it. Go to o, n n I t this commercials too long and entering the code name, Rogan and save yourself 10 percent off any and all supplements. All right, boom. The full charges here, gentlemen, let's get freaky. Yes. Keith.dot podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       The full chart. By the way, I have spoken to the actual Nick Diaz himself, the man in the train by day video. Yeah. And he, he's going to do the podcast, allegedly nick. He's, he's a, he's a free spirit. He might change his mind. Right, right, right. Like you're free. You're free spirit. A Duncan trussell budding. Yeah. Well, no. Well, Duncan had a very legitimate reason. One hundred percent legitimate reason that he couldn't podcast today. That's all good. No, no, no, no, but it's a personal reason and he'll be on Tuesday. People used to mistake us for one another back in the day because I never have, you know, what is it? The glasses? I think it was the nose and we both got big teeth. When I saw him, I'm like, that's my brother from another mother. Really? I mean, you get older, you start to look different.

Speaker 1:          00:22:26       It's not the same thing anymore, but when I met him when we were both younger and someone has called me a Duncan trussell looking motherfucker. That's a quote. That was the guy that knew you were a comic. Yeah, this was fat jams. I don't know if you knew that Jay course. I knew James. I was very sad when he passed. I miss that guy. He was a sweetheart. Yeah. Fat James for the comedy store and he called himself Pat James Folks. Sure. He put his hand out and say, fat James. Hi James. Pleased to meet you. He would literally call himself James. He was a fun guy to be around. That was his hook. I'm fat. Fat. James's story was he came home one night. He was fit. I guess he was in the military, right? Wasn't he in the military? I didn't know him that well.

Speaker 1:          00:23:10       He wasn't he in the military? Do you know Brian? I don't remember that part. Was either a cop or he's in the military. One of those. Anyway, he was fit. He was like healthy guy. He came home and caught his wife and his best friend. Okay. And just went off the deep end. Just started eating, Huh? Yeah. That was a story. Be In beautiful. Didn't work for them. I mean, you know, his wife cheated on him. Well, I don't know if it was ever beautiful. I don't know. How beautiful did. What was potential for beauty is. Yeah. Good guy though, man. He was a really good guy. He's a fun guy. Always around store. He still. What did he do back there? He worked for the door to door for awhile. He had that east coast flavor. I'll tell you what, the dude. He was fucking funny on stage too. Yeah. I saw fat james have some funny sets. He was ridiculous. Did a couple stints

Speaker 4:          00:23:57       on a always sunny in Philadelphia. Diddy. Absolutely, dude. He had some. He of get some acting work after awhile. You hear? Is this him trying to get on this? They're trying to put him up on a mechanical bull. Oh my God. Great Hair. He's so big. One flip and he's down. Remember him taking a shower? He plopped. This is. Oh God. Oh, that's so hilarious. Oh, this is so funny. Jimmy and Joey. Wow. Check it out. I'm getting nostalgic, man. You know, I've actually been Jimmy and the Jimmy and joey were phenomenal. Just once, just on a whim. The Jimmy and Joey. What for those that don't know Jimmy and joey is like a. it's like a double andrew dice clay. Do you know like brothers version of edge, like Jimmy and Joey, don't you? From the back and forth. It's like, oh, come on. Italians don't like Jehovah's Witnesses. I don't know what job is. Windows. Oh, tell us don't like any witnesses and they just go back and forth with the setup and then the punchline. I remember those guys. So there was always different Jimmy's fat Jameson. And at one point I was a Jimmy James was the Jimmy. Oh, I get what you're saying. So you played during the show. So

Speaker 1:          00:25:32       I just did it once. Oh, that's funny. So they use like, they have fake names. Well yeah, there's the will. The original Jimmy was really named Jimmy. That's fascinating subject because I know that guys have sold their acts to other people. Like do you remember that guy who had defending the caveman? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Broadway thing. Yeah. What was that guy's name? I don't know his name because he was a standup and really a fascinating story because uh, he made a ton of money. Yes he did. He did. Um, he was a standup and he put together like he put a stand up together in the form of like a one man show and it became very popular. Uh, Rob Becker is his name, but then he started like selling it to people that they could do it, like actors, so they could all do it all at once. All over the country. Yeah. Michael Chiklis did it. No kidding. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No kidding. I'm almost positive. Hold on. Let me pull this up real soon because they're definitely doing that show in Vegas every time I'm there. By the way. Michael Chiklis, if you read it, I'm a huge fan. He's the shield, right? Yeah. I love that. The commish yeah. I'm not goofing on. Your men did one episode of Seinfeld. Are we talking about the same guy? Yeah, Michael Chiklis. He was also a the thing in the fantastic four.

Speaker 1:          00:26:49       Oh yeah, he did. Yeah, he did his Broadway debut in the one man show defending the caveman. So I was correct. We don't even need the internet. I just sort of remember it because I was like, wow, that's weird. But I guess I guess it makes sense, but to a comic, it's weird. Like, you know, like you were going to buy an act like all of a sudden, like he like few. For instance, let's say when you. What year did you start out? A 98. 90 eight. What if instead of you doing your act, what if Dave attell just sold you his act? Oh, I would love it. And you would go on stage and you would do like say like a classic albums. Thanks for the memories, which is my favorite hotel. If you went onstage and his and just did it as Dave attell and it would be. That would be called the skanks for the memory show. Right? And you would hire an actor to do it. That's weird. It's really weird. And God damn it. I wish that was available.

Speaker 1:          00:27:46       You want you to think though that like there are two totally different things is why it's weird. And when you, when you turn stand up into a one man show, then you can get away with anything because it's a clearly defined one man show and it's just defending the caveman one man show. Absolutely. As a comic you never do that? No. No, no, no, no, no, no, you can't do it because every year you have to have a new act. Right? So this what, what's going on? Is it that this guy figured out a way to take stand up but transport it into a safe zone. Right. And then just drop it off where it exists in perpetuity, right? No more rules. And now this can be done at the same time in all 50 states and you get you in a way. You get all the money from it so you don't have to tour as much.

Speaker 1:          00:28:32       You stay in Vegas and do it. Well, all your minions do it around the country. That is fucking weird. What if you started charging show, making the full charge show? Yeah. You were showing the full charge show. You would show it in Los Angeles and select markets. Then you would give people licenses to do it in Atlanta. First of all, all, all my minions will have to be called the half charge. But what do you do for a living? I'm a half charge. So you do the full charges jokes. Do you write your own jokes? I have a lot of my own stuff, but mostly today people want to hear the full charge, so that's what I do for now. It's just, you know, it's not my dream. I'm basically a cover band. Yeah. This is what pays the bills and then I do my own stuff at open mics around Atlantic city, but it is fascinating that in our art form, the pretentious title that you give to standup comedy that we all give it.

Speaker 1:          00:29:18       You're not allowed to do that, but in almost every other kind of music you people do that. Movies or music or any other kind of entertainment, right? Terentino's straight up. Yeah. Like copies other movies and it's known as an Oma. Right. But like with standup, it's very sacred to us because I think it's just because you don't get paid as much. That's probably exactly what it is. We're just fun. Where's my piece? We got our rules. Oh, we certainly. Because it's not. It's not documented. When we do our stuff, not necessarily will you. If you have to have. You not only have to have rules for other people, you have to have rules for yourself too. You have to. Everybody has to keep everybody honest because the idea of creativity and the idea of originality and unique thoughts and the origin of thoughts. It's pretty important to us because it's all we have.

Speaker 1:          00:30:10       All comic has essentially is what he's created in his own mind and then put to paper our keyboard and then transfers to the stage. That's all you have as a comic. That's all you have. You can jazz it up and dance with it and do all kinds of shit, but if you don't have the raw material, you don't have anything. Exactly. That's why for us that that honesty process is super important. I also think it's one of the cool things about what we do that we have so many comic friends that were constantly interacting with on a regular basis. It's always joey and Ari and Duncan and you and score and fucking Christ and all super cool, super honest, super above board people. Right, and so you know, don't even want to do something that's similar to somebody else. To have known desire and drop shit in a heartbeat.

Speaker 1:          00:30:59       When you find out that it's too close to something that. Exactly. Just go fuck it. It's over the last you want to hear someone's comparing you to someone else now also you get to hang with and joke around with the funniest dudes on the planet. Yeah, because we all trust each other to just fuck around. Like we all trust each other. Like, like Ari was. I forget what the subject was. We were joking around about something the other day and I'm like, dude, you got to do that onstage. And we started working on how he would do it onstage. Like what are you feel like this or like that. And when you do that, like that camaraderie. When you do that for each other, like you both have an idea or one of you has an idea and the other one tries to enhance it and help each other.

Speaker 1:          00:31:40       That boost boost a saw. Like I'll get off stage to grow, have a tagline for me after he said that, like maybe that you're calling so much easier to write for someone else sometimes because like there's no pressure on what you wrote and you just get to sit back and watch the other person do it. Then something pops into your head and you can just give it like you don't. I mean it's just all inspiration. Have you ever tried to write for someone specifically though for their staff? Sat down and tried to write for someone? No. I know a lot of guys have done that though. Like I know, um, uh, there was a lot of guys that were helping Chris, Chris rock when he was putting together one of his hbo specials and I think the Pollo might've been one of them. I believe Rich Vos, Louis ck definitely wrote for Chris Rock I think because it will also.

Speaker 1:          00:32:28       Chris was doing so many different things at the same time and probably doing movies and shit and I think he just liked to have all those minds to help him go over his stuff, which is, that's a ballsy move, you know, have all these bad motherfuckers. Right. Cool. Jokes for you. I know. And I'll also work with you creating the jokes so you get like the opinions of all these expert comedians. I mean that's a real ballsy move because a lot of comedians don't want to be judged on their performances, but when you're bringing in guys like, like Louis C, k to write for you, I mean you're going to get the real deal. You're going to get me. So we're going to be the most honest assessment ever of the material and like a bunch of masterminds like gearing together and putting together this perfect masterpiece comedy.

Speaker 1:          00:33:10       Do you personally think that's good though? I think that's. Yeah, I think that's weird. It's good. No, it's not what I do, but it's. I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I think Chris Rock has one of the greatest comedians of all time and if that's how he did it brilliantly and it's right there on the credits. Oh, 100 percent by such and such, such and such. I know Eddie Murphy did it on raw keenan. Ivory Wayans wrote on raw. Absolutely nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with it. What it's, you know, especially because of the way they did it, which is so above board. They let everybody know they were doing it. No one, no one hit that. And not only that, it's like what's wrong with bringing in writers? There's nothing wrong with it. It's not unethical. It's not uncreative. Just because you're creating with other people, it doesn't mean you're not still creating and actually be very inspiring.

Speaker 1:          00:33:55       Yes. You know, and uh, and it could get rid of a lot of doubt. Yeah. As far as like, they're like, this is what you're doing. That's good. This is, you can use this, blah, blah, blah. It's exciting to. Plagiarism is the problem. It's not going to operation cooperation and paid cooperation, which is essentially what writing is. Writing for content is great. It sounds like a great idea. I don't do it that way, but I would. I think it's really common. It's just really personal for me, so it's like when you're involving somebody else's idea of what they think she should sound like. To me that's just gross. You got a badge and Chris rock went up at the seller, did what he had and then the other guys contributed. That's what I'm imagining. I'm very sure of that and then spice things up or added or had an idea.

Speaker 1:          00:34:40       Maybe Chris could run it out. Just be this. Getting all of his jokes and his guys. He was getting a little juice, little here and there, little spark and you're getting it from like hungry guys who are really good. They're, you know, they're out there. He's like, he's not like, Hey Louis, c k, let's talk about your divorce in my. I hear what you're saying too though. What I agree with you in a lot of ways is that like it's very personal, but even though it's very personal, like sometimes another eye on what you're doing, they'll open you up to like, oh, I didn't even think of that. And then like, why? Oh, why was I doing it that way? Because if I didn't, if I didn't say that, it would like open up the whole back end of it. Like there's, there's a lot of times like some things that your friends can see that you don't say. I know a lot of comics that actually have writers and that to me always felt really weird because it seems like they're just actors or the boyfriends boyfriend to call a writer. What if felt like I came up with this black peoples and this Nigga I got this idea when

Speaker 4:          00:35:37       it started to get bigger and blacker a white guy starts doing the bigger and blacker tour and just does all the. Well, there was a guy doing that for Hicks man, which I thought was really weird. Yeah. There's a guy that was doing like Hicks as a one man show here are, you know, the guy was doing,

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       uh, Bill Hicks as a one man show. God impersonating Bill Hicks is a one man. Show me Google this. That's weird because Bill Hicks still isn't famous. Oh, I think he's pretty famous. Is Larry still around? Is he on a show or something? I know they want to craig gas to do a, a, um, a kinison vegas thing. Well, he does an incredible. Yes in impression. Um, I can't find it here anywhere. There was, there was a guy, I'm very positive that there was a guy who was trying to put together a one man show and he was just going to do bill Hicks like, like Mark Twain, sort of a thing. She could go up and do mark Twain today because Mark Twain has been dead for a long time.

Speaker 4:          00:36:41       Fucking people are happy to see you. No one's going to know what he really was like and be like, pitch. That is not how mark twain talks. We focused. This is terrible. This is fucking terrible. At the pipe down. You're holding the pipe or the left. He helped with the right.

Speaker 1:          00:36:56       Oh God. But a guy like Hicks, like, you know, I saw him in the flesh. He didn't die that long ago. When did you see him and where did you see him? I saw him a couple times. I saw him. I saw him at least at least three, possibly four occasions meeting. I saw him for an entire weekend. Okay. And uh, it was all when he was visiting Boston, he was a big, like touring pro coming off of the Rodney dangerfield special was like just starting to catch heat right as I got into comedy. So I was lucky enough to be at a point where the clubs of let me come by like an open mic or. But the clubs would let me in on a Friday night and I could watch God. There's no way I was working with them and I was terrible, but they would let me come in and watch them at the comedy connection.

Speaker 1:          00:37:46       The way they ran it and nick's and all those places in Boston. It was so cool because they, they had great comics. Would come in every weekend. You'd have guys that would come in like dom irrera. I saw him there. They would. They would all come like and have like a big name headliner. But they also had this insane community, have really great comedy around there as well. And the way they did it is because they super supported open milkers super supported the new talent. They knew that new talent is what becomes headliners one day and you have to nurture it. And they were like big about that. So when a guy like Hicks was in town, they would tell me like, you got to see Hicks. I'm Paul Barkley told me. He was like, you gotta see this guy. He's fucking tremendous. I go, that's the guy from the HBO special.

Speaker 1:          00:38:26       Right? And he's just like, yeah, but you got to see him. Like he's just, he's on another level. And then I remember seeing him for the first time and going, whoa. Like guys say they don't a fuck. Give a fuck. Everybody gives a fuck man. I always give a fuck if I give a fuck right now. Fuck what I'm stumbling through a squarespace commercial. I can't get my fat tongue to work. I give a fuck at the supermarket. I don't want to look dumb. Bill Hicks did not give a fuck man. I'm telling you. I saw the first guy in my life that didn't honestly didn't give a fuck on stage when I saw him because the first time I saw him we saw him twice in the same time period. He came, he was at the comedy connection and then he came to nick so shortly thereafter and I got to see them in both places.

Speaker 1:          00:39:08       The comedy connection was, was pretty fucking fascinating. But when he came to nick's, he went on after a guy that was doing like impressions of different, different cartoon animals, smoking pot. He had like literally had copped donut jokes. Um, I mean he was the guy who we went on before. It was a funny guy. He, but he was, it wasn't the same style of comedy by any stretch of the imagination. It was terrible setup for Bill Hicks because it was all like really dopey, you know, base shitty comedy. Right. Alright. Hooks goes on after him and just eats fat piles of Shit, just giant plates and plates of Shit and it's by the end of the show, there's maybe 300 people in this displacement, let's say to 50. There's maybe 50 left at the end of the show. Walk the entire crowd except for 50 people and me, Greg Fitzsimmons and like three or four other local Boston comics.

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       I can't remember the name. We were fucking crying. He didn't give a fuck. He was doing his bits as if he was killing and they were all dying. Right? Everything was dying. The crowd just did not bite except for this small core people that were in the back that were howling and the comics now. I just worked with somebody recently in Indianapolis who has been around for a long time and he said, Bill Hicks had a lot more dick jokes. Then you think, oh yeah, well he used to joke around about it. Spice up, you know, any other topic. You just throw Dick Jokes in between them to keep people interested. He would joke around about having to do that right where he joked, but folks, Dick Jokes are coming. I've heard that big fat via. Yeah, I've heard that. I mean he was a fascinating comic to me because he represents me.

Speaker 1:          00:40:55       I've had arguments with Ari about him because he doesn't think he was funny. He's a funny guy, but he's honest about it. He tells me, he goes, it's not funny. He's like, he's giving makes really good points, but he's not funny. What? What I. I disagree. I always laugh at him. I laughed at him when I saw him in [inaudible] 88. I laugh at it now, but what I think he represents is the first guy that started looking at what you talk about on stage completely differently. Like he started to a young man on acid. Like that whole bit about what? About a positive. It was really powerful. Like the non. What was non bullshit talk? It was. Was it a way? It was like when he was doing like certain bits, he wasn't just doing a bit. He was doing a bit that plants a seed and gets you thinking about a subject differently because he's mocked it so well that it whenever you try to seriously bring up the war on drugs after you've heard Bill Hicks talk about it, you seem like an asshole.

Speaker 1:          00:41:54       Right, right, right, right. Did he just had a. It was a fascinating way of mixing ideas into comedy in it. I think the most powerful way since Lenny Bruce, I personally think he's the most powerful at it because his, his impact is felt by I think a different era because of the, uh, because of Youtube. But because of the videos and the audio that's available, the, the Lenny Bruce Stuff, if you've tried to go back and listen to it now, it doesn't really hold up anymore. It's weird. So you can tell why it was groundbreaking at the time, but now it's just like, Huh. It's very like beat poet. Very like, yeah, rambling Hicks. I was on a totally different lens did in the eighties too, you know, like where there wasn't really a need for that. Yeah, it was the Reagan administration and the Bush one administration and people were getting by on who's squeezes the bottom of the toothpaste.

Speaker 1:          00:42:48       You know, and I'm no disrespect to Seinfeld, I can't believe. Where is that song? What's the deal? I can't believe whenever I think about Bill Hicks, I just can't believe he was dead and gone at 32. Yeah, that blows my mind. And when you're talking about that acid joke that's on tape one dangerous when he was 27. It's a brilliant. Yeah, I mean St I don't want to show you a tape of me and when I was 26, you don't want to see tape of him when he was 17 because he was funny. He was 17. He was going up at the fucking Houston annex and move 17 and was good. I know and he was clean and he, I mean clean as far as like his delivery was clean. It was really good stuff. It wasn't the embarrassing shit that would represent you or I know he would get lost in just.

Speaker 1:          00:43:34       This is based on the documentary that just came out. I saw a couple of years ago he would get lost and characters of his family and like he was just crazy funny and they keep it just as good as the guys that were twice as age fucking pancreatic cancer. Crazy, crazy fucking disease. That's a bad one to allegedly. Well, a lot of it is cigarettes. A lot of people believe that there's a correlation between cigarettes. Pancreas is a thing you can remove, right? It's like, does nothing. No extra parts. Right? Take it out and I'll be a lighter. Brian's education is based on operation. The board game, appendix, right? Uh, you can take your tonsils, your appendix, I think. Yes, you can take in your wisdom 10 decks. You definitely take out your appendix. What causes pancreatic cancer? Uh, aside from advanced age, smoking is the main risk factor.

Speaker 1:          00:44:24       Oh, great. A smoker's three to four times more likely than a nonsmoker to a acquire pancreatic cancer is your pancreas at who knows inside that that body thing. Cage, like in the main part, the main part, like a bulletproof vest. Cover it under the flip cage. What the fuck? Man? Cigarettes or so senior arm and Hicks smoked a lot of cigarettes and did jokes about smoking, argued for cigarettes, pancreatic cancer. Got Them motherfuckers. Well, so many really talented artists have smoke cigarettes. It's weird. It's sad. It's sad a lot of ways because it's like when I see a cigarette smoker, I don't see a person exercising their freedom. I know that's what they're doing. If they want to smoke, they should be able to smoke for sure, but that's not what I see. I see a person who's enslaved. Yes. That's what I see. I see enslavement to a habit and also to a drug at the same time.

Speaker 1:          00:45:18       It's just another addiction. It's just another thing to do but it kills you to kills a lot of. Doesn't get you high, but it's also a weird thing that you would get addicted to taking something lighting on fire and then putting it up to your mouth and then breathing it in like that. Just the ritual of doing that can become so ingrained in your life that it represents something like after sex, like people. Some people like to smoke a cigarette after sex. That's like a classic movie scene, right, where people have sex and then they smoke a cigarette you, but if you really like, what are you watching? They're watching someone poisoning themselves, like that's a weird thing to find romantic. That's a weird thing they snuck in on us and how it becomes habit study finds no link between secondhand smoke and cancer funded by the tobacco lobbyists of America in Florida.

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       It's in Florida. If you have a case that goes through in Florida, it might as well go through on the moon. They're not. Americans are tired of people saying the Florida's America to stop. We need to cut it out. Even flip live. My parents live in Florida. Don't get me wrong, I love Florida, but that shit is not America. That is some crazy spot where you can't. Any studies that come out of there, who knows? Who knows what kind of coke they were on when they made that study? They can't even trust him to vote. Right. I mean, that's fucked up. That's interesting. Nicotine and tobacco linked to heart disease. Well, nicotine speeds up your heart rate, doesn't it? It makes it work harder than it has to. Well, I've heard of nicotine being given as a supplement before, which is really bizarre. Or as medicine before, I think it was for a heart issue.

Speaker 1:          00:46:52       I find just like anything else in small doses, every once in a while I that bad, but a pack a day delivered through fucking cancer, a smoke and it's so hot. Yeah. Well a lot of stuff is like that, man. We were talking yesterday with Shane Smith from vice about that devil Columbian Devil's breath. It's called [inaudible] or something like that. It's dangerous. The most dangerous drug. It's the same shit that's in those little seasickness tabs that they put on you. You know, those things that you get stick they stick on you and the seasickness is supposed to be mitigated by this. That's the same shit at the Columbian Devil's breath stuff, but it's just like way more way more

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       patches, like barely giving you a hit. They're giving you just a taste. How do you take this dangerous stuff? Do you smoke it? You swallow it, you shoot it. What do you do? Uh, I think they can blow it in your face and you just have it in your face and you breathe, just breathing it in, like having it blown in your mouth and your nose. You got it, you're done. And then you become like, literally, like a little Zombie. They tell you what to do. I can tell you, go to your bank account, take out money for me. And people do. And like they have video of people doing this. Wow. Wow. Indeed. And it's the same fucking thing that you can get from these patches, these dermal patches for sisense. And then people go, don't be seasick. I concentrate on the horizon. Don't take anything else, give me $500.

Speaker 4:          00:48:14       It's, don't take those fucking don't think drama mean I took drama, mean, oh my God, I went into a dark dark coma. What is drawing me mean? I don't know. Drama man, pussies pussies like me that, uh, get on a boat and start getting sick. Right? Right, right. Well, apparently it alleviates nausea. Uh, but for me it was like a tranquilizer dart. It alleviated everything else to include in your sight. And your hearing even was seriously, my body was like this, we were, it was me and my buddy Jimmy, and luckily he didn't take the drama mean and uh, we were at the uh, the diner on the way home and I was just sitting in front of him nodding out like a heroin addict and he's like, you all right over there. He, you know, he might have actually taken a drama, mean to.

Speaker 4:          00:48:56       He was a lot bigger than me. Jimmy was like 200 plus pounds and that was probably at the time I was competing. So it was probably about 155 pounds and I took this one drama main or to drama names. I don't know how many they gave me, but I was gone. So I wake up, I woke up the next day. Really? Did you enjoy it on you? And Joe was terrible. I took too much probably. I probably tried to take as much as he was taken. I don't know what I'm going to ask you all. If you take two, I'll take two. Two guys doing guys. Especially that. I mean, we were both teenagers, right? That uh, but it fucking knocked my dick right in the dirt. Is that a prescription drug? I think so. It might be an over the counter. I don't know. I mean the laws might've changed since, uh, this is a long ass time ago.

Speaker 4:          00:49:45       Who knows? Her formula might have changed too. Right? But apparently I'm too much of a pussy to even take a drama, drama, drama me knowledge time. It doesn't do anything to them, not me. I'm literally, we're eating and I'm sitting here like this why we're eating sit straight. It felt so pathetic. It's pathetic when you falling asleep and someone asks you, are you falling asleep? Like, no. Right. Like why am I afraid to admit that I'm falling asleep? Oh yeah. When people call me, I always like, hey man, what's up? Are you sleeping? I'm sorry? Did like you always lie about something feminine about sleeping, man, I'm a man. I don't sleep. That's exactly what it is for weak bitch men

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       like ourselves for weak bitch cells. We don't want to admit facing my engine right now. I'm up at 6:00 every morning and doing sit ups crunches. I've worked my obliques. I don't sleep much sleep. It's like, Oh God, if the guy's really trying to be intimidating, he says he doesn't need much sleep. I gotta go vote, you know, four hours sleep at night and I got it. I got shit to do. I'm good. I'm good for hours. I'll to the house at 2:00 in the afternoon. Motherfuckers asleep on the couch. Was Dick in his hand watching days of our life with an open laptop nearby. Truly the fuck up bitch. I had shit to do. You need to sleep. Everybody needs sleep. How dare you. Sleep is the best I think you can get by on like if you really want to have like a low level mindset, you can get by on four hours sleep for a couple days in a row, but after that, let's be honest.

Speaker 1:          00:51:18       Like you're not functioning very well. You're, you're imbalanced. Four hours. Sleep at night. Yeah. You stood to have weird thoughts. Your brain doesn't work properly. It needs his rest. Maybe you bro. None me for hours. I'm good. You don't mind. Rem cycles are just very deep that go deep right away. I'm confident in myself, so I go to sleep very quickly. I'm not worried about predators. I go out and get it. I get all my work done, my sleep work. I get it done in four hours. My body is a unusual. It's very wolverine. Like if I get it scratched, people can't believe. The next day I'll quick. It's healed. It's just me, bro. It's just not normal. Not Normal. This is the Jimmy and joey sketch. This is a repeat every four hours a day. Sleep guy. That's my new character. Two thousand 13. I slept 16 hours so I don't give a fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:52:05       You know, I got a lot done. I have a new web series and working on right now. I'm very happy with built a shelf. You know, we had a fire to producer this fucking asshole. See my vision, but this guy sleeps six hours a day. Lazy piece of Shit. Where were we? Wrap up at midnight. I will see you guys at five. He was like, no, we need to turn around fucking turnaround. I'm here to work for production. People are like, I've heard you rag on that before. They're savages. They, they, they, they push people to work at ungodly hours and it's like standard in Hollywood. Fourteen hours is like regular total. Especially if you're working on a single camera drama show like those Csi shows and the other like those. I don't know, I'm wanting to say that one in particular, but a lot of those single camera like cop shows, those fucking people are working 16 hours a day, six days a week and the [inaudible] season is forever.

Speaker 1:          00:52:55       It takes forever to get 27 episodes of Aqap show done just so they can be like, I work in the movies. It's crazy. It's for folks that work on, on sets, it's like, um, there was a show that I did this hunting show that I do and when you want to talk about people that work hard to just show meat eater. And this dude who hosted, his name is Steven Rinella and he's got these guys that work for them specifically. This guy, Dan Toady and moe's the director and these fucking guys are working 16 hours a day on top of a mountain somewhere, freezing their asses off in a fucking tent and this is what they do every week. Every week they're flying a fucking Mexico to hunt a buffalo or flying to the Swiss Alps to kill some crazy sheep or something like that. Right? They got to kill animals and Itam on top of all these hours.

Speaker 1:          00:53:40       Well, they don't have to do that. They don't sometimes. Like sometimes they don't get an animal at all really, but the thing is like these guys that are working behind the scenes, like the cameraman, stuff like that. The guys were carrying shit like what a fucking hard, you know, to be expected to work like that. Like wow, you've got to find some special fucking people that are willing to work like that. Camping, we're going to go, I don't get to stop work at this. No. Stop work. When you're working, you fucking work while you're there. When you're not working, you're sleeping. You get up and everybody works again. No insomnia and production life. No, you're not allowed to, and they knock out the 40 hour work week in about two and a half day in the adderall flows like hail falls from the sky. Just pick it up and stuffed it into their mouth.

Speaker 1:          00:54:28       A lot of that. No, I don't know. Just guessing. I would say that if you were working on a set of like a show that was working like crazy hours all the time, you probably need at least a strong energy drink. Habit, coffee. Don't cut it at that point. Coffee. Don't cut it. Especially if you're not working on something for you. All right? If you're working on the mat, fold tron experience, Kaboom, and you've got an energy. You know what I'm saying? Like you have a chart and you're. You're plotting your future. Take over. You know what I'm saying? I know half George. You just, you're figuring out how you're going to set up these one man shows around the country who keep your comedy in a time capsule and they have all these people become the half charges. You're going to be fine, right? But if you're working on like that 70 [inaudible] show or something like that, how sad example, but you know something, some ridiculous show, some show where you don't give a fuck about the outcome, not just a job and you're there all day and you're there all day and you get to see whiny actors throw hissy fits and throw fucking scripts around to see the weirdness between the crew and the actors and Oh, fucking shit.

Speaker 1:          00:55:41       The amount of time invested put in all that. I know it's crazy because a regular person has a regular job. Like you work nine, you've done five. Maybe you have some extra things you have to tie up before you leave the office. Right? The office by six and like that's very. That's a lot of time. And let's be honest, there's some youtube and in there there's some office gods has been there. That's all your fucking employee really deserves. Your employer rather employer doesn't deserve your 100 percent of your time here because it's your life. That shit's ridiculous to have a job that sucks. You drive for 16 hours a day. It's almost, it's almost like you, it's obviously, I believe that people should have the free to do whatever the fuck they want. They want to pursue that sort of alive. But if you, if it's not something you enjoy doing, that's a really dangerous place to put your brain, right?

Speaker 1:          00:56:33       The fact that, okay, this is what we do. We do stuff that sucks for 16 hours a day where you hate it and then you get to be free. Some people don't want a life or don't want their own thoughts though. Is that what it is? Some people like to keep themselves busy and there's a little bit of that in standup comedy. It's like, I don't want to do Valentine's Day. I got to work that night, honey. Well, I see, I understand what it is as far as like the production budgets and um, you know, getting things done. And if days take longer, takes more time, cost more money. And so in order to fit things under budget or in their budget, they have to work these long hours, you know, that's just what they do and that there's, if they don't get a 12 hour turnaround, like they have to pay penalties and they pay meal penalties and all these union penalties that they have to pay if they.

Speaker 1:          00:57:16       But at the end of the day it's like, why is everybody choosing to work so crazy? Like I don't know. At the end of the day I understand you save a little money this way. I get it. Is there another way? There is another way it's called. It's shorter hours. Woody Allen does it. Does he? Television does it a lot of times. Fuck yeah, they sit. Does sitcoms do it? Yeah. By the time news radio is in its fifth season, we only worked three days a week. Nice. Yeah. Some we had done two days a week. We had done one day when we got the script and as we were going over the script, we have block and and like mark where the scenes are going to take place and that's what we'd rehearse it, go over it, do one run through and then film with the next day. Did you, do you really enjoy doing that show?

Speaker 1:          00:57:57       I really enjoyed doing that show, but I don't think I would really enjoy doing another show. Gotcha. Unless it was like that. Right. You know, like that was a really weird show because that show was. I don't know how it is on most sitcoms because I've only. The only other one I've done is just shoot me. I did one episode of that. I did one episode of Mad TV. I did. I didn't really do much other than that, but when I was on news radio and they let us ad Lib like almost every scene. That's awesome. Like almost every scene there was something that was changed, something that was altered, something that was someone, one of us came up with on the fly and most of the time orchestrated by Dave Foley. Like Day Foley would take the script and then he was, he was sort of, it was an ensemble show, but if anybody was the lead, it was day four and it was Phil Hartman who was the big star and then, you know, Dave Foley was, you know, kind of like, I always felt like he was like a, like an uncredited producer really.

Speaker 1:          00:58:55       Right. And he would orchestrate like a lot of the scenes and come up with fantastic lines for them to. He's a really fucking talented guy. And then all the guys that I think don't get appreciated enough for being fucking unbelievably hilarious. One of them is Dave Foley. He's such a sweetheart of a guy, like always has been. Always been like the nicest, kindest guy and really, really, really fucking smart. Really fucking smart and really fucking funny to such a cool dude. Always was now. And I'm and, and I think he's doing standup now to really. Yeah. That's not his background, right? He's more of an Improv guys. He was a, he was one of the guys from kids in the hall. Yeah, I know that much. Yeah. You've watched kids in the hall? Yeah, but after the fact I watched it like after it was, you know, reruns.

Speaker 1:          00:59:43       So good. Yeah. It's such a fucking good stuff. Yeah. So good. What was that on originally? Canadian television. What was that on? What? Like kids in the hall? Where did it originally aired? That's a good question. I think it was Canadian. Yeah, I think it was Canadian TV. Yeah. And then we found out about it in America and then those kinds of came down here. But, um, I don't remember my original point. I just got product caught up in this Dahlia production. It's insane. When you were asking me that was where it was, you were asking me whether or not, uh, I enjoyed doing it. I said I enjoyed doing it, but the way it was done was so wild and crazy. Almost after every filming everybody was getting hammered more drunken moment talks with like Maura Tierney and day fall within any other humans in my whole life.

Speaker 1:          01:00:29       That's these like crate and especially for me back then like, oh, it's such an emotional mess. Really. Yeah. Because I was, you know, my late twenties, I had just gotten into, stand up, just got done fighting, just gotten into stand up and then moved out to la and I didn't know what the fuck I was doing. I didn't believe I was on TV two years ago. I was broke as fuck, right. Barely getting by as a comic and then all of a sudden I'm sitting here with Dave fucking Foley and Phil Hartman and we're going over the lines of the show we're on. I'm like, I didn't make any sense. So you had trouble accepting that or it was just like weird. It's just weird. So crazy. And so, you know, we had these wild drunken fucking parties after the, after the shows for time, like they were crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:01:12       They were very punk rock. Dave Foley like really embraced some sort of a punk ideology for the whole thing. And the producers, like, especially Paul Simms who was the guy who created it, wrote it, the head writer, and he would just let the funniest stuff go through. Like he just wanted it to be the funniest. So he wrote, he wrote really funny shit and really creative shit and they would let you know, Phil Hartman ad Lib or Andy Dick and Andy Dick ad libbed a lot of shit. Yeah. He would just take something and just run with it, you know, figure out a better way to do it. And everybody was always tweaking their lines. They're always trying to figure out like, what is this? Is it this or is it just a. Oh yeah, that one, that one, you know, we would help each other like that. I think that's, I don't really know, but I kinda think that's a huge vote. Paul. And a lot of sitcoms. You respect the writers. Is this flubs? Yeah, Ben's a bloopers. I made to take a piss. It's unbelievable. I can't believe that. I don't know this.

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       Uh, so great. It was awesome. I think it will be called free. Willie's billy free. Billy's Willie Bell. That's so crazy. I remember that flub count for freaks.

Speaker 6:          01:02:58       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:03:04       it's funny. Fun Times, man. Yeah. But what he was talking about was, or what are the. The question was whether I would do something like that again, like you'd never find a show like that. They're probably never going to make one like that again. That show went under the radar. It was like while it was on, it was a, it was so like ignored that it was sort of allowed to be what it became because they fucked with it a little bit. Like I know they brought in like a couple of romantic characters and they brought a woman into the office once. You're not Lauren Graham, the woman from the Gilmore girls Saturday. Lauren Graham? I think so. We'll find. Is that her name? She's so hot. She's really cool. She was on news radio for a season. Yeah. So was um, Patrick Warburton. The guy when you go to a soaring over California, is that it?

Speaker 1:          01:03:52       Lauren Green Long Graham. She's really fucking funny and really cool. Like, you know, a lot of actresses. They're like, when you're talking to them, you're talking to your representative. Do you ever try? No. That we worked together. She's a very cool though. Very nice person. She was fun to hang with. Like, she's like, she, she could joke around, she was lively, they brought her in, but other than that they didn't really, um, didn't really fuck with it, you know, they kind of let Paul to his thing and that's why it was so weird. I just, unless he get a show like that. No, because once you do a show like that, you realize like, that's like I went from a show before that we did a show on Fox called hardball and hardball. Was this like really bad show baseball? It was terrible. Fucking terrible. And there was a mascot that was a big baseball.

Speaker 1:          01:04:39       Yeah. And the show was awesome and got destroyed. Okay. Guys who wrote it? Jeff Martin and Kevin currently believe they, um, they were for writers from married with children. There were writings from the sentence, really funny guys. They were really good and they put together this fucking bad ass script and the pilot was like really well written. It was really good stuff. And then as soon as the show got picked up, these guys were kind of like, they were a soft spoken to really friendly, really nice guys. And just kind of soft spoken and the network didn't think that they were strong enough to run a show like they thought you needed to be strong. So they booted these guys out and it brought in this super duper hacker, richest dude. I mean, he was a hacker [inaudible]. It was terrible. Like every terrible cliche in a scene.

Speaker 1:          01:05:29       This guy would insert in there. His writing was just insanely bad. He was from that show, coach member I've ever coached. Well he had come from the air somehow or another and he had gotten on this show and I watched the show get destroyed. And so going from that to seeing the news radio way, which is a weird thing where no one ever got famous from the show. The show was always almost going to get canceled and limped into five years and didn't even get to 100 episodes. We were two episodes shy, which is like almost for the show, like prophetic, you know, that's, that's what we are, which is bad. But because of that, because the no pressure, no start, um, no craziness. No, not too much. Network interference. Brilliant. Producer. It became this weird environment where there's all this ad libbing and all this, you know, rechanging of things in very dynamic and really funny stuff that you're proud to tell someone that you worked on.

Speaker 1:          01:06:22       Right. So once you've done that, it's really hard to do a shitty one like the hardball when again. Right. And most likely that's where you're going to run into this. It's hard to do. It's fucking silent movies, man. That's what it is. You gotta you gotta fake laughs and there's a silent movies. It's hard to keep that art form alive, you know. And so you guys were riffing in front of the audience while the cameras are rolling. Oh yeah. All the time. It's so awesome. We'd written in front of the cameras. Dave would oftentimes change a line, like on the fly, like come up with something that was funnier because his background had been live performing. Right? So he knew how to come up with stuff on the fly. Is that hardball? Oh God. I remember when this is on, it was only on for like six episodes.

Speaker 1:          01:07:05       I think we did seven, but only six of them ever made it to the air. It's just they just. It just got butchered, but that's what happens a lot of the time because in the business of TV, what people were trying to do is make a shitload of money and these producer guys, they're there, they want to control everything and they want to make a shitload of money and if they are allowed to, if they get into a situation where they do it, you can't be surprised that they do and they don't know that their ideas suck. They think they're awesome, which is why they have the job. So they push forward thinking that these awesome ideas that aren't so awesome actually are going to change this show for the better. Like they're not trying to fuck it up, but he fucked it up. When you see stuff like that, you're like, I don't.

Speaker 1:          01:07:44       There's too many people. I'll just do podcasts. Yeah, exactly how many people you've got to deal with. So yeah. Whoops. I heard Seinfeld talking about how like that was one of the only shows where they were like, no we don't. I think it was Larry. David was like, no outside influences and he was always willing to walk before he was even anybody before he even had any money in the bank. Well, I don't know how true that is, but I bet it's true. Then they initially like shows always get fucked with in the beginning. I mean unless you bring in like unless it's Martin Scorsese and speed Steven Spielberg team up together for some new miniseries. I'm pretty sure that network is going to shut the fuck up on that. Right. But until that happens, they have some say and they, they want to, they want to throw their own special spice into the zoo.

Speaker 1:          01:08:28       I like coriander. Can we put coriander in this suit? Yes. You fuck with your coriander? I'd throw it in there. We're watching your soup get ruined. Right? There's, you know, it's a business. A lot of people involved. It's just like anything else. It's just like the design of a car or the box that the corn flakes come in. A lot of people have their say, a lot of people have opinions and there's, you know, there's a lot of weird desk going on and you wouldn't, you know, as well as I do that when you're trying to create something, especially if you try and create something funny, the less shit you have coming in, the better when it comes to like, like outside of the creative sphere, you know, the less people. Once you get down to a core group of very competent individuals like writers and artists are sitting together and trying to compile the correct way to do something and they're working on it very hard if they're a functional group, that should be where that ends.

Speaker 1:          01:09:18       Right. Okay. When producers come in and they, all of a sudden they have line reads and they're like, well, why doesn't he just like, Oh, fucking Christ. Why did you hire writers? Dude, why don't you just do everything right when she's here. Once you write a script that happens all the time to. They'll tell a producer once you write a script, and a lot of producers think that Ken writes scripts, right? So they'll go and they'll write scripts and then those writers, we'll pass it around amongst their friends and fucking giggle. Bad. It sucks. Right? I had that on a really small level when I first started doing stand up, I got this management group and they're like, we're gonna try to base a sitcom around the fucking five minutes that you actually have and every month. And it wasn't just me, it was a bunch of guys that they managed every month they would have these shows where they would go to and then they would give us suggestions on how to write sets that would inspire sitcoms.

Speaker 1:          01:10:09       Wow. And I actually got pretty far down the pike with it. I had like castle rock and we were pitching and everything. There was this, this was 2002, 2002. Yeah. Wow. There was still doing a lot of sitcoms back then. There's still the development deal game back then because that was the first year of fear factor. So that was when reality shows were just starting to take off. A survivor was first and then was a couple of other ones and then there was a, you know, NBC had fear factor and a couple of other ones and then it was just reality shows like Jon and Kate plus eight and all these other motherfuckers just spewed onto the scene. And then there was the influx of reality shows over the last decade. It's pretty crazy. It's unbelievable. Two thousand two that wasn't really going on as much as a lot of sitcoms. Yeah. Where's that sweet, sweet sitcom in the aftermath. Full trump didn't happen. I smell a smell. That sweet, sweet sitcom money. Everybody wants that. Sweet. Sweet. I know, I know. It's not even a game anymore in a way. It's not really game. People go, wow, here we go. Where's

Speaker 4:          01:11:15       I'm 25 years old and then picture and I like your little. You got a little beads on, you have one of these things on. It was a, it was a, um, a stainless or a sterling silver bracelet. Where'd you find that picture? A hardball website. Isn't Jim? Is Jim backup and see if Jim Burrows in there and Jim Brewer was in the pilot. He played the baseball, the pilot. They really played the, uh, he played the original mascot that got beat up by the baseball. He played, uh, the Pied Piper because I think we used to be the pied pipers. Then we became the pirates or something like that. Right. Or we can whatever the fuck we became, I forget what the name of the actual team was, but a brewer. The funniest part of the pilot was brewer brewer dancing around and getting in a fight with this fucking baseball. Wow. That's so crazy. That's an evil looking baseball right there

Speaker 7:          01:12:06       is this guy right here.

Speaker 4:          01:12:08       Think garland right there. I'm like, no, it's Mike Star. Mike Star was in the bodyguard. He was in Goodfellas. Right. It's been a lot of movies. I guarantee you macro recognize if you saw him. Super Cool Guy, man. That's The star track dad right there. Captain Kirk's dad to the far left.

Speaker 4:          01:12:29       Bruce Greenwood. He was on the show too. And that's that. Do this on that. A kid's show, you know, that kid show kitchen, one of those really popular kid shows. He plays like he's got a character on. I, I catch them on like nickelodeon and all the time. And there's Derek jeter that due to the far right. Forgot his fucking name man. He was a cool guy too though. God dammit. I can't remember his name. But uh, that was the dude that got hit in the teeth with a pipe in, in Russia. I will tell you that story. Yeah. A buddy of mine, that guy was there, uh, doing some movie and he turned the corner and some guys smashed him in the face of pipe, knocked him out cold. His teeth were shattered. Oh yeah. He told me matter of faculty to. He's a tough fucking dude. So how was Russia? He goes, well, you see these teeth? Yeah, I got them because I was in Russia. I go, what happened? This man turned a corner at some dude smash me in the fucking jaw with a pipe, broke my teeth out.

Speaker 4:          01:13:27       That was it. No complaining and whining. And I was like, you know, I mean, slick. No, everywhere I go, I worried someone's gonna hit me. He barely gave a fuck that this guy hit him in the face of the pipe and not to have his teeth. His teeth look better. Now I'm telling you, this dude barely gave a fuck. It was a, it was a tough dude. I don't know what he ever went on to do, but I do know is a really strange thing. I saw he got something, some sort of a uh, like a new show or something like that. Some, he got like a, a part in something that he was really excited about. And his girlfriend at the time who was also an actress, started openly crying when he received the good news and

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       she kept saying like, when is something going to happen for me? Oh, when is something going to happen for me? And she's crying men. And I was like, wow, this port I've, I felt bad for her brain works that way. I was like, this poor kid, like, look at this crazy brain pattern. She's on weird self-absorbed brain pattern, but that's the Hollywood way, man. That's definitely the acting way. I mean, Christ, a lot of it, it's a lot of lottery plan. I mean a lot of them aren't that with the problem is the, even the best. Not that much better than some guy that's doing community theater in Oakland, you know, it's probably some bad motherfucker that can't keep his shit together. Smokes a little bit too much. Drinks a little bit too much. But when he gets his shit together and gets, you know, gets a hold of a script, he could probably fuck it up.

Speaker 1:          01:15:00       Right. But he's just never been gotten the right acting fucking agent or agency or parts or they always a part of it goes to and Pharaoh when he gets close, fuck it. But the difference between a guy who's really good and the difference between a guy who's really famous as far as like what's valuable in a lot of ways, it's like how much better is the good guy? Then the famous guy, because you've got to be a lot better because if you're not a lot better, I'm going to go with a famous guy because people go to see if God Damn Tom Cruise movie, you know, so like they, they have a hard road. Absolutely. Show. Did you see his picture? So it's like all the guys sitting here and then you're like, had a fucking baseball bat that a woman is Rosemarie. She's from, I think it was the Dick van dyke show or something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:15:48       Wow. I think it was the Dick Van Dyke show, but I remember I was embarrassed that I didn't know. Um, yeah, I think I never seen the Dick van dyke show. It's weird. I've never seen the Mary Tyler Moore show. Well that's not as weird. The Dick Van Dyke show is weird because Mary Tyler Moore is really young. They're A. Yeah, she was on the Dick Van Dyke show. I never watched it. So when everybody's like, that's Rosemarie, like people on the set with like Rosemary. And I'm like, oh, like what the fuck does that mean? This is before wikipedia folks. No one knew anything back then. God Damn. We were stupid in 1993. Human beings were monkeys. We were monkeys with a o railroad system. Had a language and cars. What you can do, go to the encyclopedia and look it up. Yeah, we're so much fucking smarter now, but it was interesting because after I'd met her, she was.

Speaker 1:          01:16:39       She was getting on in age and she's still alive. She's born in Nineteen, 26, so to to be able to look back and see her. After I met her then I watched the Dick Van Dyke show and I got to look back and see her on what was like for a lot of people that were alive at the time. That was an iconic program and so I was like, oh, now I know why these older people that were on the set were like freaked out that she was like, Jesus Christ would be weird to be on television if you were born and lived before television was even invented often. Yeah, I mean I know you looked it up before and it was invented way back before it was common. Right. But still it wasn't common until the fifties. Yeah. And people that they barely had enough money to buy one of those gigantic furniture things you would roll into your living room and occupy a good solid 10 square feet of space.

Speaker 1:          01:17:31       Um, see if you could brian see if you could find the Dick van dyke show, like a highlight or clip of a show on, um, on, uh, Youtube. Yeah, she's a very nice lady though. She was very funny too. She still does. I'm sure she's still alive. But um, like I said, man, it ain't easy for everybody. Shares a lot. A lot of people that don't get a shot. The thing about acting that's kind of fucked is a, how many people out there would be awesome at it if they apply themselves. There's a lot of friends that we have that don't act at all. But if they really decided to be bad ass actors, that would be incredible at it. Right. And I think there's a lot of people that work, like a lot of regular jobs that they decided to apply themselves to it.

Speaker 1:          01:18:13       They could be awesome at actress, but yeah, but the thing is like, like getting, getting like discovered like the, the sheer numbers of fucking people that are coming here. Like what do you think? Like if a role comes out for a movie, like let's just say the full charge writes a movie. Yeah, for you. I feel action sort of hand to hand combat specialists. Let's go with the mat fold. Try to Pakistan to fucking rectify some shit. Some shit. Some people that are just, they can't. They don't know how to make a deal work smoothly and sometimes you got to knock a little and you've got to be able to do both and that's what the full charges here for. I'm like Seagal. It's like the movie tells you what I am. Matt. False. Ron is the full charge and I just knock out terrorists and I fucking saved the world constantly. I see that being on Spike TV in the fall of 2016. If we are our cards correctly, we gave them a little taste by talking about it here on the podcast.

Speaker 8:          01:19:11       Let the pitch meetings begin. Let's watch this. God Damn Mary Tyler Moore, Mary Tyler Moore.

Speaker 4:          01:19:26       Good craziness. Death of the party. Just the way people pretended that people were back then is weird. Sleep in the same bed. At least look at this. Yeah, that is pretty sexy. No, they don't man. Look at the separation between the two beds. Right? Oh my God. I'm so sad now. She's so hot and she's right there and he has to sleep in the next bed. That is bullshit, but doing it from behind was with a lot more popular back then because you had that extra gap so yours is always probably just leaned over the bed. I don't think people really live like that, dude. No they didn't. It was TV,

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       TV, TV rules. They would never show. They would see gives. If you have people sleep in the same band together, you're implying that they're fucking. Don't want to imply that this is wholesome. Dick Van Dyke is father knows best. Just wants to play golf. That's it. Yeah. He's just trying to sneak out and play some golf. Ain't trying to fuck his wife. What he's doing right now is running from the prison warden who tells him that he can't do what he wants to do with his life. Sushi master. God, she's so hot though. They cute. Cute prison warden. Look, she wakes up with her hair. Perfect. Amazing. She's got full war paint on and her hair is perfect.

Speaker 6:          01:20:42       Look at that.

Speaker 1:          01:20:45       This is so weird, man. Because this is like a time capsule.

Speaker 5:          01:20:49       Oh boy.

Speaker 1:          01:20:52       Curse word back then. This shit hadn't been done before. We're watching some shit that like

Speaker 5:          01:20:57       what happened to got the spark plugs. I was so proud. I dressed by shape and AIPAC and got out without waking you up and it was so brad, you had to come back and tell him, Hey, I forgot my keys and my money. I'm sorry. Oh yeah. I'm sorry honey. Look what? She wears the bed. I closed the door and when the money. Honey, I'm sorry.

Speaker 6:          01:21:33       Get over it.

Speaker 5:          01:21:34       So you still mad at me from last night? No, I'm not mad now and I wasn't mad last night.

Speaker 1:          01:21:42       This would be a weird sort of a piece. If someone decided to recreate this show, the exact sort of inflection, right?

Speaker 5:          01:21:51       It's not, I'm inconsiderate. I mean if I'm anything but I did consider a guilty. I'm guilty of is talking to you right now where there are three guys waiting for me to tee off, darling. Oh, did you get it? I get it.

Speaker 3:          01:22:05       You get that one, get that. Can you imagine that? At one point in time that was cutting edge. That was, I was like saying go fuck off. It's really weird watching old shit like that. Did you see? Uh, I was listening to Opie and Anthony and they were talking about, uh, the house from the future that they used to have, whereas like in the future we're going to have and they, and they were showing them how much similarities of what they guessed the house of the future was what show was it on the, they had it, it was back back in the day. It used to be at epcot or it used to be at Disneyland. It used to be this building. You walked in and was like, in that future, this is what it tells. So it was a ride, kind of. It's like a standing right. If I remember, I'll show you. They have the video online, but the guests, things like, you know, a microwave, microwave, online shopping, they guessed. Really? Yeah. That's fascinating. Wow. So, so is there anything in there that the, that we don't have Brian? Uh, yeah, there, there was a lot of spinning

Speaker 4:          01:23:07       the wheels but in young Mr. I can't think of an old charge enterprises, but I'm going to do is I'm going to go, I'm going to watch old shit with the predicted the future. Find out what happened and what didn't and then pick up the pieces. Is there a mailbox that blows you gail? Cancel all my appointments. Yeah. Here's the, here's some photos from what it used to be. Oh Wow. So what was this, when was this created? What year? I believe it was the 19 five. Nineteen 57 to 1967. And it was called, believe it or not, the Monsanto House. Monsanto. You fucking devil. And uh, that's hilarious. How's the view? Yeah, but I, I remember going to, I think it was at epcot when I went to it. Wow. And I'll find a video. The video is actually, there's a house that was a. I wonder if it's still up. There was a house in the Hollywood hills somewhere that I saw. Not In person ever, but I've seen it in photos that looks like a Ufo. Have you ever seen? I've never seen that. Now I'm gonna find it on Google, the flying saucer house. James [inaudible] fired or Brian Flying

Speaker 4:          01:24:29       saucer house.

Speaker 1:          01:24:32       I think it's in Holland when, but uh, it's so wicked. It's a house though that once you lived in it for a little while, he'd be like, all right, this is ridiculous. Look at it. How dope is that? Right.

Speaker 4:          01:24:45       The encounter at lax, that restaurant. But this is someone's fucking house, man. Yeah, no kidding. Someone's chilling in that house. Okay. I take it back. That's, that's Uber Dope. I would love to learn that. It's like living in this space needle. Look at this photo. Wow. Let's try it to see if he can pull that one up so that you stream people can see it. This fucking house is radical. You might even survive an earthquake or an avalanche or something in that. You would be worshiped by Star Trek and star wars geeks and where's this at Hollywood hills or somewhere in Hollywood.

Speaker 1:          01:25:17       I'm John Lottner by John Lautner. He's the guy who created it. I'm wondering when this was built. Oh, okay. It was a construction back in 1960, but it was recently renovated. Huh? God, that's fucking wicked house is incredible. They're so cocky though, like local people do in California, they take a hill in a place where the ground moves all the fucking time and they just stick a big spike right down the middle and put a circle on it. Says they'll stay here.

Speaker 4:          01:25:51       I can't believe no one lives in the death star or whatever. No one's recreated that they'll live in. You just put out a fucking awesome message into someone's gonna. Run with that. Make sure you finish it guys. You don't want to leave any weak spots. Now should. He didn't make it full size, full charge where they would have to to satisfy me starting in space. What are we doing? I don't know. That's for the nerds to figure out. Get on at boys. Seriously though. If you're a single guy. Full charge. Yeah. No, you are and you're looking to be sly and you look at it. Really impressive Gal with where you live in two dozen roses, two dozen roses at the fucking the Ufo House. You bring her up to the Ufo House. This chick thinks you're balling. I want you to look at a view my friend. Look at the fucking view from this place.

Speaker 4:          01:26:35       That's what that shit. That's so awesome. Come on. That's so awesome. That view of Los Angeles at night is a really crazy view. Have you ever seen that view, Brian? You ever been on top of Doheny? Yeah. I would go up and down. Look at that shit. It never disappoints. Men who would look at that fucking view. That's insane. That that is an incredible picture. This house is so weird because it's just surrounded by glass because of is a Ufo theme. Yeah. It's kind of amazing that there's not more of these like really weird freaky houses in Hollywood. You would think there would be a lot of like weird, unusual. I guess by the time you can afford a house you've kind like got rid of all those crazy ideas about living in a fucking. Yeah, I think so. And like if you do come up with a crazy plan for it.

Speaker 4:          01:27:21       If you're an architect and you've got to find somebody who's crazy enough to do it, but he also wants to find like the homeowner's association has to agree. That's a big deal in California, right? They say no to a lot of stuff, don't they? It's a big deal everywhere. I was reading about this woman who's getting in trouble because she was a in Florida, in Miami. She's growing vegetables in her front lawn because that's the only part of her house that gets hit by son. So she's grown her vegetables there. She's been doing it for like 17 years and they trying to get her to stop, like, like the city is coming in and telling a lady stopped growing healthy food on her property. It's fucking vegetables to have invested. Like someone's going to walk by. They're going to be offended if they see a tomato plant.

Speaker 4:          01:27:59       Yeah. Like what the fuck kind of craziness is that? Why are you telling people they can't have food up? What could grow? Anything else? Yes, she can and she's allowed to grow flowers. She grow fucking pine trees. Probably thinks she wants. Can't grow marijuana. Full charge. That shit's illegal, dude. That shit is illegal. Especially down in that country. Known as Florida. Oh, Florida. Not America or California, right? This guy made star Trek House. Whole entire house is just like the ship. Do you hear that? That's the sound of a million panties. Getting wet. That's fucking dope. Look at this guy's house. Look at his fucking. Even as fireplace. He did up his fireplace. You ever seen that documentary? Trekkies? Yes. Long time ago. Dedicating their lives. Yeah. There's a lot of people that just get obsessed with anything, whether it's world of warcraft being a trekkie, being a furry and trails, chem trails, anything.

Speaker 4:          01:28:54       Do you ever see that? All of a sudden that live sketch where William Shatner is at a a trekkie convention? Oh No. He just tells off all the trekkies John Lewis. He's like, yeah, you're 30. You ever kissed a girl? He's like, you took something fun. I did in the sixties and turn it into a colossal waste of time. How rude. Yeah. I wonder how the trekkies felt about that trade. It was one of the first like trekkie things on tv, you know, so they probably appreciated that they were being recognized. Yeah. It's kind of an interesting, like what shows

Speaker 1:          01:29:26       take off with that. It's not like star trek went on forever. It went on for a few years. I think it was five. Was it five years? I don't think it was that many. I think it was more like three. Let's say Star Trek was a great fucking Cheryl. I'll tell you that, but it's amazing that like, okay, here's another perfect example. The, uh, the fucking rocky hard midnight show, whatever it is, when they do the rocky horror picture show at midnight ones and they have these people get up and they sing along to the music they were, they throw rice, they wear the clothes that everybody's wearing and in the music and the musical, they still do it at the new art, like once a month, once a week. How's that one take off? Like why that would is, what is it about the rocky horror picture show that makes everyone want to get together and watch it over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Have these midnight screenings and everybody loves it and they dress up and it's, it's a community. Yeah. But if forms over this one fucking weird movie,

Speaker 4:          01:30:19       it's all such a fucking perfect storm of events that comes out at the right time, right? When people notice it doesn't hurt.

Speaker 1:          01:30:28       The movie is fucking bad ass. One time viewing is a bad ass movie. It's very good. Rocky horror picture show is a very good movie. I love that movie. Especially at the time. I don't know how it holds up to get today might be a little absurd. Knowing all the rocky horror picture show shit behind it. That's one thing I'm very aware of but don't know anything about. So I've never seen it and I don't. Yeah. It's because it's, it's also a time capsule. I should probably see it again to four. I recommend it because, you know, I've, I've watched um, the uh, altered states moving that uh, William hurt movie about isolation tanks. I watched it and I thought it was the most amazing movie ever got me into isolation. Tanks got me researching and eventually got me to own one. So it was like a pivotal moment in my life seeing that movie and I remember it being very good. High wants to

Speaker 4:          01:31:14       dog shit is terrible. I've barely gotten. Not only that, I tried to talk Mrs Rogan into Washington with me. Watch this shit with me for five minutes. She was like, Oh fuck, are you so bad man, it's missing so much that makes a movie good. And then you don't get to pick the movie again for another three or four choices. Do you know, talking about full trust me.

Speaker 1:          01:31:44       Yeah. It's weird how movies don't fucking hold up. It's a lot of them don't, but a lot of them do, but it's so strange. Like watch the Godfather. It's perfect. It's God damn perfect gem. It's. There's nothing wrong with it. Everything is great about it. I can't imagine goodfellas ever been bad. It's impossible. It's impossible. It's a perfect movie. There's movies that are just so good. It doesn't matter if someone else achieved great heights as well. Yeah, that movie's still gonna stand no matter what era it's shown in. Especially in consideration between like what technology was available to shoot a movie like that then as it was when it was, what's available today. You know, it's good when not even Martin Scorsese can top it. He's the one that did it. There you go. One flew over the cuckoo's nest holds up. Fuck. Yeah, it does.

Speaker 1:          01:32:32       That's a timeless. A theme, right? The Nicholson was I bad motherfucker when he was young. You know, people remember Nicholas who's sitting in front of court at the Lakers game and when he pretended to be a wolf and they remembered some stupid shit, Nicholson, but go back to China town watch Nicholson and China town. He was a bad motherfucker. Dude. China. China town is another one. Chinatown holds up. He was so bad. He was so good in Chinatown. We talked about it last time I was here. 10 signs point to China, I swear to Christ, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How did we get to them as a major talent to separate and isn't crazy conspiracies. Crazy. Full charge. I don't even know how it happened. I Nicholson was the original full charge Chinese secret. He did a lot of fucking great movies to men and you know, he's still got it.

Speaker 1:          01:33:18       Like that movie, the departed. He was still growing. He's still great. He's just. And he has like moved seamlessly from young hot guides, old, creepy guy seamlessly. Like there was a show recently, you know, that fast and loud. You know, that show I don't think I do enough. Fast and loud is those guys, uh, in Dallas, they have cars and they have a, it's called gas monkey garage place and they take cars, they buy them, they fix them up and they resell them, sell them at auction and sell them to collectors. It's funny show. I enjoy it. Um, and fuck. What was my point? Nicholson? Fuck God. Oh, that's what it is. Okay. I'm sorry I got distracted because it's a really good shot. Right? They did an episode with Burt Reynolds. That's where I got distracted. They were redoing a trans am and the Trans am was the burt reynolds firebird from smokey and the bandit car.

Speaker 1:          01:34:10       Perfect car for like when you're in high school, like during those, that those days when smoking the band was on. That was the fucking car. Yeah. Oh my God. It's a firebird. Trans Am. Woo. The flames on the hood and Shit. I mean it was an amazing car for like several years because of burt reynolds. But dude, burt reynolds is fucked. Like he's hunched over. They had him in there signing. He's hunched over. Great Hair, incredible hair. It's ridiculous. He's his face. Has been operated on way too many times. Yeah, it's strange and he's got sunglasses on and you remember him from like deliverance. This virile, strong, like dangerous looking dude who had just gotten done playing football essentially. You know, he'd played football in college in Florida and went from there into the movies. He was a bad mother fucker, but you, he couldn't make that transition.

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       Now you can become the old guy. The spread couldn't make the spread. Couldn't be himself throughout the ages. Where is Nicholson? The hair started falling out. No toupee. Just show up to her award. Shows his hair all fucked up. He big balls by. Doesn't give a shit. He was always a freaking, oh, he's an artist so he can kinda roll with it. He rolled with everything rolled with getting fat. He just kept getting fatter and fatter and fatter. And he was in that movie with a share where he played the devil or something like that. You remember that movie? She devils or something? There were witches. Witches of Eastwick. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. And he was already like fat and creepy. Then you know, he like made this transition seamlessly, right? So him and Burt Reynolds probably very similar in age, but he looks great and you look at Logan Nicholson, he looks great.

Speaker 1:          01:35:43       He looks like an old guy and he was at the game the other day or floyd mayweather fight and he's eating popcorn while they're interviewing him. Chewing Pie. You're not stopping for your camera if you want to talk to Jack while he's fucking watching the fights. He's going to eat popcorn, but you don't feel sad for him, right? You see burt reynolds, you're like, Jesus Christ. Look at this poor guy like his bond. He's all hunched over. He looks like he weighs maybe 100 pounds. I'm not even kidding. He's got the wig on. He's got his face is drawn from surgery and weird and shiny. He's gotten. This is kind of spark. He's got no life. It's. It's depressing. It's depressing when you consider like how funny he was. If you go watch smokey and the bandit, it's another time capsule, but it's hard to see.

Speaker 1:          01:36:26       It's hard. He doesn't even look like that now. Man. You know what's weird about smokey and the bandit? I watched it a couple of years ago. There's no. There's no one under 30 in that movie. Right, and they don't do that movies anymore. It's all like young hot shots smoking the band. It was fun, man. The only young people that hadn't smoked in the band, it was people that almost got hit by cars on the baseball field when when they jumped and started driving on a baseball field. How great is the Jackie gleason in that movie? Burt Reynolds had that. He was great. Jackie. Jackie gleason was awesome. Moving. What was that one? I'm trying. Sorry to interrupt you, but I remember this one. Burt Reynolds movie. I think it was domino. Was that what it's called?

Speaker 1:          01:37:05       Hold on. Raynald's. That's a weird way to spell it. Real good. That sexy motherfucker Joe, look at at. He made the hairy chest sexy. Oh, hold me back. So a lot of God damn movies. Stick Sharkey's machine. That was it. Do you remember that moving out or burt reynolds? It was a good movie man bird. It was a cop movie and at the time I fucking loved it. It only has a six point two. I bet if I watched today, I think it sucks, but I was 14 years old and burt reynolds played a bad ass in this, uh, who's in narcotics cop and Atlanta to mobile device after a botched bust and the depths of this lowly division while investigating a high dollar prostitution ring. Sharkey stumbled across a mob murder with government

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       ties. Isn't it funny when you read like crazy are super overly dramatic movie read like the description you're like, what kind of life is this? All this keeps happening to you. Starkey stumbled, shockey stumbles across a mob. Murder with government ties and responds by assembling is downtrodden fellow investigators, Sharkey's machine to find the leaders and bring them to justice. Meanwhile, most cops are bored out of their fucking minds is sitting around the office. No evidence, no nothing. I bet it's terrible if I watch it today, but Goddamn, I liked it at the time when I was 14. Did he ever go mustache lists as he mustache? Listen, Boogie nights? I don't think he. I don't know. He, he loved the mustache man. He wore it a lot. Do you have tape over your Webcam? Yeah, you don't. I don't want people seeing me being tired of the NSA.

Speaker 4:          01:38:44       Oh, you know what it was, but I actually had a tape that they put over this thing from filming the show. They wanted to cover my apple logo and I had an extra piece and I put it over the camera as a goof and then just left it there. I met this girl the other day that had a camera or on me and on her phone she had tape on the front end tape on the back like a crazy person because she's like an FBI agent. Well now people are afraid of the NSA, the NSA, tuning into your laptop. If you look through a million hours of me, you're going to see in me in front of the computer and then 10 percent of those times I'll be beating off. That's you going to say. So if you need to see that. Still not a crime through that thing, but like why would anybody want to go through that data?

Speaker 4:          01:39:28       What are you trying to prove? I just tell you, this has been documented for some people though. It's dangerous as I find out that you beat off. Like if you found out the Colin Powell was an obsessive like foot fetish. It would change the way I thought about him. That's his move. He loved like watching a video. Very specific. One girl's licking your balls while the other one you're coming on our feet right now. That would change the way I thought about him and I would question his ability to lead the military style even though it's irrational for me to think that. Yeah. If you found out that he was really into transgender porn, that was his big thing. You would. You would not trust them when it comes to decision making. Yeah, because I mean meanwhile there's no other indications. He's exactly the same person as when he was like the most awesome general ever.

Speaker 4:          01:40:10       His resumes the exact same. Just find all this training. Porn shaped. What if it gets out to the news? People find out how we enjoy this pleasure. Was that slice of pain trans transgender with a girl. It's pretty sweet. Um, what does that mean girl to a boy, meaning like a girl that has like boobs and hectic but it dick and it's fucking a normal girl that's hot you that, you watch that, watch that because it's like you take the guy who you don't really want to see anyways and you give them boobs and make them look like a girl. It doesn't affect Brian's reputation when he says something like that. It doesn't have a reputation. Reputation is that. That's the best aspect of his personality, his curiosity and his willingness to hang his neck out there, but we don't want them leaving

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       the military at the same time. It's like instead of having to look at a hairy dude or some ugly dude. No, I see your logic. Have you tried it? No, it doesn't work with me. I limit myself to a, to. I don't want to watch that. I'm scared. I'll like it because then it'll be all I watch and now I'm Colin Powell. I think personally when you start getting into weird freaky shit, like if you're only into like someone coming on feet or something like that, you need to stop beating off for a couple months. Like maybe you've talked yourself into some weird box where every girl has to have a dick and you know everybody's feed up to have red nails, just no fucking red nail Polish. You'll fight your search message boards for the Red Nail Polish fetish jerking off forum and everyone agrees with these assholes.

Speaker 1:          01:41:41       Black Goth toads who wants to see that and you find the red nail Polish, but still not good enough. You've got to find the perfect. There's always gonna be people to take anything, whether it's a conversation, whether it's a relationship or whether it's star trek and take things to a bad place. They take a good thing and they put it in a bad place. That's why porn gets such a God damn terrible reputation is because. Yeah, there is a few dudes who beat off a wee bit. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, me too much, but there's also people that use it so that you don't have to date people. They don't really want to date just to get some sex. They just see it and they, you know, they didn't create it. They don't feel totally responsible for just watching it and downloading it and then they beat off and then they go about their day full charge being trapped like poor Dick Van Dyke, Dick Van Dyke who had to sleep in a different bed, wasn't allowed to beat off them, couldn't even go fishing back then.

Speaker 1:          01:42:35       They thought Satan would come and steal you and your sleep if you beat off. Yeah, they did. They didn't know how it got labeled a homosexual thing. Beat off and be masturbating. Beat off and be gay. Well, it should be. I mean, you're a man fucking a man. You have a dick in your hand. What are you doing? You're doing gay shit. You're fucking a man's hand up there. You. Oh, I quit fucking Weirdo. Weirdo. Fucking your own. I don't believe in gay sex except my own hand. My both my hands are gay as fuck. Yeah, I right to way more guy left hands gay and my right hand's getting. Fortunately they're only gay from my Dick. Monogamous lucked out on that one. Not there's anything wrong with being gay, but it seems like you guys carried more weight than we do. We carry, carry a greater societal burden. Wouldn't not from people like me but from people who judge. Yup. So in that case, I'm glad my Dick is the only thing that my hands are attracted to. You have less to deal with. Gay Hands are called Jazz hands, right? No jazz hands. Trying to put a little extra energy and something that really sucks.

Speaker 1:          01:43:42       You know, something that's really not that good or you're trying to downplay something that is unbelievably super awesome data. Like if you're standing there in front of a movie waiting for three years and you have the opening night tickets, those are legit jazz hands. You know when you're waiting for the hobbit. Desolation of smoke to come out waiting in line. Do you remember when the fucking Harry Potter novels were coming out and people were making videos of them running by and giving away the ending? Oh, no, no, no, no. Yeah, God, those guys were cons. It would have been great if the video ended with somebody just full line citing the guy on the bike just knocking them down, kicking his ass and all the fucking Harry Potter dorks join in.

Speaker 1:          01:44:27       It was funny. Beaten with brooms. Imagine man. Just wanting to steal joy is one, a steel mystery from people. There's always somebody and that was bad. I mean, you know, I guess the Internet was still around then. I don't know what kind of spoilers you would get because social media wasn't as strong like twitter and facebook and all that stuff, so I bet it was probably harder to find out accidentally with the end of a book was you had to search for a spoiler. Yeah. Basically back then you got to really go looking or you had to get stuck next to some asshole who won't stop talking about it and you're like, I don't want to know. No, it doesn't matter. You're still enjoy it. Listen, he goes into the like, why are you still telling me this?

Speaker 4:          01:45:09       I've been working all week and when I'm done, I want to watch Harry Potter. God

Speaker 1:          01:45:12       damaged. I had a guy do that to me. Once I got that I really respected and was so brutal. I couldn't believe my opinion of him changed. So I always use a famous guy. He's telling me this really fucking boring version of that. Um, what is the, the, the. I drink your milkshake moving. Oh, there will be blood. There will be blood. Yeah. And he's telling me about the opening scene.

Speaker 4:          01:45:34       He's describing the scene. I'm like, please stop. Please stop. Please stop. I'm going to see this movie. It doesn't matter. So you still enjoy it. I still enjoy. I'll feel it. Enjoy it. You're telling me what's happening and he wouldn't stop. I literally had to walk away. I go, Jesus fucking Christ. And I had A. I had to leave. He was insisting on letting, not just me, but other people around me know exactly what happened in this opening scene. I'm like, fucking quizzes. Daniel Day Lewis was doing. Dude, I told you don't talk about me and Daniel, if I have a protein shake to think he does everything perfectly. I would never criticize him. Have you guys seen those pants that the young kids are wearing nowadays that looks like these young kids? Kids. It's where it looks like you have like poopy drawers almost. Where it's like it's not droopy pants here.

Speaker 4:          01:46:21       Here's a video like fever, like wearing them where it almost looks like, like the crutches down way far like by your knees and it almost. Oh, hold on. Like hammering and almost looks kind of like hammer pants. What? This. Okay. So they're skinny, but bagging the crotch. Like the crotch goes down to you about your knees. You look like kind of like a penguin or you better not be checking leg kicks. Tell you that and see how the pot book that's coming out of his van. This is from yesterday. He's getting in trouble. Exclusive. Yeah. They were like, police were telling me it can't hotbox with his van. Why is he driving in a van? Is that how he gets around? I guess so. He brings his crew with him. That's how you bring a crew. Yeah. You have to advantage when everybody traveled together.

Speaker 4:          01:47:03       He's got immense crew. You know when you're a legit super duper star, you gathering immense crew like he has. I'd love to have a crew. I think the full charge crew needs a special name, like the volts to charge heads or the. Yeah, the the volts. The amps. Amperage ever readies like that Duracell's duracell group. I've seen people wear these pants all the time and they hit me in a like a like a, like a gross out. Oh, here they are because they are. They're like hammer pants and I'm not shocked this shit right now. I am not shocked. Human beings are begging for the aliens to fucking wipe us out. Begging with every new fashion choice. With every new video we make. Seemed like it was getting pretty normal there for awhile. Incorrect. Full charge. Very sweat of paying attention. Fella. It's been downhill since the fucking bell bottom.

Speaker 4:          01:47:58       We accepted the bell bottom and it was a slide my friend, a slide. I think I'm going to go to track suits and fanny packs. I'll do it. I think I'm going to commit. I'm for the tracks. One track suit and fanny pack is my new look for life. I think my body will appreciate it. It's very light and relaxing. Let's find some good tracksuits Brian, and change that to our new wardrobe. Show you what? The ones that I want to live in California. Man. I don't need to wear thermals and shit. I don't need layers of goose down. I can get by with a track suit and a fanny pack. I want to be part. I want to be part of your crew. I don't feel like it started my own tracks. What kind of sneakers should we were? We definitely got to wear pumas or Adidas, whatever, whatever the whatever the track suit is.

Speaker 4:          01:48:40       Here's the shoes. That was a six dozer. Good. That's good. That's a good choice. That's a comfortable shoe to. Yep, and if you're wearing like a blue track suit with some white stripes, that'll fit nicely. If we learned anything from fat James, it's track suits and a six. No doubt about it. Rest in peace. Fred James. Yeah, track suits and a six. I haven't had a track suit since I was probably 19. Was the last time you had an actual legit tracks? I got one when I was like 28 because one of the. I was going out with this girl. I wanted to try to pull it off like we're talking about now. Yeah, she worked at a echo, you know that, that Mark Echo that clothing line. She worked there and I'm like, give me one of these tracksuits. And I tried it for like a week and I just couldn't keep it up, you know, track suit. I couldn't commit, couldn't put it that way. I didn't have a crew. Yeah. These weren't ready yet to get to have some other venue that also work so everybody doesn't give a fuck together, you know, because it's just you on your own out there in the wilderness of life, being judged by your fashion choices where to fucking tracksuit. And you see a girl outside of a place where a girl, if you were dressed like this, you'd be like, Oh, oh, your mat, full tron, stand up comedian. But she sees

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       you and while you're wearing a track suit, just like being casual, and I like dressing like a moron is that they don't buy that anymore or they don't buy it. Is it a moral thing or is it a comfortable thing? Are we the morons full charge? I know I'm the moron with our zippers to get our dicks trapped in our belts when we could just have a simple drawstring, easy access. We got to start smoking cigars to to let's do it. So little, little back, little bit of organized crime. Bruce Lee, Bruce Lee owned that type of track suit. The same way Hitler on the mustache. You can't wear that without people thinking that you bruce. I said Bruce, many more people than I see like this one. Nothing. You could wear that no problem. But that game of death one, now Bruce Lee owns that. That's, that's his. You can't wear that. You can't wear a yellow jumpsuit. It'd be embarrassing to wear a jumpsuit and like a break dance competition breaks out and then you got nothing. You get nothing. You're just kind of inching away quietly.

Speaker 1:          01:50:46       Bruce Lee, that, that yellow track suit. If you wear that, people go, Yo, what's up bruce? They'll immediately go to that. That tracks who is off limits. If you have a track suit, you better learn a skill and that had better be karate, breakdancing or account numbers and now that I'm thinking about it, is there one actor more synonymous with a very specific type of jumpsuit? Then Bruce Lee? No, I mean unless you count ll cool j, which you can't, but they can't because he owned that yellow jumpsuit and the game of their eyes so hard that to this day, the only time you see people wearing them is when they're wearing it for a bruce Lee costume. Right? A key owns that fucking yellow jumpsuit. There's never been a time like that where someone has just a really standard type of athletic apparel that is so common to them that when you see it, all you think about is them fanny pack.

Speaker 1:          01:51:36       Hey, a fanny pack, when you have an ass like that, no one sees anything other than your ass. That fanny pack is only examined by people online. If you were there in front of her, it would be like a mirage. You wouldn't be able to sit and you'd see her hips to asset ratio is incredible. I think that it's a real. She's ridiculous. Ridiculously hot. I forget what we're talking about now. Jack Nicholson, burt reynolds was burt rental truck. It was. When you see a guy like burt reynolds that's like had all that plastic surgery and really hurting right now. No one's won the plastic surgery game yet. Have they? Well, here's what's really crazy. You know, it was the same age as him, so investors, stallone [inaudible] that crazy. Fuck. That looks like he's 30 years old, right? I mean its face doesn't it? But his body is ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          01:52:30       He's fucking shredded. What Sylvester do and just hair dye. I mean he's definitely doing that. He's eating babies but to sylvester have any plastic surgery hormones. Yeah, I'm sure he has. He said he's an actor the most. By the time they get to be like that age, especially with superstar blockbuster type dudes that keep the hair the same color. I've had a little bit of something done. Yeah, no, just a little tuck here. A little botox there. They get that weird shiny skin that doesn't move and when they do this it doesn't work. Right. So it's like. So then he can't even act. It's like shiny. Can't even be surprised. You know? You can be surprised you're in a movie. Somebody hired your old crazy ass. He poisoned skin. Frozen. Fucking paralyzed skin because you think that looks better. Bruce Willis kept it real. Still working.

Speaker 1:          01:53:18       Still working. Yeah. There's a lot of those guys. Right. And then stand up comedy to a lot of those guys. Like a George Carlin. Perfect example. George Carlin just kept being George Carlin through being a young guy to be in an old curmudgeon and old, like scholarly curmudgeon, breaking down the. You know, the, the funny shit about the world became stayed the same guy. Yeah. Something happened to some people though, man, where they just can't do that. If something happens to some people, they just can't accept it. They got to cut their face. Yeah. Not a lot of comics doing this. The surgery. Right. What if it became like shown on paper that duck lips like every punchline. Ten percent,

Speaker 3:          01:54:03       but it probably does

Speaker 1:          01:54:08       slips. He Does Punch Lips. I say a punchline. Lips. It does it like on purpose. Like tell joking

Speaker 3:          01:54:14       and he's got his face cut too. He's got that scar.

Speaker 1:          01:54:16       Yeah. But that scar is an accident. And you're right though, because that's car king from a laser surgery. He was trying to get as hair removed from his face and they burned his face. Bronies fucking every fucking Harry. And He shaves his face. He gets stubble like an hour later and it's all the way up to his cheeks. So you had it. He was trying to get it lasered. They boxed them. I wonder if he got paid for that. Did you get paid for that?

Speaker 3:          01:54:40       I don't know. But you might have just done it again on his eyebrows and that's why he wears the hat down like this and glasses. I hope he doesn't. He doesn't need to do that. He's brody, she didn't give them love for food eyebrows or something. Doesn't really laser lasered eyebrows and the they physically much. It's something that lasts up to like, I think he said six months or something like

Speaker 1:          01:55:02       lasered. Yeah. Well the laser, it, it, it'll, it'll kill like a lot of your eyebrow hairs for a long time. Like a lot of girls get on there. I go down, the Hoo Ha and they get it lasered down. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:55:13       It gets a tattoo though. It's not permanent tattoo, but it's when it goes away in like six months. What are you talking about? He has eyebrows tattooed. That's why I shouldn't be talking about why while you're talking about that. We talked about on an ice house cause he already talked to you yet.

Speaker 1:          01:55:27       He's so crazy. He would. The hair chronicles. He was fucking unbelievably funny. The last time he was on here. Everybody's talking about it. Then one of the funniest podcast I've ever done with him without a doubt. So cool. He's got the TV show because he like. I

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       don't know if you remember, like when he showed up in La in the late nineties, everyone was going fucking ape shit for him. Like on the, on the comic circuit. Well, I know comics have always respected him. He's always been a guy that we stan hope and I had him to the opening warmup stuff.
