He grew up extremely religious and they told you when you masturbated that you were impregnating a demon. When you're doing it, some demon comes and like, she's like a round you fucking you as you're fucking your hand. Did you masturbate as anyway even knowing all this [inaudible] you ever throw up on a check? No, I did right as I was about to eat it when I was like I had girlfriends they'd sleep over and uh, I would, I would kicks in the middle of the night like, like my, my whole body would choke like a kid cause I was having a fighting drink.
