Speaker 1:          00:00:00       I got to high four, three, two, one.

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       Mr Henneghan, you were talking in the background. Yeah. Brian Hennigan is. He's worried about the link he's waiting for. Oh, Joe Rogan.live. Yeah. I should tweet it right. I didn't. That tweet tweet. Tweet it while I'm talking to you. Douglas. Dan. Hope the mayor of Fizz B. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:00:22       You're becoming the mayor of La. That should be your thing, man. Three hundred square miles of studio space. A twitter. I knew when I pulled up. What will you. What the Uber dropped us at the wrong place, but then we walked a few buildings down and I saw a pickup truck loading epsom salt into a side door. I go, yeah, that's flotation tank shit right there. We get the right door. Yeah, that's exactly what it is. Going live with Douglas. I only did a flotation tank once for a shoot at your house for the man show and you had the one in the house and we were doing it for a shoot so you can't really sit back and enjoy it, but for that 30 seconds they shut the door until they go, uh, action. You're like, wow, this is fucking weird. It's fucking weird. It's weird. And it never stops being weird.

Speaker 2:          00:01:14       Like even though I've done it, I don't know how many times, every time I do it, it's fucking weird. It just, it's a very strange feeling and you could shut it off anytime you want. That's the best part about it. Like I love the fact that I could just get out of it. Like if I, if you want to do shrooms or something like that, that's a commitment. I mean, you're in, you're in six, eight hours. You don't know where you're going or who's going to call or stop by. Yeah. You can't, that you, you're not shaking that you're just not going to get you. I tweeted it. Got It. All right. Beautiful. Um, yeah, but the tank you just get out. It's awesome. Just open the door. It's over. I'm sure there's some kind of upkeep that's necessary that I wouldn't do and I'd forget and I'd go on the road and I come back and there's bushes growing in there.

Speaker 2:          00:02:00       And you know what you should do. You should start a tank center in Brisbane. If nobody has money in business, you don't, it doesn't have to cost a lot of money. You get like one or two tanks and you just rent them out all day long. Yeah, it's a, again, it's like people have a disability is the biggest form of income there. I bet insurance will pay for it. Maybe I made that up. You should probably check. Um, I think that they'll. Well, I think it's a form of therapy for sure. The point is I'm not good at upkeep. I know you don't have to have above ground pool that is just nothing but algae for eight months out of the year. Dude, I moved into a house once in Encino and uh, nobody had lived in it for I guess like over a year. And they didn't do anything with the pool and the pool would become this green pond and there was schools of mosquito larva swimming around in the pool.

Speaker 2:          00:02:57       Like I was like, why in the fuck that? Like you could see them. It was the weirdest thing, man. That's a problem with getting rid of the fucking thing. Dude. It was a real problem. Like I was looking. I was like, you've got like a big stew of life out here. There are so many mosquitoes. Who was crazy? There were like little schools of fish. I was like, this is madness. All these little things are blood sucking. Little Vampires. They're going to fly around and find things to bite at. Where I live, there's no other body of water for 100 miles other than my above ground. Crazy. Those little cons, you can't kill them off. They just find a way to just breed and like back east, they're way worse now. They're way worse than they are here. It's something about the weather out here, I guess that keeps them in check.

Speaker 2:          00:03:43       The worst by far is Alaska that I've experienced. Have you ever experienced. Totally shit man, you get out of the car and they just swarm you like huge, huge and super aggressive and they only live to be like three months old, so when they're going for it, they're just fucking going for it. It's like some Wolf Shit. It's like survival of the fittest with, but it's the weirdest thing ever. They're like, they're a different thing. Like we have an idea on mosquitoes. Yeah. They're annoying to get cheese slab. Oh No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is a swarm is there's hundreds of them in your face and your eyes all over your mouth. Everywhere. Instantly. Yeah. We have no CMC. The pool was cool when we get that house. It's above ground, but it's on a slope, so there's a deck on one side, so it seems like an above ground pool because you're above the pool, but it's still an above ground pool and it's only four feet deep or something, but once monsoons hit look at that.

Speaker 2:          00:04:38       Oh my God. That's mosquitoes in Alaska. We're looking at what looks like a swarm of birds. That's the worst part about naked and afraid. If you ever watched that show is the bugs. Like I could go a month without eating. I do that anyway. I'm a drunk. I get my calories from the mixer. Are you? Do you have to stay naked? Like can you make clothes? I don't know how much they cheat. Oh No, they have made clothes. They were clothes. I don't know how much they have. The producer says, okay, you can make the beaver cloth but you can't make a full like Hoodie. They do it with every one of those shows. They'll call those shows reality shows, but there's a certain amount of like plotted out ideas and you could see them take place. You could see like the act you see acting in people. I have a whole chunk in the book that I'm here to promote, but about it's how I. I'm glued to reality just to find where they're lying. Alright. That's honestly. I like the name. Yeah. I don't know who came up with it. That's beautiful. Fuck yeah. Dude. You're an author like a legit author. How did that happen? I don't know, but you like, you've written too, like legitimate books. That's pretty fucking interesting, man. That's a different kind of person to do that. Like that's um,

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       I've always felt like an extra one on. One of the things that I love is. You actually wrote this to, you wrote, wrote this. There's no guy. Yeah. What? No, there's nothing wrong with those guys because that's probably the only way you're going to get a job, his book. Right, right. Yeah. If a guy's not going to write it right? Yeah. Get a guy, get a guy. Well, Joey Diaz could sit and tell you all their salaries. Yeah. He could tell them. Right. And if you have a guy, I'm just, I could never trust anyone to write so hard, so hard. I've talked to so many authors or writers or journalists even that they'll hand in a piece and then the editor tweaks and changes it. And the, uh, an editor got fired from the Daily News for doing that pretty recently because the guy had attribution's and his story, the different studies and shit where, where, where he got the information that was in the whatever the version.

Speaker 3:          00:06:49       And then he got accused of plagiarism when he has the original document that he sent to the publisher. So the editor was the plagiarist. The editor just decides we don't need to tell people about that. They made a weird judgment call and they removed the references, know interviews, how often they fuck up what you said. Like I remember I was the winner of the Montreal Comedy Festival. Like there's no winner in 1997. No one wins. Yeah. They don't understand what that means. But it. Yeah, if you, if you read, which I don't on purpose now you read an interview. You did. I didn't say that. Now you're making me look like a dick. And other comics are going to see this interview. And I didn't say it like that. You're like the only guy that ever won a comedy competition that people don't hate, you know, because you want San Francisco.

Speaker 3:          00:07:39       Like everybody that was after that was done. Like there was. It wasn't a big deal and it wasn't a hook, but we were both completely unknown at that point. But still, you weren't unknown in the comedy world, but they'll put up the mission itself in the late seventies. Eighties was a huge deal. That's when Robin Williams and Ellen degenerate. By the time I did it, it was me and an unknown. Dane Cook Bryant. I think competitions are fucking weird when it comes to comedy. Like that's a change in what it is. I like the festival idea festivals. Nice. We don't have to make it fucking star search or whatever. What are, you know America's got talent. It's, it's, it's a show. That's what the country wants to compete. But here's what it did. Introduce a lot of people, like when they started doing the standup show the fuck it is.

Speaker 3:          00:08:30       This comic standing last comic standing was the introduction of a lot of people got to a lot of good comics. You know, I mean that's how people found out about them. Yeah. But as long as you know going in that this is rigged. Yeah. When you're dealing with. I just did a seattle. I played up there while the Seattle competition was going on and a girl I know was in it and I had to know you first of all, play to yourself. The judges are going to be people like fucking morning show, hack a sports talk, Dj, whoever they can get. It's not real. Just do your best if it makes you work. That's why I liked him back in the day because it made me work. It made brevity important. I have seven minutes. Cut out the dead weight in this joke. Get hit your fucking beats and.

Speaker 3:          00:09:20       But I knew that it's bullshit, you know? Yeah man, it's, I'm, I'm sure I won because I was way cooler than Dane Cook. And I hung out and drank. Drank with the fucking producers. And what, wait a minute. Why would you say that? I mean, wouldn't you just win cause you did a great job. Really funny. Human beings aren't. Oh, utilizable what? San Francisco, aren't they a little bit more open minded and intelligent than the rest of the country where the people that hired the judges, that producer, I forget her name, that I hung out with the whole three weeks and we'd drink and have fun and it probably helped, but they appreciated you. Before that I was the judge a year or two later when I want to keep being self deprecating with James Inman. One, I was a judge Acadians. It bothers me when James Edmond one. I was a judge and he's still a good comic. He's a funny guy, eh?

Speaker 3:          00:10:14       I see. It's funny, but hey look, my point is last comic standing. Let a lot of people know Lonzo Bowden, you know, I'm half round was the first year he lost a Dat Phan, which I said on twitter is what killed him. He couldn't get over the shame even 20 years later or 15 is that fans still around? I've looked them up. Uh, every here and again. You remember Dat Phan and you search to see and those occasionally he'd be playing a casino. He was a guy that I felt like there's some really unbalanced hatred towards. It was very odd when he won last comic standing, people were really mad. There was a certain percentage of comics that were really mad and let me tell you something. I was there when he had a set and he fucking killed. He fucking killed whether or not you like that kind of material or not.

Speaker 3:          00:11:06       There was like he got up a bunch of hatred. Was wasn't just. He wasn't a young guy like, wow, what was it, Craig? Because Eliza one last comic standing when she was like three years in. Right. I think she said that she didn't. She said that three or four years in. I hope I don't say the wrong years, but I mean that's kind of the same thing along the same lines, right? Like you're getting in, but if you do it, you do it. Sure. You, when you've got eight minutes to kill, you can break it up and for whatever reason, man, people are so pissed at him because he was kind of fresh to comedy, right? Like he hadn't been ridiculous. He was one of those scientists that you hate. He sat down and he grabbed the laughs per minute. He's getting based on his recordings of his sets and really did that on last comic standing.

Speaker 3:          00:11:51       He'd have these graphs of laughs. That's interesting. Why do I hate that? I don't know. We were talking about this on a podcast yesterday where like the all the people that you were trained to hate. We're talking about like carrot top and the nineties. You hated carrot top as a comedian. You kinda had to hate him. And then he beat Bill Hicks for some comedy award back when they had comedy awards. Uh, what's also the prop thing, for whatever reason, a prop comic is a lesser man, right? But he's essentially, he's the last guy that's going to interfere with us. He no one's flipping a coin between carrot top and Joe Rogan. Well, yeah. And, but I think there's enough to go around even if they were like this shit, but I'm saying all that hatred. And we were talking about Dennis Leary, who I listened to on stern and I really loved the interview and I liked Denis leary and I realized it was just all that he stole Bill Hicks Persona thing, that I just hated him for that.

Speaker 3:          00:12:52       And you get old and you go, I don't really give a shit. Yeah. And when do you let it go? Yeah, Wendy let it go when we're old and go, fuck yeah. We were joking around before the show about how to send off an email and he's probably talking to someone on twitter or no, fuck your mother, like you imagine in that guy is still doing that all the time. Like God damn thatall right? I talked to Owen Benjamin and he's like, dude, sometimes I don't sleep. I'm like, listen to me man. You've got to stop doing that because Owen will fucking go to war on twitter all day. And Jamie Kilstein, Jamie Kilstein was on and he was pretty open about how he would be when he was all social justice, Warrior it out. He would get crazy with his phone and these arguments where he couldn't think of anything, but he was constantly pulling his phone out, checking and what did they say?

Speaker 3:          00:13:40       What they say, well, fuck them. You fucking cisgender piece of shit or whatever the fuck you get mad with it. You get obsessed. I just say, don't do it folks. Avoid arguments in real life, especially when you're arguing down. You might be, you know, you might be like going to war with someone who's on your own level. Yeah, I'd argue on A. There's a couple of recent things were friends of mine are arguing. You know that you look like a fucking open mic or when you, when you have these arguments in business with people who are far your underlings. Well it's just. I mean I just really feel like we should try for meaningful discussion with friendly people and just figure out what the fuck we disagree on, but that's where I get trapped is I'm the guy that when the Jehovah's witness comes to my door, you start to find them the mood I'm going to, I'm going to prove them wrong. And the less sense they make, the harder that fucking wood is to knock on how you store. They used to be my thing. I would always want to argue with people about. Especially about like if someone

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       had had some ridiculous religious belief, I would always argue with them about it. And now I don't. I don't care. Like as long as I'm nice, I think it's. I think it helps a lot of people I really do and it. And even if they're not right, here's the thing, if you live like it's true, it is right while you're alive, if you live like it's true. Like we look at it like almost from two dimensions when there's like multiple dimensions to the idea of religion. Because even though it probably, there was never a time where a guy came back from the dead. There's probably never a time where a guy walked on water. But if you buy the idea of this person and this person's goal for humanity and move toward the directions, like moving towards love and compassion and treating each other as equals.

Speaker 2:          00:15:39       I mean that's like the whole Jesus thing. So even if it's it never really weird superstition, that was the catalyst to make you a decent person. Yeah, I think like all human things, he gets poisoned along the way. But the idea behind it, if even if you don't think it's true, if you treat it like it's true, it is true. Like you really will make a better world. It sounds like super hippie. No, that's twisty shit. And if you have some mental illness that makes you believe you're driving a cadillac, you're driving a fucking Cadillac, but you know how we have laws and we have certain ways that we behave and we have agreements with how we dress and the words we use, the phrases. If there was a religion that was all super positive that we just all agreed to adopt just the same way we adopt all the other things that we do in our lives.

Speaker 2:          00:16:27       All the other normal shit we do with the way we decided to dress or cars we drive. Just adopt that in there too. Like this is. This is just how we behave. We behave as this as if we are souls in a vessel created by the great one who knows everything and has a plan for us all and we should be kind to each other and move in the direction of love and harmony. I mean, that's basically what all religions. Some Cock sucker that says, oh yeah, that a great entity just spoke to me directly in my bedroom and we're going to have a different sect of religion. There's a fucking funny show on Netflix about that. The unbreakable, Kimmy Schmidt was a woman who was in a sex cult who was in the backyard, like trapped in a basement for like months with some. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:17:10       I mean, I don't know how it's yours. I think it was supposed to be. It's a really funny show though, and she gets. Have you seen it? Wait, is it a show? A show? It's a sitcom on Netflix. It's called the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. I think Tina fey is one of the people, the creative people on it. Fucking funny show man. Like really funny. Like so overdue to get caught up on Netflix binges. Oh Man. Yeah, it seems like it's been two years of just as something I gotta do I need new ones? I need to catch up on old ones. A plug. Nathan, for you. Have you watched Nathan for you on comedy central? No. What is it? Is one of the funniest fucking shows ever.

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       Completely underrated. You have to understand what it is going in. It's basically like a bar rescue, but a fake a. it's basically a hidden camera show, but open hidden camera. It's like a bar rescue kitchen nightmares, Nathan. Uh, what's the God, goddammit? Google it. Nathan something Jewish. Uh, Nathan fielder. Nathan fielder. And he's A. Yes, he does for small business. He uh, he helps small businesses. This guy, it's, he's so uncomfortable to watch. I can't do it justice. You have to watch Nathan for you. So these people with small businesses think it's a real show and they come on and he helps them with their problems and it's, it's, it's so amazingly layered in watch the one with the, uh, the guy that has the, a TV shop that can't compete with best buy and there's so many layers.

Speaker 2:          00:18:57       I put it on my phone, I trusted implicitly pleased, watch it and then tweet about it because it's fucking brilliant and I'll just embarrass it by trying to explain it. If there's anything, any prominent, how with Netflix is that sometimes I don't know what I'm looking for. You know, like there's a lot of shows that turns out like, Whoa, this is a four seasons of this and you never heard of it. Like maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm that. And it's totally possible because there's always some fucking new musical artists. And I go, who the fuck is that? And I'll go to their instagram page. They have 14 million followers. And I'm like, oh, it's me. I'm that old man. I'm that old band. Doesn't know Jack Shit. We

Speaker 4:          00:19:32       had a uber coming here. Was this old prolly Armenian guy, probably sixties racist. Triggered a start the show. He uh, he's listening to what I assume he thinks people want to listen to and it's all this shit. I couldn't name you a fucking Jz from a that kind of shit. I don't know any of it. And I'm about to say, hey, you don't have to play this for us. But then I, I saw him lip sinking to the lyrics and tapping his fingers. Oh, on the steering wheel. I'm like, wow, how out of the loop of my fucking 60 year old for an uber, Uber drivers know all the words to these fucking songs. But you never been a music guy. No, you don't like music now that's, that's something that it's not possible. I mean, I have songs I like, wait, what's a great song like Doug, Stan hope here's. He goes, oh yeah, sits back. Most of the new songs that I've, I've learned I've either heard playing in a store or on a commercial and I go, ah, that's catchy. Do you latch, chat, chat, chat, chat? I don't know that I love you.

Speaker 4:          00:20:44       Chop chop chop by a Jimmy. Yeah, it's from like 1997 was on the soundtrack of the movie go. And then they disappeared. You can't even find where the band is now, but it was on a corona commercial and I love it and I use it as intro music all the time. That pumps me up. There you go. Sing a song.

Speaker 3:          00:21:09       Well, give me some volume. See, I'm just seeing the video on

Speaker 5:          00:21:15       mute. I'm into this song. This is great. Headphones. This is great. No, no, that. I love you always. Again, I like how these gals are dressed like they're 19 fifties.

Speaker 3:          00:21:42       Cover girls. What is about that look, right? That like cover, you know, pinup girl. That's what it's called. Nineteen fifties. Pinup girl type of. Look. What is it about that feeling? Maybe it makes fat chicks look good. Doug. Stan hope. Do you not realize it was a different day and age? You can't say that anymore. Those days are done. What's wrong with a fat girl looking good? What's wrong with you? You just need to just find out what able is to meet Dave Bliss. Ablest. I'd read. I saw someone write a bus. I'm like, do I really want to go in? And they say, it's got to be a handicapable. Exactly. You're your person that doesn't get the words, but if you are mocking someone who's like literally stupid or low watt Gurgler in a high back chair. Exactly. You're, you're, you're enabling, you call people idiots. You're enabling. Yup.

Speaker 4:          00:22:41       That was my last special. I did a whole bit about, it's called the euphemism treadmill where you can't say retarded because. But retarded was the clinical term because before that they were called imbeciles and morons or they were called Mongoloid idiots. Yeah. And that's what it was for kids with downs. They kept changing it and then we kept making fun of them with the new name so they had to change the new name to something else and then we'd make fun of what the new name under the punchline to the entire long bit was, you know, if you went straight clinical definition, American Medical Association and you said, Oh uh, and you made that stick. That's what I'm going to make fun of you for. When you slip on a banana peel. Oh, you just exhibited some of the Atlanto axial instability usually associated with the trisomy 21 genetic disorder. You fucking stage funny by seven was bored with the trisomy 21. Chromosomal imbalance.

Speaker 3:          00:23:43       Yeah. There's certain things can make fun of white people. White people are failure. Fair game. You can be racist as fuck. Sure. Especially if you're a white guy. You hate white people making fun of lawyers. They last long with you because they own everything. Yeah. Lawyers are good. One to make fun of, but he can't make fun of Jews. Well, yeah. Jew is just one of those words where it's all in the inflection as to whether or not he fucking Jew. Whoa. Right. It's all been. No. You know, the Jews are a people that that's fine, but if you say Joe. Yeah. Like you say, if you say I'm all about Jews, that's okay. Yeah. I'm all about Jews. Just like hanging out with Jews. That's a only Jews. People would go there in the town like you'd be okay. That's all right. People accept that, but it feel like, God, I'm tired of all these Jews.

Speaker 3:          00:24:33       Unacceptable. Unacceptable. Y, W. I overdosed on Jews. I was just around nothing but Jews for like months and there's too many one in Armenian in my life for a few days I talked to somebody I never do sets. If I come to town and I'm hanging at the comedy store, it's to talk to you and drinking the back bar and hang out. Hey, do you want to do is set no fucking way. Do I ever want to do a set for normal people? I. I paid my fucking dues. I made my bones to have a small niche fan base that are defendable. Doug, I got news for you. Okay. I hate to do this to you again, but they're here like your fans are here. Your fans or fans or in La, they would love it if you did a set. They're like, it's not like they wouldn't go through.

Speaker 3:          00:25:20       They're like, you have a lot of fans. You fuckhead doctor with this niche group. That's horseshit. People know you're funny. I'm tired of this. I'm talking about when it's just a mixed bill of fucking love. You scatter shot this 400 people. I bet 320 of them are your fans. First of all, you know this well. You still do some shit. I saw you last time I saw you. You were doing one of those weird shows where people just called out premises, stand up on the spot and you fucking destroyed it, and you told me afterwards, none of that was planned. You had none of that in your holster. All of that was off the top of your head, which is fantastic. I was high as a kite. I barely knew what I was saying. It's for me to do material. I can't do you. Fifteen minutes. One minute.

Speaker 3:          00:26:08       Give me a mental hugs. Come into the embrace of the comedy store to stop this. Why is, why would I do it outside of my own comfort zone? Don't you aren't in your comfort zone. Your comfort zone is everywhere. If I went up on stage, if I came to town, which I rarely do, I get to see you and a million people I never see all in one room and everybody loves to see you too, but if I went on stage, then I would have this whole anxiety, well, that sucked, and then I'd be apologizing for my set. Oh, great. Set says Greg proops or someone and then you're like, it wasn't good. I forgot this tag and that tag and I rather than just hanging out and enjoying myself, so fuck it. Bucket. So here's the thing though, and this is, I'm going to say this with all sincerity, there's more understanding and camaraderie at the store right now than any place I've ever been at any time.

Speaker 3:          00:27:04       And even when we have bad sets, like people have someone have a bad set and like, how was it dude? I could not connect with those people. Like someone will say, you know, we'll be fill Arkansas. Then the comedy store, the front of my peers somewhere. No one will see it. You talk about it and you learn something from it and you. It's like it's a weird environment, but it fosters new shit. It fosters new ideas and taglines and which I was going to say about twitter battles. I got so much good material out of fighting these, whatever it was at the time, my space, twitter, facebook before that news groups and getting into these angry, ugly arguments. When I'm writing, I'm writing paragraphs in defense of and guess what? Oh I have 15 minutes because some stooge annoyed me on a dot comedy standup news group and I spent all night fighting, accidentally wrote a new act.

Speaker 3:          00:28:05       That's actually probably a good use of it if you could see you and I are very different in that regard. I would rather just not talk to those people, but if you did want to go to war, which I used to do, you can get some material out of that for sure. Because you're forcing yourself to think again anytime you forced yourself to her. Like I've found that like the best shit that I ever write. I write completely free form where I don't know, I just like, I'll, I'll, I'll just start thinking about, uh, any subject and just start writing. I'm not specifically try to write jokes and on, on the way I can like Kinda suck those jokes out of there. Do you do that? How do you. It depends on the, the, the premise, but the best premises I have, I write like a defense attorney.

Speaker 3:          00:28:49       So. And then we can look at it, login the jokes afterwards, once the justice has left the courtroom, all rise. Then you put it in the fist fuck jokes. Yeah. There's, there's a gut. It's super important to have a balance. Right. And you got to find out where that balance is. Like when you can get away with a premise, you know, you've got to stack it just right. I could just stack it the wrong way one way. And you look like you're patronizing and you're full of shit. Stack at the wrong way the other way you look like, or a sexist or a Republican and secret man. Do I have notes? The new current current climate? Yeah, I'm sure. Right? Imagine working for a television show. I wanted to bring this up. I'm glad we just got to talking about this. Sam Cedar got fired yesterday. I missed this. So can I just saw someone on twitter deal?

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       Sam Cedar, who's a heavy leftwing fellow who um, was apparently in some sort of a dispute with the alt right. I don't know what was going on. I think it was about Roy Moore. Like there's one of those things and they pulled up a tweet of his and took it out of context from 2009 and that suite was. I'm going to paraphrase it, I don't want to fuck it up. Jane. Actually Jamie, pull it up so we can find the exact

Speaker 3:          00:30:09       tweet. You know that if you paraphrase it, you're going to sound funnier than he would. It wasn't that funny road interact. If I was going to edit your act, this is how you fight it. He just actually, here's one minute ago. Here's essentially what it is. If you can't find it, you got to find it and you've got to find the. Because I don't want to fuck this up. I can't tell you how many times I've told Hennigan about now this comment, you get to see this is a great comic. They do this bit and I do the bit for them and he's like, oh, that's funny. And then he sees them. Me, Oh, you do it so much better than the other guys. Got Too many words. Too many words. He's Irish. Guilted into retarded. Distracting you with admitted premise.

Speaker 2:          00:30:56       Um, but anyway, ms NBC got a swarm of emails like the, these people like attacked, know these alt right fellows attacked and started saying that this guy had tweeted a which essentially a rape joke and that we would never sponsored you and we're going to contact your sponsors. This is what he said. You got a thing covering over the, a picture of it. Don't care. Oh, I eat. Oh, go, don't care our, he polanski. But I hope if my daughter is ever raped by an older truly talented man with a great. Oh I. But I hope if my daughter is ever raped, it is by an older truly talented man with a great sense of Nissan Nissan scenes. I don't know. That's what it is, is a, this. Here's the part, here's the part of the problem. He deleted this which he regrets doing it, but it's a part of a series of tweets.

Speaker 2:          00:31:52       All of them that criticize people support of Roman Polanski because Roman Polanski had raped kids, but he did really good films and he was like, just fucking disgusting. That is. He was essentially saying, this is a horrific way to look at this. Like this guy raped a baby, right? He raped like a 13 year old. Yeah. Right. So this was a part of a series of tweets all expressing this and that was clearly satire and MSNBC capitulated and they fired him. And uh, I, you know, I don't know him. I know people who do know him, some that like, um, you know, and it's, uh, it is not, I don't have a dog in this fight, but that's crazy. That's crazy. If you look at what this, the joke was and that the fact that he deleted it and then on top of that, the. Is he apologizing for it?

Speaker 2:          00:32:43       No, he's not. He's not. What he did was he made a video explaining what the joke was, why he said it, and the fact that it was a part of a series of tweets that he said, but it doesn't matter. Once that fucking outrage machine, I was just asked if I regret my tweet from 2009, I regret. Laziness led me to delete it. I would never regret criticizing rape apologists. And I agree with that tactic. I don't know Sam Cedar. I don't either, but I know that he could probably start a podcast and make a decent living and not have to work for someone who's going to fire him. Well, he, I think he has his own show minority report, right? Isn't that his own show? He does that. His own Internet show because that's what he loved it. Yeah. And you know, and here's the other thing, he isn't.

Speaker 2:          00:33:32       He had a dispute more than once, I believe, with my good friend Sam Harris. And he accused Sam Harris of being the name. Sounds familiar, Sam Harrison, neuroscientists. Some people don't like that term. They don't. He's an author's runs, has a podcast. He's essentially an intellectual, very, very, very smart guy. Like one of the smartest guys I ever have my podcast. So what was their beef? Sam Harris believes that all ideologies are inherently dangerous and Islam is very problematic. And many people on the left think that when you criticize Islam that you are some sort of a racist. You're akin to a racist. Whereas if you criticize Christianity here, someone was just not a rube right against that weird thing because of brown skin and people's desire to not be perceived as racist so they go way overboard with it and which is what's happening with the me too thing where you go, I see all the benefits of people coming out and it's putting the fear in a fucking.

Speaker 2:          00:34:29       Everybody who let me die, fuck 20 years ago. Exactly. No, but I just wanted to just for Sam Sake, like he's not a racist by any stretch of the imagination. He doesn't like ideologies. He doesn't like something that makes you think that God wants you to kill people. He doesn't want. I mean, whether or not you interpret that the way the Christians do. I mean there's not a lot of people killing people over some shit from the Old Testament. You know, there's no one out there in the acting the rate the rates of God for people wearing two different types of cloth. Right. Because Christians are generally better off and yeah, once you get a lot of fucking toys and yeah. You Dismiss a lot of that. I should kill myself in the name of blank. That's a fucking good point. You know, and I've always wondered if you look at like the Middle East, you're not looking at like rushed, lush tropical forests and beautiful beaches like Brazil. You know where everybody's happy and they want to play fucking volleyball on the beach. Do Jujitsu. Everybody's having a party. No, it's not the Saudi princes, they will still wear the garb, but then once they get behind the gold plated palace doors. Yeah, there's dixit swinging and fucking champagne flowing, but outside it's all sand for people

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       that have nothing better. That's why Jesus works in the Mideast Midwest where you're in fucking Indiana and you have fields to plow and it's gonna be Shitty, great. Angry whether, and maybe Jesus is the only thing getting you through another year, another harvest and you put a marble on the highway and it just sits there. It doesn't keep rolling. There's no hills bitch. Snow hits the fucking worst. Indiana is the worst state in the country, but even in Indiana they found gold and it became like Qatar. Some shit. They just, you know, they found oil, they felt like some crazy new patch oil and all of a sudden they started building the world's tallest building there and the same kind of shit they do in Dubai. We do buy apparently is insane now. They have indoor surfing things in Dubai in the middle. Did you get a surfboard and your indoor surfing?

Speaker 3:          00:36:32       You could ski in doors. They've indoor skiing in Dubai and you're going to have that here in the compound. Do you have a name for this new uh, towns and it's kind of worn. Yeah. Plus I think Anthony Kumi, Anthony Kumina, who I have to give him his props to. He's probably the reason why I started a podcast. It was, first of all, because he was a part of opiod anthony, which was the first time I ever thought like, I really liked doing radio or the way opie and Anthony did it. It was great. We would come in. You, you have done it too, right? Yeah. But I remember first doing it going, wow, am I the shitty episode? Because no one really talked a lot. We just had fun. I know I, it took me a minute to, oh, they just decided to do what they wanted to do with radio.

Speaker 3:          00:37:15       I just thought I was boring because there's no bells and whistles and fake laughs and to this day I don't think opie and Anthony got the credit that it deserved because I think that they let us, they let us like they're the best show. They were the best show ever. They don't exist anymore, unfortunately, but they were the best show ever to go on today exist in their own world? They do. I know Anthony does and he still has. This was recently fired. I don't, I don't know what I just know. He started his own thing. Norton's still doing his thing with Sam Norton this still doing this thing with Sam and Norton does a thing with the UFC too. He does UFC uncensored with Matt Serra, which is hilarious. And Norton also does the chip chip person podcasts. He does all that on his own now. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:37:57       I've never listened to it, but I've been tweeted about it enough to know that it's a character. It's hilarious. It's so uncomfortable. It's so good. It's one of my favorite things that he does. It's fucking amazing. You want to see a video of it right now we're in a live broadcast. No, but I'll pull it up sometimes. I hated making people listen to 30 seconds of Chacho. It was good. I liked it. Good. Let people know. A lot of people don't know. There's a lot of shit people don't know. You know, there's only one way to find out. Someone has to tell you. I find out from commercials that a little help at work, you know? I know coronas still sucks as beer, but I liked the song that you use. Thank you, dear you. Are they a sponsor to corona with a lime feminine?

Speaker 3:          00:38:41       Some tropical climate and I want a beer, but I don't really want a beer. Yeah, that's. I want a soda, but I want to stay drunk. You know what a Moscow mule is? Yeah. What is that? It's some drink, but they, uh, there was a surplus of copper at the time. So the guy in order to get rid of copper said, oh, you have to drink it out of a copper cup, and it was just a big room and now copper and it's going to be in a copper cup and I don't know how they did that with corona and alive. Oh No. You put a lime in this beer. Yeah, that's true. Right? Why does it have a lime? And every now and then someone sticks alignment at Dos equis and you're like, what? What is this? What is this? Wow. You've become judgmental drinking years.

Speaker 3:          00:39:21       Yeah, I'll get weird. You know, get weird when it comes to drinks. But Corona is not a bad beer. It's just not a strong beer. It's fine. When I'm in a place that's dark, I like to drink real shit. I like to drink like an IPA or Guinness or Jack Daniels. That's what I like to drink in a darkened. I like a dark wood environment. This is Shitty neon lights. This. Your studio is a great dark. This is a bar they I would go to. I would go dark hardwood bar. It's a little bright. I'd be like, it's kind of annoying in this place. It's like if the cameras weren't on drinking, this is no. If you came out of that bright sunlight. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. This would be common into this he brick, especially if it's hot outside, which by the way it might get hot here any minute now.

Speaker 3:          00:40:12       There is a fucking fire in Ventura and the winds are insane right now in the fire. V Through Ventura is just tearing things apart. Got The alert on my phone and the Uber drive over. Be careful warning warning's bad man. I mean it is bad and it scares the shit out of me because I left a kid somewhere. Yes, there's that for sure. Um, but what it scares the shit out of me is that in the short term, I think most people are going to get out of there if they prepare and move accordingly. But you gotta you gotta realize what this is like. This is something that when you get a fire of this size, it's burned back that up a little bit. So you get the numbers just in today is burned 45,000 acres destroyed at least 150 structures, force 20,000 people, 27,000 people to evacuate and they can't stop it. They don't have enough manpower. When when something is this big and it's this strong and the winds are this fucking crazy. You look at how those trees are blown over sideways and these fucking houses are up in flames and it's how do they even have enough water? I have no idea. I Live City Hall just burned down the city hall building and just them putting the fire out. Everyone's water went out. It was not enough water. You couldn't turn on your taps because they used it all to put out city all. I wonder

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       if there's like a chart where you could see where you could go back to nine slash 11 and post nine slash 11. How many women got impregnated by firefighters? Like how many? Remember when firefighters, like after nine slash 11, remember they were real heroes. People have kind of like taking them for granted until they do something to actually save your house.

Speaker 4:          00:41:51       I used to do that bit about after nine slash 11 firefighters and cops are getting so much hero pussy. They were launching it like a rotted doctopus out of, out of, what do you call those? Slingshots slingshots. They'd have to swat him down with tennis rackets. I had this whole bit about Europe was so true, right? Yeah. No, not. Well then the war came and then all the, I think the bit was all the troops are getting the hero pussy that nine slash 11 first responders used to get and now they're just hanging around bars. Go remember me?

Speaker 2:          00:42:26       Yeah man. Do you know Google has this crazy thing on his phone when I was paying attention to recently where you, um, you say something like, hello, my name is Doug Stanhope. And then it translates it out loud to someone else. Like through your phone, they talk to your phone and they'll say, you know, may Abolo Pedro. I am, I, they go through the thing. It translates it and then it changes it in your ear to what English is the English version of that apple fish. What's it called? Babel fish was on the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. Oh, okay. So apple fish as a fish. I saw this. It's a new feature on this phone call, the Google Pixel, and I said, I don't think people. And you have to have these Pixel earbuds that do it, or you can actually do it through the phone, I think without the ear buds, but I don't think people understand how crazy this is.

Speaker 2:          00:43:16       Like if they're just starting this thing out, like it used to be. You couldn't really talk to your phone. Now you could. You could do a google search by just pressing that speaker button and say who is Brian Hennigan? And then a boot put in like seconds. It'll pull up your wikipedia who doug stanhope in seconds, like what is going to. If they can do this thing right, we're going to have a thing in our ear like little earbud and you're gonna be able to talk to people all over the fucking planet. It's going to get super strange. People that speak Arabic languages, so people that in South America you're going to get.

Speaker 4:          00:43:49       I still every so many of these technological advances, I think about you and your bits back in the day. Why do they have all these things on the cell phone that replaced what a cell phone is? Yeah. Well, why you making me read texts me, it takes me four buttons to make an act and ask. Call me. Just call me.

Speaker 2:          00:44:13       Back then. I would've never thought that text messaging would become popular. That there's a bit that you could never do today. I could only do that bit in 2005. When it was like people were starting to send you text messages like without fuck is this. You would get on your phone. You'd go, why don't you just call me stupid? Why are you making me reply with my thumb? Well, that's

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       awkward. Shows how much you don't really want to talk to your friends. I don't want to have to say, hey, how you been? What's going on? How's the kids? How's your sister? Yeah. I just need one simple response. I respect Joey Diaz for that. Joey Diaz will not do that with you and I think he's right. I'm thinking about it more and more lately. Have these weird text message conversations with the people. I'm like, why am I doing this? I need to look at you. You need to know. I like you like the friends. If we're going to socialize, don't text me. Hey, how's it going? That's a bar conversation. You can see me in a bar. I don't want to sit and catch up via text. Hey, how about that one in a long time? Hey, have I just. Hey. Yeah. Hey, fuck. Is this? What? Are you 12?

Speaker 3:          00:45:18       You can't get my phone. Kids got my phone number. Motherfucker. What's going on? Hey, see me in a bar and then sit down and say, Hey, 12 what? Hey. Hi. You can say that to your friend. Like, Hey, hey. Yeah. Yeah, but usually that's the extent of what I have to say. Anyway. Got It. All right. High Five, high five on text, but you'd probably have a, an Emoji. Can't hey on text and you definitely can't do. You can't yo you lazy. Fuck you want to talk? You ain't got shit to say. Yo. I need affirmation that we're still friends, just, you know, it's kind of part of the business. We're not going to be close friends over a quarter of a century just because of text messaging. I don't live in your town. You're going to lose Brownie points if you just type Yo. You're going to have to have like, Yo, are we still having lunch?

Speaker 3:          00:46:12       Yo, are we going to the game? Like I texted you a week ago. Hey, what time are we doing that podcast? Because he's supposed to set up other shit around it, but then I said in parentheses that I don't want to do, so I'm glad you didn't get back to me. I'm so glad I helped you. Yes you did. We going to procrastinate broken. I go Rogan's podcast or like nine hours and we're not going to be able to fit other ones in. It's unfortunate, but what is fortunate it is. This is not famous available right now. Ladies and gentlemen, Joe Rogan stories are in there. Oh beautiful. It has an index. I do have. I have a lot of fucking name drops in there. We had some good times, you know that the story that we were talking about in question you have to read about in the book, but it involves Doug, Stan hope and I in the desert that Dale. I'm sure we've talked about it. I know we have too many times. Then afterwards go into that Lakers game few days later. Yeah. That was a weird one, right? Yeah. In the height of nine slash 11 patriotic fever and was like, this is nuts. You guys are going crazy. Like you're standing up for a basketball game. This is. I remember when you picked me up at curse on for that game. You add a, I don't know, an suv of some kind of. It's probably a suburban. Was pissing off in Denali.

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       You've got a white Yukon Denali and you were pissing out the door while we were high on mushrooms going 65 miles an hour down the highway deaths door open and he's like pissing out the door. Probably Piss all over my truck, but this is as the wars kicking off. Two thousand three, I believe. We saw the war. We saw the war kickoff. I'm like, it was the superbowl like it was planned. I spell all this out and you will. You said it. I remember you said it. You said, oh my God, there's a kickoff. We were ahead of the curve. Joe Rogan was with technology because when you pick me up in that, that's the first time I heard gps say in 400 feet. Take a right onto the one. Oh one. And also you had cell phone video because you videotaped me pissing out your door.

Speaker 2:          00:48:18       Just 2003. It was 2003. You know the best picture I ever took on my cell phone. This is like affirmed the need to have a camera on you at all times. I was in downtown La and there was this overweight black hooker with a crazy wig on and sunglasses and she was eating a meatball sub and I looked over and she goes, hey baby. And she pulls her tit out and she's got her tit and one hand and I took a picture of this. See if you can find that. It's. I know it's out there. I know it's out there. I couldn't. It's, it looks so amazing. I couldn't, I couldn't believe it, and I took it with one of those Motorola flip phones back in 2000 because we were filming fear factor downtown La and this lady was walking around with their tear out.

Speaker 2:          00:48:59       I was like, this is a lawyer. She was smiling and laughing and I took a picture of her with her tit out and uh, to me to this day is like, now I know. Why wouldn't want to know that you're taking a picture. Nobody knew anything. Nobody knew anything. It was like to, to think that just a few years later the iphone will come out, you know, 2007. The iphone comes out and now you can't imagine anybody not have one of everything. If you, if you, if you're around someone and they don't have a smartphone, you look at it like there's some kind of freak. Becker is the only one that becker my oldest best friend from forever still doesn't have a cell phone. Yeah. My friend Steve doesn't have a phone. His wife fucking hates state. It is. That's the picture. That's a real picture. Please take a screenshot of that and save it for me because I keep losing it.

Speaker 2:          00:49:46       Why do you say that? So happy, but come on son. Look at that picture. She's enormous. She's got a meatball sub in her hand. It's the perfect picture. Jamie, I want you to order up a large hd version of this. Have some scientists convert that we're gonna. Make a poster out of that. That needs to be on the wall. One hundred percent. Put it on. You know, don't put it on Youtube, but that's got to remind me of this. Get the crew on it. We need to have that photo on our wall. That's my one of my happiest moments. I swear to God. I went back to work. I was fucking howled and laughing because I had a lady was funny. She looked at me, Oh, you want some of this?

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       And she pulled the content out and then she smiles and starts laughing at me. All the while she's eating a meatball sub. That's a great picture. Palming that sub like it's a a 45 and a old west shootout and God helped her tit the way she's got a death grip on that ticket. I was like, she gets some sort of a cobra choke. That's. Yeah, that's, that's how I have to choke my dick to keep it up when I'm drunk. You get almost like your whole cock ring queue. Like you get it, like you're making a bridge pinching down on your dick a hard fight. The boobs fight. The Bose Mr. Penis. Yeah. That's a great picture though. That's an important moment for me because I'm like, okay, now I know I'm into this stuff. It was so I could capture that picture. I was happy for days because I remember looking at it go and that's real. Like I always see those. You see those crazy pictures online, you know who took that, what happened? But I took that. I was there. I like that was real, like it was really. I didn't pay that lady. It was just happened to be. I said hi to her. I had my phone out and she looked at me and pulled her tit out and I hit the camera button. Then it got it. So it wasn't supposed to happen.

Speaker 3:          00:51:43       That is your sailor kissing the girl in Times Square. Thank you. Thank you, Mr Hannigan. You're right. Planting the flag at all. Accept that. I feel like it's my magnum opus Codec. Choke it. It might've been the best thing I've ever done. Needs a cocktail. I get ice right here. I don't like that. That lady is doing that for a living. I was not doing a wish her living anymore. Probably dead, but I wish our prosperity and happiness and I hope she found Jesus the next moment after I took that picture. And then. But you can't fix everybody, but sometimes you just got to let people be crazy. I remember, uh, well several people that have women of a certain age or a look or they go, yeah, but what else? What else am I going to do? I'm going to suck Dick for a living. I'm going to go out on the street and you go, you couldn't like, you know ones, but then you watch like cops or something.

Speaker 3:          00:52:41       When you see a lady like that, it's getting caught in a pickup truck. Stuck in some old dudes, Dick and you go. I guess you could. You could. She could. You could. So you could. She's empowering to women is what I'm saying. It entirely depends with the Mail on how horny you are because if your crazy horny, I've done some bad things. We'll do some terrible things. Were monsters, bad bad animals. It's a bad design. The design where you have to get rid of them all the time is terrible. Design. It would be way better. I do a lot. It's an old bit of yours that I quote a lot is you're a post come depression. Is that how it goes? A postnet depression. Yeah. That feeling that which is so like I, I really believed I liked her. Yes. Wasn't until. Oh, and as the semen as rifling out of you, you go, oh, I misled her.

Speaker 3:          00:53:40       Oh my God. I misled myself. Which that's where you get scared with the me too thing. I know I didn't rape anyone, but how many times might I have led a woman astray with promises of everlasting love and harmony just because I was drunk and wanted to fuck her and then didn't call. I was inappropriate afterwards. I didn't do the, hey, um, I don't think we're right for each other and she's stewing about it somewhere and wants are you can't meet to me. It definitely can happen like that. Right? It's like you got to leave room for all possibilities because I think that to trust everyone that comes forward with a story like you shouldn't. What? You should be open minded about all the points of view. Like I would, I'd hate to see someone get in trouble for something they didn't do because they dated a gal and she hated them and so she made up some stuff and this has happened before.

Speaker 3:          00:54:44       Oh, absolutely. People, you've got to be. Let me give you an example. Please do. How many. Maybe we should clarify because this is a touchy subject. No, I know you're not a sexist by any imagination in support of the alleged witch hunt because it is making people who are serious abusers and there's one I fucking want to out but I don't have to, but it's not going to be, you know, that it's real and then you know that people in positions of power like that to have people working under them are dependent upon them in that way. They will prey on them and do weird shit to them and they've been doing it forever because they can get away with it and that seems to be like, that seems to be how this town in a lot of ways was designed how the whole porn industry was set up.

Speaker 3:          00:55:29       But you have to. There's a willingness on both sides. Hopefully. Well, I think that there's a lot of girls that will fuck you for a part. I don't think it's that. See, that's not the thing. It's not like, um, again, there's a million. The me to encapture encapsulates a lot of different stages of sexual abuse variances from. I always like to think of it. I have a sister mother rule, especially as I've gotten older, like a thought about this for so long and I feel like you have to treat every, like if you're in any, you have to look at every situation. Like what would that be like? If I found out that happened to my mother, what would that be like if I found out that happened to my sister. I mean if you go to children then it gets really crazy and you get super psychotic and because your protective as well. Although I'm

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       very protective of my sister, you get that. You got to almost look at it like that and I don't think we get taught that enough. You know? I think it takes us a long time of living as an adult to sort of figure out like who's the Dick here? Is it me or is it them? Or is it my making bad choices? Am I arguing with people and getting these weird relationships with people that I really don't belong with in the first place. Maybe I need to figure out who the fuck I am before I do this. Like there's all these different things that happen in a relationship and a lot of times along the way people get into some know, some weird spaces in their life, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:56:58       man show the secretary that we had, you weren't around for a lot of it because you were doing. Unfortunately I work 14 hours a day. Then man, shelf for four hours. They need to do an hour at the comedy store for 30 minutes about her. But no, we didn't know what you gonna sell it. I'm just like the amount that we abused or on what we would think is a comedy level. Me and Andy, not you, you weren't there, but do it back to you guys too. But if it was on paper, but if she had a change of heart right now and said, oh, I want to be part of the me too thing and here's my story because I want to be noticed. You can't do it to me because I'm not famous fortunately.

Speaker 2:          00:57:42       Do you think this is one of those like swing one way and then swing back and normalize things or do you think that this. But I think it might be, but as time goes on, I wonder if I just, this is, and this is not, is not saying anything like in, in any way, uh, I don't want to be judgmental, but I have a weird idea that men, women, when they're working together in small boxes for long periods of time, year on year, that becomes their environment. And that becomes the way they think about the outside world.

Speaker 4:          00:58:15       This is us. This is really important because in comedy, the man shall remember we had to do sexual harassment training. Yeah. For a show that's basically about sexual harassment. And it was. But in comedy, yeah, we think that we can get away with all this shit. So I find myself extrapolating that on a people that are in a workplace, I don't know what it's like to work in an office where the boss says, Hey, you can move up to assistant regional director if you watch me jerk off. And that's a different thing. And it's, that's a real problem. And the man is the only time I've kind of hit like the corporate world, cross corners of comedy meets corporate where he is. Someone might be in the story I have in here that I couldn't have known when we turn this book in final draft that this current climate would exist.

Speaker 4:          00:59:10       So. So there's a bunch of stories. Where do you remember mandic? What was the mandate waves? I get a assistant producer, director guy. He was one that we all fucking hated. He was just a ruthless Douche. And then when we went up to. This is the story that's in the book at the Bunny Ranch and Dennis Hoff tells us both, hey, you can have one of my girls on the house. Carrot top is fucked my girls so and so is fucked my girls. And rogue is like A. First of all, not only am I married, but I wouldn't want to be in that litany of names that you dropped that of other celebrities that have fucked your hookers. He's like, no, no, I wouldn't drop your name. We played

Speaker 2:          00:59:52       pretty women. Remember that? Pretty woman for those ladies that worked there.

Speaker 4:          00:59:58       Oh, well that was the gag we did. No, I don't remember anything. We did the match.

Speaker 2:          01:00:03       It was weird. It bummed me out because like they were crying and some of them wouldn't montage that they wished that that had been the case and that someone would come and rescue them. I was like, God damn it. Like this isn't funny.

Speaker 4:          01:00:17       Yeah, turn now. I remember it. Now that you say it,

Speaker 2:          01:00:21       dude, for me man. I was like, Oh God. You almost like, I, uh, I've adopted a lot of dogs in my life, you know, and I've taken on a lot of friend projects, especially when I was young that enough things have happened that lead me to believe that I have a lot of like a rescue in parenting type feelings about nurturing people that feel like they're in danger by themselves now. Very vulnerable. So when I see something like that and I'm like, Oh, Christ, you know, I just, you realize you don't, you don't really realize because you know, you don't see their lives on a daily basis, but you realize in that moment you're like, oh, this isn't funny at all. And you know, there's no way to like you think things are funny on paper, like you think, ah, this is going to be funny. We'll show a bunch of prostitutes a video about a lady who was prostitution going, white guy, the perfect guy. And then they fell in love and it worked out. He rescued her man Dick. I don't remember that.

Speaker 4:          01:01:24       He's, he was an assistant. He was in charge enough that he absolute power corrupts absolutely. While he was an absolutely powerful, but he was absolutely fucking annoying and we didn't like him, but I still have this offer on the table. They're wrapping up the shoot the last night. They're picking up all the equipment. I'm talking to air force amy, who's this veteran. Hilarious hookers who's been there. Yeah, she fucking carried me through that whole thing. We just sit and drink at the bar and laugh at everything. Inappropriate and talk shit. And I go, hey, we get this freebie from Dennis Hoff. I know he's going to have to pay you. So, uh, how about I just a jerk off in front of you while you deldot yourself. You get paid. We come back to the bar. Yeah. Great. She's Deldot at herself. I dark gfe come back to.

Speaker 4:          01:02:16       I come out of the room, which is right around the corner from the. I'm covered in a t shirt with my own ges. All I need to do is wait to find wardrobe. I get a new t shirt. I walk out. This guy that we hate is wrapping up. He's walking up the stairs as I'm walking down the stairs to the bar and I go mandate. Great. Shoot. Good hair. Fucking hug it in and I hug him in front of all these people at the bar. Who knows? I just jerked and I'm smearing it into an illegal. Yeah, I've done it. That's a me too. That guys from the corporate world. I smeared them with just to humiliate him. Oh my God. How fucking wrong could I like, it's terrible. I shouldn't be completely outed for made this up. I'd send the book, but I hope I'm selling the whole book of Hashtag [inaudible] first.

Speaker 4:          01:03:06       Not me too. Interesting. I, uh, I want to say that this last piece by Mr Doug Stanhope was fiction and A. Well, I had to change his name. So it was a nickname man who was telling me that, uh, trump's lawyer said that he tweeted for trump. Trump said something that was fucked up. Trump's lawyer was like, no, no, no. I tweeted that one for him. Oh, alright. I've been getting a lot of tweets that say, Hey, my lawyer wrote that, and I'm like, I don't know. I didn't know what it meant is. Come on. How fucking funny is that? I have, I have a whole chapter about pulling my dick out. I used to do that all the time. I'd go on stage naked or pull my dick. I remember those days. Yeah, the dark days I was, I was thinner than. So I just have a different meaning.

Speaker 4:          01:03:50       I gave him a bunch of pictures, Hennigan here, the, the Scotsman I pulled out. I pulled my dick out in front of Bert Kreischer on a podcast two nights ago. I can't remember. I can't remember why we were so fucked. I've been begging him not to air it because I don't know what I said, but I've seen Ari's Dick About 100 times what? So for the book I sent a bunch of pictures with Hennigan to pick and choose and then they took all these dick pics of me in public and I'm like, you can't have all the picture section, just my Dick. So I had to decide. So this one I decided on this not having any idea it could be so perfectly timed. The top one is me with my dick out in a kilt in front of a blind guy at Karaoke while he's singing, having no idea, but the one below it is me starting to pull my dick out in front of Louis.

Speaker 4:          01:04:37       Oh my jerk off in front of the abusers. Wow. Did you find crime? I didn't have to block the door. He didn't block the door folks, by the way, that's not. That's not real. Apparently. That's like something that like gets passed on. Like an urban myth that juices up the story. I'm saving this for tomorrow. I'm doing a dork forest with Jackie cation and Lori Kilmartin, so I'm saving the bulk of my Lori, my Louis C K for that, just because they are ladies I want. There are going solid opinion, but I, I'm, I have to make this so spacious timewise because I don't want to out the person, but

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       I was doing comedy and I was a comedian. I knew back in the day when we were young in another millennium, just blame it on Brown. She said, you're never going to guess what I just did. I just watched Louis C K jerk off in the ladies room and I went, why don't she goes, yeah. He said, Hey, would you? She's like, I don't care. And as we've caught up many, many years later, she goes, yeah, I just did it because it was funny. I really, I did it because it was a story to tell and I said, you coming forward. Because afterwards when she said what she told me that I go, you never watched me jerk off. Got To watch the beach or I pull my dick out and put on for this. You Watch, you watch. No, she just said, yeah, I don't care. Whatever. She like.

Speaker 3:          01:06:04       It's no fun if you don't watch. The way I remember it is that she remembers me saying, if you don't like it, don't look either way. It was just a goof. She were. I think you have to stand up to. I think what we should do to normalize this whole. Luis, hang on. This is the important part of this is when I said, are you going to come out? She can't because she just did it because it was funny of course, and she would almost be putting a place where she would be as it's people like you that made him into a monster. We're just kind of a goof back that no one cared. It's only weird and it was very polite. So when I heard the Louis ck stories later on, I just assumed it was like that. He was very polite. Hey, would you watch me jerk off?

Speaker 3:          01:06:50       Well, I had heard from someone else that I had talked to someone who had gotten the story from Louis and the version of it through the grape vine. So don't take this as like verbatim was something along the lines of. No, it was just, he thought it was silly to like pull his dick out and take pictures with them and that I had heard that he was saying that it wasn't, he didn't actually masturbate in front of them. That was like one version of it. So I was like, okay, well maybe that what? And then the full story came out and I went, oh okay. And then someone had said, yeah, but he asked them first. I was like, Oh boy, what are we doing with this? This is another important beat is my story happened before he was in any position of power other than comics looked up to him.

Speaker 3:          01:07:37       He was still writing for comics that might've had some power at at best. I think it was a power thing. If you're a man and you have your alone in a room with a woman, and this is my perception of it. It's always a power thing because it's fucking weird because you can kill them. It's different. Like have you ever been around like a UFC athletes on big giant? This was a place where you go, if you, if this was a tinder date, this happened in a place where you'd go, I want to meet you in public, so don't want to be. So yeah, it was completely safe. Yeah, but if. But if you're alone in a room with a man, it's like being an, you know that a

Speaker 2:          01:08:15       man has some sexual urges directed towards you and you're a woman. It becomes a vulnerable situation and if there's some weird shit where someone. If let's say someone was blocking the door because I had heard that Louis didn't block any doors, then it becomes really crazy. Like what do you do? Well, first of all, you're hearing. Yes. Yeah. Well it's also like I think the thing that people have the hardest time with all of this is you never want to think that it's possible that someone would do something horrible to somebody if you like them. Right? Like with all of this, with any of the, whether it's Kevin Spacey or any of these people, like maybe you liked him as an actor. I like that guy. He's great on house of cards. Wait a minute, is you really just terrorizing people and grabbing dicks everywhere? Shit.

Speaker 2:          01:09:06       Yeah. I keep people around time. I do too. I do too. I still grab ass and Dick's. Oh, that's not what I do, but no, I think about it that way at my house when. Oh, when you guys. We had a party the other night. I go, who have I not got groped in appropriately. Okay. Wait, Gill, I haven't done it to you and I grabbed his dick just to make sure that we're all fucking good. Never groped me. I'm starting to feel a little left out. I don't think nothing. I don't even think you've ever gotten from my, but I might've googled it from afar. I think you might have spanked me once, but the point being it's like, come on, we gotta just people have to figure out some way to interface with each other 100 percent of the time as equal and just work on your own bullshit, but when the way you talk to people, like somebody brought this up once that they initially with a lot of this stuff is that it's someone in the same business that's in this position of being a great artist like Kevin Spacey type character or whatever, and then the other person is like a pa or something like that and he prays on them and it's his show and they can't get away and he's like attacking them.

Speaker 2:          01:10:11       They're straight and these gay. Absolutely. I know that 100 percent. I think that's some weird, almost like reptilian instinct that humans can't tell you how many times we've had to because you know my audience overserved quite a bit of the time and when it's a girl that's alone and you can see the packs of guys. Oh good. Do. I'll give you a ride. Where do you live? Exactly. All right. Let's get her an uber because I know that's going to go poorly and you know it's fucked up about that. Here's what's really fucked up. Not only was the woman the like the vulnerable one when it comes to like the possibility of violence, right? She's also the vulnerable one when it comes to her reputation because like if you and like chat. Yeah, right. If you and Bert Kreischer and five dudes and a girl hops in the car with you and she decides to suck everybody off and then you tell the world and someone leaks her name and they're like, it hurts her, but if you get up, if you're hitchhiking

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       and you get picked up by six chicks who decided to below you and film it and put it on the Internet and you're cracking jokes and pitching your book, your book was chicken sucking your Dick. You're a king. You're a Goddamn king that's worship you because they'll throw up a red carpet down in front of your van. As you get out and bowed to you as you climb out, send. Another huge issue is how we treat women. Being able to guide their own sexuality, a 100, that's a big part of what's going on in raise your daughters in a different way than you raise your sons and that's why it's okay for a teacher to fuck a boy kid. Right? Exactly. And it is. By the way, we're won't even say a word. It should be treated the same. You should raise your kids to know about sex.

Speaker 3:          01:11:59       You know what? If you raised your daughters, it's a woman. I should say this as long as it's a woman. If you raised your daughter with the same openness that you raise your son, she'd know not to fuck a 35 year old soccer coach when she's 15 because you were open. You told her, here's the pitfalls of life. This is what it's about. Guys are going to try to buck you. You don't. You caught all women and I believe it's as much a parenting problem as anything else. It really is fucking fascinating that you would have no problem if a really hot teacher fucked your 16 year old son for really hot woman teacher like built like Pamela Anderson back in the Baywatch days if somehow they teach it. No, no, no. Yeah, you should be a little more discriminating. But if it was a hot one, you have no problem with it.

Speaker 3:          01:12:49       Some Pamela Anderson, like Gao is having sex with your 17 year old boy and he's got a six pack. Yeah, fuck. You have Tommy who were a winner. But if you reverse the genders, it's a horrific offense. Like some handsome man has reduced your beautiful little daughter who's only 17. Fuck. That guy needs to be in a cage. Appeared that, that alone is like, this is where I can't extend the argument because I've never been a woman. That's true. Uh, and that's why I've been meaning to talk to you about saving a lot of this for a while. I have hosts can a comeback. Do you remember when we were going to get married? Yeah. That was the last call I'm going to get married. I don't know if that's in the book or not. The last call I made when we knew the man show is going to get canceled.

Speaker 3:          01:13:39       They wouldn't. That might be in the book. I think it is. They, uh, the last call I made, they wouldn't tell us it's canceled. They leave you hanging on the vine. But, uh, I was at the Atlanta punchline and I remember being in the parking lot and Massachusetts had just passed gay marriage or civil unions, or maybe you called me up. I called Zoe Friedman first. Zoe Friedman was called Zoiah before he checked on me. Maybe I called you first, but she's the one that counted because she was our goto person at comedy central. And I said, listen, before you us,

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       give us one last episode where Jo and I get gay married and it just goes into this montage, but it's the opposite of every marriage cliche where we're fishing together and no one's arguing, no one's fighting over the remote. We're all happy. We're both happy to be watching the same thing and it's just a perfect life together

Speaker 2:          01:14:34       to imagine that people decided to do that. Imagine if they had best friends, get married as best friends, like it's nothing sexual in the contract. Zero sexual obligation. It's not sex. It's like you are getting married as best friends like for real than Bros before hoes. Just stop and think about how many, not obviously not the current relationships we're involved in. We would never go so far, but if you go back to like your twenties, just imagine being stuck with some gap when you're both God damn wreck, right? You're both crazy. You're both 21 or whatever the fuck you. Are. You both completely out of your mind. You're basically babies alone in the world. You don't know what the fuck you're doing. Imagine living with that Gal for the rest of your life versus your friend from back then. I'm still friends with my buddies from when I was 21, Jimmy lawless. I talked to that dude all the time. We text each other back and forth all the time. I've been friends with him since I was 15 or 14. I might've been 14 when I met him.

Speaker 4:          01:15:28       I don't know. Doug. I hate your cigarette smoke during the podcast. A. Okay. I'll put in a a air purifier

Speaker 2:          01:15:35       and that's the beef. That's our marriage beef. This is our meat. This is something I really did. I call it the dice clay option because die every time diocese here, he chain smokes more than you and dice just hammers. We got an air cleaner that we would sit right behind him and turn that thing on just to suck out the cigarette smoke because it's either that the air purifiers belching sewage by the second hour is just brown tar. Well, he's the guy that to this day I still fan boy in front of. I can't believe I'm friends with dice clay like a really can't. Every time I see him I'm like, he's up to feel like you're friends with them. Like I've. I've only met him a few times, but I never saw like a human side to him. He's always been anthony. He's in character.

Speaker 2:          01:16:19       You can get there with them. I don't want to, I don't want to see him like that. He's a good guy, man. I don't want to see the emperor with no clothes. His clothes are still on. I'm telling you. It's all right. He's just a guy that's like, you know, dice clay was gigantic and he got hit with the first wave of comedy haters. Like people don't remember what I was 19. It was me and my girlfriend Marta, and we were parked out in front of my house and we were listening to a dice clay cassette in my car and we were fucking crying. I mean, tears are coming down my face. I was 19, I think she was 19 too. We were both like, yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:17:01       Ah, ah, ah. Never

Speaker 2:          01:17:04       even considered doing standup at this point just so I was dying laughing. He's the reason I got into Stanford. He was a monster.

Speaker 3:          01:17:11       He was a monster. And he was telling Rena he was coming off the whole wave of Paul Riser. Yes. Yes. There was no backlash. Yes. We already noticed. Thanks Jennifer. Notice rather, fuck you. Paul Riser is amazing on stranger things. Uh, he's amazing. You should fucking kids. Demagogue. Oregon's what? Exactly. Don't know. You have no demagogue and knowledge on the fucker talking out your ass. I tried, I want to say about stranger things. I watched five minutes of the first one and I'm like, I can't watch kids and fuck it. It looked like that. It gets better. It gets so good. It's such a good show. How dare you try to fail. I'm gonna. I'm gonna. I'm gonna. Hey, can you see, I hate to use my, a scotsman as a, a errand boy. Is there a coke in there? Tried to find them. I'm not. I don't think so.

Speaker 3:          01:18:07       There's some, there might be a. nevermind Kansas Divia go in there, motherfucker. Come on. It sounds like it's gone. Fucking something in it. No, it's okay. Brian, he left. Sorry. I think there's like one can as eva. He [inaudible] it sounds like it has stevia. Yay. Fuck that. No Way. Can we, um, the first cans of coke? I just assumed. No, I brought whiskey because I assumed he wouldn't have club soda. So, uh, I thought if I'm going to have a vodka drink, I'll just drink mimosas. I'm fine. That's a good move. We can have some God for me. Oh No, I don't need. I know. I just assumed everyone has tried to work our way through this whole experience here at this new spot. We're not totally locked into place. If you want some unhealthy options, I'll have some gluten heavy pasta. I have plenty of.

Speaker 3:          01:18:59       I was going to change up. I'm not going to you. Here's what we'll do next time you come here. I will have my nonexistent assistant send you an email with like a, a ride. You don't want to run like a writer, like white m's. No, no, no. It's good. Stevia. Stevia is a good dude. They're good and Italian. You just give it a chance. So it's awful. No, no. Sugar is fake. Show that it's not. It's a plan already. Son of a coach. Bingo takes the Stevia all the fucking time. But these sodas are good, man. I'm telling you, they're really good and they're not going to kill your sugar. Leaves such a bad taste in your mouth and I can't taste anything after 35 years of smoking plant extracts. It's a sweet thing that doesn't Jack up your glycemic index. It's good for you, Bro.

Speaker 3:          01:19:45       Send me to stay alive. Hannegan that you sent me. Just so you can talk about me. Not One handling has been dealing with subterfuge. It's no fun talking behind your back when we can do it to your face. Hennigan, enjoy. He's one of the things I enjoy about you is you are very self deprecating fellow who is. You are. You could take a good jab. Yeah. And you give one back. Yes. Cheers to that. Thank you. Is that a Scottish thing? Seemed it seemed a little bit more fun over there. I would say the sculpt so good at being self deprecating and calling. I couldn't come. Yeah. And your billy connolly. Yeah. He was like the main guy over there as far as standup and he. That was his whole thing. He embodied that. Yeah, just happy dude. Thing is a big thing in Scottish society, which means one of the few good things I'll save her scholarship society is it's kind of egalitarian and we enjoy knocking.

Speaker 3:          01:20:38       People don't who think they're better than other people, including yourself. Australians do that shit too. They call it the tall poppy syndrome and Japan. Yeah, I think it's good, man. Good. You know what I mean? I think that's one of the things. We're also going to always be 100 percent and it goes back to your thing about punching up. Not yet occasionally, because here's the thing about this whole punching up, punching down thing. I always bring up Sam Kennison bit about the Ethiopian kids that were starving to death. It's one of the fucking greatest all time bits and it's all hundred percent punching down. He's got to, in my opinion, I mean if you have a list of the greatest of all time bits to have them in my mind or Sam Kennison and one of them was the Ethiopian kids was like, you know, you're sitting at home, you got a dinner, you made it out yourself.

Speaker 3:          01:21:22       You know, you're sitting in front of the TV, feel good about life and all of a sudden this fucking kid is starving kid and there's a guy right next to them like, could you please just give a couple dollars a month? So this guy goes, hey, and you're like, hey, why don't. Why don't you feed them? You're right next to them. I think it was. I all I remember from that bit is send a moving trucks. You. The way the food is. Yeah. Yeah. He goes deserts in America to which it was chaos because it was the most punching down bit of all time. Starving children in Ethiopia. I don't think that's punching. Punching at the people that are selling you this as you're grabbing the little Ethiopian by, Hey, come here, come here motherfucker. Collateral damage. Going to 100 years now. Fucking punching down. I was talking about specifically twitter fights were like Christine Levine, who's at a Mammo, she's a friend of mine.

Speaker 3:          01:22:29       She opens for me quite as her name Malmo is that. That was her nickname when I met her online. I know so many people based on their twitter name phase back in the day, well before that were a Icq. What does that. She. She's a, she's a, what does that fucking text Iq? I remember that Shit. I was, I was doing the dot comedy dot standup. Didn't find the ICQ, but uh, there's something freeing about being able to talk to someone. You don't know what the fuck they look like. They don't know what the fuck you look like. You can just chat with each other online. Something freeing about that. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       You know, you like, you get to know people just for the information.

Speaker 4:          01:23:10       I just know that you're annoying. It has nothing to do with your sexuality, your race, your religion. I just know you're annoying as a human being and you realized that I judged you for no other reason than you.

Speaker 2:          01:23:21       And some people will trickier, but some people, you meet them online and they turn out to be the exact same thing when you meet her in person and they're really cool.

Speaker 4:          01:23:31       I've met some of the funniest people, Funny Online, funny that when you meet them, biggest social retards that they can't have or can't make eye contact, can't deliver the law if they're on the keyboard. They're the funniest person. They just have no social skills. They can't present themselves. Right. This guy is funnier than me. Await in real life. No, he's not. He could never do what we do, but he could write from a in a dark room. This is chick

Speaker 2:          01:24:06       that is unbelievably hilarious on twitter and I found a recently. What is it? Nacho. Sarah. What is, what is? Yes, what is that, Jill? Sarah. But I think that's her twitter handle. Dude. She's fucking hilarious. Like I'll go to her like every two, three days. I'll just go and check her twitter page just to see what ridiculous shit she posts. She's really fucking funny and I'm like, are you a standup? Like. And she's like, well, I tried to wants, but you know, you know who I because are right. They're not. Joe. Sarah

Speaker 4:          01:24:39       said, this is the same problem I have with my, uh, twitter crush is Laura Duck. The one arm girl. Okay. Yeah. She, she made kind of national news, twitter at national news because she put on her tinder. She's an arms dealer. She had just lost her arm. Laura or Lauren Duck, a duck fan is the twitter account duck fans up there? Uh, and she, yeah, she, she got her arm lopped off by a train and she posts also. It's as somebody shit. But she also posts really funny shit. And I said, I wish when I come to San Diego that you had a set because you're hot, you have one arm, everything's already in your favor. You're already naturally funny.

Speaker 2:          01:25:29       Yeah. There's some fucking funny people on tour. There's some funny people that work at the post office. They just don't get a chance to like the idea that we have figured out a way to monetize. The way we look at things is so offensive. It's so fast. There's so many people in so many jobs, so they're just as funny as us. They or maybe way more like my friend Dave Dolan, rest in peace who is one of my bosses back when I was first starting doing standup, he was a private investigator. Funniest person I've ever met in my life right next to Joe eps. He's like right up there. He was.

Speaker 3:          01:26:03       He was a private investigator and I worked for him because he got caught in a Dui, needed a driver, so he put an ad in a for an assistant for a private investigator and I was looking for a day job while I was doing standup at nine. It was like perfect assistant for a private investigator, this God damn comic books and so I started working for this guy and he's this crazy Irish private investigator. Wild Man. I mean, he's a fucking wild man. He was so funny and he would just tell me stories about nutty, shitty did and crazy fucking girls. He knew and you know, just just. I would be in my car crying, laughing, waiting for this person to come. We'd be at like 5:00 in the morning parked like doing like surveillance on someone's house, like waiting for them to leave their house at 5:00 in the morning if someone's like doing like some sort of insecurity scam.

Speaker 3:          01:26:52       Mostly it was insurance and he would just. I would be crying and I was thinking I'm trying to be a comic. This guys five, six years older than me at least like maybe nine years older than me. I think I was 20 and was like 30. Is it an attorney? The attorney, he was an animal. I mean he was so fucking funny and I was like, I'll never be as funny as him. I just will never be as funny as him. Like this is depressing. I loved working for the guy and I worked for him for the entire six months that he needed to have no license after he got arrested for a Dui. Stayed friends and I love that guy. In the book I talk about Becker and Andy, like two guys that are way funnier than me and a fuck them. They never could put it together on stage.

Speaker 3:          01:27:37       I want to be as much as they say, they're trying to be like you. I'm trying to be like them. Right. You know those funny people, you know? Yeah. I want, I want to steal that essence because I know how to put it on stage. Never be naturally off the cuff as funny as the funniest people I've met, but I can do it on stage and you can't, so fuck you. Uh, that's ruthless. I can, I can boil down the organization. There's some sort of writer correspondent he should have. You should have a policy that sexual harassment is mandatory and everybody works inside the Doug Stan Hope. Information Collection Organization like anybody's trying to help you with the creation of your act idea gathering. What have you. It was an unspoken each other until now. No, it's kind of the thing and that's why we were talking about the no one's meet doing rock and roll bands. Like they're not pulling led Zeppelin's library off of itunes because they fucked, fucked a girl with a fish. But here's my. When you walk into the backstage area at a rock'n'roll concert, there's an unwritten rule. Yeah, the, the, the roadie tapped you on the shoulder for a reason and you know what the reason is I was made to feel uncomfortable. He pulled out his dick out of sweaty leather pants after the show underwear. No underwear. And then girls were bumps off

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       of it. No, they were gunners mostly because of the ball sweat a governors. I understand there's a difference between that and what happens with fucking Harvey Weinstein. That's a fucking rapist. Yes. One hundred percent. And here's the part, part of the problem is that what we were talking about earlier, that if you got in a car with seven women and they all fuck you, you're a hero, would have a gal gets in the car with seven. Jason Mamoa was that uh, the guy from the game of thrones, that fucking beautiful handsome man, that gigantic cancer man, he's so huge and so beautiful, like have seven of those were in a car and it was a gal and she was just like ravaged, ravaged, and she's some sort of a damage thing. We know those, we know those girls that celebrate that. No, no. We know the ones that are like, yeah, I fucked that guy.

Speaker 2:          01:29:51       I know a few. Yeah, for sure. That are just like, dudes. You shouldn't be like that for everybody. It's a suppression issue. It's the same reason why Catholics feel guilty. It's not a matter of why what's wrong or what's right. It's a matter of what you enjoy and what you don't enjoy it because other people are going to judge you for it and then you've got to get to the root of why these people judging it for a giant percentage of the men that judge women for their sexual activity. It's 100 percent out of jealousy, so 100 percent out of the idea that this woman would not want to do that with them and they cast a judgement on her and they decided that her needs are different than our than the demands needs, but the bottom line is all these things were established back when it was really difficult to have children and you had to protect your children and most of them are going to die and you were literally concerned about the population of your village.

Speaker 2:          01:30:35       Well, those instincts, they still exist, but the problem is that's not a concern anymore and then this fucking birth control and whatever, 19, 60, whatever. That chick came out. When did that come out? When the chick start being superheroes was a early seventies when roe versus Wade and control and all that. Yeah, it should be even, you know, there's, there's gotta be some sort of a way to make it even easier than all this has gotta be a way where you let the natural hormones will think what has happened is 60 and nailed it to nailed it. I think it did. Nineteen 60. I thought were going to make the argument for bringing back villages. Well, it's not a bad idea, man. Here's the thing. I think cities are amazing, but I don't think we're designed for it and I think we will be ready for it and a couple hundred years it's going to take some sort of an adaptation to the human psyche and the way we interact with each other, but I think it's totally doable if people like us can do it.

Speaker 2:          01:31:28       This is how I've always felt. If the entire world was the four of us in this room, we will be fine. Like what if we were the only people with what if we were immortal? We didn't have to worry about dying and it was just the four of us and it just a bunch of food and shit to do. Do you think we would have any problem at all? Yeah, we would miss the fact that we're in. He checks. That'd be kind of a bummer, but we would probably have a good time. We just had unlimited resources, Roman around, which we do. Yeah. Well, essentially the, the, the world like wildfire in Ventura spreads

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       across the world while this podcast goes on and on, and then we walk out and you're like, oh, fucking Zombie apocalypse without the zombies. The zombies kicking into that of ashes sent those on the grill. They showed us how to use it could press buttons and I'm going to have to drink stevia. I'll, I'll get irritated by that. Just do me a favor. Give them a little. No, no, no, I've, I've done it. You're racist. Just try it. I don't know if it's hot in here, but I'm actually sweating from the gears and I thought it's because Joe Rogan's bellowing so much. I'm bleeding out of my earphones. Sorry, but it's actually sweat. I'm sweating on your earphones and whoever sits here next. I hope he's OCD because. Are you a just leapt up. Fire it up. I'm trying to be too loud. No, no, no one was giving me shit.

Speaker 3:          01:32:51       I know. I just never know when you're being real. No, no. I am sweating from my earphones and I think that's gross that I'm sweating on your earphone so I had to say it. I don't give a fuck dude. I don't give a fuck about period blood. I don't give a fuck about sweat. That bothers me. I've never seen people do bother me because I am everything. I would assume that they find to be a problem. I'm filthy. I think you should eat meat with 30 hands. That's what I think. I think you should eat meat with dirty. If I know someone's OCD, I'm afraid to be around them. I'm comfortable. I have a friend who went to look at a house and they were looking at the house and as a nice house like wow, this house beautiful. And then they got to this one closet and the closet was filled with Purell, with hand sanitizer and they went, fuck this.

Speaker 3:          01:33:41       Like this house is haunted my friends. That dude, the fucking thing was filled. It was a closet. It was filled from the floor all the way to the top of pure route. They were like, you knew stern and ONA. I don't know if both. Oh, and a one of them at least they were all purell touching everything and if I get a cold and my, my guttural smoker's cough is enough that you're gonna not want me here. I cough off Mike. I try to, but I know he's going to hear it and go. Think about how many people you interact with and shake hands with. I think the more people you share your biome with, like Paul stamets, the mushroom guy, you know, he has some pretty famous mycologist who's on my podcast really recently. It's amazing stories, but one of the things that he said is like if you come in contact with someone, their biome interacts with your biome and you, there's a, some sort of a residual amount of DNA that you're taking into your own biome. Like, like if you meet somebody, you become part of them and some very bizarre way. I was like, what? He's like intro, introduce in like, you know, welcome to my home, and I was like, this is crazy. Welcome to my. He's a scientist so he's not like just bullshitting and he's not like some crazy dude who doesn't believe in birds.

Speaker 3:          01:35:06       Go on it. You told me something on a podcast years ago and it's one of those things that comes up late at night where I go, I want to call Rogan, but I'm not going to call you at 1130 at night. And what was the thing that you said? Listen, call me anytime you call me. You want to call me, call me please. I don't bother you. You can see. Do you see love to use a quote from you on the back of this book? No, no, I called people that if they said no, we're not friends. Anyway, Chris Rock said No. Well I don't know him. Anyway, he's a nice guy. I know he is. He wrote me a better quote. He then I would have. I would love to quote your book, man. Don't ever asked me. I mean don't ever worry about asking me. I don't want to put anyone on the spot.

Speaker 3:          01:35:51       I'll put me on the spot. I love you. You, you had one of my favorite people. If I have a top 20 people that survived and everybody dies, you're in like if there was like some sort of an apocalypse though, we'll work on it with a side. He gained like five of year free. So I got five of mind family, whoever need to know this still alive. You told me something about over the course of I think 20 years, the amount of uh, of cells. You're not even the same person you were seven years. Tell it with your smart way of saying it. I'm, by the way, this is like third hand smart way because I'm clearly a retard, but if you go back to like seven years ago and then today you literally don't have the same cells in most of your body. The only thing that doesn't regenerate as the neurons, the neurons do not regenerate, but every cell in your body is different than the cells in your body from seven years ago.

Speaker 3:          01:36:45       So what are your memories remain? And this is part of the problem. It's become you become a victim to the momentum of your past behavior and there's nothing you can do about it. So if you're Kevin Spacey, you decided six months ago, I am not grabbing any more dicks. I'm fucking done with this. I'm going to be a better person. Like you are attached the momentum of your past behavior. You know, no matter what, even if you're not even that guy anymore, like seven years later, you wake up, you wake up in the morning, shit, what did I grab? Grab some decks. Fuck,

Speaker 6:          01:37:19       why did I do that? Granted, God dammit. Oh, I was so drunk.

Speaker 3:          01:37:27       That's something you can do. You're stuck with that idea like we have, we have to get past that. We have to figure out a way. I think Pi, they have to take those electric things and fucking change your brain. Like she like shock therapy and then we'll let you ride when you don't account for growth and that. This is my huge thing. If I had a, uh, a charity that I was behind, if I was on dancing with the stars, which think is going to be in those negotiations were going on in. Remember, listen, don't you killed Doug Stanhope. I had a fucking Dina since pot seen before men. Uneasy. He wants to die by the innocence project. Let me, let me, let me get this point out. And then let's go back to dancing with Joe Innocence project. That's my thing. And uh, I don't, I've never been locked up when I was innocent.

Speaker 3:          01:38:24       It's just, it's my fear. And when you terrifying fear of the entire prison system, the justice system, the prison doesn't work whatsoever. And when you lock someone up at 18 years old for some shit you, you, you grow out of these things, like you're not accepting that as you age, you rethink things and you're, it's full. It's totally ineffective way to reform people as well. Most prisons, some prisons are trying to be more progressive with their scandinavia. Iceland, yes. Mostly outside of America. America has a real problem and one of the real problems is there's not all of it, but a certain amount of the press. Yes. For profit and these private prison systems. Anytime something's for profit, the system benefits from these laws being uniform or increasing in severity and like. So if you have like a way where people can profit. Like this was the issue that I had with marijuana.

Speaker 3:          01:39:24       Will you would find out that prison guard unions would be lobbying against marijuana for jobs. Yes. I'm like, police having done so well and what are we like our 45 now. Not Stepping on my new bits because that's all I have. That kind of stuff. But all of the things we're talking about. I was talking about Brian with Brian on the other day and we were talking about something and he was like, you know, I've been talking about this in my act and I'm like, of course you have because this is like what's really relevant today and I think that all of us have this weird thing like we don't want to step on each other's material and let of course you're going to see some of the same things that I'm seeing and I want to see your take on it as much as I want to see my take on it.

Speaker 3:          01:40:02       Oh, I'm just, I'm trying not to do punch line as key to the discourse and not go into bit. I have to. I know what you mean. Yeah, it's those bits are good, but you don't want to give them up yet. No, no, and honestly this one bit that goes with the entire rape thing. I have been missing just one ceiling chunk of this bit that's sometimes goes 25 minutes of too long and I just trying to get the point across and all this current climate as I keep calling it has me like that's what I was missing. Now I have specific examples of this guy versus this guy now it made the entire bit come together and now I'm off the road until March or like motherfucker. Now I actually want to go out and do more dates just because this a year and a half I think I've been working on this bucket and one stupid bit that happens.

Speaker 3:          01:41:02       You know Chris Rock said that he was working on that. I love black people. I hate niggers and remember that. Fuck you. Who says it? He wasn't white man doesn't. It was. It is in my estimation, one of the all time greatest, most significant standup comedy bits ever and when it hit, I remember I was just kind of starting out when that bit was like popular on that bit was like on cds and people would play it back and you'd see it on television. You'd be like, I was like, oh my God. It's like a perfect bit. Like he had it boiled down. The punch lines were so succinct. It was just Bam, Bam, Bam. And then I read that he had bombed with that pit for months and months before he figured out how to get it to work. I got hate mail from fan. It's not like agregious actually.

Speaker 3:          01:41:53       Well thought out. Hey, I saw you. I agree with most of what you say, but what you were saying, are you saying? And I'm like, no, that's not what I'm saying. That's what I'm trying to not say, but yeah, I'm having such a hard time alliterating this and everything that's happened in the last month or two has, oh now I can exactly point out what I'm saying. And I actually have reverse engineered it where I go, oh, I shouldn't be starting from where I was ending and then go the other way rather than apologizing and yeah. Yeah. Well it's been boarded out right when I get off the road fucking asshole. But you'll, it doesn't matter. It isn't an always kinda like fucking. It's, it keeps going like it's done in a new branch pops out of the tree and you're like, oh, this is what's going to bear fruit for.

Speaker 3:          01:42:44       I was doing these shitty gigs for fucking months and every night I hated going onstage and now I want to go onstage, but I don't have a Gig. Well, what I like, what I've found pretty recently, like within the last year, I mean is that that is all like some shit that I internalize and then if I can just like it express or, or respond to that, the least amount. Like all the weird shit. I know it exists. I have a weird set. It's too long. It's too this too that I don't like it. I know it exists. Don't, don't freak out, but, but understand what that is and then you know what that is. That's it didn't work. Now let's figure out how to fucking never let that happen again because there's a big difference with the swing between like the audience having a fucking amazing time or it was really good for 45 minutes that suck for 10 like shit.

Speaker 3:          01:43:32       There is no better learning experience that happens for decades than eating shit. Nothing will ever make you know, come back stronger than actually dying on your ass. But I'd rather be mediocre. But even mediocre like eating shit dude, I ain't shit after Jim Brewer in some weird suburb outside of the city in New York. I shit so hard. It changed my life. Probably not recently. No. It was like 93, maybe [inaudible] 93 and brewer and our just start now and I was fine. Like I really shouldn't have been headlining. There's no way I should have been headline. I had maybe 45 minutes that was mediocre at best and brewer and I had a great time all weekend. Friday two shows everything worked out great. But although if I'm being honest, I want to say that he had better sets, at least two of the three shows. At least two of the three shows he had better sets, but I had good sets. It wasn't embarrassing. And then the second show, Saturday night he made me eat a bus load of shit. I bombed like the one of the wars bombings ever of my career ever where it was like everything that came out of my mouth was a Dr. brick and he destroyed in front of me. I mean, destroyed the program. Like fucking crumbs. We're breaking up off of the fucking low hanging ceiling. You know that it was,

Speaker 4:          01:45:05       you know, those pipes. Actually I think I, that's I, I think I coined that. It was a like a brick. The words came out of my mouth like a brick through a funnel. It feels like you have a mouthful of dirt. The one I talked to the following and I where I can blame the middle. Act. Like sometimes they just don't like you. The middle I can take credit, but no, they just hated you. The one I couldn't follow for a week in Miami was Chris Porter, Chris Porter. Chris border. You know Chris Porter? Yeah. Fucking stoner. Fucking thin curly hair. He's very funny. But we're Miami Improv at the time. This was probably 2000 and it was a, an urban room black. Well No, no, because there was a lot of Cuban too. So, but yeah, maybe five white people that are scared.

Speaker 3:          01:46:06       Sammy Sosa, Cuban, 1993 or Sammy Sosa, Cuban, 2017.

Speaker 4:          01:46:11       Miami, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, dark. Not West Palm. My girls have lived first night I, I assumed I am getting fired. So I just go crazy. Took on. No, no, no. I went there throwing fucking empty cigarette packs at me on stage following Chris Porter who knew all the fucking recent hip hoppy things. He had all the current urban trends in Zack did he fucking destroyed and I'm up there like kind of knew with my anti authoritarian kind of point of view and fuck, vice cops have this fuck Nash. And he closed. It was right after. This'll probably dated when it, cause he was, it was when France wouldn't let us fly over their airspace. Yeah. If we say this point, that's the point. Being years later I got one of my best bits ever about nationalism out of that because he closed on fuck France if we had an to save their ass in two world wars.

Speaker 4:          01:47:15       And I turned that eventually in new one of my best bits ever because I would go up and I'd follow him going, yes, that's right. Chris bought there. That was the French coding you. Yeah. As Chris bought there, they're not. These are not door. Please help us. You. And it turned into that bid I did about nationalism. Where if we hadn't saved the French was at us, was at us guaranteeing routes in the trenches and Verdun was that you wouldn't be. I remember last night we were hammered. I don't remember saving the French. I remember we went through the drive through without a car. We did a lot of things, but we didn't save the French. You're talking about other people that did shit and you're taking credit for it. Nationalism does nothing but teach you how to take credit for other people's accomplishments. But the same can be said for rooting for the raiders, right?

Speaker 4:          01:48:09       Yeah, sure. Fucking warm boom. Right? Yeah. It's a very bizarre thing that we love to do and I think it's all connected to the. Why does home field advantage work? My fucking best idea. Affable so uncomfortable in that arena for all those other people. It's my best idea that no Billy Ball kind of people in the professional sports leagues are picking up on field a team of sociopath's because homefield advantage is one of the biggest things in sports. Home field advantage. If you feel the team of sociopath's that don't care about cheers or booze, yeah, there's no home field advantage anymore because these are psychopaths that don't care about cheers. They just want to win and kill. All right? That's not sustainable. You've got to shoot them after a couple of years, as soon as they start wearing diamonds in their watches, you got to shoot them in the locker room like what happened? What happened? How did he die?

Speaker 2:          01:49:02       Like W, W, w, Aaron Hernandez, that guy was a tinder. May Be eliminating the home team advantage for NBA players hating on it. The black man is tinder. I want you to consider the fact that a giant percentage of NBA players are people of color. You racist fucks. They're swooping into these white towns and banging all these white chicks and you got a problem tender home field advantage to make it easier for them. They don't have to go do work. They just. I'm sorry. I sorry, what? I say, come to the hotel instead of having to go into tinder. Tinder. Tinder. I'm sorry. I was just doing that for comedy.

Speaker 4:          01:49:39       Oh my God. If I was still a sexual being man as a sexual being, that's a Bernie Mac and

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       bad Santa Bernie Mac. Mac will be hilarious. Standup. You ever see Bernie Mac live? Mm. No. I saw Bernie Mac live at the comedy connection in Boston once and I was like, Holy Shit. He was. He was a powerful man. I mean his material was really funny, but shit, his delivery was like, like electric, like boom, boom. And His name of black comedian where you go. His material is great, but as deliveries under sold, um, don't say animals. Got a good delivery. Get this thing going on. He's my buddy Franklin Gi. Oh, Franklin at giant. The giant super low key with his delivery. Hilarious ideas and met him at the greenroom. Paul provenza wished that show is still on. Let's do the green room with Doug's hope. Well, podcasting is basically that. It is that as, but let's get on showtime for the fuck of it. Shit. So we can call her mom's show time.

Speaker 3:          01:50:54       Mommy and my mom's data. I forgot I said that right. I was. I was like, man, I feel guilty. Oh, it's stand up. Don't have to feel bad. I will call my grandma. My grandma's doing bro. Fucking Chad Shanky just came back from thanksgiving. He's like, uh, yeah. I had to go to my grandparents' house. Does he work for you? Does he know it's December fifth kind of fucking bullshit. Is this? Does that mean thanksgiving? Long time ago, motherfucker this work to be done? No. The point of the story was he was talking about being at Thanksgiving at his grandparent's house, who we revered and then how he brought his kid and his kids. Kids to globe, Arizona because he's not a family guy. Right. But then I started doing the math, like you have grandchildren and grandparents. That means the kids are going to meet their great, great grandparents.

Speaker 3:          01:51:47       Did you ever meet your great, great grandparents? Oh my. Almost all. My last grandparent died when I was 13 and both of my grandfathers were dead before I was born. My great, great grandfather on my. You were alive in the mud. Yeah. Yeah. Holy Shit. I barely remember though. Super Young. Really great parents. Great. Great grandparents are the people that built the stone that built this town before it was a town and this was all waste water. Well, my great, great grandfather decided to take his family from Italy to America in the 19. Well basically draw. That's right. Your mom's a Guinea better. Yeah, she's full on pop. Sorry. Yeah, she's full on Kenny. And uh, my father was half Italian, half Irish. The everybody was immigrants though from my mom's side. One hundred percent. My mother, my mother, her, her mother and her father, both from the old country. They see. We don't realize it because we're living in this weird fucking semi gentrified starbucks era of 2017. But just during my parents' time, people got on boats and they drifted from Europe across America and these shitty engines and they landed. I mean, it was like fucking decades after the titanic sank. These crazy fucks. They took the wildest chance ever. They floated across the Goddamn Atlantic Ocean to look for a better role in gut. Here on coach. Hey,

Speaker 6:          01:53:17       who from southwest? He was sitting right next to the toilet,

Speaker 3:          01:53:21       almost had a middle seat, but he finagled his way out of it to an aisle.

Speaker 6:          01:53:26       The boarding

Speaker 3:          01:53:29       group, a 15 through 30. I mean, this shit just happened. Our families all just got here. Even if you're third generation, that's fucking three generations. That ain't shit. It's nothing. Fourth-Generation fifth, shut the fuck Mark Burns who have been here since the 19 hundreds. Who Know that you just got here. Everybody just got here. I live in one of those towns where they, they, they love to say, Oh, I'm a native. Like, that makes you better because you never left and decided you wanted to be here as a functioning free thinking. Adult natives are the first people you discount was born hero. You just moved here. Well, yeah, because I was an adult and I decided I wanted to live here. You just didn't have the courage to leave and come back. Yeah. Sons of bitches fuck natives. It's not easy. It's not even that. Honestly, that was a native.

Speaker 3:          01:54:22       Not Native Americans. I know what you mean. They don't know where to go. They're drunk. The busy people don't know where to go. You don't have to go anywhere. Just make the place better. But the Vegas Vegas is one of those. Any city that is a only alive and thriving because of tourism, but then they take a stand because I was born here. Well, Vegas, Vegas, Hawaii, Hawaii does it with white people a little bit, but it'll knowing why they hate tourists, but if it wasn't for tourists, you're fucking farming pineapples. Are you finding farming pineapples? Are you selling crocs somewhere in a beach resort? Are you doing massage therapy? Are you doing chakra healing or are you farming pineapples? Because without tourists, you're farming pineapples and hoping Captain Cook's descendants come back and offer you some gifts, or you're eating fish that you just caught with a stick and you're trading money in the form of shells on a string. Right? That's okay too. Like why is bitcoin okay? But shells aren't good.

Speaker 3:          01:55:31       How come we can't treat you just paid me in shells to be here. Yeah, that's what I'm going to give you. Lumps of salt too. There were little lumps of salt and chocolate and the chocolate. Gold coins and ketogenic cookies and Stevia drinks. Stevia drinks. Okay. Over there. Let's do some ad copy. God dammit. What's up? Okay, I'm fine. Alright buddy. I want to ask you this headphones. Hang on. Joe Rogan was just in right before I shut off my phone. Giant. Now. Oh yeah, please order the book. You know what? Let's take a minute so people can go online and order. Doug Stan hope this is not fame. It's got awful stories that in the current climate, if the publisher read it right now, they'd go, we should probably pull this because. Yeah. So if you find it folks, everyone else is getting fired for what I'm celebrating, having done worse, copy it, copy it down and make sure these monsters out there.

Speaker 3:          01:56:32       Don't take it off the Internet. I have. I have the. You have the new beautiful space here. Thing. Endless yards and yards of space. The Wolf, you have the giant wolf out there. When you walk in the door there. Is that a Patrick Mcgee? Yes. Goes to ride. You know Chaley. Remember when I used to pit my tour manager against your red band, Greg. He's. Yeah, he's my guy. He loves. I love him. On Your podcast. He, him and his twin brother do that for a living. They have their own ghost ride productions, which is a huge hot. They make this shit. Patrick Mcgee that did your woolf works for Greg Chili's twin brother. That's a ghost ride productions if you want weird shit like that. Joe Rogan, I hope you're a loyal sponsor now. I've only ghost ride productions. They do all this shit. Shaylee does the. He does a haunted house at the in the front yard in Brisbane.

Speaker 3:          01:57:35       He does haunted front yard and he brings all this shit down. Every Halloween is so geeked up to do it. The only thing is maybe I want it to be one of these guys when I was a kid too. That was a huge star wars fan to the point where I wanted to be like a Rick Baker. I wanted to do that for a living. And uh, Pat Mcgee was on the podcast and we're both huge fans of an American in London. That's a biggie. That's right there. That right there. He was on the podcast a few years back and uh, I, I found the American Werewolf in London that, that a cop, what it is, is a, it's a replica of the thing that's in the movie and Pat sells it. You can order it online and he, um, he builds it, but it's like the real exact scales, like one and a half times the size, the real werewolf, the Werewolf, a smaller. My werewolves bigger. I just texted when we got here today, I texted a picture that, that to Chile and he goes, oh, that looks like a, a. I go, hey, how's this for Halloween? Two thousand 18 for is haunted Yardi, doesn't Bisbee, and he goes, that looks like a Patrick Mcgee. He's done work for my brother. I. Wow, if you called

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       that and Joe Rogan, you fucking amazing. He nailed it. I think I had to correct myself. I said it's a one and a half times larger. I don't think that's right. I think it's more like 40 percent larger or something. Now that I think about it, I think I'm confusing it with something else, but the the copy that he makes is definitely larger so he could work on the finer details. There's like blood on the teeth and the hairs. It's all yak hair around the head and it's all synthetic shit in the back, but that's, that's his work. But if you look at like the blood around the teeth do. Here's the thing, man. Fucking amazing. I get great pleasure every time I come to work and I look at that Werewolf. I fucking love it. I love it. I love looking at that thing. I love the fact that I'm a fucking grown up

Speaker 4:          01:59:24       be used for anymore. I smile all the time. Yeah, yeah. Well you were showing us some shit and you just smiled like, wow, that's so fucking rare smile. You used to be a lot angrier.

Speaker 2:          01:59:37       I like it. I got out of that. You know what it's like we were talking about before. It's like, what do you use in your energy on? Are you using your energy on being upset at things and being in this constant sort of like a momentum of being upset from the past that you never stop or do you figure out a way to like hit the brakes? I go, okay, why are we angry? What are we getting upset? Why don't we just take all that cave man Shit and just go smash some punching bag and then come back to reality and be like really relaxed about it, but do it purposely like have some sort of intent behind it to eliminate the demons and I figured out how to do that. Somewhere along the line.

Speaker 4:          02:00:15       Aging helps a lot, but it's not

Speaker 2:          02:00:19       just that it's not aging as far as like decay, it's aging as far as information. Right? Like I was talking about like if you were. If people figure out a way to make humans live to be like 900 years old, would it be fucked up if you had sex with 50 year old people like you fucking asshole. She doesn't even know any better. It's only 50. She's basically a baby.

Speaker 4:          02:00:40       Did you treat him like that until they're 50 and say you're not an adult. I know. I know. You're 12. You can have a baby right now. Nature has said you are ready to actually procreate, but we've legislated that you can't be an adult until you're 18, so for the next six years we're just going to treat you like a baby.

Speaker 2:          02:01:00       That's an unnecessary burden for the boy and the girl and the lack of

Speaker 4:          02:01:05       you're, you're, you're, you're telling them every feeling that you have naturally is wrong. We're not going to explain that to you, right? Because we want to give you a good childhood. You shouldn't have to deal with all these adult. Well, that's what their body's telling them, so you better be honest or all of a sudden your kids fucking a 38 year old producer. Well, it's also

Speaker 2:          02:01:29       problem with like looking at children as being different than a person and it's like, no, this is mine. I made them. You are not going to like boys Michael, you, you're going

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       to like girls because you're a boy and you're going to carry on the Harris' name. Okay. I'm would, I would have a kid just for the longterm practical joke of raising him gay, lesbian, Youtube and say I was just trying to. Who just had a kid and know he's trying to pitch them this. Brendan, Brendan Walsh like, just go and just act like you're raising your kid gay and you know when you get older to men, meet each other and just say this to a baby. I think you could easily in this is gonna sound fucked up. I think you can easily convince a young kid that like, sex with males is normal if everyone's doing it. No, no. The idea was you have to still sex shame the kid. It's only okay to be gay once you're married, after you're 18, but you're gay, so these are doing. You're married to a girl or a guy. The end game is the kid has to eventually, when he's 18, come out as straight to his parents and that's a problem. If you have really progressive parents are like, dude, we got Super Street creds for you being gay. You piece of shit. Do you think you can be straight but trends you think you're willing to go there?

Speaker 3:          02:03:03       They'll sit down at the table of Progressive Brownie points. We were really happy about you being gay, Michael and you being straight is frankly, it's a big bummer to our social system. It's like they're going to think, here's what we're going to work at the law firm, they're gonna think we shamed you out of being gay and that's simply not the case. We have. It's so easy gel where we can sit here with white privilege. Yeah, we have. We're not like Sam Cedar Comedy Privilege, which we have in droves, which is way more way better diamond elite status than just white privilege. We have comedy privilege. It's true. They're just kidding. No, we're not, but it says comic. Okay. If you're going to get comfy about it. I was just kidding. And then it's all golden. Well, years clearly kidding, because you're not saying it's specifically in a form where they trying to disseminate information.

Speaker 3:          02:03:59       He try to be funny as well. So you'll say extreme things that don't necessarily represent your actual viewpoint just because you want it to be more hilarious. If Sam Cedar were funny all the time, rather than that one tweet who'd be fine. Sorry Sam. Brightmore. Jesus. It's true. But we have the luxury of having a social circle that is very tolerant to the n word degree tolerant in a green. Wait a minute. You can't say nigger word degree. Oh, that was yesterday. I. It doesn't even make sense. It sounds like a gratuitous use of the N. No, I was saying that in a green room when it's just comics nigger, retard con, diked fucking everything flies. Yes, and when it doesn't, you get super upset. Like if someone says, ah, she's a con, and someone goes, hey man, really shouldn't feel upset. What you say, you're a cunt to a feminist comedian in the confines of a Green Room.

Speaker 3:          02:04:59       Everyone's free and clear. It leaves the green rooms. I've been part of. Nobody has a problem with Yukon. Amanda Monacan? Nope. Not In the UK, but I mean even in America if you will, that the guy I've really as a con, right? Like, sorry, you looked immediately San again when you said that. I'm just, he's looking at me, he's not a and I'm just trying to bring them into the conversation. Like if you're, you mean pull him out of his fucking laptop a little bit, but you know, owns. We're all talking. We're friends. Like Saddam Hussein was a cunt. His kid would cons his kids. I heard there were cuts those sons. Nobody cares. You could say that the two. I don't know. He might've had other sons. I don't know if they're kind of shift. There were two cousins who was one of them, cuts. They apparently like would find people where they were getting married.

Speaker 3:          02:05:47       They would take the broad raper and then they would feed her two dogs. Well that's a little calendula. They were off the top evil over the top. Whoa. Yeah. I read that and I had to stop reading. I was like, okay, I can't go on with us. That's another thing about aging, not giving a fuck, but also giving more of a fuck. We were kids were the same age. We would watch all that faces a death. Couldn't get enough of it. Now I don't want to. No, no, I can't watch that shit. Did you try that Steve? You know, of course. Looking at it, I'm like, he cracked that. He's never going to drink it. Never going to drink it. So good. It makes my dick hard. Thing goes all sugar free and she, she, she used to like get a diet coke. We're going through a drive through diet coke and they pressed the little thing on the top of the to show you which one's diet, which ones? Regular check this to make sure because she knows how much I hate artificial sweeteners. Tea, I don't want to know because I don't drink that for the aftertaste. Never leaves your fucking mouth. Stevie is no different. Splenda, what's the sucralose? It's awful. If you just try this for me. If you're thirsty, diabetic and you pull up to the Wendy's drive through at 1:45 AM, what percentage of the time do you get a giant Vat of sugar?

Speaker 3:          02:07:13       If you like extra large diet coke. That's it. Okay. Don't at least one out of 100. You're getting Nevada sugar water, right? At least 100 mean. I'm assuming. It's kind of like in restaurants. They don't bring anything other than DECAF. After 8:00, I think the dude who's monitoring that thing is gonna slip on a of his own drool and slammed his head into the regular coke and it's gonna. Fill your shit up, but something that's going to give you a seizure. That's what I think. I'm going to fill that fucking thing up to the top. Very little eyes. Oh, this is where I was going. I fucking had a thing I was going to. Oh, this is about Hennigan. Yeah. Last year, a year ago. A little bit over a year ago. End of the world podcast. Oh know. I don't know if I've seen you once since then. I think we saw each other once you came to the store once you'd been back on here.

Speaker 3:          02:08:08       I think, I don't know, maybe maybe the end of the world podcast. I was not in a good place to say least, but I will tell you one thing that I said to all my friends, I said, I admire the fact that you push through it and even though you were like a little bit like flustered, you were still gregarious. I can't watch the video. I'm sure you were in a weird place. We tell everybody why, and my Gal Bingo had just gone into a possibly terminal. She had a seizure, fell down, smashed her head on the cement, life-flighted in a coma. She might not make it. If she does make it, it might be worst than not making it at all. And I said, uh, I didn't know how to handle that. Fuck, I didn't know either, but I made the decision since it happened during her 40th birthday party.

Speaker 3:          02:08:58       So all of our friends and family were at the house in [inaudible]. It happens. So she's surrounded by all these people who took a week off to be there for a five day party. They're there. I can't help her. She's in a coma. Me Standing with the family, staring at a half corpse is not going to help bucket. I'm going to do this thing. This is a big deal. And it was a huge. Them epic Douglas. Fucking amazing. We were there when Doug, Donald Trump was elected president and bill burr might've had the greatest podcast appearance of all time. It was like, it was like one of them, Michael Jordan, things that you would walk your kid and you're like, what the fuck? It's how he, his whole heckler youtube thing in Philly. That's him. And now he one upped it by doing the end of the world podcast fire.

Speaker 3:          02:09:50       It was on fire. I mean, he was on fire with a point where everybody's stepped back, except who was the gal that had a different Sarah? I don't know if it was all because of Brian Hennigan. Exactly. So this is where we're going because I wanted to name drop Olivia grace. She's hilarious. Fucking funny. She was like 17. Yeah, she's, she said she started once. She's 18 now she's 22. She just did a show up my house. They were just on tour that lend a. God dammit. I can't remember something Jewish. Uh, with the first name June with juicing. Oh No, they're on tour. Fuck, I'm sorry. Julie Guy. Julie. Julie. Uh, they were both funny. They showed up. Julie

Speaker 4:          02:10:35       goddamned look it up, find it somehow. Olivia grace's twitter, she's on tour. Olivia grades. So they come through, they had a night off and they stayed at the house and we forced them to do a show. Oh, it's sounds like great. I don't know if that was Thanksgiving or what. You forced them to do a show. Yeah. Well she's going to have to watch me jerk off in 20 years doing a show. Forcing someone to do a show is going to be the new rate. Eric Friedman, Eric Friedman, Julie, the first names. Not True. Anyway, they went up, so you have original soul rock Kenny go up and do rapid burst, so we'll have a little stage in our little fun house where we do our podcast that we. We can make it a show like that and it's always the best audiences. Never as a shell failed there.

Speaker 4:          02:11:19       They're always great because my house yet, but my. The people that come to my house, don't. They couldn't name their favorite comedian because they don't know. They'd go, Whoa, Jim Belushi, Zio comedian. Still they don't. They're great. They killed. She fucking crushed. Cool. What she told me, let's get back to the end of the world podcast. I had told Hennigan, yeah, we should probably have some kind of diversity. This is before that night deal. Well, now when we were planning it out, what it should be that night, I'm fucked my head. Is My lady going to live or die? Why am I here? I shouldn't have done this. Let's make the best of it. I go in the bathroom and the shower some for some reason they have a shower, the back of the comedy store and the Green. So stupid. I would go back there and I'd fucking fall apart crying and then I come back out on stage and try to keep it together. Well, Hennigan is still thinking. I told what we need women on this. It's all white men, so he's just. He has no discretion. He's just getting any woman and forcing her onstage and you're going, what the fuck? Why isn't I know that I was. No, no. You didn't know. You were saying why she. I go, I, it's probably my fault. I probably. Why your manager saying we need women. While that's probably. I probably said it, but uh,

Speaker 2:          02:12:50       here's the thing that's important. Most of the people that you had on that day is that, that stage, whether it's bill burr or whether it's Bert Kreischer or doug or me. Jeffrey showed up at his kid. That was the weirdest thing was that was weird. He came on stage with a little kid and we were like, hey man, you can't. You literally can't do this legally, like legally can't do this. I can't say it's okay to do this. We can't talk about the same things that we were going to talk in front of your kick and create. Like if you have your kid on stage and Doug wants to talk about anal vibrators and like it's the hardest he's ever come and the, the, the Gal was drowning and gagging, but it felt so good. He's like, how long does it take before

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       you can resuscitate someone with no brain damage? Like what if she blacks out from all the comments coming out because there's this vibrator back in front of his kid. I don't want to. Let me get the point and let's go back to this please, because Olivia grace, when she was down in Brisbane, she said she was there that night when Brian Hennigan was scouring the audience for female comics. She's lost. She's very boyish. She has a very short haircut. She's very boyish and he say, no, we need female comedians, comedians, and he, he tapped her and he went, not, you moved on. You're a piece of shit.

Speaker 3:          02:14:15       Olivia, if I did that, a discredited. If there's a better story, should have brought her out. You're fired anyway. From the production of the end of the world part two. Um, let's do another one when you want to do it. We have to find. I've been looking for it since you said that. Let's do in January was due at the comedy store in January and let's just find some random Tuesday. It bitch. Shut the fuck up. Who let this guy talk? It'd be good if you had somebody to swimming or some blacks. Do you have any people of color? We can visit the podcast, which. Oh listen, you're not adopted to America. You're influencing art. How dare you?

Speaker 6:          02:14:59       That's due to the nursery of the dod. Perhaps we should make this podcast comprised with. Sure. Sure. You just want to be in Islamophobia. It's gonna be on Youtube. Don't want to ruin the desert. New ideas in the middle of the desert. We need equal parts, vaginas and credences. Doesn't matter if one of you are. Come on. We got to avoid criticism at all costs. Last

Speaker 3:          02:15:48       I again, I take credit. I was probably the one who said it. No. Say it's my fault. I fucked up. I shouldn't talk to everybody beforehand. There was no option to talk to the security guards and said don't let anybody back here and no one gets on stage unless doug and I say yes. Tell Hannigan shut the fuck up. I know. Only from hearing secondhand. Even though I was there, I knew there was whatever that girl was. There was a Santana. Morgan Murphy was already. He's amazing. He doesn't look down on like Sarah Tiana too. I wasn't there when the issue happened, but she apparently had some issue and it was, it was a non. It was done. It was all not a humorous discussion. It was like a sincere know how bad it was that Donald Trump was going to win and how bad it was for women because it was right after the grab them by the Pussy video or audio.

Speaker 3:          02:16:38       So there was a lot of shit going on, you know, I wasn't there. I'd gone to the other room. I did a set in the or and I came back and everybody's like, Oh man, you missed his crazy blowout. But she and Bill Burr and Sarah Tiana. That's my point is that is not a negative or a deficit. If there's huge blown up conflict and the broadcast people. Actually that's not what we planned. You're right. People will click on it because they heard at some point there is a big blow out as long as we can keep Sarah Tiana off twitter for a couple of weeks. I definitely don't know or I don't want this to her, but I mean reading the people that had commented on it, like some of the people were like particularly fucking mean when they commented on it. I'm like, okay, okay. Everybody relax.

Speaker 3:          02:17:23       Bingo. Put out a book. It's not a book. It's a. She won her first mental institution stay when she was 50 1:50 against her will when she was hardcore. Crazy before we get together. She wrote like a Anne Frank Diary in the moment of what's going on and she put that out as a book or Anne Frank's diary and you know, Bingo. She's a soft touch and you can't read comments. Oh yeah, you're not strong enough people on the Internet. This is going to be someone who's a fucking ass hole, so just don't go there. She does. Eventually someone's going to be a fucking cock sucker and you're not going to be able to handle it. You're not like us. I have a hard to. I won't look at fucking youtube comments. I don't want to know. You know? Well, it's just not. Here's the thing. I wish everybody was cool and there's a.

Speaker 3:          02:18:20       there's an absolute reality when you do, you put out as much content as you or I or a lot of us is going to be some stuff that you like and stuff that you don't like and it's just going to be styles you like. There's certain people that don't like someone. Someone in the other day online. I showed a picture of me and Dave attell and they're like, fuck that guy. He's never funny. I'm like, Oh my God, you can exist. I'm not. I don't think you should die, but I can't talk to you. I just can't. I just don't. I don't know. I just, I got done watching David Tell for 20 minutes the Improv with a half a crowd and I was fucking literally crying it me to do comedy again. It was wonderful. It was a break. I got to be an audience member. It was amazing with somebody out there. It was like, fuck that guy. Does he? What did he say? Fuck. That guy was sitting next to me in that room that night, man. There's no way. There's no way. There was only like that might've been 60 people in that room and tell was destroying. I mean destroying. I was like, you can't say fuck that guy. If you watch that. It was so funny. I. It isn't often the case. I handled the steps

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       with Doug's audience. Do you hate headphones that are hurting my fucking ears? She gets can swap out fucking sweat. Is it the case that there's somebody who's like, one of Doug's fans who's like, I'm helping Joe by saying get rid of that guy because I just want to hear a few gaps. The problem with the last comic standing is people go, oh, you're a way better than so and so. It's not a competition, and should they do that in your face? But they'll do it to you. They'll walk right up to you and go so much funnier than that guy. The guy that you brought out of your own pocket because you thought that this guy should be known to your audience. They act like this opening act was forced upon, you know, I brought him out of my own pocket because I thought you would enjoy him and he needs to be seen and you're fucking.

Speaker 4:          02:20:25       I like that you do that. You do that. Like I do that. I think that's super important. You know, bring guys like Brendan Walsh out on the road and all these dudes you bring out and tell people about them. But that's a, that's a big part about this era as opposed to the old arrows is that I think this era is more supportive. There's more opportunities so people don't feel famine, you know, don't feel like, oh, we one guard can be the host of the tonight show. But that's not a thing anymore. Like if somebody offered me the tonight show, I'd be like, what do you want me to do? You want me to go and fucking talk about shit I don't want to talk about for like how, how, what do you think happens if you make more money? We didn't have Ferguson last night.

Speaker 4:          02:21:04       Ferguson, where the line is a segment where the riots took place. No, no. Craig Ferguson. We did his podcast last night and I told him, I go, I hated you when I first saw you because I don't watch late night. But if I was flipping channels and I saw you for a minute with your accent and getting your face into that like Fisheye lens thing he would do in his monologue. I didn't like you until I heard you on stern and I all of a sudden he was a human being for an hour and 20 minutes. He's a guy with good stories and he hated. He is like no one would accept the fact that he did not want to do anything else. They're offering them other projects. He's like, no, I'm, I'm good. I'm done. Well, you know, holly, we quit. Quit. I mean nothing. That's the greatest thing about his decision making.

Speaker 4:          02:21:53       Like he's like, I don't want to do this anymore. Now he does stand up and he just did a Netflix special and he's doing a podcast because he goes, I got to do something. I didn't want to talk, but I don't want to do it by their rules and no one believes when you don't have that Kinda half the through line of the book is when you, I want to do what I do, but no one buys that. You don't need to be more famous. I don't. I, uh, I did to plant little of eggplant and I don't like it. I know I don't want more

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       excellence. Delicious. With stevie on it, fucking eggplant Parmesan. One time my mother tried to make it and it was so grotesque that when she's saying you got to eat it, and then when she tried it, she goes, all right, I'll give. Give me all your plates. This came out bad. Sorry. Well maybe that's what it was. Maybe if you went to Trenton yonkers or something like that. If you don't like a little bit of fame, you know you're not going to like a lot. So it's not like. Well yeah, I think you like a little bit. Let's be a little bit and I think a little bit is good. I think it's all good as long as the numbers and manageable and you can stay yourself. I think the real problems when you go. Look, here's the best example, Michael Jackson who has never been a better example in the world of toxicity due to celebrity status.

Speaker 2:          02:23:15       Like you hit critical levels. You hit some three mile island shit. You hit some Chernobyl shit. It's impossible to maintain the amount of energy that's coming your way as a normal human being. I mean, you don't have any unique DNA that allows you to deal with the idea that 300 million people know who you are or more Jackson Swath of your clothing Dna out and put it in a petri dish and make a fucking cloning it and frame it and put it in their man cave and there's a bunch of people to think that maybe you're molesting kids and you've got to fucking amusement park in the backyard and you're literally losing your mind and you tell a guy, hey man, I can't sleep. I want you to analysts anesthetize me every night in a fucking tube. Just put, put me in some fucking crazy hyperbaric chamber and pumping the gas.

Speaker 2:          02:24:03       I mean, this guy was off the fucking reservation. There had never been anybody that famous before. He was literally the guy with the candle at the end of the universe going, oh my God, I think there's. Keep. See there's more room. There's no one's ever been here before. No one's ever been that famous. What happened? He went crazy. He went completely insane and died young and no, and nowhere between 1990 and 2017. Does it look like any of what's happened to him is manageable? It's like he's running down a hill, like tumbling down a hill and he's okay for the first decade. Maybe the first two decades. After awhile he's just getting chewed the fuck up psychologically. Physically he keeps getting more plastic surgery. I don't think he was ever very stable. Psychologic. Oh No, I don't think so either. I mean, I don't know, but if you ever seen that document around them, it's fucking love.

Speaker 2:          02:24:57       That documentary is the first time. This is it. This is it. Yeah, it's amazing. Earlier again, I don't know. Music to watch that you go, oh, this guy really didn't know what the fuck you was doing. I just don't get it. He was really brilliant. I just think the songs suck. Well they suck, but in terms of like what you want to hear right now, look, everything requires context. Right? Like if you were. Do you remember when I was a kid, and I remember this really clearly because I was in high school and I was living at home and I was listening to Debbie, a C O Z in Boston? No. W fnx. No, no way. Jose. That was right. WC O Z and Boston. It was a radio station in Boston in 19 eighties is rock and roll station and the guy came on who was a DJ.

Speaker 2:          02:25:42       I wish I could remember. It wasn't mark Parenteau who's like the big ones in the morning, but the guy came on. He played Michael Jackson. He played a Michael Jackson Song. Yeah, I think it was beat it and he said, look, I know this. No, he played Billie Jean. He goes, I know this isn't rock and roll because it's so good. I have to play. And he played it and he played billy Jean and I remember it was no twitter back their book and with this anchor music. Well not only that, this guy was a real dj. He was like one of the last of the real djs. They could literally decide, hey, I just heard this man Jack Umay. Yeah, this Lou Reed record that you fuckers have to hear from the beginning to the end. I want you to listen from the beginning to the end, so I'm going to play this.

Speaker 2:          02:26:27       You know, you hear Bruce springsteen when he was like 30, you know, like beginning to the end, you know, those days should do that. He used to sit there and listen and you'd be he that doesn't exist anymore like that and there's too many. This is one of the problems with money, right? There's problems with trademarks and the ability to put things on youtube and whether or not you can get credit for this or put that up, but that up like a radio station if just wanting to appear right now and pr and do like that kind of a thing. It probably be almost impossible. Like how many radio stations are there in the world where they would let you just play a whole brief bruce springsteen album from the beginning to the end. Terrestrial radio at this point

Speaker 4:          02:27:06       probably play child porn. Just soundtracks and no one's listening anymore. Do you still do like no uber in the morning when you have to promote a Gig? I don't have. I don't, but I miss some people. I Miss Kevin and being johnny dare in Kansas City. Ms Dot that guy. He's like, you didn't have to do it, but Johnny Darren, I have enough of the history. So when I went to Kansas City, I got there the night before. I said, all right, if I wake up at 6:00 AM, which I did, and we went down just for fun and we took over morning radio and Johnny dare in passing. He's like, he knows my house is all weird. So he's showing me pictures of his house and he's got all sorts of fucked up weird kind of things. And

Speaker 4:          02:27:56       what's his name? Patrick Mcgee. Oh, like, no. I go, uh, my, my tour manager Greg Jaylee does ghost ride. He goes to all this shit came from ghost ride. I go to the St Louis. Yeah. That's the second time now that a morning radio guy like Joe Rogan morning ready me, my hennessy's over their breeding Hennessy. Well, no, actually I was just checking up on it. I was just reading the comments and seeing if we should also start against bringing more diversity. I've got a few African students who would like to have in the studio for the record. Hennigan is not technically a guest. His name is Hennessy, but when, when Hennessy's wearing a guest on my podcast, he does the same thing. He'll sit there and fucking read your laptop while you're a guest. You can't do that shit, bitch. I just wanted to look at these. He was fine.

Speaker 4:          02:28:50       He was tweeting. Was looking at the uh, because I remember noticing this before somebody edited out the best of Bill Burr on the podcast election night as a standalone video. Yeah. It's got 900,000 views. Just the best of bilberry smashed it. He smashed it. It was so perfect for him because he had got his fucking held it up. It was awesome, but it was great to have all will keep coming in. Do you have a great lesson? You got it. You and I have been friends for so long. I knew what you were going through. I was like, I just don't know what to do. I didn't know how to handle it. I didn't know to joke around with. I was trying to bail a lot of it. Before the coma. I was saying, I don't. I don't think I'm the guy for the job. You're like, fuck you, you're coming to la.

Speaker 4:          02:29:37       So then when the seizure happened, I go, he's to think that her coma is an excuse, but I've always been a about Marilyn Manson backstage with a golf shirt on or something. Oh my God. He showed up. He showed up like the end of the movie flight, which is the best ending to a movie ever. That's the Denzel Washington where he crashes the plane, but he saves the entire crew like holly. Right? Last, but he was fine. He was jacked and fucked in the movie and at the end he's drunk as shit and John Goodman, his drug dealer comes in and fixes them with cocaine so he can testify it's the best ending of a movie or that movie. Watch the beginning and then fast forward through the fluff in the middle and get to the end and it's one of the best Madsen showed up where there's amy takedowns beginning.

Speaker 4:          02:30:35       They said our toad artois art. There's a giant picture in Johnny's house where I'm staring at this. It looks like Manson and I fuck Manson. As weird and unstable as he is is the only guy I can think of that would understand where I am right now, why I'm here, how fucked I am, what's going on, and I called him and he answered his phone, which he never answers his phone at 5:30 at night, which is morning for him and I told him what's going on. He said, I'll be there in 30 minutes, and he showed up with Krispy kremes and cocaine and each problem, and then he showed up and he sat backstage.

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       He wouldn't come out onstage and once were I was beckoning for to come out. That's when his management people caught wind of the fact that he's about to go out and his handler had to drag him away, but he saved my fucking life that night. Whereas fucking handlers, who knows we need to talk to them that tell them they'll be relaxed right now. Re lacks. Settle down. You're, you're handling Maryland motherfucking Manson. Okay. Alright. There you go. It's not Jim Nabors. Okay. You just lose one of them guys that are actually still doing rock and roll guy. Really doing it. God you. They just want to. What do they want to do? Keep him out of legal trouble. Keep them alive to get the fuck out of here. You need like a secondary version. You need to like, like guys who are lawyers who were on adderall and they report to the lawyers who are sober or give like two filters. You know, dudes like understand people on coke because they're basically on like some sort of synthetic coke and then you have a report like they have. There were like police body cameras and they report to the lawyers who are sober get drug tested every day. I'm like okay, what exactly was going on? And everybody be like, everybody has a say and they, they been count together and they go, what? How do we, how do we handle this? Well, we handle this by the fact that we're handling,

Speaker 6:          02:32:37       man, I'm fucking Manson. Let them do it. Let them go. Give him the gun. Gave him the rubber gloves by the rubber.

Speaker 2:          02:32:46       He's such a sweet dude. Yeah, he's a very nice guy. I met him a couple of times. He's always been very friendly, like genuinely friendly. Sorry I turned that on. I've got to show you a picture. I can't wait to tweet this right. That you shut off your phone like a gentleman. Plus, I like the fact that your phone makes us starting noise from 2006. What is that? One of them sound and Samson used to bust my balls because I was the last guy with a flip phone. So depressing and you'd have all the new gadgetry and I was so proud to have a flip phone, but when we started working in the UK, nobody calls everyone only texts because I guess phone calls, cost of fucking thousand pounds a minute or something. So I had to actually get a smart phone, but I still long for the flip phone days will samsung just came out with a new phone that's a hybrid.

Speaker 2:          02:33:39       It's a combination of a smartphone and a flip phone and you open it up and you can get an actual keyboard and he talked to people just like a regular flip phone and when you're done you hang it up and the front of the phone is a Bezel. Lists smartphone. So the front of the phone? Yeah. Like you could do text messages, you can view the Internet and then when you want to open it up and make phone calls that acts like a regular old school flip phone and people really like it. In terms of like pressing physical buttons. Yes. Yeah. Have you seen you watch a movie on your fucking smart phone? I know people that have a busy, they don't have cable. That's why football is popular at my house because no one has

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       tv so they can't watch it unless they come to my house. But I know people that watch, they'll just sit and watch an entire movie on a phone. Right? I can't watch it on a 32 inch screen. I. I need a big fucking screen and watch a movie. Yeah. I think 100 percent. And I go. The only time that there's that phone, the only time is when you're on a plane or something, you're trapped and all you have is your phone. Look at that phone doug. Look at that screen. So the front of it is 60 inches. That will be an awkward phone call. You can't carry that around Bro. You don't even understand inches, bro. That's a the size of like an iphone six or some shit. Actually it was a little bigger than that. Doesn't jammies with how big is it? Is a big screen. I had it on another page. This is when I had to decide which picture goes in the book in which doesn't cause there's too many dick pics. I deleted this and put in the me pulling my dick out in front of Louis Ck. But I can't wait to tweet this. Let me see that. I have to apologize. I was wrong. You touched it wrong. I didn't touch you that Jesus Christ his angry. By the way, this is a bad touch. Touch Rogan. GotTa ramp. The thing up here. Yeah, we. Are we out? Are we going towards A.

Speaker 3:          02:35:35       Yeah. I pulled my dick out in front of her, but what about the three or four people in between? Everybody seems okay with it. Yeah. That was back when I was kind of my thing. Sarah Silvermans there. She's now. That's the ask. Did you ask first? No, no. I was vacation telling them picture I was fluffing. But are you prepared for shame? I'm, I'm ready for it. You might get it. You wouldn't have to get this. Um, is there a place where people can view this or is it a good example? I was going to tweet it. Hmm. Let me talk to you about this. All right. Let's wait. Let's wait. I've got somebody said, Sarah Silverman. Well, Sarah Silverman is a friend and a wonderful comedian and a colleague and I think you and I both respect her as I do. I don't think that's what I didn't want her to get into any trouble because she wrote a, is it okay to love Louis ck thing?

Speaker 3:          02:36:19       Is it okay to love? Here's me with my dick out. Here's the thing. It might not be anymore. This is why we need to burn that. You need to burn your whole phone. You need to get modern phone that allows you to take photos and get online and then you need to burn that thing because you can't. Can't have those pictures. You can't have those pictures floating around. It's important, man. I'm sorry. I was the guy that put it out. It's so sad. Those are. Those are developed pictures from a photo mat. I think it's gonna take a little time, but once, once we get through this we're going to find some sort of a reasonable, a agreement where when you can and cannot pull your dick out because what we needed to do when people are young boys and girls install a small, like a, some sort of a sexual equivalent to a Turkey tester or something like a, like a green light, you know, like acting like goes off like, okay, you can pull your dick out now sir, like I'm 23 years old, I'd be going to college, but that sex would pull your dick out.

Speaker 3:          02:37:18       It's when you're our age that's inappropriate. Unless they're our age two, which you know what, there's no 50 year old comics hitting on 50 year old women, which is a maybe. But like what if it's a woman like Christie Brinkley, she's like 63. She's still hot as fuck. Well then you go, oh my God, I'm your age so I know who you are. Unlike young men, you're just happy to be there. You don't pull your dick out. I wish I did this years ago when it was erect. How many people would be mad if a woman pulled her vagina out? Almost zero. Right? Like who would feel threatened? That's the real problem. The real problem is the physical violence potential and the number of people that have been raped. That's the real problem because it was just about weird sex. Things like, well, this is an which is the bit that has been working on is the difference between hot as fuck. Take it or leave it.

Speaker 3:          02:38:13       Come on, bitch. Christie Brinkley does not live a human life in perfect lighting with perfect makeup. You don't need the dark ones with no. At some point she's hunched over like I am with this posture, wearing reading glasses thicker than ours. Trying to focus on something on a laptop and that spill bellies hanging over cunt because eight kids came out of it. That's when you both put on mascot masks like you are the squirrel and she's the raccoon and you guys just fucked by the firelight. Just get right in front of that God damn fireplace and go to town, molly and overrated because it leads to all these problems. Certainly can. It certainly can lead to a like a weird unofficial bond with people, right? Like if everybody. Imagine this, if, if like hugging people if like committing to hugging people was like as intimate as community to having sex with people.

Speaker 3:          02:39:17       Well hugging people is really quick and no one says, oh, he hugged too soon. He, I was. I was. I was hoping it was going to be a long hug, but his hug was done like in seconds like he was a teenager and his first hug, like the man does not have the right to pull out of the hug before the woman wants to end the hug like the period. We all know this. Can you hug twice in a night? No, no, don't do it. Because the second hug will be unenthusiastic and not representative of your soul who you are as a spiritual being. You need to only hug fucking once a week. Once asked someone you love. Porn has changed the game. Porn has ruined fucking and it's continuing to ruin. Fucking like that. It's just setting you up for robot. Fuck dolls. Have you seen that stripper?

Speaker 3:          02:40:09       A robot that gyrates on the. On the, uh, the pole. There's a robot that goes on the stripper pole and it's clearly a robot. You see all the mechanical parts, but it's moving his ass like some beautiful woman with a perfect ass. You okay? Okay. Like we are so close to not being able to tell. Like I don't know if we understand what exponential increases in technology are. Look at this. Lead this robot. She's gyrating on this poll. So she's holding this pole. Okay. Well right now you could see your joints and all that stuff and I know she's done a human even though she's wearing high heeled shoes. How many more years do we have before that is fixed, but how, how, how often did you need that? You went to see strippers because you wanted the threat of getting pussy. You didn't need her to spin around a brass pole.

Speaker 3:          02:40:56       If she was just there vacant, robotic and ask a sleigh and Akimbo you just fuck her, you wouldn't go, I need you to dance. I need to want it more. All that does is make you want it when you didn't want it to begin with. Oh, I didn't think about fucking till she did all that thing on the brass poll. Now I have a boner, now I'm using that as my leader. Do you know what I'm saying? Not particularly thinking about fucking Brian. And then there's a girl dancing around a brass pole. Cidex shaking her ass. So now I have a boner. Now I'm thinking about fucking where I would've just talked to you. Well, for girls just sitting outside, reading a book, not thinking about fucking and Jason Momoa shows up and he's in an open shirt, like some sort of cis guy that you fantasize about.

Speaker 3:          02:41:46       Game of thrones, put them on and his. He's chopping wood. Travis with his name. Travis. Jamie. Jamie's tropic chopping wood with a giant ax and the girls get all juicy. Just looking at him because he's perfect. That's him. Shut the fuck. Come on. I was going to say with a nipple ring, but that was the cursor. Come on. It's a handsome man and he's a very friendly too. I met him at whole foods. You're not, as you say, he's not because you're not a woman, by the way. It's about six visits. Baseball player. What's his name from the nationals? The most beautiful men in sports. I was called Jason. Uh, Joe, just the guy with the big beard from the nationals. He's fucking biking, but that guy's a muscle bound. You're in a weird dudes. I'm going to have to. Is the girls like worth worth with an e, W, e r t h?

Speaker 3:          02:42:37       That guy is fucking gorgeous. It's not a competition is. It? Is. It is what I want to have an issue with Jason Momoa. We're gonna end this podcast with a twitter. A bit like invite ladies because we both have 80 percent male fan basis. More than that. I went and I went on instagram. It looks Jason Worth. Okay. I'm with you. That's the one. The one you just touch and that's the one was traps. Fucking that guy. I've been able to get naked photos of base ball bat a giant one, not even one of those ways. We give out for free for ladies listening. Jason Werth or Jason Momoa. Oh, I'll battle of the Jason. Jason's. Listen, it's just a matter of like, what do you want to do? Do? Do you want to live in a margin or do you want to live on the beach and raise your kids in the sand? Okay. You gotTa pick your poison. I have no idea how he came over on the fucking raft. Like he's some kind of Polynesian. God. He's from Hawaii. It's like six foot of the most expensive state to live in. Only for one refuge for white people. You're not even paying attention to. You want me to. Islands are on Hawaii pro, so racist five.

Speaker 3:          02:43:50       Sorry. Is this a bonus question? Do you smell like smoke enough that you're going to get in trouble when you get home? How old are your kids now? Seven and nine for the young ones I forgot. Uh, uh, uh, daddy smells like cigarette smoke. I've got shirts here that I could change, but it's good that you did this, you chain smoke through this because we realized this system sucks. Yeah, I noticed that. Or whatever is making the system. I've been breathing it. I definitely got a secondhand nicotine high. It should be cold to in the air. Just good. We'll get a call. Jason Dill. Tell me before you showed them, hey, you got to think like a bar, a bar. Don't think like your grandma smoked in occasionally in the bathroom. He said, I said, did Rogan put this system in specifically for me? And he goes, I think so.

Speaker 3:          02:44:39       Definitely for you and dice clay you tell to tell. Yeah, he's another one. I can't live without. The cigarettes were outside and just keeps going. He's just had five days off of them coming into this. Did you really for five day quit everything for five days except medicinal drinking. Do a couple shots of whiskey because at this point can't quit cold Turkey. Very dangerous. Broadly understand. So now when you, uh, what was harder, um, what does it feel like to take five days off of cigarettes? When I do it my way, perfect. Fantastic. Because I.
