Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Here we go. Three, two, one fucking year. Philippe. How are you sir? Was so full. Good man. You have to have him have to say that. I don't know. It seems like it has. Like you said, what's up dude? And then you said what's up fool? You corrected yourself. I'm slipping. Was that like when you have such a cool saying like you do, you almost feel compelled to use it? Yeah, it all started like people in my neighborhood would answer the phone like that. I was dating this girl and I called her up and her brother. I sort of porn with self pool. That's normal, right? Yeah. That is a, a, a cool Mexican thing to set. No, probably more like the hood. More like the west coast Hoodie, west coast hood. That's not necessarily central Mexicans and blacks. Like we took it from the blacks.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       Oh, okay. But it mostly like a west coast, south central east La Boyle Heights. Boyle Heights in the house. Yeah. What? That's, you know, this is a contentious time for fucking people when it comes to like, um, Mexicans and Americans with this whole wall thing. Yeah. And I, I went to, I went to go, um, to look at the walls because they went to Mexico and I was like right at the border of the gate, like the gate, it's not a wall to the gate. And across the gate they have like eight wall prototypes, like the ones, like eight wall prototype. Like there's one wall that's like a, it's a wall was the man and it has um, concrete. Then there's another wall that's different. And then another one, it's like they have, you know, when you, when you go buy title for her house. Yeah. And they show you all the tiles. Oh Wow. The Hook. What the wall is like little home depot. Yes. But like a sign, like a placard with different. Wow. Look at that. That's it. I was reading, I was there. I was right in front of that. Each one of those, I think it costs $25. Million each wall each. Yeah. What? Someone's getting robbed. This subcontractors right now in New Jersey going, wait, wait. Hey. Hey, what the fuck? I could do that for 30 grand.

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       Anytime you have a wall. Historically. Shit goes down, right? People want to get over that wall. It's natural. People want to get out, people want to get out, but you want to get in going to be tall. And here's what the craziest shit about the wall. I'm sure you've seen where it goes into the ocean. Yeah, I was there. Like how are you going to stop people from going around that? That is the silliest thing ever that is like having this gigantic wall that is like having like a gigantic, huge impenetrable boundary. But on one side there's just like a door. Yeah. That's a door. You go right around. That may be hard to bring all your shit. So what happens?

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       These guys right there on the Mexico side and those guys over there on the California side like that is the weirdest shit ever. Play volleyball with each other. Do they really? Wow. The added another piece to that wall right there. So that was an old wall. See that? The construction of the wall that I saw now. Yeah. Wow Man. He can still swim. But uh, as soon as you swim, you know the part of the postcards and come get you. That is so crazy. Just what, what a strange. And people go, you don't want a wall. Relax. I hadn't said any of that. Not saying that. I'm saying just look at this just as a, use your brain. Just look at this objectively and see how bizarre it is that there's a gigantic physical boundary to keep certain people from going into a certain area. I mean, I, I think that that one day that has to not be a thing anymore. Right? Wouldn't you say

Speaker 2:          00:04:05       that is a crazy thing to justify? Like you can't come to the good spots. Like the good spots are limited. Well, if they, we let people in and there'll be no more, no more good spot. It'll be just like the bad spots. That's the, that's the fear. And here's the thing, man, that ain't not uncommon. That's not a, it's not an imperfect. It's not a fear that's not totally illogical either. Right? Like you would be worried if you lived in a sweet place, like a name of a city. Not Too many people perfect size boulder, Colorado. We have orders. Cool. Yeah. Nice. What if a million more people moved into boulder?

Speaker 2:          00:04:49       Now all of a sudden it's a million 100,000. You're like, what the fuck? What the fuck is this? He can't go anywhere now. Everybody's rude. People start getting antsy. That the way they drive that drive faster. That's what happens. Be More more gangs. Why do you fix that? That's how. That's what we need to fix. Not like whether or not there's a wall he fixed. How do you fix people from getting crazy? I know man. They shoot on later boulder, Colorado Party. We'll have a subway system to get other people off the streets. Yeah. Yeah. If they did, if they did have a couple million people moved, they're like, Bam, start moving shit and sentence. She would change radically. That's what happens to places. You get too many people. They just fucking change. It's a. it's still strange. Fuck. See a wall. It is to house. I'm not saying that I can, but it gets so big. It's so right when he left with a bad. What'd you just take two comedy? Yeah. All I'm saying is it's weird. It's fucking weird. It seems

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       to be something that should be perhaps reexamined this idea of like, it's almost like we have weird parents that we have to listen to for our whole life and that, those parents with the government. I know, like when I was a little boy I would live in Mexico and um, my mother, she to tie me up to a stump so, so we'll run away. Holy Shit. That glaze to follow my dad to work every day. My Dad was like a, I think he was like a steel worker or something. He worked on a lathe. So he worked with metal at the time. Yeah. And I will follow him to, to work everyday because I was a little kid I guess, and they couldn't. I will run away every day and my mom would tie me up to a little street store with a rope. I was her pet, basically. Jesus Christ. Holy Shit. That's a weird memory. I know, right? That I lived in. Um, I remember I lived in Mexico for a little while until I was three or four. Then my dad took off. Do you remember Mexico at all? I remember a bathroom was outside

Speaker 1:          00:07:07       like an outhouse and we have to use a flashlight to go outside and wow. I remember mosquitoes everywhere and my mom's family are living in like in one big ranch with different houses and it was fucking dusty. I mean it was dusty. I was living in Mexico and they used to be a truck that will water the ground everyday because it was too dusty and there was no cement. But then my dad took off to the United States and we followed him. We came here. We were living in Tijuana, Mexico for about two years. Do you remember how you get through? Yeah, we met with my dad, made it through first, started another family then came and got us now. But that's what I thought. He was gone for a long time man. And then we, we went, we were living with my aunt, her name was Julia and she lived in Tijuana, Mexico, right next to that.

Speaker 1:          00:08:05       Where that, where that gate is Polonia Tsa was up and um, we, we went across with a, you know, a smuggler. My mom pay them money and we got in his car. Wow. We crossed and we made it through. I remember we made it through, but there was like a checkpoint back in the day in San Clemente, California. The California Sheriff Department will just, the county sheriffs, they will randomly stopped cars, you know, like too many people in one car and his car too heavy. So they got us and they put us in there like in a holding cell. My mind went one way. We went the other way. Oh. And how old were you? I was probably four maybe or five. I remember there are three, three little brothers. I have my little brother was like three in the other one was one or two. Why would they separate you from your mom?

Speaker 1:          00:08:58       Um, I don't know. That's, I guess that's how they process web backs are illegal people. That seems kind of crazy. She went to one when, I dunno what I'm, I don't remember crying or being scared. I just know that we're watching cartoons, you know, American cartoons, that's all you remember. And then they caught us. We, we, we went back again and they cut it again in another car and we got separated again. But this time we were held for a longer time and I remember my aunt, when she saw us in Mexico, she said, hi, they catch you guys again. Just jokingly. Wow. But the third time was like my, my aunt and my mom came up with this crazy idea because we have brothers. We had cousins in Sunny California and my mom said, you know, why don't we just borrow their passports, you know, to cross.

Speaker 1:          00:09:54       And I don't remember this. I just found out recently that what happened, my brother told me, my little young brother, um, we just almost like a little girl, like a full on little girl. Um, because at the we had like three passports and two were boys. One was girl and we took straws to guests and my mom and my aunt, they forced my little brother to be a little girl. How they make him look like a girl, they just, my little girl for two weeks just to play around, you know, they give them a fake name and so and so. And he was playing dancing no more dancing, getting ready, playing with Barbie dolls. And so he was preparing, preparing broke deniro, bro. Wow. Getting ready for that row of his life. Wow. How old was he? He was two at least, or three man. He was young.

Speaker 1:          00:10:52       Wow. We crossed and we made it all the way. And um, I remember that um, some other car picked us up. We jumped into another car right away and then we jumped in another car and then that car drove us to, to southern California. We were lacking content somewhere. And Carson, we're in a house that had the. It was, it was funny, it was like a, it was like a hub for illegal immigrants. Like everybody there was going different places. Okay. Who are you going to go to? St Louis. This guy, you're going to go to San Diego. That lady, her three kids, they're going to go to boyle heights because that's where the father is. So that were granted boyle heights, um, didn't speak no English at all. But um, I picked up English right away, you know, because your little like watching bionic woman and Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:11:47       $6,000,000 man, incredible hulk dukes of hazard. So you basically picked it up from TV. We'll be like, what kind of, what kind of lessons did you take? Lessons were in English or none. Zero. When I was, when I was in elementary school, it was different from now. There was no, like separating these kids who don't speak Spanish have put them in an English as a second language class. I started, I started kindergarten, so. So you just picked it up? I picked it up. The teacher, the teacher never spoke Spanish to us. She never said I'm okay Hawaiian, you know what apple is? That it wasn't nothing like that. It was time. It was like, I don't got time for you. You're going to pick it up or not. Do you think it was because you were. You were so young. Your brain could pick up another language really quickly.

Speaker 1:          00:12:39       Isn't that what they say? Like young people, their brains pick up languages quicker. I think I picked it up really fast, but to my pronunciation we're not there. Right? Like I didn't know how to stay bionic. I will say in that kind of makes sense, right? That a part of your brain would really develop and make it real easy to learn a language when it's real young, you know, like, okay, how do I say this? What do I give more of? A desperation for figuring it out, but I bet you a little kid that comes from another country like you did. Well, you're a perfect example. You learned from TV. That's crazy. So you learned from just talking to people that are around you and television, television. Nobody's saying this is how you say this is a pronoun, this is a Noun, a verb. Not telling you any of that.

Speaker 1:          00:13:23       Nobody told me that, but later I had a cousin who lived in Santa Paula and she taught me that stuff like, this is how you say this word because her and I were playing. We'll play like school together. Yeah, or she'll give me assignments that were just should pretend to be a teacher. Then a read. You know what man? For little kids, that should be fascinating. Learning how to speak like, but for whatever reason we decide that it's boring. Like learning a language. It's like, ah, it's so much work. I've got to read another book. Fuck that. Fuck, fuck up another book report. Give you now to come on man. Just get Rosetta stone. I'm like, imagine trying to learn Chinese. Like what are you saying? I'm going to learn how to read it too. I could read that stuff and and say, oh, how much time would that take?

Speaker 1:          00:14:13       That would be crazy. I took German in high school at for like a whole year and I did an eight class but I didn't learn anything. See, for me, I think everything gets super squirrely with, with unusual, like languages. They use things other than our letters. As soon as you use things other than our letters, like you see Russia and you're like, ah, what? What the fuck is that? Shit? They have totally different. Like ways of using our letters pull up some like Russian pull up like Russian translation, like Russian tab. There's they got wise in there and

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       yeah, it's a champ. It's such a powerful language. It looks like almost like Viking runes or something like that. Sometimes like Braille. That's a crazy, crazy looking language like um, another one is Arabic, Arabic crazy. Look in language when they go to that. What the hell is that man? That's the way it is. You'll see in the movie Indiana Jones. What is that thing that looks like a, like a spade with a knife through a tart take right there. Stay at the hotel, right. That like what does that call Krillick they call it Krillick. Okay. Look at the language. Like look at it. When you see it written down, we'll get that weird double k thing. K Left K, e Dot k cave. Look at that one. They'll be folks here at crown to watch a Russia willow fortunate give you the six. But they have our letters too, but they're backwards.

Speaker 2:          00:15:51       Like look at it, look at that. Again, this almost like look how they have ours. But they have a backwards capital are what never backwards, lowercase, and then it looks like that's insane. Like look at that, you that you were the big Dick. What does that does? You have the big Dick and these ecu with two dicks. The Chair? Yeah. This is a fascinating language. RSP. SSC. I think if we lived on another planet and we were looking, we were observing a giant culture that had nuclear power, but they all hadn't even agreed on the same language yet. We'd be like, what are these crazy assholes do? What are they doing? They're all speaking different. They can understand each other. They all have nuclear power and they can understand each other. So you're relying on translators and people to speak for you and representatives. And I know men. Oh, I watched that movie. Clothing. Cultural for the first time on mushrooms. Whoa man, man. Dude. And you read about communication with the community, with the UFOS and hook thing.

Speaker 2:          00:17:00       Dude, dude, dude do. Didn't they have like a hand thing? Yes, we would do with it. That was amazing. I was wondering like what if like humans always think that they know what the other person might be saying, right, but what are the whole time you're like detonating a bomb with each other. They add, but the problem is like what they're saying means different things in different cultures too. It's just hit on earth. People just have different styles of living. You can't tell them they're wrong in Africa or the right Norwegia Norwegia region. What does. Nor we'd. Norway, Norway. How funny is that in Norwegia I'm coming up trying to come up with a cold weather. I was in the middle of Iceland. I should've went with Iceland, Iceland, but any place like that, these

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       freezing climates. Who's right, who's, I don't know who's right, like teenager, we had a guest on our podcast. He said that he said that will never performing. He said that they were spitting at them and he will. Why the experience you because of how they say we love you in Argentina when you're performing like they spit at you, that people do weird shirt used to it. Right? How about, uh, in Iceland they eat this crazy shark, it's like a, a fermented shark and it's supposed to be disgusting for everybody else, but them, like they love it. It's like a delicacy. It's this for an in Bordain, aiden, and he said it was discussed at the bunch of people have eaten it on TV shows and shit and been like, what the fuck can assure you that for some kind of fermented shark, Iceland people are some strong fucking people.

Speaker 3:          00:18:45       Man. Those people live in Iceland. Just think about how hard you have to be for the huge man I seen. I seen a video then working out. Yeah, there's like a disproportionate number of the world's strongest men have come from Iceland. Big Ass pot, bunch of giant motherfuckers, a lot of fucking beer to drink. Whatever the fuck they want. Those are vikings, man. That's what's leftover. That's what's leftover. The Vikings back before guns, it's like that just ran through villages, man Motherfucka and those are the last remnants. Once people started developing guns, then it became a fair fight and then it's like, oh, okay. Before that, man, the Viking showed up. You were Foxville. That was no Bueno. So heavier to giant swords if they were all, if like the whole, there was an actual country filled with people as big as those strongest men guys and they decided to just take over.

Speaker 3:          00:19:46       There was no guns. They just take over. That's how it works. Arrows aren't not good enough. Catapults not good enough. So that was him in the legs. That's good. It's always good to have a little hyenas brody's away for them motherfuckers. What do you think it would be like if everybody spoke the same language? Do you think if the world spoke one language, things would be better or would find other shit to hate each other for sooner or later somebody will make a little language. Yeah, you're right. Like we're not going to call him Mike. We're going to call him shit head. Okay. For Fun. Right? Like especially if people get to Controli with the language soon as people do. Don't say that word. Don't say this word. As soon as people get controlling with the language, like let's make our own shit. Like I was called problematic one time for what would you do? I was just a did a show and um, the lady went on and he goes, oh, he's problematic. He's um, what did he say? He messed

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       my shoulder with the word male chauvinist. Yes. Yeah, because I just did, was a joke, but she heard like the trigger word against seven, set her off. So I guess she didn't hear that. She didn't wait for the punchline. I found that happened, but it's weird like the lady you should understand, you know, you went, you walked into my show, you know, with your friends. They should have warned you that I say words, but you gotta wait for the fucking punchline, bitch. Yeah, there's a turn coming up here hanging there. Like I remember doing this show and I was just talking about my brother coming in and out of prison a lot and they booked me for the show. It wasn't that much $200. And I told my friend, this comedian that I had worked with named Steve Flies fucking dirty. I sort please just be clean for 10 minutes please.

Speaker 1:          00:21:37       No surprise is brought up. Pull your pants down, just a quick eight if you have it. So he did a quick eight, 50 solid. Killed it. I went up there. It was doing okay. I started talking about um, whatever stretch marks. This is that. Then I said my brother had been in prison a lot. Every time he comes out worse, the first time he came out, a better thief. The second time he came out racist, like total racist. I'm Mexican guy. And then the third time he came out even worse, man, he came out of a born again Christian. The tumor away from me. She didn't wait for the punchline. He don't steal no more. He blesses himself so you know, and then she just took the microphone away and the Fat Lady and she said, that's enough for Mr. Parsa

Speaker 2:          00:22:24       so crazy. They don't let you say that. She says thinking how foolish that is to stop you from saying that like, this is a problem. There's a problem that people have. They feel righteous. When you're talking about standup comedy in particular, when you're setting up a joke like that, you're gonna you're, you're taking him for a ride. They don't know what you're gonna say next. You know, and it's funny and to pretend that it's not funny because it's talking about a certain subject, it's just crazy because it's not about not being able to talk about subjects. It should be like if someone has a heinous perspective, like, hey, I don't have a problem with kids, get raped and killed, and they start trying to make a joke about that. Park a fuck man, good luck. You're on your own. You know you have a obviously heinous perspective, but that's not a heinous perspective.

Speaker 2:          00:23:14       What you're doing, talking about a guy going to jail and getting worse every time it comes out that that's also a reality. It is. It is a reality. And to pay for people to deny that people become hardened criminals because they'd been in the joint three, four times that joint. What am I living in the fifties? I'm going, come on, man. That's crazy. To deny that you're in there with fucking criminals and you know you're stuck in a cage, of course you're gonna come out worse. That's where it's fucked up, right? It's like nobody's getting any better at doing that. No. No one ever re-engineered the whole prison system. No one ever re engineered the whole people system and looks. He goes, why? Why don't we just continue to have crime emanate out of these unfortunate areas. If you just fix those areas, fix it.

Speaker 2:          00:24:02       You. Is it possible that you could have no like extreme poverty on earth? Is it possible? Do we have enough resources? Do. Does anybody know? Like do people think that in order to live the way we live now that somebody somewhere has to live in extreme poverty? Is that like what they think or is it just a, a spot where stuck at? Well, I'm, I think I'm the only one that will happen if nobody really. It would just be middle class and poor than everybody will have something. Yeah, because cause I know it's just rich and middle class and poor. The rich would have to give half to the middle class in the middle cloud to give to the poor Jesus. Not enough money to go around. Sorry. Yeah. Is that. Is that real? Like if you had all the resources on new resources, people to volunteer, man, volunteer for what?

Speaker 2:          00:24:54       To help people like you. Okay. You care about dogs so much? I don't see your work doing. Putting it in eight hours and no shelter. Walking these dogs for free. What does it say? Billionaires make so much money. Last year they could end extreme poverty seven times. She says, where's the profit in that? Oh my God, that is crazy. Roughly six out of the seven, the top 500 richest people. Southern network. The net wealth created this year is a staggering 259 point 4 billion here. The top five richest people who saw massive gains is here. Oh boy. Jeff Bezos in the house, CEO of Amazon $35 billion to his net worth this year. Holy Shit. I don't know how to say this gentleman a ever grants chairman. Background grew $25 million. Yeah. These guys are fucking making Bernard Baby. What's his name? Barnard what? Barnard? Looking at cash baby. Twenty 4 million Zuckerberg Zuckerberg in the house.

Speaker 2:          00:25:57       $4,000,000,000 money. Woo. Yeah, there's some. But here's the thing, man, if you're going to have a game, and I'm not, I'm not advocating for capitalism or communism or socialism. Not Advocating for anything. What I'm going to say, if you. If you're going to have a game and you're trying to figure out what, how much of a certain thing. And if you own that thing, you could do way more stuff, right? You could buy a private jet to get a big house. So what is it? What are the, what are the steps you have to take in order to get that thing? And is there a too much? Could someone have all of it and everybody else has zero. Is that possible? What if there's like there's no rule that says you have to do something with it either. Like you could just

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       collect it all, burn it, but that'd be an asshole move. But in every game there's rules. Technically. There's no rule here that says Bayzos couldn't just when it. For sure for sure. No, I'm not. I'm not saying. What I'm saying is, is it possible that someone could get to a point where they have all the money? I mean, if this has happened before what jp Morgan had other money, it was really. Yes, I saw that, that Dr Ritu the men who built America at one time he held, he held a monopoly and all the steel in the world. Well, one thing that people really resist is if you try to make new money, you know, that's why people are like really edgy about bitcoin. You know, what the fuck's going on? This is their own real money. They're buying houses with bitcoin. People are selling houses with bitcoin.

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       Oh, to a bitcoin. Listen man, in this day and age with the kind of trust that people have in government and government decisions when it comes to economics, that bit point stuff, any crypto currency stuff becomes more and more interesting to people because they go, these crazy fuckers aren't fixing nothing, man. Well now when I was living in a while, I grew up in a Pico Aliso people gardens, at least we'll build housing projects. We had a, we have, we let our, my mom didn't have money in a bank for at first our neighborhood and have money in the bank. So they started their own little bank. Like we had this thing called a, I don't know how to say it in English called Dina. We get like I guess 10 families that we know and every week somebody puts $100 in the pot. So there's 10 of us and everybody puts a $100 and we all take turns every week collecting the pot.

Speaker 1:          00:28:34       So you and I in him and seven other people were putting in $100. That's a thousand dollars. So that way this week Joe Rogan gets it and next week everybody puts it $100 again. And this time he takes it, he gets 100,000 dollars and then the next week I get a thousand dollars to everybody makes a thousand dollars. So that would be like the way we used to learn each other out, money in the hood. It works hard on the, on the honor system, but it works out. It never works out. It always failed because usually like if one guy really what do they want to pay? Something will happen, know it'll look bad on his family in Mexico or we'll go hunt that food down. But I used to do that with what I used to be the guy that used to collect all the money from these people when I was a little boy.

Speaker 1:          00:29:20       I was like 12, 13 years old. Walking in the neighborhood was a thousand dollars in cash and passing it to this house. But no one knew that. But there's this whole, this is how money marketing worked in the neighborhood while everybody was borrowing for somebody could no weapon alone, a thousand dollars. Right to. That's interesting man. That's a. that's a really cool way to handle it. That's a cool game. Like our social game that everybody's playing with each other. That's a cool way to do it. I'm not, I'm, I'm in commerce. Could do it if they got together. Oh fuck you. You can't pay a rate. Okay. If 10 people put $100 each, that's a great idea, man. That's a great idea. And just pass it around. That's a fucking great idea, man. That's something that's a social security that you'd be happy to contribute to get a group of your friends and do that.

Speaker 1:          00:30:13       That's super smart because then you get these little bursts of a big chunk of money. Yes. Yeah, man, I like it. That's a social thing too, right? Yeah. I don't know who came up with it, but we have a social thing. Do you know, it's something that keeps people communicating with each other and talking about shit and getting excited about it. That's bad ass man. He was a hustler man. My mom sewed. We used to go to um, because I live in boyle heights and we're next to Delta Lane. There's so many, so, so many fucking factories. And my mom knew she was just, you know, like where everything was. We used to go to this one factory and this trash can, we'll throw in a trash can. I in the band it was nothing but I'm synthetic cotton, so it was like this fake carton made of plastic. We have to take it out of the trash and put in hefty bags. They were my would will go home and my mom was sold me pillowcases and we'll sell pillows. Wow, that's hilarious. Dude. You had a crazy life.

Speaker 4:          00:31:21       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:31:25       I couldn't imagine. How did the the little boy do pretending to be the little girl. How did he do when he went to jail, Bro? He was sucked into it. Who Do you think that he would have been gay either way. You never know. Is it possible that wow, maybe it was just gay. Maybe that's why they chose him. My brother fought like I had this joke. I heard this story for many, many years but didn't know how to. How to put it out there. Then my brother, he told me, hey, you should do that. Joke about how he crossed the border and my mom made me dress up as a little girl. I saw you. Sure Matt, because people are going to call you that. They're going to call you and ask Julia. That really happened. So what? So yeah. So yeah, he's, I did it and he didn't care. And um, his, his husband was a prize. My brother married to this city planner. Oh really? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:32       That's hilarious. But it's crazy. You know, Joe, like gum, how naive, you know parents can be because my brother came out being a homosexual and my mouth goes why? And my father to why? Why? That's right. You can't figure it out motherfucker. You just have like a little girl. There was two asshole. Do you think that's possible? Maybe. Do you think it's the, here's the thing, he was destined maybe. I don't know. I don't know. It might, it might be, but there is a possibility that uh, you know, people are malleable. You can kind of steer them in different ways. The question is, are those ways good or bad? You know, it's, if he's happy and he's gay and they became gay because he dressed him up as a little girl. If you really truly care about gay people, does that bother you? It's a weird question, right?

Speaker 1:          00:33:29       It's like, wow, man, I don't know. I could you firmly believe in equality of, of, of sexual orientation if you firmly believe in total equality, he should have no issue with someone turning a little boy gay mean really? You should, but then there's the thing like, no, no, no, no. I want people to decide their own destiny, but no one decides their own destiny religiously. Right? Little kids get introduced into religion, but sexually it's work at super important for us. Yes. We don't let the boy be a ball boy. I don't know. Fuck boy, son. Hey. Hey. Give me some boxing gloves. Get out of there. Put the helmet on stops. Third, that Bo Jackson poster and a motorcycle and fucking ride around with shirts off. Yeah man. Right. It's like A. People get super scared if someone turned the kid gay. Like what? What happened?

Speaker 1:          00:34:20       What happened? Some people put up barriers though. They allow their kids would just be what they want to be, but here's the thing. I don't know if that's possible, but I definitely think with no intervention, there's a lot of people that are just gay. They're just gay, was crazy in that. Isn't there like A. There's like a spectrum of gay though, right? Oh, those levels, bro. There's levels like there's the. Well I know because of my brother a negative. He never. My brother, like there's my brother's friends are really, really cool and they're really funny. But they're were flamboyant and my brother not, at least not around us. You know? Who cares if he is though, right? Yeah. Who Cares? Yeah, they not. That's a funny thing man. Like flamboyant gay, that the, that, the, that the, the gay. I knew growing up the flamboyant one, but we uh, we celebrate that.

Speaker 1:          00:35:17       Right? Like look at him. Woo. You see a dude with like a halter top on. You know what I mean? Like days in cut off shorts, like a rainbow striped socks on your like kick damn go. You go boy. Flamboyant Gay. Like we'd love flamboyant gay. But like a, a girl dressed like that. It's like, Oh, you unfortunate you unfortunate child. Like look at you with your 17 inch pumps on with your shorts up to crack your ass with your tiny top on. That is so sad that you need that much attention. Isn't that weird? Weird man. It's weird, man. When it's a boy and he's gay, we fucking celebrate the shit out of it. Looking at me. He's got all these crazy multicolored beads on and he's just fucking blaring gay. That data. Hell yeah. We think that the rave, but a girl that's just screaming out for Dick.

Speaker 1:          00:36:12       Oh, you poor child. You stop that. Stop it. You stop it. What do you. What do you want sex. She's like her mom. You're not going to get love that way. You're not going to get love. You just going to get a bunch of guys want to fuck you. There's a lot of pressure on loose women are the girls because a member like growing up. Oh, she's a good girl, bad girl, bad girl. And we're the good girls. If you were a good girl, I wouldn't be mad at you all the time. Melissa. Melissa. Melissa, can you be a cousin? Jennifer? She's a good girl. I can't believe you did coke. I can't believe my daughter.

Speaker 1:          00:36:50       Do people love coke? They do. You know Dundas Stove, right? No, never just pot. Right? I drink, I don't drink a lot, but I drank. I see him drink bud light once. What? Or the fuck? Oh, will last. My biggest, the one of my best memories, man. Comedian that you're drinking a bud light. It was like, it was like, it was like 1999 thanksgiving. It was like the, you know, like things given already passed in Friday. It was like a, you know, the, the, the Friday after Thanksgiving, the Wednesday before thanksgiving. It's totally like the best days for me or anybody. And for comedy too, especially with the comedy show on Wednesday. And then the next day, the stories, the chicks everywhere. Music, the good times man drugs. But this one particular time, my brother Fernando or whatever, um, I call them up, hey, I'm going to, we're going to go watch.

Speaker 1:          00:37:51       I have a show at the or, and me and other comedians showed up and then we're going to go see you. That's when you had your, your, your fucking hot ass webpage to oregon.net. And you said you were going to perform. So we went to go see you at the main room right after our sets. You fucking crushed it. He's a fucking beard bit. It was hilarious. Crushed it. But then after what you saying, I heard you tell somebody that we're going to go to the house of blues because it was his birthday. Yeah. So I said, fuck it. Let's go to. So we are winning and we were across the street man. It was like so many comedians have that time at the House of Blues and Rick James showed up. Started playing the piano. That was the shit man. Yeah man. That was a chewy. Did quite a few shows over there. How many shows did he do over there? He did one every once a month on a Tuesday too. He was good and it was like, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. This is chewy. The dude who's the door guy at the comedy store is a bad ass musician.

Speaker 1:          00:39:05       That song hate chewy. What's going on? That's actually, that's a great fucking song. That's a great song. And I was sitting there going, how crazy is this? So we didn't know. Our friend Chewy has this special gift. He was good. I would put big overalls. He was good. It was cool to watch too. Like it was a cool show. Like we had a good fucking time. He was a good musician, Huh? Dude. He's a real good musician and he's our friend. It was so. It was crazy. It was both. It was like you're seeing your friend on stage and then you seen your friend kill. You're like, damn, he's good. This is good. It was awesome. I remember one time mom dumped me. He was doing his, his jokes that the orn he said holly was fucked up. Like that guy right there, chewy. He. He's a rock star. Rock star once a month. Kills it. Right now. He's telling me where the fucking park.

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       I think you'd like working there to be honest with mailed the letter for me one night when we're putting the letters up. I always enjoy that guy. He was always very cool to me to, you know, said people are scared of chewing. Juliana. I always got along great. You know, he just looked like the wrong dude to fuck with him, like hillbilly but Mexican, but he's a gentleman, always a gentlemen, if you're a good guy to chew it, he's a great guy to you. But he's a talented musician. Man. It was crazy to watch. It's crazy to watch your friend just killing it at the house of Blues after just say what's up, what's up chewy? You know that song. But that song, Hey Joe, what's going on? That's like, he made a really good song. Shoulders. Right? Did he kind of. I'm trying to remember.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       I'm definitely lifted it up. It was fucking great man. He was great. Like he was like, he's a, he was a guy that I would actually go see. I was like, this is amazing. That's one thing I liked about being a comedian that when I was younger was hoping to do after where the was crazy. You know, like, even when like for sometimes you know, you go to like dark areas, you know, if you want to party hard. Like I had a kid one time, I was doing a short Montebello. Remember Willie Barcelona? Yeah, really works, said it, had that crazy ass fucking wildly for 11 years and somebody came in and said, I'm thinking this comedian yours. He said, hey man, there's this guy, they're looking for Comedians to perform at three in the morning, got a harder bucks. And I said, fuck it, I ain't doing shit.

Speaker 1:          00:41:41       I ain't doing shit. I ain't got alive. So he gave him the address and we get there. It's like an undercover police officer, security guard as his house in Burbank and um, we perform at three in the morning for them, but all the shit in their house. Yeah man. And what Joe, the house was built for like partying, like 80 style were like, we don't, you don't even know what time it is. Like the coaches were there, courteous all over the house. You couldn't see the sun come in. No more so lit perfectly like the house look like at 5:00 PM all day. Wow. And all over the house there was drugs but there were not openly out there for everybody to take only like four people who knew what was going on. He had liquid coke. They're like the, you know the nasal sprays? Yeah, he had like those filled with water and coke because they can do, when you do coke sometimes the coke is stuck in your knees and your nose so you're going to pour a little water to help it go down.

Speaker 1:          00:42:44       Jesus. But this guy had little squeeze Varvatos all over the house, like nasal sprays, Haley's. So I will see people lean over in the back of the house and then grab something. And so then I found out where it was and I just, instead of just putting it back, I just walked it with. I kept it God damn. Because I stood at that House to 1130 in the morning and I got there at two in the morning. But this is funny. The Guy who owned the house, he had nobody cleaning the house. So everybody like it. Like if you grab a little bit from his house, like, like if Joe Rogan picked up those beer through return trashcan, he'll give you points. Like, like Doug, he points his name was doug. Joe Rogan got three points. So if you get like, so this house you got invited to his house, bike by text because Doug knows you, but he knows you, someone else invite to you, but now that you got points, you know enough points, you get a personal call.

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       That's crazy. It was crazy. There was a guy walking around. Hello Lynn, Marilyn Manson. But it wasn't Marilyn Manson just looked like he was just hired for the show. I guess for the Party to. I hate to bring up this thing with your brother again though. I'm bringing it up. But this is. Do you think it is possible really that if someone dresses their kid up, all jokes aside, is that possible that if you dress your kid up as a girl for like a little bit and coach them into acting like a girl, that it turns them gay? I don't honestly. All jokes aside, I don't really think it works like this stop right when they got here. Or did he keep playing that way? No, I don't think he, he, he, uh, he stopped. He was like a male afterwards. But it could have been a total coincidence. I think was probably coincidence.

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       It just happened. Yeah, but no, nobody wants to think that people that susceptible, but they definitely are in some ways, right. Maybe not sexually because that seems to be like a biological thing, but in terms of like behavior, like racism for sure. Right. Racism carries from, from parent to child pretty pretty well, you know, if they have a good relationship with their parents and their parents are racist, that shit will carry in because a lot of people who are racist, they still love their kids so they're really good at their kids, but they're racist. So the kids associate really good, like love with family also with like distrust of certain certain groups and colors and that's a almost a thing that they're taught by the people that care about them, like wild animals. Man. They're taught well, wild animal behavior by their parents and that's the same shit with people.

Speaker 2:          00:45:25       It's a weird thing, man. It's weird. It's a weird thing that human beings are malleable. You know, that the, you can get them to behave a certain way in Iceland, but then a different way in Brazil or a certain way in Japan and a different way in China. Like I was, uh, I was in China recently. One of the things that's crazy is when you're around large groups of people, they just walk in front of you, man. They just walked through you. They walked through little kids, they walked through everybody. And it's not rude, it's just they have a different way of moving around because there's so many people and so many spots in China, they're not being rude. They don't consider it rude. It's just different. They're just trying to get there and they don't mind everybody bumps into each other a little bit.

Speaker 2:          00:46:05       We're like, Oh, you touched me. Oh, I can't believe this. That guy touched me with his hand doesn't buy into their fucking head butting each other, but they're not doing it mean they just kind of going through each other. They don't mind touching each other. So they're just, you know, you see an opening, they're going in that opening. Oh, you don't look it, you don't own the space in front of you, bitch. There's a little spot. I'm going to go in there. Boom. And they don't think it's bad thing. They do it here to Chinese people do. Oh yeah. Asian people know Armenian people. Older people were trying to catch the bus. We were all trying to cut in a bus and they run. They rush in front of me. They don't say, excuse me. That's why I know how to say, excuse me, and Armenian mixing.

Speaker 2:          00:46:45       You know when people don't mind being jammed up like that in the winter in Boston when they get on the team, you know those trains, like if you leave in fenway park and it's like fucking zero degrees outside in the winter and you get on the tea together and especially if it's sunny out so nobody feels creepy about it and they shut those doors and everybody is just jammed in there huddled together. Who? Penguins. Yeah, you don't mind. You don't mind your fucking freezing. So everybody has more of a sense of. That's like a big problem with La. It's too easy to just live here. It's too easy to like physically survive. It's too hot. The hot, the heat's one thing, but you could get by. You get used to that. You can't get used to the cold, but you can't do it. You can't stay out there.

Speaker 2:          00:47:32       You could stay. It's the heat's way easier. You could stay out there if you have a shade and you have some water and live. You literally can't live in Boston outside. No, you can't. You can't go to sleep there. If you go to sleep there, you'll die. You won't make it. It's zero degrees out. You're not going to make it. Oh, it's. You can't just sleep on the ground when it's 30 below zero, like in Alaska or some shit here in panhandle and that code. No, and so you're going to be a hardy motherfucker to survive those places. It's too easy to survive la. We don't have enough interaction with nature. We've got a distorted sense of where we're sitting in this whole thing in nature. Go to Griffith Park. Yeah. We don't even have bugs, man. When I was in Thailand, they got crazy bugs.

Speaker 2:          00:48:17       Do bugs. Bite the fuck out of here. We got this little weird bites all over. You and mosquitoes are ferocious. Those are real bugs, man. We got here. Roaches. We got nothing. We got a few roaches. We barely have any flies. We ain't got shit. No bugs want a part of this crazy dry air. That's the. We're super lucky, man. Bugs don't like dry air bugs like the crawley ones don't seem to mind, but the fly, once they fucking hate dryer, lots of hummingbirds eaten them up to do. We do. There's not lots of hummingbirds anywhere else I've lived like there is here. We rehabbed a honeybee, a hummingbird in my house and released it. We found a girls found a hummingbird that was wounded and the, uh, nursed it back to health and then rereleased it in the wild. We have a little hummingbird feeders in the backyard.

Speaker 2:          00:49:07       Dude. Hummingbirds, the coolest little animals ever. They're so weird. I'll put up a video of, of this hummingbird. It's so cute. Like they fed it sugar water life super fast, right? Dude, do they fly so fast that you can't, like if you see it with a stop motion or slow motion photography, slow motion videos, you can't believe how fast it is. Like you're, you're, you're watching. You're like, Whoa, look at. That's insane. Like what kind of animal evolved like that little tiny wings and they're going like a fucking billion miles an hour. Like look at, look at that thing in slow Mo. See if he could find one. Like there'S no animal like that. But imagine if an eagle did that.

Speaker 2:          00:49:49       I'm asking you how fucked everything would be if an eagle could move like a hummingbird or just a giant fucking giant flying thing with knives for fingers and it's just snatch and fish out of water and it's as big as a Turkey and it moves like a hummingbird. What the fuck? Like if you think about that's what a tiger is, right? A tiger is a big thing that moves sanely fast. Look, a little of those wings are too narrow and never within their wings to it. Now, do those wines are so small that if they were in a superhero, if I saw a superhero and the body was that big, the wings without small

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       tap pitch couldn't fly. Kid outta here. That wouldn't even work, bro. Dynamically glucose, small. The wings are. Look how big the body is. It's fucking stupid. I click on a little. Those wings are men. if you went to like one of those hot wings places and they gave you a wing like that, you'd be so angry. Oh hell no. Release for this is the tiniest little wings. Such a small little animal. But they're so adorable. They have no legs are uh, they have likes. Yeah. It was just tucked in there. Tucked into the backseat. Tiny. Yeah. They're so Beautiful. Such an unusual little bird to who eats them. Oh, I'm sure everything that can snack dishes, but I think good luck catching them. Good luck catching that little fucker.

Speaker 5:          00:51:16       I told you I was listening at leonardo book the other day and uh, one of the weird things in the beginning it mentions is that he had a very weird fascination or it was written in one of his notebooks that he wanted to, I think it was he wanted to describe the tongue of a woodpecker would. This is like an obviously the 14 hundreds where you'd have to catch the woodpecker, kill it, dissect it, and then did the description of yourself and I guess he does have descriptions of it, which at that time are so descriptive. You would have to be a scIentist. Like he was. I wonder, really crazy. Wow. You would catch a woodpecker. How do you catch one of those fuckers? Know why you would, how you thought of that was making them.

Speaker 3:          00:51:53       Do you think he just shot it out of the sky? Came up with the trapper of some kind. I bet, I guess. Right? Yeah. Imagine those dudes that were just like initially studying species's, like imagine just like writing down drawing pictures of a cat that you just found in the fucking jungle. Like being one of those guys that started the first people to document what animals exist out there because like how long have we known? How long have you had a good sense of what animals exist out there? How many years has it been? You think that people. A good sense of all the animals in the world. Like right now we know about giant bears that live in Russia, right? We know about komodo dragons, we know about nile crocodiles. We know about science, we know about. We know about all these animals that exist because we've got all the videos and the information, but how long has that been a thing?

Speaker 3:          00:52:47       How long have people known what was in all these different spots? Has it been 2000 years? Has it been three? How many? How many thousand years has it been like reliable information? No crackings, no fucking sea dragons, you know, stop you making shit up. like what did you really sick? Like how long has it been where they have a detailed account of what animals exist. I was one of the things he used. I don't know the as they've been apparent or the hollow, there've been a pen or something to ride on hold the first and they have a road. Wasn't writing I think was like the middle east. I think it was all like sumir and those places think that's where they think

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       it came from. Do you ever see that writing man, dude, it's crazy. look, and it's called cuneiform. It's like it looks like nails. It looks like they're like old school lead carpenter nails and they're going left and right and up and down the alphabet to. Yeah, look at it. Oh wow. That's, I think I'm, you know, obviously I'm not an expert, but I think they believed this is the oldest written language. See if that's true. Is cuneiform the oldest written language? They think that was where it started. That it started with these little, uh, like they look like nails. Look at that shit dude. It's such a fantastic looking language because it almost looks like some crazy computer coders. it's funny how all this kind of language, someone in who's board in prison will pick it up and learn how to write. Let this with another inmate and give each other messages for the guards.

Speaker 2:          00:54:21       Wouldn't know. Look what it says this. This is, this is the one, it's called a mil to mil. I'm the oldest language comes from Sri Lanka, Singapore and to indian states to mill is still spoken by approximately 70 million people across the world to is one of the oldest literary canons of any knowledge and the world with the earliest piece of tamil writing sand graham literature dating to approximately 300 bce. So that's 300 years before current era. That's not, that's not super old. Uh, see the thing language, I think sumerian is susie. It says sumerian first developed 3,200 bc. Okay. So I think they're saying what's the oldest language and is active in the world and that's two mill and that comes from 300 bc. But the sumerian language, yeah. Is the oldest shit ever. So that's what we saw. That's cuneiform. So it was created using a read stylist to make wedge shaped indentations and clay tablets.

Speaker 2:          00:55:21       So they think as far as they know, that's the oldest shit. So that, that's, that's only 5,000, 300 something years to develop the, to record transactions, to keep track of money or to talk, you think. Which was more important to them at the time transaction would be the two probably everything. Writing things down. Try to figure out what, what animal did not eat, you know, try to figure out what makes people sick. Keep track of who paid taxes. We did it. So 3,200 bc, what is that? That's 5,218 years ago. Wow. That seems so recent that I love that man. Five thousand years ago they figured out how to write shit down. Like what are you saying? What did they do before then? Wow, fuck. And we're in. Nobody had raised the more I barely hand, right. I suck at teaching them what I think when I write, I write. My handwriting deteriorates rapidly with every

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       stroke. I barely do it anymore. You still do this? No, I don't. Logos. What does that logo as you do that you should do that as in high school when I was bored at the superman logo. Yeah. I used to do all the band names, like band logos. I used to do the v and the, you know, the, what did a day when we're talking about George Washington. I saw a fact and I was trying to bring it up in time, but I had to go back and find it and I just remembered it because. Well, what you're talking about, do you know when the first dinosaur bones were discovered? Dude, we talked about this once a. I don't remember what it was more recent than something like that. I don't know if he was already president, done with all of that. All. Everything that they had written and talked about.

Speaker 3:          00:57:10       Everything we'd go back and discuss was all before they even knew like dinosaurs even existed almost. Yeah. Yeah. Clearly crazy. Yeah. It is really crazy. It's hard to believe that. We mean imagine you have like, okay, we think we got an understanding of what is here and what's been here. It's probably been similar to what he, what the fuck is this? And they find a bone that's as big as a bus. It was like, wait a minute, what the fuck is this? That's what it would have freaked me out, dude. you imagined you find a bone as big as a bus and you're like, holy shit, this is one animal. What is this? This is a leg. what? He keeps getting bigger and bigger pieces and then you realize you have a brontosaurus. Just imagine finding all that shit, not knowing it exists and going, what the fuck is this thing that looks like a rib and what is this thing and that noise, how big the world is.

Speaker 3:          00:58:05       So you'd think of. There's another one around the world that they live. Yeah. Oh yeah man, for a lot. You know, they sent david spade or david spade christ. They spent david choe. They sent david cho to the Congo and advice. This is how I found out about dave. They they sent it and then I found out about him again from bordain was telling me how amazing is they? They sent david's show. David cho was already rich at the time. This whole crazy david cho is. He was wealthy as fuck. Like he didn't have to do anything, he'd already made a gang of money, like gambling and shit, and he decides to go down to the Congo to go looking for a fucking dinosaur man. It's the craziest episode of vice because these people, some people that lived there, or at least they're saying they're convinced that there's.

Speaker 3:          00:58:50       I mean, they could be just fucking with white people. That could be a thing too, right? Which could, could be fucking with westerners. Some korean kid comes by and they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll show her the fucking thing. I was going to add about the davinci thing. He used to fuck with his friends with the lizard dressed up like a little baby dragon. And he'd freak them out and like, look what I look what I found. Look what I got. Davinci did that. You'd have to believe him because he's fucking davinci, right? That's hilarious. Add things to creatures. Pretend he's made a new space, a new, found a new species. Look at dave. He was young as fuck to men is a long ass time ago. And uh, he went to the jungle wet looking for these supposedly bronto sources that people see in the jungle. Can you imagine? They found one. I mean, there's not enough jungle to hide like someone else credible. Someone will get a picture. Everyone has a phone now. Even people that live in the jungle. Right. What would it hide? It would hide in the jungle.

Speaker 3:          00:59:52       He would have a dam or a cave in the water. You would have to be an enormous area where people never go for a big thing to be alive today that people don't know about. Like, they'll find like a new dear, you know, they'll find a new dear sometimes like, oh, look aT this. We've got a new frog. Yeah, we found a new dear. This is incredible. It's in the jungles of Cambodia. It's a new. It's a subspecies of this deer. Rare footage shows the last surviving member of an uncontacted uncontacted amazon tribe. Yeah. I saw this support, dude. He's the last of the mohicans. That's meanwhile. That's a camera man. That's a camera man. They fucking gave him 50 bucks. Just go out there and beats of trees. I'm going to get some footage. It looks like blair witch project and have you just whack it against a tree.

Speaker 3:          01:00:36       I'm going to say you the last surviving. We're bro. We're going to get paid for this. Come on bro. You look like an old fucking guy that lives in the jungle. Just do it. 50 bucks. Do. I'll give you 50 bucks. What else are you going to do today? Since they've been tracking them since the nineties. That's crazy. We live in by himself since the nineties. We got a weird problem with that, right? Like wow, poor guy. What if he dies out there like that when he's going to die here in a different way? What are you talking about? Whom he status living alone. If he's sad, he's sad. If he, you knoW, he saw those people with cameras. He probably chase out and with a blow dart, you know, if he embraced it, just thought what a way to go. Got himself a nice pair of nike's, you know, gucci fanny pack or what? I come out of the woods, bro.

Speaker 3:          01:01:27       He shot at someone at 2005 or you're wounded someone into with it. Oh fuck. Yeah. You don't want that, man. That guy is going to shoot arrows at you. Imagine that he's a criminaL. They haven't even gone and gotten them shooting arrows at people. You son of a bitch. Let's do. They didn't want. He didn't want them to get saved, but it's funny, man. We look at people that live in a way that's different than the way we live. Like, oh, we got to save them. We got to save him. We got to bring them over to the good side. I know we got to save him, but someone living in their car, he's paya. Yeah, yeah, yeah, man. Someone living in their car, fine. Until the guy. That guy that's camping under the freeway. Normal, normal, super normal. There was a guy living across the street from my house.

Speaker 3:          01:02:12       I live in echo park. He will live in instead of a bogle. Whoa. Here's the thing, right? They don't. They let american tribes controlled giant chunks of land. they give them reservations in the 18, whatever it was was like 18, 65 or some shit where they did all this. The wars land never took, nothing grows and they didn't want. They didn't get many of the good spots, so they give. They give them all like think. when did that happen? Let's find out first. That was my question was would you ever allow them to live the much of tears, right? What is it? 18, 87, 87. Wow, that's crazy. But would they allow them to live like they lived before? The europeans intervened, like if you really just left them alone and they live like fucking horseback trading, you know, animals for bullets is really low like they lived back then.

Speaker 3:          01:03:12       Indian land for sale find lands in the west. This is a crazy. Add grazing. Have your own easy payments. Perfect. Title, possession within 30 days. Indian land for sale. Is this real? Yes. This is A real ad that they had back then. Brassica studies from Nebraska as website, okay, this is, this is the next art for the studio. We need that. We need that. That needs to. That enforced. They'll make a reservation. Yeah. We need that framed on the wall. How much there is a bigger the land. That's what we need. We need that framed to that. Ain't that long ago, man. That is not that long ago. That is a crazy thing. It's like, look, we captured this shit from these people that will sell it to you. Who wants to buy it? There's a picture of the dude we jacked. They got a picture of the dude they checked.

Speaker 3:          01:04:11       There's a previous owner. This is the previous owner. Look at that. $20 an acre in Wyoming. Do you think that they had an acre? How much of that? No. $20 an acre. Wow. Do that right now. I mean it depends on where it is. If it's in beverly hills, that's why we $14 million or $15 an acre. 15 bucks and acre in Oregon and here's the. But look at the dude that got the dude. They got like the most regal looking native american looks like a chief. Let's look at his image. Perfect fuck. Like a perfect representation of like a, an elder. Like, uh, a wise, powerful old indian like a chief, right? He looks like the dude they be running shit. like we got it from this dude. We got the prime cuts baby. Huh? We got the fucking tomahawk ribeye with the bone. Come on bro. For you indian land the best. Nothing but the best. We got it off that guy. Look at him. We said the highest guy on the totem pole. Could you imagine if there's parts of this country where decided

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       to live like the native americans live straight up, full stop. They wore animal skins. They, they, they tanned from shooting them with bows and arrows. They made their own bows and arrows. They did everything the way that the people did before the europeans arrived. They say, fuck your technology. Fuck your laws. Fuck your bullshit. Just give us a fertile, gigantic swath of land that we could live like we live before. And then people just gravitate to that. Do you know how crazy that would be? People would fuck it up though. They would do a reality show of it. They would have certain. Some of the horses were, have like fucking cameras and you see the fucking westworld and dick's flopping out a loin cloth and people would have to kill people the way they killed people back then too. They'd have to have tools aNd cit.

Speaker 2:          01:06:05       Scalpel, I think. I don't know who. Who invented scalping. Do you think scalping was invented by the native americans or was it invented by the white people? By the white people? They, uh, we covered this. I used to collect them. Yeah. These bag. What was it? Their idea first? I'm wondering whose idea it was first because sometimes some of the shit that people do in war, you know, they'll, they'll copy shit from the enemy to like enemies doing it. They'll day, uh, we'll fucking do it was a bit of birth. Oh, he, he did the worst shit of all time. Brutal. Give her a listen to that dan carlin hardcore history series to after the show I'm going to send to you gotta. listen to it. It's nuts if you've got the time because it's like five parts and you get sucked in, but it just shows you how insane that guy and his family were and what the empire that he created.

Speaker 2:          01:06:57       This one guy, his real name is too much and they had all kinds of shit. They had catapults, light human bodies on fire. They would. They will do a quick as shooting airwatch horseback. Right? That's what saved them. Well, that was one of their strategies, but they were extremely stout people. They were very, very strong people. Apparently. All I know about that. I'll just full disclosure. All I know about is what I learned from dan carlin's hardcore history podcast and like a couple of articles. I've never really read that much about the mongols, but what he said was that they had these bows that required 160 pounds to pull back, which is just insane. So they must be shooting heavier arrows that could kill people better than anything. The smaller people or the weaker people would would possess and they were a nomadic horse people, so they were traveling around, living in tents like they despise people that live in cities.

Speaker 2:          01:07:53       They were just the strongest, most ruthless army the world has ever seen at the time like nobody had ever seen anything like this. They would just. They killed millions of people. They thInk New York times had an article that said they killed so many people. They change the carbon footprint of the earth. There was less people, a noticeable number. If you go and you look through the ice core samples and they are starting to attributed, or some people at least are attributing that to gingiss con killing some somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 percent of the population on earth. The one out of 10, he killed more people than aids. Yeah, definitely. Right? How many people didn't get killed? If you had to guess, someone was just talking about that recently and say, no one should die from hiv anymore. No one should die of aids.

Speaker 2:          01:08:37       It literally shouldn't have to happen anymore, and that crazy. This take medication. Now. We were kids, everybody was terrified to aids. Aids was a death sentence while eating twinkies, terrified of aids while eating the thing that's slowly killing you. Terrified to get into aids. A little kid gets it. Everybody will want to go to school no more. Remember that one kid go to school? Yeah, the magic god in there, but they will. All right. Magic. Got it. I remember being in my car. I was in my car. I was living in revere Massachusetts. Rear. Yeah. This, uh, apartment complex and I was driving my car and I was on the high. I was on the road listening to the radio. Like, you know, you see where the traffic lights are. You see, you see, you remember it's like burned in your brain. like, ah, magic johnson has aids.

Speaker 2:          01:09:29       What in my car? What's, what's out? I remember thinking like it was a scene in a vampire movie monster movie or something like a zombie outbreak. Like, oh my god, now it's reached one of the greatest basketball players of all time. this is insane. Are people going to just start dropping off like flies? Now we're going to start, please just, I wouldn't condoms right away afterwards. I don't think so. We need, you know, animals bro. Savage, savage. I mean there's a reason why there's 7 billion of us. We stop. People need to stop pretending that when they're fully, fully aroused that they're thinking straight like you, you are operating at about 10 percent of your normal resources like aids, whatever. Who's got a. He's still got a little bit with the code. Will the, you know, it's crazy that it was just primarily gay people in drug users that we're getting it. That's what a weird disease man. That's a. That's a weird one man. That's a strange thing when your body starts weakening and shutting down like whoa. But when you really think about the actual danger and death, like I think even while aids was in its height of killing people, I don't think it was killing people as much as the flu was right.

Speaker 5:          01:10:54       The numbers I'm finding now or depending on worldwide or us. So worldwide, tuberculosis is now killing more people than aids. But this says that only one point, 1 million people today in the us are living with aids and I think I saw,

Speaker 2:          01:11:09       but living with aids, it's like you're at the border of getting aids. Is that what it is? It's liKe, yeah, you have h supposedly this again, I'm not a dOctor. Right. Supposedly it's like you have hiv, your immune system gets weakened. You catch aids, which is acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which means your t cell levels have reached a certain count where they identify it as aids, right? Yeah. IT actually did type in a tennis is going to hiv. So that's. They're definitely connected. So it's not people that also their immune system fails. That's outside of hiv. This. So I clicked on this. I'll share what I clicked on. So I typed in that end, and this is showing this. It says at one point 2 million people, I received an aids diagnosis since the early eighties. Since the early eighties. Okay. So 1 million people. And there have been 12,000 in 2014. There were 12,000, 333 deaths due to any cause of people with diagnosed hiv infection ever classified as aids and what does that mean then at $6? A weird way of saying it with people. I'll say it again. It says there were 12,000, 333 deaths due to any cause of people with diagnosed hiv infection. Ever classified as aids. Isn't that a strange way of saying that? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:12:35       With the. I don't know what that immedion could lose the declassification if your immune system gets strong enough. I don't know. It says with diagnosed hiv infection ever classified as aids.

Speaker 2:          01:12:46       Okay. Are the. I don't know, mayBe I'm too stupid for that because what I also saw was that a million people died last year from it, but that'd be worldwide and this then contradicts because it says a million people have only been diagnosed and this is only in the us and that other numbers worldwide. So it gets really sketchy anD it says 6,721 deaths were attributed directly to hiv. Yeah. So it seems that they, they definitely think it's still killing people. Definitely still is tuberculosis. But what is, how many people die from the flu every year?

Speaker 2:          01:13:19       What? What do you would you think would be the most? The most ruthless, normal killer would be the flu. The flu would kill the most people. Thirty 6,000. Way more way more people Got jacked by the flu every year. Every year. And what was the number from the aids number was total, right. How many of those people that flu shots though? What is it? Two thousand 14. So it's a third or so. So what's the third aids to the flu? Aids is about one slash third of the deaths of the flu per year on average. I don't know if I'm that interesting. It's like we're not scared of the thing that kills us way more. We're really scared of the thing that kills less people because it kills them through butts. That's what it is. It has to be. We're terrified that it kills people through

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       because like the flu, it seems like we should really be concentrating on that thing. That thing's killing way more people. People not washing their hands, but they're like, look, we can't stop that, but we can stop all of his buttocks. Weird. Right. It's weird like when we have. Maybe it's just because it's a new thing that was kiLling people because it didn't exist and then it did exist. That's probably what it is, right? Like, yeah, because it came out of nowhere because it was in like, what was it during the eighties? Yeah. Murphy said, and you're walking around with the a's on your lip. Oh, was that, was that delirious? Do you remember sam kennison his bid on it. He goes, they say sam shouldn't make fun of aids aid. Sam Is a communicable disease. Straight people can get it to. He goes, no, it's not our dad's.

Speaker 3:          01:15:03       He had this crazy dangerous bit about it and like way back then like, whoa. It's like a cro in around like 1980. I don't know if that's accurate, but. So 1980 was the highest peak. Maybe it's in thousands. So yeah, it seems like low. So it seems like it seems like late seventies, right? Is that somewhere around 1980? The one thing too, I read that there's around 300,000 total deaths and a third of them are in New York, 300,000 total deaths, a third in New York and the flute and this is all told ever. Again, just the stats are all multiple pages. So here's how many of the. See I get so confused about all this shit because uh, some people believe that a lot of these people also were shooting heroin. A lot of these people were also doing a lot of drugs. I would wonder, you know, if they're really partying hard and they also get aids, I would, I would always wonder like how much of you partying hard is destroying your immune system too.

Speaker 3:          01:16:02       LIke if you're, if you have a disease, like say you have cancer and you're struggling with cancer and you just decided to hardcore start smoking meth and then you die from the cancer. Like is it, isn't, didn't something else kill you too. Right? Not saying that the cancer's good for you, cancer, certainly bad for you, but if you have cancer and just decided to go on a meth binge and destroy your immune system, it's got to contribute to your health, but we don't consider that. We will consider up. They'll fucking cancer. Got him. Cancer. Got him. It did get him. He definitely did get them, but he was also smoke and math all day. Feeling good. Doing robberies or robberies with fucking skulls. Painted out. It's 7:11. He was amped. Dude was amped with cancer. That's. That's also. I mean if he dies of a heart attack, like all the cancer gave him a heart attack. Yeah, probably. That probably had something to do with it. DefInitely was not good. It's definitely not good to have cancer, but it's also not good to be smoking meth while you have cancer smoking bad. So how many of these people that got aids were like extremely healthy folks

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       that like jogged on a regular basis and ate a lot of fruit and vegetables are hard to get that data. I know I would like to get that data. This is not like a prejudice perspective. I'm just as a curious person, I would like to get all that I would like to know. What is it that actually does it? Is it, um, is it the method kills you? Is it a disease that kills you? Is it a combination of all these things? We always want to attribute death to one thing, but I would imagine that with all the people that have died of the flu, there's a number of deaths. When you look at the fluid, you're like, man, that the flu could just catch you. The flu could just catch you and you catch you when you're already week two, maybe your, your rundown, you've been working too much and then the flu hits you.

Speaker 2:          01:17:54       When your immune system's devastated and it gets deep into you and gets you. Everybody's vulnerable. I mean, the thing about diseases that's so strange to me, so some of them are associated with certain certain groups of people like aids, aids is one of those ones is just so associated with gay people that it's like a really politically charged disease and we concentrate on it like really heavily. But I think it, I really think it wasn't just the gay thing was also that it was, it was new, new, there was a new thing that was killing people. We were always worried about that. Right. There's always these pandemic movies where some new crazy disease breaks loose, just runs rampant. We don't have an immune system for it. People will start dying and they need to get the medication to the people and get it to the baby quickly.

Speaker 2:          01:18:37       People are putting it on subway subways. Just always sOme shit like tHat. We always have some new shit that's gonna get us swine flu, flu. So that was. So aids had a dual, a disadvaNtage one that is connected to gay people and people are like, oh, what do they do over there? What are they going to get it? I'm lucky. Yeah, exactly. TheRe was that and then there was also blood transfusions, car accident. That's right, right. People were worried about getting from blood transfusions, so that means back then they were never. They were like just letting random people donate blood without checking it. I don't think they had a test for it for awhile. I think for awhile they didn't have a task for it. Then they have to find like I guess they have to find like antibodies in your blood or some shit and like.

Speaker 2:          01:19:22       But it's so weird that wall. This is all going on. How many people were dying from cancer every year just from smoking cigarettes. It'S fucking crazy numbers. Crazy numbers. People dropping like flies and no one thinks about that. When you see a guy smoking a cigarette, you don't think that guys killing themselves. They're like, oh, he's outside and for the restaurant having a cig, normal shit. Now that guy's. That guy's poisoning themselves. Guy who delivers, but it's just strange to me like we get really specific about what fears we have in terms of what way we die and when a new disease comes along that becomes one of the most specific ones, but while you're indulging in all these behaviors that will also kill you in way larger numbers than diseases too. Fucking weird man. Very weird. Human Beings, me were so

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       strange. So strange in the way we prioritize things. Always. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:20:14       Do you get the flu shot? No. Joey diaz though. I won't give up. The joke is, but I think had he has been born of the best new bits about it. I never got a flu shot, but I've gotten the flu once and it was like two years ago out of nowhere, man just came up. I hit a fat ass bowl to my legs, got hot and my whole body felt hot and I told my wife, I think I'm going to get sick. So you've hiT a bowl and that's when it came on my own. I want to stay with a bow, but that's when I started feeling hot.

Speaker 3:          01:20:42       Huh. So the, we'd made you uh, aware of it? Yes. But it wasn't the weekend though. Hey asshole. Yeah. The. We were struggling like, hey asshole, you got the flu. You better pay attention to your body. I got a couple of years ago, I kicked it quick because of heart. I caught it coming on. I felt it. I was like, oh, I know what this is. And I just laid down. They didn't do shit. I just laid down and drank a lot of tea. Chill the fuck out. I didn't do shit. I just lay down and relax and let my body recuperate itself. I got lucky that it was, it happened during a time where I wasn't. I didn't have anything to do that day so I can take time off.

Speaker 1:          01:21:21       I heard that when you get a real hot or real a good flu, it let your body fighting off something inside your body.

Speaker 3:          01:21:28       Yeah. Your body's basically going to war. Fuck yeah. You sweating up a storm. The body's trying to chase out the invaders. You got people trying to get over that wall in my body. Your body has little organisms trying to get over their walls. You got wall set up to keep these things from breeding and you know, taking over parts of your body. She got this immune system just going to war. You got a little war going on in your body when you're sick. I know that everything is fighting to got pcp. I we'd fight and got cracked fighting. Yeah. I mean people don't like when you judge people's health and you know, you definitely shouldn't judge someone based on whether or not they're sick or when what you're looking at when you see people that are sick, including yourself. All of us where we're looking at as an organism that is at war and we have this weird instinct to kind of get awaY from them. Like, oh my god, I could get that. I could get that organism, whatever that. Well, I got to get away from it. What if one of the troops, troops jumps off of him and hops into me? I can't afford to take time off work now. Get away from me.

Speaker 1:          01:22:34       I don't have. I don't have time for.

Speaker 3:          01:22:36       I don't got time for your coughing, blood, don't pump blood on a zombie man.

Speaker 1:          01:22:40       But look how many people like um, who don't have, who don't ever really take care of their body because I know like before I want to coming stanley, I never had healthcare how just gambling with my body, how do we go to other than go to the hospital and I was really dying and when I went to the hospital I went to this cheap little hospital right here in echo park. Bad was iT, it was fucked up man. it was like, it was real. It was, it smelled like an old elementary school and they're sick all down and it smelled like pine sol because the old korean doctor there and I told her what was wrong with me and she, I told her I have a flu. I got my butt hurts because I might have a hemorrhoid. I don't know what's going on. I'm bleeding out of my ass.

Speaker 1:          01:23:28       Damn. And she goes, okay, sit down. And now she's all, she and I paid $100 and which would give you, she gave me medicines for, for The fourth of hemorrhoid because I had been running for the first time and then she gave me antibiotics for my flu. What is hemorrhoids come from? Does it come from. You're trying to force your pool out, man. That's what someone told me my first time. I didn'T know man. I was out. I was on the road and opened the low carb diet, the atkins diet. So I was fucking with. I eat cheese and meat all week. you're bound up and I didn't eat, drink no water. I drink soda so I must've been stuffed. So joe, I'm in my, I'm in the bathroom, like the show's over and like two days, nothing right now. And they could feel like, um, like my, my butthole already felt like, um, have broken glass inside. Oh, that feeling. So I finally, I pushed too hard because I, I pushed her like I was having a baby. I waS like, I was doing mas and then up on the youtube screen please. So I fuck it up while he's talking and then I pushed and I pushed and then like, aw man, I could just feel I saw like I wiped myself and it might the toilet paper like a fucking tampon. And I was in pain. Dude.

Speaker 3:          01:24:54       It says the veins around your anus tend to stretch under pressure and may bulge or swell swollen veins. Hemorrhoids can develop from increased pressure in the lower rectum due to straining during bowel movements, sitting for long periods of time on the toilet. Eddie bravo has a hilarious bit about it

Speaker 1:          01:25:14       being on his phone, on his phone and taking a shit. It's very funny. Remember, didn't he talk about it on here? I think you've talked about it on here, but it was crazy. Yeah. NOt good for your butthole to be sitting in that. How would describe the position of the pain? It feels like? Um, I remember talking about in a bit, I said that it felt like every night though, the goals sort of siloed by using me. Like, fuck you in the ass at night. How many days did you go before he took a shut off? Three days, that's what the share, that's one of the pain started and I blew my butthole out I guess and then like three days later I didn't shit right without paying for like two weeks I was afraid of fucking neat man

Speaker 3:          01:25:56       about to go to a doctor and they had to literally break up the shit in his butt hole. They had to go up as bought with an instrument and break it up

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       and flush him out. Give him something. I think he had to take something, some sort of diuretic and some stool loosening agent like some hardcore drugs and then they had to go in there with like a chisel and chop off this concrete log that he at the bottom of his button and then he, you know, he hadn't shit in many days. Try to. Yeah, it was dangerous and he couldn't get it out so he was literally plugged up and it kept piling in. It's not like it's going to stop eating, it's just going to keep piling in. So he's got a blockade of like shit rocks at the end of his booty tunnel and it's real property can be bad. So real problem. He had to go to a doctor. My life finally came out and then a clink clink, but It was all bad with all dry, with ugly, painful.

Speaker 2:          01:26:48       You gotta eat your vegetables, speed my speed. And after I finished paying, it was hurting my butthole after I peed. I mean that's one thing that I freak out about people that are on this carnivore diet. I hear this carnivore diet stuff and they're like, oh no, no problem at all. No problem at all. You don't eat any vegetables. You got no problem at all. Wouldn't really kill you. Eat some broccoli with that little kale is elusive in that motherfucking line up. I just can't imagine the broccoli's killing you. I think if broccoli's killing you, come on, there's probably something else wrong you should probably like get your blood work done for. I fiGured out what the vitamins are. If you eat broccoli and you start getting headaches, bra, eat broccoli. Folks, what about gains? Are you broccoli? I get a headache, man. People have been eating broccoli forever.

Speaker 2:          01:27:35       Like, how's that possible? Like what? When did broccoli ever become something that you feel shitty after you ate? Has anybody ever said that? Like, I eat broccoli, I just fuck get hooks folks with my immune system. Dudes will claim that. Now these carnivore guys, a lot of them are claiming, look, I, I eat a fucking salad, bro. I'm off for awhile. People. I typed it in back at the other way. In general, broccoli is safe to eat. Any side effects or not serious? Most common side effect is gas or bowel irritation. Yeah. Broccoli farts caused by broccoli's. High amounts of fiber. All cruciferous. That's a great word. Cruciferous vegetables can make you grassy. Oh, gassy, but who's super gassy, gassy, or are you a scIentist or not? You? Fuck, okay. When you're a scientist, you scientific terms, you don't say gassy with me, but he's scared saying farts.

Speaker 2:          01:28:27       Gassy. But the health benefits outweigh the discomfort. yeah. So there's certain people like, um, that I think have a real physical issue. Like Jordan Peterson is wonderful when it describes like he, he literally can't have anything other than me and at this point in his life or it gives them headaches and it fucks with them. I think certain people may all bullshit aside, might have a real biological issue with vegetabLes, which sounds insane, but it only makes sense. People have a problem with everything is there's certain people that have a problem with almost everything. There's people that are to citrus as people that are allergic to certain cahtos yeah. All kinds of plants. There's people that are allergic to grass. Why wouldn't be allergic to some vegetables? So if you are allergic to some vegetables and you just go on an all meat diet, all those symptoms of those allergies go away.

Speaker 2:          01:29:19       Why wouldn't that make sense to people? I mean there's so many people fighting off the idea, this carnivore diet that you're only eating meat and you feel fantastic. You're probably dealing with a bunch of people that have undiagnosed interactions, negative interactions with vegetables. This is probably something about their system that does not go well with vegetables, so they should take vitamins. I take vitamins and eat meat and you better find a way to get fiber. Kids. I didn't want to get all backed up. Vegetables are good. I think if you eat like a really fatty meat though, you don't have that problem. If you eat like a ton of rib eyes, it just greases up that whole pipeline and you're like, ooh, everything comes flying out. I think when you start eating that lean ground bison meat, you know no butter. Like you're gonna have a problem for butterball.

Speaker 2:          01:30:11       Yeah. You chew that shit down and pack it down. Then you water on top of it. So it's like you go like the pack that bison here and then you've got the water behind that. It's concrete a fine. Find its way through your body. Have some broccoli, bro. Kill. Put some cheese on it. Some people really firmly believe that dairy is bad for you. And that's something I've never tried. I've never tried. You know, had dairy? No, no, no. To not have dairy. I've never tried to like way off 100 percent dairy. I don't eat much, but if I do it's mostly cheese. Hardly ever drink milk unless it's with cookies and whenever I do, I always feel weird. No. If I need milk I shouldn't. Myself.

Speaker 2:          01:30:49       I've been my whole life to them tolerate and I didn't even know that. My mom never told me, but every time I'm eating cheese I have problem against the stuff. It'll come out to him. So I fought with almond milk and soy milk now. Yeah. Do you fuck with vegan cheese? Everything big. only meeting no more. When did you stop? Why wouldn't have. Fuck my asshole blew up. That's good. Move. Fucked up the fiber. And you feel good though. You feel fat? People don't believe me. The theory. Vegan. You're a fucking fat. What crops do? Why are you opposed to eggs? Oh no, just the. Just give it all up man. I got so scared after I started bleeding man. And I said, you know what? God died on point. You feel better. I feel good. I mean I don't have. I don't have the runs. Know that shit on myself anymore. You ever try out this other types of diets or is this the first one? No, I tried being a vegan, I tried the atkins diet, I tried the hollywood diet, you know, when you wake up in the morning and do some coke and it sucked. I never tried that one.

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       Yeah. Um, do, are you trying to lose weight or you're good? No, I mean I, I couldn't lose weight but I was bigger than I am right now because of a. No, there's not really a diet. I just started this in 2011 or 2012. And you said when your ass was bleeding, that's when you decided that's where they started. Started off slow. I just stopped drinking milk first and then I thought was cheesed then meet with the hardest fish. Chicken little slow. And what do you replace it with? Like what kind of foods? My wife, she was raised vegan in dayton, Ohio by her mom dam and you know the and they were poor so they grew up in a, in a trailer park. So that must have been tough for them being vegan. So I just started little by little, it helped me because she will not be good at the time when I started being vegan.

Speaker 1:          01:32:57       I got it. I still love me, man. Like fuck. Yeah man. Like hamburgers, ribs, ribeye, lobster, jack in the box. Number five. Do you go and get your blood tested and get yourself checked out? I got my blood tested two years ago and I'm supposed to get my blood tested this week again, him two years ago. And how do you look like in terms of your vitamins, getting enough nutrients? Do they do all that kind of stuff? Tests your vitamin d levels. That totally took my b levels. It was for sugar and everything was cool. Yeah, that's good. He just told me that I could lose 30 pounds. Yeah. Well the first women I've watched your videos every once in a while I'll try to get into the ice thing. You got into the ice things rough. I want to know what's good to saunas. Saunas are usually nine degrees.

Speaker 1:          01:33:56       Is that like a different side of the head with the why? Mca right now? Saunas. The same steam rooms, dIfferent steam room is like if, if steam gets out or. Well it's a, it really is like in the implementation of it more than anything, but if he did, I'm a steam room, most likely was a tile floor and you go in there with a towel, Florida oil last door and it just hot steam and everybody just gets hot in there and then they get to sweating and they leave, but the song is different in that it's a dry heat so you go in there and it's usually. I think the idea is, and I could be wrong here, but I think the idea is that the steam room can't get as hot as a song because if it did, it would kind of cook you because it's wet. It would be like hot wet air around you. It kind of cook you as opposed to the hot dry air. That doesn't make any sense. It's touching little hot. The hot rocks at the sauna. The sauna. Yeah. It's because it's conducted waters, waters conducting the heat. That's what it is. Right? So the air doesn't conduct the heat as well. The water does. Okay,

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       so that's makes sense because of the sauna. You can get to a fucking, a crispy degree, crispy temperature before you body starts to freak out. That's like the old school. Highlight the rat pack, so not trying to sit around the song and party all night and then take a little steam in the morning, get all the alcohol. It doesn't really do that, but it doesn't make you feel a little better. Yeah. If you fucked up from drinking, you could also run the risk of could you might be dehydrated. You could run the risk of blacking out. You know, if you're. If you're susceptible to that and you look at them all there, he's on the phone, matches on the phone, is there in the sauna, landau, look at these guys. That's hilarious. Meanwhile, how'd the photographer get in there, but I call bullshit. I call bullshit the phone.

Speaker 2:          01:35:48       I call bullshit with the photographer during the ocean's 11 where we know probably really happened. I'm sure he did iT all the time and they said, yeah, come on in and take a picture of us. This is what we do. Guys were having a good time, highly. I remember the time they were having a good time man. Too. Crazy. Like in their fifties there, right? Oh yeah. They were older guys and they got together and they just did whatever the fuck they wanted and they'd go to vegas and party and everybody wanted to go party with them there at the sands there, the sand. The says. It's crazy. When you look at those old hotels and casinos in vegas, they just decided to dynamite item, but what would you give to to stay in the sands today if they kept everything up to date but current with the era in which it was created.

Speaker 2:          01:36:34       like if you went there, it was a total retro hotel room with like fucking dial up phones and you know, just. I mean there's god, there's something to be said for it, right? Like if you, if you live in a log cabin, like there's something really cool about a log cabin, right? Like you're, you're living in a way that people lived like this a thousand years ago. Man, this is real. This is really how people live. But no one wants to live like people lived in the sixties, you know, like if they had a place like that where you had all the same kind of furniture, just updated all the same law. Tensiles yeah. But have that shit like they had it back then. How many people would want that? Man, let me, like vegas was only made possible because of air conditioning. Oh yeah. Water. They couldn't have pulled that off if they didn't have some sort of way to cool the place down. When did that start? Because that's a good question. I've got a bit hottest shit. I don't. Well, the ice house where we do stand up was his 58 years old. Before that it was some sort of a, I think it was some sort of,

Speaker 2:          01:37:51       uh, an actual ice house where they bring it at, at some point. It's history. That's what it used to be. It used to be a storage place where people that didn't have frigerators yeah, that's what the whole place it would buy a block of ice and they would take this ice and they carry it home. Jesus christ. That wasn't that long ago, man. I mean that's less than 100 years ago. That's insane. So late 1947. Bugsy siegel flamingo. Yeah, I bet it. I bet it couldn't be. I'm going to take a guess. I feel like we've probably, we've talked about this already. I've just forgotten because I'm too stupid to maintain all this information anymore. My brain's overfilled. Um, I want to say it happened somewhere around the 19 twenties. The 19 fifties. What? There was no refrigerators for the fifties. Refrigerators. I'm sorry. Is air conditioning in vegas as I was looking at.

Speaker 2:          01:38:39       Oh, sorry, I missed. I'm sorry I was rambling. I was going with bulk of siena was going with a mango, so air conditioning and refrigeration. We're definitely, we went with the ice house, which is a blocks of ice that they used to use for ice boxes. When do you think they invented the refrigerator where they didn't have to do that for the refrigerator. The ice chest. So I'll check, but I think they pr man. So with air conditioning, the fifties. So the, the, the big roaring times of the vegas eruption was probably right after that and he had to be like right after it was invented. Well there was different type of condition that though the standard air condition that we have now, but I used to work at. I used to work at sears roebuck's and in boyle heights. It's an old sears building and they 87, it was a big earthquake and I was working there and that's in all the water came down. They have a swamp cooler so it's like a big show with a bunch of water in it. And that's a really an old aIr conditioner by the mid to late 1930 swamp coolers. Homes by maybe 15 degrees, but added humidity.

Speaker 2:          01:39:48       It was bad dude. swamp coolers. I liked the name and swamp coolers. It was luck. I had to clean one of them motherfuckers. Man. It was huge. It was bigger than that for the whole building that it's crazy. And it broke another one who came down. Yeah, man. Air conditioning. If you live in the northeast in the summertime, it gets wet. Like I lived in boston, there was a wet place like when, when the summertime would come around, you wouldn't, it wouldn't just be that it was hot out. It was hot and wet, you know, things get sweaty as fuck. Mosquitoes are everywhere. Yeah, real muggy. It's a weird feeling, but it's cool because you're, you realize it's not going to happen very long, you know, so like when, when it is muggy, the thing about like real contrast, whether that's one thing we just don't get in California, we don't get a contrast.

Speaker 2:          01:40:40       If you live in a place like New York, you'll have a summer that is brutally hot and muggy and people are walking around and sweating and they're like, holy shit, it's fucking hot out. Fuck fucking hot bag. But you'll also have a winter where you've got your shit pulled up to your face. You're fucking die and man, you can't wait to get on that train or the bus or hop in an uber. You just got to get out of this fucking cold. Oh, oh, you're in the cab and like take you to this place. Cab takes you to that place you all pile out immediately run inside, man. There's something about that that sucks at the time, but it's good for people who don't get the hill here, man. Right here in turns 70 leg warmers.

Speaker 3:          01:41:23       Oh yeah. People are hugging it up everywhere. They dug it up. I'm sort of bringing those boots too soon. They bring in the uggs when they weren't short. Girls are allowed to do that. We don't say shit. They can do whatever they want. Basically. They were running fashion for sure. They decide. Right. That's why fanny packs went away. it was because of girls don't like guys on all right. That's what happened. If I didn't pay, the tournament will come back. I remember that with a fanny pack. The only fanny pack away to get started on goes enamel. It was a fanny pack and then the inside had a holster for a little 38. Mm. Yeah. He tried to rob me son. This video that bert kreischer just put up on instagram of a dude pulling us pistol out, shoot himself in the leg, try to be quick, draw mcgraw

Speaker 2:          01:42:13       for the leg. He goes, I just fucking shot mYself and bert kreischer with all the tears coming out of his eyes. Ha ha.

Speaker 3:          01:42:23       He's so funny, man. Bert kreischer has a new netflix special coming out. August 24th netflix. Bert kreischer, I forget what it's called, a, but bird's to be here the night before. We're going to hype it up. Secret top secret time will shave sns chest for secret time. He's a cool dude. That guy. He's a very good dude. I've been on this podcast. He's a very good dude. Very good guy. We got a lot of good guys, but yeah, like comedy. Today's a good time. It is, man. It is. It's a great time. Funny peopLe

Speaker 2:          01:42:59       and cool people and it's fun. Yeah, it's fun. Fun and happy again that the whole time when I got that gig. Yeah, those were fun times, man. Tyler doubloons. Yup.

Speaker 3:          01:43:09       Go across the street. See chewy play. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:43:14       When everything's good like that, like it makes. It's good for everybody. It's like it makes the whole community is like more a more positive and it seems like we're helping out more young people coming up and then they develop a nice positive community too and they realize, hey man, we're all trying to get somewhere, but we're not against each other where we should be supporting each other and it'll help everybody. It'll help you. It'll help me. There'll be more positive vibes flowing around everybody. Be happy like we inspire each other. We were not competing against each other. Someone does well. Don't say fuck him. Say god damn he did it. I could do it too. You can see the amount of energy can be put into both ways of thinking about it, but one way is so much more positive for you and for everybody around you and still allows you to have a competitive instinct because you're still competing against yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:44:02       You competing to do better, but you're looking at the people around you as inspiration rather than its competition, and so you, instead of having this negative, combative relationship with everybody around you, that's also succeeding you have is really cooperative, excited, feeling about it. You know what I mean? That's, that's entirely possible in in business. That's entirely possible and friendship. It's like that's how people should try. They should aspire to interact, interface with things, always try to be as positive as you can to give the same amount of energy you can give towards positive and still fulfill all those same amount of instincts of like kicking ass and doing well or do it against yourself, like compete against yourself. Don't think about it as those other people are taking something away from you. Think about as they're giving you an opportunity to look at what's possible.

Speaker 2:          01:44:47       If you really dedicate yourself and you should choose that as a valuable life lesson like, wow, look at that guy doing so well or look at this girl like kicking ass and doing all this. How does she accomplish that? As you write all those things, how does she make all these movies? How does she do all these things like fuck, but people don't do that. The natural instinct is to look at someone who's like some crazy, like super competitive person, like the rock or something like that. Like you see the raW, he's in everything. He's in everything. You want to shit on him, but he's such a nice guy. You can't. It's a real problem that he could do. That guy could do terrible movie after terrible movie. No one cares because you such a good guy. You could. He could do whatever he wants.

Speaker 2:          01:45:29       He seemed like a nice guy. He's a very nice guy. He's a and he's the real deal. That's really what he does. I mean, that guy really does show up at a fucking hotel room. Four o'clock in the morning, flies across the world and immediately starts working out. Wow. He's an animal like a lead. You want to be inspired. That guy's worth more money than everyone. He makes more money than anybody that's ever made any money in movies. He's fucking junk or not. he's so out of control. Every movie does as a blockbuster. Meanwhile, he still shows up at a place they got to fucking dig, got one of them elliptical machines waiting for him. They got weights, weight, and for him he goes to town to do like 45 minutes of cardio when he fucking land flying across the world, lift weights for an hour. Like He just keeps going.

Speaker 2:          01:46:14       He just keeps going. He finds a way to not complain, stay positive and just keep going. I would have read half of his book and I'm very like, that's a lot for you. I remember that. Um, when you, when he was third string playing football in Canada, he was living up, it will show the mattress with the guy who got kicked out of a team. Jesus fog to be a superstar. I mean, I don't even know how many millions he makes a movie, but everybody sees his movies. He's such a good guy. But here, here's, be really clear, that kind of genetics,

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       like what that guy is that is just like we were talking about with Iceland. That's the same shit. That's the same shit with the pacific islands, man. That's some warrior dna son. That's a giant man. That's a huge, super powerful man who fucking is so driven like we are lucky. We are lucky. That dude is not on the biggest fucking horse he could find with the biggest battle ax. I mean that's what these people come from, man. You don't get to be that big if you don't have like some sort of a, a great lineage of warriors behind you. You mean this, that's so much bigger than most people because the schwarzenegger, he's so big, but all those guys like that guy that plays the mountain on game of thrones. Like what in the holy fuck that guy so big. You know the dat dude came out of some warrior bloodline, some crazy viking blood line because before guns, that was what was most important. So when you see a guy like the rock or you see a guy and you're like, wow, that guy looks like a conqueror. Yeah, because that's what he comes from 100 percent. Like is a worry warrior that due to place store. What's that dude's name? Chris hemsworth is home worth that. That dude. Listen

Speaker 3:          01:48:08       that, that dude. He's a goddamn specimen. Or aqua man. What is this jamie? Body comparison of the rocK to the mountain. Who is the mountain mountains behind them? One hundred 50 pounds on him. Oh my god. Oh, the mountain from game of thrones. Oh, sorry. Holy shit. Put that again. Look how much bigger he is. That's like,

Speaker 3:          01:48:30       that's significant. Integrate like six, seven inches. He's so big. A guy. So big. I'll tell you the six, nine or some shit. Yeah. Six. Nine. Dude, that is so crazy. I weigh more than both of them. That's not true. Oh, well no. The mountain weighs like three 93. 80 six. Three 86. He's six foot nine. He weighs 386 pounds. Like to put that in perspective. A former world boxing champion. um, fuck is his name. The crazy gypsy dude. I'm sorry chris. I know the guy. He's the last guy to beat vladimir klitschko. God damn it. How am I not remembering his name? Tyson fury, right? Yes, that's it. Sorry tyson. That guy's a beast. Tyson fury. He's six foot nine and he weighs 2:50 fam and he's a world boxing champion. He, he gave up the title, he was going through some struggles, some health struggles, some mental health struggles too, and gained a shitload of weight and then he got real fat and then got all the way down to like a super healthy way to get an. I don't know if he's box since I feel

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       like he has shit. Find out if he's box since. When was the last time he boxed? But he's going to bok soon. I know. and he looks he's in phenomenal shape. So when was the last time he fought? There's the wikipedia say I feel like the last time he fought his, when he outpointed vladimir klitschko and then afterwards he had a real struggle. Maybe just because all of a suDden it became, the champion is freaking out and maybe partying too much or something. Uh, in june. He fought just recently, right? Yep. Was literally last month. Yeah. Yeah. And who did he beat? Suffer severe. Did he beat him by decision? Uh, doesn't say, where is it? Decision. Rtd round for. What does that mean, referee something technical dakota? No, because it's td technical decision. Maybe it's a. If someone got headbutted and they got cut, what happened?

Speaker 2:          01:50:50       So find out what happened in that fight. So you just google the fight. We'll figure out what happened. Anyway, if you go to his instagram page, he's jack now. Shredded six pack pang pang. Pang looks great, but you gotta think he's 2:50. That big motherfucker who's the same height as him is a hundred and 40 pounds heavier than him. Just saying that as that is fucking insane. that's so big. Hundred 40 stakes. Take 140 t-bones. Just slap them all over. That dude's bought it. Just shocked that I used to be. Everything will be doing before acting doorman. Someone smashed when people just randomly. I don't know man. I don't know about anywhere, man. He's the world's strongest man though, is one of those guys. He does those worlds. Strongman competitions together. Fucking straw. The handles on the logs. They horst along fat twin after fourth round.

Speaker 2:          01:51:41       Say that again. The guy retired after the fourth. Oh, the guy retire. So he retired on his stool? No. So he said no mas sound like it was an interesting event. Was getting pissed and there was a fight with stand by. Was the Crowd getting pissed because the fight stopped because dude quit. Tyson fury is a beast. He's a really good boxer. But um, you know, he came up to weigh over 300 pounds, got real fat and then lost it all, got down to 2:50. He's smiling and laughing on his instagram. So like you figured it out. Like I like that. Like when someone goes to the park, lands then comes back. He's a big fucker. Look how tall he is. Six nine. And he can box his ass off. He's very slick, like deceptively slick. You know, he's a traveler. He's like one of them.

Speaker 2:          01:52:28       Bad ass gypsy dudes. Like there's quite a few of those in boxing right now. These are tough fucking people and he can perform under pressure to like, he, he gets loose. This huge man. He's so big dude. Kenny box. He can box hIs ass off man. I just don't know why this guy. So they're just standing in front of each other and like they were fucking around like two rounds and then he landed some blows. Go down here and see what happens. Let's see what happens at the end because if the guy just quit and there was no, there was no poInt where he was hurt then it's disgraceful stuff. So he's beating them up here? Yeah. Well tyson fury. So yeah, he's fucking him up. He's of the jet woRld championship caliber boxer. He beat vladimir klitschko in his prime. I mean at the end of his reign, but he was still in his prime because his next fight against anthony.

Speaker 2:          01:53:23       Joshua was fantastic. Klitschko knocked joshua down, had joshua deep, deep trouble. And then joshua came back and stopped him and joshua knocked him down first. Then he knocked joshua down second. So it was like anthony. Joshua was clearly, if not the best, at least it's between him and deontay wilder right now until they fight the best, most dangerous heavyweights of our era. And klitschko almost beat him, almost knocked him out. So when tyson fury beat him, before that he was beating a prime time klitschko and he just outboxed him man. So the dude just quit. What was he good? Was he getting beat up our. I was talking too much. No, go a little bit. A little bit more. So is the end of the round all the highlights. I mean theY probably should. Yeah, he, he was getting hurt. He was gettIng hurt for sure. He right there. He got hurt. But, but you gotta you gotta, you know, try to figure out a way to mitigate this. You know, you've got to figure out when. I mean he's going back to his, his corner. He's not wobbling. You're supposed to be trying to figure out a way to get past that dude. And if you can't figure out a way to get past that, dude, why'd you take the fight?

Speaker 2:          01:54:30       But I guess I guess he probably thought he could beat that guy before he got in with them. And then while you're in the middle of it, you know what happens? Who that happens to? Loma chanko, lemme chanko. God's just quit. Guys quit on their corner, worldclass guys, they're on their corner and they just go, fuck this. I'm not going back out there. There was like one of his more recent fights against a really high level guy, loma checkers. So good. He boxes guys out so convinced and they're like, look, I'm going out. Like this guy keeps teeing off of me. I'm not making it. We're cutting the shit short right here. And they'll do it with a straight face but like enough of this, but that's because he's so much better. Like what you've seen with tyson fury there. That guy was definitely getting beat up and maybe he definitely needed to stop that fight, but the way he's getting beat up is not like the same way loma chanko does.

Speaker 2:          01:55:17       Like when loma triangle does. It looks like the end is near son. You better get off this fucking train. We're going right into a brick wall. You think their mind's not in it when you just give up. Who knows man, I mean we didn't watch the actual fight. He might've tyson fury, most likely, I think probably hit them with some big shots and you know, we're looking at it from an outside perspective, but he knows he's in big, big trouble. It's a smart move. I mean people get they boo and they get angry when someone who's a real warrior steps out of fight, but I can

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       remember when nigel benn fought gerald mcclellan and it was a big, big fight at the time because they were both just knockout artists and crazy wild dudes with ferocious punching power and gerald mcclellan cut a shit ton of weight, really way too much weight and he was a really big light heavyweight and when he went in there and fought gerald mcclellan or when he fought a nodule band, rather, they had a clash of heads and it was a crazy like nonstop first round action where jeremy mclellan hurt. Nigel benn see if he could find that. Jeremy clough, gerald mcclellan hurt nigel benn knocked him through the ropes and looked like the fight was over and nigel band comes back. He gets back up and they're going at it and there's a crazy headbutting there too, and during the headbutt I mean they're throwing bombs back and forth, but I'm gerald mcclellan takes a knee shortly afterwards and then goes to his corner and stops and the, the people that are watching, I remember saying like, why is he doing that? Like why would he stop a fight like that doesn't make any sense. And then boom, he, he's fucked. And then they take them to the hospital. And this is it. This is what says around 10, right before, I think this is right before the headbutt. Yeah. So during the first round, I see, I thought it was a shorter fight through. During the first round they had collided and gerald mcclellan hit him with some big shots and it looked like the fight was over. I'm pretty sure that was the first round. But when,

Speaker 3:          01:57:12       when whatever happened happened. Oh, look at that right hand by nigel pen. Oh, that's ferocious. Oh dude. See, I totally remember this wrong. I remember a clash of heads. Look at that. I though, man. Damn, I 100 percent. Remember this wrong, see, because he got up and he's in trouble, and nigel ben's hitting them again. See, I don't remember him. See, that's interesting how that works, man. You haven't seen a fight in 20 years and you have this stupid memory to have it in your head. Oh, look at that upper cut he hit him with. So I think this is the end of the fight. So I think he was a greeley struggling at this point. I think he waited out his whole count. That's it. He waited out his whole count on his knee and I think some people were critical of that at the time. This is crazy, man. So anyway, after this fight, gerald mcclellan had severe brain bleeding and was taken to the hospital and he's never been the same sense.

Speaker 3:          01:58:21       Batman nodule ban was a beast man. They were both beasts. Gerald mcclellan was a knock out artist at the time. Man. See if you google jeremy mclellan, kao highlights the. The thought was that it was going to be one day joe mcclellen versus Roy Jones jr. They were going to have a super fight. That was like a big, like one of them pack. Y'all may weather type fights for that era. Wow, man. He got hit hard. Man. Ain't hard getting hit in the face like that. Why do I remember him getting head? Maybe I'm just completely delusional or maybe that was somewhere in that mix, but certainly it was the big bombs from mcclellan that, uh, dropped him in the first round and the big bombs from nigel benn. I want to see the first round too because from I remember it, it was a crazy comeback because nigel benn was really hurt and that first round, but just showed insane heart and figured out how to keep going where a lot of people like this fight is over. This fight is over.

Speaker 3:          01:59:23       But you see in those, uh, highlight reels. He was a knockout artist man. But now he's, he's in real, real, real, real bad shape. He's in a wheelchair. He from that fight. He, he went blind. He, uh, he had severe bleeding on his brain and it never really recovered. He could have died in the ring. Oh, he absolutely could have died. So here's the first route, look at this first round, insane you're going to with nigel benn falls through the ropes. Go, go back a little bit, go back a little bit so you could see how fucking insane this. Go. Go to the beginning of it. You see how insane this combination is. I mean, mcclellan came out, guns blazing and hit him with some serious bombs. Man, look at this. He hit him with a couple of good shot. They're good, right hand, a good lead hook left hook to the body.

Speaker 3:          02:00:08       So this is the beginning of the fight. You're thinking, oh my god, this is fucking over. Look at that left hook, left hook to the body. Boom, boom. I mean mclennan was a destroyer. Look at this and this is when he's blasting them through the ropes. You're like, holy shit. This fight is over. Nigel benn comes back from this to win like 10 rounds later, which is insane. Insane. Look at them. I mean clearly he's hurt. He's kinda wobbly. But jeremy mclellan just couldn't keep this up. Nigel benn survived and came back. Those are Like mad and tangibles in a fight. That's why the best description of fights is always the theater of the unknown because you really never know what the fuck is going to happen. When did you get these two world class knuckle slingers throwing fucking haymakers at each of the slickest mcclellan.

Speaker 3:          02:01:01       Oh, not Japan. Comes back with a right and he clenches now. Mclaughlin starting to get a little tired, right? Knees. They're given up. I'm to kinda. Yeah, I mean he's gotta think what kind of output he's putting. He's trying to win this fight and jail son and told me something once that's, uh, an old boxing, uh, saying something along the lines of if you try to stop a fight and win by knockout but fail, you almost always lose by decision because you just blow yourself out so bad. Obviously that's not totally the case because some people have crazy endurance

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       and they can try to win a fight by knockout and then recover around later. But did the amount of output that you do when you're throwing everything full blast like mcclellan did in that first round is insane. It's like sprinting, how many punches that up? First round, he threw a lot, but here's the most important thing. He's throwing a lot of them at full power. That's why it's so difficult to maintain. What most people don't realize is that most of the time we see boxers, boxing, they're throwing punches fast, but they're being loose and fluid and when they heard a fighter, that's when they expend the most energy because then they're digging in and drill and blast and they're winding up. They don't normally do that, so the amount of energy that it takes to wind up and throw your hips in your fucking ass into it and all you're waiting to explode at the end.

Speaker 2:          02:02:31       That's much more than to be just a technical boxer. So when they're throwing technical punches and they're moving fast, they're. They're not exerting the same amount of energy. See, when when you're trying to knock somebody out, like mcclelland clearly wasn't this first round. You are running uphill with a weight sack on your back and you can only do it for so long. So as we go into the second round, like look, you see he's already really tired, so it was as much headshot there. It was as much his weight cut as it was his strategy to try to win the first round as it was nigel ben's ability to absorb punishment and come back strong because ben is looking fantastic here in the second round look at them. But it was a big wake up call to a lot of boxers that if you engage in wild brawls, even when you were one of the elite of the elite, like gerald mcclellan was at the time, you could still get, you know, brain bleeding and be fucked up.

Speaker 2:          02:03:26       And a lot of people attribute that to the weight cut because he had a, he a dehydrate himself quite a bit back then doing his game plan from his coaches. Get this guy out in the first round. It could be, but it could be that he heard him and he figured he could get them out in the first round. You know what I mean? Mcclellan was a killer. THat was his thing. If he, if he hurt you, he was coming after you. So what's that? 14 straight knockouts and 10 were in the first round. Come on man. That's what gerald mcclellan did. So when it didn't work out against a guy like nigel benn, nigel benn figured out how to maintain his energy better in that fight. That's a, you know, that's a dangerous strategy. Empty all your bullets out in the first round. He was just on the fence for the first three relevant.

Speaker 2:          02:04:07       But meanwhile, like the, that's what was his success formula up until then. you know what I mean? That was, that was what was working. You don't know. It doesn't work until they don't work anymore. 14th street and I called that way. Yeah, I mean do, do you remember when we used to think that nobody can beat tyson? Remember? Do were little when we were young we thought, I think it was like, when did he lose 86? did he lose in like 1986 to buster douglas? Yeah. What year was that? 80 nine. 90 google that. Um, he moved. He did it. What it was. I was definitely doing comedy at the time and I definitely saw it with my friend ron after the fact. Great. Eleventh, 19, 90, 1990. Damn. So from that point on, we knew he could lose before that. Every tyson fight like, man, I'm not gonna bother watching.

Speaker 2:          02:05:01       Why do people want even want to fight that guy just getting killed. What were the odds of him when he like 40 to 42 to the one. Somebody got paid. Somebody I paid some crazy number. I think it was 42. I think it was one of the highest underdogs ever. That one. 40 2:42 and he won by knockout. Buster douglas was fantastic back then, man. You fucked him up. Well dude, buster douglas is a crazy example of a guy who always had a tremendous amount of talent. He was always regarded as like people that were in the know and boxing. I'd heard them talk about him and they would always talk about how smooth he was in training and when he's at his best. He's literally like a world championship fighter, but he never totally put it together in far as far as discipline and training camp, but then his mom died and he decided he was going to fuck Mike Tyson up for his mother.

Speaker 2:          02:05:54       Trained really, really hard, so it was a perfect storm of Mike Tyson being king of the world. You know, he's just fucking. Everybody up doesn't even feel like he has to train anymore. He's just just being. He's just being the world heavyweight champion. That's what. That's what they're like. The reason why they become that guy in the first place because they have this ability to indulge and excess and go crazy. He's buying tigers and lamborghinis and shit and all along the way, buster douglas fir that fight train like a demon and still almost lost. Still almost lost. That's how good tyson was when tyson was in his prime is a knockout artist. He was so lethal that even though buster douglas and him fought in bus, doug's eventually wind up knocking him out. He knocked him out after Mike Tyson knocked buster douglas down and had him hurt and don king after the fight even protested and said that the, the count was more than 10 and that when buster douglas was down, the referee gave him an extra couple of seconds to recover that he shouldn't have had.

Speaker 2:          02:06:55       I remember that was like a big protest after the fight, but even then, I mean we even with shitty training, you know, be not taking this guy seriously at all. Even then Mike Tyson still knocked buster douglas down and almost knocked him out with one punch. What? Run tHe locomote. wasn't douglas the longest, longest tyson fight ever had, right? I know he's had decisions. He had decisions. Yeah. I think he had decision against bone crusher. Smith video here as both both knockdowns simultaneous. So you can see like the different 10 counts I guess. Okay. Let's say it. Boom. He clipped him an upper cut, right? There's

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       three, four, eight. These atlanta three on the left. He's like, I'm five or six on the right. Oh, that's so different. Oh, that's so different. He was cultivated. Yeah. Yeah. Oh man, it was the end of the round was the very end of the round, so buster got a break. So look that. That's just how it go. Go. Go to the very beginning again. Please take a second. Go at the very beginning again so I could see the punch right there. Boom. Look at that opera. That's a beautiful uppercut. Tyson nailed them with two to three. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. You're out. You're out. Buster. Buster there. No, he's out. He's out. Like do that again. That seems like he's out right, doesn't it? Yeah, let's try it again. Ready? Boom. He goes down. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

Speaker 3:          02:08:41       he's out. Someone's distracted him. A number eight. Yeah. Does that stopped the account? Is that how that works? As long as a lot of paul's second when it turns her running away. Seven, eight on Mike Tyson here. There's five, six, seven, eight. Just like none. Real quick. 10. Yeah, that guy's way quicker. Is that the same guy? Oh, that's ridiculous. Dude. You suck at counting in spanish and other one. That's a fucking crazy hard job, man. You're in the middle of the moment. You know there's all this hype going on and pay the fuck out. Yeah, but it's the same guy because a, it's the same fight. So how, how does the same guy count? Real slow for buster douglas and way faster for Mike Tyson. A description of the video says this clearly demonstrates that he gave them both the exact same amount of time. Oh really?

Speaker 3:          02:09:37       That's not what I thought was. So let's try that again. Let's try that again. Let's count for tyson will count for tyson first. Ready tyson goes down. Boom. What a combination. Plus two, 3:00, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. You got knocked down a run around 50 on the, on the clock. On the screen. You can see it in. How many seconds was it a. He puts them up at 38 is when he knocks on the track right there. Okay. She's like 13 seconds. Yeah, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. They're both out both out. Do the counting is definitely slower on buster douglas with. They're definitely both out, but either

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       way, if you said seven, I bet butts in instead of, you know, for if you've sped the count up by a second, you don't think buster douglas could've gotten up quicker. I bet he could have. I mean he was waiting for the guy to hit eight so he stands up. Right. Which what you do, you take as much time as you can, especially after you got legitimately hurt like that. You're supposed to do that. So the question is like, would he have been able to. If the guide countered a little quicker and eight came where seven was or six was, would have been able to. I think he probabLy would have the questions would have tyson and been able to get to him with one punch before the bell that might have knocked him out. Yeah. You know. Okay. Fight. You get them back up again and it's three extra seconds at tyson.

Speaker 2:          02:11:15       Storms forward and connects with it to head shots with a faithful dude. Crazy shots. There's this guy right here. Watch the fight glove. See the official counters? The fda? Yes. This guy that's the finger bro. He's famous. His nickname is the finger. He counts way faster. watch. Let's watch the finger. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Oh yeah. By the fingers count. That dudes out there both out cold. I'm going with the finger forever. Captain white glove. Michael jackson. Michael jackson will go with mike magician. Yeah, man, that's a. That was an insane fight though because you couldn't believe Mike Tyson could lose. Even when I watched it. I remember I heard about it first and then I watched it and they still remember thinking, I can't believe what I'm watching. He's going to get up and he's going to knock this dude out for sure.

Speaker 2:          02:12:10       Believe you lost. It was like, it's over. Then you couldn't believe that he could lose who that's people don't understand today. There's never been someone that was as dominant for as like a scary moment in boxing history than Mike Tyson because even though you knew Roy Jones is gonna fuck up, whoeveR he found the way he was going to fuck off, but he knocked him out with one punch. It wasn't going to be this horrific storming by destroyer, just common after your soul. Roy jones had box your face off, hit you with the lead left hooks and straight right hands that are way faster than anything you can duck. He would fuck people up, but he fucked people up with a certain style and movement and speed. Whereas tyson, which just mugging you at the same time, it's like all anger, so fast hood and you end.

Speaker 2:          02:13:00       He was solid like sledgehammer 220 pounds, but moved like 160 pound guy like he couldn't believe it at the time. They had never been a heavyweight like him before. There was heavyweights that that moved amazing like ali ali had the most amazing footwork of anybody just smooth and flowing and change what the game was. It was in front of people. The ropeadope, this a crazy video of volley that someone had on their instagram page, one of those boxing pages where he's fighting someone and the guy throws two, three, four punches in a row and ali's got his hands down. I just barely moving his head away with each punch. Just like pitch, you can't hit me. He just had a. There was a magic about what he was doing that you were like, how is a heavyweight moving like that tyson jab to tyson was a totally different kind of strategy, you know, and those, those strategies will be argued to the end of time.

Speaker 2:          02:13:53       Like what would have happened if Mike Tyson had a thought, muhammad ali, both in their primes. What would have happened, man, what have happened. It would have been fucking crazy. I'll tell you that if we had Mike Tyson in his very best before shit went completely crazy. He started giving out rolls royces. Two cops walking around with his tiger in his underwear before all that stuff. They. Yeah, before for sure. Before bite nears. The bioneers thing was when amanda was, you know, when a van or beat him in that first fight, no one could believe it. No one could believe it. Even though tyson did last. Buster douglas, everybody assumed that tyson last because he hadn't been training and he really hadn't been been focused and then when he went to jail, came out of jail and he looked jacked member way more jacked. Hit a ridiculous six pack. Remember that shit to another phase son. Now he got the tattoo on his face afterwards, right after jail I think at the tattoo. On his face. Angel, right? I don't think so. I think he had mild tattooed on his arm. What does it say here? Mike tyson opens up. Oh, that was when he got arrested by that joseph though. Joe, our pio guy had to do time in that Arizona. He was living in Arizona for a while and he had to do that. Joe, our pio shit, when they maKe you wear pink, got handcuffs on and

Speaker 4:          02:15:16       dude.

Speaker 2:          02:15:17       Mike Tyson though. When he was in his prime, like that was the one he just got out of jail. That was the Mike Tyson fresh jelic just act does 95 first fight after release. That was against a some unfortunate white fella that looks like he would be a. What was his name? Peter mcneely. Yes. Peter mcneely. Tough guy. Just wasn't the video of him talking to hype up. The fight is hilarious. You should go watch it now. No, he's hilarious. He was like a a guy who'd be carrying the money bag. He'd be a guy that you'd say bring them to peter and peter would break your face. Hey, you owe money. Fuck, boom. He was a irish guy. I remember him. Give me some volume. Jim gray, looking young and dapper for just a moment. Before you go out into the ring. Your thoughts. Tyson,

Speaker 6:          02:16:11       my grandfather, my grandmother, my father, my mother, my three brothers. Last but not least, snobby.

Speaker 7:          02:16:33       Mr mcneely. what was it that you have told your son? Huh? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. It last but not least. Medfield. Medfield man. A guy from medfield. Dat. Dat is a guy from beN.

Speaker 2:          02:16:48       if you've ever been to medfield, Massachusetts. No disrespect. That makes sense.

Speaker 1:          02:16:53       Fucking fears in the house. Dorchester.

Speaker 2:          02:17:00       That's hilarious. Low tough. Lowell lowell is a big one. Man with hardcore micky ward came from lowell. I want me and my friend jimmy last. We saw micky ward box, somebody, some famous dude. I feel like he bought some old, some old time to it. Jimmy just told me about this recently too, and I forgot what it was, but we were both like, couldn't have been more than like 19, something like that. We went to see micky ward box was crazy man. Going to see live boxing. So weird because there's no commentary. Like I'd only seen it at home. Do you ever see a live boxing match? It's weird. It's oddly quiet. You know? What does it say greg young that where he fought in 95, 85. Oh yeah, that makes sense. That's probably exactly it. That means I was 18. Yeah, yup. Yeah. Lawrence, Massachusetts. He fought. I guess it was this guy greg young. Why did I think it was an older guy? A couple more right here, I guess in the same spot next year. Oh, okay.

Speaker 2:          02:18:07       Yeah. I don't remember any of those names. Unfortunately. I erased all that. Edwin caret. Hold on when? When correct. Go back up. That was in atlantic city. Edwin credit is like a old, old school as first loss. Tough dude. Yeah, he lost a correct crit was a beast. Micky Ward man. Those fights with turo, gadi. Those are some of the all time, most exciting and barbaric boxing matches ever when two dudes are just that close to each other like that close skill wise, like when they go out and just back and forth and back and forth. And nobody quits that. Those fights were insane. Man.

Speaker 1:          02:18:44       My dad, um, he, he loved boxing. He's toured the glove box scene to watch mexican boxing at the forum, hastily able every tuesday nights they used to be these crazy mexican boxer, but they were all featherweight lightweight. There was a guy named rubin olivarez was lightweight, pepino cuevas, and there's this guy who was cuban guy who will. Awesome. Mom. I'm nepalis mckenna for less or less what's happening in Mexico. He fought hearns, right? He hit him up. Hey man, fuck them up. but that's true. That is way too, man. Yeah. My friend does boxing now at um, uh, with a bet with duran. Does the box seat now

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       and um, for a golden boy, no shit. Yeah, they are boxing. Do my friend announces a fights? Oh, because they have um, they have boxing every once in a while in downtown la at some regular hotel at a club. And they have like young boxers. He says ring set. And he commented a lot of young incoming boxers. No shit man. Yeah man, that's a, that's a crazy gig. So as he traveled around with tattoos, he'd go into all these international, local, the local ones, like he does local ones like it when they fight over there and stand up for spring casino or more wrong go those type of fights. It was a good time right now for boxing. Oh yeah. Married. Very exciting match ups. a lot of people. Canelo and triple g. Whew. I can't wait for that rematch. Me too. I'm performing the day before of where I'm going to be at the hard rock cafe the day before the fight.

Nobody hit nobody hitting a wall. Nobody drive crazy. Don't do anything stupid. Jesus christ. You're dealing with like you going to be there right time. Crushers. What day is that? I've been november or November 3rd. I like watching shit at home, man. I want to go there. Too many humans. You know, everyone's jammed in. I have to do that so many times for the ufc. You know when I'm not working for the ufc, I like to be home watching you watch it with your friends or loan, chili.

Speaker 2:          02:21:10       That bowl. Sometimes I just want to watch it by myself, but a lot of times the only time I'm watching fights by myself with ufc fight, I'm not commenting. It's because we don't have a fight companion, you know? Like if we're doing. We do tHese fight companions. Like if we're home, it's like a home and shop and eddie bravo.

The number one family in the history of jujitsu, I mean by and arguably the number one family in the history of all martial arts. I mean, that's a debate that people will have to the end of the time, but that, that is a, it's a pretty strong candidate for the number one most influential family in the history of martial arts. Whoa. Hold on. How did they get started with that?

He was like [inaudible], just like a login enforcer, like a big british guy, you know, he wasn't, he didn't get that fat at all. But when he got that fat was also, when he got that funny, it was crazy. Like he just didn't give a fuck anymore with anything, with food, with anything partying. It became just a monster.

Speaker 1:          02:27:49       No, it's crazy. When, um, when we were on last comic standing, they do like a background check of everybody. Yeah. And I noticed like some people were slowly disappearing, you know, from the last comic standing because that background check criminal records. Some people were taken out of the photo, like they were put in positions. But you will take the photos. My brother, he committed a lot of crimes and he, he, um, I didn't know it then he stole my identity. Oh no, it was nbc investigated a couple notes here man. I see two files on your own to open cases on you. One of them for possessions of crack cocaine, possession of sale, fader to go to court. This is your brother's also gay noise. Have another brother who's not gay. He's a, he's a criminal. He's the one that came. That was one that keeps coming out of prison or worse.

There's no photo anywhere. So I had to track down his daughter on facebook and said, man, is there a picture of you and your dad somewhere? ANd she sends me the photo of my brother and then they do the comparisons of me and him and they let me go. That's hilarious. That is hilarious. They have photos of him like committing crimes. Like yesterday, camera photo, hearing court when everybody got arrested for leap as far as uh, my brother knows my birth certificate. He know my birthday and he knows my name. So what an asshole shit, bro. My other brother, the gay one, your own brother out and shit. And my, my other brother, the gay one, he got pulled over for a traffic violation and saves your name to my brother.

Speaker 1:          02:29:40       My brother used his name and my brother was, was um, they, they put him in a prison in Arizona for illegal immigrants also. Your brother use both of your. Yes. Oh my god. So my brother, my gay brother fernando was on his way to prison in Arizona for a crime he didn't commit. Oh no. Luckily for him, when he was locked up, a guy that was with me in rehab knew me and he, he, he, he, um, my brother and him were friends and he and my brothers back in prison a few days. Can you imagine going to jail because your brother's a piece of shit and he used your name to commit crimes. How fucking mad you stole my identity in prison knowing that this motherfucker risky or your freedom just so that he could get out. He's like, fuck cam, cam. you don't call me anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:30:27       I'm fucking social security number. I know his name. I know his birthdate. I know her heart, her heart. I'll here. That's so crazy. What a psycho. Damn man. You can't pick your family problem. Problem for some folks, right? You can't pick your family man. Like anybody who thinks that there's a, hey, you fucking get what you deserve in this world. Bullshit. Little babies are born in a fucked up families. You know, sometimes your brother is a piece of shit. He's a piece of shit before you're even born. You didn't even know. And you're born Later and he's just ready to dominate you and be a fucking asshole to you. And you're like, what? You know? That's what happened with gangs. Con games. Con became games con like later in his life. But when he was younger, he killed his brother because his brother was stealing fish. They would go fishing, his brother would take his fish. He was like, oh, for real. So he got with his other brother

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       and they fucking ambushed their older brother and killed him with a bow and arrow killed his brother. What did dad say? Mom was really pissed. Shouldn't let dad's deal. He shouldn't have let a my brother steal my fish. Fucking lock key parents latch key. What does it? Let's imagine that I'm in killing your brother with a bow and arrow. life was cheap back then or choking him to death.

Speaker 6:          02:31:46       Jesus christ

Speaker 2:          02:31:49       or choking him to death because the mob or whatever you're associated with, your brother got to go. So you don't know where your brother is now? My brother probably is somewhere running around in Mexico. Living in tj? Yeah. does he ever come back? No, no, no, he lived in lower there. Um, he, he works at some pick apart area over there. Pick apart. He had like a pickup part. You go there for parts for your car. Stolen car park. No, it's illegal. But you go in there. He told my brother, I'm looking for a, for a door for us. Seventy nine toyota and my brother go, yeah, you're going to go over there. Junkyards junkyard. Yeah. Yeah, man. I know dudes who built cars. They would, they would go to junk yards. Like, ah, I gotta get this fender are going to get a good fan of her [inaudible] 70 chevelle.

Speaker 2:          02:32:35       I go and look. And that's kind of fun. You know, if I had 100 lives, one of the things I do is build cars. I think that'd be the coolest shit in the world. You know, I envy the fuck out of people who have done that or have the time. Yeah, that's the thing is at the time. But people who have learned how to do it and get a frame and figure out how to get the frame all sandblasted and powder coated and then figuring out how to put the suspension on and fenders and to really take a car apart and restore it and restore it and have it looked beautiful. Then drive around in it. You see those guys that do that and go, wow, that's an admirable quality. There's like, that's like something very few men, whatever do. But every man admires him, man, and could do it.

Speaker 2:          02:33:18       Like, oh, me and my brother, we restored this 1969 camaro. I remember I read that matt hughes did that. Matt hughes, who was also at the tIme ufc welterweight world champion also restored classic cars. That's a man. That's a fucking man. Like if you take it, you could rebuild a car and then get it to the point where you did that. That's a. That's a manly activity right there to life. that's one of the most manly things you can do. Rebuild a car. Guys would work on their own cars. That's a rare breed son. My that always worked on his car, man. He never went to the mechanic. Yeah, he will go out. He'd be up there like changing the spark plugs out of the 73 impala by himself in the rain

Speaker 6:          02:34:08       dude,

Speaker 2:          02:34:10       changing them to. He be out there In the parking lot, man. Like all over like team his own stuff to take the motor out of the car

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       and put a new motor in and put it all in different kinds of man. And I'm in like in my, like elaine, like most dads would invite you a flipper career. Help me out. My dad, they want to know help. the first time I tried to help you know what? Go peel your fucking toys. You just pet me the wrong ranch hassle. Oh, judgmental daddy thing is to like date. They get locked into that. They don't want you to distract them. That's the word they're escaping escaping by working on this car and wrenching things down. Change, carburetors and shit. And those guys who could do that. That's a special type of guy. There's like this, a special mechanic man, like, you know, um, you know, a guy could do it because we're, when you invite those guys to get together. Yeah, they always look dirty.

Speaker 1:          02:35:05       He clean. Like, even even if you bring your, your, your invite, you're cool mechanic for the neighborhood to a party and you're wearing a tux, you'd be like, damn, there goes joel. He still looked dirty. Oh, he's got crazy fingernail dirt grease under their fingernails. It just never comes out. You don't recognize him standing up. Hey, here's a question. How many, how many people get sick from working in gas stations? I would think that like working in a gas station, all those fumes, like, that shit's got to be terrible for you. Fumes and then all the grease and oil and smashing your fingers and stuff. Oh, that's the worst. Whereas guys are always smashing their fingers and losing tips. Taping them. Fuck man. They know the kid. They used to be a guy that used to fix, you know, the toys of guy that in the neighborhood that don't have to fix everybody's car.

Speaker 1:          02:35:59       Right, right, right. And it was a guy named eli and they'll come with, they were a big family. There were like nine or 10 people in their family, but this guy will fix your car. But he also likes to party, like party hard joe, like, like. But he was the star, but he was a volkswagen genius. Oh, bugs. Bugs were his thing. But he also was a main drug addict. This is my friend juni. He was getting his bug fixed from him. He had a rag. Top was the oval bag with beautiful bug. This guy, eli man smoked pcp. Oh no. He just holding him, holding the wrenches and staring at the bug for like three hours straight. Not doing shit. Wow. Volkswagen. A different kind of car, man. I could bug you. Drive a bug. that's a different kind of human. You got to be a bug. Guys would know how to fix a bug. My friend jimmy, that same friend that I went to, the boxing match to see mickey word fight. He also had a bug hit, a blue bug. It was the most ridiculous car. I remember being in it like we were laughing how silly it was because it was so, uh, he love cars, right? Oh, love. Cause I remember, I remember, um, you and eddie griffin in the same car and his was dead. two years

Speaker 2:          02:37:15       was clean. Well his arms was cool man. You will come into a man like the fucking, like the cleaner in shit like harvey chi town. And I was like, you know what I mean, she gave me one of those, what they cars are fast dude. It wasn't the fastest car. She looked cool. Well here's the thing about those cars, man. They were really well balanced. Like it was a good amount of power for the size of it. It was a very light car. Like I want to say like the acura nsx wasn't even 3000 pounds. That Was it. I had a silver one. Ferrari. Somebody bought mine, you don't know at two silver, one with the wolf had a silver one in like the late nineties. And then I had a silver one and the early two thousands. That's my. That's it right there. That was my car.

Speaker 2:          02:38:03       That's It right there, so somebody owns it. Somebody bought it because I think I traded it in when I got something else, but it was a joe rogan. Thanks for modeling it to perfection. That guy's got it. That's my car to this day. That was one of my all time favorite cars. Definitely not the fastest car ever drove, but it wasn't about being fast. It was about like the experience of driving. It was More real. Tactile. It's a very light car and it's a mid engine car seats with low right bucket sEats and it's a japanese car. It's a honda so you know it's never going to break. I never had a problem with those. Like I had two of them. I had one, I had it for like three years when I traded it in and then I got this other one later, but in between I had a porsche and that shit broke down constantly.

Speaker 2:          02:38:48       I had a 99, 19 or nine, nine, six turbo, which is like two thouSand two. That shit broke constantly. It just kept breaking man. All kinds of crazy shit. Like the shift, linkage blue, two separate times where I would go to shift gears and it just disengaged and was floating around on two separate occasions that happened where I couldn't shift gears and I was stuck one time. Luckily it happened while I was driving down the road, so it was driving down the road and it popped loose and I was in second gear. I said, okay, I'm going to wind this bitch out and get to the porsche dealership. So I kept in second gear, just drove around and second gear through the streets, like near ventura. Ridiculous. They just weren't, they weren't durable bathroom. That porch. That's the new one. So no, I wasn't. I wasn't really into driving fast.

Speaker 2:          02:39:35       What I'm, what I like is a car that corners really well, you know, I like a car like that. Just it has a connection to the road, dude. Look at that thing. That's the new nsx. That shit looks preposterous. That's a preposterous looking vehicle like knight rider. yeah. With. The only problem I have with this car is the problem I have with all these cars, they won't let you, uh, use a manual transmission. They don't sell them with a manual transmission. The problem with that is, come on man, we're not racing like I want. I want it to feel good. Like if it feels people need to remember how much better it feels to drive a manual transmission. everybody wants to not learn. And since a lot of people don't know, I never learned that's the problem because they don't want to stall out and look like an asshole.

Speaker 2:          02:40:19       That's too much work. Once you learn how to Drive, he's still stalled out. I stall out occasionally. But the fund that you have with a car like that with a manual transmission is so different. So you're engaged, you're shifting things first. Man, there's something cool about that. And for whatever reason, people are forgetting that it's a totally different experience. when you drive a car that has a manual transmission versus a car that's not a magnet. more control, right? Well, not really. Honestly, you're better off with the automatic if you want to be totally honest. The automatic is going to go faster. It's going to have a better choice of gear selection than you are. It's going to like like a lot of times when these race car drivers to take like an automatic porsche, like one of the new ones, they take it on track. They don't even take it out of automatic. They don't shift the gears themselves. If it's a double clutch gearbox, they put it in drive and they just go because things are so good at picking the right gear. Why fuck around, so it's better that way really is better. You have more control of the car that way, but that's not necessarily what makes it the most fun than what makes the most fun is you're engaged in the car, you're shifting the gears, but smooth car. Yeah. Quiet. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:41:34       He could learn how to drive a stick. It's not hard. I did it one time. This guy taught me in rehab. Huddah hood drivers take shifts. We're going downhill though. Oh well that's ridiculous. Uphill and it was the worst, the top of los anica you get to the top of laci and you're right when you get the sunset, it's like a super steep hill. You've got to have an outbreak, and the new ones they don't have. He breaks the new ones have a bullshit button, e-brake, so you'd have a handle that you just lift up and lift down those nonsense. Fix that. Like that's the whole deal. If you're stuck in, unlike san francisco street, oh my god, and need a red light and you got to go forward and in a stick shift. That shit isn't heart attack inducing. I'm always afraid of rolling back on that car.

Speaker 2:          02:42:15       Of course, yeah, you have to have an emergency brake and it's hard to do when you're a young kid and you're learning how to drive one and you want a crazy steep hill at the top of the hill. There's a stopLight like, oh no, that's designed for automatic cars. If you have a stick shift, that's a fucking pain in the ass, man. I can't even read a motorcycle. Motorcycle stall out too, right? Same way. So most motorcycle guys would probably be able to transition to a stick. Pretty easy, pretty simple. Being a neutral. Yeah, I don't. I never wrote him a motorcycle. It took some classes for a little bit. But then while I was taking classes, a couple of people I knew wiped out pretty bad. I was like, fuck this, this is too dangerous. Ceo wrote a mini bike one time. And um, where were they in san jose? This comedian named butch. He let me ride it. Many bucks. Cool. Someone without too much power. It's cool. It's when you get into

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       these like high abuses, you know, you could just go and buy something that goes zero to 60 in a second. The fuck is that. You can just sell that to somebody. You. All you have to do is get a license. You get a license. And the dingo by the most insane two wheeled vehicle of the world could have ever. You couldn't even imagine something like this existing 100 years ago, like 100 years ago, if you went back to what, 19, 18 and somebody got a higher boost and brought it to you. He be lIke, what the fuck is this? What is this that the rocket? Yeah, this is. This doesn't even make sense. People would try it and go flying off of it. We would do wheelies and fall on top of them. They'd be like, what in the fuck is this? What are you doing with this thing? And then someone could show it. Someone who knows how to ride some real motorcycle race car driver guy, evil knievel. now like one of those guys that does this aisle of. What's that irish? Is it isle of man? What does that irish. A crazy race. They do where these people are. They're goIng so in sanely fast and it looks like they're going through the woods and shit. I can do this.

Speaker 3:          02:44:23       Is that it is isle of man? Yeah. Why is there a car there in front? Is the car for the cars driving with them? Oh, that guy just wiped out right there, son. Or these people that are driving

Speaker 3:          02:44:38       when it's not the race. This might just be your normal time. There might be doing their own race or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe so. I think so. Hey, this is the actual race. This is the isle of man race and I don't think they allow cars on the road while they have the race. But do these guys go fast as shit? It's crazy. They take hills and they're flying through the air when they hit the hill. So I look at that. Fuck bro. What is this like a fast. He's going 171 miles an hour right there. Yup. And people to the left and to the right. That is so insane. Bikes are so insane. And the fact that, you know, this is a fairly new thing in human history. I mean this is new. Within the last hundred years we had anything that you could do that with this speed that they could do it with. now it's just fucking crazy man. Like your, your moment where you have to make a decision. like if something jumps out in front of you, how much time do you have be? I'm still waiting for the jet pack. Could look. People are fucking stupid that someone wouldn't want to just go, I'm going to run when he comes by, as soon as I see them, I'm going to run and I'm going to get out of the work and then he tries to correct for you and wipes out there. Watch.

Speaker 3:          02:46:01       Yeah. Yeah. It's like he was doing a wheelie before he could even get off. God this was that. You

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       have to be so tuned in like I don't think we could even imagine how heightened your senses have to be to be able to stay on top of this where there's cars to the left and right and from you that alert man trees and shit. His trees everywhere. These guys are animals. Look at him. Fly over the top like that. Fuck. That is so bananas. That is. We watched them in. There's a video in real time with them all going over this hill. Yeah. It's like that. Like zoom. You really get a sense of it right there when you're. When you're riding in the pov there pov, you get a little bit of a sense of it, but you really get a sense of it when you watch them pass by stationary cameras. What else? These guYs are. My cousins sort of like this. I know they like crazy people that pilots, fighter pilots, guys that go.

Speaker 2:          02:46:59       There are risk taken fools man, and again, this is just like what we were talking about, what those strong men dudes. These are the peOple that are. They're hard Wired to do incredibly dangerous things and I guarantee you these same people that are hardwired to do these kinds of dangerous, risky things. They would be like special forces operators. They would be navy seals. They would be either. They would be people that are most scenarios, yeah. They can do things that other people probably don't have the nerves for and they're thrill seekers like, but then you could take a thrIll seeker that maybe would have joined the military and put a meal on a bike or put them In an mma cage or put them in a boxing ring and you get that same type of person like that. Those people all exist because you needed those traits.

Speaker 2:          02:47:47       You needed those traits in order to be successful, to keep your civilization alive, needed big, strong, murderous people. You need people that were crazy and weren't afraid of danger. You need a risk takers. You need to reward seekers. You needed people who wanted to be the king and if you didn't have that, you weren't going to survive because there's other people that had that on the other side. That's what's crazy is we're figuring out how to filter that shit into sports now and all sorts of other aspects of life, but it's these same instincts that have been around for hundreds of thousands of years that have turned people into what they are right now. Fuck man. It's a trip really as a trip when you think about people, just people in general, like what? The paths that people take to become who they are right now to be this guy on a jet pack going 100 miles an hour down a street.

Speaker 2:          02:48:35       How fast is he going? Delivery. We'd very, very fast. Very fast, right? Yeah. He's flying. Jesus christ. This is one, but this is not. I don't think the fastest one. This one, it looks like a halo of jets around them, but there's another guy that has one that are on his arms like, like iron man. This is pretty new to. This was like the earlier this month. You know they're going to get it. If batteries get any better, god would festival of speed. Yeah, they're gonna get it. They're going to figure it out. We're going to get hummingbird, bro. That's what it's going to be. His have some shit. Well, it's like, well, you're goIng to buy some cheap ones. You know some from genki ones from overseas and the hummingbird wings going to break off and hit in the fucking head. There'll be people to in delta knockoffs wings. Yeah. And then it would definitely be trippers that would put like glowing lights on them that would cause people to have seizures. You know, like for sure like burning man style lights over your hummingbird wings. That would be amazing. Come on. There'll be one of the coolest things of all time.

Speaker 2:          02:49:43       Burning man hummingbird. Glowing flashing light wings.

Speaker 2:          02:49:48       That'd be bad ass. Yeah, man. Burning man. This artist wants to cover burning man in a massive nasa engineered blanket. It's like 10,000 square or it. Sorry, 100 square meters. For what to trip? Fall. What would happen? It's supposed to reflect 97 percent of the heat that would normally stay down there. So they're going to do a portion of it. I don't know if they're going to take. Obviously can't cover that. It's funny, I was just reading about this. They tell you to take one of those space blankets with you. If you're going hiking in the woods, I'll give you go on a camping trip. And um, you know, you have like some survival stuff, a survival kit. One of the things they say is to get one of those because you build a fire and then you get under the blanket in the fire and the fire reflects off the blanket and it makes a big impact on the amount of heat it gives off and they think like for survival purposes, it's a good move to have. Where did I, where did I hear that? About a think I heard that on a podcast

Speaker 2:          02:50:48       trying to figure out which podcast it was. I'll try to remember. But the um, those little tiny blankets, they don't weigh anything either. So it's like a smart thing for people to carry around with, through the qbr. Warm supposedly never seen one warmer, but they're really good apparently for a, for reflecting heat. Like they can keep your body heat in,

Speaker 2:          02:51:12       you know, and, and pretty effective compared to their size and weight, just like we're legit when they wrap people around the chipotle burritos to go. I know they do. Looks like there's nothing to it, but maybe that's why chipotle, he uses those wraps. I got food. Poison that you pull it twice. You think you did in dc, how do you know? That's exactly where he got the food poisoning of the last thing I ate. right. And then how much time did it take between eating and you're getting food poisoning? One hour, one hour, but I felt like I felt like getting hot. Then I just threw up. And before that, um, one hour. What did you eat? Did you eat anything else earlier? Okay. It was, it was the plane eight hours before the food poisoning kicked in. I don't know, maybe three, three. The fly with hours.

Speaker 2:          02:52:05       I know that that's what I think most experts have never talked to. Food poisoning expert. I don't want to bullshit you because I think most people will say that it's more likely that it was the food that was on the plane that got you. Why didn't you get in a plane? Oh, he didn't, you know, latin fireproof, cloud. You're nuts. You might have gotten it from nuts. You sure it was food poisoning and not just like stomach flu. I don't know man, but it was bad for like three days. I lost 14 pounds, you know, whenever people say I got food poisoning from this, I always go. You might have, but I mean people don't know how long it takes to get food poisoning. It'S a little chicken. it was chicken. You think? How many, how many hours does it take before food wasn't chose that one to three.

Speaker 2:          02:52:45       One, two, three. Oh, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe one of the cerner had dirty hands. Maybe they used to think it was longer. Did they used to think it was longer? Because I used to hear that it was like eight hours. I thought you had to wait for it to digest, but you Can eat something. That makes sense. Then probably wester polar then. But I would say if you had eaten three hours earlier and then right after she went. Well, if they're saying one, two, three, one is one. Depends what it is, I suppose to roast chicken or clothing. That's scary. People get that from salad. Yeah. Yeah. Run off man's runoff from the animal areas. Animal shit essentially. Right? A lot of times when they have these, um, these farms, you'll get it rains and there's a lot of runoff and the runoff is carrying cow shit and pig shit and it's getting into the ground and it's getting onto plants and if they don't adequately wash these plants and you get them and you eat them raw, you can definitely get sick.

Speaker 2:          02:53:45       See what google that eco lie. What is the cause of eco lie in vegetables? I'm preTty sure that's the reason sometimes when you, when you want to drive to, like when I do show them by salary or bakersfield on the right hand side, you know, you pass by um, these cows. Yeah. And then there's a lake and I always thought that was water, but it was brought off a lake and lake. The whole lake full of culture just didn't do that. so dark. there's a lake, fill a pig, shit outside this one pig farm on of those factory farms that where they have these warehouses filled with pigs and they flew over with a drone to get footage of it. And you see This putrid disgusting body of water. That's just shit and piss and mean. It's massive. It's massive. I mean it's like a lake that you would think that you'd go fishing in the end.

Speaker 2:          02:54:39       Where are we going to put all that stuff? I don't know, man. It's going to go into the ground. They're not supposed to do that. You know this. this thing of figuring out how to make the most amount of money with having the least amount of concerns for the life of the animal is the total wrong way to look at it. It's just. But when you're feeding 20 million people and none of those people were aware of where their food comes, people start making based on money and profit and then you get to this point where someone allows them to where we don't agree on what should and shouldn't be done or we don't agree on what we should and shouldn't have force in force, and then we get to this place where you have these buildings that are filled with pigs and you've got a lake of piss and shit behind it and these things are jammed, these cages and they got a dead babies on the ground and you're like, okay, what's that?

Speaker 2:          02:55:23       That seems like hell like you've. You've created hell so that you can make bacon like that. That is a. That's crazy. That's a crazy way of contracting or getting your food, but bacon tastes so good. I know ecolab is a large group of bacteria with multiple strains, most of which are harmless and part of the normal flora of bacteria in the digestive tract. HarmfuL strains of ecolab produced something called shiga toxin, which can be deadly. The strain an under cooked ground beef, it's infected people through the consumption of undercooked ground beef some, so it's a, it's a toxin than exists in cattle. Okay. here it goes this time. However, the toxic strain of ecolab has been found on romaine lettuce, which likely became contaminated from nearby cattle manure. So yeah, that's what It is, is the recent outbreak and yeah, it's. I think it's happened before that I read about it as well with the other stuff. I think it was spinach. I think they had an issue with spinach in the past, which was getting hoever when the, when the news came out, joe the other lower watching smith perform and he had a spirit as job it was, but it was hilarious to us. He said, I'm spinach. It, um, there's a, the, the, the, the thing of spanish. And then he said it was a good time to beat up popeye.

Speaker 9:          02:56:45       That's a typical phrase. He's so silly. He's a funny dude either, buddy.

Speaker 2:          02:56:51       He's so silly. Very nice guy though, isn't he? Yeah, he's very nice guy. Funny dude though, that like that kind of joke. Like,

Speaker 9:          02:56:59       wow. No,

Speaker 2:          02:57:02       it's a good time to beat up popeye guys. Yeah. Um, but that's not from the vegetables themselves. That's the thing like that, those kinds of diseases or from their environmental toxins from the nearby stuff. So the letter was grown. It grew with equally in it on it, it caught on it somehow. The cattle manure. So even washing that letter is you couldn't not take it out. Well, thank you. Can I think you can. I think if you washed lettuce you can take it out, but if you cook it you much more likely to kill it. Like for broccoli and stuff like that, you're much more likely to be able to kill it. You know, kale stir fried kale. But the crazy thing is like had that happened in the first place, like was that a normal thing that would have happened on a regular farm?

Speaker 2:          02:57:47       Like if you just, if you just had a farm that wasn't a factory farm is just let the animals roam around just be themselves. Would that have happened? Is it still possible? Or is it only happened when you can contain a certain amount of animals? In a certain area, and then also try to grow vegetables in that same area too. I mean, I'm sure people got eco lie back in the day. I'm sure it's not a new thing that people get sick from guest. They didn't clean it well enough, but the way they're doing it, it's probably before refrigerators for sure. They probably got it right. Yeah, they must've got it like crazy. I bet people got food poisoning left and right before refrigerators. Oh yeah man. Oh, before always had diarrhea before. I know right before they was telling you, um, come to our restaurant, our shift washing his hands.

Speaker 2:          02:58:32       Do you ever catch your dog eating some in the backyard and you're like, oh, well for short it's going to be sick now. Meanwhile, nothing dead rat. They can find a dead rat. And you catch them chewing on a dead rat and you're like, what the fuck dude? I thought we were friends while you eating a dead rat. Man, that's so stupid. Getting the house. We've got nice next and sell the house, you know. And I'm thinking, man, he's going to be sick. He had a rat, nothing, zero problems. Ate steak. One time I left in my car overnight. didn't know us can be a great lunch. All these tips. It was so good eating it too, and I was sick for like three days. Oh, so bad. Bad lesson learned. Did you try to reheat in the microwave? Yeah, I put it in a skillet to a thing.

Speaker 2:          02:59:13       I was working at a restaurant. No, we made all the time. So you knew they probably had to cook it again and you thought it would be fine? Yeah, I thought it was. I thought it was in the clear. I in like seven day old kfc, but it was the refrigerator. I don't even cook it. Did that get you? It was good. No. No kid would see cold rocks. No. My favorite kfc is kfc. Cold with hot sauce. Like les hecka habanero sauce. That green ship matea doesn't have the kind of kick though a that need more. I need more. It doesn't have the cake. The spice, but not the real big kick. Like although like dave's hot sauce, maybe that's too much. There's a line, we're like, what are you doing? What are you doing? Fucking, you know, do you want to stunt like why are you eating that? You have doritos are good though. They're very good. But I mean there's like a habanero, so there's a level of hot. How about middle of the fucking hot though? How many arrows? How the fuck it's hot enough so I'm as fuck like that. You could tech. oh shit. There's a lot of good habanero sauces. lot. a lot of good ones. But the habanero sauce on cold chicken.

Speaker 10:         03:00:23       Woo.

Speaker 2:          03:00:25       god, that's good. Does your favorite terrible chicken? No chance? No. No. Uh, I don't. I mean I try not to eat it unless I have to from starving and that's all it's available. But most of the time I think, man, how are they getting these chickens? These are those tortured chickens. They live in those boxes. Yeah. These tickets. I have bigger breasts. But then you pass by chick fil a and you're like, what's the line about? What's the bonds of line? So big. must be delicious. Oh, I could taste a bond in the mayonnaise chicken. Sweet, sweet, juicy, warm chicken. I used to fuck with a little chicken. Littles from kfc, a little dollar sandwiches. The thing is, man, what you know what happened to get that chicken sandwich in your hand? If you get a video, if they give you a little fucking every every chicken sandwich you put chicken sandwich you, it comes to the documented life of, of the chicken, you know you could get a number like, oh, this, this number two, one six, and you go to the website and you can access the video of the chicken living from the tower to baby check.

Speaker 2:          03:01:31       So time it's grown up. Check and a dude will fucking gloved hand grabs this fucker. Stuffs them in a cage and feed them and it gets bigger and he's stuck in this cage and they'd take them out, whack his fucking head off, throw them into the furnace to blow off all his feathers, pull the guts out of them, cook them at kfc. If you could see all that, if you saw it from start to finish, you'd be like, what are the italian homeless doing here? They're going to tell you how much water was used to food to feed this guy. Well, we need more water. Yeah, for sure. But that doesn't disturb me as much as like the life of a pig that lives in a cage that's in a warehouse filled with cages. That's created a river of shit right next to a swimming.

Speaker 2:          03:02:16       I like wild animals, man. I liked the way they taste. I like the idea behind it was that most days like it tastes good. Tastes delicious. Burgers. At one time in beer, my uncle would cook. He would come and he will make it like carne asada, poor whatever. Sausages. And um, it was good. A lot of people saw a lot of americans go to Mexico to deer hunt the evidence. Another big deer hunting. Yeah. Um, what is there? There's another place where it starts with an s. So nora, so nora. So nora has a lot of big deer there. People go there to hunt deer. Scared as fuck. They're scared. Who going to Mexico? We're going to get me, get me while I'm over here. It's weird, man. They hunt deer over there. And turn them into tacos. Does it all wild ranging a free ranging a herd of buffalo in Mexico to really.

Speaker 2:          03:03:13       Yeah, the most. The shutter movie there one time and brought in buffalo. Then they left them there. I wonder because I've helped buffalo's buffalo's then. So catalina island or I don't know where. Catalina, right? Yeah. They asked. Well how to get there while they shot a movie. Was that he brought in her buffalo. They left them there. Oh, that's interesting. They used to be an island like one of those islands off the coast of California that had all kinds of wild animals that people brought all these animals over there to try to turn into a wild game park. They had like deer and elk and all kinds of shit. Roman runs one island and then the biologist said, yeah, enough of that, like, this is crazy. You've got to tie. ALl these things are breeding. there's no predators. Like this is eco disaster. Then human beings have created.

Speaker 3:          03:03:58       So the store that I had heard was that they decided to gun them all down. I want to find out fast, true jamie funnel. If that's true, channel islands,

Speaker 1:          03:04:06       is that what it was? Channel islands. It's one of those. I did a show at a military gigging and one of the islands. St nicholas island. Oh yeah. You were telling me about this. Yeah. Yeah. You told me about this awhile ago, right? Yeah, it was, uh, it was a, it was like a, they do they do the test nuclear weapons there in the ocean? Yeah. And um, it was just, it was just a quick gig at a bar and it was crazy because the show ended at 10 and against the bar closes at 11, but like five minutes before the bar close, 10 military police came in and make sure it's close. Wow. And then we left that one. they say we're leaving at five in the morning. They're leaving at five in the morning. There was no lagging. Like I was running late that they almost left without me. Oh shit. This was five in the morning. We're supposed to get off your face and head to your flight. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          03:04:59       Well, yeah, you can't fuck around their son. We did some. Ufc isn't military military basis. We did quite a few of them there, you know, did the one down in san diego we've done, um, in Texas, denim in North Carolina, I believe denim, a lot of different places, but they get super enthusiastic man fights on the basis and they would be on. I think they did it on spike tv. I think there Was on spike at the time, but a heavy shit man, it's interesting. Really interesting. Might've did it on fox two maybe on fs one, uh, one of those. Fox sports channels. Maybe fox sports one, but it's not like nothing else man. when especially with military guys fight. If one of the guys is Like a one time tim kennedy was fighting and he's fighting a hot towel who's a real world class fighter.

Speaker 3:          03:05:52       Real tough fight. And tim kennedy caught him with a left hook, just boom drops and with this left hook and then he's on top of the cage and they're cheering amendment. I mean the we had gone to the break to like, it wasn't doing this for the cameras who was doing this, like to express himself to these people that he just fought for their screaming and cheering for them and the corn nuts and he's pointing at them telling them I love you. I love you. Then I'm doing this for you guys. it's heavy shit, man.

Speaker 1:          03:06:17       A fellow soldier is that, that base and then they all cheer for him and he wins like that. It's intense. It's intense human beings. How appreciative of the people that are for you guys. Super, super, super happy with anybody. Not just so

Speaker 3:          03:06:33       do you see anybody but to have like a crazy event like a ufc on their base and they get to go and see it, you know? So a great treat for them. Break up the monotony.

Speaker 1:          03:06:43       That's good for the morale man. Fall camp. That's big man. You got to have morale and the vikings do that. Especially did mushrooms. People love like, I'm pretty like people who listen to your show man, you don't know like how happy you make them. You know what I run into people when they say, oh bro, for taking me on go and they always talk about, oh bro, like they will say, I wake up to you to you, and they talk about you, like they want to be here. They like everything you say, man. And, and I remember, um, when I was walking down the street the other day and I ran into a guy and he told me I'm a man, I'm, I was locked up in corcoran state prison for two years, for many years. And um, you are less coming. You are last comic standing helped me get through the hard times are whole.

Speaker 1:          03:07:37       You are whole. Um, our whole, our whole lot. A whole prison, allie. Oh guess what were they called it the whole block was rooting for you. You know, we were going to write it if you didn't win. Wow. And i'M thinking, wow man, fuck it. Inmates are watching me and they're voting for me. Wow. From, with the phones. And now remember that because one of your guests with George Perez, um, I, I used to write to him. I remember one time I went, I wrote them a seven, a seven page letter to stay up, you know, and he will call me in the middle of the night. George perez from prIson, like in the middle of like 11 at night. If repeat what you're doing, being free food. Enjoying my freedom back. Oh man. What's it like after everything is doing good man. He will tell me that he was doing comedy shows in prison for the guards for extra, extra lunch. Electric chips,

Speaker 2:          03:08:32       Georgia. Funny dude, man. The beast. It's a funny guys. Good joke writer too. Yeah man. Yeah, yeah man. I mean that's how joey started to, you know jody has started in prison making people laugh. They would like, they would have something going on. It would be born and they throw the cuban up there. It's really cute. Went up there and joe would go up there and make everybody laugh. That's how we got started. Then. That was a big part of like what katie gave him. The confidence when you, when you started at you, um, go at it or that you go read a book or like a minority we're going to do when you started tandem, how did you approach it? Uh, I just went to an open mic night and I got real lucky that, uh, was uh, available that you could sign up.

Speaker 2:          03:09:10       Was it boston stitches? August 27th, 1988. And um, you could just sign up and you could just go in there and put your name into the hat and you know, they got to pick x amount of people. I forget how many 20 people or Something like that and everybody does like five minutes. And uh, I just got Lucky and went up and just said, wow, I think I can do this. You know, I think I did. It waSn't good, but I was definitely thinking this could, this is a, this is something that you could get better at. You could figure it out and you could do it. But I remember thinking like, there's no way I'm going to ever be able to have a real job. I'm just too dysfunctional way to dysfunctional. I was way too crazy. Like I had a lot of drive, like the idea of being in an office and being trapped like that.

Speaker 2:          03:09:57       I felt like a like a caged in alley cat. Like there's no way man. I gotta get the fuck outta here. It was more out there. I just want to add, man. You know what I mean? It might not have even been an ambItion thing as much of an intolerance thing wasn't that I had this grand plan for myself like I thought I deserved better and I'm going to be the top of this fucking kick ass. It was that I couldn't do that. I can't do it because there's something about milk monotonous, boring shit. My brain is screaming for new experiences. Always does my number. Like it's a good thing, but it's also a bad thing because sometimes you just can't. You can't construct things because you want to think about other things that are better and more crazy and more exciting, more fun. So it's like trying to manage that mindset with a regular jobs almost impossible to me.

Speaker 2:          03:10:46       I just couldn't do it. I tried to, I didn't give a fuck. I wanted to quit done, can't do this. I felt like it was just a constant grind on your skin, just pulling your skin down and dragging you into this state where you didn't want to exist. You know, in some people are different. Some people have no problem. They find a great job, they're super happy. They make friends with the people they work with and every day is a pleasure and they just get in there and they laugh and joke around. But I'm too fucked up. I can't sit still. I have a million other things that I want to do while someone's talking to me about some boring shit. I've got like five other things I want to do. I'm like, I can't do this. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this. So I was like, stir crazy. If I had a regular job,

Speaker 1:          03:11:28       mia, I'm out of the rehab rehab picking 1992 of the drug rehab for crack without. Somebody asked me, um, what are your goals in life? Know what do you want to do? And no mommy did with a bunch of heroin addicts, guys from prisoners, you know, it was a rehab and then he told to write down five things. So I never had goals before. So I wrote down when to be a comedian. I want to go to Italy to love olive garden and I want to be sober

Speaker 1:          03:12:04       clove of garlic. Said I want to go to Mexico because I love taco bell. How? Yeah, that's the same shit. I know, right? I just want to do the whole one. We'll do the real tour of editing, legitimate plate. So I didn't know how to go about it, man. I just went to the public library. This was before social media and I winded with my badass gangster bald head and I told the old lady that is old white lady. Um, I sort of listen man. I don't know how to tell you this or how to explain it to your k. I want to be a comedian. I want to do standup comedy, but I wouldn't. I don't know. I don't know how to write. I don't know how to, how to put a job together. So that she put me to the shoot, she went to this big old big old library, a glossary card with, and then she followed comedy writing and then she got me this book called um, comedy writing step by step by gene perret.

Speaker 1:          03:12:58       Oh wow. Did you follow it? I did, I followed it. I learned that I will go back everyday to rent videos of lenny bruce and cassettes of george carlin for the library. And a friend of mine when I was a little boy, he had loaned me this vhs. And back then, um, if you fuck with a vhs tape, you could make it go six hours instead of a three hour movie. Oh yeah. You downgrade the quality. So I had like six comedy specials that I watched and they're all hb owes it with holly mandale, regus when you were in as little christmas sweater. Sam kinison, the young comedian show with five proud. And I'm jeff. Jeff, what, what? Yeah, ronnie with hosting and the dice melton. That tape. So I just got all that stuff and that's what inspired you. And I will go to a library and I just write down like ideas when they are, how old are you?

Speaker 1:          03:13:59       Twenty three, 24. And you're like, this is what I want. And I day I paid 12 bucks and I went into the main room to watch a real show and I saw him in sia. I saw some dude named the tod the time and I saw this old white black dude with a fedora white hat, tyree, tyree tyree. And I saw the guy that does the props. He used to inflate his body until the elvis. He's one of the blue color of comedy. He just props. He brings out people and I don't know, it looked horace. I saw luke torres who, who was on one of the blue collar comedians, does props. He used to a fleet himself, but he's not a, he didn't tour with them but within the show. Oh, okay. He used to like, like put it like get an iron and burned himself and they hit it off and then his face will be on an iron as far.

Speaker 1:          03:14:53       They don't do that anymore. And then he had like this bit where there's like a, he's like a football player and if people chasing them and like a fake football players behind. Wait a minute. Was this heat high? She's high, yes. Yes. Very funny guy. Fucking hilarious. It was a very funny guy. Remember when you have to have the church sermon? Yes to choir rather behind them and they would move around. He had like these people behind them. He had this whole contraption that he was a really funny dude. Yeah. So that was a. What year was that? While it was like 1994 probably.

Speaker 1:          03:16:05       where it will hit dodger stadium. And I used to work at a yoshinoya when hidell no, both plain. Oh wow. That was cooking food everyday. like just making japanese food. And every time I see a comedian I will ask him for advice. He knows I'm so young and I will talk to tk carter. Tk carter carter. He was in the thing punky brewster who the teachers. But do you remember tk carter was in the thing? He was in. He was in a bunch of big Time movie. Yeah, back then. But he was in john carpenter's the thing. They know another woman there that was part of the common use stores dry with curly hair. And she did a specialist power driggers from prison. She did it with them. Yeah. What did she do? She did stand up comedy. Uh, hit her at him. It was her poetry guests and Anthony Michael somethinG. Wow. I forgot her name. She's famous. She's famous

Speaker 2:          03:16:57       old school. Old school man. Yeah. Yeah. it's interesting. It's so much easier to get more inspired or to get inspired rather today because kids could just watch all that stuff that you just brought up on youtube. And youtube plus all the shit that's happening. Yeah. Rides, bus rides. And you can do it anytime you want. Anytime you're anywhere, you know, you put the headphones on. Bam. I sitting there watching a comedy special.

Speaker 1:          03:17:20       Cool. My first comedy album I listened to was bill cosby, my brother russell, whom I sleep with. Me and my friend jackie escalera. Um, he, he put it in the little fisher price record player and I memorized it and never up until then I never memorize anything. It's crazy. And then, um, which, uh, prior that niggas crazy. That was a fun fucking album ever. You could never get a tablet in the ghetto unless you call up and say five nigga clean white woman wears the body. Simple bro.

Speaker 2:          03:17:55       And joel quick, quick. That's not good. A broader racist jokes. They're so easy. They're so simple. But eric come up with it. Well, that one, I mean you gotta realize the world's a different place. When richard pryor was doing that man, the world was a different place. And to be first to. Well, he was not necessarily first I think is what it is, is there's like this progression and I think that, you know, uh, comedians get inspired by the other ones that are around them and they were really just starting it in the 19 fifties and sixties. Right. So then there's, lenny bruce was probably the first guy who does our style of comedy was just talking about things like, what the fuck is this? like, what is this? Ladies and gentlemen, why isn't this happening? Who caused this? What? Instead of just telling a bunch of jokes, he's talking about things and point things out that happened to be funny.

Speaker 2:          03:18:42       And then richard pryor comes on after him and makes it way funnier because what he did was like the same of thing, but way funnier. Like richard pryor had. There was another level of evolution that he achieved inspired off the work of the guys that were before him. The mort sols and the, you know, those guys inspired prior and prior of course inspires everybody. It all comeS from prior, like in the early. It's like lenny bruce is just this genius mind opening guy. That's dealing with people that are asleep. he's in a world of the 19 fifties and 19 sixties where people just asleep. They're weird. They're disconnected from the world around them from critical thinking. It's like they're just, they're just starting to wake up culturally and then boom. Richard pryor takes that and turns it into the funny shit that anybody had ever laid my all time favorite comedians always been richard pryor, george carlin, judith.

Speaker 2:          03:19:35       There's a lot of great ones, male and a lot of great ones, you know. Did you get a chance to see richard jenny at all? I did. A plaTypus. Met. Yeah, he was funny. He was funny. He doesn't get the credit. He deserved it. He was really funny, man. He had like a lot of both the vh one half hour specials and he was alive. He was on arsenio hall many times. Dude. He was on everything. Yeah, he's done a bunch of letterman's tonight. Shows tonight show a ton of times. He was a monster also. Um, I got to, whenever we go to dodger stadium, I saw one of my, one of my favorite comedians and I was working. I remember joel so fucking dirty. I was greasy bro. I had fucking pieces of chicken on my, on my apron. And I saw steven, right? Oh shit.

Speaker 2:          03:20:21       He was buying a hot dog and I said, and I was telling everybody, you guys don't know who that guy is. This kinda an oscar winner, homie. You don't know the full width bitch made. I'm super comfortable. And yeah, he got very uncomfortable. FUcking steven, right dog, right. Don't go nowhere. You're that guy. And I went around, I went around and he goes, you're going to pay for shit. Right? And he goes down because you're gonna walk out of here. He didn't want to shake my shake his hand and he put his hand inside of his hoodie. Oh no, he shook my head. Was the city or no, sorry. That's all right. Because he's, he like a germaphobe, germaphobe always. He really didn't even know he didn't want. He didn't. He shook my hand with content. It's hilarious, dude. That's hilarious. That must have freaked them out to ago.

My character was a supposedly trying, but I don't think they were never successful. It's hard to remember so long ago. You know, I was watching a clip of it the other day online. Somebody put something up online with me and phil hartman. I literally didn't even remember it. I was watching like, it was something that wasn't even me. I was like, this is weird.
