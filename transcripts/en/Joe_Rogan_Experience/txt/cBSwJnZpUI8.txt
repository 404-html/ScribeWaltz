Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Got Publicists with your, Huh? Yeah. She wanted. She didn't want me to do this without at least. Definitely don't do that on, on the air with live. People are going to get mad at you tonight on the air and you're hearing it right now. It's like, God dammit. John John's almost finished. You had all this time almost finished. You got to finish that fucking thing. That's an athlete. That's someone that works out a lot. Just like those imperatives, right? You got to get that food in there, which is key. It is key, but that's shit. What are you eating? What does that kind bar thing? It's all bullshit. Oh, it is. But is that a good one? Is that one ones with the five grams of sugar or one of them? Carmel. Fake candy bar type five grams of sugar. Definitely a little closer to that Jon Jones.

Speaker 1:          00:00:42       How you doing brother on the road? You know, I understand. I gotta get you some stuff to bring with you, man. Bring some good ones. He ever, uh, ever fuck with that guy. A primal kitchen. His, his stuff. He's got some great stuff. I'll give you some before you leave. I'll just try it. Yeah, you're doing the number one thing that people get mad at on this podcast when we just fight companion podcast is chewing. People get furious. There's something about being in someone's ear. Like my daughter was in my ear last night and she was chilling. She's trying to sit on my lap and she was chewing in my ear and I'm like, this should not be bothering me. Like why is this bothered me? I was having an internal dialog. I'm like, honey, you're eating in my ear and to her. She's like, what do you give a fuck? So I'm eating in your hair. I'm your baby asshole. You give a shit. How old is your kid that this one? That was on my lap. Six August. I have three. Oh Great. I got a 20. I got an eight and I got to six. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:01:37       Good for you. How many have you got? A four, eight, nine, eight, six and three girls. It's crazy, right? I'm going to say so bad. Jeremy Stevens says it's the fighters curse. I've heard that a bad ass is good old girl. My Coleman all girls. I think don fries got all girls. Yeah, I want to sun. So there's a surgery that you can do. Oh, I'm where? I guess they take my semen and they take out all the girl, the girl hormones. Whatever chromosomes injected into the white gives you like a 97 percent chance of getting a little boy. Really? Uh Huh. Is that legit if you googled it? I've heard a lot about it. I haven't limited, but if it's a possibility that they were going in that direction for the next one. Yeah. See, that's one of those things that I would google. I would make sure that it's not some horseshit created by some dude just to collect your sperm. I feel like. I think I heard Kanye did that to get a boy the second time. Oh yeah, come in. Income. Yeah. I don't know. I obviously got to look into it extensively before even trying to go in that direction, but that's the plan. Hopefully it's real when you think in some way. Now I'm not really too much of a spiritual one. I wouldn't say I'm spiritual, but I don't believe in. I don't. How do I phrase this? Would you worry that you would anger the gods? But trying to fuck with DNA. That's

Speaker 1:          00:02:59       so funny. That's a great question.

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       So I, I actually thought that, you know, because obviously I'm a religious guy. I thought that my theory has always been God is gonna give me a son when I am mature enough to raise a man, teacher man, how to be a man. So that was always my thing and I felt like, um, I felt like God was waiting for me to get married before a given me and my fiance, this boy that's deep and yeah, that, that was my whole theory. I was just like, when I'm mature enough and you were married, you know, God feels like we're in this good place. He's going to give us a boy and then I'm thinking, you know, but if we have another girl that trial and error, so expensive, that's 18 more years of raising some another girl, you know. So because me and my wife already had three, um, I call her my wife and my fiance. She's pretty much, my wife have been together forever. Um, so I'm like, I didn't want to risk. I don't want to read. You think about it in terms of a financial risk. Oh yeah, I can afford to have a thousand kids.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       Like what are you doing? But that's something that gets ingrained in your hat. And people always say, oh, the cost of raising kids, you start thinking about man, the cost, the reason it's more at the time. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:04:10       That time that you know, you to put it in, like, you know, you're raising another little girl and it's all trial and error. So I'm thinking let's just put a little science in there. And I'm like, I feel like God gives people the intelligence to come up with these ideas and these different, you know, surgeries or whatever to be able to. You got to be saying like, God gives someone the, the idea to be able to do this. So maybe he's okay with you. Choose a boy or girl.

Speaker 1:          00:04:38       Well, they didn't have the foresight when they were writing the Bible to take out genetic diversity testing or whatever the fuck they're doing. What, what? What would they be doing? Like some sort of DNA, chromosomal jazz. I don't know what they're doing. I don't know what the process is. Yeah, well people, I mean wouldn't you say personally that like people who are religious, almost all of them sort of pick and choose what they decide to agree with and not agree with you. You're a religious person, but you have a tattoo of you have a religious hatoon which is double ironic as it says in the Bible not to get tattoos. Right. Not to mess with the temple. Right. But then you gotta pick and choose what you were listening to. That's not the way it's supposed to go either, but you know where I'm perfect and he knows that.

Speaker 1:          00:05:26       Do you think when you were talking about like I'm wanting to wait until or that God would give you this opportunity when you are more mature, when you were mature enough to raise a man? Do you think about that? Like man, why do I have to wait? Like, why am I not mature enough right now? Like, if I can internalize that and if I can understand that, like what is the difference between me in the future when I am mature enough to have a man and me right now? Like, why, why have I not learned enough lessons? Why not having

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       a balance myself out enough?

Speaker 2:          00:05:59       I feel like I, I've, I've learned lessons every year, you know, every month, every day. I feel like I'm growing as a person, as a man, but I only, I know about some demons that I still struggle with and, and I feel as if when I'm over those, um, I'll feel outfit ready to be able to raise them and teach me how to be a proper bed. But you don't feel like you're over overdose yet. No. Middle of it, you're in the struggle. I'm definitely of still in the struggle of, of, of some things, you know. But, um, but I've definitely got over a lot of things that I, that I used to struggle with it, which I'm excited about. But, you know, life is, is a, it's a work in progress.

Speaker 3:          00:06:40       Well, you were telling me before the show that you, uh, you don't do instagram anymore, you're not doing anything, you just sort of laying low. You're not doing any interviews. So like before you were about to do this, you're like, oh shit, I haven't done anything like this in a while.

Speaker 2:          00:06:50       Yeah, yeah. The main reason why I decided to come on your show was um, I'm getting ready to do this grappling match against Dan Henderson on the 11th and um, there's gonna be a lot of media surrounding it and there was a lot of, you know, I got to do like a one hour phone or with a bunch of different media guys. And then there's a, a few reporters that's got to be there physically to, to do some interviews with me. And I felt like this is kind of just like a lot of things kind of untalked about and you know, people are just wondering how I'm feeling and what I'm, what I've been up to and stuff like that. And I didn't want to have to answer the same exact questions over and over 4,000 people, so I was just like, you know what, Joe Rogan has a lot of respect amongst the mma community and you know, his fellow goes obviously beyond the mma community. He's a smart guy and I was just like, you know, I'd rather let me just talk with you about kind of everything and get it out of the way. Um, but yeah, outside of this, this interview with you, I have not really done anything publicly since July when the UFC 200 scans.

Speaker 3:          00:07:48       So you've been on a crazy ride just not just through July, but for the last couple of years you've been been involved in a lot of crazy shit, you know, what are you, have you been, are you disappointed in yourself with a lot of this stuff that I am. I totally am. I totally am. Yeah. What does it feel like? Like, like, like, like Gimme the thought. Like we can go through all of them, but give me the thought like probably the most. I was disappointed in you and I love you as a person. I think you're a great guy to jail things. I really do. I've always had a good time hanging out with you, but I was very disappointed with you with that car accident. When you ran away from that car accident. That to me was like God Damn Johnson. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:08:25       place. Yeah, it was. It was. I was at a bad place. It was a. It was a messed up situation, man. I literally was an important mental life. Then when I was winning all these fights, I was the boy in the UFC. I'm sponsored by Nike and Gatorade and you know, the greatest of all time finishing legends after legend after legend. I'm just really in this position where I felt so untouchable and I just felt like I felt like everything was meant to go my way and in that time of my life started to. I was obviously, I was smoking pot, you know, majority of my career of drake drink and you know, every weekend pretty much, you know, to the point of blacking out. Just lacking out. Yeah. Just just being a hammer, you know, and just being a total party boy, but still, I'm still training my butt off, you know, I'm working really hard believer in really hired, have big goals, big dreams, but just being a party boy and I think I just took everything that I have for granted because everything for the majority of my career has gone my way.

Speaker 2:          00:09:33       And um, that, that morning I got in a car accident, man, I just, it was, it was just, it was, it was a huge reality check and it was, you know, I think in some people's mind they envisioned me, you know, hitting this car and running up and seeing that it was a pregnant lady and then it off Vernon. And then people said that I came back and grabbed a load of money, which is the stupidest thing ever. Why? With a millionaire and need to grab cash, right? Unless you run back to the car. So I literally, I went through a light, um, it was like a green light that said that I could turn left, but you're supposed to yield for the right of way, right to turn left. And um, um, person came through and I, I just assumed it was my green light to go, obviously being I'm not completely clear headed.

Speaker 2:          00:10:28       And I ended up running into a car. Um, I was definitely disoriented. I'm disoriented from the accident, from the accident for sure. Just kinda like what the hell just happened. It was a really big hit, but that was fine. I had no injuries and I just felt like, well maybe it wasn't that bad of a hit. So I literally, um, step out of the car and I realized like seconds later I realized my bulls in the car. So you bowl my ball, my. Yeah, my, my, my, yeah, my pop pop pot. Yeah. And I wasn't smoking weed in the car or anything, but it was in the car, but my bowl that had residue was in the car. So I literally, I open my car door, I'd like to take two steps away from the car and then I go back to the car and I searched the car because I had it in my cup holder and when I hit the ball fell somewhere.

Speaker 2:          00:11:23       Who knows where it flute you. But I knew, I knew shit. Like I can't find that bull that's gonna get me in trouble and just having a bowl of my car. So I looked for like two seconds and find the ball and I just took off running. Um, did you look at the other person in the other car? No, I had no clue that it was a woman. I had no clue that it was a pregnant woman. How much time are we talking about? Like from the time literally from the time that I hit, I had, I had, I had, I was over a fence probably eight seconds later. It was, it was literally a super reactionary, like just, I just felt I hadn't been home yet. I say that a friend's house. I wasn't drinking and driving. I, you know, my decision was to sleep at my friend's house because I knew I couldn't drive home.

Speaker 2:          00:12:07       He woke up early the next morning to go to work and he's like, John, feel free to stay here and uh, you know, you can make yourself breakfast or whatever, whatever. And the guy has a family, he has a wife and he has a newborn baby and I didn't want to stay at his house while he's at work. So I was just like, no, I think I'm okay. But really I had maybe like two hours of sleep and um, I didn't realize that I was still wasn't ready to drive. So, um, you know, I wake up and get in my car and uh, you know, I just wasn't ready to drive or whatnot. But um, why didn't you look at the other car because it all happened so fast. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. So it all happens so fast and um, I just knew I was a, I knew I smelled like alcohol and um, I just felt like if the police came out it would be a bad situation for me.

Speaker 2:          00:12:58       And um, I just thought the person that I hit had to have been okay because I was totally okay. I was like, maybe this collision wasn't that hard. Um, so I just feel like in a lot of people's minds they see me as like a, I knew it was this woman, I saw this woman hanging out the window crying and bleeding and sort of something like that. And like I just chose the lever and I didn't know what I had it. No, if I had a truck, I didn't know if I hit a uh, a punch bug, I didn't know what it was that I had. I just knew it was another vehicle you didn't even look. No, I didn't look. Wow. And I didn't go back for cash, but it doesn't make a, it doesn't make a what I did. Okay. The fact that, you know, I didn't go back for cash and I really went back for my boy, that's, that's no better.

Speaker 2:          00:13:44       Right. Um, full situation was just a shitty situation I was in. I was in a really bad point in my life. Taking everything for granted. If you wanted to have a situation come up with just like worst case scenario, that is the worst case scenario. Pregnant woman. Oh yeah. It makes me like a monster. It makes me look a monster. When you found out I was pregnant woman, what was, what was going through your mind? I thought, man, I am. I'm done. I'm done. First I was afraid that there will be some type of, uh, problems with their baby because, you know, obviously if she had a difficult pregnancy then that's, that's a whole different level of being in trouble and God forbid if she was having a miscarriage, um, you know, I would imagine that that would be $1,000 to put on me. So I thought about the fact that I went from just partying and join this career and this amazing fairytale life I went from.

Speaker 2:          00:14:40       I thought I was going from that to like literally being in jail, being labeled as a murderer. So that was my, that was my number one thing, was just hoping that the baby was okay. What about, what were you thinking about yourself? Like when you did that, when you read, I mean, there's no way you can be happy with yourself that you did that. What were you thinking? Well, I, uh, me and my mom have a great relationship. I'm a mama's boy. Um, um, and then I'm the father of four daughters. So, um, you know, if anything, my, my, my respect for, for women is I have tremendous respect for a woman and I tried to like, uh, obviously being a father, I like, I try to,

Speaker 2:          00:15:29       I just felt like a monster. I feel like a monster, you know what I mean? Um, I just felt terrible. I felt I felt really bad. I was just, I was mainly concerned with this woman's health and safety and I'm really glad that she ended up being okay. I felt really bad. I was just like, do even in the public's eyes, like you just heard a pregnant woman like doesn't really get worse than that but, but yeah, I had no clue. I had no clue that was even a woman that I hit and I felt terrible. And what was the, what was not just the, what was the reaction from your family and friends? Um, you know, surprisingly it was, it was okay. You know, um, they, they, they support me so much and they love me so much and they know that, you know, that I haven't really, uh, I believe I have a good heart. They know that I have a good heart. Um, and they were just were just thinking

Speaker 2:          00:16:26       man, like did anybody step in and say, hey man, you gotta get your shit together. Oh, I've had, I've had a lot of people telling me I need to get my shit together. And what was it about? Like what besides that, what do you mean? Like besides this one instance, what other things would people come to you and say, Hey John, you gotta get your shit together. Well, kind of all of it, all, everything that's happened over the last two years. What makes people feel like they can tell me that I need to get my shit together? And I recently, I recently went outside to my growers. My garbage man was coming up and I was late getting one of the garbage out to the side of the road, so he waited for me and I've even told me he was like, he was dumping garbage and he's like, hey man, like I'm waiting to see you fight again.

Speaker 2:          00:17:08       It's like you really need to get it together. Man. Just parked outside of my little kitchen pretty much just telling me to get my shit together. I've taken like, everybody feels like they have the right to tell me to get my shit together. I'm at the end of the day, you know, I sit there and I humbly take it because the right. Uh, yeah, they're right. But at the same time, you know, how many motherfuckers in the world, you know what I mean, like so many people are into all types of crazy shit and don't compare yourself to the losers and the losers. I know what you're talking to me, you know what I mean? Can say hey, well compared to dudes like to go out and who knows, who knows? I'm fine. Exactly. Knows what we're shit this guy's. And he's telling me to get my shit together. It's like just because mostly it's publicly don't mean you're any better than I am.

Speaker 3:          00:17:55       That's true. But you know that that conflict is never ending and you can't get involved in it. That that conflict that you're starting up in your own brain right now. It's a rationalization conflict. You start rationalizing your behavior versus well, a lot of other people do worse where a lot of that is a dead end, a bad road that a lot of people go down to make themselves feel better. The only thing that can make you feel better is to be pure or your shit together. Like if someone comes up to me and says, Hey man, you've been ripping off old ladies and stealing money from the church, I'd be like, fuck you. Talking to him about it doesn't make any sense. That's not true at all. So if someone says something to you, that's rude, that's not true. It doesn't have any impact on you.

Speaker 3:          00:18:33       But when someone says something to you, that's rude but true, then you have to rationalize and then you have to go, well, what about you man? What's going on in your life? Maybe you're into some dark shit. You know, that's a, that's a bad road. And it's a, it's a defensive road. And as a fighter it's a natural instinct. Somebody hits you, you hit him back so many attacks you, you won't. Yeah. But what about your weaknesses? And you want to try to search them out. And I'm sure a lot of people go through that when they read social media and they see these anonymous eggs on twitter saying mean shit to you. You Start Thinking, oh, I want to know who this fucking guy is and what's going on in his fucking. I'm like, that is a trap. That's a trap.

Speaker 2:          00:19:08       Well, you know, like I said, I do respectfully take it like I've never had someone say, hey, you know, get it together, John. And then I sit there and be like, oh, well, you know, I always, I always, you know, thank you so much for caring. Thank you so much for your route for me still and I and I really appreciate it and I'm working at it and, and I, I seriously have been working on my personal life tremendously and as of right now I feel, I feel amazing. I feel better now today than I did when I was a beating everybody's ass and you know, sponsored by the world and like I literally feel better today because I, I feel like I've conquered a lot of demons in my personal life.

Speaker 3:          00:19:48       May feel better, meaning you feel more at peace

Speaker 2:          00:19:51       more at peace, you know, like not worried about social media all the time like that, that has brought a lot of peace to me. Not worried about what people are saying, not even worrying about what's going on in the UFC. Like who has the builder or, or, you know, just just, just being Jonathan Jones and having my, my group of friends, um, across the country who gender like a genuinely loved me focusing on my kids every day. You know, taking my girls to cheerleading, practice, picking them up from school, dropping off at school. Basic stuff like me and me and my fiance, um, you know, living light, feel on top of stuff. Yeah. Being the top of stuff, you know, I'll go men no debts, you know, everything's caught up. Everything's, everything's spot on, you know, things I wanted to get fixed around the house, you know, that paint chip is paint it now. Everything's just, everything's going to. Everything is so put together right now. My life, um, outside of sports is. And uh, obviously haven't had the clear mind. Something that I haven't had in a long time, you know, I just feel I just feel really good right now. So um, as far as. And then, and then also being in a position where I don't even really need to fight against it either. Yeah. Financially

Speaker 3:          00:21:12       like don't you though? Don't you though in your mind?

Speaker 2:          00:21:15       Oh yeah. I have to fight because I have to fight because of the story. Can't end like this.

Speaker 3:          00:21:19       Yeah. Well it's like the financial thing is beautiful and everything like that. It's wonderful that you're set for life and you can just kick back and your children will be taken care of. And your wife would be taken care of. That's all beautiful. But you have a responsibility of greatness. There's very few people that ever get to the position that you, not just, we're in when you won the title, when you were the youngest ever ufc heavyweight or light heavyweight champion. Not just that, the youngest ever UFC champion. Now, not just that. There's also a responsibility that comes with potential. It's not, it's not just with what you've done and you know, it's what you could have done. Right? You, you fought Alexander Gustafson, be honest about that. How much did you train for that

Speaker 2:          00:22:04       fight? I trained, I trained for the fight, but, but I, um, I definitely, I had this thing where I just felt invincible and uh, did a lot of wild stuff leading up to the fight. I definitely didn't give it my all

Speaker 3:          00:22:18       as far as partying and sleeping right. Bailey party and stay up all night. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, when you win a fight like that where you weren't 100 percent, does that sort of almost reinforced this idea that you could do anything you want? And then, man, imagine if I trained next time, if it's someone big, I'll train.

Speaker 2:          00:22:38       Yeah. So I have this, I'm going to share something with, I'm not sure if I've ever shared this with anyone else before, but I had this crazy thing that I would do, um, where I would party one week before every fight and I did it throughout my whole career and uh, and it was stupid, but it was this mental crutch that I had. I literally would one week before every flight I would go out and I will get blacked out wasted. And my logic was if this guy were to beat me somehow I'm at, I can look myself in the mirror and say that, well, I lost because I got hammered the week before the fight. So it was a built in safety net. It was a safety net. Yeah, exactly. So I did it my whole career. I, I would go out and get hammered when we, before every fight. Have you ever worked with a sports psychologist? No, but now, but now I don't have my, my, um, my old st proof. I was the first fight that I did not do that.

Speaker 3:          00:23:40       Worse performance. So what was your worst performance? I think you were very unjustly criticized that fight because I think over in St. [inaudible] is a very tough guy. He's a very difficult five, is very strong. He's got a brutal left kick. He's athletic. He moves well. I believe it was a good performance, but it was still worst before. Let's see. I think over st proves a really tough guy and he was a tough fight. And you hadn't fought in a long time. You were off for how long? How many months? Sixteen months or something?

Speaker 2:          00:24:06       Yeah, it was, it was over a year. Yeah, it was a long time. Over a year ago. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:24:10       And then you're fighting a guy who had been pretty active and fought some good guys, had a great victory, was shogun and looked real good. And a lot of his fights and was an up and comer.

Speaker 2:          00:24:19       Main thing about events that really bothered me was, um, he was, he was the most, um, while he was seizing. Hey actually has been fighting longer than I have. A lot of people don't realize that, but he was just so green and raw still like skill wise, skill wise. Like I, I don't. Um, I studied everybody extensively and then I come up with their patterns. Um, I figured out the way they flinch. I figured out their first favorite punch, their second favorite punch, that third, their favorite combinations that set up. So they take downs when they clinched what side of the head is going to be a literally everything I know everything about every opponent, what side they're going to shoot, whether it's going to be a head inside his head outside. What am I going to do about that? You know, I figured out everything.

Speaker 2:          00:25:00       Why they shoot, where, what area of the cage they like to shoot everything. Um, and uh, with in St [inaudible] he, he, he, he doesn't know what he's gonna do. He's so that are unorthodox, you know, and he gets these random knockouts from weird angles and he's just wing stuff and he almost closes his eyes and next thing you know, he's knocked somebody out. You know, so the scary thing about him was a, he's so unpredictable and so, and I had a lot on the line. Um, so I just said, you know what, this guy is a, he's in a shell pretty much the whole fight. He was defensive, the whole fight and uh, and I just thought I had coached through the fight, um, and not really risk anything which I felt like I let myself down because I'm normally, I would just, I mean normally when you get someone like that you just, you know, take them out, you know, you should, I should have just been able to take them out. But I was content with winning and I think that was, I think that was one of the first fights where I actually just wanted to get the win, get my money, go back to what I, my actual goal, which was Thisi, um, instead of wanting to finish this guy like normal. So I had to really question my, I really questioned myself and why I'm like, I was like that while I was content with coasting.

Speaker 3:          00:26:16       Well, that was a fight where you, that had the most pressure on you and then in a fight you've had before as far as like people wanting to see how you respond to the adversity outside of the octagon.

Speaker 2:          00:26:26       Right, right. I agree. I agree. I had a lot of pressure and I feel like I responded great to my adversity. You know, I did all the things I had to do to get back, to get back to the stage, you know, I handled all my probation obligations and, and um, and I, I stayed healthy, started powerlifting and hired a nutritionist. I looked better than ever. I felt better than ever physically. Um, I did everything I had to do Amanda up and was responsible for my actions.

Speaker 3:          00:26:59       Yeah. Was it Greg Jackson that thought that the power lifting might have a bit of an effect on your performance? You thought that you were doing too much of that?

Speaker 2:          00:27:06       Yeah, well, I was doing too much of it. So, um, I literally, I started power lifting and I took off seven months of martial arts training. I didn't show up to Jackson's for seven months and I, I showed up to this place called Zia strength systems, um, powerlifting gym. I'm four days a week just getting jacked, getting jacked, African American. I became obsessed with lifting heavy weight and I literally didn't know martial arts training. And then about four months out from the fight I started to come into the room a little bit more. And then only three months before the fight, did I actually start a training camp?

Speaker 3:          00:27:49       No. Why? Why did you do that? As far as like cardio and things like that, wouldn't you think that your cardio would dramatically suffer from just lifting weights? I did a lot. I had a lot of weight to it

Speaker 2:          00:27:57       because I had gotten big and I, uh, I actually did a lot of, um, a lot of cardio training, but I was also, I had these new coaches, new strength and conditioning coaches who specialize in powerlifting. So I had to almost, we had to come up with a plan together of how we're going to start not weight lifting and doing all cardio. And even at the beginning stages it was like, okay, well let's just look lighter, weights more. And I'm saying, no, no, no, I need like cardio, cardio. And so it was just like a big learning thing that we had to do that.

Speaker 3:          00:28:26       Yeah. So these guys, were they, were they involved in martial arts at all these, uh, my power lifting coach, I know they were so, but, and they were giving you advice about martial arts training, sort of learning on the job?

Speaker 2:          00:28:36       Yeah, kind of literally the job, but they weren't giving me advice about martial arts training, they, they, um, it was just a learning curve. I don't think they had ever worked with an endurance athlete the way that I am. And so I'm mostly, they work with football players or power lift. They work with a Philadelphia Eagle and a lot of power lifters. Yeah. Um, but these guys, to their credit, they were really humble and they, they listened and they were able to quickly adjusted what we were doing every day to make it more about, um, endurance and not about maintaining muscle and strength and things like that. And I felt like I got in really good shape with these guys, so, and now we're at a place because I'm still working with these same guys and now we're at a place where, um, we realized the importance of endurance, that we're going to start way farther out and, and, and like I said, these guys are humble enough to do what I need them to do is put me through some strenuous workouts that I think are a great ideal racial differences in the right place.

Speaker 3:          00:29:28       So other than the fact that you did so much strength and conditioning or so much power lifting, what else? Like what did you feel when you got into the octagon when you fought over in St Jude, did you feel stronger? Did you feel like your endurance had been diminished slightly because of all this power lifting?

Speaker 2:          00:29:43       Well, I'm like, so, so like I was saying, I, uh, I took off seven months of martial arts and then I did a three month campaign. And so if you like anything, if you take off seven months, if anything, your game is going to change a little bit. So literally throughout my training camp I found myself trying to get learning how to fight again, pretty much I felt like timing, timing was off I creativity was off the things that, that go to moves that I used to do weren't quite there. Um, I would watch some of my old training practices or my old fights and I'm like, man, I'm not doing this stuff that I was doing before. Um, so I was really nervous going into. I knew that I was ready to beat dc because I was so well rehearsed and like the drills and everything were so Robert hearst to be DC.

Speaker 2:          00:30:32       But as far as going into the fight will open St Pruett. I just felt that my creativity was Kinda gone in my ability to improvise or wasn't quite there. And that was just from taking off so much time, uh, from martial arts. So in the fight with ogen St Prue, um, I felt really strong. I felt really, really strong, like picking him up against the cage and, and, and taking them down felt effortless. Um, as opposed to the way you used to feel, you felt stronger. I felt I felt really strong. Yeah, stronger. Um, what else? Um, endurance felt good. It felt good. It wasn't as sharp as normal, like a few times when when I took him down, I remember I wound up in a punch and I do a big punch and then I wound up and then I hit, hit him again in DC.

Speaker 2:          00:31:19       Said it was in the back of the head which wasn't. It was on the neck, but I was throwing big shots. I know Vince instead of throwing a whole bunch of shots and that was because I was feeling lactic acid in my arms. So I'm. So that kind of made me nervous that I didn't have the normal level of endurance that are normally have. Do you think that's because you had more muscle bulk? I think it was, yeah, I think it is because they have more, most of bulk but on the bright side and not that this is a good thing to, to injure someone, but I didn't break or fracture his arm with a kick and that's something that I've never done before. So that showed me. That definitely came. That has to be connected to just develop and so much power in my hips, into my legs. It's a point of like a balancing tipping point, right? Where it's like strength versus endurance and trying to find that perfect. Right. And right now, as, as, as I sit here today, um, I'm, uh, I'm using my past experience and you know, to measure what I'm doing as we speak. So right now I'm strong as hell. Um, but my insurance is actually in a really good place right now and I'm not fighting until July. So now we're figuring it out right now as we speak.

Speaker 3:          00:32:28       When you got really big, were you doing that? Were you thinking, Hey, you know, one day I'm going to fight heavyweight. Let's see what I would be like as a heavy.

Speaker 2:          00:32:35       Wait. No, no, I didn't. No, I didn't know what I was going to do at that point. Um, I just, I just needed something to be passionate about. Um, something that's to be competitive about while you were suspended. Suspended. Yeah. And uh, you know, I, I, I went through a real self destructive state right after the car accident and then how, so I just started to party more. I was, I was really, I was really depressed. Yeah. The belt had been stripped from me and I'm not until Anthony Johnson and Dcf, uh, um, that first time that I did, I joined the gym and get my, get my self together.

Speaker 1:          00:33:13       Why was that? Just watching that fight competing for your belt?

Speaker 2:          00:33:16       Yeah, just seeing them compete for the bill. That's myself, man. I am wasting and wasting talent. I'm wasting everything. Like, you know, I believe I can be both of these guys and they're up there and uh, on tv where I should be and I'm sitting here at home, I'm kind of, you know, living in this depression. And so I'm literally, the next day I called, uh, the, I walked down there stoned, right? And, and, uh, just like, Hey, I need to get my life together. I need something. I need something to be excited about, something to, to inspire and motivate me, get me up, get me out of the house. And, uh, and I just completely turned everything around from that day for it and just started to, to, uh, find a new passion and, and that was weight lifting and I, I got so strong so fast, um, and it became, it became everything to me just for my numbers to go up every week, um, and which they did. And I found myself really happy again, like, you know, squatting 500 pounds would be in 64 and the only way in, you know, to 25, you know, with these really skinny legs, 500 pounds is a lot of weight, like dead lifts and 600 pounds. You know, there were guys who had been training at that gym for years who still can't do those types of numbers. Um, and I was able to do it. So I was just like, man, you know, I can do anything I put my mind to.

Speaker 1:          00:34:47       And uh, I just thought I was going to become one of the strongest motherfuckers in Albuquerque. That was my, that was my plan. Well, power lifting gyms are very competitive and guys get super hung up on the idea of like lifting heavier and heavier weights. Hooked. I had a Mark Bell on the podcast before and we also did a podcast in Columbus with a Louie Simmons who's a world famous power lifting a guru and he's a fucking maniac and it's all with all those guys. It's all just about putting up big numbers. Keep it going, keep it going, keep it going. Heavier numbers, you know? Yeah, it was, yeah. I fell in love with it. It's crazy sort of discipline. It is. Yeah. So it's so simple to use, just lifted up, but it's very satisfying for people looking at it like, who gives a fuck if you squat 500 pounds, but when you're doing like screaming. Exactly. Everybody, high fives, chalks flying in the air. It's the best.

Speaker 2:          00:35:42       I'll tell you. I love it. I, I, I really love power lifting and all about getting injured though because that's a big part of power lifting until I have a pretty good traders and, and um, and they teach me the right way to do things, but they also allow me to, um, be out of position a lot of times too because, um, a lot of times people focus on the perfect form at everything, but when you looked at real big wait, you're not always going to be in the perfect form. So they, they almost allow me to be out of position. Sometimes you are not in the form is still power through positions. That way you're, you're strong grappling sense. Yeah. You're strong in Everett, you're showing every, every, every part of the movement, whether you're a former bad form, you're still able to lift big weight. Well, that's the big theory behind functional strength, right? That's why people like doing things like that

Speaker 1:          00:36:27       power cleans and presses because it's such an awkward thing to do with the weight and you're, you're in weird movements and you're doing things with your whole body right now. What are you doing

Speaker 2:          00:36:39       days? So these days I am a, I have just been doing, um, uh, are you back on Jackson's a bunch of power lifts and a bunch of wrestling and Jujitsu? That's been my thing lately. No striking. Uh, no. I haven't done any striking. My whole goal is to not get punched in the head at all. That's your goal. Well, that's what my plan is. I'm going to eventually answer my workout routine to where I'm doing a lot of myths and working on my versatility. I'm working on my versatility and, and just my abilities on my show. You, you're not throwing any punches these days. Not throwing out kick now, but it's crazy to me, but my plan is to get into that. That's not going to last for too long, but I won't be doing too much sparring. Especially heavy spine. Right. But even without doing any sparring, you don't hit the bag you don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:37:29       Lately I've been doing a whole bunch of wrestling and Jujitsu. Wow. And I'm really starting to love it to just Jujitsu will. Yeah. I'm, I'm really starting to love Jujitsu and Jujitsu has been the art that I've neglected the most over my entire career and surprisingly I have the most submissions in light heavyweight history. Um, I think can Sha Kim shamrock is right behind me with maybe five and I have six. Ken shamrock are frank, one of them, one of the shamrock brothers are behind me for most submissions in. Well, Ken was never a light heavyweight, right?

Speaker 1:          00:38:01       I mean Ken went to light heavyweight when he fought Tito, but in the early days, like when he was, he was a heavyweight. I'm sure someone could figure, figured out is a light heavyweight and the Tito days. But that was ken, you know, later on in his career. How many submissions did frank have?

Speaker 2:          00:38:16       Maybe it's frank, I dunno. Keto Frank. I think one of the shamrock brothers are right behind me and some interesting legends. Legends of the sport. Yeah, pioneers, man. But now I love Jujitsu, man. And will you bill for it? That's for sure. These long arms, man. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm becoming a joke man. I'm shocked. I would assume that

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       someone who is a professional mixed martial arts fighter has to at least maintain a maintenance level of striking.

Speaker 2:          00:38:42       Alright. Constantly. And my plan is to get back and I still July still very far away

Speaker 3:          00:38:47       now when it's July. How does that work when you're suspended? Because, uh, this is a question that I've always wanted to know, like if you're suspended for ped or something along those lines, are you not supposed to train with other fighters that are in the UFC or is that bullshit?

Speaker 2:          00:39:01       I, I, I haven't heard anything about, about. Because that sounds crazy, right? That's the train.

Speaker 3:          00:39:07       Especially if you're trying to help friends. Right. It would be very therapeutic for someone who's on the outside

Speaker 2:          00:39:11       and that's. I spent a lot of time helping other fighters. Does that help you a lot when you're trying to get back into things and to sort of just someone in my house studying their opponents?

Speaker 3:          00:39:20       Yeah, that's a, that was one of the best parts about MMA and martial arts in general I think is helping friends

Speaker 2:          00:39:26       given back something. That's to me too, because martial arts can be a very selfish sport, you know, it's a, it's a team sport, but um, if you're not putting yourself first, then you're not going to make it to certain levels. I've been really selfish my entire career and um, that's one thing my coaches have always gotten on me about, Hey John, I know you live in New York. I know you got a family, but you need to get back down here to help these guys. They have a fight coming up. But now that I live in Albuquerque, I'm constantly giving back and helping other fighters, especially since I have all these suspensions happen. Do you surround yourself with too many people that liked to party? I used to. You used to. I used to for sure. Yeah. I used to have a lot of wild friends. And when did you stop hanging out with these people?

Speaker 2:          00:40:11       With the car accident? Um, or like, no, after the car accident when I, when I decided that it was going to be completely sober, I uh, I let loose a lot of friends and it was crazy because, um, I used to, my phone used to blow up on Friday nights because everybody knew that John was going to be buying everything that people need to know. Like I literally, I'm that guy who went to the bar and um, I would just buy like 40 shots patrol, right? And I'm just like. And literally if you're standing around me, you're getting a shout out patrolling, just passing them out. Right? And next thing you know, people who don't even know each other, they're all hugging and I'm really good at merging people together and have strangers and having a great time. And that was my thing, like walk into a bar where I know five people and now I have 20 new homies and like everybody's just hanging out.

Speaker 2:          00:41:04       Um, and so when you're like that, you know, Friday nights come around, 8:00, everybody's like, yeah, where are you going to be tonight? You know, that's, you know, if I'm out there's going to be more people around, you're going to have a way better time. Your chances of getting laid is going up because you're hanging out with me. It's just the truth. I just had a bunch of people around me and um, and um, since I became sober, a lot of those phone calls, they slowly, they slowly, they slowly stopped, you know, and so now I'm a, I've been sober for almost 16 months and um, and now I'm, I have had the best times of the best times. I, I remember everything that happens. Um, my friends don't try to ever encourage me to drink or anything and, and uh, so they know I'm not going to.

Speaker 2:          00:41:56       And um, I just had the best times, had the best times. I'm. And how were you able to make that transition? Did you follow many program stop being no idea and I just stopped and I stopped answering my phone call for a lot of people. Um, and I, um, I just kinda went into hiding for a while. I just, um, I just stayed away from the scene until I felt like I was strong enough to just not do it. And um, and, and it, it helped, it helped a lot. And now do you ever go to bars now and order a water or anything like that? Yeah, do that. Yeah, I go out, I go, I'm and uh, I'll drink red bull, red bull, whatever. I'm in a situation where a lot of people are drinking. Sometimes I feel like I'm just kind of chilling and like a little bit too chilled out. So like in order to like keep up with a bunch of drunk people that are talking to drink red bull, drink a red bull.

Speaker 2:          00:42:54       Too many of those though, man, it's terrible for you, but I mean it's way better than just getting turned up. So it's funny because I, I've developed this, uh, this way of just having so much fun, completely sober where a lot of times when I'm leaving like a place, someone be like, hey, how are you getting home? I'm like driving. So it's great. I really do appreciate my sobriety. I love it. I know you were having, you were saying you were having a problem with pot. Yeah, I did. I, I've, I've been, uh, I've been a stoner since high school. Yeah. Um, is that like stopping that, was that as easy as stopping drinking or is it a, was more difficult? It was, um,

Speaker 4:          00:43:38       s

Speaker 2:          00:43:41       it was, I think stopping pot was really tough because I literally didn't associate with too many people who didn't smoke that that's the way I kind of like a lot of people in my own team. I didn't hang out with them because I was, I was kind of one of the hardest working guys on the team, but a little bit of a bad boy and none of my teammates were really a bad board. Meaning you smoke pot. I'm just being an. I was just always down for a good time, you know what I mean? So I just kind of, a lot of my friends were people who weren't martial arts, had anything to do with martial arts and I would always kind of associate with, um, just just party people, people who would like to have fun. Um, so I realized once I quit smoking that I really didn't know too many people who didn't smoke, so I had to kind of start hanging out with people who didn't smoke, which I kind of found, I thought it was boring. You

Speaker 3:          00:44:35       don't like to stare up at space, they don't want to go to the mountains and meditate well fucking cross legged position

Speaker 2:          00:44:42       people who are just straight, you know, we're always just straight and um, and I had just, I had to find different activities to, you know, because when you're hanging out with people who don't party, you know, they have certain ways that they have fun and it's usually based around a lot more activities I feel like. So I got into mountain bike, mountain biking and um, you know, jogging more fitness, just laying on fitness and things like that. So now, you know, fitness is like my drug. I really love being strong and being healthy and like I do mountain biking and Jujitsu. I do a lot of Jujitsu these days and, and so that's Kinda like, that's what I live for outside of family. And of course,

Speaker 3:          00:45:25       well, it sounds to me that you've done an audit of your life and you've looked at all the issues that you're, you're, you're dealing with, and you decided to not engage in them anymore. Have you write things down? Do you write goals down or, or things that you demand of yourself? Do you ever do that? I do. I have a, I have a

Speaker 2:          00:45:43       list on my phone of different ways of thinking that, that I want to stand for

Speaker 3:          00:45:48       different things. You think you're thankful for, you know, different ways of thinking, different ways of thinking.

Speaker 2:          00:45:53       Yeah. That, uh, that I want to stay for you. I do like, like how so? Um, just little things that helped me be patient and, and to be loving into appreciate. Um, there's just, I've had to look through my phone, that kind of, I just, I just write down a lot of reminders of what I stand for, you know, and, and how I, how I view things and yeah. But I do write things down. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:46:26       Now when you look at the future and you see yourself from here on out, do you feel like from now on, for, from my time on this earth, no more drinking, no more pot, no more partying.

Speaker 2:          00:46:38       Um, I do believe that I'll drink really advise as um, just because I coming out of high school I started drinking in high school and I always felt like I needed alcohol to be cool or to um, put myself in certain situations to, to conquer anxiety or whatever. Um, to be a part of the crowd and to have fun and relax. Yeah. I always thought I needed alcohol and um, so I got to a point where I couldn't just go out and have a drink. I would always get to the point where everyone's getting crazy and things are getting wild, you know? And, and um, I never really had the opportunity to develop a healthy relationship with it. It just, it just went from high school to college when you get even more to being famous and being able afford to buy everybody drinks every night.

Speaker 2:          00:47:32       Right. So I, I just, my relationship with alcohol it, it became unhealthy and I never went through a period of time where I, where I had a healthy, mature, responsible relationship with it. Now being sober for so long, I know that I can have one drink and feel a little bit of a buzz and catch an uber home or whatnot or I know that I can go out and not have a drink at all and be the life of the party. I know that I can go out and not have a drink at all and approach someone and talk to someone with zero anxiety or feeling like, oh, I, you know, I could sit amongst the group of drunk people and know that I'm cool in my own skin just the way that I am. And that's something I never really had the opportunity to experience until now. And so, um, now I feel like I'm in a mature enough place where, um, if I wanted to have a drink in the future to celebrate a victory or something like that or a glass of wine at home with my fiance, I know that I could do that now. Um, so I just, my relationship with it and it's completely changed and I, I believe that I could drink in the future and not run into some of the wild, you know, crashing a Bentley into a pole. Stuff like that that I was doing before.

Speaker 1:          00:48:43       When you say you believe you could, you know, it's interesting. I'm kind of talking out of my ass here because I've never had a problem with alcohol. But I know people that have. And the people that have had a problem with alcohol, they, the way they describe it, they're like, I can't do it. Like if I go back, I will go all the way that there's a, there's a thing that alcohol does to you where it says, or drugs, you know, like just a little bit, man, just a little bit. Come on. We're just going to get a little bit, just a little bit, just a little shot. Just a little. Just a little beer. What's a beer? Everybody has a beer. Come on man. And then that's the siren song. That leads you back to the rocks. I feel like, um, I had a problem with alcohol but I never wanted to admit it.

Speaker 1:          00:49:25       Like when you say you had a problem, did you have a physical problem? Like when you got it off the alcohol, did you have withdrawals? Did you feel weird? You know, I feel weird. I wasn't waking up and drinking every day. So it's a psychological thing. It's good. Yeah, I was, I was getting hammered on the weekends. Right, right. Um, it wasn't waking up in and like I didn't need alcohol, but I always said to myself, I don't have a problem with alcohol. But then when you run into a pregnant woman, you have a panel of alcohol. The day that something affects you, the first Gwi you know, it's a problem. You weren't thinking straight. Something was caused you to not think straight and it was your actions and what you chose to take into your body, and then you said, all right, I'm done with that, but you feel like you could get back to that. I feel. I feel like I'm. I feel like alcohol. I

Speaker 2:          00:50:13       was never really like. I was never really addicted to alcohol, was addicted to 'em. I just really enjoyed partying a lot and I made a lot of bad decisions with alcohol, so now I, I really have had the time to see clearly where I went run with alcohol. Obviously again, being a public figure, I live in a small town. I never needed to be getting blacked out in public again anyways. It's just something that I look back and I hear stories. My boys were like, Yo, you remember the time you do this? I'm like, oh no. I used to get blacked out in public. It looks a little bit in this small town that I live in. It's just like. So I, I just, I've had a lot of times they evaluate marijuana actually is something that I don't think I want to go back to really to, I don't think I want to go back to and I don't feel like you have an unhealthy relationship or had an unhealthy relationship with marijuana.

Speaker 2:          00:51:03       I, I re, I have, I was smoking way too much pot. I was poking way too much pie. Literally breakfast, lunch and dinner in between workouts to study film to do everything. I was just, I was just in it for me. There's some functional smokers who can wake up and they have eight things they're going to do that day and they do all eight things like me. I would wake up and I had eight things I needed to do that day and I'd be like, ah, I got three of them done today. Like I'm good with that. Like I just, I, it just, it slowed me down, slow me down and now that I haven't been spoken to, I just feel a lot better. I feel a lot better. I feel um, I feel more on my game. I feel sharper sparking up a joint right now. Go ahead and saying. I know it's probably hard for you to hear it. I know this fairly well. No, I mean honestly everybody differently. Absolutely does. It absolutely does. That's important.

Speaker 3:          00:51:53       Sodas, red bull and so does alcohol and so does everything else.

Speaker 2:          00:51:55       Yeah. You know, it was, it was all day every day for me.

Speaker 3:          00:51:58       But do you think that you, um, was it all day every day because you were looking for an escape or was it all day every day because it had formed a habit and you just, that's what you were used to doing.

Speaker 2:          00:52:07       It became a, it just became a way of life. It became a way of life for me.

Speaker 3:          00:52:10       When you're dealing with the amount of stress and just the amount of pressure is probably a better word of being, you know, one of the great fighters of all time. I mean, you're without a doubt one of the best fighters that's ever fought in mma and there's so many eyes on you and there's so much pressure and there's so much money involved and accolades and all these different things. These, these, you know, hey John, we've got a business meeting for you. Hey John, this company wants to talk to you about doing this and hey John, and there's just so much coming your way. Do you feel like it's almost like you had set yourself up in a position where you needed like some escape. You needed an escape valve and that's what you had found through the drinking that's you had found through the pot. You'd found these ways where you could not be Jon Jones for awhile. We could be the blacked out dude at a bar. All of a sudden you feel normal. You know, normal as normal as you can feel by being a 20 whatever year old millionaire fucking throwing shots around and albuquerque the, you would found a valve to release you from some of the intense pressure of being one of the baddest motherfuckers on the planet.

Speaker 2:          00:53:23       Yeah, yeah. I, I agree with you. Yeah, absolutely. It definitely made you feel, uh, for those moments, your hands away from you. She just blocking the microphone and I, um, yeah, I, I do agree that it is for those moments made me kind of feel

Speaker 4:          00:53:47       um,

Speaker 2:          00:53:50       normal like normal. Yeah, for sure. Especially the bar thing, especially the bar thing, like going out and just having a good time. Like sometimes I, I forgot that I was a celebrity and that there was a lot of eyes on me and, but for those moments I felt like I was like, I think I was one of my biggest problems. I felt as if I was amongst. I didn't really hold myself to a higher standard because of who I was and what I did. I, I've, I've, and even to this day, I just feel like I'm one of the guys like where you are. Yeah. In one of the guys like, I, I don't try, I don't really seek hanging out with other celebrities. All my friends are like, I'm just normal average joe guys. And, and, uh, back when I used to party, I used to feel like that was me just not being John Bones Jones and just being one of the guys, like just doing the wild shit that everybody does it. And then when something bad happens, it's like you're quickly reminded that millions of people around the world know exactly who you are. So it's just, it's like,

Speaker 3:          00:54:49       but isn't it, it's a two edge sword too because the people that get completely lost in the idea that they are this unique and special person, you eliminate yourself from all those other folks and you, you separate yourself and that's extremely hard to relate and there's a lot of celebrities that go into a shell and everywhere they go they have security that takes him places and they'd get delusional. They have a, they have a completely distorted perception of how people interact with them because they don't just go hang with people.

Speaker 2:          00:55:15       Right? Yeah, that's, that's definitely not me. I, I, um, I meet a lot of people and people say, man, you just don't act like you don't have famous. I'm just like, I don't know. Like I like, I really have a lot of pride and just doing what, like just normal shit, like going to places that most people, even fighters in Albuquerque, you don't don't go just being amongst the people and, and I, I think a big part of me long to just kind of just be not famous sometimes.

Speaker 3:          00:55:41       Now my question, the reason why I asked you that as, how do you plan on handling that now? Because if you're not going to be drinking and you're not going to be smoking pot and you're, you're, you're going to mean right now you're living life has just Jon Jones, the person and happy with your family and happy with your life and just working out and having a good time doing Jujitsu and all that stuff, but eventually everything's going to ramp back up again. Media obligations going to ramp back up again. All these things are gonna happen and the pressure is going to be back on you again. What are you going to use as an escape valve then?

Speaker 4:          00:56:15       Hm.

Speaker 2:          00:56:17       Have you considered that? No, I haven't really. No. That's very important. I feel like, uh, I feel like I've matured in a way where, um, I don't think it will affect me the way it used to. I've really had the opportunity to step away from it all. I realized what I had and who I am, what I was. And um, and um, I just feel above what used to be. Yeah, I feel above the way. I used to like let so much consuming. Like even right now, like, I don't know, it says just so hard to explain it. I just, I don't feel like I'm in the same. I don't feel like I look at things the same.

Speaker 3:          00:56:57       Well, I'm sure you don't. I mean that's the thing about growth and that's one of the things that when people are haters, what they try to do is lock you down to the old you, right? They try to lock you down to you at your very words. Yeah, man. I remember that Shit in 2010. You said that fucked up thing when you were blacked out. That's you, Bro. Remember that I was blacked out. What did I say? You tell me, you know when someone can, someone can believe that they are their past, but we're not know you're. You have not had fuck ups. Then you don't understand the consequences. Yeah. I mean you've had considerable amount of fuck ups and a lot more than the average person in a public sense. There's a lot of people that have done a lot of fucked up things, but no one knows about it and the repercussions they feel it's not the same as yours. You feel the repercussions of millions of, first of all, millions of people that loved you, that were disappointed. Millions of people that were jealous of you that like I fucking told you was going to throw it all away. There's a lot of that to get people psyched that you fucked up far, far from

Speaker 2:          00:57:56       though in our way. Sometimes I'll get people to write me and say, do say things like, oh, you ruined a great career. Or like you a. like people have this mindset that it's all over.

Speaker 3:          00:58:06       Yeah. I saw a lot of people saying that. People that I, I, I like said that and it's like, I was like, you're crazy. You're an idiot. You're crazy. He hasn't thrown it.

Speaker 2:          00:58:14       I haven't thrown it away right now. There's a pause going on, but as far as it being all over or whatever it is just so far.

Speaker 3:          00:58:21       True. Do you, do you fall boxing a little bit? A little bit? You know, Bernard Hopkins Story? No. Bernard Hopkins, one of the greatest boxer of all time for sure. And he'll, he'll fight December 17th for his last fight at 51 years old because he's a goddamn defensive wizard. He's still does commentary for Hbo, still sharp as a tack, but Bernard Hopkins went to jail and uh, he decided when he went to jail, when he was young man, he decided that from that point on he was going to be disciplined and there there's no more bullshit and his life, no more robbery or assault or any of the shit that got him into the position. Whereas in and then he was going to dedicate his life to being a world champion boxer. And from that point on, he became one of the most disciplined boxers ever. Never ate bad food, never drank, never did anything stupid, always was in shape.

Speaker 3:          00:59:11       And we'll go down in history as one of the all time greats, guaranteed shoeing hall of Famer. And I feel like Bernard Hopkins was created by the darkest moment of him being and him doing time in jail. And when he came out of that jail, one of the first things that I'm. One of the corrections officers said to him was, you'll be back. And he, he used that as fuel. And he knew that like, there's no fucking way I'm going to look at that dude again. There's no way. There's no way he's right. There's no way. And ultimately Bernard Hopkins escaped his demons by facing them, by being in hell. But being in hell, I think he was in jail for, I forget how many years, but just enough, just enough to cement and his eyes to hardened him to the fact that what he needed was discipline and control over his own destiny.

Speaker 3:          01:00:00       And I think that for a guy like you, you can take all those dark moments that you've experienced over the fuck man. You think about it, man, you got away pretty light. That girl could have died. You know, a horrible things could have happened while you were drunk driving when you slammed into that, that Bentley into the truth. Although all these terrible things could have gone wrong that you kind of got away with. He kind of mean you. Boy, I mean, if you wanted to think that someone's looking out for you, you've got all the evidence in the world that points to someone actually looking out for you. That's great for sure. Something out there, whether it's luck or whether it's intention or whether it's God or whatever the fuck it is, man. What the bottom line is right now at this moment, you are still in your athletic prime. You're still only six months away from a sport. When is your suspension? About eight months, eight months away from our suspension being released. And I mean that's. This is all a great thing. How old are you now? You're 30, 29, 29 be when? When's your birthday? July notice. So you'd be 30 when you come back, you know, 20 nights though would prime. That's you. That's you at your best. You really, your prime is like 32.

Speaker 2:          01:01:05       That's why I like, um, I put the, I put the Jordan, the Jordan crying face as my twitter picture. Have you seen that?

Speaker 3:          01:01:18       I put that up with you with the belt on the Jordan phase. The reason why

Speaker 2:          01:01:26       that up is because a, is because, um, I know that right now I'm in a position to do some magnificent and extraordinary things. I, uh, I know that because I've made so many mistakes, I make the perfect role model. I make the perfect person to, to, um, to still be able to inspire millions of people. There's very few people who are, who are perfect and flawless and just that clean cut, never did anything wrong. Athlete a, there's way more people who are like me who has struggled with drugs or just being an idiot or just doing wild shit way more people who have lived their parents don't let their families down. Let their friends don't let themselves down. Um, and because, because I've made so many mistakes on it, on such a public, you know, such a big scale and so public, um, I feel like all the great things that I'll do from here on out, we're going to be that much greater because of where it came from to, to do it. I feel like I'm, I feel like my best is yet to come and there's just, I feel like I'm in a position to, to really touch a lot of people and inspire a lot of people because of where I came from. So I'm really excited. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:02:43       is that something you concentrate on more than you constantly mean? Do you concentrate on that as much as you concentrate on just doing it for yourself?

Speaker 2:          01:02:51       Um, do you want it for doing it for other people? Um, motivates me probably more than doing it for myself.

Speaker 3:          01:02:58       Why? Why is that? Is that from all of the accolades that you've received from all the fans realize that you have all this love out there from all these people? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:03:06       I just feel like I don't need it. I don't need it anymore. I feel like I, um, I feel like I've done everything already. I've been in all the wildest situations already. I've had all the craziest experiences, stayed at the nicest hotels. I've seen the world of eight at the nicest rest. Like there's nothing else that I really need out of this, uh, out of this thing. I've literally been there and done that already. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:03:32       um, I feel like I'm, I just feel like ultimately I've already gotten so much out of this sport and what I need to do is to truly get something. What I really need is to know that I'm changing lives. Like that motivates me more than, than anything else right now. I'm the story, the legacy. And um, so the reason why I put that laugh in meme up is because I'm laughing at my pain and my struggle is right now I'm laughing at what I'm going through right now because I know my future is just so incredibly bright and I know the impact that I have.

Speaker 2:          01:04:11       I know I know what I can do and what I'm going to do it. Like right now I'm just, I'm in a waiting period where I have to wait before I can show the world what I'm actually capable of, what I can be and what I'm going to do for someone else one day. Um, and it's also laughing at like people who actually think that I'm out down and out, like people who actually think that my story is over or you know, it was just like, I'm just laughing at it all because what I have done is like, I've seen some athletes come back from way worse stuff, rape charges and murder and attempted murder and, you know, all this type of crazy shit. You don't have anything. I've done. I have a party too much and I've done a lot of stupid stuff like from being a party boy. And I know I'm not a bad person. I'm not like this evil athlete, you know. Does it bother you when people think you are because people. No, no, I didn't. I don't because you want to ask people, you know, there's like, no, I don't. There's people who wants to believe that I'm this terrible. Uh, you know, one of the worst things that has ever happened in sports, you know, people want to believe that because they just don't want me to be all that I can be and

Speaker 1:          01:05:26       people look at the worst case scenario and they look at the worst possibility, you know, they look at you as this guy has had so much success, so many things handed to them that maybe he thinks he's better than everybody else now has been handling. Of course, of course. Yeah. But they don't, they don't think about it that way. I know, I know that, but they don't think about it that way when they see the worst case scenario. I mean, the way it was played out a pregnant woman in a car. And you in your practice when you took off. Yeah, I mean it is like for the haters, it's like a dream come true. Yeah, it is.

Speaker 4:          01:05:57       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:05:57       But I can, man, I. One thing I've learned about myself is that I can't be held down. I don't, I'm not held down very easily unless you,

Speaker 2:          01:06:06       I just can't be held down. Man. I deal with adversity very well, man. I always find a way to get my shit together and, and dig myself out of a situations and like, and ultimately rise above. That's beautiful. As long as you don't count on it, right? Oh well now where I'm sick of getting in my own way and like, like UFC 200. Let's talk about that. I literally what happened. I did everything that I could to be back in a position to win that belt bed. I was getting ready to just show this triumphant amazing story of someone who just made it through a hit and run situation. It had almost had everything taken from them and got it all back. And then, um, and then, um, I'm sorry, I'm thinking about so many things at once. We're happy with.

Speaker 1:          01:06:57       So let's just talk about what happened. You, you tested positive for some estrogen inhibitors or blockers yesterday. Didn't blockers that a lot of people associate with people who take steroids. People take steroids, they want to restart their system, or if you want a testosterone boost, you take clomid or clomiphene and these are, these are standard drugs in the steroid users world.

Speaker 2:          01:07:22       Yeah. This is all new for me. Yeah. Um, basically what did you take? So I took a, I took an offbrand Cialis bill off brand. It was, it wasn't actually alice, but it was described to me as being a cialis and so I thought it was a Cialis and I, I just took it. So why is it guy like you need. Seattle's have a huge got jail. It's too big. It's too big. It's a good answer. We don't have the resources to get it normally a new yet, you know, I, I'm your partner. No, it wasn't even necessarily party and know I've taken like melon has, but before, and for people who haven't taken it, you literally, you know, you go from being like that to just. It puts the twist at the end of the punch list at the end. You know what I mean? Is it like it? It's, it's a good time, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:08:20       it's a good time to be a quote. It's a good time. Now. What was this like? One of them's gas station. Rhino pills, one of those things. No, I haven't.

Speaker 2:          01:08:30       Edit teammate basically tells me, hey, uh, he was talking about how his girlfriends are pharmacists and, and he, he's capable of getting all this stuff and, and all that type of stuff. And I was like, well I do, I don't do drugs or anything like that. And he's like, you ever take a Cialis? And I was like, yeah. He's like, I got to Cialis. And I was like,

Speaker 1:          01:08:48       well, you said you don't do drugs or anything like that, but you would done drugs. Well, yeah. Yeah. But no, he was talking about all these painkillers and all this different shit than other things on top that he has because his girlfriend's a pharmacist and he wasn't, she getting this off brand stuff from him. It's like, I don't know, people get a lot of stuff from China. I mean that's what happened with Anderson. Anderson got liquid cialis from China and it was tainted. Look, this happens. I know for a fact that everyone knows for a fact that happens. The supplement industry has a giant issue with the people that mix the stuff, like if you have a VAT and you're mixing up whatever, creatine or something like that and right before, I mean, if this is done in some country or some place that doesn't have excellent standards, it's not scrupulous. You could have been scooping up steroids in the batch before that and you just throw the creatine in it and some of it gets contaminated and they don't clean it. Yeah. That's pretty much a lock. I'll get to that. But okay. So you take this off brand seattle guys like

Speaker 2:          01:09:45       you ever do by Agros and all that stuff. And I'm like, yeah, I've, you know, I've had melanie pain pills before and he's like, oh, I got cialis. And I'm like, oh this is great. So I ended up taking one of the cialis bills and um, um, and I thought everything was fine and dandy. I had no clue. Um, what Ha, you know, that I was now having something else. To me that was illegal. I took a sales spiel on June the 14th of June, 16th. Um, you cited, came over to my house 6:00 in the morning. Hey, what's up guys? That coffee going offer when everybody water bottles. Super Nice, hospitable. Come in. I'm laughing and joking with them. I had no clue that that test was going to be the test that derail my life. And um, you know, right before UFC 200, uh, my manager mark, he calls me over to his hotel room and he said, okay, I want to talk to you man, like, what's going on?

Speaker 2:          01:10:40       He's like, Hey, you're not going to be fighting. What are you talking about? He's like, you know, you didn't feel you didn't pass your drug test and a, the level of hurt and just and confusion. And I literally had an anxiety attack and I had never had one of those before. What does that feel like? I felt like the whole room just came in on me, like the whole room came down on me and I was just, I couldn't breathe. I remember opening up his hotel window looking for a balcony. So I could just breathe and realize that I'm like not trapped. Um, there's was literally the window opened that much. I was like, what the fuck, so you don't drop out my hotel in Vegas where it was in Vegas, fucking brick and I'm breathing. They don't want gamblers leaping through the banking. I'm breathing through the thing, calm myself down.

Speaker 2:          01:11:29       And um, and I instantly started thinking about the weight of the. I had the weight of the world literally on my back. I knew that I knew that I wasn't going to be fighting a few hours before everyone else knew, the public knew and I was just, I could already start hearing everything. Even my own coaches, we looking at me like just their hearts were on the floor. Like I had done so much to get back to fighting at UFC 200. Like getting my life in order, getting the people around me in order to get in my head, my health, my mind, you know, just being in order to beat DC. And, and like literally right now I've done so much. So much of the right things to be back in a good position and right now you know, people look at me as if I still don't have my shit together, but the only thing that I did was I took a pill that I thought was gonna get me a boner and it literally, it's caused me a lot of heartache and a lot of disappointment and a lot of them threw me back here in any way, shape or form.

Speaker 2:          01:12:31       When someone gives you this pill and you don't know where it came from, you don't know. What did you think, man? I don't know what's in this. No, I didn't. No, I didn't think of it because I'm, I had been dealing with the athletic commission. I've been in the UFC for a long time and I've taken a little gas station Dick Pills before, like, you know, like, and I've never failed a drug test ever. Did you? Did you ever think that you might have got lucky? No, I didn't think I got lucky. I thought that you fail drug tests when you're doing sketchy shit. Right? But didn't you think there might be some sketchy shit and some Chinese? No. Station Rhino, Dick Pill? I, I, um, what you know about the rhinos. My friend Ryan, my friend Brian called it, he was on the podcast. He said, you know, John Likes to party.

Speaker 2:          01:13:12       I bet he took one of them Dick Pills. No. Um, that's funny you called it. Yeah. Well he was, he was on. Oh, I haven't. I've taken them several times before. And with the Nevada State Athletic Commission, I always pass my drug test and, and I know that I would never do anything to cheat this sport. I've a lot of pride in my work ethic and knowing that do dot, I've been skinny my whole career. Whooping people's ass. I'm not a knockout artist. I wouldn't because I'm smart and you know, I work hard. Um, but with you with the Nevada Athletic Commission, I never had an issue. And then I was suspended when you started came, so I was never really educated on how serious you shot a really was like, I um, I came back into the game and there's like, oh, hey, we got this new company name and Usada instead of Nevada. What were you suspended for when you to cane? Oh, you

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       mean when they come into the sport? I understand what you, not when they come into your house. So when you started came into the sport. I was suspended because of my head. Right. And so I never had even met anyone who worked for you side. I'd never been sat down. I know you sat a seminar what to do and what not to do and how serious it is and what could happen if you do this. And all. The thing I knew is I had to report where I was at.

Speaker 2:          01:14:31       Like if I go to La for the weekend, I got a little sad to know that I'm in La because they test me at anytime. That's the only thing I really knew about Usada. I didn't know that. Doing something that I had done several times before, it could ultimately lose me a fight, so I'm. The only difference was I had taken like little gas station pills and I've taken by Agora before this was, this teammate gave me something that was Seattle is I thought the only thing that it would do is make me bigger and stronger for longer. That's all I thought was going to be happening and then when I find out that

Speaker 1:          01:15:05       that I just felt that drug test. Do you know that via Viagra is actually illegal in the Olympics? I didn't know that. You can't take that stuff. The Viagra is a performance enhancer though. It's a vassal. Dilate or I believe. I believe that's how they describe it and it actually has athletic performance enhancing product properties to it. How does it, how does it help you? I don't know. You'd have to look into that, but I think it's similar to in a lot of ways to nitric oxide supplement, like a, like a pre workout and get your. Yeah, yeah. It does something to open up your blood cells and get you pumped. I mean, it does something not just to your Dick but to all of your muscle. Yeah. I don't know if I would want it to be pumped up during a fight. I don't think it works that way. I mean, I don't think it actually can possibly potentially help endurance. Well, yeah, I know, but I know that athletes take it for that reason. That's why it's banned from the Olympics.

Speaker 2:          01:15:56       Yeah. But, um, but yeah, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:16:01       I understand that it wasn't your intention. It was not my intention. I had no, I had no clue that I needed to report this to the side of because I thought, you know, literally I was report and everything else. What supplements, what preworkout, what, you know, my amino acids, protein powder, like you saw it, had all my stuff. And what happens once you find out? Did you, how'd you narrow it down to this pill?

Speaker 2:          01:16:22       I literally, I went through my supplements and I, um, handed it to. I hired a private lab in a lawyer and we started handing it, given them everything that I took, which isn't really a lot of stuff at all, you know, stuff that everyone should take fish oil, basic basic supplements, protein, protein powder, fish oil, you know, liver cleanse that like, or whatever. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:16:48       just grapeseed extract that kind of stuff, very multivitamins for men. Basic, very basic stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:16:55       And, um, and then, and then get nutrition is like, you know, we sweep, scanned all of our stuff. We know it's not from

Speaker 1:          01:17:03       that. Got Nutrition website, those fucking hilarious to the Gat nutrition website at the moment. We found out about that said John sponsored

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       by Gat Nutrition. So we've, oh, let's check that out. Get nutrition to some fucking dude is just, they have a lot of great, great products. If you want to get bigger and stronger than you can definitely go to them, you know. But as soon as we saw that, we were like, what in the holy fuck is he taking? Oh No, I mean, but people saw you. You got gigantic. Huge. That radically, completely, uh, completely natural. And that's what I have great pride in being the natural athlete. But, um, but, uh, so they got, they got all the cat stuff, test it and clear, right. Everything was clear. Um, this gets to have other things that you don't regulate. Absolutely. But the things that they gave me, they were super smart about and uh, out in all the products I was clear and um, and uh, so my managers, I think outside of the box did you take anything that could have possibly been?

Speaker 2:          01:18:04       And I was like, I don't think so. Then I was like, well, one of my teammates did give me this, this dick pill. And he's like, I need those. So we got those pills tested and sure enough, they, uh, in their ingredients, they listed about five products in their ingredients and they actually a, there's actually seven products too that weren't listed in the ingredients. The two estrogen blockers were never in their ingredients. Um, so, um, it was a tainted pill. It was. Say what I'm saying? Yes. So, um, so the you cited was able to tell, okay, this was totally inattention and there's no way. No way in Hell I'm John would take these estrogen blockers on purpose. First of all, it was very small traces, so it wasn't like I was loaded up with estrogen blockers and um, why the fuck would they put estrogen blockers and a pill?

Speaker 2:          01:19:03       We believe that the factory that created these, uh, these dick pills were maybe manufacturing these pills in a dirty laboratory, whatever. And they were just tainted. Yes, because each pill that we, that we had tested, some of them had more estrogen blockers, some had almost no estrogen blockers, some head small traces. Actually none of the pills were consistent. So it was obvious that it. And we, we tested several different packages. So it was obviously that, that these pills were probably getting made in the same machine and there was just traces a little, which is enough to show up in your system when you get at some of these dick pills that had none. No estrogen blockers and be like, damn, why didn't I get that one? Yeah, exactly. So I, I took one that was just contaminated enough and literally I got tested two days later and it was in my system, so it was, it was obvious that it was complete accident and even, and even if I would have reported the Deq pill to Usada, they would have read the label and the label would have never said that it was estrogen blocker in there and I still would have had a dirty.

Speaker 2:          01:20:07       Right.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       That attainment contaminated. Where does that leave you? How much time did they suspend you for? I got suspended for a year back from starting from back in July. So now I fight in July of two subs. I love you. I love what they're doing. I don't agree with things like that. I don't agree with things like that. Because what you took does not enhance your performance? No, it doesn't. Especially in such a trace amount. I feel like in certain circumstances, like there's been several fighters like Chad Mendez, he has a, I believe he has eczema and he was taking an Eczema cream that had some sort of a. was it a hormone precursor or a hormone? Peptide, I believe, some sort of a hormone, peptide. I think that enhances the use of this cream. I don't. I don't know the full. I'm obviously not a doctor or a scientist, but there's something about suspending someone for something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:21:04       That seems ridiculous. Well, in my situation they, they the, the evening you said his lawyer, he. So he showed a little bit of remorse. I could. I could feel that he felt bad about what was happening to me because I think he could really, even the arbitrators, they could tell what had actually happened, but their problem was they said John was just negligent. Like you didn't. You should have reported this pill, but that doesn't. It seems to me that's silly. I mean that's even if I would have reported the pill, they would've read the ingredients and they would've never saw that there was a trace of, of something that wasn't advertised. So why? Why suspend someone for something like that? Because they. Because they have a zero tolerance policy. It was just like I was the first fighter to ever take them to operation and and they were more upset that I didn't let them know that I took the pill.

Speaker 1:          01:21:55       Then what actually happened? The rule, as you tell us what you take and we can point you in a different direction, but I never told him what I took. My whole argument. Was it if I told you what I took, it still was never on the label. Yeah, so unless you guys were going to spend all the money to take it to a private law or take it to a laboratory to test this individually, you get what I'm saying? I still ran into the same situation. I think it's great to protect people from people that are cheating. I don't think it's great to punish someone for taking something that has a trace amount of something that does the absolutely no benefit whatsoever and clearly it wasn't supposed to be in that pill and wasn't supposed to be in that pill and clearly wasn't being taken to enhance athletic performance.

Speaker 1:          01:22:37       Right. That seems silly. It seems like a mess. It seems like a mask that, I mean, I, I understand their zero tolerance policy. I don't agree with it. And this is more of the Chad Mendez situation, you know, there's, there's weird ones like Yoel Romero. He tested positive for something. They found out that it was a, in one of the protein powders or something. He was taken. It wasn't supposed to be in there, wasn't listed that way and they gave him an abbreviated sentence. He should have. No, no, no punishment whatsoever. But I mean, my whole thing, Joe, is I'm so grateful.

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       I'm still optimistic, man. I'm, and I'm always looking for light in every situation. Um, and I think that's the way I deal with things. I just, I'm always trying. I always believe there's going to be good at the end of the day, that's just how I am. I'm just so grateful where most people would be so upset with themselves and all this type of stuff. I'm really not. I'm upset about the fans that are let down who flew out to UFC 200 and things like that. But as far as the whole situation, I'm just glad that that my, my name will no longer be associated with steroids, but I'd rather be vulnerable or whatever you want to call me, you know, whatever you want to call me. But steroids that, that was, that would have really. That was really bothering me. So I'm just glad that it's out. What actually happened? Why did they choose to suspend you for so long? Just because of the negligence behind it. They didn't like the fact that I, that I was handed a sex pill and I never returned. I never turned it into a them to check it out.

Speaker 3:          01:24:01       And if they did, they still would've kicked you off at UFC too.

Speaker 2:          01:24:04       Yeah, exactly. So

Speaker 3:          01:24:05       I don't know. That would have given you a more, maybe a more abbreviated suspension, but still it's,

Speaker 2:          01:24:11       it just seems ridiculous. I wonder when we hand pills into Usada or hand anything into these Saturday, did they read the label and say, Oh yeah, you can take this or do they actually take it somewhere and test it? I'm sure they read the label. I mean if they still would have been in

Speaker 3:          01:24:23       position, yeah, they are, they're not going to test things. I mean that's, that's expensive. And if it doesn't say it's on there, there's no reason. I mean if somebody gives you whey protein powder, well hey, let's test this and make sure that it doesn't have clomid in it or say

Speaker 2:          01:24:35       it would take weeks to get it back and it cost thousands of dollars and if you're doing that for every UFC fighter. So yeah, that's my whole thing. I'm like, even about, I told you guys I took it, you guys would have read the label and it gave me the okay, right. Because we were allowed to have what's an vagrancy? Alice and us, we're actually allowed to but because mine's was tainted and I didn't ask, they were just like, well you never asked so we're going to suspend you. So I don't really know why they decided to go ahead with the full maximum punishment. But I tend not to question things that I'm. So I'm really young and, and you know, I believe that my best years of my prime is even still ahead of me, so I'm not even tripping about it. I'm like, you know, whatever, like, you know, I believe in God, so I try to always point things back towards God.

Speaker 2:          01:25:19       I'm just saying, well, you know, maybe this is God's plan for me. Maybe I need this time away from the sport just to continue working on my own personal development and growth as a man and, and I, I do believe I'm in a good place right now. So I'm excited to see where I will be back in July when it's time for me to actually compete with Glen. In July you released? Uh, I think around July when was used 200 July, eighth July fifth GFC, 200 was December 10th or 11th? December 11th. I'm sorry, that was a ufc 205 UFC 200 was July ninth. Okay. So July seventh I'll be eligible to fight two days before UFC 200 July. Seventh, 2017. I'll be able to compete and I'd like to fight right in July.

Speaker 3:          01:26:05       Yeah, there's a big UFC July fourth car that we put on every year, but you're going to miss that.

Speaker 4:          01:26:09       MMM. MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:26:12       What do you think now when you look at the UFC title? Picture cormier just had to pull out. He injured himself and a rumble. Johnson decided not to fight Luke saucy. He decided to step back and wait for cormier. You know,

Speaker 2:          01:26:24       I don't believe. I think that's a smart idea. Um, Musashi is capable. He's a very smart fighter of being rumble. Johnson and I'm.

Speaker 3:          01:26:35       It's a high risk, low, low return, low return. Why? Why do you need to be Sassy? Yeah, yeah, yeah. The title fight picture is sort of waiting. A lot of it is waiting on you. That's a big part of it. Waiting on you to return. Yeah. I'm excited to go back and get my baby. I have they had conversations with you about when you do return, what kind of fight you would have. Would you go right to a title fight? Fight a contender?

Speaker 2:          01:26:59       No, it is. No one's spoken to me about whether I get an immediate shot or a, whether they make me a fight at least once or twice before or no, I have no clue what they're actually planning on doing. But

Speaker 3:          01:27:11       how often do you communicate with UFC?

Speaker 2:          01:27:13       I, I literally haven't spoken to Dana White, uh, since uh, like a week before ufc 200

Speaker 3:          01:27:19       now that the UFC has been sold.

Speaker 2:          01:27:22       Well actually not a week before a fight week of UFC 200 years anyways.

Speaker 3:          01:27:26       Now the UC has been sold and there's these new owners. What's your thoughts on all this?

Speaker 2:          01:27:30       I'm excited to, uh, to get to know the new owners of the UCL. I don't, I've had a few interactions with ra before. Um, but um, obviously I've never dealt with them on a business level, but I'm excited. I do Miss Lorenzo Fertitta. I think I had a great relationship with him. He was always the calm, cool, collected one, the one that I could actually, you know, like leave emotion behind it and like really have a good conversation with. So, you know, we had a great relationship in that way. Um, but I'm, I'm, I'm excited about the new leadership.

Speaker 3:          01:28:04       Yeah, it's interesting, right? It's a new chapter in it is a lot of who knows that that's what gets exciting and they're, they're obviously very entertainment business savvy and see where it, where it leads to. When you look at the state of mixed martial arts today, what problems do you see in mma?

Speaker 4:          01:28:27       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:28:29       Do you see anything that stands out glaringly? Like, here's, here's some things that I think about weight cutting weight, cuttings of giant issue. When you see all this work that's being put in by Usada to make sure that people aren't taking things to the point where someone like you who's taking something that's not a performance enhancer, get suspended for a year. And the idea is that you're supposed to be protecting fighters from someone who's doing something that's dangerous, right? That's the tape behind it. The cheating and somehow could cause potential danger or damage to people. But what about cutting man, isn't it? I mean, it isn't extreme weight cutting. One of the most dangerous things.

Speaker 2:          01:29:05       Um, so we're going to put this on pause. I have to pee.

Speaker 1:          01:29:08       Oh, okay, go ahead. Go ahead. I was drinking this water and coffee. Good. Talk about weight cutting. John's going to be right back. Go right to that door. Take the eggs on light and don't let your publicist talk you to coming back in here. She's probably listening.

Speaker 3:          01:29:23       Interesting. Very forthcoming with the boner pill talk. I think that's important. I mean if anyone's going to believe him, that's the only way to really get it out there. I fucking hate weight cutting. I do. I had a conversation with Ari Emanuel about it and I'm going to have a conversation soon with Novitsky about it and I just think is the most. It's the most unnecessary and dangerous aspect and fighting the most important aspect in fighting his fighters, being healthy and in shape and competing to the best of our abilities and if there's anything that inhibits that other than not training, it's the dehydration effect of Wake County. I think weight cutting is. It's terrible and now that they can't use ivs, I'm obviously again, hate to say this again. I'm not a doctor so I don't know what. What is the most effective method of rehydrating? But I've talked to doctors and I guess they vary in their opinions because some people say it's orally is the best way through drinking water slowly, but some people say it's not. Some doctors say no. Ivy is a far superior method, especially when it comes to rehydrating the brain, which could take as much as 72 hours. Um, I think it's interesting that in boxing most of the deaths have come from the lighter weight divisions and they attribute that also to weight cutting and did

Speaker 2:          01:30:45       duration. Okay. So you have a bag that I'm talking way too much.

Speaker 1:          01:30:49       Ah, I knew it. I knew it. She's like you said too much about the Dick Pills, mom on the dick pills longer, faster, harder Jones. Really? How much we

Speaker 2:          01:31:02       do you cut? Um, I don't really cut a lot of weight at all. I, um, I, I get myself down to about

Speaker 2:          01:31:12       2:20 on fight week. And then what do you weigh right now? Write down to 30 2:30 to 2:30. But I get myself down to about 2:20 during fight week. And then I make sure that the day of winds I cut about five pounds of water. That's nothing. No, it was nothing. But that's a testament to just, you know, I've been doing it for so long now I know my job is to be, you know, to have my weight together. When you see conor mcgregor weigh in at 1:45 and it looks like, like death, right? You know that when I see those, that that's what scares the shit out of me when I see people that are just clearly cutting way too much weight or

Speaker 3:          01:31:54       when I ever saw was travis Luder when he fought Anderson Silva, Travis Luder, he like his lips were dried up and cracked and he was shuffling to the scale. Like he couldn't walk. He didn't have the strength to pick his feet up and walk. He was like, just shuffling towards the end. He still didn't make the way. It's shitty but scares me the most because a, there's not a lot of options when it comes to weight classes. If someone's one 85 and they go, you know, man, I'm having a hard time fighting one 85. Then they look at you and they're like, fuck that. This is two. Oh five. That's a 20 pound jump. Twenty pounds is a big jump.

Speaker 2:          01:32:27       It's huge. Yeah. Yeah. As far as will it come for me, I just, you know, it's never really been an issue for me. I've always made way. I've never come close to missing way. Um, I just think, aren't you

Speaker 3:          01:32:38       lucky though that you are in the neighborhood of two? Oh five. Like what have you. We're just a little bigger and you know, you're in the heavyweight.

Speaker 2:          01:32:46       If I was a little bigger than I will let, I would go to heavyweight. Um, but you know, a part of, of our, of our job is to keep our weight under control. You know, if you know, you're gonna be fine at two. Oh five. You have no business walking around it, you know, a to 50. You know what I mean? So, you know, he's just, you know, there's enough weight classes. No, I, I would like there to be at least another weight class when it comes to us. Big Boys, you know what I mean? I would love it if they went to 25 to 25. Yeah, I believe that there was a to 25 pound weight class, I'd be, I'd be a two belt holder myself. You feel like that would be a better weight class for you? Uh, I, I love to a five. I make 25 just fine, but to 25 I compete against 2:25 pounder any day, you know, face the guy who's shown up fight night at 2:40 or whatever and you know, as bargains heavyweights pretty much every, you know, I've been doing it my whole career anyway. So, um, it'd be great to see, uh, some, something that bridges that gap a little bit from 12. Five to two 65.

Speaker 3:          01:33:47       Yeah, I would like to see it. I would like to see between 55 and 70 slash 70 and 85. Just 15 pounds a giant leap. Twenty pounds from 85 to 205. And then of course two. Oh, five to heavyweight, that's a huge leap. That's 65 years

Speaker 2:          01:34:00       pound check antic yeah. A lot of people are like, why don't you go up to heavyweight and try to win the belt there. I'm just like, you realize what you're asking me to do. These, these guys are very skilled. He's got a very skilled and, and they, they can waive it for 60 pounds more than me. That's very dangerous. But, but have you thought about doing heavy weight? I do want to challenge, uh, for the heavyweight title. Um, but I'm waiting for the perfect opponent.

Speaker 3:          01:34:25       And when you do do that, when you challenge for the heavyweight title, are you going to gain weight? Are you going to fight it the way you were at?

Speaker 2:          01:34:32       I'll fight right around two, 2:30. So you will not lose any weight at all. I would try to eat a lot and make sure my endurance and speed and agility is where it needs to be. And uh, I've beaten up a lot of heavyweights. Man, you know, the only people who are at Jackson's have seen that. I've submitted a lot of heavyweights. I've slammed a lot of heavyweights of manhandled a lot of heavyweights, but um, but, um, and I've done it right at the weight I am now, so I know that, that I, that I'm capable, I just wanted to make sure that I compete against the, the right stylistic matchup for me when I do go to heavyweight and challenge for that title. One of the things you said earlier that I thought was really intense.

Speaker 3:          01:35:11       Nice. You said you're not going to spar hard again.

Speaker 2:          01:35:14       Yeah. No, not until it was time. I feel like I've been majorly preserving myself, so I'm leading up to the oven st proof. I, I, I took almost as if no concussions whatsoever. And then I've been a suspended now for another year and I've taken no concussions. So, um, while I feel like a lot of these guys are in this race to, to get better, I'm getting a lot better. I'm getting a lot stronger. My wrestling and Jujitsu was getting a lot sharper. Um, but I've, I've completely, my brain is feeling great right now. I haven't been polluting it with shit and I haven't damaged it. And so I just feel like, uh, you got the best fighter in light heavyweight history, who's still the youngest guy in the division who hasn't taken any damage whatsoever and it's completely regenerating himself and I'm going to come back and have this explosive, explosive second half of my career.

Speaker 3:          01:36:09       No, there's a lot of guys that are doing that now where they're not sparring hard. Um, cowboy barely spars at all. I don't think even spars. He does some tactical sparring where, you know, just tap touch, just move around. But he's mostly just doing drills. That's what I'm going to get into. He said he changed that after the Dos Anjos fight. He said when he lost a hot failed Dos Anjos, he just felt like maybe he had diminished himself too much with hard sparring.

Speaker 2:          01:36:31       Do a lot of these guys. They, they leave their career in the gym, you know, like you get no points. I got, there's a few guys that come to mind right now. I Jackson's who, who get punched in the head. I'm sitting there watching them and I watch a lot of fighting and I'm still a huge student of the game, um, but I'm not doing it myself. These guys laugh and like, you know, they'll get punched in, they start giggling or are they just. And that's the dumbest shit to me. Every like getting punched in the head pisses me off if I leave practice with a headache, I'm pissed, you know, I feel like, uh, I just took away from myself or just there was one more punch I could have saved for an actual event. And so right now, um, you know, I have a great chin. I've never been wrapped or wobble. Um, and uh, I want to keep it that way. I'm going to preserve my myself, um, because the skills will come. Um, but you know, that brain wants, wants, is a yellow, is yellow forever

Speaker 3:          01:37:21       Jello forever. And that's a security thing when you see guys go, when you see a guy like maybe chuck Liddell was one of the best examples ever because he had an iron jaw at one point in time. He was just indestructable. And then he saw, he just get wobbled by shots that normally he would just eat like, like a tic TAC. Yeah. Yeah. And when it goes, it just goes and it does not come back. I'm saving my shit. Joe, I hear you saying I want you to now Jackson's is such a crazy place because it's a hotbed of mma talent and it's a, it's a magnet for talented people to come there to get better because they know they're gonna be training with a bunch of animals there. But I'm hearing now with the opening of the new place that you just, you guys just got so many tough dudes come in. They're trying to make a name. Right? Do you have an issue with that when it comes to sparring where guys want to try to make a names barring, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:38:08       I personally don't have an issue with it. So me, uh, since we've had our new gym, um, it's this gigantic facility and we need people to pay the bills. So we literally, we allow a lot of people to come into the gym who I don't think are always qualified to be in the gym, um, but we allow everybody to come. And so anybody off the street, like any normal person? No you can't. No. So our gym manager, he does have an extensive, like a tryout thing that he does where he puts you through his jujitsu wrestling and kicking and striking and make sure you are knowledgeable about the game. So you have to have experience,

Speaker 3:          01:38:42       like how much experience do they have to have? They have to be like an amateur MMA

Speaker 2:          01:38:45       fighter. There's a lot of damage belt in Jujitsu. Like you just, you can't, you can't be a guy off the street who don't know. She has no shit. But outside of that, you know, if you have a general idea of martial arts and you know, that we were opening the door to a lot of people right now. So

Speaker 3:          01:38:59       pro fight jam or do they offer classes for beginners

Speaker 2:          01:39:02       amateur classes? Um, so have, you know, almost nothing. You're in the amateur classes. And then there's the pro pro pro practices where you literally get, you know, guys who aren't very knowledgeable training next to me and Holly Holm, cowboy cerrone, and you know, so it's, it's, it's a fan experience for sure. And it's an experience of a lifetime for a lot of people. And I'm happy for a lot of these guys who come in here inspiring my shield. I was against the train with me and the rest of us, uh, because I can only imagine wanting to, you know, you get to play ball with Lebron James and you just got out of college or you never went to college. Like I am happy for them as long as they don't get in my way.

Speaker 3:          01:39:41       Did. That is the big difference though, is someone who wants to come and play with Lebron James, you know, you want to make a name for yourself. So with me, you could dunk on Lebron James and were like, oh, I can't believe you did that. But. So the difference between that and fighting

Speaker 2:          01:39:54       I have, I have a way of, of not letting this affect my game personally. Um, I'm a, I'm a decent judge, like I can read people's character a little bit and uh, have, have I see you for the first time. You are obviously about to 62. Oh, five whatever to 20 and you, it's all about the way you look at me. So if you come into the gym and you even look like you have an ounce of a chip on your shoulder or like an ounce of Holy Shit, that's John Jones. I'm getting ready to, to spar him today. Like alright, like anything weird that's going on with your eye contact with me then I'm just not gonna mess with you. Say Hi to you and welcome to Jackson's and say, hey man, do you want a spar? I'm like, Hey, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:40:39       I just, I don't have any room for, for people trying to prove anything with me. There's a lot of that there. Isn't there? Yeah, it happens. So me, the best way you can work with me when you come to Jackson and just come up and introduce yourself, be kind, be polite, be respectful and um, show me that you are here to get better and uh, and that you are not here to, you know, even some guys that come in and ask for a picture of their first day here and I'm just like, it's like do earn, like why don't you come here, work your ass off for a few days, few weeks or whatever, and then get to this place where you feel like you're comfortable to expert picture instead of just being here and being a fan. People want those fucking pictures is instantaneously. Yes. Like Bro, you're here, you're in the church right now. You're in the met. Like you don't take a picture here. Like, you know. Yeah. I don't know. I just know what you mean. No, like, yeah, you should. That's not where your mind should be at facebook page. Right? Yo, look, look, wide trailer today is just like I told you I was bad motherfucker. Yeah. Or Yeah, you'll see that they'll tag you in a pitcher and his thing had just trained with the boat and really we didn't even train together. We like you were just in the room.

Speaker 2:          01:41:46       But um, but I do see the benefits of habits. So many new people coming in. I mean everyone has something to teach and you can learn from, from anybody from any country if you will, if you have an open mind enough. And a lot of the guys come in with a great attitude and they're just really grateful to be there and there. And they, um, they go with a lot of the top dogs and you know, we can kind of beat him up a little bit, you know, because they're the new guy or whatever. Um, but every once in a while you get that one guy was something improving it. And I've really found, came up with a great way to protect myself from those types of people. But you've run into those. Um, most people, most people, like I'm always very defensive when I'm going with the guy who I felt like he could be trying to prove something, like even when we're drilling, my defense is always on.

Speaker 2:          01:42:31       I don't, I don't give someone the opportunity to take a swing or ticket punch. I've had one guy hit me with a monster is overhand, right while we're drilling. And that was intentionally to, to knock me out. And uh, instead of retaliating, I just, I said, uh, I said, man, you okay? And he's like, uh, yeah, I'm around. I'm sorry, I just, I don't know what happened. And I was just like, okay, well that was, that was fun, man, that's working with you, will never ever work with you again. At one guy punched me in the balls intentionally to not too long ago. And uh, and that was his last time ever trained with me as well. So it's smart to stay away from you, but you do find those disturbed people that get involved in fighting and um, they do want to take a chance at a guy like Jon Jones take a swing at you.

Speaker 2:          01:43:22       Man, we'll connect and knocked him out, knocked out Jon Jones. I go like a few times that it has happened to, uh, I'll, I'll let my teammates, now I'm going to match what you're trying to do to me. So, you know, don't be surprised if I fuck you up with something that's a little bit more than what you would do to a trading partner if, if I realize you're trying to hurt me. Do you meditate, John? I used to meditate a lot. Now I'm more big into visualization. When did you use to meditate? I'm right around 2000, around 2010, 2011. Um, I went through this huge spiritual thing where I, um, I became obsessed with, um, the power of the mind and um, I got into a deep, like really deep just um, meditation and visualization and just realizing how powerful our minds actually are. Like how we really do paint our world with our thoughts and our level of self belief.

Speaker 2:          01:44:18       And so, um, right around 2010, um, I just took myself to this different mental level where I took myself on being an average joe kind of. You'd probably hate every show. Uh Huh. That's aggressive. It wasn't used to that name. Such a goofy name. It's good. It's like a blank. It's like cardboard. There's nothing to it. Yeah. So I took myself on being very average minded to actually believing that I was the shit and believing that I could be the shit and that I could be the goat and be the greatest and never lose into like I take myself to a different place mentally. And it, a lot of it came from, um, mental practice and meditation and visualization and just seeking knowledge from people who are strong believers because like I'm Les Brown and Tony Robbins and guys like that. I just became really obsessed with just learn about the power of the mind. So I used to meditate. Now I just kind of, I have a lot of things that have stuck with me, a lot of ways of believing that stuck with me that just subconsciously I know who I am and what I'm capable of and how I believe apart from my mind actually is

Speaker 3:          01:45:31       I'm a firm believer in meditation because I believe that human beings can get caught up, especially someone involved in a very difficult endeavor like you are. You can get caught up in the momentum of your life and sometimes it's very hard to reset. It's a very hard to separate yourself from it and get a balanced and as much as you can objective perspective, and I think one of the best ways to do that is to take time. We sit and you close your eyes and you do nothing and just concentrate on your breathing and just just set it all aside and extract yourself. Extract your consciousness from the momentum of your life and I think a lot of people don't do that and they get caught up in this hurricane of existence where everything is just constantly going on. Your phone won't stop ringing. There's fucking people knocking at your door. You got this going on that going on and you got to go catch this flight. No Shit, you got fight coming up and Oh shit, you got this and that. And sometimes you lose yourself. You lose yourself in that wave of life.

Speaker 2:          01:46:34       I definitely lost myself at one point in my life. Um, and I feel like right now I'm at this position where I am, I am myself and I can see John Bones Jones and I'm like, I can like look at my career from a fan perspective. You get what I'm saying? And um, and actually make fun of myself like, Damn you fucking idiot. Like what have you done? Like, you know what I mean? Like, um, I, I have, I have a good way of detaching something inside of me and, and, and seeing what's happening and okay, oh no, it's not over. You've got to do is just do this, do that, do that. And you get what I'm saying. I'm so, I'm not, I don't, I'm not necessarily meditating these days, but I do have the capability of taking away who I actually am at this point and realizing that this is just a part of me or this is just a situation in my life.

Speaker 2:          01:47:33       This is my actual life. This isn't my, this isn't my final destination, this is just a small moment in time that I'm going through right now. You get what I'm saying? I get what you're saying. So, um, so that, that's my form of meditation. I step away from terrible situations and look and look at myself as if it's the future and I'm looking back on what's happened to me or what's happening and I say, okay, how can I get myself out of this? How can I make this better? What do I need to do to turn this around? What do I, you get what I'm saying. Being completely emerged in the moment and thinking that, oh, I can't get out. Like, you know, so

Speaker 3:          01:48:09       not said earlier. The UFC two. Oh, five was in December. No, November locked up due to a five. Oh, two. Oh, five, 500, sorry. What I'm thinking of in December, when is your grappling match with Dan Henderson? December 11th. The stats. December 11th. Okay. That's what I'm fucked up on. Um, what is this is this is this Ebi rules? So this is submissions, chills, Sonnen's. I think that the president of it or something like that. Yeah. Then we have the, you have the information for all that. Let's put it up to tell people how they could see that. What, what made you decide to do this? Just to mix it up while you're off.

Speaker 2:          01:48:41       Yeah, I uh, uh, they reached out to me. I did like a small, a grappling event. Like I was at an autograph signing. I saw that. Yeah, some guy was like, hey, you ever roll? And like competitively. And I was like, no, actually I haven't since 2009 or something. Like I did one Jujitsu match my whole career and I want it but for some issues against these, these guys or whatever. He's like, man, you should come over and roll with me. And I'm like, what build are you? And he's like, I think he, the guy who challenged me was like a purple belt or something. And I'm like, uh, you know, I really don't do that type of stuff. I, you know, I would have to go home, I don't have any clothes or anything. And he's like, oh, we were selling gs over here in rash guards.

Speaker 2:          01:49:19       And I'm like, I was like, I don't think I'm going to real man. Like I, you know. And so he's like a, well at least come over and say hi. There's a lot of kids over there. A lot of people who would just love to see you come. So some support to the Jujitsu community. I'm like, all right, I could do that. And so when I went over there after my autograph signing, there was a bunch of people standing around and I was greeting everybody and the guy was like, hey, like are you going to roll with me or what? And I was just like, in a lot of people heard them and I was just like, I feel like when someone's trying to a, I feel like someone wins when they call you out and you don't oblige them. Right. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          01:49:56       So I was just like. And this guy's head is, it's a small victory knowing that I backed down and it's, we're not punching, it's, it's Jujitsu, right? So no one's going to get hurt. It's just like, you know what, let me live a little and just do this, you know, I'm sure the kids are gonna, love it and people are going to. So I, uh, I was like, all right, give me a rash guard. So they gave me a rash guard and I literally, I didn't even warm up. I just got to do one of these. And then I ended up tapping these two guys out fairly quick. And um, I think some of these people are from submission underground. They saw those videos and they're, they're starting this new promotion, um, where they're actually paying fighters pretty with that. Like they're taking care of the athletes. You know, really? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:50:39       Do People Watch it on paper view? Is that what it is? So I think you can watch it online. You could stream it online for a price. Okay. And um, so here it is a, okay, it's flow grappling.com. F L O grappling.com, Sunday, December 11th at 2:30. And I think this is Ebi rules. If this is the shale sunnen thing, so to see if that, if you could see that in there, Jamie, scroll up and see what the rules are.

Speaker 2:          01:51:04       I, I still don't even know what the rules are. I think it's the mission only.

Speaker 3:          01:51:08       Yeah, submission only, but I think Ebi rules is a Ebi rules is a very interesting to get me. But Ebi is Eddie Bravo, invitational rules. What he did is he figured out a way to avoid draws and what he does is he has guys, they fight for a or they grapple for a determined time period. Then at the end of the time period minutes I heard, yeah, they exchange a bad positions. Like one guy will start off. Well you start off what's called spider. So spiderweb aside, control with, not the arm bar locked up, but the arm hooked, you know the arm hooked so your you have your legs across the arms, trapped and ready go. So the guy on the bottom is trying to escape. You're trying to hold him down or you can start off with the over under from back control so you don't have a choke locked in, but you have over under.

Speaker 3:          01:51:55       You have both hooks in and you're on the back and they say ready, go. So it's how fast the person could escape versus how fast you could submit them. At the end of the exchange back of what? Say if you submit your guy and then he has an opportunity to try to submit you. If you submit him faster than he submitted you, you went. If you submit him and he doesn't submit you, you went with your escape. Both escape and he'd do it again. And then if you both escape again, you do it one more time and then they calculate all the time it took for each one to escape. And the person who has the least amount of time and escape the quickest winds up winning. I'm winning this shit.

Speaker 2:          01:52:33       Dan Henderson quite a bit smaller than you two. Yeah, I would imagine. Yeah. I wonder how much you weigh right now.

Speaker 3:          01:52:39       [inaudible] 85. And I don't think he's cutting a whole lot of weight. It's not a big guy, you know. And um, it's interesting like him fighting Michael Bisping, I think that's probably going to be his last fight. A lot of people thought he should have won that fight. Super close fight. He retired and he argued in. Yeah, I think he did. I think he decided that's it.

Speaker 2:          01:52:56       Yeah. So I'm sure this means a lot to them to be able to be able to beat me even in a grappling match. That's quite the way to end your career. Yeah. So I don't know how hard he's training, but I've, I'm putting a little effort into it for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:53:07       Yeah. Will you tell me before you just getting really in love with Gigi?

Speaker 2:          01:53:10       I do. I do love Jujitsu. Yeah. My, my, my professor has a, he's a great coach, man. They call them to say, I think it's Portuguese for like buck tooth or something like that, but his real name, Roberto all car. He's several times world champion Jujitsu. I think it'd be funny magazines quite a few times and he's won all these. That's huge. All these world champion, I think he's a five time world champion. Wow. Um, and he, he literally is right there with me every practice and you know, he knows that have, I've never done training, but he, um, he uh, he doesn't settle like I'm technically a white belt, but he's, he, every position, he's like, you know, you got to do this right? You got to do, put your hand here. They'll make this type of protecting the super technical and that's great. I feel like I'm getting pretty good right now.

Speaker 3:          01:53:59       That's awesome man. If you just dedicate yourself to that before you know, you come back, you'll, you should got like, you, you have a big jump.

Speaker 2:          01:54:05       Yeah. People are going to hate me, bro. I'm going to. My is going to be like, oh my. I'm just going to take people out for her care to ride your ass out, submit you like don't expect any more standup striking for me. Really. I'm joking. I'll tell them, who knows what you're going to do right now. I don't know. I'm going to do at this point, but I'm getting better and I'm preserving myself.

Speaker 3:          01:54:26       Elizabeth, it's good to see you. Smile. See laughs. Good. See, happy. It's good to see you optimistic about your future and I think you've got a great perspective right now and I really hope you keep it together man. Oh, I'm a big fan as a person, as a fighter. I'm glad we did this. I am too. I am too. All right. All right brother folks. We're done for today. See Ya. Bye. John Jones.

Speaker 5:          01:54:51       That was fun.
