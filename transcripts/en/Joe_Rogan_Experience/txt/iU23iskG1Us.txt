Speaker 1:          00:00:01       A fuckers were alive before we even say anything. I have to do a favor for Ari. Should fear are you should fears new show his show brother. This is not happening on comedy central is starting a new season, starting season two and r. He really wants to get great stories from comics that you guys all enjoy. So what are you suggesting you do? Is Perhaps tweet him, uh, suggestions and also tweet the comics that you would like to see perform on his show. Basically everybody's got some fucking wacky story. Just one wacky story. And if you've ever seen this is not happening. It's standups telling crazy stories about either things that have happened to them on the road or it during life or what have you. It's just a slightly different form of standup. So season two is about to begin. And Ari would like you to just tweet at anybody that you would think would be. Don't harass anybody. You don't twitter bond people. That shit's gross. People that asked me to twitter bomb, Joe, that's a great way to never get on this podcast. I, it's annoying. It's annoying as fuck. I don't like it, uh, but this is not that. What he wants you to do is just get the word out about it and, and tweet to him. Anybody that you would like to see on it that would, that would help as well. Right. You fucks gentlemen.

Speaker 2:          00:01:25       Hey Man. What's up brother? That's funny you say that because like I would see for like a year people go Joe Abdeen on your podcast and I'm like, that's the worst way to get me on.

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       Well, not necessarily if you told them to do it again would be the worst way. We never did know. You never would, but a lot of people did suggested and I watched you on to dom irrera a podcast because of it, which is fucking hilarious. I've never seen donald rare life and the laugh factory. First of all, dom's great guy. Hilarious comic, but it's a fun podcast and you were really funny on that fucking show. Oh thanks man. Let's rock and roll stories. God Damn Dude. I mean you, you fucking, you came into comedy it through a really weird way.

Speaker 2:          00:02:07       Yeah. I came to fucking long way 25 years the long way, 25 years of music played me as 25 years. But the funny thing is, uh, when I was a kid I wanted to do comedy, but there was no kids doing comedy, you know, it's not like now you can go to a camp or you can just do whatever, you know, go to the comedy camp for kids. That's how tiffany was started. Laugh factory comedy camp as it like a 13 year old and same with Melissa in your and uh, but when I was a kid and I'm 49, so I grew up on the first couple of seasons of Saturday night live and I was like, I want to beat John Belushi. GotTa be him. But where can you be in? Except for sixth grade?

Speaker 1:          00:02:52       Well, there's open mics and stuff like that. Like where'd you, where'd you start out? Where were you living when you were? I

Speaker 2:          00:02:57       grew up in the bay area, you know, and uh, San Francisco, there was a mix, but I'm like, you know, eighth grade, you don't know about that. There's no internet or anything. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:03:07       And so you had already gotten into music.

Speaker 2:          00:03:09       I started playing music and then the years just flew by because the neighbors piped music and, and I love. I loved rock and I love comedy. And the seventies it was the same. Yeah. Cheech and Chong Carlin. Richard Pryor said ACDC, Ted Nugent, van Halen. They were just the same to me. It put one record on and then the other. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:03:29       Yeah. You. So you lived next to musicians, is that what got.

Speaker 2:          00:03:33       Well, people in my neighborhood, we all loved rock and they were like, let's play. Let's play in bands. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       do you think of that wasn't around that you would have gotten into stand up early?

Speaker 2:          00:03:42       Well, here's the thing. Standup was huge in San Francisco in the eighties, man. Yeah, we had bobcat. We had a bobby Slayton, Robin Williams. Uh, we had the uh, that morning show with Carrie snow and all those guys, you know, it was huge, but I just didn't know how to do it. And I was probably scared. I remember I saw dice and I was like, I'm going to try comedy, and I did one time at this bar, mcnear's in Petaluma and I went in and I was just trying to be like, hey, look at those tests and I swear it was silent. I was like, fuck you, and I thought this is how you do it. Right? And Man, I was tossed out of there of course

Speaker 1:          00:04:28       intangible and you see a guy like dice that can say like some of the most offensive shit first of all because you know him and you know, like the character, but there's also, there's something about the way he did it and like if you're a young kid and you see it, you think you could go do it too. You don't realize how stupid it sounds until it comes out of your mouth and you realize like, oh wait a minute. He's been doing this for a long time.

Speaker 2:          00:04:48       Time. Yeah, it's established in about. I saw dies in 88 at the store and she really. Well, I used to hang at the store and my buddy would like was dating the headway to Sarah and and I'd probably rock and Hollywood and then we'd go to the store because it was huge. Was that before or after? He had become gigantic before. Because I remember seeing him and then I think like a year later he was on the Rodney thing and that's like, that's that guy I was telling you guys about, but he would do Monday nights and he would go on and, and all the rockers would go. The rockers would be like, you gotta see this guy man, and you go down there and he'd come out. He'd be like, look at this whole, hey, be like, what the fuck is this guy? You're not getting beat up. This guy was another guy laugh laughing. He goes, what are you left and that you're a fucking asshole. And that guy would get up and leave. And then it was awesome, man. You know?

Speaker 1:          00:05:45       Yeah. I call it mean dice. Just two different dices. There's dice, there's mean dice and mean dice will start picking on people in the audience and fucking just lay into dudes for like 10, 15 minutes and you see, they're like, smile at

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       first. I think I'll eventually get tired of picking on me. Move on to the next guy. No, I'm not done with you. I'm not done with you yet. Please be definitely. What the fuck man came to see a comedy show. I didn't want to be a part of it. Brutalize people, radical but hilarious.

Speaker 2:          00:06:17       It was radical back then. You know, everybody's just flying around a coke and his eighties and there's rock bands and and great comedy going on.

Speaker 3:          00:06:25       That's what's different now. That's a big thing that's different now is coke. The comedians are not on coke. There's not a lot of comics on coke. That's all we'd. There's a few that drink, but as far as like doing coke, maybe a couple of them might do it, but it's not like a Kennison thing were. They're all just getting blasted like you've heard Mark Marin's Kennison stories. Awesome. The fucking, the one about doing coke for like 78 hours and hallucinating for a year. He was hearing voices for a fucking year. He had voices talking in his head for a year after that.

Speaker 2:          00:06:57       That was the era man. I mean, I did coke every. Not every day, but like all of the time he just did coke. It was just what you did, man. It was rock coke and, and you know. And it wasn't about getting high. It was just about. Keep Rolling. Let's keep this rolling. Man. Rock. You don't want to quit? No. They want to go to bed. Let's go bowling. Then the liquor store will be open. We'll hit that. Then we'll go to this party and the canyon. Oh God. That's great. Open. It's fun. That's insane. It's crossed out.

Speaker 3:          00:07:27       I worshiped sleep so much now. I'm like, I know when you're young you'll put that sleep off. Just like I could stay up. I've done that many times. Just stayed up and just figure it out. Go to bed tonight. You go to bed tonight. Just ride it out. And then the last few hours of your day, you're just a Zombie. Just were such bitches. We need sleep. We don't get that sleep. You're like working at like 40 percent capacity. Like you have to struggle with everything you do. Yeah. Hilarious.

Speaker 2:          00:07:54       Right? Like I get angry when I don't get sleep, man. Fuck this crowd.

Speaker 3:          00:08:00       I remember being young though thinking like just feeling like shit after pulling an all nighter and thinking the difference between me then and me now is I'm probably more aware of how I feel like shit now I'm more aware of what my body actually requires. When you're 20 years old and you do something like that, you don't think anything of it. You just go. One was taller.

Speaker 2:          00:08:20       Yeah. Yeah. The endurance is crazy. When you're young, you're just, it's weird. You can lay there and when you hear your body working, that's scary. When it's just gone,

Speaker 3:          00:08:29       boom, boom, boom, boom. And you think about what you've made it do.

Speaker 2:          00:08:33       It's just all booze and drugs in you and you haven't eaten in a couple of days that sprouts. So how old were you when you got into stand up? A 44. I've been doing it for five and a half years. Exactly last week. Twenty 600 spots. That's a fucking hustle dude. It was weird. Joe. This is a true story. When I started thinking of doing comedy, all the guys though have during the forties, you know, it's like you see K, uh, Tom, papa was watching a lot burger and I had, I was really naive thinking like that. It's not an age thing like rock, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       Dr Rosa, Rockstar. There's only a few guys that get to that Mick Jagger level where you can do whatever the fuck you want

Speaker 2:          00:09:19       and they're looked at as like eno, old rockers or whatever. But comedians aren't looked at as old comics. They're looked at as comics because they're, the. Most of the killers are in their forties. You know, the guys I left.

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       Well, there's, there's something about your insight when you get into your forties that is probably missing when you're in your thirties. So can you throw that. You can be really funny when you're in your thirties, but it's very rare that you find someone in their thirties that has like the insight of a Louis, c, k, like the point of view, the unique perspective of a burger. You know? It's like, it takes a lot of living to become that guy.

Speaker 2:          00:09:56       Yeah. If you got it, you have to travel or think. Yeah, you do.

Speaker 1:          00:10:00       You may have to come to their own. You have to understand your own bullshit too, which a lot of times you don't yet when you're in your thirties, when you're in your thirties, even if you're really funny, you might have some funny points. You probably don't understand your own bullshit yet.

Speaker 2:          00:10:12       Yeah. You got to admit to yourself and figure it out. I'm fucking shitty in some ways. Yeah, and then you talk about it on stage. Did you

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       go to aa or one of those things where you stand on a podium and make people laugh? That's how a lot of guys start.

Speaker 2:          00:10:26       Yeah, and I didn't do that. What happened was I drank and did coke every night, but I sang every night and had three guys in my band. I was losing my voice, so I go to the doctor and he goes, you can't drink alcohol. It dries out your folk accords, you've got like what they call pre notes, which is like calluses on your vocal cords like Adele God or Steven Tyler or as Paul Stanley, and you got to go in and get them lasered off. You won't be able to sing for six months and when the, when you're making a living even two days off, even with comedy, that completely makes the machine crumble. So my guys are like, hey you, you, you can't drink. You know, we've got, we've got to eat. And I felt like that too. I was like, alright, I gotta quit for a little bit and see what happens.

Speaker 2:          00:11:14       Then after three weeks went by, I felt fantastic and and I just never looked back. She never got it lasered? No. What I did was he told me two things. Quit drinking. Don't talk all day and don't talk after gigs and I just chilled for like three weeks and they slow and a lot of Ricole was throat coat tea and uh, and, and, and the number one thing I did wrong, which people don't know was when you clear your throat, it's the worst thing you can do when you go to the banks and vocal chords together. And that's the worst thing you can do for maybe just a bitch. And I spoke with my vocal cords. Don't mind rumbling a little bit.

Speaker 3:          00:11:56       Welcome cards, lift weights to getting jacked, running hills. So you, that was what made you quit drinking like, well, I hadn't hit a rock bottom.

Speaker 2:          00:12:06       Cool. I mean I was getting pretty radical. I threw a beer and an anr guys face

Speaker 3:          00:12:12       that. What's an a and r guy that's a radio artist residence. The guy that signs, you know, record labels. Oh really? Yeah. So we're doing a showcase for what does it stand for? Artists and residents. Representative

Speaker 2:          00:12:23       mentors are a represented artists were relations, customer relations. You threw a beer in his face. We're doing a showcase and there was a bunch of record labels come down to see us. They're all hot and right before we go on a, they all start leaving our managers like, I don't know what the fuck's going on. They were all leaving and so he calls him the next day and they go, well, such and such said he signed you guys, uh, yesterday at lunch and so we left. It was like a scam. He did take and watch this on his own. So I saw him about a month later I was pretty drunk at an awards show and I just had a beer and just right on his face and topics and I was like, yeah, that's probably not good.

Speaker 3:          00:13:09       Good for the business.

Speaker 2:          00:13:10       Later though, I seen him later and he's like, that's pretty pretty gangster and really gangster. Yeah, he knew it was like, that's like the GNRH or rockers

Speaker 3:          00:13:20       crazy. The fuck the guns and roses era. Did you, were you around for that? Yeah. Did you see them come up?

Speaker 2:          00:13:27       I saw him come up big time. Yeah. Uh, I played in that whole scene, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:13:32       like, man, that seems like one of the weirdest errors of Hollywood because it seems like a rock and roll era that nobody really saw coming like a late eighties, I mean outside of them. And there was, there's quite a few big bands from back then, but not necessarily big bands from La, you know, they were so much better than everybody else.

Speaker 2:          00:13:50       You had them. And Jane's addiction really, those were the two and they played gigs together and stuff. When you think about the two styles are totally different, but they're both the uh, the recipes are the same danger and whenever you have something really fucking dangerous, it's gonna. It's gonna hit with kids because you know, you're coming out of that Reagan era and everything's kind of shitty and it's like comedy was big in the eighties, you know, when it's bad, people grab onto it and you had a long time, have a bad music, you know, you had a bunch of Super Glam spandex stuff and then this thing comes in. Welcome to the jungle and it feels real. And the whole record is good. That's why it made it. It wasn't one, two songs.

Speaker 3:          00:14:35       Yeah. The record's fantastic. But if you look at the original video for welcome to the jungle, he had t up here. He's on the borderline of the Glam thing. Like somebody must've talked him into dressing like that, or he didn't know any better yet, but he hair was like Farrah Fawcett

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       or something. She's seen Dean's hair, man. It's just pictures that we could see online on instagram page or anything that we could find. The Dean del Rey. There's tons of pictures of me on there from the old days they find me will find it. Well, I want to see axl rose first. Welcome to the jungle. Yeah. Because it changed. Then it was black bandanas and greasy hair and the heroin. Look, he went from the hairband look to the heroin. Look, now you know,

Speaker 2:          00:15:20       I remember specifically seeing them. This was the turning point. They were grinding out and the record came out. You know that record failed when it first came out. People don't know the first single bombed. Really? What was the first time? The jungle, that was the first bomb dudes like it, but it wasn't, you know, it took. We had to wait till you get the sweet.

Speaker 4:          00:15:39       Was there. Look at that photo. Photos. Slightly grungy, but you know what it is. It's like you tried to be grunge there. You worked it, you know like that's your hair. Doesn't stick up that watch. No, no. That's hairspray. She worked in a chemical plant.

Speaker 2:          00:16:01       You gotta think though, man, that is this era. When you look at this, and I always describe this to people and you have tattoos. I have tattoos in this era of the eighties when you had tattoos, that meant you were never working a regular job at that time. Now you look at Chipola, you work at starbucks wherever, but at that time that meant no one was hiring. You accept construction or landscaping. You weren't going to get a job, so that was a c. I mean he has multiple giant tattoos to. Yeah, he just went out now

Speaker 4:          00:16:37       18 year old kids that have sleeves. Exactly. Side food boobs in fifth grade. I always say I don't think I got enough tattoos to work at Chipola yeah, and ladies, what's up with the. The inspirational quotes below the side boob. So that is becoming. That is the, that is the fucking barbwire around the bicep. The 2015 errors, the inspirational quote on your side boots, the new tramp stamp. It's always like some fucking Ralph Waldo emerson quote or or something biblical. It's never good. Like a Charles Bukowski thing. You know, like I'm a day drinker. He was, he was another one. That's one of my favorite representations of Hollywood. God

Speaker 2:          00:17:21       love you. I know. That's why I like, like I like you. I like guys that are dangerous and, and I'm attracted to the edge. A dislike.

Speaker 4:          00:17:31       Are you living on the edge? It's funny. Dean is now addicted to candy though. I went over and crash cans full of candy wrappers.

Speaker 2:          00:17:46       That's why I like listening to the ego because it's like I'm trying to get healthy

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       for real. I quit caffeine. I don't smoke. I don't drink because I don't want to die. I worked seven nights a week, man, and I don't ever eat fast food ever, but you can do. It's bad. Well, Ari and I are trying to quit, so we cut one day. I've. I'm up to two days now. Sometimes three. Yes. Sugar can be really addictive. You know why it's brutal because you've been doing it since you were two. You start drugs maybe when you're 18, 19, but to your cereals, loaded. Your drinks are loaded. Fucking breads loaded. Fucking broad, right? The first day I quit smoking, I eight, six packs of Mentos and now I have the hugest canker sores in my mouth so I can tell from from just eating too much candy and it hurts really bad. I don't know if it's from that though. It could be with you. It can be like you. What are you willing to analysts like? You've observed all your illnesses. Well, I know this one, this one came from Toronto.

Speaker 4:          00:18:51       You don't know where these sores are coming from. They just on your face so wrong. So we're going to. Toronto, man will be there next month. I love Toronto. Me To write the dudes up there, uh, I did that room and they were talking about you and they're like, what's the epic night? The comedy underground there. And they had the punk club. Yeah, they had a picture of it in there and stuff. And they're like, I've done it a few times. It's so good. That place is weird because it makes you realize you can get a secondhand buzz real easy. I used to think that like secondhand, like getting high second hand was bullshit. Not Enough fucking room. No Way. Go in that room. You can't even see the back of the room and the room is only 20 feet deep. You can't see it. It's the, it's one of the few places that actually made Doug Benson Green out where he passed out in the middle of the lobby.

Speaker 4:          00:19:41       And then Tony, Tony Hinchcliffe got off stage and he took off his shirt and went outside and almost fell down. Oh my God. I was headlining in there and I doing an hour and smoke weed and my 30 minutes in my throat was like someone shaved it with sandpaper. And then I was completely and I was up there like this kinda cool man. You know where I'm at? Yeah. They can hop box. Any person in the world. Just the air in there. It's so thc filters. No. Really Aaron there. None. None. No. It's all pots movement. And now they're all doing that. Um, that uh, dabbing. So they're straight zombies. That's correct. I mean they are. Zombies explained Dabbin. What's the difference between dabbing it? Smoking weed. They get this, uh, this is the wax, like the oil light. So I cash exactly. But it's even stronger they say. And then they've got this electrical fucking wand and they kind of rub it over it and then they suck in this, this, you know, this like the word straight thc. There's no weed. How does the uh, the, the, the waiver of what over it?

Speaker 5:          00:20:51       It's pretty much exactly like smoking crack foil. But it's in a nice glass thing. So you think it's not, it's hash or anything like that?

Speaker 4:          00:21:02       Yes, it's doing the exact same thing. But when you start seeing this guy who, uh, was my, what? He wasn't in an agent, he was my, it wasn't my agent. He was my manager's friend who was also an agent. He lit some Hash Hash on a, like a, um, a thumbtack. You put the piece of Hash on the thumbtack and lit it on fire, then put it under a glass. Oh yeah. And let it fill the glass up and they lifted glass. I'm going to go. Great. This guy is a drug addict. Yeah. That's all I could think of was this guy was a drug addict. Like if you just lit a joint, like I was just, I didn't, I had no idea what the fuck. So hey fuck hash was back then and look at all the tools and the English, they carry a briefcase with prosperous.

Speaker 4:          00:21:46       Like Ari and I were in Sacramento at the punchline and this guy goes, come out to the car. He opened his trunk and he had like a, a DAB center. What is going on here? So this guy's just hanging on there and she's sort of working it while he, uh, turning and she's pretty much burning it. But Joe, now they have state of the art things. They're like electric wand and and, and it rubs over it. There's no fire. It's like electric. This is why potheads have a bad name. Exactly. Total. He's guys waiting in line to get their brains obliterated.

Speaker 5:          00:22:17       I think I told you this, Joe, that I recently was in San Francisco and there was one of these places across the street from the comedy club and me, tiffany haddish and Tony went across the street to check out this damn place and there was like half of the people were homeless that were just sitting there spinning their money anywhere though. But it was, it was like being in a crack house and it was just, it looked like people were doing crack and people were passed out like a crack house.

Speaker 4:          00:22:45       The same thing because crack is like an elevated thing. Like you get whacked out. Right. But this is just zombied from we'd. Yup.

Speaker 5:          00:22:52       Yeah. And they are really Zombie though, Joe. I'm talking about you're looking at a guy two feet away and you're going to, this guy's fucking dead and you're doing comedy for them for the night of the living dead places. There's a place in north Hollywood, so the spot, the spot where where it's a dive bar and it's a comedy stage and me and Freddy Lockhart for try this place for me and Freddy Book took a hit and then we walked outside and it makes you cough and these meet me and Freddy cough for like 30 minutes and we couldn't even talk. I can't breathe and then we had to go on stage. Nobody was paying attention. They were looking through you. They were like figuring out like talking to Jerry and you're like, they have no idea what was going on. One guy was face down in onto the stage in front of me and I'm like, we're going to check on this guy

Speaker 4:          00:23:47       jokes. It's amazing. Their pot really can't kill you. If you had thought that was some of these dab guys with some of these people that are, that have these crazy contraptions like these ridiculous vaporizers somewhere online. Someone must've fucking hit the wall. Nobody. Nobody ever. I felt like I was dying on wait many times. Oh yeah. Wait, about five, six, seven years ago. I got back into we big time before I started comedy and I was like, Whoa, this isn't 80 sweet, you know, like one hit my heart with Guinness. It's definitely a totally different experience. But apparently this kind of weed was available if you, uh, you check the has been some scientists that have done some studies on the different strains and like what the pope potential potency. Apparently there was some pretty fucking strong weed back in the day, like Acapulco gold used to call it.

Speaker 4:          00:24:42       You could get ahold of some really strong weed, but the strongest we'd today is stronger than that and that weed was rare. So like, you know, like you'll get a hold of some today, but that's not that good. But most of the week today is pretty fucking good. It was really rarely you would get like quality California weed back then I just asked my uncle at the same thing and I was like, you know about it? He goes, no, there, it was available. I had heard of it, but he like, he's like, I smoked weed every day. I never saw it. I went to Cannabis Cup and uh, and you, you, they take it out there and you can vote on the weed. It's in Amsterdam once a year and then the winners, it's a big deal because the winter is, are these seeds for big money. That was a judge, judge at one in La. So it was a blizzard rated.

Speaker 4:          00:25:31       I have no idea what anything tasted liked. White widow number five. Give me a, like a box, like, and it had, you know, all those things that people do for vitamins where they have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, it's all labeled and top and you pop up each individual. They had one of those filled with weed and they give it to you a good fucking luck remembering what anything in that first three people you try one every year properly. It's like relationships. It's like your friend, like, oh, this is my friend's shit man. You know, like they, they don't check to see if anybody. And it's also just random. It's fucking totally random. Yeah. Standards Tastes pretty good. Like some of it has like a different kind of flavor to it, but not enough that you had awarded anything. I'm a black hash guy. I'm glad that more than anything it tastes great.

Speaker 4:          00:26:21       The what's Black Hash? Just black cash. It's like that oily black cash. It's made out of the oil and you can kind of pull it off. Like now it looks like a. Oh, like a ball, like a tar ball. He peel, peel a piece off. It's like, tastes great man. And it's a different high. Yeah. Well it's, it's when you eating hash, especially if you're eating it, if even if you're smoking, you're getting a different. It's, it's like a vaporizer high more than it's like a joint high. I like it better to you. Yeah, because it's, I think it's more mellow for me, you know? It doesn't seem to grab me and go, you're heart, you're shitting your pants. I always think I'm shitting my pants on weed. Like I feel like there's no, no feeling below.

Speaker 4:          00:27:06       I usually feel the opposite of feeling of too much feeling going on all the different processes that are happening, feel at all, but it does loosen up. The bowels now does get you where you want to take your Chinese shit. Scared of. When was the last time? When was the last time you smoked weed? Probably five years ago. Right when I started comedy I realized I had to quit because it was wiping out my short term memory. I'd be on stage in a bag. Fuck what's next? I couldn't remember. Wow. I could not remember what was next, but I can remember 20 years ago and this was a no party and back then the drinking was done. Oh yeah. I stopped drinking in [inaudible] 92. No coke, no booze since [inaudible] 92. And that's all because of the throat? Yeah, pretty much. And then I realized I gotta get my shit together. I burned it up hard joe. I mean hard. So like guys like Paul Stanley, Paul Stanley never drank, right? No he didn't. Those guys were a clean dudes. But you know, you can trash your voice. He you to think Paul every night. He's like, yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:28:05       yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:28:07       no, he, that's all he ever does. When he's, when he's talking, he's like,

Speaker 4:          00:28:17       he never stops there. I must be way easier to sing. Now. You got into your monitors there in the middle. Get the fuck outta jail with the boys. You ridiculous Picchu. Oh my God. On the left. That's me with tracie guns from La guns. What do these guys look like? They look the same possible. Fire up a photo. I think I have a photo like two days later of La guns have. Tracy does a podcast with me and right. There you go. There's us, there's tracy on the left. That's the guy on the right from the bullet. Boys do not look the same. I mean they didn't even remotely. Glasses. Look at my shirt, right? Snake. Steven, right? It's hilarious. Steven, right? Man, do you have the picture of you? And uh, that's. There was that dude have a che Guevara tattooed on his chest. I wonder how much he really knows about Che Guevara. There's a lot of people that got Che Guevara Tattoos that didn't know a goddamn thing about Che Guevara. He just wanted to look cool and I find it more old pictures of the roses. It's towards the beginning. If you're in my instagram, the beginning of the other one, it started my instagram feed, but when you very start, when I first started out or Jamiel fine. Yeah, he'll get it. So you did it for all those years you did music and then what, what made you decide to do like an open mic night?

Speaker 2:          00:29:47       Well, what happened was I stopped playing music basically because once the download and came in the illegal download and there's just no money for a, a, a mid level musician anymore. You know, like when I played music, you can play music for years and just be touring like the jam bands, you know, like a Kinda grateful Dead Blues Traveler, Black Crows, that kind of thing. And make some money selling cds and shirts. But once people just grabbed the cds, it was out like guys, we'd come home, we'd be like, we got 400 bucks. We'd been out three months. Yeah. So that's cool for me, but when he got band members with wives, they're like, Hey, you've been gone for three months, you have no money and no. So I stopped and I started working at Harley Harley Davidson. I was like, oh, I guess I'll just do this, but when you've been on stage 25 years it starts to fuck with it.

Speaker 2:          00:30:43       You're like, man, I gotta be here at nine and then I got to be here all day and for selling bikes. So you were like a bike sales over in van nuys. Wow. I actually liked it but it was, it. It's just so different from us at the death of a dream. Like I kinda really felt like that. Yeah, I felt pretty, uh, I was really depressed and I was angry. Yeah. Because I was just kinda like, fuck these guys, you know, you got a guy come in and you spend four or five hours, you're on commission and then they go somewhere else and they come over with their bike. Like, hey man, look, I bought one. They don't know that you're on commission. I guess I went over there, they had, they gave me a shirt and you're like, fuck, I made no money today, you know? Yeah. It really is.

Speaker 4:          00:31:36       It's annoying. The annoying thing about being a salesman, right? It's brutal. But there's

Speaker 2:          00:31:41       con or comedy as. I'm not like a sales. You know what I mean? Like, because you're, you're constantly trying to get stage time and, and with sales you're constantly hoping somebody says yes.

Speaker 4:          00:31:54       Salesmen is weird too because you're kind of a professional manipulator and a lot of, oh, it's horrible. I told her this, I got a lot of times you feel like a drug dealer because you're selling something to somebody that's proud they're probably going to die on, you know what I mean? Like what do you mean? Because they just don't know. They don't know how to ride and you're just there like here, like, Hey, you took the school, right? Oh yeah, yeah. And they're lying and they just rolled out and he goes, that guy has no idea. He's on two wheels and he's going under fan eyes boulevard right now. Either one of the most brutal streets. And I've been watching so many ever since I got rear ended the other day. I've been watching so many people texting in the fucking car. God Damn folks got to stop doing that. It's brutal. Oh everybody

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       thinks they can pull it off. And you see people doing this as they're driving, looking down and looking up, looking down, looking up like fuck. The amount of time you cover while you're looking down, going straight forward before you look up again. You're talking about sometimes 20, 30 feet bay at a time and that's 20, 30 feet. The you didn't hit the brakes at something popped up in front of you and that's too late. And boom. Old Ladies flying through the air because you just walked out into traffic.

Speaker 5:          00:33:05       Yeah man. I mean even even when you're not texting, how many times did the one on one or you're like, well fuck shit, look at this wall and now you're adding texting into it.

Speaker 1:          00:33:15       I've watched some lady with a kid in her car today. She was doing that thing that sometimes people they take driving and the it turns into like a sport. They try to like get in front of the car to the left. It was a two lane road and she was trying to get in front of, there was a guy to my right and there was a guy that was in front of us. There was like a little bit of gap between me and him and she was trying to speed and get into that gap and right when she was trying to speed someone else came into her lane, they weren't paying attention and she had a kid in her car and she had a slam on the brake and go flying into the, uh, into the side of the emergency role. And I watched her do it and I watched her afterwards. She was like touching the kid's chest and talking to him, trying to console him because the kid freaked out because she didn't need to do it. There was no, no reason to do it. And she drove normal. After that she was behind me. The entire whale. I kept an eye on her, but I was like this, this was just like a game, like she wanted to make that gap. Some

Speaker 5:          00:34:10       girl I was on Laurel Canyon and she came right up to me like right onto my ass and start flashing her lights, like what the fuck is this lady doing? And then she tries to pass me and it pushes me off the side of the road. As another car starts coming. Then she slams on the brake, goes behind me. I'm like, what the fuck? Like she literally tried to like sideswiped me and then she gets ahead of me and it kept slamming on her brakes and brake checking me. So finally, by the way, this is all on periscope. I finally got her ceiling up here. Now you want to watch wanting to get past that was like, look at this guy and I know I have a dash mount so it's just sitting there. But then we get to a stoplight and I could pull up next to.

Speaker 5:          00:34:54       I rolled down my window like, what the fuck is your problem? And said girl with her hair really short. She just sitting there like that and she takes off in front of me and it's brakes, checks, man, but what the fuck? A second light, same thing or whatever. Hey, hey Yo, you and she rolls down the window, gives me the SMIRK, like say like, like that. And then when it turns white she just tries to side slamming again. You should run into her and then killer. And then periscope. If I got her license plates, periscope murder. I got her license plate number and I realized how easy it is to get information from a license plate. I had no idea. It's just a $40 google search. What's her name? What's his guy? He's really hot though. So she gets a pass. She gets a pass passed so weak you will live your life in torture and you will never learn. That's true. Bone structure gives her a pass. She's like half Japanese. Half Mexican is just what is wrong with you? What is wrong with you son? Somebody sideswiped my car the other day. $7,000 worth of damage to my car. Just parked in front of my street and I had a drop cam and that that faces my front of my house and so I caught. I caught the person like driving by and it was so fast that I couldn't even see anything. It was just like they hit the car behind me, hit my car and was going on hammered probably 30 miles an hour. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:20       Wow. This happens like once every three months I'll drive down one of these little side streets. I was on a van, Owen and Van Owen had this car that someone obviously hit full speed in the rear and it was parked on the side of the road because people are texting or they're drunk or they fall asleep or something and those cars that are parked every couple months I'll see one just caved in on the side of the road and you know, someone just drove along and probably was like looking down at a booty call. Fuck.

Speaker 5:          00:36:51       Did you see that one there? Passed out like a month ago. She passed out in the middle of the highway and she just fell asleep, like pounding on the window. And she won't wake up and so he had to, I think he broke the window or something like that. I can't remember. But did she crashed somewhere else? She just stopped in the middle of the highway. Just took a nap. Cars were like full St Louis. She parked. It is right here to turn up the volume on a freeway. Cars moving behind the wheel of that car. Ten years breaking news track or had the only camera there is that ran alongside the car in the middle five. Try Breaking that window to get the driver to wake up and get her to HP officer. He's risking his life here. It's on a freeway. A woman has passed out. I guarantee you somewhere. A dude that is like I told you. I told you that crazy. That's why we broke up. She's pretty cute though. I'd give her a pass. That's okay. Honey. Off It. You just need a driver. I remember I was watching the Uber

Speaker 2:          00:38:03       Dmz and they're like rockstar crushes in the non cars in Hollywood hills. Like, Hey, I got to see this. I'm laughing. And then I knew the guy. Was it? It was this Guy Casey from this band a man. They're like a kind of a punk metal band, but he was, I guess he was drunk and he hit a car that he backed up to try to get away and the front tire came off and he didn't know she's pressing the gas in the car. Just drove right into all the other cars because he had no steering. Then they added on film.

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       Oh Man. It's just unbelievable that you're expected to drive two bars and then figuring out how to get home. That's ridiculous. The fact that everywhere you looked there handing out one of the most ridiculous drugs, it happens to you. It almost instantly take a shot of Jack Daniels within 10 minutes. You're fucking trash. How's that bottle of wine legal like that's like five glasses of wine. That's way beyond the legal limit for two people in a dinner, an hour, and I only had one when they say that. If two people just sitting at a dinner table drinking wine and it's a bottle and you finish the bottle off your both hands. Yeah. Yeah. You can't drive. No, everywhere you look, people are driving drunk everywhere you look. Friday and Saturday night, you know, go to a comedy show, any comedy show and those people sit there, offered the order, two, three, four drinks and then they get out of there and they drive.

Speaker 4:          00:39:29       Now it's like for, for cops must be like the easiest pickens ever on Friday and Saturday night and ducks and apparently they have those new things that you. For your iphone now it's like a breathalyzer for your iphone so you can just sit there and just check every, you know, so it's to be a steering wheel thing. Now there's a new steering wheel they're developed. It's going to know if you're drunk. Well yeah, it was just a CV to fund the story. It was just great being handed around Jesus Today on social media. So none of us are going to be able to drive anywhere, all be stuck at applebee's. You know, it's going to be like, man, it's going to be like the steroid tests for the UFC to go, whoa, hold up. Everyone's just fucking completely empty because no one's car starts. They would make that legal limit go up though if that happens.

Speaker 4:          00:40:14       No, they were not allowed to have a case of beer and two shots of. But no, they definitely would not. What they would do is, uh, everybody would be hiring their little brothers and sisters to drive them around the quiz. On the right side. Does bigfoot exists now, but nothing definite. That's the type of people that are it. What is that? Why k y? T O wk knows that mountain news. Oh my God. Some poll results. The snow is 73 percent. Eight point four percent is not sure. Not sure. Are the ones that are tuned into survivor man, book foot right now. Man, I don't know. When they ask less about the footage, you said no one really knows whether or not those boots. That's enough for me. That's a no for me. It looked like a dude in among your mask, but I'm telling you what, I love that big foot thing because just seeing the guys that they said, they're the ones that did that photo in 72 or whatever.

Speaker 4:          00:41:13       Well, this Patterson Gimlin footage, there's a guy named Bob [inaudible]. He's the guy who wore the big foot footage. You can see those videos of him walking next to the actual footage of bigfoot was just like that fucking guy in the monkey suit. Jamie. Jamie, what are you doing? You showed it to her. She pulled it down. It won't load. That's legit. Big Foot. That is bigfoot's. Actual foot. Totally real. Don't fucking hate bro. Love. I love that. I just thought I grew up in the seventies. I love, uh, that, that stuff that Leonard Nimoy would do like. Yeah. Remember he did the Noah's Ark one. He actually did the full movies. You could go. I went to the drive and southern Noah's arc one and the Ufo one. Oh, here it is. Drunk driving detector. So how does this work?

Speaker 4:          00:42:05       According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, approximately 10,000 people are killed by drunk drivers annually in the US. Look at this. The long arm of the laws handcuffing this young man and taking him to the slammer. Research developing to detection methods for the driver alcohol detection system. One method allows the car to analyze a driver's exhale, breath for alcohol content. See, that's annoying because I had a friend who got a Dui and they made him do that. Oh, they're gonna have like a that just smells your breath. Another method shines and infrared light into your fingertips and it reads it. Oh, it was used. Alcohol limit of ope point zero. Eight blood alcohol content as it's standard. It used to be owed nine right there. No one was one when I was growing up. Parents could. Hmm. I wonder why they made it my money. Make money. If you think that's what it is, or do you think it's because they realize that more people are actually crashing like that?

Speaker 4:          00:43:06       There must be some scientific basis for the one point. Oh, eight, isn't there? I don't know, but it seems to me that you should be able to go in and take a test like a weed smokers as well and be like, well, I've been drinking 25 years, so my limit should be true, but the problem with that is then you're going to push it even further. The guys who go, look, I looked, I did the legal limit. I'd do three shots, I can handle five, come on and you'll just keep pushing it, but if you know that if you piss or you blow and oh eight, you're fucked you, then you're not going to get drunk now or if you do, you can't really argue about it. I used to do these open mics. Joe and this girl had the the breathalyzer on her car and she would pay guys to go out and breathe in or ride so she could drive home [inaudible]. She would be drunk like where do you do? And so it looks like it's [inaudible] 98. In March of 98, President Clinton called for the promotion of a national legal limit under which it would be illegal per se, to operate a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of point zero eight or higher across the country, including federal property.

Speaker 4:          00:44:11       He was just trying to get people to not pay attention to this extra dirty freak. That guy, that guys. That was the last ones are the ones like and fucking relate to the real presidential dick slingers. I can't wait for him to be back in the history.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       Oh yeah, 100 percent. I don't think so. They did some polls, man. After the emails and stuff, people are just like, they're looking. First of all, people were looking for a reason to not like her because she's a woman. Let's just get that out of the way and the fact that she's a woman that's also a Clinton and it's a Clinton versus a bush. People are fucking totally tired of this dynasty thing that's been going on for the past x amount of decades where they just going back and forth, Bush to Bush to Bush. I mean the idea of a Jeb Bush became president after his brother fucked everything up and then his dad fucked everything up before that and if that's not our option, then the Clinton option and it's Hillary and Hillary. Hillary is. She's tied to a bunch of shady fucking things. That property stuff. Yeah, the Whitewater Shane from back in that thing that it's Arkansas, the Vince foster thing.

Speaker 1:          00:45:23       There's a lot of like weird shit, but that's the case with anybody that's involved in like high level politics like that. There's, there's. They got some shit on you before you ever even get in there. Otherwise you don't get in there. You can't be a politician to be clean. That's impossible. There's no way. You literally can't get to the highest level where you're running for president unless you've been completely compromised by special interest groups. That's the only way those cancer campaign contributions are critical and you have to sit down with those fucking corporation owners and the CEOS and they. They figure out what the fuck is going to go down, like how, how laws are going to be structured, what influence is going to get them. If this person gets into our office, they don't. They're not ambiguous about it. Now like maybe I can help you if I get in, give me a million bucks and went back and help you.

Speaker 1:          00:46:10       They know that this guy is going to make either regulations more relaxed or figuring out how to push things through or figure out that that's what politics are. It's all money now, it's the whole ball of wax when they talk about like the amount of time that a guy actually spends campaigning and trying to raise money, like as opposed to how much time they spend on actual work. It's. It's astounding. Campaign is all about raising money. I take their whole thing is about raising money and occasionally giving speeches. That's crazy, right? It's just whoever gets the most money wins, Donnelly. That you would have to have some insane amount of money spent just to try to make it into those debates. Just to try to get into the baits. Like the commission for presidential debates is a privately owned corporation, are privately owned institution. Like you can't just get in the debate. You can't say, Hey, I'm Dean del Rey and I've got some pretty good ideas and I'd like to run for president. No, you have to. You have to get more than I believe 15 percent on five different polls and it's the polls that day choose like they can. They can cherry pick. Like say if you're a guy like Ross Perot type guy that might fuck things up for them. They didn't anticipate that when Ross Perot came around and he spent a shitload of his own money, tried to run for president, ruined all their plans

Speaker 4:          00:47:31       right away. Afterwards they monkeyed with the numbers and change things. It made it even more difficult for an independent person to debate and the presidential elections. So to the average American, there's only two choices. You see those two assholes on, on television. You have your Republican debates and you have your democratic debates, and then when it breaks down to those two guys, those are the only two people running for president as far as you know, that's. That's a broken system. Like I'm 49. How old are you? 40 seven. I'll be 48 in August. Do you remember a good president? Yeah, will clam was good. People liked Clinton until he got caught getting a blowjob. Carter Carter man, Carter Sweetie. He smoked weed with what? Elvis on the roof. That's cool. Did he had the White House? That's what they say. Know? I never heard that. It's one of those fucking a rainbow bar and grill.

Speaker 4:          00:48:23       Family stories. No, I think it was like in an elvis song from motorhead. Tell you ever played a spaghetti. One time I met Elvis. He smoke weed with Jimmy Dean. Was it you that told me that? That, that classic Ron Jeremy Story about the rainbow and he is sleeping now. Nevermind. Supposedly he had. He's a narcoleptic or he just finds Jeremy Ron, Jeremy Sleep all the time and supposedly he was at the rainbow and I forget who told me this story. He says they looked over and ron just went spaghetti and fell asleep and getting the night somebody put him up and he had like spaghetti all over him and stuff. But here it is. Oh Willie. Oh, Willie Nelson and chip Carter. Chip car smoked a joint together on the White House. Oh, sees. See how the story changes harder though. Let's tell the stories. That's how that game of telephone grid telephone works.

Speaker 4:          00:49:20       It was like shipped Carter's Jimmy Carter's son. Is that what it is? It must be right. That's not the one that shipped Carter running. What's he doing, man? Because his brother had belly beer. Billy Carter was a mess and Clinton have a fucking mess of a brother too. I don't remember the mess of a brother. Kai. That's great. Yeah. The mess, brother. That almost ruins it for everybody. Smoked any of the Willie weed. He's got his own weed. No, no. Everyone has. Everyone has a skin diamond. Has her own leader. Just like four different strains named after me. I had one of them. Yeah. This. You can't look whatever the Willie Nelson weed is. He probably has nothing to do with it. Yeah, right. It's just they're paying him. Jimmy Carter was one of the guys that I was. I remember being young and listening to them talk and I believed him.

Speaker 4:          00:50:12       She was sincere in a way that a lot of these guys just don't. Some guys just. They seemed so phony. Carter, whether or not you agree with them or disagree with him. He seemed sincere and then it always bugged me that the Republicans had negotiated to release the hostages in Iran after Reagan was in office, so they had. They had made it a part of the negotiation to not release those people to make them look. I can hear right, but that that means that those people had to stay prisoner longer just for politics. Yeah. I mean the Republicans at the time should have been shunned just for that. Someone should have pointed that out. If they could prove it, that's if that was true. I don't know if that is true though. That might be one of those sessions. Be Carter on the roof with Elvis.

Speaker 4:          00:51:01       Carolyn with Andrew. It's actually Maroon five doing when you remember those gas wars. Joe Green Day with the odd and even plates. You could only buy gas every other day. Whatever your last number on your license plate was because the kids don't remember that. That was crazy out here. Are We? Oh yeah. Where'd you grow up? I was the east coast. It was in California. I didn't even play. I thought it was across the nation, but you could only buy gas on every other day if whatever your last number on your license plate was. Task Wars. It makes no sense at all. What if you just happen to run out of gas so you couldn't do anything? Well, it was during that whole. Well, that was the one who started making those really economical car. So it was when they were trying to figure out the Saudi oil situation.

Speaker 4:          00:51:49       Yeah, they were trying. That's when cars turned to shit. Exactly. When cars went from being these awesome beasts to these dog shit. Cars. Dog should car the seventies, the sixties, sixties or seventies is the worst dropoff of, of American cars ever. It took us until like the 2004 we recovered. Yeah. Yeah. Like remember the Mustang to. Oh, piece of shit. All those mustangs in the late seventies into the eighties mustang with ugly plastic nonsense. You go back to [inaudible] 69, mach one. Just look at one of those and then look at what happened in the eighties. Like how did you guys fall so far off? I. How did you do this? Isn't that crazy? Because that was mock ones are beautiful. All those old cars to this day. To this day, I mean, it might not be the most arrogant. They might not be the best as far as like the wind resistance and all that shit, but as far as like the looks.

Speaker 4:          00:52:43       Oh, I had a dodge super B, 70. It was a great car selling it right now for my buddy. I sold it to him 13 years ago. Now he's selling it. He's had it forever but is a listing for it. We'll get it sold right now. Oh yes. Listed. Just email me. Dean del Ray. Don't say a fucking tsunami warning email. You almost did it. Released your email address. I think there's a picture of it on my instagram now. It says B, five blue and it's got the c stripe and the crazy and it's just when you look at those cars and think that you could walk a car lot and 70 now I go, let me get that race car. Well that's what they're doing today. They are. I love the hell cat to all these cars today. They're way better. This is the first time where the new American cars, like the DOJ, they drive is so much better than the old ones, but still the old ones, they still look better.

Speaker 4:          00:53:43       Better. There's something about them like a 69 Camaro. There's something about. It was just like you can't. He can't beat it. They got that, has that classic muscle car, loved that car with the hideaway headlights. The four on the floor. He had the tick tock gauges and the wooden dash and wood steering wheel. Right. And the console. I had to have a man at the console and eight track player man. Those cars, they just nailed it. They nailed it for between 65 and it's tough to go after [inaudible] 73 now. Seventy three Kudos are still bad ass at 73. I think they still made a challenger in 73, but everything else, dog shit. That was the end. And the cars had already lost their power. They were already like butchering the power on them yet, but seventies cause the last hurrah. Seventy, 71 car. I love the 69.

Speaker 4:          00:54:34       Super B with the a 4:46 pack and the pistol grip shifter, you know? Yeah. By the time 70 rolled around, Mustang had already taken a downturn. It's true. They're just started to look weird and then. But the but the but, but by the time 70 rolled around the, the Kuda was just getting started as kills the Kuda suck before 70. Sure. I had the coo to the first one where it was and it was shorter and funky. Then they dumped the era and make it longer or they make a big body and it's killer, but they only nailed it for three years. Can you imagine that? They wouldn't. Seventy two, 73 and then everything after that, it's gone. It's true. Barracuda had it. So that was the last spark of the muscle car. That was the last remaining era. And now sometimes you'll see one go for a million bucks, like Cuda convertible.

Speaker 4:          00:55:24       Purple made three. $1,000,000 more an hour. Now Barry Jackson more. Now they're going for more. I know private collections that uh, they sell. They have like this rk motors in Charlotte, they have this big website filled with them and they had one on sale for more than a million bucks. It's crazy numbers matching ones. Yeah. I love that shit man. I'll talk to for hours on cars were the nuts man and I just like this one, you know, and I'll send them a photo in the middle of the night. He'll be like, Nah, this one. Well Corvette had some good years after [inaudible] 69. They had the 70 vet was still in those. Those sting raises to a pretty bad car. Seventy three is the last year and that once they get rid of that steel bumper, it's out. You know that same thing. Yeah. Seventy three was the last acceptable year for a muscle car. Yeah. Weird. It is weird. He tried to sell someone a 75 muscle card. Good luck. I'll tell you what, I do have jail shit away from me. Nobody wants it. I loved the 78 Trans six point

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       six. The Burmese. That's a true. That's true. That's true. That's the only car though in the seventies. The Burt Reynolds is that website I bought. This is where I'm. I bought my corvette. Oh my God. Look at that. Sixty eight. Fort Shelby right there. The Lord. What are there? You got 69 in the middle. They're black like in that one there. One hundred 9,000. See, I like my car stock that I don't like when they're all phased out. I don't dare you get a new car for that. Those stock ones drive like shit though. I know, but you just have it for the burger that for 2017. That's what it see where it says pro touring. Those pro touring cars with. That means they take an old muscle car and they put the most modern suspension on it. Like chip foose, red handle. We'll chip is more of a designer and you know, chip does a lot of different modifications to cars to make them look cool. Look at that. 70 Chevelle super sport.

Speaker 3:          00:57:18       Convertible debt. Get Cocker, scrolled down. This 70 Chevelle convertible more. That makes my dick look at that. Look at that fucking car and the restart. Oh my God. Look it. Eight hood. That's my favorite hood. That fucking car. Can we see the interior? Like lease console? That's like a perfect combination to have the wheels. The wheels are like they're modern wheels. A vintage Erin. The radio is dope. Like at the top aunt. Then I look at that top. Will leak after data away. He stayed down. No, no, it won't leak because these are all new that everything's new and used cars. Wow. Look at that. God. The console with the forest speed. Unbelievable. One hundred 49. That's the fucking car right there. Look at that car. Just gives you a man bone. Gives me a boner for that. Even for sex though. No, no, I got. So you just want to try. Just drive around hard trunk. This was the last uh, last couple of years of the Chevelle to let's just Chavela was bad ass and 67 and 68. I just wonder what the carbon fibers valve covers. See that? Holy Shit. That's a pro. Yeah, it's an ls three. That's a six point two Liter v eight from a corvette. Oh, Joe. Is it hard not to just buy every single car?

Speaker 3:          00:58:45       Yeah, you gotta you gotta be an adult. You pulled out into the store with that. I would just fuck it if you see my corvette. No, my Corbett's coulier Oh, what year? 60 five. 60 five pro touring convertible. The entire suspensions redone. Fully independent function. Silver, silver. But I uh, sent it down to Steve Strope. Steve Strope is this a hot rod builder in California? And I had them change some things on it and approve the suspension. That's the kind like that one right there. The 64. Exactly. Like mine. Oh my dad had 65 solid it when I was born in [inaudible]. 60 six. I got a photo of it. Him and my mom in front of it to the best. I'll send you the photo and you can look at is cool. I'll show. I'll bring that car to the store when it's finished. It's almost done now.

Speaker 3:          00:59:34       I love those. They were called the black widow. The one on the left. The 64 with the. Yeah, there. Go to that one. I love that. I love that car. There's such radical designs or corvette. God, what a car. I'll come. They didn't do that at all. They do sort of. Dude pulled up the 2015 corvette Z. Oh, love it. Check this out because this right now is a new car the corvette has created. That is as fast as a lot of cars that cost a million bucks. Oh yeah. This is an insane car. I mean, you'd probably have to spend a million bucks to beat it at this. Go to the blue. That's the beef. I love the next one over right there. The light bulb got you. Don't like that. Start drinking again. Know it's pretty dope. The actual car itself and the little swatch looks gross.

Speaker 3:          01:00:30       Yeah, yeah, right. Oh yeah. Thomas. But pull up a video of one of these because once you see it in action, that's where it's ridiculous that this is a 600 horsepower race car that you can buy straight from the factory. It's less than $80,000. Yeah, I mean you can get one stripped out for like 80 grand and it'll burry like most really high end sports cars. It's insane. The, the. This is the, this is the race version. You're looking at Jamie, this is the development of the race, the actual race version, a youtube video, and you can see a guy. He's racing one on the garage. Go to jail. Was Raj? Yup. There you go. Right there. Oh, because it'll get us band. Okay. We'll just watch it without showing it to the rest of the world. But these a liquid.

Speaker 3:          01:01:21       Well they. This is the problem with this car though that bums me out, is that they're making this thing with an automatic. The old zero six in the car. One. The only way you could get it was it had to be a stick shift. I left the car. One fucking man. Remember that one day maybe shifting or even a woman. A woman is exciting. They made one like five years ago, [inaudible]. It was blue with the glass top and they only made like 50 of them and that thing was insane. It was like no, been around for a long time. They've made it for a long time, but it was only available in a stick. J Dot Lana would never buy it in anything other than a stick because he's a fucking man. Yeah. He wears jeans. Shirts 2015. Look at him, look at the APP right there.

Speaker 3:          01:02:04       He's got a one style of shirt that he allows himself. Hey guys, let's, uh, don't get it twisted. I don't give a fuck if I get like the guys feel comfortable. My sleeves are rolled up because I work hard at the, at the garage. Do you know it's. Once he stopped, stopped TV. He got rid of that black dot that was in the middle of his head that he started freaking out and he wasn't totally great time. Got Older, but yeah, I'm, I'm doing his show. His show was supposed to have already happened, but that dude rear ended me.

Speaker 2:          01:02:40       He's got a Joe. He's got a 36 knucklehead, which is considered the best harley of all time. I watched the footage of him last week driving it a riding. It all originally never restored it. He found in a barn. Didn't start it for like 20 years and decided, well, let's try that thing out. And he started up and took her for a ride and I lose my mind when I see it. 30 six knuckle. It's a one year motorcycle. Wow. And he has it a CV looking at real quick. Hold on a second

Speaker 3:          01:03:12       while we're still on it. This car is the 1965. And while we're on this video, before we change, this is the 1965 of 2015. I mean this car when, when all said and done and people look back and like the golden era of muscle cars, they came back in a big way like the new mustangs have. You've seen the new shelby? The 2015. I love shelby. Three-Fifty. The GT three slash 50. It's insane. So beautiful car.

Speaker 2:          01:03:39       They were, they were doing the sound of it yesterday on Yahoo. They said it was the best uh, exhaust note ever done. And you listen to it. It needs to go listen to this car.

Speaker 3:          01:03:49       Let's pull that up. Shelby gt three slash 15 slash 2015. It's incredible. Have 16 because it's not, it's not released. It's not yet. Yeah. Have you seen the 2015 sienna, Toyota, Sienna? No. Pull up the exhausts. Just heard. It's. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:04:04       it's good. They call it the greatest. Wouldn't be November 17th because he said it just came out and that was yesterday. I'm like, yeah, no.

Speaker 3:          01:04:13       Yeah, try Yahoo. Is that it? Noise regulations in America since for was not able to make the gt through screaming at the top of that. We'll try that. Yeah. Let's take out. What does that say exhausts us? Nodes. You can change it.

Speaker 7:          01:04:32       That they, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:04:35       the set here. Let's hear. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:04:38       It was such losers. Yeah. That sounds like a drag when you open up the scanner. Wow. That's a muscle man. That's one of the greatest sounds of muscle cars ever made. Women. That's a god Damn Dragon. It's a dragon.

Speaker 4:          01:05:31       It's glorious. Oh my God. Gloria sounds. Don't get better than that. It's so great, man. That's rock and roll and I'm pretty sure they only make that one in a stick shift. Praise Allah. Praise. Praise store. She can't be making that fucking thing in an automatic to stop. Learn how to drive a stick. You don't appreciate what the fuck you're doing. La Mans Talk. It is this tall. I've never driven a stick. It's not as fun. In bumper to bumper traffic, bumper to bumper traffic sucks. No matter what you do. If you only gonna have one car that you drive around and you want total convenience. Yes, automatic. But if you want to be a fucking man, okay, you gave yourself a goddamn stick shift and you deal with it. You deal with that bumper to bumper in San Fran, man, for you. Just hills on the hills.

Speaker 4:          01:06:22       He is learned. Steve Mcqueen a few times, just drunk jumping hills. Hey, I was in echo park last week. They got hills over there. I've never been three streets. They say are the tallest hills in California above San Fran. Really? You can't even see down. I was like, Holy Shit. I was on my bike. I was like, this is scary as shit in echo park, three hills. I've never been there ever. I just. I always find it hilarious when you see those houses in San Francisco that literally have to be smushed up next to each other because they're both leaning sideways on this fucking hill trying to stay straight, connected each other and like the hill is, and then the bottom of the houses, it's like a triangle to wedge it in as like when you look at the actual frame of the house and the way the foundation is wedged into the hill, you'll like, this is ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          01:07:15       Can you imagine building those crazy like no one's going to buy these and they all sell. And then the other problem is if one of them catches on fire, done, it goes right through all the houses because these fucking assholes are glued next to each other. Yeah, absolutely. Have fires, man. San Francisco has some bad fires. They got a history of it. I mean that 89 earthquake, the entire, uh, marina burned down to the ground because that's, uh, was built on landfill sand. And then the shit start, the earth moved and the house is sunk and the gas lines cracked. And the whole thing went up in flames that took like a day to just put out the fire. So that whole place was burning to the ground. Eighty nine. Imagine what that looked like. A forced CNN. Imagine whole cnn back then they did on the bay bridge over and over when it drops down. And the car falls. Yeah. Yeah. I watched that live from, from Boston. That's where I was like, Fuck California before I moved here.

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       It felt like an actual. It wasn't a quake where you're like, Whoa, this is a big one. It was more like waves. So I can. I was watching the 89 world series. It was giants a's. First time ever. You're like, this could be great. Bay Bay Bridge World series. And I come out in the living room and the fucking four's going like this, like Whoa, what? And then you realize what's going on. I'm

Speaker 3:          01:08:44       scared. Me Too. That shit is real right there. Look at that right there. And then they other mad drove off. So the lady drove off the top of it. Yeah, she was on the top. And then the thing dropped and she went down. I think the other piece crunch people below, you know, a credit spread or you know, somewhere someone skimped on some construction costs. All that is gone now, right? No. The down part is. That's the first part. Oh no, that's gone. Yeah, that's gone. The first part says suspended bridge and the new part, the new parts. Cool. You seen it show the new bridge? No, I don't think so. It's an intention. It's like Super Art Deco. When I lived in San Francisco, I lived there from age seven to 11. I experienced the tiniest little baby earthquake were the windows rattled and I freaked out because it was a little kid.

Speaker 3:          01:09:38       He was there as a kid from seven to 11. Oh, that's right. What were your parents down there? My Dad was. My stepdad when I was a kid was a computer programmer and then you want to be an architect. So we moved from New Jersey to California and lived in San Francisco. Wow. For those five years. And um, when, uh, when I was here I was always scared of it. But that one little one, it was just a little baby one just north of route on the windows and I remember like, Whoa, just this feeling of helplessness and weirdness and then I didn't experience an actual one and even that was a baby one until 94. I was here after the big earthquake and experienced some aftershocks where I was in a shitty apartment in north Hollywood. And I remember the feeling that, you know, those refrigerator boxes, like someone will buy a refrigerator and then the kids would play in the box and so on.

Speaker 3:          01:10:28       But you know how the box like it would. Oh yeah, it would just move like really weekly. You could push it back and forth. That's what the department felt like. It felt like a refrigerator box. I was like, this is crazy because I was in north Hollywood, which isn't too far from North Ridge. That was the epicenter, right? Yeah. And uh, this shitty apartment that I was in was just made out a fucking hopes and dreams and sliding back and forth. And then I've experienced a couple that are similar to that, like five and a half, five point four years, something like that. But I've never experienced a real one. The real ones are supposed to be life changing. Do you see that movie yet? I saw it. I love the Rock, but I'm not going to go. Life is precious that they're trying to limit my movie. Going to movies that don't suck. That's not taking over yesterday's. Would you say that

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       the one about Brian Wilson, that beach boys one. What is it? What's it called? It's called love and mercy. And it's a, the kid from the um, there will be blood and little Miss Sunshine. The guy that didn't talk on that movie, he plays Brian Wilson and it's about the era of a smile and pet sounds. It's so cool. Smile and pet care to pet sounds was the record that the Beatles said, oh my God, we've got to make sergeant peppers will. Yeah. Because it was like, it was a one man genius. Basically heard all these sounds and his fucking head and made this record. Pet sounds. And a beach boys record after they're like, oh, we're so they get into this like dark crazy record one guy. Yeah. I never knew that they need a guy, Brian Wilson. He goes his vision. Yeah. And the other guys were out on tour and he is like, you guys gone on tour and I'll just make a record when you come back, you'll sing on it. And he just made this fucking like legendary record of layered sounds and instruments and, and uh, insane. It's really insane. What should we listen to? Like what song? Oh, let me see the track listing rally. Um, it's, you know that. Oh God only knows right there. That's the one right there. That's really the one they, they, uh,

Speaker 9:          01:12:43       is that right there? That's. God only knows. Yeah. So you can see where beetles get started to pepperdine. Wow. This is the beach boys. It's arguably one of the top five albums of all time. He took acid and, and he starts taking acid. Why have I never heard of this? It's incredible Jeff. That's cool. It's so weird. Yeah. You might not like with either. Probably not going to like this. Let's.

Speaker 2:          01:13:18       Anyway, those guys gave me a copy of the jets. Great.

Speaker 4:          01:13:22       60 six. Huh? Give me a copy. What do you live in the eighties? How are you going to give it to every quarter to just set duel Deborah Shit. I can get it through the air on my own. I need you to give me something that I'm going to lose. Is downloaded the whole album. Right? What am I going to do with that? Once I get it, I haven't stuck a fucking CD in my car and ages. This is a DVD for my kids. That's the only time.

Speaker 2:          01:13:54       Hard disks anymore for my kids. I'm like, I'm that guy that needs the product and like I feel like the man, they're ripping me off. I got to have the heart. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:14:02       Product. Do you have an album that you used to roll joints in? People used to roll joints.

Speaker 2:          01:14:09       This is separate. The seeds. They have sleeves that were a look like acid paper and like rolling. You can rolling paper. Which band came with Chung? Big Bamboo record came with a giant one and everybody world. The big one pounder joint with it. That's hilarious. Great. Yeah. They used to have seeds and we'd. Oh God, it would pop. It'd be smoking. There we go. Pop. And it would stick. And you go fucking seeds.

Speaker 1:          01:14:36       Yeah man. You'd have to like sort it out. Like I remember guys had have to sort out. You'd break it up and then you would be doing all this sorting before you rolled a joint and you throw it in your backyard and go, well good luck on that. Didn't go anywhere. Right? Well there was all kinds of different ways that you would get seeds with. And then it wasn't until like, I don't know, when did they start having no seeds? I came along to we'd late,

Speaker 2:          01:15:03       I think that has seats. I've always, always Mexican brick weed for me. Press it all together. And so it come in this brick, you'd have stems and seeds and you break it apart and then uh, you know, roll it up. But once that indycar like up and uh, you know, nor cal, when they started growing that kill or those cola buds, there was no seeds and that shit, it was just giant Koala buds and everybody's like, Whoa, indicus here. The new weed off

Speaker 1:          01:15:32       we'll out of figure out was how to genetically like not engineer with like chemicals, but splicing and using. Once those gaps, those botanists got ahold of weed. That's when Shit got interesting. All they needed was just enough comfortable space where they didn't feel like they were gonna go to jail. Just give them enough. So Humboldt was like, where a lot of that stuff came from because like that whole economy up there is based on weed.

Speaker 2:          01:15:54       Oh, tell her I say the Emerald Triangle documentary. It's unbelievable. I haven't seen it, but I know a lot of people grow up there. Yeah, me too. And it's like without that, that, that whole area has gone.

Speaker 1:          01:16:05       Yeah. That's what's weird because logging went away and a lot of those guys actually voted against legalization, which is really fucked up. Yeah. Because they want the money. They would butcher the prices. And uh, if it was, it was easy, you know, if it was easy to grow and nobody had ever run any risk, then it wouldn't be worth it. They're out of business. It's not fucked. Pat Is fucked. They also voted against like the one of the doctors that I've been to for recommendations for prescriptions, he told me that like, he's like, quite honestly, I know doctors that are voting against legalization because they want to keep it medical because you've got to keep going to the doctor every year and pay a fee in order to get your license renewed. And I'm just like, Whoa, it's all money. Think of that. I go, that's fucked. I got money. I go, how does that make you feel? And he's like, well, I feel like I have to adjust my business. But the right thing to do is to vote for legalization. I'm like, that's what he says, that's going to immediately go out and vote no. Be on Dr Phil the next day with a tie.

Speaker 2:          01:17:04       I want to get high and to get right now. No, no. I'm on my bike. No,

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       ain't no fucking motorcycle. Have a navigation system on your motorcycle? Uh, well I can run it through my phone. That's cool. Yeah. I see those things on the new Harley commercials with the other navigation screen or like this is nuts. Like they have, they have, but I feel like a motorcycle should be a motorcycle. You feel like you should see fucking gauge cluster. And that's it. That's what I got. When I see the phone ringing, it's Bluetooth into your motorcycle. I'm like, Ooh, I got Kinda. It's, I get it. I get that. That's convenient. But she seems weird that in the helmet, like Stereo. So you just turned on like 10 and you're. And you're just blasting Zeplin. Oh, you've seen this heads up display that's going to go right into your eye. That will gouge out your brain. That's a stupid one. There's a better one where it's up in here.

Speaker 4:          01:18:02       It's just like right here and you don't see it and you can see behind you. That is a big risk that guys. Kate, take a, putting that metal square by inches from his eyes that that's stupid. Knowing that he's going to be crashing that bike, the great likelihood at least once in his life. Have you had a bad crash thing? It's so funny, man. I always talk about people like there's two things I hate when you're riding the one guy that comes up and we got you crashed yet. Which if you did, you don't want to relive it with a stranger. You know what I mean? Like, yeah, let me just tell you about how bad I crashed. I've been trying to forget it and the other one is I had one of those. They always tell you they had some year they had and they didn't have it in l and it sell it. Got, you know, wife had the kids. It's just like those are the two things I hate, but no, never crashed.

Speaker 4:          01:18:57       Those poor bastards. Look at you and get you out there and living the dream. When I used to live the dream, I used to go out there and risking at feeding off the adrenaline ticket chances, cutting lanes. I had some friends from Canada, from Alberta, and they had never been to California before and they didn't know that you were allowed to cut lanes and so these people would drive. They're like, what the fuck is going on? These people are mania. They're flying by him with the highway. They were freaking out because you can't do that in Canada state. It's a really new, believe it only state is it really the own fucking statement. And they just pat where he passed it like two weeks ago. That's so crazy. I can't believe it. It's such a bad law. So horrible. It sucked. Um, especially with people texting. Oh, I get it for them. It's awesome. You're stuck on the four or five. Everybody else is dead and you're moving. That is awesome. I totally get it from their point of view, but from a safety point of view, how the fuck. First of all, why do I have to wear a seatbelt if this dude doesn't even have a fucking shell on? He's on a bike. I have to have a seatbelt. This fucking guy is even surrounded by anything. They just did a study

Speaker 2:          01:20:09       for two years straight and fanned out. Splitting lanes is safer than sitting in traffic because the texters are crashing into dudes. That's true. They're just like texting and boom. They hit the guy on the bike and it's also not illegal to do it in shorts. How that's the dumbest fucking thing. When you see people with a short sleeve shirt on or no sleeves in shorts, like how come I have to wear a seatbelt or I'll tell you what. You want to Google a man rides motorcycle thongs. It'll fucking make you throw up. I don't need. I see guys in thongs around La riding scooters. So just hoping you talk about them. You're talking about them on a podcast. I'll look at their feet. Their feet are bad. Google it, man. I get broken off. Oh yeah. When they crashed the concrete there. Barefoot, barefoot. Equal concrete.

Speaker 2:          01:21:04       Sixty, barefoot plus concrete. Ooh, Jesus Christ. That's a mess. That's ugly. That's. You'd never walk right again. It's so. Grow into the rainbow with your fucking dean always makes me nervous. So he, like, he, he, he, because he drives his motorcycle to like San Diego or Arizona and stuff like that. In that one, like recently there was like that big storm and the whole time you're coming back driving through like rain. That was, how do you drive through that? Can you even see or he hit one puddle, wouldn't you just spin out? Well, I'm not stupid like, but that got caught. I was uh, I ride everywhere. I have no car, so I've done all my spots on motorcycles. So I go to San Diego and I'm doing the weekend and it Saturday night I usually leave Saturday night after the three day weekend, a ride home, but it was rain and I go to sleep and wake up.

Speaker 2:          01:21:57       The next day I wake up, it looks pretty clear. Hey, get on the bike. And as soon as I get out of San Diego by the checkpoint there it starts fucking pouring man like I hadn't seen in La and years. And I'm like, well this is it man. I got a windshield, you know? And I just, I just go because it's one of those things where you're broke so you go, well do I spend money on a motel six here on the side of the highway or just try to make it. And I rolled with, it took me about three hours and it was funny, right when I got to Disneyland it totally stopped raining and by the time I was home I was completely dry. Really? Yeah. Because it was like sun out and you know there's another 40 minutes on the bike and the sun even bad.

Speaker 2:          01:22:45       No, it's not that bad. But it seems like that drive in the rain is probably really fucking hard to see. Right. It's hard to see in. It's super nerve racking because the trucks are sprain. Big Spray. It's the trucks, the 18 wheelers that are on the five, they're spraying big time and you're like, Whoa, fuck. So you're just trying to go wake far out to the left. Them. It's potential wiping out. Must be really fucking keeping your, your senses on the edge. Huh? Brutal. Joe. I'll tell you one time I had to, I had to do this Gig in Bakersfield, uh, like two years in and I was like, I can't cancel. They won't ever booked me again. And I wrote up the five, the grapevine. It got to the top. It was snowing like a light snow. Oh No. My thumb, my right thumb was frozen to where I was like, I couldn't get it anywhere.

Speaker 2:          01:23:37       Like my thumb was numb. It was like, you've frozen barehanded. No, I got gloves, but you're going and your hand is tucked here so you're cool. But the thumb was out like this and I was going to fuck my right thumb is frozen man. I don't feel it's. I pull up in a truck stop and I was drinking hot chocolates and I bought some kids mittens and put them underneath my glove. So I put these mittens on and then my gloves and I get to the Gig and there's like nine people there. Nine people at a bar gig risked your life. I know. I was like, what the fuck? I was so mad. And then I did 15 minutes and turned around and rode home. Oh my God fucked. He also told me something. I didn't know that when people flick cigarettes out there that it actually sometimes gets into motorcycles, like coats.

Speaker 2:          01:24:26       It had one go down my shirt. I almost crashed these people, they flick cigarettes out all day long, all fucking day long. And they don't even care. Just boom. One went down my shirt and I was riding going, oh fuck. Oh. And I couldn't get over because I was in traffic. And I was like, what the fight? It's just burning me s on my chest. He just sent like a man and just touch. I got it out of your chest. I got over. Fucking madness. Can understand. I scream at people, man, you know, my buddy got hit two dragonflies. Fucking we're going around a turn 90. They were stacked on top each other. We're riding like CHP style, mma next to each other. We go around a turn and I see him. His arm flies off his fucking handlebar and he's like, well, and the bite, I go, well this guy is going down. What happened, I thought he was having a heart attack because guys have heart attacks and strokes and shit. I look in my rear view mirror and I've gone and he's pulled over. His face is split open because he got cut from hitting these things that like 90 and they were two dragonflies or like just like sandpaper that hit him in the face and he's like, dude, I almost die. Two dragonflies. Fucking.

Speaker 2:          01:25:47       That's why you have to have goggles. I wear a full face. I don't fuck around and that's why some people don't. They have those little skullcaps on sunglasses. Dumb a bro. I'm a rebel. Some people ride around with no helmets and other states. So you get to Arizona doing

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       comedy and Arizona. Everyone's riding route. Sure. Fuck. Is there a seatbelt law in Arizona? Yeah. Plus plus motorcycles. How Arizona is a state. It's one of those people don't think of it. You think of it as like white people and like you think of it as like Arizona's like golfers or something like that. A lot of people think of it as a Scottsdale. Yeah, Tucson or a tempe rather like real nice, cute. But no, a big part of Arizona is the wild fucking west guns anywhere concealed carry. Like I had a friend, uh, who, uh, he has a lot of guns and he got pulled over in Arizona and he had to tell the cop that he has guns in the trunk and the guy, the cops, like, wow, what do you shoot? And they started having a fucking cool gun conversation. The guy. Well I just let me check real quick, make sure everything's in order and everything was in order.

Speaker 3:          01:26:56       All right man, we'll take it easy. Enjoy your second amendment rights. That fucking pound knuckles and go about their business to gun nuts. We just met on the tarmac out there. I've seen it. A restaurant, please check your gun in Arizona. They had like a fucking wall where you check your guns in some Wyatt earp type shit. You know you got any guns? Fuck yeah. Yeah. I've got a few of those nine millimeters. Yeah, that's the gunman. Nine millimeters. Why do you like them? Just like the shape, the sound, the bullet, everything about it, man. It's. And it's not too big. It's not too small. Know it just fires. As far as handguns go, it's very easy gun to shoot at. I have a glock nine millimeter shoots like it's. It doesn't like. No, it doesn't. Like I have a rifle, the seven millimeter remington ultra mag.

Speaker 3:          01:27:42       I have a 300 win mag, two big kicking fucking elephant killing guns. Bone digs into your shoulder like this. It just is such a difference between a rifle and a pistol. Pistols like feel so small. Like I feel like like if you were hunting with a rifle, like sometimes people hunt with pistols. If you're hunting with a rifle and you hit something that thing's dead. If you you're hunting with a pistol and he hit something like, Ooh, they might survive the shoot. An elk with a nine millimeter and my runaway hooker guns, they keep in their bra. You ever. I love the Desert Eagle. 50 caliber. Ridiculous gun you ever will see the footage girls shooting the Desert Eagle. That is so good. Boom, right into her hand was one, two or girls shooting and her, her tits are exploding like as she shooting like the recoils like boom or taste like sugar. But yeah, I've seen the girl hit herself in the head guy that video. There's videos that late night. You'll just get on and just start fucking laughing your head off. That person's rude. Whoever gave that girl that gun. What the fuck was going to happen in your hand? It's a canon. We shot one of those. Remember Brian when we filmed my comedy special down in Tempe in 2005, we went to the, uh, what was it like the Phoenix

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       gun club or someplace? Gun Club? Wherever they. Yeah, we shot everything. Machine guns. We Shot Desert Eagles. Oh, 44 mag dms. We search out these ridiculous pistols. They throw your hand back. You literally can't hold it straight. You can't know. And the fire that comes out of it is unbelievable. I grew up in the bay area and I just love dirty Harry. I loved it. I loved those films and I just loved him just to Canon like he represented a weird part of San Francisco and that wasn't represented anywhere else in the world. Everybody has thought about San Francisco. They thought about gay people. That was it. San Francisco was gay people and hippies and all of a sudden, wait a minute, what is this guy doing here? And he was a northern California guy. I mean he was mayor of Carmel. Yeah, I know, right? Even nuts. Yeah. Unbelievable runs for mayor wins. Marries the local news caster. He did? Yeah. The chick was. Yeah. They recently got divorced as like all kinds of evil going on. Who's evil going on? My kid can't catch a break. Just add to what a what a God. The secret was he was gay the whole time. Dirty Harry was actually gay. Yeah. It was like overcompensating big black guy. That's what dirty Harry was really all about. It was all about him. Fighting against is homosexual. Urgent. Sorry. Kill. Lucky.

Speaker 4:          01:30:30       It was a different sort of. Because like San Francisco was never thought of as being like a crime fighting town at all. You know, you think in New York, New York is where all the cop shows where you have a movie like that in San Francisco. It was cool. That guy that was in the first one, he. He plays the a sniper. He's the dude

Speaker 10:         01:30:50       from the warriors come out

Speaker 4:          01:30:54       that guy.

Speaker 4:          01:31:01       Tough Gig for a dude to be that like a character actor, psycho guy. Just be once you're a psycho guide, the fucking leading man roles and no longer available to you. You're a psycho. God. Take the psycho role says it great. You know what I mean? Like I've done a few movies and I'm always like, when? When do I get to kill a guy? You know? I always get killed. It's, you have a weird path in a comedy man. I think that's weird. The weirdest path I've ever heard of being 44 years old and starting standup. Yeah. You had a must. You must have been fucking running like you must have hit the ground running. I never stopped. He kind of had to because like if you're going to really do this, like not a lot of time for people to accept it right now if you're 53 and they're like, oh, he's been doing comedy for eight years, people go, oh, all right. Yeah, but if you're 53 and he just started yelling, Woo, boy, you're on your way to 60 before your seven years in La. It's pretty wild, you know, but I'll tell you what, it saved my life. Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       I was pretty, you know, when you're 44, your friends are long gone. Married with kids. Cue The music. Piano, music. It's true though.

Speaker 1:          01:32:18       Oh, I know what you mean. Like in your hold out, like you didn't get married. No family.

Speaker 2:          01:32:22       Right? Right. So you, did you wonder about that, about family? Did you wonder what it was like? No, I had one great girlfriend lost her because of rock and roll and she raised the bar too high. What was the bar like? Just I'm saying she was a great girlfriend, like seven years of rock and roll. Yeah. Just, you know, just rock. Just rock. Because the one that got away. Yeah, she is the one that got check in with her every now and again. I tried it. She doesn't have anything for it. I did Davies Symphony Hall two weeks ago in San Fran with Marin and I was like, come down to the shell and just nothing to no man, but I know she got. Nah, she doesn't. She never got married either. Maybe I raised her par. Maybe you did. Maybe you just need to get together with her. Maybe I've tried it with a bow tie and a bouquet of flowers. Ty. Come on like a wacky weather guy. You know what I love. What I do better though is like I did some movies and stuff and she didn't go like, oh, he must be getting famous. I'm getting back. You know what I mean? She didn't do that. That was cool. Let's be honest. We really didn't get famous but a person that's normal

Speaker 1:          01:33:37       did. You really did. Maybe then she would, you know, maybe then to like, hmm.

Speaker 2:          01:33:42       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:33:44       okay, one more chance. But if you sell us out for rock and roll again, what was it about rock and roll? It was just the hours being on the road.

Speaker 2:          01:33:55       Yeah, it's that. It's. It's just like comedy. I could never have a girlfriend now it's I, I, I dedicate myself 100 percent. I'm out seven nights a week. I don't miss a night. I can't wait. Am I going to do. Unless they're in the Biz and work and then we can hang during the day.

Speaker 1:          01:34:11       Yeah. It's hard for people to win. The worst thing is when a guy's talented comic and he gets a girlfriend and she doesn't like the lifestyle, and then he shifts. I seen it. I've seen it happen too. And then you run into those guys 10 years later when the girl had broken up, but they want to try all over again. It's ugly. It's like, dude, you missed. You missed the whole thing. Like you're not a pro. Now you try to. You do you want to become a pro again? Me had you had a chance at one point in time, but now you're fucked.

Speaker 2:          01:34:37       Yeah. Yeah. I never wanted to hear this. Are you going to go out and again tonight? So I get every night, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:34:46       Yeah. And the ceiling, especially at 44 starting when you really got to commit, you've got to hit the ground running. You can't take a few slow years and half asset and kind of get back in.

Speaker 2:          01:34:57       No Way, man.

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       Once I started I was like, Whoa, this is hard. Was it scary being 44 and like beginning a new chapter in your life like that? Or was it exciting? It was. It wasn't scary as far. I loved it. I was like, Oh, I'm back on stage. Oh Shit. And I'm doing this, but the survival mode is brutal. You know, it costs a fortune. I'm 40, $49, what am I going to do? Live with nine dudes, you know? Hey, my rent's 300 p like the older brother that gives advice to the young crazy kids. This is not how you do ketamine boys. You gotta be careful. You can't intramuscularly shoot without having alcohol on hand. Don't know what the fuck you're doing. This isn't sterile. Yeah, you know it, it's just, I just didn't think it was going to be a, I was going to work this hard, like, you know, I was like, Oh fuck, I'm working hard, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:35:52       Well, what did you think? You think it would be easy? It did it look easy from the outside, like you seen people crack jokes. I never thought it was going to be easy ever, but I didn't think it was going to grab me like it did. I thought, Oh yeah, I'll go down and try it. And then I started doing it and it grabbed me and it took over my life in a good way and I was like, wow man. I mean I literally work all day every day. I don't take a day off. What do you mean by all day? Everyday? Like what do you do? Well, I podcast five days a week, five days a week while I grabbed guests, want home and bank them. And then I, uh, I'm always auditioning. Then I write all, all day, like from the sets. I listened to the sets and I take notes and then I go, right now I'm, I'm cohost and Tom Green's TV show when he's on the road, I guess tell us.

Speaker 1:          01:36:40       So there's no days off at none. How did you, uh, when did you start doing this? Tom? Green thing I love is that he's doing it still out of his house, right? Oh, he moved it. He got a warehouse, uh, in, in the valley and took all that stuff and moved it to his house and it's about a month old. I've been doing it for about a month now and it's so great man, because it's a TV show and so he does it on a regular basis. So you have to guest host. It's sorta like when Johnny Carson has the same thing, he goes on the road and then a producer sometimes got three guys. Yeah, it's great. And I, I've had some really cool guests. Had Mike Beach who's been an actor for a 35 years. He was on sunset marquis for six seasons. He played Tio, the black gang leader of a grim.

Speaker 1:          01:37:29       A bastards is also an er. Had him on, at Madonna's guitar player, they just slept for tour, a Monte Pittman on and uh, and then I had a guy Shawn Carrigan from a young and the restless, so I have different kinds of guests and it's cool. And then we'd take skype calls and uh, and regular calls. It's when I first did tom shows like when the first time Brian and I had thought about doing something and then when he had that set up in living room where he was like, it was crazy. He had his own server room with all these server set up and these crazy fucking lines. And we were trying to figure out like, like Brian, first of all, one of the thing for Brunswick, you don't need all of this.

Speaker 1:          01:38:12       Essentially. He was like his own aol. We were like, what is going on here? It seems like. Yeah. And they were doing it with a company out of Denver, you remember? And the company out of Denver wanted to do something with me and we talked about it, but I was like, wait a minute, what? What exactly are you doing? Like, how are you doing this like this and that's why we started fucking around with Justin Dot TV too. And uh, we had thought about doing some other sort of streaming version of one of these things, but Tom Green had gone balls out from the jump. It was a TV show in his house and his house, his whole house, this house was abandoned essentially. He just had a kitchen and a bedroom hit a giant server room. He had these wires all throughout the middle of his house. He's fat fucking cables that were laid down everywhere. You have to step over them.

Speaker 2:          01:38:58       So he's got all that stuff. I love Tom Green because he represents what I've have. He's like, you, he's a self made, you know what I mean? Like he doesn't wait for people to come to him. He just does it since he was like 16, you know, he had a show on public access and Canada. Then he lands on MTV. Then he starts doing his own show, you know, it's like pre jack ass and shit.

Speaker 1:          01:39:22       Well he's at his best to when he's doing his own thing. And when I think his, his career experience like a wall, it was because he was doing a bunch of other people's Shit. He was doing movies he was doing. And you, when you start doing that, you get involved with all these different producers and different network people and different executives and different people have different idea of how your thing should go because they're investing money in it and they have say they can green light things are shut things down and you can't have a guy like that land to that kind of constraints because you're never going to get a Tom Green. Yeah. You get the Tom Green that showed up on MTV, the Tom Green that was doing that cable access show. These just a maniac. Just let that guy beat that. Yeah, totally. Totally.

Speaker 2:          01:40:04       And that's what he does. And a lot of people, they way they're like, I hear this a lot. They go, yeah, I got no agent or manager. It's like, get me either. You just fucking go do it. Man.

Speaker 1:          01:40:15       In this day and age is less less important than it's ever been. Totally less important than it's ever been is changing on a daily basis. On a daily basis. You're getting more and more of these social media apps. That's us. Bam. That's cool. That's cool. Yeah. That's, uh, that was, uh, we were sitting in this place where we're like, this is cool. This whole thing is pretty, pretty dope. You could drink. Were taking calls. I was like, ah, I love it. He had all those pencils. I don't know why

Speaker 2:          01:40:44       I've got it. Set Net. Dean del Ray. Look at it now, man. It's crazy. Is it different? Oh yeah. Last same place. Uh, he moved, he got a warehouse. He moved all the stuff

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       out of his house because he was just like, I can't have these people in my house anymore. So chuck is set up now. It's unbelievable. He's also been doing a lot of periscoping. Him and Andy Dick. I mean Andy Dick Pretty much lives on periscope now. It's really weird seeing them on it. But we ran into him the other day at the comedy store, periscoping, periscope at each other. I was periscoping him, periscope and me double what I meant tonight as it the same set that he just moved to a warehouse and this. Check it out. There it is. Look, so he's got. Just fast forward a little bit. This is supposed to be him. Yeah. Yeah, but look, man, it's a story. Eric Griffin. I know the dude. It's a straight up talk show inside a full warehouse. Here's, here's the problem with that is the worst dumb fucking way to sit down when you're talking to somebody. Why are you above him? Yeah. Know Eric's taller than you.

Speaker 3:          01:41:46       And second of all, why? Why would you sit like that while he sits sideways? I. that's so retarded. Podcasts on the way to talk. This is good. You look at me. We're right here. There's not one person like people got mad at me when I had this special ergonomic chair. It was like taller, so I got all these tweets like trying to psychologically have an up try to psychologically be above your gross. I'm way taller than you have to be above. You'd look down upon you. Letterman's a tall dude anyway, and then on top of that, his desk is tall. Yeah, he's very tall. Oh yeah. And on top of that, his desk is taller. That's odd approach, but that's how everybody always did it. Was that sideways desk, the Johnny Carson style desk. Why? What did, what are you writing books? What's the desk? Why do you have a fucking desk to talk to people?

Speaker 3:          01:42:36       You need a desk that seems retarded, but it's like the guy was a school teacher or something. I mean that's how we looked at it. A fucking desk and everyone's so on. Original people are just such copycats that everybody. Craig Ferguson, everybody, Jimmy Kimmel, everybody just copies the original Johnny Carson up, which is one of the worst formats that were for communicating with people. The only thing it does is establish that one person is in control of the situation. The Guy Behind the desk, that's the captain, and so you'll be right back. You know, he could be right back quicker than if just like all bunch of dudes sitting around a circle with the chairs the same height and in the same style. And just then it'd be a little weird, like, why is Dean that the head? Why doesn't Tom Green get to decide when they go? You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          01:43:21       That's why I think Joan rivers had it best. She had it in bed, which is the most comfortable. Or just gazing each other's eyes. May touch some feet. Amanda. I didn't get a chance to do that right now. I'm going to add that I really didn't get a chance to meet her either, but I. Bummer. I was booked on that. I was booked on that and something happened. We canceled or some, someone canceled. I don't remember the exact details, but she was an all time great. Oh God. All the time. Great. Ballsy to the end. I mean, just that what she had to put up with when she decided to run show after carson and he just bands

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       her. She could have easily just been buried.

Speaker 1:          01:43:54       You know, son was a douchebag. Oh, you watch the documentary. He had a big dude and he was a big Dick. Both things were different than, man, you can't be that guy today. Nobody would allow it. It would get out that you're that kind of a con shitty to people, but it's also back then you know we talked about this with Howard stern and radio guys is like back then they were all fighting over a time slot and that's kind of stupid

Speaker 2:          01:44:19       time slots are gone now. It's people whenever they're working and listening or working out or commuting or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:44:26       Well because of dvrs and also with these, one of the things that letterman kind of, one of the reasons why he decided to step back was what shows had become mostly is like the show would get a certain amount of views but would really would get a lot of use, would be the clips from the show that would go online and then people will be able to access those whenever they wanted it and that became a big thing and he was missing that. He was like, we're not doing that. Like Jimmy Fallon is doing that Kimmel's doing that. We're not doing that anymore. And he just realized that that the whole genre was kind of passing his style by.

Speaker 2:          01:45:00       Yeah. They're like, Marin was on last week and they made the quip that Marin stops masturbating because it drought because he masturbates in shower and it was a huge clip on youtube. You're instantly going to watch it, you know, because uh, they break it down into the, the meat of the interviews, the funny jokes where you can watch the show kind of in like 15 minutes.

Speaker 1:          01:45:20       Yeah. Like that Louis ck thing. Everything is great and no one's happy. No. The thing about a technology that was on Conan and that became like this huge viral sensation which was way bigger hit than the actual episode itself, which, you know, not that many people watch conan anymore. Yeah, it's pretty low, right? It's very low in comparison to like what the Johnny Carson show used to be at one point in time. There's no show like that where everybody watches the tonight show,

Speaker 2:          01:45:51       a million a night, Carson. And then I guess when he signed off $60 million on the 97. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:45:57       When you get on the tonight show back then they made a star out of you. There's no show like that anymore. That makes someone a star, but if you became a regular in the tonight show and he would sit on the couch next to Johnny, you were in man. You made it. You were royalty. You were. You were adorned, you were knighted. Yeah. Steven, right. I mean it changed his world. Was that Letterman or was that Carson? Carson, Carson. He was asked back the next day because we come back tomorrow and he came back, did another set the next day or whatever, but

Speaker 2:          01:46:28       I. I said this to people all the time. It's, it's bigger to do Rogan, podcast or Marin or say the top five than it is to do it tonight. Show set. Now it is. Yeah, because I go all over and people go, man, I heard you on such and such and it's amazing because people find those podcasts at different times. If

Speaker 4:          01:46:49       you're on TV goes by and if they didn't see it, they didn't see it, but everyday somebody finds an episode. I was on a say this a year from now that I just heard John Rogan man and they discovered on their own timeframe. Well we have it set up the most access possible to. I don't have a subscription based. Some guys like you can get the first episodes like Marin has that right? Yeah, the backlog, first 50 or free or whatever, and then you buy the backlogs. But I feel like like you fuck yourself when you do that. I feel like the real connection is, is the fact that it's all free. That's a big. That's the, the, the, the easiest. He can get it. Whether it's through stitcher or through youtube or through ustream or Vimeo or whatever the fuck it is. You just gotta be able to get it as easily as possible.

Speaker 4:          01:47:35       And then if people like it, it just spreads the growth we're experiencing because of just word of mouth. We're up 2 million downloads from last month. Wow. 10 million in a month. I call it. It's like an exponential fucking tsunami of madness. It's crazy. I call it the, uh, it's like metallica. It's the old school grassroots. Metallica had a cassette tape, like 40 people got them. Lars sent them two guys. I love Metallica. Send me a tape. They copied those tapes, they send them to their buddies, their buddies copy those tapes. They send them in their bodies in a matter of five years. There's probably $200,000 of those cassettes out grass roots. Tell me. It's not ironic that Lars Ulrich wasn't gonna to take down napster after all that. So Larry, it's like word of mouth and the ability to spread your shit was what made them in the first place and then he's like, hey man, we want that money.

Speaker 4:          01:48:31       That money. Napster should have used Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Instead. They gave a vhs. They made a vhs tape as a little Christmas gift. It was like a 10 minute thing and then that spread through Hollywood over night. I saw it. I saw it back then before the show was on. Yes, I did. That was the Brian Boitano one. Oh my God. It was God damn genius. Well, Brian Boitano do. Alls I'm saying is metal people, the way they spread stuff are like what? Pod comedy podcasts people are. It's great. They're like, man, did you hear this show? I think one of the best things about comedy podcast is unlike what happened with Johnny Carson and Joan rivers, podcasts was all support other podcasts, so it seems to be across the board. I haven't seen any beef where podcasts are saying, hey, if you do Adam Carolla show, you can't do my show.

Speaker 4:          01:49:15       No one does that. No, that was the model. That was the model. They all did it. They all did totally. They all fucked each other because of that and because they were fighting over these time slots and everyone had this famine theory going on where if you weren't number one, you were below number one and if you were losing, if you're in second place, he made less money and everyone's panicking so they had these politics are playing back and forth like that. Remember that movie that they is correct. Jay Leno, David Letterman and the late night wars and that. Doesn't NBC do that right now with like fallon or somebody like

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       that? If you do found you can't do camel or something, you can do family. They probably have laws like that. You know, they probably. I mean, some people could probably do whatever the fuck they want, but they probably have laws like that or unwritten rules didn't. There you go. I do them all and they go, that's fine. We just want to narrow. It's a stupid model. You have to be tuned in by 11:00. That's when it starts and it ends at 1:30. Why? Just show it all the time. Have it available whenever anybody wants to watch it, then it will be better. It's like this model of like tuning in for something and waiting for it. Like that's why I love Netflix. Netflix takes a season and they go a season. Three of the orange is the new black is out. Good luck. Then you get all the fucking episodes.

Speaker 3:          01:50:34       The whole season is out in one fell swoop that benchwatch, which I love to do in a hotel somewhere on the road to best tap. If you get ahold of a fucking series and you find out about it and you find out about it like after five seasons already done. Oh, I didn't find out about game of thrones until I think the second season. So I watched the whole first season and then deep and when I caught up I was sad that we week. That was me with breaking bad three seasons straight. I got the flu, the flu. It's still dark. You're feeling shitty.

Speaker 3:          01:51:13       I watched all three and then I was like, wait, now I've got a wait. Oh fuck. Yeah. I think that that's the future is going to be. We're going to laugh one day thinking about the idea of tuning into a special time to watch a show like, well not like a world premiere. APM shouldn't ever eat your popcorn once you've had it for hours uploaded, uploaded. So I can get it whenever on demand is the future 100 percent. Oh yeah. Everything else is stupid. It really is the idea of like tuning in, like I guess maybe new shows with that exception because the end of the day you do want to kind of find him. What the fuck is going on the world even though shows man, they're getting trounced by like the young Turks and all these online shows that can do whatever they want.

Speaker 3:          01:51:57       Well, twitter, as far as schools, you find out news immediately. Instantly. Yeah. Rip. Someone will tag you. Oh Shit. Yeah, and just the think when periscope does catch on more, it's going to be news, twitter, but video. So like if something's happening in Washington, we could just turn to that exact street for people on periscope right there. We've got four different camera views. Totally right now and that's what it's going to be like. USTREAM did a lot of that during the ferguson riots. Streaming services that do that during the during Baltimore. All that kind of stuff is the future. Oh God. Yeah. Periscope. I mean that is definitely the future man. I was watching somebody last night for an hour. I had no idea who they were. They were just as miscellaneous person in Germany. Just watching them hanging out, which things that we were watching

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       the twitch channel which has all these people playing video games and then you'll, you'll look down and say, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, hold on. That guy's got 10,000 people watching him play a video game. That fucking arena filled with people and you think about if you're performing in front of 10,000 people, you'd be like, Holy Fuck, you reach 10,000 people with your words. That's crazy. Right? Guys playing a video game. Did you read, did you read that article, Joe? Um, which has really hit me big time as a comedian. If you have 1000 true fans, you can survive as an artist. What does that, what are you showing me? I was just showing that the other day on periscope at 10,000 live viewers. You had 10,000 people watching live on periscope live at the same time. I don't know if it's all the same time, but it was 10,000 different people watch and it was just fucking with people.

Speaker 4:          01:53:32       I'm like, wait, I'm sorry, what are you saying? If you have a thousand true fans, what? Yeah, yeah, there's a, there's an article a guy wrote, I read it online about two weeks ago and he said that if you as an artist have 1000 true fans, you could survive a doing art, whatever form of art you do forever. Because he said the 1000 people, which you think, oh, that sounds pretty easy. I'm trying to get 100 right now. This is an incredible article. If you read this, it doesn't matter. Well, we'll get to the end of the long. The long tails of famously good. What? Okay. Just stop. I'm reading. Fuck scrolling. Fuck. The long tail is famously good news for two classes of people. A few lucky aggregators such as Amazon and Netflix and 6 billion consumers of those two. I think it's okay. This is what they said though.

Speaker 4:          01:54:28       Basically as if you have 1000 fans that each spend about $100 a year on your meaning. They bought a DVD, you know, or they bought a ticket, a couple of tickets or they watched your special 100 a year. You got about 100,000 after everything, maybe 50, 60. You could survive. Awesome. On that. Every year. The problem I have is the term true fan, right? I fucking, I don't even like saying fans either. People who, like you say friends, people who like soldiers, what you're doing. I always say, I always tell friends, Maris, I call them my friends because we're. If they're in the stuff I'm. We would be friends. Yeah, if you're doing good shit and people like your good shit and they keep supporting it. When you have a commitment with them, it's kind of cool because it's like you have customers. It's like say if you were like a guy who made great shoes or something and about handmade shoes, you've got a bunch of customers that swear by the Dean del Rey shoe and they buy them whenever they can and it's like if you're doing good work and there they appreciate good work. If you really can nail it and just lock it as a comic, it's a. it's hard. Right? It makes you feel good though. Like they liked my podcast. I get emails at night, man, and they're like, dude, the stuff

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       you're talking about with music, no one likes it. Like me, I feel. And your, you know, they like I can relate man and it's, it feels good.

Speaker 1:          01:55:51       Let there be taught. Because your product, is it mostly about rock and roll or is it all kinds of shit?

Speaker 2:          01:55:55       It's all kinds of shit, but I really a, I have a lot of rock and rollers on and people that I loved in life that have a dna that influenced me, you know, I try to seek them out. Maybe a guy that built choppers, you know, like a or a guy who. An amazing motor builder and then a comedian that blows my mind then a rocker.

Speaker 1:          01:56:17       And if you have the cool thing about what you're doing is you don't have to talk to anybody about what you do. You don't have to like sit down with some guys. Go Dean, I think we're in the wrong direction with this. What we want to do is, first of all, I want to dye your mustache mustache. The young kids today, they can't relate. They, you know, the tattoos are great. But uh, maybe a lip ring.

Speaker 2:          01:56:41       Yeah. They're trying to like get you hip. Yeah. Maybe a teardrop tattoo. Just a little one in the corner. And I look at dudes like you and Marin and, and, and, and those are the dudes and burt and I, just, those are the guys, you know, if you, if you like something, you know, you figure it out. Like these guys are doing it, man, you know, they're doing it and you figure out like, what is my niche? I love music. Let's talk about rock. But I love comedy too. So we got guys on, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:57:14       being yourself, being in yourself. That's the cool thing about podcasts. You can really truly be yourself because you just have a microphone and a camera on you. You don't even have a camera. You just do. It's just audio, right? Audio. Yeah. That, that's just never. There's never been a time where you could do that. There's never been a time we could have your own fucking radio show. It's available instantly. If I drive home right now, I can go into itunes or go into the podcast app or either on my iphone and I just write Dean del Rey and it'll show me the therapy. We talk, boom. And I'll just start streaming it. I'll put my foot down, I put my seat, my phone down on a seat at a red light. During that red light. I picked up your podcast and I'm listening to it now. That's insane. Or I could say it. I mean those fucking who say Dean del Rey and they'll put it up in a search. It's amazing how accurate that thing. It's crazy. It's crazy. What's a weird time to be alive with the whole shit?

Speaker 2:          01:58:08       I was. I was lucky too that I figured out how to do it on my own. You know, like I was looking at Brian. I went on the road with Brian last year and this fucking guy works his ass off. We're out on the road. How dare you lie to America knows him way more than you did when we were out on the road. He was working his ass off. He had the shows booked. He had the hotel's booked, he had the car rental car, he had the flights and we're cruising around and I was like, is a self made, you know, machine here, the desk squad.

Speaker 1:          01:58:38       You have to figure out a way to do your own in this day and age

Speaker 3:          01:58:41       because if you, if you do bring other people in, especially in the beginning, you're going to have to give them a cut of almost nothing. So like as you're hustling and you're trying to put together these shows, if you're given a manager 15 percent of that or an agent, 10 percent, 25 percent is gone. Then you have to pay taxes. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:59:00       Anyway, it sucks is when you're on the road with somebody, it does have a manager and then they still get your 10 percent. Like, I don't want to say who, but like I like got checks because I was on the road and their manager took my. Took 10 percent of the mic and I'm like, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute. When we talk a lot, you got robbed. You don't have a contract with someone. And they took 10 percent of your check. Who the fuck is this? Nothing. Fuck did that. Somebody robbed. I know that. So it's weird, but I can tell you that it's going to get a certain amount and then they took them out. Brian opened up the can. Someone's robbing? No, not that I know, but uh, but with working with like Dean [inaudible], the Dean doesn't have it. Let's have a fake name. Let's use a fake name. Rhymes with. Fuck man, that's gross. That's someone's stealing money. That's, you know, it's just weird that managers even do that. So damaging you. If he's not managing judging

Speaker 3:          02:00:05       you like a manager, here's a person that Gig. Where's your cut as well? Well, here's the deal though. What is this? What I'm saying is, as a manager, a manager is a longterm commitment. I've had the same manager since I was an open mic or most comedians try to keep it manager for a long time and the agent is someone who works with you guys but is not as close as the manager. The manager's supposed to be the person that's like looking over your career in an advisory position and like no one's advising you because not advising you go on periscope now. I really think it'll help because he's not advising you at all. She's taking 10 percent. For what reason? Say stuck in a Gig. I guess you got to get that money back. Dude. Take time. We're going to find that money back.

Speaker 3:          02:00:49       One way or another. We had a book, a Gig with this guy and then we'll go steal. Steal that money. Damn it. Sorry. Jacob Dylan loves you, man. I wanted to tell you that he still remembers the time. His kids got to go down to the set of fear factor. He never forgot it. He was like, man, it was so great. My kids just lost their minds. They were in there. The guy's eating eyeballs, you know, five feet away. And He loved it. Man. He's a good guy. He is a great piece of really, really fucking talent singer too. It's just some of my best friends. Is He really? I always wondered why they didn't like take off like those. What was that song? I can remember when one headline that, well they sold. They sold 26 million records. I know, but wow. How come you didn't keep making jams like that? Like what happened? Well, when you have a record

Speaker 12:         02:01:40       that fucking big, it was huge. That is hard to come. You know, people. You're wearing an ACDC hats. So shut your mouth. Shit for me. Come on man. I'm just saying it is hard though. Like some people you know. Here's the example. Deeds. Come on,

Speaker 7:          02:02:09       he's giving you.

Speaker 12:         02:02:12       I love that.

Speaker 7:          02:02:14       Yeah. Want to graduate but not this way. Here's what you gotta do.

Speaker 12:         02:02:19       Get that rock and roll voice. What is that? Oh my God, I forgot about that shit. Stand up so that they can see on the camera. Wow. Who did that? Man? Oh, this guy. Oh yeah, that's bad ass guy named Nikko Hurtado. California guy. Yeah, he worked. He worked on a Kat von D on that TV show a couple of years, but he has his own place out in grass valley and this guy is next level for portraits. He super talented for everything. Super fucking talented. So good man. I went out there 16 hours. That thing ate and ate. That took 16 hours. And this, this rib cage is the worst place ever to get a tattoo. I'm already started. I went, hey, you might want to move to another spot for a few minutes. That's kind of tender. And he's like, yeah, the whole thing's going to be like that as like what? We're only 10 minutes. You're ready to quit? Oh yeah. I will make it a bumblebee. And how much harder is it than your arms? It's so. It's, it's like I can't describe it. It's, it's so bad. It's so bad that I didn't get angus on the other side, which was the original plan.

Speaker 12:         02:03:40       I, I'll probably do it though if you do it, we should film it on periscope, right? Actually, we should have him do it here in the studio with Joey Diaz is getting sponsors on periscope now. There's, they're contacting him because he does. He does the morning joint, gets up in the morning. He lights up a joint and he starts dropping science of motivation. Dog. Good. So for, you know, whatever minutes he, when he gets up and smokes his first joint of the day, he brings people on this ride with them. They call it the morning joint. So he's going to get. You could get a sponsor. You had your tattoo. That'd be great. Right? It might have been paid for the Tattoo man about that. I really want to get the other side done and I want to get the comedy star Logo. Yeah. It's just I needed a new logo a little. No, no, no, no. I love. It was just a big deal to me though. You know what I mean. My name's on the wall and it was just like it was, it was the biggest thing that ever happened to me and I played music and toured with everybody and done all kinds of shit, but that was next level stuff. It's great until you look at some other people to run them

Speaker 11:         02:04:47       wall on fucking second split Gaddy boys. What fucks on that? We'll take some black paint. I sat there the other day and just googled like half the names on the front patio because I was like, what? What's a z cat like, what is Zika? And half of them I don't even think are real. I think literally people like came in there and just know there's a few, like a towing truck company isn't on there. Like how was it? Totally. Yeah. I'll show it to you. It's weird.

Speaker 12:         02:05:18       It's pretty. It's it, it's a big deal. To me though. It's just like from the ground up, I was 44. I just stumbled onto that patio like, Hey, I'm here to do comedy and they're like get the fuck outta here. Don't had fitzsimmons on yesterday. And we were talking about that book about the comedy store. What is it called? What is it? Grow to a comment you don't know standing there or what is it a. what's it called? It's great book, man. I can't believe no one's made that movie, but what he was basically saying was that at those days, what I'm dying up here, he was saying that at the description of what the store was in the seventies is exactly like it was today. Yeah. Like it was like common hanging out in the back patio. People going on stage there. It's amazing.

Speaker 12:         02:06:10       That place is kept that freaky vibe. I did a dollar show last night, the doormen show and the in the belly room on such a good idea for a show to you don't understand how happy it makes all the like the door guys and stuff that worked there because they pretty much used to have two nights of open mic and then they took it away. It's way better for, for the people that work there because that was the only reason why these guys work their work their spot. So the doormen went up, Jeff Ross did some time and I closed it out. I did a half an hour and close it out. It's all sold out. It's only a buck is so cool right there in that room. Own it. Says it says capacity 57. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         02:06:48       Fire Marshal.

Speaker 12:         02:06:51       I think they might vary a little bit over. I don't know what they actually get in there, but it's probably about 94 during a show there next week. Where you do it with us. If I'm around warranties doing my podcast next week, it's like June 17th. Um, we're doing on a Wednesday night and I podcast and comedy show in there. If we had you, it'd be the three of us. It'd be insane. And red bands on Florentines on the 15th. So you're doing it on the 17th at 10? Yeah, if I can that, I'd love it man. That'd be so fun. New Material. Show the new material shot earlier. Yeah. And then we're right after. Okay. I'll do it. I think it is. I'm there then. Definitely be so great. That room is just so amazing. It's magic, right? I started in there and I just ruined the country. I just, you know, dice did a special in there. He did that first record in there. Right? And the o arm, that's what I heard, right? No. Yeah, I think so. Which one? Uh, the very first one that, the one that just says dice. Yeah, he did that in the belly. That's not good enough. I'm looking it up right now.

Speaker 12:         02:08:01       Try doing. What was the story that you told on podcast about Joe Walsh? Bill Walsh. Unbelievable story. Joe Walsh is first of all an APP.

Speaker 2:          02:08:13       Absolute King. Like, let me tell you, he's one of the nicest guys I've ever opened for a. he's like, so cool. You think it'd be Joe Walsh? I can't. I'm in the eagles. Who the fuck are those? It wasn't like that at all, but we're eating a, a deli tray and he comes into the dressing room and he says, hey, don't eat that shit. And we're like, what? Why? And he goes, ah, you don't know what's in there man, you know, it's just a Shitty Deli tray. Don't eat it. He's all. I got sick before. And I was like, Oh really? And he goes, yeah, let me tell you. He gets, after he was out of the eagles, he had a real low spot where he was partying hard and canceling gigs all the time. So he cleaned up and the manager said, we're book a tour, but if you cancel one show, all the shows will be gone.

Speaker 2:          02:09:02       So the first night of the tour, he's backstage eating on the deli tray after sound check and about a couple of hours later he gets mad food poisoning and he starts just shitting and shitting and he's like, what am I going to cancel on? The manager goes, you cancel this Gig. The entire tour is gone. So they go to Kmart or whatever was open and they get the rubber fishing waders. He puts them on the ones that go up to your tits. The river runs through it, fly fishing. He gets on stage and just start going at it. Why are you shitting?

Speaker 12:         02:09:37       Like every couple, like every few minutes is. Oh,

Speaker 7:          02:09:41       oh yeah.

Speaker 12:         02:09:48       Shitting into rubber letters. Then he said mid show. He didn't expect

Speaker 2:          02:09:53       this, but the heat from the lamp started burning the

Speaker 7:          02:09:58       diarrhea acid on his legs. So I looked at it.

Speaker 12:         02:10:04       Joe Walsh, we're wearing those because he wore weird shit all the time. Shitting himself with weirs on first for him though. First Minute I met him. That's the story. Tell me, and I hope it's true. It's so great. It's amazing. What a great story. I love the eagles, man. No, the eagles or rocky mountain high rocky mountain way is one of my favorite songs ever. Oh, I love that song. I love it. He a shoes, bom, bom, Bom, bom. What you're going to do to not their Mama, you know, he uh, he wrote that one on long run. It's great. Life's been good to me so far. Oh, great. Fucking sign. And it's also one of those songs about a guy talking about like, you know what, I'm just going to keep doing this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm living retarded rock and roll life. I got arrested. I'm doing stupid shit, but life's been good to me so far. That's my theme song, man.

Speaker 12:         02:11:06       He's in the fucking eagles, you know all the legendary bands. And that was the one that was featured in the big Lebowski. Dude. Hey man, it fucking eagles. Eagles never been offended going, how could you hit the Eagle's hotel? California the fuck. Do you hate Hotel California? I that record is so good, so much good. All their shit victim. The love the eagles documentary, right? Victim of love. It's fucking bananas. That's great. That's a serious fucking song. Desperado. The shit is great. Those guys are legends, man. Just handfuls of songs. Yeah, they had some great writing to, but Hotel California is one of the all time great songs. It really is. I love it. That in life in the fast lane man, man, they had some amazing, amazing fucking songs. What happened with those guys? They didn't get along. They broke up and they got back together again when they realized how much money was involved in.

Speaker 12:         02:12:02       I remember they did the hell. They said, we'll get back together when hell freezes over. And then in [inaudible] 96, I think it was, it's called the hell freezes over to. I was glad because I never got to see him and they opened. I saw him at the shoreline and the bear and they opened with Hotel California. Can you even fucking you opening Hotel California? Man Her in for a great concert. You Lion Eyes. That's a great fucking great man. Great one, I really liked the long run record. A lot of people don't like it. It's the last one before they broke up. It's just pure cocaine, but man, that's good songs on it. I'm already gone. Yeah, already already gone. Already gone is a great fucking song. Yeah, if they had some jams they did, man. Those were some driving songs to be in your car and those come on and go, fuck yeah, fuck yeah, I love that. Those guys, they had three voices. That's what's a great band. You got, you got, you know Glen Fry who added cool hit on Miami, vice member smuggler's blues. That's a great one thing. You Have Joe Walsh sings and then you have Don Henley sinks and then even the Bass player sings that one can tell you what song. Yeah, that guy's great, man. Great Song. Great Song. Wow, that's right. That's eagles to jam. So many hits gets those. That era, man, there was so much good music out of that era. It's weird how music comes big waves

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       like that. I guess comedy does too right now. It's a huge wave. This is probably the biggest waves I've ever seen. Yeah. Comedy wise, I think this is the biggest way that we've ever seen. We were talking about that the other night at the store. We were like this, the golden era of comedy and everybody agreed like at all. Like Sarah Silverman was onstage kill and I was hanging out with burr. We were in the backstage. We're talking about comedy today and this bird just got back from like 18. Sold out shows. Just crap. That show. It was crazy amazing, but we were talking about it. We're like, is this. Has there ever been a better time for standup then right now? And we were all like, just not. There's no better. I don't think there's ever been a better time with like more like big name headliners and more young guys coming up like the store.

Speaker 1:          02:14:13       I've been around the store. I took a seven year break, but I started there in [inaudible] 94. I never saw crop of hungry, dedicated new guys. Like now it's like there's always a few guys that were okay and I would like find those guys and try to help them would grab them, like, look, you could stay alive, but you got to keep moving, you know, but now it's like they have their own ecosystem. It's a totally different thing. There's way more power like that, that having that roast battle and all these different, like these bonding shows, they have these bonding shows, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:14:44       Absolutely. They're creating a complete environment of art. Man. You know, it's like there's no one around going, sorry man, you look like this or that, or you're too old or too young. It's like, Hey, we're all here and we're creating this.

Speaker 1:          02:14:59       Well that say that they're always the problem. People that you're too young, you're too old, you're too this. You're too, that you're too tall, you're too short. You those people. Always wrong. Always wrong. Because guys like Joey Diaz just exist. They don't. You can't ever script that. You can't hope for that to walk through your door. You can't turn a guy into that does. That is what it is. And he's the funniest guy. If this is the funniest time for comedy, I think it is. I think d is the funniest guy that's ever lived. I really do. I don't think there's ever been any funnier. I seen kinison live. I've seen Hicks live. I seen what I saw prior live. It was already really late in his life, but no one is ever crushed in front of me. Like, like Joey Diaz has. The other night he did the comedy story, did the or and I had a post about it on instagram. I was like, you just broke the world. It was insane. People were falling out of their chairs. It was screening. People were screaming, laughing, screaming.

Speaker 2:          02:15:55       And the great thing though is that he has a guy like you who shouts it out that that's not like, well, this is my world, you know, like the old world where people would be like, or this is all me and I'm not letting anybody else in.

Speaker 1:          02:16:08       Yeah. Well those. There's always a group of people. Back then when they had to be, everybody had to be the best. That was like one guy had the be the guy, whether it was dice, whether it was Kennison or was. There was like, there was always one guy that was the best and he thought it was the best and then he would have guys around him, but those guys always sucked. No, they weren't that good.

Speaker 2:          02:16:27       Somebody called them satellite. They weren't

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       that good, but like Diaz is the funniest guy alive now. He's the funniest guy ever and he's the guy I take with me on the road. That's great. Whenever I can, whenever he's not busy, but now it sucks because everybody knows I can't take him with me anywhere. He's always busy. Sells out every. He's just crushed. Denver. Just came in for NATO. He hadn't been there. He had been banned from that club forever. Wow. I'm at nine in there at the end of the month places the first time ever. I love that. Amazing. That's where I filmed my last comedy special on comedy central special. I knew that when I went in and I was like, this is the one where you did your special on a rocky mountain high. Right, and then I go in there and after the first joke I drop in my head, I got like edit that fucking rock cave hits that.

Speaker 3:          02:17:17       The people are on the stage, the places alive. It's electric too. Crazy little club, crazy, crazy, crazy little club, but it's just this time man, this is really unprecedented were all comedians are supporting each other too. It's not like that whole backstabbing Johnny Carson type thing we were talking about before. He used to be like that with comedy too, but sound like that anymore. Everybody's like, this is a great group of people supporting each other. Now I got lucky. I didn't come in in the nineties, you know, I mean fun. A lot of people already came in the nineties. Yeah, but I'm just saying it was like there wasn't much of a scene, you know, it was after that eighties gold rush. Well that's when I came in. I came in in [inaudible] 94. That's when I arrived at the store. It was the worst time ever.

Speaker 3:          02:17:59       Well, the time when I came in, when I first got there, it was the worst era for the store ever. Wow. There was. You would go there on a Monday or Tuesday when he would see dog shit. Wow. Those guys were. There was terrible comedy going on. A bunch of them and the guy that ran it was a fucking drunk and it was, it was pre Tommy. It was another guy read it. This fucking thing was a disaster. That's crazy. Yeah. Oh God. There were so many like leftovers that should have made it from the eighties but didn't. And they fell apart. They were still doing the same material, but it was the. You know how you get a few of those guys that occasionally you'll see one of those guys today. It still has the same act for like you'll be at the ha ha or giggles or something like that.

Speaker 3:          02:18:41       It's crazy, right? You're like, Whoa, this guy doesn't have. This is some old material. Yeah. Well that was what you've got in the nineties, but there were guys from the eighties because it was a big wave in the eighties. The wave was like from 80, early eighties to like late eighties and then it started to die off into the nineties. The comedy clubs started closing. The Boston scene collapsed like all those evening at the Improv shows kind of drifted away. There was a bunch of those shows for a while and then they slowly all faded away and that was in the early nineties and that's what I came around at the leftovers. Wow. There was so much bad comedy and there was a very few people. There's no one from my era that started off in [inaudible] 94. That's around today. Wow. At the comedy store. No one knowing that I could think of.

Speaker 3:          02:19:30       I can't think of one guy who was with me back then who was in my state. I was already headlining on the road and I had a television show, but realistically I've learned how to do standing up at the store and that's bad ass. Realistically. That's me too. That's her. I learned some jokes. I knew a little bit about comedy, but I learned. I really learned that at the store that are just. And it changes all rules and it gets you ready when you're out on the road. You Go, oh, I seen this in the belly rooms. The or compressed to a diamond valley runs like a half of our half the alarm. It's like, this is a fort. I call it a comedy for go upstairs. You're in the fort, you know, and it just feels good and you're looking at naked pictures to collapses. Especially like those Roast Battle Knights. I don't even like going up there. This is going to go in the kitchen.

Speaker 3:          02:20:29       Too many. I mean not enough people in here. It's great now with periscope though, because all of us just sit and watch it on periscope now. It's got three feeds. You got to be there though. Do it because they're going to judge and in a couple of weeks I can't wait. You know what the problem with periscope is though, that some people that are outside of it are not going to get it and they're going to get angry. Like at the whites only table. Yeah. And all the racism and the black wave. There's like, what did they call it? The Negro waves? Yeah. My Boy Jeremiah Watkins is in that white though. He's allowed. Yeah. Yeah. It's a whole thing is a. it's. It's a magic place and that killed Tony too, is a big part of that too. Yeah. Yeah. You guys doing that podcast out there and getting all these young people giving them this one minute shot and it made Kim and made sure Sarah.

Speaker 3:          02:21:17       No, those, those girls came out of that and now they've got careers now things are happening for that. Well, that's a good support group. You know, when you have a podcast and other people in America are listening, they get, man, I think I could try that, you know? Well I get these tweets all the time from people. Like they'll see the show that will put together on the ice house or something like that and they'd be like, fuck, I live in the wrong place. Is Crazy. You guys have these shows. They're on a regular basis. I know, right? The other night it was, it was des. I rera Brian Cowen, me and Duncan. Oh my. It was just a fucking tornado hit. That place is insane, dude. All those guys on their own make me laugh. So fucking hard man. You know, like Tom, I rarely, I, I went on the road with him and man, I just laughed my ass off the whole time onstage, offstage, eating, whatever, you know, it's just always great. Like look at you and wanting to be on the road with dom. So, so cool. And he's been in it for ever, like worries me with his drinking though. That's the only thing I worry about dom is that he's getting older and he just, he can't hit it hard every night. Pop a Xanax

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       and keep.

Speaker 11:         02:22:28       When he first came on the podcast, he was like all fucked up on the Xanax you talked about.

Speaker 1:          02:22:33       Still takes them every night. He takes one every day, but he likes it for whatever reason, you know, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          02:22:41       Hey, that is great man. He's great.

Speaker 11:         02:22:44       An addiction. Yeah. I need to go back to cigarettes or something. The fuck are you talking about? Why would you say that? Mine's comments quit. You just quit cigarettes for like four days. That's it, and you're like, I need to go back to cigarettes as if it was a long time ago. Back in the day, working out, going to pop up. Of course he made a fort, added five copies, stirs up your toe. You'll use as an excuse. Fuck this, I need a cigarette. I stub my toe, scuffed my new sneakers. This bullshit need, man.

Speaker 1:          02:23:17       He just got to need to. You got a need to escape. Then you've got to be really careful about that because you're doing something that's going to eventually give you an illness and you know, most likely one of those incurable ones like lung cancer. And if that happens, dude, you'll be thinking like Johnny Carson was like Johnny Carson before he died, would just walk around the house with an oxygen mask and go those fucking cigarettes and that's all he would say. Those goddamn cigarettes. I was fucking cigarettes.

Speaker 2:          02:23:44       I create a man. It was brutal, but it's like I was telling Brian, I saw this guy, he was 30 and he gets to hang out at this bar. I'd go to all the time, one day showed up, he goes, yeah, I'm going to be coming here for the rest of my life. And I go, yeah, I know you're here every day. And he goes, no, I just got six months to live. He got lung cancer, but it was from a specialist or something, but he also smoked, but I saw them whittle away in three months. He looked like Mr Burns from the simpsons. He had the oxygen thing and he came in and I was like, I'm off these men and I got the fuck off him. It scared me because he was just his 30 and dead know dead. No, no. He died instantly and that was an I can 90 lung cancer's not cute. It's gross.

Speaker 11:         02:24:31       Yeah. Nina diction. I mentioned I'm in a pill addiction but that'd be good. Xanax. Uh, I just, I, I just don't get why. Like everyone I know is either on adderall or Xanax. They either have an up or down and you talked to these people and they're like, oh no, I only like downers or I only like uppers and it's, it's everyone seems like they're on something for some of the mistakes that people are trying to solve. Medical. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:24:56       yeah. No, I've tried to go the full clean route and be like, just to see like my memory is fire right now. I quit caffeine. My memory is incredible

Speaker 11:         02:25:06       because you quit caffeine so it was all Kinda just drink like 10 coffees a day. Then I'd be on stage and just be like bird man. Like sometimes they get a twitch up here. Too much caffeine. Do you ever get that? It's twitching here while you're onstage. Is that what that's from? From caffeine

Speaker 12:         02:25:24       or sleep deprivation and it wind stop and they'd be like, God damn it. My guys are doctors. They're self diagnosing. I'm getting canker sores from mentos and this guy's getting twitches from coffee for sure. Definitely from the coffee fucking 25 years. You were stuffing it through your fucking nose. Oh Man. I've had some close calls on coke five calls. I had the numb arm in Marin, had an MRI dated a bit about it, but I was in Laurel Canyon. I remember there was just the first time I ever really saw pyramid a coke, like people tried to do that because the scarface, you go to parties, Nigga, they had a pyramid of how many people are stealing it. Like putting them in touch with you think. Right. But, but like the people that are there, they're just like, yeah, there's plenty of coke, you know, how much does something like that cost, like a pyramid would probably be a key of coke, you know, like I don't know, back then what?

Speaker 12:         02:26:28       That's big money like a back then and eight ball was 3:50. Three and a half grams. Okay. Well look, just give me a guesstimate. Let's say 5,000 bucks. 10,000. Well you think about the amount of money to some people spend on parties just for like catering and shit. Yeah, right. Having a band play and fucking ice sculpture, why not have a big giant brick of coke? Yeah, absolutely. And it looked pretty impressive when you come in and go, well that's an actual pyramid of coke, but if you got busted, if the cops came, they probably busted for distribution. That's prison there. That's a key. Uh, below you can't go. We're having a party. What kind of party it was. Smith Barney. Yeah. It's such a Walsh party, bitch, get out of here. I went over and I just kind of scooped a pile off of it and oh my God.

Speaker 12:         02:27:16       It's like, you know, you can't tell. You're not lucky as this looks good here. There's. And I blasted it up and I swear to God about it a minute later I was like, oh, my arm was totally numb. And I was like, Oh fuck. And have problems, you know. So do you think that it was cut with anything was it was just clean, super cold, you know, like real cup, you're not used to doing some super good coke. And, and I go up to the guy got hit and he got to call an ambulance and he's gone and he's like, no way man. That'll attract heat. You gotta ride it out, dude, that's the same thing, man was talking about the 18 minutes Chinese write it out, you know, and you're like, dude, I eat too much. What? He ate too much Chinese food once, just like tons and like I guess from the salt, tons of salience that's a week talking about doing and almost dying and he's like, ah, too much hateful young.

Speaker 12:         02:28:14       I almost died. Totally. Same thing like if you eat shitloads of like salt in your body or too much like I've had too much sugar in my fucking foot starts tingling that ever happened to you? How do you guys know what is causing the ice cream Sundae? Gummy bears will eat like bags of K. I go, hey dude, that was too much. Your body is held together with those gummy bears. Gummy bears are the glue to keep your organs functioning. That's the connections between the neurons and the tissue. That's limit and they told them, don't stop partying because you will die. I really tell them that they own that Mami documentary. They're like a, well, your body's immune to it now. It probably go in shock if you didn't have it. Whoa, that's pretty well. You drink that much with drinks and a does a little powders I believe is living.

Speaker 12:         02:29:09       I don't know. He's like 70 or something. Can you look that up? Let me. He was sick last year. Pretty bad man. From what?

There he is with his collection. He's gotten all those war swords and stuff in his house. Where does he live?

Speaker 12:         02:29:58       He lives by the rainbow in the same apartment he's had for like 30 years. Really? Yeah. Wow, what a mad man. I have it right. Just rocker and he's still just hits the road and just put a new record coming out. Does he have any kids? I don't know. I don't think so. He was. He had two children. He was Hendrix.

Speaker 11:         02:31:20       while on the podcast. I was at this girl's house the other day and some 65 year old guys sitting on the couch and I'm like, why is that guy? I'm leaving, what is this place? Went over her house and it was a guy just sitting on the couch. She's invited me back to her house with this girl. I'm hanging out with these two girls periscoping and then I'm like, wait a second. There's a 65 year old man creepily watching me and this was the guy. Who was he? I don't know. He's just some doctor to this. When does it play with the two girls? One threw up on you. Hold on. Wait a minute, hold on. Jesus Christ. Doctor wanted you to play with these guys. I just wanted to watch us play together like all three. If was just hanging out for you and the two girls and the. The guy was just like whacking off in the corner. He wasn't wearing off. You're just hanging out just doing this weird seed. You talk to him at all? I tried to but he was weird so I was just like, whatever. I'll just. These two girls are drunk right here, so I'll just hang out with them and so we're periscoping his house. I, I'm starting to think it was jim mentioned, if you get to that point where you.

Speaker 1:          02:32:28       You're so desperado is a sugar daddy that you tell girls, look, I don't even care if you bring guys.

Speaker 11:         02:32:33       Yeah, I think when you live here, I think will bring guys back. You do whatever you want. Just let me know. Just send me a jerk off in your mouth. Every couple of days I ran out. That is awesome. I mean I was pretty sick. What they have to do to get by in this world, man, people have to fucking survive. He living on the streets in Bangladesh. Alright, you gotta walk barefoot and carry a basket on your head. If you're a 65 year old dude and you got a house in the Hollywood hills and you want to get laid, you're not famous. What do you do? You're not lemmy from motorhead, bitch. You got to let these girls live in your house and bring home dudes like, well, we can't stay. We need to bring home guys, bring them here. Pregnant. Just don't disturb me when I'm beating off. That's basically the, the whole recipe of the playboy mansion. A lot of ways. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:33:20       Well there was a house that I looked at. There was one point in time where I was thinking I should probably live in the Hollywood hills, be easier to get to the store and I get home quicker, get more work done and be like I could live anywhere. I thought about it for a very short period of time, like maybe a couple of weeks. And I looked at this one house and the House that I looked at was a really cool. And this guy had this glass back window, like his entire back of his house was glass and he was a guy that invented bell bottoms. Allegedly. This was a story behind this guy. And uh, they used to call them wild man. This case to show up at it is when Eddie Bravo was a DJ script strip club and uh, Eddie used to work at the Strip club and this guy was rich as fuck. And he would come in and he would pay a shit load of money to get these girls come back to his place. He would go to strip clubs all throughout the valley, go everywhere wanted you, had like a whole place that he would go during the day and he would get these girls. And the story was that this guy was a straight laced guy who smoked a lot of cigarettes and he went

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       to the doctor and the doctor said, listen man, you're going to die. You got to stop smoking. Cigarettes are going to die. Look, if you need to smoke, smoke weed. I smoke pot. It's not. It doesn't give you cancer. So this guy starts smoking pot joints all day long. Just changes his life. Decides, you know what man, I don't want to work anymore. I have money. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm going to just play guitar and I'm going to get hookers. So this guy decided to do just play guitar and get hookers, but apparently he was really mean to them. Which is sort of the opposite of what you expect from potheads, right? That's filed bottom. Expect gentle and apparently he used to, he used to call it like bootcamping them bootcamp. These girls who treat them like shit, who pay him a lot of money, do you treat them like shit.

Speaker 3:          02:34:59       And he got off on the fact that he was as gross old guy and he would get these hot young girls and you would do mean stuff to, oh well this guy was selling his house. So I went to look at the house and I remember looking around and I was thinking, well this house is really expensive and it's right there on the street. And then I remember thinking like, this guy has been bringing these hookers back to this place. So it was like a lot of people are probably going to think that this guy is an asshole and then going to rob them or something. Like, what if I buy it? And they go looking for wild man. I'm like, Yo, I live here now. Fucking two weeks after I thought that he was killed in that house. He brought a girl home and a.

Speaker 3:          02:35:37       apparently the girl brought guys with her and they fucking shot him in the neck style, shot him in the neck and he bled out right in the front where I was walking around looking around. Why when I was looking around his house, go on, this fucking guy could get shot and this place. It was funny because I brought that up and the guy was selling the house, the real estate guy. He goes, don't worry, there's a state of the art security system. Cameras everywhere. And I go, you know what? Those cameras are going to show. They're going to show a due to ski mass shootings and good luck. That trial. What the fuck are you talking about? When I say that to the guy, the guy was like, you know, the salesmen like, you try to sell motorcycles just both trying to sell this fucking bad as Hollywood hills house. Um, but I bet they just fucking sucked that blood out with a vacuum. We cleaned it up nice. It's sold that bitch within a week. Those houses, they go like, I got up there.

Speaker 2:          02:36:26       That's Don Simpson's shit. You ever read that book? High Concept? It was the producer that did all the blockbusters. He invented the blockbuster, like uh, right after jaws. So a top gun. What's the race one with Tom's offender? Days of thunder. He was a lunatic. He gets street walkers, bring them up to his mansion that had a fucking, like a 20 foot fence all the way around and they'd be like, you're going to eat poo and shit. He just whipped coke and fucking went nuts. High Concept. Read the book. It's awesome. Hilarious.

Speaker 3:          02:37:00       But a guy on coke say you're going to eat poop. That language, like five-year-olds. That book is crazy. Hollywood weird us back then. That's so fucked. That thing that men want to women to get

Speaker 1:          02:37:15       through, do degrading shit at. So the way this is coming from the host of fear factor, I say with a grain of salt, but the idea that someone would, that that's what they get off on to get off on taking someone who desperately needs the money, bringing them to their own house where they live and sleep like you're. You're haunting that place with these memories of Demons bootcamping these campaign. That's what he used to call it. That was his, his expression fucking. He smoked a lot of cigarettes during his life. So he had that raspy cigarette voice. Yeah. Like, yeah, boot camp. Um, I remember when I met the guy felt really creeped out by them. Like I wouldn't want to buy a house from an asshole. No, just that alone. I wouldn't want just not interested in buying some assholes house. Now as I think you're the asshole vibe with spirit. It would stay in the house, man.

Speaker 12:         02:38:04       That's some creepy shit in the Hollywood hills that has gone down over the last hundred years. And it's just kinda like those ghost up there

Speaker 1:          02:38:13       know that the guy was an asshole. That'd be one thing. And you took it over and you're like, oh, I'll turn it into my house. I have a nice party with my friends over. This is my house now. Hay House. I'm just let you know. No more boot camping.

Speaker 12:         02:38:24       You're going to be nice to have barbecues and hug. We'll fucking swim together. Everyone's going to be nice here. Nope. Bootcamp.

Speaker 1:          02:38:42       Just, you know, if you know that it was an asshole house, it's tough to do. It's tough to buy. You have other choices, you know, want to buy someone's.

Speaker 12:         02:38:49       It's kind of like joey is this bathroom, you know, that's the most haunted. It's fucked up place in the road. Imagine living in his place. I would bug Joey Diaz. His house in a heartbeat. Ideas had a house and it was for sale. I'll probably buy it just to make sure nobody else had it. Yeah. My buddies, my buddies moved into Jerry Diaz is a apartment building over there. No horseplay is crazy. Crazy. Right? But was during the day

Speaker 1:          02:39:15       when Ralphie lived across the hall from Doug Stan. Hope who lived right down the street from Joey and Joey was staying with Gavin. Oh my God. It's chaos. That was a crazy comedy. Like squat house

Speaker 12:         02:39:29       at the. They're in there now. Luke is the bartender at the store and then my other buddy, Steve Henry, he moved in. So it's like comedy. It's across the street from the game, right? Yeah. Yeah. How much does it cost to even rent up? Nine slash 50. It's good for the size. For one bedroom. It's like a massive studio was separate kitchen everything, but you got to a garage and stay for Hollywood. That's pretty God damn good. If one of those places would be a good idea to do a podcast audio to you're so right now, like think about like how much you have to pay at the ice house. You could get like an actual studio apartment. Totally. Where's your studio? My studio is in a studio. Me and a couple of comics. We're actually thinking about a. they're building condos across the street. They're tearing down that

Speaker 5:          02:40:14       house of Blues. Just all chipped and yeah, that's going down. Take three more months. It's closed three more months and so they're building condos are sent. Me and a few comics were like, we should just rent a all chip in like $300 a month or whatever and rent a place. We could always just crash there if we went to.

Speaker 3:          02:40:29       Yeah. Instead of over those losers, gonna wind up living their true. Getting high on drugs camp. Oh my God, did I never going to forget that you'll never forget it. My friend Larry, who, uh, used to live in the Hollywood hills had the most amazing view I've ever seen in my life up there. To this day I've seen some dope views of nature, like nature views are my favorite views, but nature of use don't work at night. At night you just see dark mountains. But Larry had a place at the top of heaney and the view was like blade runner. It was like, it didn't seem real. It would look out. You're like, I didn't know anybody got to see this. Like the view of all those lights from a certain height, like you don't want to be too high up, you know, you see it from an airplane. Looks Pretty Dope, but there's something about being at the top of that dough. Haney area. Will you get this grid effect with this amazing light show at night? We would just go, we would go out to his place. I would bring people by his house just to look at the view at night and when he just got to see this, especially in a clear night, like after it rained. Oh my God, it was amazing. Pauly shore's how would fuck you up? His same thing.

Speaker 5:          02:41:45       He's got the. He's right at the top. I runyon three 63 slash 60. You got, you got a century city, you got the grove. Then over here you have downtown. Then behind him he has all the hills like running and everything, you know, and it's just with this light spill off infinity. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:42:03       Pool. And that would be one of those houses though where you wonder about the bootcamp in this house might be haunted.

Speaker 5:          02:42:13       You have to bring in some vegans to have a fucking Vegan. Seance. Yeah. You'd have to have some sort of a Yogi and an infinity pool. That's a hooker bath. Drains. Just pubic hair and condos. And it was an amazing. Patty said he bought it from the MTV money in the eighties and he still owns it.

Speaker 3:          02:42:33       Just rents it out and it's a good move. Yep. Real estate in the Hollywood hills is a great investment at smart. Well, Paul has been smart with his money. Like that really smart move. He owns a place above. Well, he sold it to Scott, right? Yeah, yeah, right. The one right behind it. The house know that's, that's a great spot to crave. Someone had that spot, the place. It's right at the top of that Little Hill. Dangerous. He asked me to run it for a while. He's on that house. He's like, you will live and pick the good room and then pick like four guys that you want to live with it. You can. Uh, you know, it's a great idea. Comedy House. Like they used to have an crest hill total. Yeah, exactly. But my only worry was like the comics moving every couple of

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       months ago can't make rent and then I'll send you this landlord instead of just a room. A. It sounds like work. Yeah. You got to collect money. Chase people down whenever you're dealing with broke dudes. It's always a man, which is exactly what you would deal with it. You got it. You would wind up having your name on the condo because the older guy, the ability, we'll just, we'll pay you and then you a man. You could just sell my part out. Someone else like what the fuck? Nobody wants it. And then how about this? You got rent. Why are you being a Dick? Man, that's the best. The best. Come on man. You got money. You owe money. Not what's going on here. Don't get mad at me. You fuck. It's crazy, man. That's the worst. The worst is when broke. People that owe money.

Speaker 4:          02:43:56       Turn it around and get upset at you. Yeah. Oh yeah. How about, how about what? You know, dude, where were living here? Yeah. Now I have to pay your apart and people just always look for some sort of an excuse to not have to contribute. It's just. And when you're dealing with starving, struggling artist, it's the same sort of mentality that makes people flick cigarettes out the window. It's not thinking about anybody but themselves. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It's a cigarette thing too, man. There's something about poison your body with cigarettes. I've always wondered, like I was hanging out with the tally of the day. I didn't bring it up because I love them, but smoke cigarette dropped on the ground, stepped on it, left it there, and I was like, dude, you know, that's littering. Like, what'd you do that with a rapper? Would you do that with like a, a glamorized growing up, you know, with James, Deane stepping on the cigarette or flicking it. It used to always be like a thing that you mean cops would, do you know it, it never was. It never was considered a lender. They sent me to the end like and then we went to boot camp.

Speaker 13:         02:44:55       Oh you want five grand? The house and put on the gloves.

Speaker 4:          02:45:06       Favorite is as they're driving this prius. Oh, I'm saving the environment. They flick a cigarette out of their fucking Prius. Dude. I've had a running tally on this show about people in praises that I've seen throw cigarettes out the window. It's up to eight people in a prius throw cigarette out the window. It's like, don't tell me you're driving that Prius for the environment or some money. They're cheap. You can try one of those things. Uh, Daniel Cormier, the UFC light heavyweight champ. He has won and he said it costs like 30 bucks to fill up and it lasts a month. Yeah. I went to, I went to San Fran with another comic and it, we put like $26 and we were there. I was like, are you kidding? Like my motorcycle. I stopped three times. They're great on gas, but their dog shit cars just killed it for me. Man. I've been in so many Prius's lately that every uber driver has. One is the track home of cars. That's what it is. It's a track home. They all look the. You just go

Speaker 12:         02:46:10       in and go, where's mine? Do you ever leave the arclight and you go look at the fucking Prius is in here.

Speaker 1:          02:46:16       Yeah. That's all it is, is everybody had one of those. It wouldn't be so dangerous. The problem is other people have fucking trucks, semis and shit. And you have a prius. Prius get hit by a semi. After I got rear ended, man, I started really reconsidering the type of automobile I drive. The Porsche took the hit pretty good because it's designed German engineering and as a crash beam in the back that absorbs the impact, but I didn't get hit that hard either. You know, you, you think about all these fucking idiots out there. Like I told you about van Owen Street, these caved in cars from assholes that are just texting or sleeping or whatever the fuck they're doing. That's the problem with driving as the other people. You're dealing with so many variables.

Speaker 12:         02:47:00       It's none of them have insurance either. Half these people on our roads don't even have licenses and insurance, whatever. It's brutal out there, man. I'm on a motorcycle and I just couldn't laugh like you. I'll look right at a guy, Joe. I'm riding. That guy will look at me. He'll look like this. He sees me put his blinker on. It just starts coming over. He doesn't give a fuck. Who knows you're going to move. So I started talking like, Hey man, I'm right here. Hey, and then now we won't look like, Oh, I don't hear you. I'm coming over here. I need this lane, and they just,

Speaker 1:          02:47:34       if they know that they can believe that's it, they can push you up. Do you see that video of the guy on the BMW and there's a guy on a motorcycle that has a Gopro on his helmet. That's unbelievable. I get off the fucking phone. Stay off the phone. You're driving. So then the guy runs them off the road. Yeah, he hits him on purpose. There's a video of the kid like looking to his left leg and his left foot. Boom. He gets hit

Speaker 12:         02:47:55       and you just hear and go, oh, oh fuck. This guy picks him up. He's like nine slash 11. I've been here. You know, it's, I should find whoever has that fucking BMW beat the fucking shit out of him. I can't believe that detail man. What cons? What a piece of shit that's a human on a vehicle easily could have been paralyzed. He easily could have said easily could have been run over in the other direction. Yeah, yeah. No, he loses his job. He's got broke legs now and he loses his house and everything for this fucking Dick that's like, I gotta get to my job. Fuck you. It wasn't what he was doing it on purpose. He did it perfect because that guy told him, get off your phone. Yeah. He first, he honks at him. He goes, Hey, get off your phone. And then he pulls up and then the guy like, oh, it turns eight bucks. Then he starts riding and left. It looks like he's like Santa, Santa Monica. What? Berea there. And then boom, the car hits him.

Speaker 1:          02:48:49       Yeah, most likely the kid did not have as A. Oh, here it is. We'll, we'll end. This doesn't have the fucking plate now. So he really doesn't know how to be a traffic camera or something. Well, one would hope so. But uh, traffic cameras probably most likely not going to get the. This isn't like serious. What's

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       on the brand there by Alan? Nate's says kid keeps looking back because apparently he's like right on birthday, right in front of coin. Jesus Christ man. So just cut them off. He just got in front of them. Wow, this guy helps him up. You shouldn't help a guy out when he announced it like that. I know he might be fucked up. I was furious when I saw visit visit my crowd funding site. That wasn't the car pulled over. The car took off, took off. It was a black beemer. No, it wasn't black right here, is it? No, it was before that. It was, um, you could see it before it. You could see the color before it. Before it, right at the beginning. Jamie?

Speaker 4:          02:50:01       Yes. It's a beamer on the left Femur, but it looks like it's look like kind of a gray. I can't believe that guy did that. Anybody knows who did a fucking find employees. That guy needs to be in jail. Can't move. Before you go, you got to hear this story. Joe Gilby Clarke from guns and roses. He was hit on his motorcycle on Ventura Boulevard about five years ago. Got Hits and runs them two years after that. Gilby hospital for the first six months. Can't walk plates in his legs. A cane got hit him and ran. The guys had a party two years later. He's telling the dude, yeah man, Hey, that guy a couple of years ago on a motorcycle. I just kept going, man, he's kind of drunk. I think. He goes, really? He goes, yeah, over on Ventura Boulevard, man. These bikers. Fuck them, man. I mean, you know, he, he, he, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          02:50:57       I hit him. I don't know what happened. The guy knew gilby called them. I guess I got the guy. He's at this party. Two years later they sent the police over. It was the dude. He told the story at a party, so this guy is not going to be able to. First of all, he has some damage on his car. He hit the bike most likely. So he's got something on the side of his class. He just bumped the wheel. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. You might have bumped the wheel yet from behind. He's going to tell someone because that's going to weigh on him. I hope so. May Too. What a cunt. That's such a scary thing that someone could do that to a person. Just hit them with a car is fucking brutal, dude. You know he was texting. He didn't realize he did it. No, he didn't.

Speaker 4:          02:51:40       He drove on that guy's ass and hit all the guy. Kept looking like he's coming up on him. You see his head, he's gone. What, what the fuck? You know? Well two things. One, don't start shit with someone that's just on their phone. Yeah, he can't do it. He shouldn't have done that in the first place. Not excusing the grind for hitting him in the car, but you know, you never know what you're catching someone you can. You might be catching someone at the fucking verge of a nervous breakdown. Their wife just broke up with him that she cleaned out the bank. The fucking.

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       They got fired at work. Their dog got poisoned by the neighbor or the [inaudible]. Who knows? Who knows? And you just, you know, fuck you. Get off your phone. What the fuck did you know? You're catching someone at nine touch the button. Exactly. Don't do it. Be Nice. Flux.

Speaker 12:         02:52:21       And this city is also filled with gangsters. I mean, let's be half these people are on your mind. Probably murdered. People add their packing.

Speaker 1:          02:52:29       Well, how many people out there just so angry and frustrated too? Yeah, I didn't get that role. Fuck him. Just everything. I mean there's 20 million people. You're dealing with way too many human beings. You're dealing with all sorts of fucking economic problems and who knows what else and relationship shit. There's an episode of Radiolab that I'm listening to right now where it talks about people that were going to kill somebody that almost we're going to kill somebody now. How prevalent it is. This woman was talking about this ex boyfriend that she had that was blackmailing her and said, you can't, if you have another boyfriend, I'm going to fucking tell them and I'm going to send them sex tapes that we made together and was saying that I want to haunt you for the rest of your life. So she invited the guy over her house and she was cooking dinner for him and she was going to stab him. Whoa. And she had the knife in her hand. The Guy ran away and they asked her like, how close were you stabbing him? She was like 60 percent, 60 percent established. She was thinking, if this guy wasn't in my life, I could be happy, and so she was just going to stab him like she was so maniacal about. And you've got to think how many people get that close. Yeah, but this is a normal person who got that close. They got that close.

Speaker 12:         02:53:37       That's crazy because then the, the next five minutes, your whole life changes and you go to prison. You know,

Speaker 1:          02:53:45       I would give her a free pass. I'd give her a pass. You guys a con? He's trying to fucking say she could never have a boyfriend again. He's going to send the out. That ruining her life. Apparently he was according to her vicious asshole. If you're a woman, man, this the shit that you have to deal with. It's not that much different than a lot of ways that, that kind of bullying, that kind of physical, frightening shit. It's a lot like someone in a car hitting someone on a bike. It's like you can get away with it, you know you can get away with it. So you do. What are you thinking? That moment, at least you can get away with it. That's the con deist aspect of people victimizing other people when they can get away with it. Like that black male is the garbage of America, which didn't have any violence in like that. Especially in relationship violence. It's a scary shit, man. That's what cops always say. It's the scariest thing for them when they show up. Domestic violence. Yeah. Wait, what'd you say about black guys? They sound what? He said, man. Black male, bro.

Speaker 12:         02:54:39       No, black man. Eric, a black band. Brian was Brian Band on Ferguson. Bride Red Band on Baltimore detail, right? We've got to get out of here that we ran out of time. That was three hours for real. Thank you so much for today and
