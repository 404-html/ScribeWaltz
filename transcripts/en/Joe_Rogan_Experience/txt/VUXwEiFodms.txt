Speaker 1:          00:00:00       There you go. I know. It seems like we were

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       great.

Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Now we are going to go cancer. No cans. What are you going to do? I'll, I'll go with you. I'm going to get a note. Cancer, a fucking animal. Semans just connect man. Let's mind meld. I think in mind meld more with those things on really some weird way. Yeah. Yeah. You were in each other's head. I just hate my voice. I sound like a woman. You definitely don't sound like a woman. Whenever I call for like tech support to lead me through the first few steps and then I'll be like, alright, and then I hit delete and they'll be like, no ma'am, what you do is. And then it's like it's too far into it for me to correct them because it feels too. I'm too embarrassed to correct them at that point. So then I just can't. I just let them assume I'm alone for the rest of the call and it's weird because then you see what it's like to be treated like a woman like he talks. I find that they talked down to you more like especially about tech support, right? Oh fuck. A chick on a computer. They treat you like you're a baby and now he's just screamed blue. Shake your little mouse. Why? Why is there a difference in like tech stuff? Like why are men more attracted to the tech stuff aren't, aren't we more

Speaker 1:          00:01:25       mathematical than women?

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       Well, that's a weird thing to say. I mean there's right and left side of the brain, right? I would say yeah, men are much more mathematical to women, but I'm not mathematical even slightly. So what am I a woman? You just said that like you're going to kick my broad. Like what do I read? Fucking chick lit. I'm a fucking skirt. I wish I was. Man. They get it made right now. Women got it made. How so? Well, because there's, you know, there's this sort of like postmodern feminism coming back where, you know, with this, with the lean in and the like, you know, women really, they really are going to start getting. I think they're still making like eighty cents on a dollar. Do you know that's all bullshit. I've heard you say that before and I wanted to correct. You know it's not true.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       It's not. It's not true. No. You know what that means when they say women make eighty cents of the dollar, it means overall women make eighty cents compared to the dollar that men make, but not for the same jobs when women and men are making, making the same when they're doing the same job, the, the, the problem with that statistic is it leads you to believe that a man and woman are working alongside each other doing the exact same amount of work, the same amount of hours, but the woman makes less. It's not the case in the same. Just a lot of executives. It's been that have been found out to be. I know a couple that were, that are executives that were doing the same job, leading the sales team and making less money. Perhaps. Perhaps there's a few exceptions, but for the most part when you talk about overall jobs, like it's pretty statistically proven that like lawyers, doctors, whatever the fuck the is when they're working

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       side by side, it's very little disparity. Yeah. Very little podcast thing is women take time off for work time off of work, for a maternity leave. Of course if they have babies, but also they tend to work less hours. Men tend to be more ambitious, more driven work, more hours and they get paid more because of it. Yeah, that's what it is. It's one of those weird ones where you're. Everybody says it. Even fucking Obama said it. You know the wage gap, the income gap. Like what? What do you mean? Like why are you saying that? Because you're. You're talking about you talking about it as if there's some sort of discrimination when in fact there's a natural tendency that a lot of women have to choose different jobs. Like as far as like nursing, like overwhelmingly a. it's predominantly women. So you're saying if you take the total amount women make versus the total amount, men May. That's where the eighty cents on the dollar difference, but it's the job choices.

Speaker 3:          00:03:53       You're saying the exact right job choices. Men are much more likely to die on the job. Yeah. Um, men, men are much more likely to take high paying high risk jobs like mining things on those lines. Yeah. So that's what that is. It's one of those weird ones where you repeated a lot of people repeat it and they think it's right. They think that men and women who are working alongside each other making the same amount of money. The other thing about executives is, and this is something that no one wants to say because it sounds sexist, but it might be that the men are earning more money. Like it might not just be that they're making more money. It might be their actual performance as an executive is better. It's entirely possible. It is possible. But I can also see, um, like if I hired a man and a woman, I would pay the woman less

Speaker 4:          00:04:40       just because you know, men are just.

Speaker 4:          00:04:45       Did you better looking? You want them around more women are gross. How dare you leave periods who I like literally if you. Why would I pay somebody who's bleeding on the job as much as a man? I'm glad I never have to have a workforce. I mean, what do you got? But he got one guy. You got to. You got a few people working for you. Yeah, but they're guys. Call guys. Sexy guys. Okay. You're a good looking guy. Jamie is not a bad looking dude. You play sports. What'd you play? I played back in high school. I played basketball for four years. For the city. For three? Yeah. You got a lot of pussy. I bet. How old were you when you lost your virginity? Oh, 17. Slow. A little slow on the uptake there? Yeah. 17. You want to choose wisely? How old were you?

Speaker 3:          00:05:42       16. 15. Almost 16. Maybe older woman. I bet. No, I got molested by a girl when I was 13 and she was 21, but nothing really happened. It was one of those weird ones, like she was grabbing my deck. I was all confused and I made out with her, but I was like, how are we doing here now? She's so confused. I. You hit puberty yet. I mean, I guess I was 13. When do you hit puberty? I didn't hit until I was 15. I wasn't beating off at the time. I actually had sex before. Beat off. No Shit. Yeah, well I was just, I didn't. Once I figured out beating off though, I was like, oh, I'm a slave. I'm a slave to getting rid of this. Come up. Like, oh no. And then I realized like once I beat off, I was like, oh, why can do this myself?

Speaker 3:          00:06:34       And then I'm not so fucking needy and weird. I remember the first time I was dating this girl and the first time I beat off and then I was like, I don't even want to call her. Yeah, I got, I don't want to hang out with her. Like, this is annoying. And I realized like, Oh, I wasn't so much that I was attracted to her. Was that not that it wasn't attractor. It wasn't so much that I enjoyed being around her. I was, I wanted to have sex with her and then once the sex was taken out once a book get rid of the load, I was like, oh, I don't really want to be around her. This is just some biological trick. Yeah. Like my body's tricking me into wanting to be near her and hanging around with her. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:07:14       Weird. Yeah. Because teenage boys and girls have sell a little income and all you care about is sports laughing, trying to get fucked up will, you didn't really do that. But like we did and then uh, and girls at that age are just extremely social beings. They're very much about, um, their social circle and um, you know, establishing who's in the group. And he was like, I'm just talking about my, my daughter is like this. And I think that they're much more like in line with what school is telling you to do. You know, they tend to do better in school because they're a little bit more linear and they uh, they, they're self motivated more than boys where we just were just distracted too much.

Speaker 3:          00:07:57       I think what boys also have like a serious problem with authority, I want to. Teachers are telling you what to do. You automatically don't want to do it. That's just a natural inclination that people have of now I'm getting scared. Yeah, that's illegal though. Can blow it in my face on legal problem with that. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:08:14       that's totally illegal. I got a total second hand high and the Green Room at the comedy store the other night. Holy Shit. That was like, there was a cigar going, five joints going.

Speaker 3:          00:08:27       Ron White doesn't play. He pulled out a joint yesterday. We killed the joint and after the join pulled out, one of those vape pens is big gigantic robot Dick. I'm like, Jesus, wrong. It goes that weed is like, Oh hell yeah, it's, we good Lord. So he's got a cigar going. He brought it, brings his own Tequila because he now has his own Tequila company. Now he does this. He does, so he has its number one Tequila Tequila, so he brings this bottle of Tequila. It's really good Tequila and then he's smoking a cigar. He's passing out shots, he's brings cups back there, handing out shots of his Tequila. Ron Wyden is damn walking party. He is a walking part.

Speaker 4:          00:09:04       Hydro drove home the other night because he doesn't drink and drive and he really admire. He goes to me, he goes, hey, you want to just dry dry, be home with my truck and then take an uber back and then he hit your car and drive home. I'm like, yeah, that's not happening. I go, you want a ride home? And he's like, uh, yeah, I'll take a ride home. I'll leave. I'll leave my truck here. So, uh, so he gets in my Prius, which immediately he gives me shit for the entire way he can barely fit in it. And uh, and we, we get, we are and I'm going down sunset here. Yeah, go down this way. So I'm driving. All of a sudden we hit like Beverly Glen and I'm like, where's your fucking house? He goes, where are we? I go, we're in fucking like ballet or something, and so he's like, no, no, no, go back.

Speaker 4:          00:09:48       So we go back all the way to the comedy store and start from scratch, start from scratch, take a right down there and then I'm going down a fucking cannon or something and he's like, uh, Nah, you went too far. I'm like, how the fuck did I know I was going too far? What was far? What was the spot? And then I can't make a left. So you guys just make a left. I'm late. My wife is going to be why? I told her I was gonna be over at 10:30. I'm like, look, I'm not getting a fucking t the middle of Beverly Hills where you get ticketed for fucking picking your nose. I'm not making the legal levies. Like, no, make the left. I'm not making the fucking left. So I go past it and I doubled back and then I get, I get to his place and his place is a hotel. Did he talk about this on your show? Why don't want to like do it is personal.

Speaker 3:          00:10:33       You definitely said the name of the hotel, but he, he had a water problem and it's not about that, right. He spent like, I think more than two years building this house. He told me five years, bought it and then they had to get the plans approved and then the building. Yeah. So it was a total process of about five years. Right. So I think, but I think it was two solid years in building this house. Right. So he goes out of town and a water faucet broke and the whole house from the top floor flooded all the way down to the bottom.

Speaker 4:          00:11:06       All the walls have fucking fungus and mold in them and it's a complete tear down.

Speaker 3:          00:11:12       Have you ever had that happen to you ever have like a fungus or mold issue?

Speaker 4:          00:11:16       Yeah, we did. And um, it wasn't lethal. We got to test it. It was a mold and my wife's very sensitive to it, so she was getting all kinds of like allergies from it and they came in and the testing is fucking expensive and it was just, you know, it was just a leaky pipe under the house and you know, it's in Venice so it's, it's kind of moist down there and uh, they just, you know, they, they shaved it out. Bag. No, no big deal now. But if it's the wrong kind of mold, I mean it can cause fucking, like your brain can go.

Speaker 3:          00:11:47       Do you remember that Tom? Like this guy, very nice guy, great guy. Tom Like is

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       Tuesdays crazy? What a whip them out Wednesday to know what you're driving. I had one opie and Anthony had whip them out Wednesday, right? Tom had like flash Friday. Yeah, driving down a highway or the road and you show your tits to guys and then they call in and then you know, opie and Anthony got mad because they thought that Tom has stole the idea from. And I'm like, listen boys, it's just gets the more tickets come out, the better. Don't stop. Not Encouraging people, what are you doing? Every radio one of the country should have a day where women share their kids. I mean, it should be just a part of what people do. I was doing, uh, you know, Bubba, the love sponge right down in Tampa. That dude is fucking out there as we know because his wife had sex with all Kogan and there was a video tape of it going around, which he basically got a web.

Speaker 4:          00:12:47       What's the website that gets shut down because of Gawker fucking folded because of that lawsuit from Baba or was there a wait who did the lawsuit? Baba or hall collected. Oh, hulk did it. So I go down above his place and it's so weird because Tampa is a fucking eerie mystical place anyway. And so they picked me up to go to radio and we're going down these back roads through swamps and shit. And we pass a girl scout camp and um, and then all of a sudden there's this long driveway. It's like a picture, like you picture, like the allman brothers must be making a new album at the end of this, this fucking read the shack and you go back there and he'd go in and they're like, all right, this is Bob's place, and there's a. there's a midget on a couch in the waiting room, and he pissed.

Speaker 4:          00:13:36       He had pissed the couch, like they got them drunk on the show, so drunk that he, that he pissed themselves in the studios. They put them out on the couch. Oh my God. He was angry. He was angry at me and I'm like, dude, I have no idea your situation. I just guide. I'm next. And so I walk in and everybody's drinking pabst blue ribbon. This is like 7:00 in the morning drinking pabst blue ribbon and they. They gave me this joint to smoke, which I didn't expect it to be that strong and I, I was. I was ripped out of my mind. So I go into the studio and Bubba has a 12 gauge Israeli handgun, which is a fucking monster, a shotgun, handguns, something like that. He pulls out this huge 12 gauges, like a shotgun. He said it was a 12 gauge.

Speaker 4:          00:14:25       Maybe I got it wrong, but it's huge. It's huge. Pulls it out and he's like, my phone just started googling. You just say, Hey Siri. And then now it's doing. And um, so he pulls it out. He's like, Nah, Nah, it's cool. And I'm like, well then why did your entire staff just fucking run out of the studio? And I'm the only one in here and I'm stoned in 7:00 in the morning. And so he's waving it around and then he starts taking calls because he sends, he sends this van out, they call it the hand job, the handicap van, and they pull up to office buildings and they entice guys to get in the van with his hooker who gives them handjobs live on the radio before they go to work.

Speaker 4:          00:15:12       And that goes on. And then a call comes in from a guy who's about to rob a bank in Michigan, I guess to show syndicates to Michigan. And so he's talking this guy out of robbing a bank. The guy was for real. Oh my God. And uh, and so, and this all goes on. I mean this went on for like two and a half hours and then all the sudden it just ended and I walked out. I felt like a, I felt like, what's his name and in Training Day, uh, Ethan Hawke, you know, after he just tripped and been lead through this gauntlet of and uh, and I, I go back every time. I love it. I did it once. It was fun. Yeah, it was a good dude. The, the, the morning radio thing. Conduct and fucking get you. Yeah. I was just thinking, what was that guy who was an athlete that shot his driver?

Speaker 4:          00:16:06       Do you remember that story? It was a radio guy. No, he was a professional athlete and he pulled out a gun. Jason Williams does that, who it is that his name? Um, but he had like a, a limo driver and apparently he pulled out a gun. He was like playing with a gun and accidentally shot and killed his limo driver. And it was like, whoa. Wow, look what the fuck? Jason Williams, he was a basketball player, like pulp fiction. I mean that kind of stuff happens. Imagine if you got shot by bubble, the last punch. Like that's how it ends. That's how you go to the next stage of life. You got accidentally shot by Baba. Yeah, dude, here it is. Williams. I was a coward for covering up shooting of the limo driver. I mean is he free now? Spent 26 months in prison and starting in 2010. So yeah, maybe battled with alcoholism. Well here's the thing. Incredibly shadow with a 12 gauge shotgun. But here's the thing. Say you kill a guy by accident with a gun. You then have a choice to cover it up or come forward and say, I did this whole shit. Now existentially,

Speaker 4:          00:17:27       is it so wrong to cover it up? I mean, you're going to feel bad for the rest of your life. You don't really need to be punished. It's not going to change how his family feels about it. Just say somebody else shot him. That's a DB argument. A DB argument about ethics. [inaudible]. You're gonna. You know you're going to face a of

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       hate of hate, right? No one's going to believe you have you say it was an accident. People are gonna. Absolutely. Assume that he murdered them. You know they're going to pursue it that way. But on the other hand, you did fucking kill a guy.

Speaker 4:          00:18:07       Alright, what if here's it more innocuous situation. You're driving down an alley late at night and a homeless person walks out in front of your car and you hit him and he dies. You can either just drive away, wash your car and know that a homeless guy is no more. Or you can go get the police and say, yeah, I was speeding and I killed a man. It's like that Johnny cash song.

Speaker 5:          00:18:39       Isn't it fascinating that when you say that story, when you give that scenario that a homeless person in some way or another makes it like less fucked up?

Speaker 4:          00:18:50       No, I just made in terms of like the family blaming you for it. Nobody's going to blame me for

Speaker 5:          00:18:55       for this, but, but even even so, like it's not as bad as scenario as hitting a nice person who's got their shit together.

Speaker 4:          00:19:06       Well, it's like if you kill somebody and you get sued by the family, depending on it. Like if you, if you kill a child and you get sued, they're not. You don't have to pay a lot of money, but if you kill a guy who's supporting his family, they, they'll take everything you got. So that life in the eyes of the, the law is

Speaker 5:          00:19:25       worth more. How strange is it that we put a monetary value on actual life itself? Wow. It's just such a strange, strange concept. Yeah. Did you see that guy accidentally hit that Moose with his car now? Holy Shit, Jamie. Pull that video up. I tweeted it. This guy's driving down the road somewhere probably near where they kicked you out of that club that one night

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       made you drive home and drive home and because of Moose they kicked you out in great detail. It was supposed to be a clean gig. He gets up there, he starts swearing, they kicked him out, they kicked him out. They had his bags packed. By the time he gets off stage,

Speaker 4:          00:20:10       spend the night at the hotel after you do the Gig and they fucking five hours drive.

Speaker 2:          00:20:17       Whoa.

Speaker 6:          00:20:19       Oh

Speaker 5:          00:20:21       yeah. Fucking

Speaker 4:          00:20:22       crazy, crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:20:26       Everybody else has slowed down all these other people. It's slowed down a route. People had seen the Moose and they were kind of checking it out, but look, this guy fucking hits it full on and since everything flying, that was like an Olympic big

Speaker 5:          00:20:39       tumble. You gotta wonder like, is that Moose dead now? I'm surprised the car wasn't trashed more. Do you think Moose is dead? Got Up and walked away. Oh, Jesus, look at that. That is insane. Something flew off and he lost her first. Fuck right. You can create an animal. No, no, not like that. I've hit squirrels and rabbits. I ran over a raccoon with a big wreck. Oh Jesus. It made a big thumping noise under the car. I've. I was grossed out for hours. Just disturbed. Boom. Look at that and that thing goes flying. That's a huge animal. Yeah, they're dangerous in that sense. Yeah. No, I think most are dangerous in the wild. They can be there. One of the few deer species that will go after you. Yeah, probably the only one. I mean maybe an elk would go after you maybe, but it's pretty rare like you have to fuck up to get an elk to attack you.

Speaker 5:          00:21:38       Yeah. But if you're too close to a Mama Moose and she's got her babies in there, she'll just fuck you up. Yeah. There was this kid that got killed. I want to say it was on a campus somewhere in Alaska and apparently someone had been throwing snowballs at the Moose and they had agitated the Moose and this guy just walked in wrong place, wrong time and the Moose just starts stomping the shit out of them. It's really hard to watch. This guy just gets stomped and stomped and stomped by this huge animal and she's rearing up and trying to kill him and keep stomping on him. It was horrific. He just bang, Bang, Bang. Just getting pummeled by these. I mean this thing is a thousand pounds and it was because they were throwing snowballs at him because somebody else apparently had been agitating the Moose before this guy got there. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:22:35       Don't fuck with wildlife, man. Had that gun. Not Gun. That's a bad one to fuck with. You know, you gotta think in their environment. They're fighting off bears and wolves and shit. They just constantly like kicking at things. Yeah. Have you ever been. Not attacked, but have you had an animal? Like had you lined up in the cross hairs when you're hunting or anything? Not that I know. Have you ever had a bear like come out about a bear? I've had a bear, like encounters with bears. It's weird. You see them, but most of the time they just run away. Yeah, like A. I saw a grizzly bear once. That was a weird one because they have a different way of looking at you as opposed to like a regular beer does. Like a brown bear is a more aggressive bear in terms of like a, it's more of a hunter or as black bears, they're.

Speaker 5:          00:23:23       They're kind of hunters, but they're more. I think they tend to eat more berries and things along those lines, but those big ass brown bears, they have to be like really aggressive because they're so big. Like you've got to feed a thousand pound body or whatever the fuck. Did they eat meat? Oh yeah. What do they eat? Bears eat a lot of crazy shit, man. They'll eat like a beached whale. They'll camp out on a beach. Whale eat that fucking thing for is rotten and disgusting. Wow. That's one of the best places that people find them. If you want to go bear sighting, you want to go looking for bears and spot those big Kodiak bears. They go to places where bears would find like a dead whale. It's almost lover. Yeah. It just gets rancid and disgusting and they're still chewing it up, but they, they just have to eat a lot.

Speaker 4:          00:24:14       What's your, uh, what you usually kill something for the winter to eat. Right? Usually an elk who is ever going to go for this year, trying to either got one already this year. How you did. Okay. Is that the one you were carrying? Um, when, when you show me a picture of you fucking carrying an animal on your back that you had killed.

Speaker 5:          00:24:34       I think that was a different one. Yeah. You can't carry an elk on your back. It's way too big. Yeah. And silk is like a thousand pounds. So you cut it up out in the wild. We'll put it in coolers or something. I did it at this ranch and they have a bunch of guys that work at the ranch that just drag it into a pickup truck and then you take it to like this cold storage area and the cold storage area that break it down. Yeah. But what you do is you just cut the quarters off, you cut the legs off and you break it down just like a butcher shop does freely. Very. Um, it's very weird to see man because it becomes meat. Like it starts off an animal and then it becomes meat as opposed to just seeing meet, like once. It's once it's down and it's, you know, you start breaking it down. It's like a sober, sober reminder of what meat actually is. One day they're going to have that lab to test tube meat that they're working on, you know, that stuff they're doing. One day they're going to have that. That's going to be like fully fully available and there's going to be no more.

Speaker 4:          00:25:47       Last night I was talking to the, uh, the chef at the laugh factory or the comedy store, you know, the cook back there. Got It. Just fucking smiles all the time. If you want some good energy man, just go, go back there and talk to that guy for a little while. And I'm like, so what'd you, what'd you eat for Christmas would you make? And he goes, I think that Turkey. I got it up. I put it in the blender with a little bit of oil and I flag it and chop it up, put it on sandwiches with some lessons. I gave it to my kids. I'm like, you blend fucking Turkey meat. Oh yeah man. Oh Wow. I go, what else do you put in the blender goes? Just a little bit of oil. Maybe it's good. That sounds like a, like a chicken salad type thing, right? Sounds good. And you jen, that would keep after that. I mean we have so much goddamn Turkey meat in our fridge. We got Turkey and ham meat because we did a couple of different dinners. Do you do the deep Turkey

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       now? I hear that. The way to get the way to go. You have a fryer? Yeah. You get a, like a, you could buy them where you stick the Turkey. Uh, like uh, like, like these prongs stick into it. And then he just sort of lower it into this, this Vat for like 20 minutes. Right. It's like there's a certain time per pound of bird. The bird is, but it's so good dude, because he had cook it in peanut oil and it's just juicy and delicious and crispy on the outside. It's my all time favorite way to get a Turkey. Yeah. Oh, but man, turkeys, that's all that factory farm shit is. As I get older it's freaking me out more and more. It freaks me out. Like buying chickens in the store freaks me out because of the way you know they were treated or a hundred percent.

Speaker 5:          00:27:29       Yeah. Yeah. Chickens for the. That's the big one. That freaks me out because there's something like chickens and pigs because there's something that we do with chickens where you would. You can't really do with a cow. We stack them on top of each other. Just smoosh them all into these places where they can't even fucking move. They just stuck there and then they wait until they get to a certain size and then they kill them and it's like, oof. What does that mean? They're like a. it's like they're a human or not human. A living organism that's, that's a battery, like a power supplies. They doing it. The pumping them full of chemicals that make them get fatter and big. I don't know. I know they definitely have used chemicals on the birds, I'm sure, but I don't know if they use on them on them all the time.

Speaker 5:          00:28:15       I think the thing that's going on with those birds is genetic selection. Yeah. Where they've just genetically made certain birds breed with certain birds. They've established this gene does, uh, this, uh, genetic selection where they're just like super fucking plump and like ridiculously big breasts and then they get those to do that in a very short period of time. And then they kill them and they can't walk because their chests are so big. They fall over forward. Yeah. Well it's like what they did with bulldogs, like how the fuck did they make a bulldog out of a wolf? Yeah. How'd they do? Who knows? That's why they can't fucking breathe. Yeah. Yeah. Pugs. So sad. It's so sad. That was a wolf and they made, they made the face smaller because they wanted it to be cuter. Acute, a cute dogs having a fucking asthma attack his entire life to the house. Two ranges that you have at the chickens and I think the only criteria for the chicken pen is that the chicken has to be able to turn around in it. That's it. That's how big it has to be. That's so crazy and they're getting shit on by all the chickens above it their whole life. Jesus Christ. Yeah, I know. Is that really how it works? How many do they stack on top of each other? 12 for real now. I don't know, but a lot. Say 100. One went crazy. One hundred. One hundred floors and chicken.

Speaker 5:          00:29:41       That noise

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       around that is placed on. Right, but that's like taking an organism and using it as cells in a battery. It really is. It's like you're taking like these chickens and you're literally compartmentalizing it into a specific size, like a cell and the Mitochondria of the cell is this chicken and you've got hundreds and hundreds of them stacked into this place and they're like these living organisms that you've. You've got locked into these clearly defined spaces and you're extracting energy from those chickens you're taking. You're extracting food from them. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:30:16       they're just protein. They're protein bars.

Speaker 3:          00:30:19       Yeah, I mean it is fucking bizarre. It's a bizarre practice.

Speaker 4:          00:30:24       Wow. Even when they're not in cages, they have them so smushed together, they can't even fucking move.

Speaker 3:          00:30:31       Yeah. It's not fun. They're not having a good time, but it's not the only way to raise chickens. That's the problem. I had this guy, Joel Salitan on the podcast a while back, really, really interesting guy and he runs, I think it's farm's called polyface. Polyface farm. Um, but he's into. He's got these things that he does with these chickens where he puts them in these giant like chicken houses that are on wheels and they're like, roll them into an area and then you just let them out and they run around at the end of the day, they go right back in because that's where they do. They go into their nest again, then you roll them down a hill to another place and then he has these pigs, they takes pigs and he puts a fence around the pigs, a movable fence and the pigs just stay inside that fence and eat whatever the fuck they want. And then the next day they moved the fence and they keep doing it. So he's got these animals like that, those chickens in like fucking chickens don't freak out, don't freak out when he comes near them. And this guy is like the prime example of what you would think of as like an intelligent, an intelligent take on ethical farming practices because that's, I think when

Speaker 4:          00:31:43       purdue and a lot of these houses buy from you, you have to use their cages in their feet. And they're, it's a franchise like Mcdonald's, like when you raise, when you raise livestock for a lot of these, you know, agro, these, what'd he call it? A, um, big agro. It's specific. They wanted done a certain way. And if you don't, they don't buy from you. Oh, it's very hard to be independent like that.

Speaker 3:          00:32:08       So. Oh, that's interesting. So like if you're a poultry grower, you, uh, like if you want to work for purdue, you like grow chickens for them. They don't, you don't, you don't think they grow their own chickens? Like, how's that work?

Speaker 4:          00:32:20       No, I think you get a contract with them and they, they come in and buy your stuff, but it's all got to be done. As I say, Tyson track poultry farming. Read that out there with Gregory Tyson

Speaker 3:          00:32:32       foods is one of the leading supporters of American agriculture, paying more than $15, billion annually to independent farmers supply us with cattle, hogs and chickens. We depend on more than 11,000 independent farmers across the country. This includes more than 4,000 poultry farmers who contact us to raise chickens. Now

Speaker 4:          00:32:52       that's. That's their website. It's a. it's a. it's all done with a lot of leverage and you have to do things exactly the way they want you to. I think. I think it was. Was it food inc or something that did a documentary about it?

Speaker 3:          00:33:06       I was watching this documentary today that was on dig A. I found it. It was about this guy who was like this super bad ass Sushi chef in Japan, like the best Sushi chef in Tokyo right now. I guess they were saying and it's really interesting like watching this guy acquire the, the fish and how it talks about how he ages to fish. Like I didn't know that. Did you know that when they catch tuna they'll often age them for five days and then. Yeah. And then they age a lot of times at the fish market before he takes it or he takes it back and he'll agent another five days more. So they might, you know, they might keep shit for like two weeks before you eat it to make it more tender. Wow. He's doing that with tuna. Yeah. I was watching this and I was like, wow, this is jamie and I were talking about it.

Speaker 3:          00:33:51       We were like, Whoa, what are they going to do when they kill all the fish? Like how long does it take to grow a fucking tune of that big. This guy has his tune it right. And there's sawing it with a giant Paul Bunyan saw him. It's a fucking huge to the video is really cool. And the people who made the video or like obvious like serious Sushi dorks. So they're like super amped up to be getting some Sushi from this dude, but all I could think of is like, how many fish are there? Like, how many days can we do? Like everyday they're knocking them out of the AH, the ocean.

Speaker 4:          00:34:23       Yeah. Every day. And there used to be areas where they, uh, they restricted how much fishing went on and now it's like, it's a free for all.

Speaker 3:          00:34:32       Well, under Donald Trump we're going to fix all this.

Speaker 4:          00:34:36       Thank God I've been, I've been pulled for trump's. I was a little kid. Just the concept of trump. I've always been really into. I like when I remember studying the constitution as a kid and thinking this is fucking bullshit. We need a guy who's got some balls, who's going to come in and get around all this fucking liberal bullshit. I'm just kidding. I think of the apocalypse is upon us. I really think it's over. I mean, he hasn't even taken office yet and he's already alienated China. He thinks he's friends. The best part is he thinks he's friends with Russia. That's like, that's like hanging out with the school bully. And thinking you're safe until one day you say something that bully doesn't like any fucking cracks in the face and you realize he's just a broken child.

Speaker 3:          00:35:23       How much you know way more about this than I do because I've spent the majority of my adult life ignoring almost everything about how the system works and you win. But how much power does he really have it president? Yeah. How much power does he really have in terms of decisions to be made for things like, like any sort of a military action?

Speaker 4:          00:35:47       Well, what you've already seen is, but by taking a phone call from Taiwan, a simple act that he didn't think twice about that opened up the floodgates to China saying that we are recognizing Taiwan is an independent state, which has been a. there's been a one, a one China policy going back to Nixon, which basically ensured that it put a clamp down on the cold war and it said, we're not going to keep. We're not going to keep building up against each other. And a part of that is we're going to live by certain doctrines like the one China policy and when he takes a call from Taiwan, something as simple as that. All of a sudden, China is talking about a nuclear buildup. It's that simple. It's not about what laws he enacts, it's about him as a spokesman for our country. And what messages he sends out.

Speaker 4:          00:36:35       I mean, it's like Obama did with Israel. I don't know what. I don't know why, but in his 11th hour he is soured relations with Israel to the point where, you know, um, even though he's a lame duck president on his way out, it's, it was a destructive thing. He did. I don't just, I don't know if I disagree with it. What did he do? Well, the UN had a resolution. I was saying that the, um, Israel has new developments in the, in the West Bank and which are illegal according to UN previously UN resolutions. And so, uh, I dunno what they're calling it, but it's illegal what they've done. And, and the US signed, they signed onto it. So they, they set up these settlements in Palestinian territories, what it is, well the disputed Palestinian territory and they just decided to start building their, they've been doing, they've been building there for years and they put it, they put up like 600 homes, but they're planning on putting up 5,000 in an area that, you know, pieces the, the, the, there is no peace over there. But what's keeping it from being an all out war is that area that is, that is supposed to be kept neutral for now or, and now they're building on it.

Speaker 3:          00:37:52       Why would someone want to build? Are they running out of land? They can't build other places?

Speaker 4:          00:37:57       No, they, they don't recognize uh, the Palestinians. And so they don't, they see that that's all their land still. And so they, they won't stop. They will continue building and pushing out. I mean the tide is turned on Israel from what I can tell. And I don't follow Israel very closely at all except for when I hear people yelling about it at parties that I met because I have friends that are like hardcore Zionists and I have friends that are hardcore anti Zionist and I, they're totally rational people and they can joke around about talking about fucking your mother and Blah, Blah Blah. But as soon as Israel comes up, shit gets real. And they talk,

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       you know? Um, I think the tide is turned. There's a lot more people that are seeing Israel as a terrorist state.

Speaker 2:          00:38:43       Whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:38:47       Wow. They're very aggressive net and yahoo is just a fucking. He's a bowl.

Speaker 1:          00:38:54       What's the right resolution? What's the right solution? Because what, how much is in dispute? Like how much territory? I don't know. That seems like a small place doesn't. It seemed very small. Isn't Israel like the size of Connecticut or some shit like that. Like how big is it? I don't think it's very big, but it's where it's located. So let's find out how big is Israel? Just a hotly charged subject? Yeah, it is. It's one of the most charged subjects and all of the Holocaust survivors basically. Yeah. Yeah. And you're talking about people that are right next to each other with opposing ideologies and various reasons for being righteous or villain and Iran. Iran looking at Israel erected that. I said it right, right. Is it Iran? Iran. Yeah. I was saying that they don't have a right to exist and that they're gonna throw a nuclear bomb over there.

Speaker 1:          00:39:57       What did you see? That was the guy from Pakistan who wasn't Jamie that, uh, got duped by a fake news story. Jamie Masada. No, not that guy by the. Oh yeah, I did see that in the guy got. He got duped by fake news story and you said some inflammatory shit about causing a war and all of a sudden it's like, Whoa, you guys got got all up in arms about a fake story. Yeah. Like, what in the fuck is going on? What do you think was the first fake news story? Because you go back to, you know, I'm thinking that it was an old fake news story was a

Speaker 1:          00:40:40       fake news stories. And I think probably been around for a long time. Well the Bible was a giant fake news, dare you. They did their best. They did their best to remember the stories. Find a good map. I think part of the provinces, the arguments over the maps and. Oh I see. Right, right, right. This was the one I have. Does it say like, I just want to know, like I'm too stupid to know what that is. So why don't you ask, ask Google compared to a state like, because I think there was a, there's a simple comparison. I just don't remember what it is. It's like Connecticut or something like that. Or maybe Massachusetts size comparison map Israel in USA anyway. What were we just telling you with a size comparison and fake news? Yeah, very good. New Jersey. Okay. Yeah. So it's basically the size of New Jersey and New Jersey is building a lot of homes. It looks a little bit bigger than New Jersey.

Speaker 1:          00:41:46       But look at that. It barely fits in Lake Michigan. You can stick Israel in Lake Michigan. What the fuck? How big is Lake Michigan? Holy Shit. Yeah. Isn't that insane? I know a giant ocean of water that you can surf on Lake Michigan. What's the one that's near Chicago? Lake Michigan. Lake Michigan. Um, I stayed at girl and when she was a kid her, you dated her when she was a kid? No, dude, a story she told when she was a dare you when she was a kid, she was in a, uh, a storm on Lake Michigan where they had to turn into the, into the waves, like over and over and over again all night. They were not safe like they were in danger, being capsized by the waves on a fucking lake. It's amazing. And I think it was her stepdad. I forgot who, who's steering the boat, but was just wrecked by the end of the day.

Speaker 1:          00:42:44       Like his arms were falling off. Like he, he barely could use his arms because he, like, he had to keep turning the boat all night long. They had to strap everyone down to the boat on a, on a fucking lake. Yeah. On a lake. Not the ocean. Yeah. I don't care where you put a boat in, you got what you got. Whatever's coming to you. Is that Lake Michigan? Oh my God. Look at the waves by foot waves on Lake Michigan. It says 25 foot waves on land. That's so crazy. Well, let's all that wind that comes in. It's just an immense puddle. Yeah. That used to be a fucking glacier

Speaker 1:          00:43:24       glaciers that are in some places as high as two miles high and they became all that stuff. It's nuts. Mad. I have a buddy of mine lives, uh, in Wisconsin, in the driftless area. It's like the area where the, uh, glaciers didn't hit. It's really kind of cool because it's all these hills and crazy, like a beautiful typography. The rest of the place, like a, an eraser came along. It just flattened that motherfucker out just from the weight of the glacier is pushing down on the land, the glacier just pushing for and crushing everything in its path. Literally like God's eraser. And that's when the wind whips up because there's nothing stopping that wind. Nothing. I mean, I remember driving through, I think it was North Dakota, it was North Dakota and I was driving from I think Iowa or Nebraska and North Dakota is doing a college gig and the Gig was at night and it was like a good four hour drive and they told me, look, this is a single lane road. The only, it's the only way there and it's flat as shit and it's windy out so be careful. So I'm in my rent a car and a snow snow starts as I'm and the snow

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       is just going just vertically across the road and it starts to build up. It starts to build up the snow on the road and all of a sudden I'm like halfway there and it's fucking white out conditions. All I can see is the light, the snow in my headlights ahead of me. And for a long time I was just looking at that, looking at the line on the road and following that line disappeared. Oh Shit. And I fucking freak out. And so I just pull what I think is to the side of the road because I don't know where I'm driving and I wait and all of a sudden I see headlights coming from behind me, fucking 18 wheeler barreling down, hopefully hope and he sees me. He passes me and I immediately get behind him and I rode that motherfucker for two hours to get to the school shaking, fucking shaken. And I got to the Gig and it was like these kids, it was like fucking Jesus Christ has shown up in their town. They were like,

Speaker 7:          00:45:40       this is our only entertainment all year.

Speaker 4:          00:45:43       And so we did a. We did a show in so many people came that they added a second shell, but half the kids stayed for the second show. So it was definitely one of those year material got told that night. Joe Rogan, I guarantee you that your is Don Gavin, Steve Sweeney. Todd Parker's fucking ripping every joke out of my ass. I can think of that second step. They paid me devil hilarious. And I couldn't get out of there for two days afterwards. We were, yeah. Oh my God,

Speaker 5:          00:46:14       yeah. There was so much uncertainty in the winters in Boston. There was like you weren't certain if you were going to get home. Yeah. Like I think that's right. I think that's important for people to understand that don't live in a place like that. Like if you got hit with a big January snow storm and it hit while you were at work, if you've got to work, do you. First of all, there'd be warnings everywhere. They'd be worn. They'd cancel school before the first fucking drop up. Snow fell right there. Don't freak out about like big blizzard. But if a big one hit and you fucked up and you weren't paying attention, you could get stuck wherever the fuck you are.

Speaker 4:          00:46:50       Yeah. Highways just stopped for days. Yep.

Speaker 5:          00:46:53       It takes forever for them to chew all that snow way and if it stays cold in Boston it will stay cold for a long fucking time. We remember those black piles of ice ice that had just gotten road grime and exhaust on it, but it was too cold for it to melt, so we just push that shit to the side. It would narrow the fucking highway.

Speaker 4:          00:47:13       Yeah, right. Yeah. They'd get out there with those, uh, those trucks throwing the salt and the sand down. I mean they be out there before the snow had started. They were laying down. Salt

Speaker 5:          00:47:22       did. That was why if you've got an old car, you wanted to get a California car where they didn't, they didn't use salt on the. If you've got an old car in Boston, the fucking fenders were all rotted out. Everything rotted it out because of all that salt. And they constantly re up the, uh, the highways. Oh yeah, that's right. It's just chewing through it. But isn't that kind of the only way to ensure that shit's gonna Melt? You kinda have to salt. Yup. Salt it and say. I think they sand it more than they salt it now. They probably are, you know where they get this? They get the salt from like on these giant fucking barges from South America. Salt wars, like the old days. Is that right? No, but imagine they used to go to war for salt. How you mean like way, way back salt.

Speaker 5:          00:48:06       It's amazing that we give it away for free because if you really think of what it was worth like five, 600 years ago, it was incredibly valuable. Right? Why? Because food was so bland. No To preserve food. Uh, they didn't have refrigeration, so like their meat, if you cover the outside of it with salt, the bacteria can eat the meat and it slows the decaying process. You could dry things out and salt them and as a way to preserve food, like an important way to preserve food. I think, you know, I don't know how long you get to have a piece of meat and just cover it with salt and leave it laying around at room temperature, but I think it's a lot more than it would if you didn't have the salt. And I think, uh, it's one of the reasons why it was.

Speaker 5:          00:48:49       I mean it was one of the most valuable things in the world at one point in time, which is crazy now when you think about it. Yeah. And everything you ate must've had salty a shit. People must just get used to that. Taste is salt. Do you remember when everybody was thinking that salt causes high blood pressure and then it doesn't? Oh No, it's a mineral. Yeah. I mean it's like you're not supposed to have too much of it, but like that's not what's wrong. Like what else is going on? And then there was this study that came out recently, a paper that came out recently that was pointing to the sugar industry, accepting bribes or giving bribes to scientists in the 1950. Just do that to, to push the blame away from sugar and saturated fat. The amount of heart disease that it causes, no sugar is.

Speaker 5:          00:49:39       It has become the new salt. It's become the new cholesterol. It's become the new everything. It's everybody's saying is fear. Yeah. It's everybody's fear now. Wha Wha. How do salt and sugar prevent microbial spoilage says they use sugar and salt. That's the name way to Cerner to. Hmm. Interesting. Well, it tastes better that way probably. Yeah. Okay, so it says protection of foods from microbial spoilage, using salt, usually sodium chloride or sugar. Usually sucrose has ancient roots and is often referred to assaulting salt. Curing corning or sugar curing pieces of rock salt used for curing are sometimes called corns, hence the name. Corned beef was wonder why they call it the corned. No Shit.

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       That's what it does. Fascinating. Okay. Where's it shut? I'm sorry. What does it say? Where it goes several ways here. Oh,

Speaker 5:          00:50:38       okay. There's several ways in which salt and sugar inhibit microbial growth. Most notable is simple osmosis or dehydration, salt or sugar, whether in solid or equias form. Attempts to reach equilibrium with the salt or sugar content of the food product with which it is in contact. This has the effect of drawing available water from within the food to the outside and inserting salt or sugar molecules into the food interior. The result is a reduction of the so called water activity measure of unbound free water molecules in the food that is necessary for microbial survival and growth. That is fucking fast.

Speaker 4:          00:51:21       Yeah, it is. I never thought about how because I was think about when I put salt on my food. It seems like, especially with seesaw where they would sit there so big, the particles that you don't just get like that, it doesn't spread, but they would eat the food, like say you put it in your mashed potatoes, right? It spreads really evenly throughout the mashed potatoes that it realizes all that chemical reactions going on between all the cells in the potatoes and the salt. It's kind. It's flowing back and forth. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:51:51       Yeah. I mean think about how difficult it must have been to get fresh food to a city in 1700. Throwing salt on everything and packing things in salt and taking them down the road on the back of wagons, being pulled by horses

Speaker 4:          00:52:09       with Ms Dot added control mosquitoes and flies on everything that was for so long. How people lived for so long. Open wagons, there was no like air tight compartments. No, I mean I bet kings that's a pretty dope compartments. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:52:28       Like in game of thrones, those like sitting there like just chill and how long is this ride? The horses are pulling the wagon along that fan themselves and shit that hadn't happened to. It was like the real pimps, like if you were a dude, you could pick a checkup and take her to the back of the the carriage. She'd be like, Oh my God. You have your own character? Yeah. Yeah. Baby carriage. And you have hepatitis this. Did they have hepatitis back then? Was Him the first VD came into play?

Speaker 4:          00:52:58       Well, syphilis was probably the first one I read about it in the Bible. Really? Yeah. Syphilis was all over the place. I think, uh, you know, they call it. I think they call it syphilis. Really, didn't I? I'm looking at the clap, I think. I think syphilis is the clap.

Speaker 5:          00:53:15       Like how do you think that? Do you think that happens in animals? Do you think animals give each other. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:53:20       I haven't thought about that. My friends got a herpes blister, but it busts

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       out like every couple months. She just showed me this morning, come on, give me a kiss. Things the size of a dime. Was it on her lip? Yeah, I used to get those. It's such a shame because she's beautiful. She changed her diet. Is that Koalas have chlamydia or do they are known for having.

Speaker 5:          00:53:41       What do you. Why do you say it? Looking at me like it doesn't count if it's a stuffed animal.

Speaker 1:          00:53:50       No, no. They all have it, but it's like a. it's a thing I thought I heard like they spread stds. Well, it looks good. Article Says Koala,

Speaker 5:          00:53:58       chlamydia, the std threatening and Australian icon. Didn't aids come from a monkey or is that A. is that a myth that man, I wish I could remember exactly how to answer this because I listened to a radio lab podcast called patient zero, I think it was. That was all about this. They were trying to figure out who was the first person that contracted the HIV virus and it did have something to do with someone who was tending to meet that he had killed of a chimpanzee and maybe perhaps had an open cut. Yeah. That was one of the speculations, which of course turned into somebody fucked up monkey. That's just the American translation of facts. It's fucking natural one with people. Awesome dude. Fuck the monkey. How else do you get an std? From a monkey, you gotta fucking see that Chappelle bit. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Chappelle had one of the funniest bits of all time. He goes, do you know how hard it would be to fuck a monkey? Once he said it, I was like, I never even thought of that. Imagine the battle right there. You would have to go through to actually fuck a monkey. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:11       How do you just think it's a given? Like, you know, hey, I'm going to have some dry days. I'll go, fuck a monkey, dude. Not so easy. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:55:19       I've. I do a bit of my act. That's true about my cat biting me in the hand and me getting pissed at him. I'm like, what the fuck dude? And he's looking at me and his ears are pulled back. Like that's a cat is. That's a fucking powerful little animal, but it's nothing compared to a monkey. Monkeys throw themselves through the air. Oh yeah. Little tiny body swings itself to the or catches itself, throws his to the lab. They can do ridiculous shit with their bodies and you got to think they get a hold of you. If that thing bites your face, if it gets a hold of your neck, it might look a little, you know, especially if it's a champ, like oh, like a little baby champ we had on the set of news radio and it was like a two year old chimp and this thing slapped me in my back. Like dude, it Kinda like when you let them climb on, you kind of does whatever he wants because he's a baby. He wasn't trying to hurt me, but first of all he felt like he was made out of corrugated, would just like, it was like a wooden animal, like his. He might've been like this, like you could kind

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       of pick them up and carry him, but he felt like nothing, like a person feels like nothing. It was just solid muscle and he just slapped me on the back and all I could think of is like a big one of these appeal, full grown one of these things and they get a great shit around people. When we were down in A. we're in South Africa and Cape Town and we were taking a walk down to the Cape of good, no Cape of whatever at the tip, the very tip of South Africa and is a field that you walked through with the path and the deranged is came up to us and my son was about maybe about three years old and they said to us, yeah, you're gonna. You're gonna. Want to hold him the whole time? And we're like, why? They're like chimps. Chimps will take them. They'll just come down and grab them. Yeah. They'll steal your kid and he. Yeah. Yeah. That's real. Can you imagine that? You go on a trip with your kid, he come back with no kid and you watched your kid get taken.

Speaker 1:          00:57:21       Fuck, fuck. Where's your son? Baboons to there. Another animal will do the same thing. Yeah. They'll go after it. You know what I might be thinking of baboons. Oh, that makes more. I think it was bare bones. It makes more sense, but there have been stories of chimps doing it too. Yeah. Look, man. Well, who's the woman? I got a face bitten off by a chance of people, but the one woman who was a most recently, her friend had this pet chimp and she was given xanax and wine and maybe sucking stuff. Why did he xanax? If if she's sucking his Dick, what the hell's he need? Could you imagine being so fucking crazy then? Not only do you have a 200 pound ship living with Xanax?

Speaker 1:          00:58:04       Do you think she gave it the Xanax so that he'd be more pliable? I think she was just banging this monkey. I think she live with this monkey and she was banging it. I really, really think that because I shouldn't say monkey. It's a champ. Whatever. She was living with this chimp and banging it and so her friend came over. There was a chip. Chip used to dress up. That's inhuman. He was fucking late. Yep. That was the lady. No Way. That was his girlfriend man. Who Do you think initiated? The first time she got a pet chimp. She raised it. It's a boy. It's got a dick. She's like, look, this is my new body guard, and she's got this chip and she has a couple of glasses of red wine that shipped, wants a fucker. He's, she's like, who? Who's gonna know, she lets that chimp fucker a couple times and then he keeps swinging dick or way and that's his girlfriend now and this lady came over and she interrupted his fun time. She was, she was cock blocking and he didn't take too kindly to it. So he did chimps shit to her. Just ripped her apart. Yeah. Tour faceoff. They bite your fingers off. He's huge. He was 200 pounds. Gets big. Overfed chimpanzee. Super ridiculous. Ungodly strong. No foreplay. Oh, he wanted to fuck you got fucked. Get fucked.

Speaker 5:          00:59:23       You get out of the shower. Naked bubble is going to fuck you. You have your period. Forget it. Try to keep that chip off eye. You're menstruating. A police officer who responded to the scene of the attack shot and killed travis when he clawed, opened the cops cruiser door and flashed his bloody teeth. Oh my God, Dude. He opened the fucking door. The cop was shooting it as it was pulling the door open, flashing it's bloody teeth looking at, tear him apart to holy fuck, holy fuck. Imagine if that was you and you didn't have a gun and you weren't a cop. He just pulled up and you saw some chimp tearing apart a lady and you're like, what the fuck? And the chimp just scores running towards you and decides he's going to open up your fucking door now. And he's flashing his bloody teeth after just ate some lady's face.

Speaker 5:          01:00:16       Fuck man. Where was this? I love this part. Investigators later speculated that a dose of Xanax caused the chimp to go preserve a look at that face. Looks like now. Oh my God. Her face transplant was being rejected. Oh my gosh. Surgery. Does that mean like she's going out to meet guys and she's being rejected? No, her body rejects face transplants. Any kind of transplants are notoriously tricky. Apparently. Poor Lady. God said, wait, where's it say that she was fucking him? Um, that's mine part. I added the. Oh, oh, I thought you were serious. I don't know what they're doing.

Speaker 5:          01:01:02       I mean, it's totally plausible, it's completely plausible, but I absolutely made it up for regarded as her son. Okay. Maybe she didn't fuck it. Do you think a woman could get pregnant from a monkey? Depends on the woman. Depends on the monkey. Yeah. Some super smart monkey and really stupid person who knows. Yeah. No, there's some hybrids, right? That uh, that wind up being viable. That's all like new species get developed sometimes, but most of the time it doesn't like a lagger, but they can't make babies. You know, they can, you can make a baby lion and a tiger can breed and make a baby, but that baby can make babies. So I wonder man, like what was it, if you believe in evolution, of course. What was it in history like? What was it like when there was a bunch of different species of humans because they think there's a bunch now they've documented how many have documented now because they keep finding new ones. Like they found some new one in Russia recently. Oh, by the way, all the people that, uh, that tweeted at me and sent me messages that have fucked up and said, facility Lowman Chenko is Russian. He's actually from the Ukraine. I apologize. I am a retarded American. Who? Anybody who's over there in that spot who talks like that? I go, that's how the Russian dude. Yeah, but

Speaker 1:          01:02:19       that I understand that people would think. Doesn't that give you an out? No, because I had a buddy of mine growing up who's Ukrainian. He always regarded himself as Ukrainian. He never thought of himself as Russian. So I get it. I get it. It's like if we were America, North America, Canada, and in Mexico, we're all just one thing. Oh, you're from that spot. No, no, no. I'm from America, motherfucker. Yeah, I'm from this spot, bitch. Well, as far as the cave men go. Yeah. They didn't used to think that neanderthal man and sapient's existed at the same time. Like when you look at a timeline of cave [inaudible], they make it seem like one ended in the, one just fucking started, like in a year, you know, 3000 bc all sudden they just changed 3000 BC, 20,000 BC. How? I think it was a lot more than that.

Speaker 1:          01:03:07       I think when they're talking about people living alongside Neanderthal, I think they're talking about like 40 or 50,000 years ago. Yeah. So there was, like you said, they coexisted and they say that the fights, because neanderthal man was a fucking beast. Totally different kind of person. Totally different than sap and came along and sapient was much smarter and that's the only way he was the one that survived over neanderthal would show me that again, they were able to, they were able to out hunting out kill or we fucked them all and then we interbreed with them. That probably might have happened to you. What does it say, Jamie? It says a guy is trying to make a hybrid between a chimp. Nineteen, 24. Whoa. Let me guess. German, a wild group of 13 female chimpanzees to bring back to primary research facility. It's a sucky me. The female chimpanzees were repeatedly injected with human male sperm, but none became pregnant. It was rumored that Ivonne have used his own sperm or that of his son, but few people believe on. Can we come downstairs for a minute? Well, where else is he going to get come? You try to go for a hard to get come.

Speaker 8:          01:04:19       He tried to get a female volunteers to get injected with a male chimpanzees and how many did it rumored that it only happened once, but apparently he got arrested and sent away to work in a veterinary station and stand and died two years later. But note, no pregnancy actually happened, but maybe he actually did do it. Who knows?

Speaker 1:          01:04:40       The rumor was the pregnancy actually did happen. Did Not deny.

Speaker 8:          01:04:44       There's a rumor that he did actually inject a woman with sperm.

Speaker 1:          01:04:48       This story, the story of this was like the beginning of like some crazy superhero x men type. Yeah, we'll have some new, some new. Uh, instead of Wolverine, some man champ, some hybrid like wolverine looked like he was kind of a man champ. Hybrid. Real Wolverine. Like from the comic books, he was hairy looking half human looking person. Well, the Nazis did all kinds of shit like that. Yeah. Taking heads off one animal and trying to put them on other

Speaker 4:          01:05:17       animals.

Speaker 5:          01:05:20       But how many find this out, Jamie? Find out when did human beings and the endo talls coexist. How long ago was that? Or how about this? How long ago did neanderthals go extinct? Because that's what would tell us a lot. If you had to guess, what are you going to get Craig? I'd say yeah. 20,000 sounds bonus. Say for. Oh, I was right. Neanderthals went extinct in Europe about 40,000 years ago. Giving them millennia to coexist with modern humans culturally and sexually. New findings suggest the research also suggests that modern humans did not cause neanderthals to rapidly go extinct. As some researchers have previously suggested they killed the. Yeah. There was a lot of people that did. There was one guy that had a crazy fucking theory. That's probably absolutely not true, but his theory was that they didn't look like people. His theory, we don't know what their soft tissue looked like. So his tea, he had this idea of a really intelligent apelike creature because he compared what do you remember? That whole guy, his whole thing, he made like an animated video of what it looked like. It was terrifying, like gorilla looking thing. It's like heavily muscled because they were only like five, two or five three, but they were like 205 pounds with giant boulders, sized bones in their body. They had way different bone structure than we do. And they were supposed to be like freakishly strong. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:06:51       But I think they were sorta like on all fours and standing upright, but then really sapiens stood upright. Is that true? I think so. I know there was a difference in the way they moved that uh, the sapiens were faster but they weren't as strong. So if they got into any kind of a battle, they were fucking dead. Right? Hmm. That's interesting. Yes. I read sapiens.

Speaker 5:          01:07:14       Yeah. This is what they absolutely think that they looked like the neanderthals looked like, but there was a guy had some crazy alternative theory that was probably horseshit that I want to focus on. Probably totally fake, but it was like his theories, like what if she would have neanderthal, didn't look anything like us. Like what if deanna tall like had gorilla like skin and was just just hooking scary looking fanged up, you know, jacked humanoid kind of ape. Yeah. Who knows, man. There was definitely like a bunch of different kinds of people though. They keep

Speaker 4:          01:07:54       did more, more and more evidence of new teeth and shit. Right. But the evolution was so slow. Like we think about things. The way evolution happens for us today is technological. So we see shit happened from decade to decade. Oh yeah. The end. It's all profile was super predator. So in this video, when you're looking at the end, it's all, he's got like gorilla look

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       and scan or these big crazy eyes and it's a terrifying looking beast as opposed to the way we always project them and he bases it on like the shape of their head and like what, what a gorilla's head longer jaw mean. It's crazy like you. Cause we don't know what their soft tissue looks like, but if you give them a gorilla nose instead of a human nose, they look way fucking scarier. And his argument was like, we have no idea what their nose look like. Why are we giving them a human nose? I wonder if that flies. I wonder if anthropologists are getting angry right now. There were some vicious motherfucker. Look at the way that thing looked, if that's what it looked like.

Speaker 4:          01:08:54       Like what the fuck? I know he looks up right now though. I guess they were. They were partly on all fours. Ended up right. I think they were upright. I think I'm pretty sure neanderthals were completely upright. Oh No. Yeah. Yeah. Because they were a type of human. Yeah. They just weren't Homo Sapiens, right? Yeah. So I'm so stupid to have these conversations. I'm so stupid because I read an entire book about sapiens and this whole transformation and I just. The problem is I read when I go to sleep and I don't. I'm so fucking tired. Right. It all goes through me the next night. I can't even find out. I can't even find where I left off on the book is in reading at night, like the best way to fucking fall asleep. Oh yeah. It makes you go to sleep so much easier. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:09:34       Like something about reading. I'm just conk dude. My wife opens up our book at night every night and she, she does not get to the second page and she's sitting upright and I can hear her breathing change and she's asleep. Wow. I can't. I take a sleeping pill every night. Take Asleep. Taking a Lunesta and the side effects. I think a loss of memory. I think that's what it is. I'm taking the sleep pill and then I'm reading and uh, nothing sticks. But otherwise I can't sleep. My mother and brothers, same way. We cannot sleep, we just our minds fucking race and I'll lay there for hours and nothing happened. So I, I'd rather be a little groggy in the morning then then be exhausted in five. Have you tried any kind of meditation or anything to calm your mind for you when you started meditating? But I've, I only started meditating like two years ago and I've been taking the sleeping pills for probably like four, so I should try to get off of him. It's stupid, but I think if you get off those things, that's where it gets hairy. Really? Yeah. So if you start going crazy, call me up so I know, I'll know.

Speaker 5:          01:10:43       Just say just say, Hey, I tried going off these fucking sleeping pills. I'm like okay, Gotcha. Failure.

Speaker 4:          01:10:49       No, I need you to do my 10:20 spot at the laugh factory tonight. I think

Speaker 5:          01:10:54       when you get off those things like sleeping pills, they have a real bizarre reaction some people have to them or they'll do things and wake up in the middle of doing them, driving down the highway in a shootout with the cops. Like that kind of Shit, like you wake up in the middle of an act going, what the fuck am I saying? Why you're on sleeping while you're on certain

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       sleeping pills. He, Ambien is crazy. Like I ran out and I took a friend's ambien recently and I had the most insane dreams. Oh, I've heard. I'm terrified of that stuff. Yeah, I know a lot of people who love that stuff. I Dunno why Ambien is prescribed. It's the same thing with opioids. It's like, why are they still prescribing this shit when it's so addictive and so dangerous? Because people want to be able to make their own choices. You know? And if you could go to a doctor, if you're informed correctly and you go to a doctor and you go, look, I don't give a fuck what they say. I want a fucking ambient. I know it's not good for you. I know it's bad for my sleep. I don't give a fuck. I need to go to sleep. If you're a grown adult, I feel you should be able to make that decision.

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       You can. How come you can make that decision? And drank a fucking bottle of, uh, of um, Ron White's tequila a night if you so choose to. Why can't you decide to take an ambient? It's true. Is it, is it really worse than getting hammered and everybody gets hammered and there's a lot of people getting hammered. Well, it just seems like with all the options, like I know with Lunesta I don't have these side effects. Oh really? Yeah. I mean, no, it's, there's no side effects with luminess. I'm not a paid spokesman for Lunesta by the way, but I just found that I did take ambien and it was crazy. It was like tripping. So lunesta does it for you. Lunesta works. Joe Lunesta works for me. Have you ever done anything like Melatonin or have you tried like a Melatonin? Melatonin works. It's good, does it?

Speaker 1:          01:12:43       Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Why don't you just try that then? Since it's a natural migration, we like to get addicted to things. I put the booze. So now I drink. And what is this shit you gave me? Caveman coffee, man. It's got a nice little kick. It's got a hell of a kick. It's got a hell of a kick to it is. It's kind of mainly because it doesn't taste that good. Right, right. Well, it's like black coffee. Yeah, exactly. Like when I say it doesn't taste that good. I mean it doesn't taste like a Caramel Macchiato, you know? That's, that tastes good. That's what every slurpee like this is delicious, but it's full of sugar. This tastes like a. we're calling it like a Guinness. Guinness have coffee. It's got this weird sort of acquired taste for a little fuzziness to it, which is nice. Nitrogenated.

Speaker 1:          01:13:30       I don't know why. I don't know if it works. More gifts. You're more fucked up. I don't know, but it's got 270 milligrams caffeine. Yeah. I'm a caffeine freak. I drink a lot of caffeine. Yeah, but that one's manageable. Does caffeine never really derails your judgment to manageable addiction? If he got to like a legit addiction, caffeine is not a bad one. Yeah. That's, that's one you can kind of. You could skate by with that one. Cigarettes is going to get. Yeah. That's the one that's gonna get you cigarettes. Probably the worst thing you can be addicted to then heroin, it seems like pills might be worse than cigarettes because you can make rational decisions when you're on cigarettes. The problem is though, the health consequences of cigarettes or almost

Speaker 9:          01:14:12       inescapable. We've just made an irrational decision if you're lighting a cigarette. Yeah, so it's got you in a point of addiction where you are literally killing yourself

Speaker 5:          01:14:21       slowly. It's kind of amazing that it's still around. It's amazing really. But again, I'm 100 percent in favor of people doing whatever the fuck they want to do. If you were informed and you go, I don't give a shit, I want a fucking cigarette, you should be able to do it. So by that hand, if you could do that with booze, if you could do that. When we. I think freedom is best. It's best to have people figure it out on their own. It's best to decide for people what they can and can't do.

Speaker 9:          01:14:49       Good. I think it's the same with raising a kid. You know, I try to give my kids a lot of free freedom, you know? I informed them, I reign them in, I try to shepherd them, but I don't ride them, you know, and when they make mistakes I don't, I don't overly punish, I just try to. I tell them I'm disappointed and that means a lot to them, but I think that, you know, the, this year your kids are, they need to internalize responsibility and the earlier they do it the better because then the process of internalizing responsibility should start as in in whatever ways you can parcel it out from a young age. That's how you got to do it because by the time they move out, you know, it's like you're not going to be there to make these decisions for them.

Speaker 5:          01:15:36       Yeah. The, the, the task of raising human is probably one of the most important things. One of the most impossible to correct. Once you fucked it up and it's put in the hands of everybody who is most likely raised incorrectly themselves.

Speaker 9:          01:15:54       Well, the hope is, is more therapy than there was today. There's more literature, there's more studies and I do think we're more informed about what we do. I think we're more vigilant about it. I think men, the fact that I just said that to another man that wouldn't have happened 25 years ago, no guy would talk about parenting in any deep way to another man.

Speaker 5:          01:16:13       No, it was kinda almost gay.

Speaker 9:          01:16:16       Yeah, it was. It was not, it was not your role to do that. And now pay parents. It's a partnership, the mother and the father because the worst thing, and I know a couple that's like this where they're never on the same page and their kids are all fucked up and neither one of them is a bad parent. They're just doing it in opposite ways, ways. What's the. He's very like, you know, uh, checked out in some ways, but like in the way, not in a healthy way, I describe the hands off is still caring and controlling and supporting his is a little bit more, a little bit more like I can't handle this. Hers is, she's super eight type personality and she's trying to drive the kids to be, you know, the best, their best potential, which is good. A little bit of that is good. And little bit of what he's doing is good, but they're both polar opposites and not really their strategies

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       will either. But I,

Speaker 9:          01:17:12       I really think that the, the main thing is that your kids can't feel like they're getting two different messages at the same time.

Speaker 5:          01:17:18       Time for Mommy and daddy can't feel like they're being smothered either. Right? You know, one of the things about kids that you find out real early, if you tell them not to do something, that's what they want to do. They don't want you telling them what to do because they're little people. Even though they might be five or six, there's still little people and people don't like you telling them what to do. You got to explain to them, it's much better to explain to them why it's important that you do the thing that you don't want to do and why it's a good thing. You've got to change the way you think about it. Don't think about it like, Oh, it's this chore. Think about it. Like, this is just a thing that I have to do right now and I'm so lucky in so many ways and that's how I should look at life and that jumped on. Don't just get annoyed at things. You know, you don't want to go to bed, go to bed, you got to get sleep. I know you don't want to go to bed. I get it. I feel the same way all the time. But as a person who's in charge of your biology, I know that you're not quite wise enough to make the decisions. You want to be healthy. Your little kids need to get like 10 to 12 hours sleep.

Speaker 9:          01:18:22       How do you get to tell them? Give them the association that they're making choices and that their choices have ramifications. You're going to wake up to you that sometimes it's hard for me to wake you up and it hurts in the morning. Will they won't be that way. If you go to sleep now, you'll wake up and you'll feel good.

Speaker 5:          01:18:37       Yeah, that's man. That is the fucking biggest difference when, when I had day jobs and um, you know, a lot of times I was a, like for years I had sleep deprivation because I was getting up in the morning for delivering the newspapers and it was trying to go back to sleep, but I always stayed up at night because I was doing stand up and like for the longest time, like I was really screwed up. And then once I quit doing that, once I just started doing, just stand up and I started getting sleep. Like I go to bed after the clubs and I would get up at 11, wake up and I felt so good. I was like, oh my God. Like, everything feels great. Like I don't feel like I'm constantly at a lack. That feeling that you have when you're tired all the time. When you work too many hours you don't get enough sleep because that fucking feeling like you're always at a lack. There's always like a hole in your, your, your biological game as it were. I'm just, ugh. Just trying to be left alone. Yeah, just, you just don't. But if you can get that solid eight to 10 hours sleep, that goes away, especially if you can get 10, but he could only get eight. It's worth so much, you know? Yeah. So fucking value through it.

Speaker 9:          01:19:50       Throw a 20 minute meditation on top of that. The next day around 2:30 in the afternoon when you're crashing out after lunch

Speaker 5:          01:19:57       if you can do that. That's a good move. Yeah. If you could just sit down. I mean the meditation, just the, the, the word meditation is so loaded you because it has

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       that. There's a sort of like A. Oh, a lot of us I think have this idea about people meditate is like, ah, you know, he's just trying to find some spiritual peace and this is like some masturbatory weirdness and you stand in front of fucking incense and pretend you're from a different culture. But I think that just being alone with your thoughts and just your thoughts and just concentrating on just thinking about as little as possible was just thinking maybe even just about breathing. I'm breathing in and breathing out. Just that alone is a form of meditation.

Speaker 9:          01:20:42       Yeah. I mean, it's like it's, it's a guided sleep. Think of it as taking a nap. You know, Eckhart tolle talks about, you know, with, with meditation, it's just really, it's reminding you to not think about the past to the future for a little while. It's about just thinking about the breathing that's happening right now or the mantra that's happening right now and when you come out of it, you're not going to stay in that state all day, but you will have brought yourself back to that point if only for 20 minutes and that will sort of, that will guide you for the rest of the day.

Speaker 3:          01:21:12       Yeah. I think the momentum of most people's lives is so strong. Mine included, I'm sure yours included that are oftentimes you just get caught up in how you're thinking or how you're behaving or what you're doing. You just get caught up in it. Like it's just like, wow. It's like pushing you from behind and if you can just stop as often as possible and do nothing for an hour and breathe, just do nothing but think and breathe. You come out of it with a more balanced perspective.

Speaker 9:          01:21:45       You make better decisions. You're not reacting to things

Speaker 3:          01:21:48       exactly. You're not. You're not being pushed from behind by the momentum of everything you've experienced over the last x amount of months. You get a fresh restart to contemplate your existence. Well, you know, we can't do anything about the past, but here's where we are right now and this is what we. Okay. Now I've decided that instead of concentrating on that, I'm going to concentrate on this and it give yourself like a chance to almost give yourself a little personal seminar. Give yourself a little garlic will. Okay. Are you happy about this? Like, like if you were giving yourself advice, he'd probably be way different than what you actually do. You know, I've always thought that if I was giving myself advice, like how, what, how brutal would I be with myself? Honest, would I be with myself?

Speaker 9:          01:22:30       Well, that's why you're supposed to set goals, because goals are you sitting down in a cold calculating way and saying, where do I want to be in a year? What are the steps that I need to get to that and then setting small goals to get you there because day to day you're reacting to people are codependent with their wives or their kids instead of reacting to that. You're wondering if your phone's going to ring. You're wondering what people are saying on social media. There's so many dynamics that have you spinning around and not in your own space. So that said, that's what I love the beginning of the year. I love sitting down and setting up some new goals. I mean, you and I just talked a couple of nights ago

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       about that. Like your goal is to sort of try to not get off social media more. Not Answer your phone all day. Mine cast, stay off my phone for many, many hours at a time. Yeah, that's the big one. And I'm just thinking about the amount of time that I spend. Just looking for something interesting. Looking on twitter feed, looking on facebook or on, um, instagram. Just looking for something interesting. I'm going to just fluttering through fucking pictures of Shit. Oh look, another car all. Look at that lion. That's crazy. After awhile, chimpanzee attacking a car. Well, that video that I showed you today, that's how I found it. The fucking lady that hit that, or the guy that hit that moves. I don't know if the guy or girl, whoever the fucking hit that moves, but I'm inundated by that and people keep sending me these fucking videos of these Russian crazy like acrobats doing flips on the top of buildings. You've seen those guys daredevils, these Russian daredevil characters. They go on the top of buildings and do like handstands and glean their feet off the edge. You can't watch it, man. It's hard to watch. It's too fucking scary. I mean it's fucking terrifying and some of them get up on top of him with those hoverboards, those little wheely boards and they'd go like to the edge and that. That makes me uncomfortable. You just describing it and they spin around. Who's the skyscraper? Look at this.

Speaker 1:          01:24:26       This is in Russia. This. I don't know where this one is, but they're. Do they do these all over the place? I think this is Dubai. This guy is on the fucking edge of a crazy skyscraper. Like, what is that? 100 stories. High holy days doing a handstand. Oh, came down backwards. Oh, that was terrifying. What do you. What do you do after that? I just hurt my elbow reacting to that. I whacked my phone. That's hilarious. This guy's got a helmet on and his underwear and he's walking on a bar. Oh my God. That is so crazy. These kids are fucking nuts, man. Jesus Christ. This guy's doing a balance beam over a. It looks like a harbor. I don't know how far down it is, but he's way the fuck up on some criminal oil rig and looked like. Oh my goodness.

Speaker 10:         01:25:29       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:25:32       uh. Yeah. A, I'm, I think I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I used to do crazy shit. My friend, my friend lived on the fifth floor of and apart building and there's a picture of me when I was about 14 hanging off his balcony by my knees. Oh my God, I will. I was into gymnastics. I did gymnastics pretty hard for like six years. So I would hang off anything I would do, I would do flips off fucking anything anywhere. Yeah. Dude, I got sweaty hands. Just looking at that. I do too. Sweaty hands. Don't show this

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       Jamie. God Damn it. That guy jumped off the roof into a pool. I mean, how many stories is six stories to shut this off? I can't do this anymore. Oh my hands are fucking sweaty, man. There's like soaking wet. Feel them feel Jesus wet, soaking wet. I'm. Hey, can I plug some dates? Come on everybody. I got my big winter, a comedy tour coming up. I'm coming to your town, Tacoma, Washington. February ninth and 11th. So everybody knows where to get all the dog.com for tickets. Portland, Oregon, a February 16 through 18, Oklahoma City one night. Uh, February Twenty First Austin, Texas February 22nd to 25th, Fort Lauderdale and March Burlington, Vermont in March. Houston in March. Uh, check it all out at Greg Fitz show and uh, fits dog radio. It's it the Irvine Improv, the new Irvine Improv is fucking awesome dude. Right? Giant. I did it once and uh, I just remember I didn't, uh, I didn't fill it.

Speaker 4:          01:27:12       I'll tell you that by no means that I feel it is a very big place. Yeah. But I'm doing it then. I've got to St Patrick's Day shows, uh, which you've done I think the last three years. You've done my Saint Patrick's day show a pet, the Hollywood improv. I have to support the one quarter Irish though, man. That's right. Get in there for that. That's always a fun show though, isn't it? Pack it out. We get all Irish comics on it. Throw a black guy in there just to keep it. Keep the fucking pc police off my back. Get Ian Edwards on there. Yeah, that's a fun show, man. Yeah, it's good. Joey Diaz. I did a one year and it was um, it was all the cool comics. And then Joey Diaz, he was like Zach Galifianakis, Sarah Silverman and know Andy Kindler. And they went up and they didn't know who Joey Diaz was and uh, I had him go on like second just to fucking, just to raise the bar and everybody else.

Speaker 4:          01:28:06       And he went up there and he's doing this whole bit about having some chick piss in his mouth in a bathtub and I'm drinking it like a soldier and uh, and the place they don't know what to make of him. At first it takes some, it takes them like a good two minutes for them to just pick their jaws up off the table, put the, put the job back in their head and then start to laugh. And then you just saw them convulsed and in the back, Sarah and all them, they're going like, who is this guy? What, what is this? I go, this is fucking Joey Diaz. They didn't know. They didn't know when. How long ago was this? Two years ago. Wow. I did not know who Joey d is, is because he doesn't work. I don't think he works the Improv. Does he have a different comic knows like you hear about like a guy like you always hear about. So I heard about big Jay oakerson

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       before I saw him.

Speaker 9:          01:29:03       You gotta see this guy. It's very foreign. I think maybe there's this, you know, splintered comedy world. Exact doesn't do a ton of stand up and I think, uh, you know, Sarah, Sarah works the comedy store sometimes. Sometimes. I've seen her there a few times. Not as often as she should. What are you judging? Well, she needs you. She needs that, you know, I think some comics they work, they'll work largo a lot and uh, and I think it, you can, you can draw your own crowd, but she's like a real comic. She can play in a room like the store where they didn't all come to see her and she can fucking prove something to people that maybe don't know what a good comic she is. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:29:39       Well I would agree with you that I think she's one of the best comics live. Sure. She, she killed at the comedy store last time I saw her, which was, I want to say it was quite awhile ago. It might've been a year ago, matter of fact, sometime between now and a year. Anyway, she destroyed and I was laughing really hard. There was some funny shit in there, but on the other hand, she's obviously got money and she's obviously comfortable, so she should do whatever the fuck she wants.

Speaker 9:          01:30:07       Right. I mean there's guys like Paul f Tompkins, that dude, I haven't seen him in a comedy club in 10 years, but he does his show at Largo. I don't know how often and he does. He'll go to San Francisco and fucking sellout cobb's. The guy's got his circuit. He's got his crowd. I think it makes a very nice living and I think he does the style of comedy he does, which is a little bit more storytelling. It's a little slower, a little more esoteric may not work in the other kinds of clubs. So yeah, maybe it fosters his ability to go deeper into what he's doing by playing select clubs.

Speaker 3:          01:30:42       Yeah, I mean I guess it's all in whether or not what you enjoy doing, whether it fits in with clubs. Yeah, because some people it just doesn't. Some people they don't enjoy just always being, you know, always going for the laugh always. You know like what, like our style Boston style, like Boston styles, like punchline set up, punchline set up punchline and to try to build punchlines and some people have like they, they want to tell you a story that happens to be humorous. They don't want to be confined by this idea that it has to be set up punchline set up punchline. So it is sorta stand up and a lot of ways, but in a lot of ways it's not. It's like you're, you're, you're being an orator, a narrator, you're telling stories, you know, which is cool too, you know, like there's a lot of people who like Henry Rollins is a great example.

Speaker 3:          01:31:30       You wouldn't say that necessarily. What he does is stand up. You would say it's a spoken word thing, right? But what is he doing? He's telling stories, you know, I mean they're just, they have punchlines. They have like very clear setup and punchlines that I'm, I guess obviously he knows where the funny parts are so he's kind of doing standup, but he's doing it his fucking way. Like if a lot of people really liked that is what my point is like and they don't want to go see him try to do a 15 minute set at the.

Speaker 9:          01:31:59       It can change. Like I find that if I go through a run of clubs that are bad, I'm like say Florida. It changes the way I'm doing standup because in Florida you've got. It's just a schizo side crowd. You've got rednecks mixed in with old people mixed in with Latino's mixed in with fucking spring breakers or whatever. It's never one crowd. You have no fucking idea who you're applying to. So you're up there for an hour and you're just. It's a drunk and knife fight in the alleys. You're just trying to fucking keep your spinning plates. You're trying to keep this guy happy. This guy's Hecklin, they're not paying attention. And I find that like it makes my act worse because I'm not getting in the pocket and doing what I want to do. I'm pleasing because I'm trying to survive. Right. And then you go to a club like fucking Austin Cap City and Austin, Texas and Holy Shit, man, you just kicked back and they come to you. I just did Madison, Wisconsin. They came to me.

Speaker 3:          01:33:01       Oh, madison is a really cool town. Yeah, it is really interesting. Yeah. Like super open minded. Liberal Wisconsin town. Yeah. What a great theater. There's a theater there too. What the hell is that theater there? Is it acme theater? No. Did I make that up?

Speaker 9:          01:33:17       No. Acme is in Minneapolis. It means the comedy club in Minneapolis. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:33:22       The theater in Madison or film. I don't know. I had a point, but it's fucking lost. There's an orpheum there. Maybe that's where I went.

Speaker 9:          01:33:33       Yeah. It's a great little city. It's a college town. That's where I went. Good food is really only one block though. Yes, not a lot. It's psyche. There's a block that goes from the State House to the university and there's not much often,

Speaker 3:          01:33:47       and again, it's one of those places where people that are living in a place where it gets really, really, really fucking cold theater family. That's where I was. Those people are hardier like that thing that we're talking about. Yeah. This idea that you might not make it home tonight. There's a god blizzard. You might get stuck in the side of the road and you see flashing like a light on the side of the road. Like someone's hazard lights. They pulled over like a lot of times people help because that person might die. Like there's a difference between like if you see somebody on the four, oh five and they were pulled over. Do you ever even think for a fucking second pulling over and helping them? No. No, but if you were driving down a snowy road in New Hampshire and you saw someone pull over the side of the road and you start thinking, what if that's a mom with her kids?

Speaker 9:          01:34:32       What did she think? It's great. It totally fosters community when you live in a harsher, whether you have a trust and there's like a symbiotic relationship with your neighbors and you know, I, I think that like you think about people that live up in Alaska and how they share supplies and fucking in the spring help rebuild a barn and you know that that's community that's living. I mean, in La our needs is so easily met. It just don't have any fucking. Our roof doesn't go bad because it rains three days a year and you know, you can take an uber here and you could get a fucking yelp review on the Sushi play. It's all easy. It all comes to you. There's no sense of, yeah, I don't need to help you. I, if I hang out with you, it's because I want to hang out with you there. You hang out with your neighbor because you're fucking surviving together.

Speaker 5:          01:35:17       We were all hanging out in the back of the comedy store last night and we were all stoned and we're all laughing and giggling and joking around and I was thinking, boy, like what a great place this is to be like at the sunset strip in Hollywood in 2016. And then all I could think of because of the pod probably was like, what if an asteroid, just not even a big one, but a pretty big one. Just slammed into downtown La Right now. Not enough to kill me, but enough for me to just feel the impact. See that thing flying through the sky and hear the people scream and run for the hills and realize. I realized at that moment because I was so high, I was like, how fragile is this existence that we think is so concrete. We think it's so locked in and permanent and secure and all we take is one fucking rock that comes from this guy. Boom in the downtown La. Kill a half a million people and then the rest of us at beaches, shit in our pants and terror

Speaker 9:          01:36:21       on highway goes out in la, we're fucked. Fucked because there's only two roads downtown. There's the 10 and the four. Oh five. And if those go either one of those go. The city shuts down to. This is such a stupid place to live. There was three earthquakes last night too. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:36:36       Yeah. Three earthquakes. A pretty big one on the Nevada border. Five point seven. That's a pretty big one. It's not a, you know, a one like a, the 19, 90 whatever the fuck. It was one which was a lot higher. That was more than seven, but this was a significant earthquake. Five point seven is a pretty good shock,

Speaker 9:          01:36:56       but that's what's so weird about. I mean you talk about it being tenuous and all that is that that shit can fuck things up bad and people go, oh we do, but we just elected an earthquake

Speaker 5:          01:37:08       we chose

Speaker 9:          01:37:09       was a fucking tragedy to happen. And if you're a trump supporter, go fuck yourself. You fucked us. Can I? Thanks for coming.

Speaker 5:          01:37:20       These liberals in Hollywood that think they can talk down to you, the good people of trump landia you just watch. I am not on his side. I do not support any of the statements and I think it's about time we showed a little respect for the office of Commander in chief. Maybe he will rise to the job. He could. Maybe. Maybe we can get him some mushrooms. Maybe he will have a, a revelation while he's in office that this has achieved the highest achievement than any human being can ever attain. That he has won the race and now and

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       maybe he will change his entire cabinet appointments that he's made over the last month and like Bill Gates dedicate the remaining years of his life to philanthropy work. Yes. You know, Joe, my attitude towards this year was supposed to be positive and you just saw an example of negativity come out negative. I can't do it. I can't go negative on it. I can be vigilant. I can keep an eye on what he does. My wife has this app where every day she can call or write a congressmen or a cause or a place you can donate money so that you feel like every day what's the APP called you? No, no. I'll find out. I'll find out. Jimmy could find it, but it's a way of not feeling alienated and not feeling isolated and like you're doing something whether or not it makes a difference. Maybe it does. Well if everybody reacts that way, it makes a difference.

Speaker 1:          01:38:43       It's really sheer numbers. So we have used it on as an example on the show before, but you remember when the United States had that I'm the president had the press conference where Obama was saying that we're probably going to go to war with Syria and America was like, fuck you. It was a unanimous across the board. Right. And left. So when he said that he drew a line in the sand about if they use chemical weapons, we'd go to war. Yeah. There was something along those lines. Yeah. If there was a fucking blatant rejection by the American people, it was very obvious. Very vocal and no, no commentators though, right or left. We're saying this is a good idea, like this is a terrible idea. I want to go to another fucking unwinnable war in Syria and so it stopped. Yeah. Stopped. I mean obviously it's a terrible fucking place and you know that it's terrible videos that are coming out of there every day.

Speaker 1:          01:39:32       It's a salient. It's just fucking wiped out to insane. It's insane. I don't think, I mean it's hard for us to even imagine what it would be like to be living there living over here and fucking Los Angeles where everything's perfect. Imagine what it's like to be someone who just buy a bad roll the dice. You were born over there. I've had parts of Africa, you know, south Sudan and Congo and places were places where people are giving their lives in the street because there were voted discrepancies that ideologically are, are, are letting themselves be shot in public squares because they're demonstrating. That's intense. Yeah. It's incredible. It's, I mean there's, there's pockets of the world that are living a sophisticated version of the way people were living six, 700 years. Yeah. They're just living a more sophisticated version of using cell phones and technology, but they have almost the same mindset as people who lived hundreds and hundreds of years ago for good and for bad. They found an uncontacted tribe in the Amazon. Oh, I saw that. Saw the pictures. Holy Shit. We were talking. We were trying to figure out where like imagine if there was a way where you could infiltrate those people, but they wouldn't let. You would have to. They would not. The only way to really know how they lived would be to become one of them. Like

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       you really couldn't figure out how they lived by you going in there as Greg Fitzsimmons because they would go, whoa, what the fuck is this? You have clothes, like, what's that thing on your wrist? It tells the time why. Why do you need to know what time it is? I do. It would be. It would be amazing, but you would be to affected like you would. You would affect them rather,

Speaker 9:          01:41:13       whereas I think you might kill them because very often people, people, anthropologist tried to go in there and study and they give them a disease and they wiped. They've, there's been cases where they wiped out entire tribes. Yeah. There's a guy named

Speaker 5:          01:41:26       Dan Flores who's, um, he wrote a paper about, um, the bisons and a bison diplomacy bison ecology, I think it's called. And one of the things he was talking about was the amount of native Americans that were wiped out just because of diseases by settlers. And it was some insane number, like high 80 percent. Oh, down in Mexico, that was, I don't know where it was, but what percentage of native Americans Google this, what percentage of native Americans

Speaker 11:         01:41:59       where

Speaker 5:          01:42:00       killed by diseases from European settlers,

Speaker 9:          01:42:04       because I know the Spanish, when they, when they came into Central America, they fucking so many

Speaker 5:          01:42:09       people died. Diseases. Well, he was equating it to the boom and the buffalo herd sizes. Oh No, she was saying. Yeah, he was saying that when the native Americans contacted the Europeans, they got these horses from them. Okay. What does it say here? Ninety percent. No Shit. When Europeans arrived carrying germs, which thrived on a dense semi urban populations, the indigenous people of the Americas were effectively doomed. They had never experienced smallpox, measles or flu before, and the viruses tore through the continent, killing an estimated 90 percent of native Americans.

Speaker 9:          01:42:46       Hey Shit. Holy Shit. Sent and then we went to war against the remaining 10 percent. Holy Shit. It's located them and push them around. Holy Shit. God Damn. And we wonder why they drink?

Speaker 11:         01:43:03       Well, I mean

Speaker 5:          01:43:08       the same thing that I said about those, that that tribe that lived in the jungle like I would have, I would love if there was a way where you could somehow or another be amongst them without them knowing it so you could really truly see how they behave and exist unaffected by a person like you or personally me. That obviously doesn't does it wasn't born there.

Speaker 9:          01:43:30       There was this documentary about this guy from the, from Greenwich Village, I think it was a gay guy, and he went down to this village in, might've been Columbia and he lived with them on the river for 20 years and they were gay. The tribe was not, their tribe wasn't gay, but they didn't delineate between gay sex, straight sex. It was just all kind of fluidly would happen. And so he had this boyfriend basically, but the boyfriend had a wife and kids, but he slept with the guy for 20 years and then he left and he was gone for like 15 years. I forget why he didn't go back. Um, I think he didn't go back as like, they eventually attacked him and they were going to kill him. He realized, oh no, I know. It was one night he realized that they were cannibals. They went and they attacked another tribe.

Speaker 9:          01:44:18       They, all of a sudden, one night it had never happened before and all of the years he was there, maybe, maybe it's only 10 years. They all put on paints and they went to the next village and they killed. And then they ate flesh and the guy just went, I'm fucking out of here. Where's my, where's my return ticket? And he left. And so he came back to the village and he wrote about it and he lectured about it and then he went back like, yeah, like 15 years later he goes back, finds the dude. And this is like, I think that I think the movie might have been called keep the river on your right. And he went back and he found the dude and they like rekindled their relationship.

Speaker 5:          01:44:54       Oh my God. It was incredible. Keep the river on your right. I think so. I'm writing that down. I need to see the. What the fuck, dude, I didn't know that the incidences of cannibalism were so prevalent among native Americans. They would occasionally do that. Like the Nez perce apparently they had occasionally catch people and kill them and eat them. Yeah. Especially people like they'd catch you had your brain, right, that eat your whole body. Yeah. But probably your brain

Speaker 9:          01:45:26       do. But think about it. I mean it's very symbolic. You conquer and you consume.

Speaker 5:          01:45:31       Yeah. But it's, it's the thing that freaks us out the most, the idea being just reduced to meet, right? Yeah. And by someone just with a bigger Tomahawk, you know. So I mean, or do to got to you before you get to him. There's no like real serious weapons. Yeah. Bows and arrows and spears and,

Speaker 9:          01:45:54       and it's really a fight to exhaustion. See who lasts the longest

Speaker 5:          01:45:57       mark or the capture you if you're trying to get away from them. But in their case, I mean, do you imagine if you and your people had lived in this one patch of land for 10,000 years, then all of a sudden these fucking demons carrying death in their breath and they're very touch. Like just getting in contact with a makes all of your relatives wilt away, kills 90 percent of the people you know, just them being around. Not Forget about all the shit they killed with guns. All the people they probably shot and killed because just emanating evil and death. Think about that.

Speaker 9:          01:46:32       And then they ran you up like fucking cattle and they rape your women. Jesus. I mean, enough can't be said people. Oh, are already fucking liberal. We're in about the native Americans. It was pretty bad.

Speaker 5:          01:46:45       Well, I didn't know how bad it was until I read a priest's account

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       of Columbus is men interacting with native Americans and it is horrific. Yeah. This a religious guy went with them on one of the voyages and wrote books about how they would hack off guys arms and they would tell them to bring them gold. They had to bring their weight in gold and if they didn't do it, they would hack off one of their arms and they do it in front of everybody else to freak them out. And at first the natives were very friendly and once they realize that the natives were friendly and the natives were sort of weak, they, they started taking advantage of them and brutalizing them and getting them to acquire gold and they would smash babies on rocks like this priest. Oh, it was horrible. Horrible, horrible shit. Is Priest wrote about this. So when we think of Christopher Columbus, we think of this noble Spanish gentleman who came over and landed in America and you know, looked regal as he got off with fucking rosy cheeks and walked amongst the people and declared this American, all that bullshit and made friends with the Indians, but they were a horrible band of monster.

Speaker 9:          01:47:52       They also stopped in the Caribbean on the way here and they literally committed genocide on an entire fucking island of people. They work them to death. Same thing like a lot of these people, gold didn't mean anything to them. Like it was something that they used to decorate or whatever, but there was no value the way there was in Europe. So they gave it to them. They're like, yeah, you want the gold fucking just right over there and grab the gold. And then when they. And once they took all that, then they made them start working for it.

Speaker 3:          01:48:19       And it seems like also like these tribes that they encounter, they don't, these, they don't have any concept of large scale slave labor like the Europeans did. Like the Europeans were like, oh, we'll just get you to work for us or we'll kill you like that. I don't think that was like a thing that native Americans were known for and I would say probably there probably are we. What are we doing here? Why we keep digging for gold? Like what the fuck is going on here? Yeah. Like they had weird concepts in terms of like what is possession? Like they didn't have the same sort of concepts of this being yours. Like if you left something there, he would just, someone would just take it because it would do well that's the thing that I want. It's right there. I mean I'm just going to take that stuff. Anybody's. Nobody owns it. So it confused the shit out of them when they would get accused of stealing. Like there was a whole different in, in many of these inner encounters apparently there was a whole different, like not just a language barrier but a culture barrier. Like understanding what these fucking crazy white assholes we're doing.

Speaker 9:          01:49:15       Yeah. But the whole concept that you still see in, in a lot of like Middle Eastern countries, which is the, the idea of giving to as a host, you know when you come, when you come to somebody's home, you give them your bed and you give them food and date. You would never ask them to leave as long as they want to stay. And it's all about generosity and with the western mentality is more about collecting and owning.

Speaker 3:          01:49:43       Yeah, it's interesting. And isn't that also what we were talking about before that a long time ago is a lot like living in a place that has unbelievably harsh winters. A long time ago you're faced with danger all the time and you had to make bonds. They had to be important. So like if you came over to my house, I'd have to think, hey greg, you know, the ship might go down one day. If the ship goes down, I'm here with you. You're here with me, we're going to break bread, we're going to sleep. You sleep in my bed. I got you bro. You're here. So like there was like this intense need to form these community bonds today. Nobody even knows what they're fucking neighbor is. Do you think they live like that? A thousand years ago, you fucking first shore knew who that guy was. Then you for sure knew who that guy was and everybody would be on the lookout for some people that we didn't know that might be sneaking over the top of the hill. There's none of that anymore. It's gone.

Speaker 9:          01:50:37       So when you talk about gossip, well you know, small towns from a long time ago, people guy. Everybody was gossiping. Yeah. You know what they were saying, that guy's a rapist to watch out for him. Or Hey, this guy can vouch for it. He's a good guy. That's what gossip.

Speaker 3:          01:50:51       Yeah. And you needed to know. You know who's a freak? Who was fucking crazy, right? Who's doing weird shit? Hey, who's jerking off and all the girls' shoes in the middle of the night when the fuck did you find the girls like doing it? Yeah. The girls will like it. You got to set separate them. They knew their own hut with loose door, send them to vegas, just people like what we've become right now as the people that are living here in 2016. It's a weird process that's been going on for hundreds and hundreds of years and we're just at the end of it. We're obviously not at the end end, but we're at the front of the line as far as all the history of it all pushing behind us. It's hard for us to appreciate how weird it must have been to be our parents or to be our parents. Parents already come here from another country or to be someone who existed back when you only live 30 years old and you die of old age. Have a heart attack at 30 or you'd catch a disease or someone would shoot you in the Arrow. That was like a giant panda brothers and sisters died from shit like smallpox or in the balls. Get in a boat and leave Spain and head across the fucking ocean and land in the Bahamas. Those are marauders, those people.

Speaker 9:          01:52:09       Well, I just think about landing even even, you know later to like, you know, the beginning of the 19th century when people were, um, or the 20th century when people coming over from Europe, you landed in, in, you know, Manhattan, you've got a burlap sack with some clothes on it and an address of a fucking second cousin out in Brooklyn. You don't know how to get to Brooklyn. You don't speak the native language. You speak in Italian. Italians are fucking hated when you land your shit. Nobody wants to help you.

Speaker 3:          01:52:40       People don't realize that today because that stigma's kind of gone away. My grandfather used to about all the time

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       because, you know, he came over from Italy and my grandmother came over from Italy on my mom's side and they would talk about it all the time. How horrible was kids would call them Guinea Wasps, you know, that he would be, you would be treated as like a saw, a lower level person, you know, because you're Italian. But then suddenly it went away.

Speaker 9:          01:53:06       Jersey shore brought a passion real housewives. They're getting lops yeah, they, they're the real housewives of New Jersey. Holy Shit. Yeah. It is funny because like the Italians are in some ways, you know, you think about the, the holy Roman Empire. I mean, you and I were both in Rome this summer and it's mind blowing that, you know, irrigation started there. Every major thing started there. Demark. Well, I guess to her he was Greek or Roman, right? Didn't they have that first? Well, who, who, who, who created democracy, I think it was the Greeks. That's a Greek word, but uh, but just what you get blown away by what the Italians are capable of. You see the craftsmanship of marble work in this country that the Italians brought over and the, the, the opera and, and then you see Jersey. Sure. It's such a fucking weird dichotomy of Italians can be so fucking dumb and materialistic and yet they are the, the fucking high point of culture and civilization.

Speaker 5:          01:54:12       Well, in some ways, but there were also fucking kids. Yeah. Right. Like that's a big part of what they did to. Yeah. They did that along with make incredible architecture. Unbelievable. Art, incredible buildings filled with statues that are just beyond compare, an incredible artistic expression, but rampant kid. Fuck it.

Speaker 9:          01:54:39       Right? Yeah. And the. And the.

Speaker 5:          01:54:41       We both grew up Catholic, right? Yeah. I mean we knew Catholics. Our family was, were all Catholic. Everyone around us was Catholic. Yeah. We all knew a priest that tried to fuck a kid or a kid. Well, you heard about a priest. You fucked a kid. Yeah. Or My, my friend was um, he went away to some fucking camp in this. The priest like climbed into bed with them and was trying to grab his hand and shove it down his pants. And he was like literally fighting the guy off and running away from him.

Speaker 9:          01:55:09       It was a crazy story. I was like, what? Yeah, the Catholics. I think there's a work ethic that comes with it and a service of God thing and a Christian soldier thing. And then there's also all the repression and shame about sexuality that plays out. The Irish are the same way the Irish have, you know, they saved the Bible. There's this book called how the Irish saved civilization and when the Roman empire was being destroyed, they were burning every single Bible in Europe, like they literally destroyed all the bibles and in Ireland there were the monks that were like, you know, the, uh, the, uh, what are those scrolls called in Dublin, I'm the, whatever they're called, but they were hand writing bibles by the fucking thousands and that's what saved Christianity. Wow. And so, and then, then you get into the poets, you know, Yates and Eugene O'neill and, and you think about what the Irish have offered to this place, but the same thing. Massive kid fuckers.

Speaker 3:          01:56:08       Yeah. It's the, the, the number of people throughout history that were kid fuckers. That's what was really weird. It was like if you go through history and you know, what would you call it, pet arrestees that would you call it up the technical word for, is it having sex with underage boys? But it's really common like, like throughout human history throughout Rome and the Middle East, and there's so many fucking instances of great men threw in. Like it wasn't socrates a kid fucker. No, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean like how many people quote socrates and then have that caveat, but it also fucked kids. No, that's not. That doesn't give them a pass on that. They didn't know you weren't supposed to fuck kids back then. Cause people. A lot of people probably fuck them too. It was probably sexual exchanges were like we a bunch less rigid idea of what sexual exchanges were acceptable, but that's not that long ago. Know. It's weird that hundreds of years ago people were just fucking fucking animal before I'd fuck a kid. There's a lot of animals. I think that would probably be good to fuck right. I think a horse would probably fight back the least. I don't know about that. I wouldn't fuck her horse because if they kick you, you're dead. That's true. They decided they're done. They're not going to be cool about it. That I can be like, all right, go ahead, finish. No, they're going to take you off of him.

Speaker 9:          01:57:27       He want a fat, lazy animal. Yeah. You don't want death by female horse or a male horse if you're into that kind of shit. Probably had, she seems she's pretty popular show.

Speaker 3:          01:57:39       Yes. Yeah, that would definitely be the one, you know, it's weird that it's illegal to kill animals when you are going to do anything but eat them like um, and it's illegal. It's illegal to fuck animals. Like you can't fuck them, but you can kill them. Yeah, you can eat them, but you can't fuck them. Yeah. So you can't do a dual purpose. You can't kill them. Fuck them. Then eat them because then you're fucking dead animal and that's gross.

Speaker 9:          01:58:07       Illegal. I think it's more illegal to fuck a dead animal than a live animal. That makes sense because what are you doing? Then? You're really just masturbating because there's not a living thing in your presence. It can't be rape if it's debt,

Speaker 3:          01:58:19       but you notice how there's like stages of like how you feel about the dead animal. There's one stage. One is the live animal, right? If you fucking alive, anima, you crazy asshole. What are you subject to that animal to stage two, your fucking a dead animal. Like what is wrong with you? Like why? Why do you want to fuck this thing? Forget about whether you should be able to do it, but if you kill it and then eat it, right, everybody's

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       fine with that because that's like what you're supposed to do, but you can't fuck it's body. But what if you just jerked off with a chicken cutlet? What if you took a chicken, he wrapped around your Dick and someone came in the room like, what the fuck you doing? Greg? Like, dude, I'm telling you it sounds crazy, but it feels so good and I just cleaned it up and then I eat it for dinner. It takes a bite. What's this nice cream sauce? Dare you. Now that you say fucking a chicken cutlet, it's all I can think about it because he had slippery. It's soft. When those gmo chickens would wrap right around your heart and it's a breast. You thinking about it being at your tit. Fucking it.

Speaker 5:          01:59:22       You know what you would do? You would take a bag, like a Ziploc storage bags? Yeah, the chicken cutlet in the bag and then heat up some water to about a 99 degrees and then you dunk the chicken cutlet in the water so that it heats up. It gets, but you know, like a body skin temperature. Then you just covered that bitch with. Yeah, just lather it in there. And then you put an oven Mitt on cutlet. You wrapped that color on your shaft. Oh, crimes against humanity. Never felt so good and then yeah, you can eat it. You're gonna Cook that Shit because you've tenderized it. Especially like you don't have to use in edible oil. You could jerk off with a nice avocado oil or coconut oil. You know, avocado oil has a high flash point. It's good oil to jerk off with because then after you're done, as long as you don't come on your chicken.

Speaker 5:          02:00:20       Oh, you know, you pull out. That's gross. I don't want to come on your food, but that way it will be like really green multiple uses. I love it. Well, we can't accept the fact that we wouldn't. We want pleasure. You know that we want pleasure from a fleshlight is gross. You want to fuck that thing? Oh, that's gross. That we want pleasure from a chicken cutlet. Using an animal flesh as a masturbation tool will eat. It will sink our teeth into it and swallow it belong as you interested in animal will eat a cow's fucking milk. Leave. There's rule so we. Here's the rules. According to section 69 of the sexual offenses act of 2003 69 commits, a person commits an offense of intercourse with an animal. If a he unintentionally or intentionally intentionally, excuse me, performs an act of penetration which is penis be. What is penetrated is the vagina or anus of a living animal. So blow jobs are afraid. So that's not intercourse with an animal and blow jobs are free. But notice how both of them are heat. You know, to he doing it, they're not referring to a chick fucking a horse. That chick fucking a horse seems totally legal. Wouldn't be a horse. Fucking a chick though. Not the chick. Fuck No.

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       That dirty bitch. She shows that horse what's up? She backs up to them, keeps them stuck in that stall. He can't back up or go forward. It's totally against as well.

Speaker 8:          02:01:48       It has to do with, uh, David Cameron and the prime minister. I think of what the UK or Britain, uh, just just talking about if he could have gotten in trouble if something happened with some allegations of something in some memoirs about something that I'm not reading all of the article. I was just reading them

Speaker 5:          02:02:03       his penis in a dead pig head. He did. And that's what it says. That's the allegation.

Speaker 8:          02:02:09       Well, he was in a university. Oh, so, but it was breaking down if what he did is actually illegal or not. And you, it has to be a dead animal or this was a dead animal in this court in this case.

Speaker 5:          02:02:19       So for the live animal it's sex with an animal. Yes. So if it's dead animals, no big deal.

Speaker 8:          02:02:24       And then I broke it down that it would have mattered where it happened and if someone would have taken a picture of it,

Speaker 5:          02:02:32       if there's no picture, you're fine. If it happened in public,

Speaker 8:          02:02:36       you're also maybe, okay,

Speaker 5:          02:02:37       that is fucking hilarious. How weird is it that we have rules on what we allow you to fuck, but you can kill them and eat them, but you can't just kill them. You can only kill them if you're going to eat them. If you can't just shoot a cow in the head, leave it to rot even though that's like the natural processes of animal falls down. Cro, start eating it. Rats eating the grass devours it. It gets, you know it decays and goes into the ground, but you can't do that. Will shoot if you are, unless you strap a bit and it's mouth. Sit on it and whip it around a fucking to Deauville track. You can do that. Then he breaks his leg. Then you can kill. Shoot him in the head, the dentist fair. Here we go. Weird rules with how we interact with animals, not.

Speaker 5:          02:03:17       I'm definitely not saying you should go around fucking animals. I'm not saying you should be able to. I'm not saying you should hope nobody interprets. What we're saying is that. I'm just saying it is weird that we make rules about things like that, like who was fucking these animals to the point where they're like, we gotta write this down. I'm surprised there's not more animal fucking because think about how horny people are and you think about people that can't get laid. Oh yeah. And I just. It seems incredible to me that, that you don't hear all that. Maybe it just does. People don't find out maybe this more animal fucking going on than we really are aware of how many, many people's lives alone with a fucking giant dog. Yeah. Like one of those big fucking sheep dogs. That's weird that a guy would live with that because he's fucking it.

Speaker 5:          02:04:08       Oh Greg. That's so not true. Sometimes they just have a nice pet dog and they love them and they give him a kiss on the face and they throw the ball for him and he's a wonderful companion, but at least a few guys are out there right now while I'm talking. Three hundred million people in this country plus Mexicans. What's that number? Three 50. Whatever it is. We don't even know what the number is. Right, and we don't want to say plus Mexicans. I'm not trying to be racist. You're welcome here. I say he could stay. That's what I was. Fuck. Yeah, let stay. She still fuck

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       the animals, but what I'm saying is at a 300 plus million people, there's at least one person right now who has his balls covered in whip cream. His dog is sucking on his balls and so many more than that. Yeah. At least one though. He has super confident. Like if I had. If they said Mr Rogan, would you like to bet $10,000 on that being true? Yes. Yes. That's good money right now. Out of $300 million has whipped cream on his balls and he's jerking off while his dogs looking. It's not. And then the, the map. So the spots on the map where it's happening and it would be like those trump states just like, you know when you like, I can't believe they're all red. It'd be like that's what it'd be like. Like, like the sky, like a constellation in the entire country would light up. It'd be like 3000 people at the same time. That's too much. Right? Well, that's probably not happening. It says right here that uh, there's beastiality is legal in Kentucky, Montana, New Jersey, Nevada. Of course, Ohio. Texas Jersey does permit civil unions. You can marry an animal. You can have a civil union with your animal. Fifty five percent of the states were in beastiality is legal same sex marriage is not.

Speaker 1:          02:05:53       Oh my God. That's a thing that is insulting the states, which do not criminalize beastiality yet. Banned same sex marriages are Kentucky, Montana, New Jersey, Nevada, Ohio, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming. Holy Shit. They don't criminalize theology, but they have a ban on dudes. Marion dudes. Just a misdemeanor and a lot of other states too. What if you, you're a gay for a male dog, right? How's that work? I think he can't do it. So if you're allowed to marry a dog, you could fuck it for sure. Right now they don't have problems with beastiality in those towns, right? Oh No. Jersey Jersey allows for a civil union amongst people who are gay. They don't allow for a civil union amongst you and your animal. Yeah. How dare you interpreted that way, but you know, I mean, how can, how can you say that it's okay to fuck animals.

Speaker 1:          02:06:54       Gay People can't get married. That is the way. The fact that we let that stay on the books, like everybody needs to sit down and go, what are we doing? Like what's this? What does this. Do you think it's okay? Is it okay to fuck his sheep dog? But these two lesbians that can't get married out here, man, get out of the way. Boys that insult and get out of the way. But now it's national. Now gay marriage is legal in all states, correct? Is it? I think so. I mean it'll be challenged once trump comes in is illegal and all states federally. I think it is. Right? I think that was a a year ago. I think it's federally illegal, but it's the states that have issues with. That's interesting. So it's like the opposite of the problem with marijuana. Marijuana being legal in a lot of states, but federally illegal, a weird system.

Speaker 1:          02:07:37       Never get it. That was the issue with that lady in Kentucky. She wouldn't. She wouldn't personally wouldn't issue the marriage license and so that's right. You're right, Jamie, you're right. Yeah. That was that crazy lady for Jesus. Jesus don't want no clear cut each other off onto the power of government and they brought it to the convention. The Republican convention. She was a hero. A goddamn here. I'll pull it around. I'm gonna. You know what I love is the trump's inauguration. He see what he's got lined up for the talent so far. Mormon Tabernacle choir and some of the rockettes. A bunch of them won't do it, I'm sure. Meanwhile, while the Democrats I heard, I don't know, is this confirmed that the Democrats are putting on a concert that same night and they've got springsteen Lady Gaga, fucking Jay z and beyonce like literally like 15 of the biggest names in entertain and trump is such a star fucker.

Speaker 1:          02:08:32       This is kill it up. How Weird the Democrats are doing something on the inauguration night like that. Why did that? Maybe it's not that night, but it's around then maybe they're trying to fuck with them. Oh yeah, totally. Fucking with them. I think it's raising awareness that we have to stay vigilant that, you know, I don't think we should shut down government, but I think that we should make sure that the constitution is being honored. That's the big question right now. How, how does a guy go from being a reality star to being the president? I mean, it's almost beyond imagination, like the fact that it's real and I keep opening up CNN everyday going, oh yeah, everyday, everyday I'll go to CNN.com. I go, Oh yeah, yeah, he's the guy. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. He Won. Now that bit you did about it last night about how we just wanted a fuck.

Speaker 1:          02:09:28       Oh Damn. Don't give a away. I'm still working on. Supposedly this was called the. We have the people concert, but I'm not seeing. There's no tickets for sale right now. Uh, we, the people for trump. No, this a democratic concept. Supposedly. There's rumors that a promoter was going to book it. Is it called a clock of cooks? A class? This is a clean. According to politico, this was gonna happen, but cucs or anybody who supports Hillary. A cook is cuckold like a guy who. I mean, it's not just that. It's like has been cheated on her cook. If you're a, if you're white knighting, you're a cook. Like it's a new alt right. Speak. No, she came out of the originally from the porn, a phrase cuckold in, which is like a guy fucks your wife in front of you and you'll go like some guys like watching. Oh No, it goes back to Shakespeare. Yeah. But they, they changed it. But how is it that they're maligning her for her husband cheating when trump has had three wives. But wait a minute. Who's, who's the deed? All right. Isn't that a big generalization?

Speaker 9:          02:10:35       Well, they went after they brought, they brought out, uh, all of all of Clinton's ex mistresses at the Republican convention.

Speaker 1:          02:10:44       Well, what's that? All people that he allegedly sexually assaulted this a little stronger than just mistresses. Um, I think it's probably a combination. It's the best stuff. I think the all stars, there were women that were accusing him of rape, weren't they? Were they all? I think so. It was in the or accusing him of sexual assault and weren't. That wasn't. That was the big deal was it wasn't just that he had affairs with these women. Yeah, it was that. There was like some allegations, right? It's all. Yeah. I think that's what it was, but it is amazing how much that was used against her list of sexual advances and things like that. Sexual advances is, in my opinion, very different than sexual assault. Groping, groping, okay. Forcibly kissing. So when you say sexual advances, like it's always like, what does that mean? Does he talk to her? Probably like grabbing pussies. How dare you, how dare you.

Speaker 9:          02:11:38       What is weird is that you know, without permission, and again, I'm not defending trump on this one, but the first move your first move, you can either go, you can go hard or you can be Johnny Gentlemen. You know, and not too many guys are saying, may I kiss you? You usually just go in and try to kiss somebody. Right? Which is what he did. Not only that, can you go in and grab a woman's Vagina as your first move? Can you cut the third? Can you steal first and second and go right to third. Who says you can't? Well, if it worked, it will be a fucking bold move.

Speaker 1:          02:12:13       Didn't he say they let you. Wasn't that one of the sun?

Speaker 9:          02:12:17       Yes. And he's talking about crazy groupies. I don't want to defend it because this is a way to do it. Like if you're sitting, like I remember when I was a teenager there was a girl driving a car and I didn't know her that well, but we were like 16 or 17 and while she was driving I put my hand. There were like three kids in the back and everybody's getting high and I put my hand on her knee and I kind of worked at. I worked at down the thigh slowly, slowly. Is it okay not saying it, but it's, it's dark, it's quiet. And I got, I got to her, I got her vagina and I massaged it while she drove. And then we got to where we're going. I got out of the car and I never saw her again. Was that in fact Joe Rogan immoral?

Speaker 1:          02:13:01       Not In my eyes. Um, girls like boys and boys like girls, she might've called her friends over and going, dude, check this out. This do fingered me all the way. Home was awesome. And I went home and finished. Ooh, maybe she knows she finished. What does he get home to grab them by the pussy quote. What? He said your girl's hot as shit in the purple. Says Bush. Now coast host of NBC today show I got to use some tic tacs just in case I start kissing her. Trump says. And when you're a star, they let you do it.

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       Trump says, grab them by the Pussy. Trump says you can do anything. He's being funny. You know, it's unfortunate that, that, that's, you know, when people like making this, this thing about it being a locker room talk is inexcusable. You can't say it's locker room talk like it can't expect someone's words when it's two guys talking shit to each other like that to be transferred literally onto like a, uh, like when you're reading it, you're reading it out and you're not taking into account. There are two guys sitting next to each other on the bus talking shit being funny and that one of them is a fucking renowned entertainer and his whole thing is about him being this braggadocious winter and uh, he's, he's obviously playing it up and he's playing it up to an audience of one, not to audience of 80 million or however many people found out about it or more or whatever the hell it was that read that.

Speaker 9:          02:14:27       But can you see that as a, as sort of an insight into his character in terms of showing women from a power structure of him having the power in them not. And will that affect how he leads the country? For sure.

Speaker 3:          02:14:40       That is absolutely a way to look at it. Another way to look at it is he was used to groupies that wanted to do and a lot of them probably did. I think when you're a fucking billionaire,

Speaker 9:          02:14:53       when you're powerful, forget the money.

Speaker 3:          02:14:55       Yeah, but he's also a multibillionaire. He has many billions of dollars. The type of gold digging holes, the muzzle launch themselves in his direction. I mean it must be like they must have to fight them off like, like the, the hoard and Lord of the rings. Just fucking attorney. I mean, he's worth a lot of fucking money. A Gal could just sneak in and take a piece of that.

Speaker 9:          02:15:19       You think he's peeled off a million here and there for women.

Speaker 3:          02:15:22       It wouldn't hurt them. Think it wouldn't hurt them. Maybe take, get some nice good at a gift shop. Get yourself settled. He does not. He's not a Marauder of business marauder because just because he likes money. Like he likes the whole thing. He likes all of the above and that's part of all of the above, of the massive success. He can do whatever he wants. He flies in his jet. He's got billions of dollars. Got this super hot wife, he's like, he's, he's the president of the United States. Now he's doing what I mean, that's standard for his operational procedure. He does whatever the fuck he want.

Speaker 9:          02:15:57       Well, it's kind of animalistic because if you think about it, you know the, the re procreating is the most important thing and you get to do that as a male when you are the most powerful. So in the animal kingdom, all that, everything translates into being able to fuck the female. And so for a guy like that, you know, to be the most powerful man in his own mind means this despoiled

Speaker 3:          02:16:21       yeah, the winner goes the spoils. Plus he's heterosexual. It's just that boils it down. Heterosexual man with a massive amount of money and power and you know, and now he's the president with the fuck. We'll see what happens. It's going to be interesting. The interesting thing to me is now there's a guy who has been literally paying off politicians for the longest time, right? Giving massive campaign contributions. Now he's the president himself. What's he going to do when it gets in there? I mean, he's even talked himself about how the electoral college is stupid and he's like, yeah, well we probably should go to the popular vote. He goes, that would be a different race though. I didn't try to win the race, like saying that she won the electoral vote or that she won the popular vote, but he won the electoral college vote and she won the popular vote by many hundreds of thousands.

Speaker 1:          02:17:12       Three was he drew three or 4 million

Speaker 3:          02:17:16       case. Like he was saying, well that's a different race. Like you could do a popular vote. He goes, it actually be an easier race, but it's a different race. Like if you want to win the electoral college, you got to win those states. It's just how it goes. And he figured it out and he did it and she even avoided those states to Bill Clinton's fucking angst. Apparently he was furious that there's some story that he threw a cell phone down and he was yelling at her, you got to go to these places. You've got a campaign. He was. She was like, those aren't my people. Like too many liberals thought they had it in the bag. Too many liberals thought, well, everybody thinks the way I think and everybody I know thinks this. Trump can be president. There's people just all throughout those cornfields just was so happy, so happy when he got an office man. There's a lot of instagram posts that I follow. Instagram pages. You go to people's pages and it's all Hashtag Maga. Hashtag make America great again. He gives me my pickup truck and my make America.

Speaker 1:          02:18:09       I would have talked to every one of those motherfuckers in two years. I want to talk to all of you face to face and how do you account for yourself. Don't say that because then they're going to blame the liberals and you're a part of the liberal conspiracy and the reason why trump wasn't successful because the liberal back Congress tried to interrupt the power structure. Liberals don't back Congress. Trump, listen man, I know how it works. [inaudible] DOT com. I'll fucking tell you right now. The Republicans have the right idea. If he is not successful. He's got the Senate and Congress and the Supreme Court and the Uber Guide, the gubernatorial control. He's got it all. That's Chris's agenda, doesn't go through. He cannot blame liberals. I'm hoping with great sincerity that we slowly phase out. The idea of having one individual president I think is ridiculous and I think it goes back to the ancient fucking primates and their alpha male king. I think families occupy that one thrown too many people. Too many bushes, too many Clinton's. Just stop, stop and would. If Donald Trump wins and then you know, few years down the road, his son gets in, what if they're the next empire? That easily could happen. Yeah, I know. You never know. It's. The idea

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       was great when we first started. The idea was great to have one person who is really exceptional and have that one person lead, but I think at this point in time, the collective strength of human beings has been demonstrated really clearly in this world. The collective strength is far greater when everyone contributes, when it's a collective group of minds thinking and communicating about things and people go, oh well, you know, everybody's going to want their way and we have to realize like what's the right way? Like there's too much debate back and forth about what's the left and what's the right, what's the healthy way, what's the, what's the correct way for like the society to be even and smooth and your kids be able to walk to school in the morning without worrying about someone taking them and eating them. You know, like there was this fucking guy, Jordan Peterson that I had on recently. It was talking about these posters that they put up in Russia in the 19 thirties saying don't eat

Speaker 1:          02:20:21       children

Speaker 3:          02:20:25       who's talking about Marxism and communism and where, where can go awful and where a lot of these ridiculous posturing intellectuals that claimed to be Marxist, they don't understand the consequences of Marxism and he does really, really well. And so, you know, you talked about the Gulag archipelago and reading about all the different things that had happened to people that had become indoctrinated into these ideologies and then started carrying out these horrific crimes in the name of them. And fuck, it's terrifying. Finding all the people who died because of communism. Like, like we look at human history, it's just a bunch of people getting jacked.

Speaker 9:          02:20:59       Well wait, so you're saying that there shouldn't be a strong leader? Are there shit because Marxism is without a strong

Speaker 3:          02:21:04       later then? Well I don't think there should be one person, but I think we should figure out who the top minds as far as people that want to contribute who the top minds are and vet them out and have a whole goddamn panel of people like, you know, like what, what superhero movies would they go to? Like A, like Captain America, a council of elders or something. Right. You know, we always have the hose, we have a bunch of wise men sitting around there would be glowing from behind, like some thor type shit. Right? It's literally what we need.

Speaker 9:          02:21:36       But the elders is the problem because a lot, a lot of times these oligarchies become old people. Like, like Congress before, before Johnson came in, Congress was literally seniority. Every committee in Congress was based on seniority. The oldest motherfucker ran things and so crazy and it was crazy and it gets totally backlogged. Any legislation. And he came in and he, he broke that up. So he's alive the longest. He knows the old ways, right? Right.

Speaker 1:          02:22:06       The old ways we will continue the old words. Yeah. Put your powdered wig on. How long were you away from that? How long ago was the powdered wig? Two hundred years ago. The day. Whether it was like, what the fuck are we doing? I'm not wearing the wig bro. I'm not wearing the fucking wig. Like what day? I should bring it back. Fuck it. My hair fell out. I'm gone. Powdered we'll with you. What? The comedy store you, you and me. Fanny fanny packs right here, dude. Right there on that. That's right. I, I wear mine all the time and my son gave me shit about it. And then guess what? Six months later he's dead. He's still got that fanny pack. What? He's wearing those. I'll get 'em one. Yeah, I've got some. My higher primate ones. Ones. I'll give you one of those. Hey, I wear it all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:22:51       That's what I'm saying. I'll praise be to dice clay. He started. He told me about it. Yeah. Well, I always wore war fanny packs. I'd been wearing fanny packs forever, but they were crappy and then dice clay came in. I went, what is this exceptional piece of hardware you have around your waist? It was like, oh, you'll like this. Oh yes. It's from roots. Roots, roots. His fanny pack. It's fucking beautiful. The way it clips together, it's like it's perfect size or hate shit in my pockets. Transmit phone year. I take everything out of my pockets wherever I go and I lose shit. Shorts don't shut. It was nothing in my pockets. A little man bag. That's it. I wore a fanny pack this morning. I got a sports one because I ran. Ooh. Those are good and I put it around my waist. A little sports once.

Speaker 1:          02:23:36       Oh yeah. Oh by the way, shit my pants while running this morning. Not Hard, just a. It was a shark. I was coming up the hill. I was, I was in mile for, had nothing left and I and I thought I had to fart and just Bam shirt and my underwear. I did that the other day in my house. Yeah, just a little squirt and what she's as Christ feels like such a failure, but it had some good farts before the problem. Yeah. I got motivated because I had from you on it. You were on a roll. Rumblers was Jesus and it was just me. I wish I didn't have to cover them from nobody, so I was pausing and leaning into them and I'm just a little fuck, fuck, catch the shower. That's a shower. But it was really interesting because as soon as I got on the bowl, all of a sudden I had explosive diarrhea.

Speaker 1:          02:24:28       I'm like, where was this? Like? I had no idea that some diarrhea was looming. Meanwhile that's holiday eating probably. Yeah. Well dreams and shit was also. I go off the Diet and I started eating like Pumpkin Pie and ice cream and she did all the cream. Yeah, with a lot of bread. I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich last night, but as the ultimate failure, because your job as a human is to provide for your family and not shit your pants. You think about it all the time. Every time you fart, you, you. There's a little moment where you weigh in on it. You feel it out, feel your intestines, you fill your anus, you make a judgment call and you let it rip. What's interesting, if you think about how tuned in you are to the sensations you get from your inner colon, because there's times you know like, oh no, I'm about to shit my pants. There's like A. There's a certain alarm that goes off like when you're like, oh no, no, we're concerned

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       a little too hard here. Okay, we've got a problem here boys. We got a runner. We got to. It

Speaker 12:         02:25:31       just barely keep it in their closing rates going up and down and it's the same exact

Speaker 5:          02:25:40       feeling that you get is when you're trying to hold common. You know that Domo. Yeah, like superbad and clamping everything in like that. I've, I've always say one day I'm going to try Tantra. I'm going to learn how to like completely like guy said that you can have like an internal orgasm for your contractions so long that you come, but no come, comes out and your body just reabsorbs it and it makes you like Super Sayan power.

Speaker 4:          02:26:04       Yeah. I've choked one back. Wow. I just got to grab the base right before impact. And so what? He's really hard. It's got to be long enough where it begins, but not so long that it comes out and I've pushed it back in again. But what if you cause an injury? Yeah, that's the problem. What have you get crazy and you just really grab it. Why? I've only done it a couple times. Mop broke your own Dick because you grabbed it too hard. God Damn. Life would not be worth living. Can you imagine that? Not Having your Dick come anymore for the rest of your life and knowing that

Speaker 5:          02:26:35       what percentage of your life revolves around getting rid of come once a day. Okay. But once a day. So if it's once a day, if it's even 45 minutes of your time, the other 23 hours and 15 minutes are bullshit. You thinking like, this is what I can't lose. I can't lose

Speaker 4:          02:26:55       embarrassing. Myself. Said to a lot of guys like if you had to choose between being blind or having your Dick break where you can ever get it up again. Oh no question. What would you say? Give me the fucking stick and the dog.

Speaker 12:         02:27:15       Give me this tv one, two glasses. Various to possession

Speaker 4:          02:27:24       and he's getting laid after the show.

Speaker 5:          02:27:27       Man. I was uh, driving last night and I was listening to that song. You know, sometimes you go through your phone and you're a look at an itunes, like recently added like, Oh yeah, I forgot I bought this. I listen to some old school stevie wonder's superstitious song I listened to like three times in a row last night. Coming home from the comedy store, it's like God damn that song was.

Speaker 4:          02:27:48       Yeah, he made some of the great. I mean just anytime somebody can take soul and funk and bring it together. That to me is like, we were talking about it last night. I was talking to Dean del Ray about soul and fucking earth, wind and fire and uh, uh, who did I listened to you? Yeah. So sly and the family stone when you get them when they're pound in that fucking base and get little little fucking fast guitar going. Yeah man.

Speaker 5:          02:28:17       But I don't know. I mean there was an amazing time

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       of music and like the sixties and seventies, like sometimes I wonder if we have so much music that we're constantly cranking out. Like how many people go back and check out some of the old site, how much great shit just got Kinda Ms. misplaced, misplaced last year.

Speaker 8:          02:28:40       Bruno Mars is bringing back that sound a lot. He does some cool shit that's got that sound. He's got some great shit. Childish Gambino album. I think I've mentioned it to you. It's almost like a funk album now. Really. People were expecting a hip hop album from because that's what he does usually, but it's a lot of like funkadelic will basically what you're describing. Yeah, that's really good. We sober, that's the concert. Did the 1200 milligrams of edibles for. But I, I got the CD recently. I bought it for my mom for Christmas. Do you understand what he just said? Twelve hundred milligrams of edibles. He did. How much? How much is a gummy bear? I like 20. Oh fuck. Up At old Brownie. That was a thousand because I knew it was going to be a crazy concert. They did this three d experience, so I was. I was going to go in and fight at any point or it was all was waiting for it to hit it never hit.

Speaker 3:          02:29:29       See. Here's the deal. Jamie has some weird constitution were edible. Weed doesn't work on him. Wow. Yeah. Agent ever hit? I don't. I don't think so. Oh, he was. He's always a little high. That's the problem. It was like his, his constitution is like a dude who's on a low dose of edibles all the time. So I think when you give Jamie a high dose of vegetables, his body goes, I know want to do with this and your body just clears it out of the way. Interesting. It doesn't work on him. He's an alien.

Speaker 8:          02:29:58       I don't know what to do. He'll be fine. Take more than Joey Diaz. He's given me plenty and I've done it. I like I, he gave me 800 during a show when he was on here and I didn't know whatever. Nothing happened. Yeah. He never gets too high. But. But here's the thing. He gets high when he smokes it. Super. You have to smoke a lot to get high. No, not necessarily.

Speaker 3:          02:30:18       Totally normal in that regard. Yeah. Like normal. Like if we were all sitting around passing a joint, he would hit it the same amount as everybody else would be. Just we all be looking at each other like, Ooh, there's been many a podcast we've done including the beginning of this one. More as, as it starts out, you're like, whoa. I don't even know if I should be talking right now. I'm barely holding out of the words as they're coming out of my mouth and forming them in the right way. It's like their little fucking clay kids that are running out of my mouth and I got to like form. All right. Put your hat on. So barbecued. Why are you upside down this new weed? It seems to be getting stronger. This a la speed. We'd like to speak. I want to know what's going on. Like since legalization hit, it feels like the weed went up a bump, like pumped

Speaker 8:          02:31:03       or maybe ask for less, less than strong lead. Like I wanted back in like whatever I was getting back in Ohio, like middle, mid, we'd call mids. I just wanted to go back to the middle. He just gave me something that was like $5 cheaper. I was like, no, that's not what I wanted. I wanted what your shit. He basically

Speaker 5:          02:31:20       mild. I don't even have it. No, you, you just got to take a little baby hits. But the problem is everybody likes taking a couple of hits. I that's part of the fun. She'll take a couple hits, but like last night at the comedy store I went way too far. Way Too. How many hits is that? I only. I never get. I try not to get too high before the show, like I never get as high as I got before this show. Before I stand up show I'd like to be right where I am now, where I was high a couple of hours ago and then go on stage if that's the way, the best way to do it. But afterwards everybody was just passing joints around. It's just since it's legal now, everybody just goes out and they're all just passing joints. Hey man, he wants some of this. Oh, well fuck it. And Ron White with his contraptions. He's got the fucking pen. He's got a joint. He's got his own Tequila and a cigar.

Speaker 5:          02:32:06       It's hilarious. Who drove him home? I don't know. Somebody did. I don't know what happened last night, but uh, he was talking about how he left. Hey, I'll just left my truck back here, came back and got it. It's an animal. We need more people. I can see the last of the Mohicans constitution. My Dad had that constitution, you know, they got John Wayne apparently would be the last guy drinking. Then I'd be an a drank whiskey and he'd be the first guy on set and he was on point for everything. If you were late. He was like, what the fuck? I got a buddy of mine who's a firearms enthusiast in Vegas. My buddy named Justin Justin. Justin's a legit giant. He's like seven feet tall, 300 pounds a gun nut and he can put the booze away like nobody's business. First of all, he's a legitimate hundred pounds bigger than me and so I can't compete with them just liver wise, just like volume wise.

Speaker 5:          02:33:00       He's just way bigger. His body just burns through it. Come on, dude. We're drinking. He just, he's just, he's way too big and experienced. He just puts it away. What does he drink? Um, makers and coke always makers and coke. Always makers and cover. You know what together you don't have to ask. There is right there. And if he gets a meal, the CFDA. Wow. Legit giant. He's the sweetest guy in the world to super, super good dude. So he's. He's in for two entrees at a meal. Oh Dude. We feast in Vegas. You go to that place was the place he told me that the Brazilian place he took me. Oh, Fogo de Chao. Did you guys go there and we'd been to Texas? Yeah, we go to, um, there's a bunch of good steak houses, like a craft steak strip steak. One of them's the MGM and one of them is at Mandalay.

Speaker 5:          02:33:46       I always forget which one's which crafts steak is mgm. Right? That one's dish is one at the palm, I think. Called nine. So good. Yeah. Yeah. That place is amazing. That plays amazing. Pick UFC this weekend, dude, after 11 tomorrow. How are you? See? Yeah. You'll see this weekend. New Year's Eve?

So we'll do the weigh ins, go get something to eat and go to the gym, go wax and pads around. It's fun. Just relax. You take the weekend off because I can come in to read the weigh ins on the one day which this way usually it's Friday, but it be Thursday now. Then the fights are on Friday night. And then d, do you do much prep? You have to like review stats and stuff? Most of the prep I do, I just do naturally, believe it or not because I'm just curious about the fights because I know they're coming up. So like we did a breakdown show on, um, Monday. Yeah, on Monday we did a breakdown show. We went over the card and I'll do more of that on my own, but it's not like anybody asked me to do it and it's not like I'm, I'm doing it because I want to do it.

Speaker 5:          02:35:23       I do. I'm doing it because it enhances my appreciation of the fights. Find out a little bit about each dude, watch a few of his old fights go, Ooh, I like how he does this or look how she does that. Or Oh, this guy's got a good one, good position. Like if you get, he gets you in this position. He finished his guys. So it's fun to do it from that perspective. So then when I'm watching the fight, um, I've, I've got a kind of an understanding of how, at least how they used to move, you know, six months ago or a year ago. People get better quick too is the other weird thing about this world. The MMA world is changing so fast. The like the level of athlete is moving in such a fast direction. These guys keep getting better and better and better and better and better and they're all getting better, so it's hard to tell, but when you can pair like a top level athlete of today versus a top level athlete have, you know, 20 years ago, that's when you see these stark gigantic differences.

Speaker 5:          02:36:13       You know, when the UFC started in [inaudible] 93 in comparison to 2016, it's just stark crazy differences, which you're not going to see guys stay at the top as long you think, well, some guys or some girls can, you know, depending on how good they are, some people just have massive advantages that are very difficult to overcome. Like Anderson Silva, when he was in his prime, Anderson Silva had a massive advantage in timing and speed and creativity and striking. Whereas he could defend himself on the ground. He was difficult to take down and when he got him down, he's pretty good defensively with his guard, but standing up he's a goddamn genius. He was a virtuoso and he would just like move on you and do weird shit to you. And then blam catch you with a front kick to the face or something. He would time you figure you out, find your distance and then land some crazy shit on you and fuck you up.

Speaker 5:          02:36:59       And it did it to so many people. So when a guy like that I was at the top, he's so truly exceptional at one particular aspect of the, of the game. A lot of times they can go on a good run, you know? So it's, it's hard. It's hard for people to go on a run like demetrius mighty mouse Johnson's probably on like the longest run as a champion now. I think on the longest run the most wins as a champion. I think he's, he might be like right up there with Anderson in the most wins. And then maybe John Jones is in there too. Wait, is he? He's the smallest guy. He's won 25. He's a flyweight champion. But he's a, in my opinion, he's the best pound for pound guy because if you look at like, he's definitely smaller than the other guys. He couldn't move differently because he's not so way down by gravity.

Speaker 5:          02:37:42       So it's, it's very difficult to like look at his movements and say, well you could compare him to a guy like for Overdo, it was 240 pounds, like for Breesa was just more hampered down by gravity. Like his body just has to push around so much more. There's no way he can move with the kind of fluidity that I got like mighty mouse, Ken. And what's the biggest guy? That mighty mouse will fight? Anderson Silva 10 fight win streak. And Demetrius Johnson is at eight right below George St Pierre, which is at nine at night now. I think this is as of July. Oh okay. So Demetrius defended his title again recently. So he's tied with George St Pierre for second place. So that's like a guy like Anderson. Perfect example, super tough. John Jones, another one. Perfect example. Jon Jones is a ridiculously talented athlete and so like when you have these like really, really talented guys like extreme outliers, they, they tend to be able to go on roles also because when you fight them, it's terrifying because you know, you're stepping in there with the Alpha who's stepping in there with Anderson Silva and his prime and he bows to you and you're like, oh my God, what the fuck have I gotten myself into?

Speaker 5:          02:38:41       You know? Yeah, you can pump yourself up for it and get yourself thinking like, I'm the fucking man now. But like when you actually across the street from the man and you're looking at each other eye to eye and you realize like that's Anderson motherfucking Silva and I'm about to step into the ring, step into the octagon rather with the best ever. He do enhanced sit on the edge of a tall building, so it's hard for them to get over that. It takes a super strong mind just to be able to fight at your best. Whether or not your best is good enough. That's another aspect of the fight. Whether or not your best is good enough is really secondary because you're not going to be able to be at your best. You're going to be so freaked out and so fucking nervous. Your timing's going to be off.

Speaker 5:          02:39:23       Your adrenaline is going to be fucking pumping through your veins. You might get an adrenaline dump, so you might tie her out in the second round. You got to manage your resources. You got to manage your anxiety and your facing a goddamned engine, like a real live superhero character and he's seeing all of those weaknesses in you. He sees everything. He sees everything too. When you start moving around, when you would move around with them, he had moved around with you and he would see how you move, whether they move slow, like he would take his time. He would take his time and then just open up on guys. It's fascinating to watch him, man, because he would dissect guys. You'd see him dissect and guys he'd be bouncing around and move and he would change his footwork. He would like throw a little fake your way and see how you react to you.

Speaker 5:          02:40:05       I could have hit you right there. Okay, I see what's going on here, and then you do some stuff at him and he's like, no, not today with that. And you would see him doing all these calculations in his mind and setting up traps and then somewhere in the second round he would attack and when he was in his prime, it was just stunning to behold. Here he is right now, hood a standing in front of this guy, hands down, and he just barely moves his head out of the way. It's just timing. I'm just trying to figure out then Plop pop some with a jab and drops him. I mean, you're watching all this in slow motion to unfortunately, but this was when he fought. You should Okami. I mean he was just an assassin back then. He was so good. That's when he was the middleweight champion and he was just a lighting people up in there.

Speaker 5:          02:40:48       Man, if you're a guy guy, get up because he's better on his feet. I didn't give a fuck dude. Go to Anderson Silva highlight reel. See if you could find that. He didn't give a fuck if you were on your feet like you were going to get knocked out against him in his prime. That's his attitude. He would stand with anybody. I mean, his standup was so exceptional, but he's still fighting. Yeah, he's still fighting, but he's 40, 40 or 41 now and that's the only fucking thing in the world that's undefeated. His father time, man. Just check this out. This is him when he was in his prime, just slides out of the way and drops out dude with a punch. I mean he just had a way of moving. Let's just see if you have a like a highlight reel. Not just this one fight. Oh, it's highlight tribute. Oh, okay. I see. But it's just the same fight a couple times in a row. This guy had a real good chance to get some travis luder. There's a bunch of people that he fought. They're showing. He was so goddamn good. That's Travis Luder caught in a triangle getting elbowed in the head.

Speaker 5:          02:41:50       He was, at that time in particular, he was the next level of striking because we had never seen anybody who had like real world class striking skills in the middleweight division like Anderson did. He just had, especially in particularly in mma, striking, just grounded his balance is amazing. While he was just exceptional, truly exceptional and physically strong for sure. But the big thing about Anderson wasn't like how big he was. It was just how, how technical it was and how, uh, how brilliant his uh, ability to, uh, figure guys out was. This was the guy he fought named Lee Marie Lee Marie is the guy who put on the biggest bank robbery in the history of the great of Great Britain. That guy stole hundreds of millions of dollars, allegedly from a bank and is in jail I think in Morocco now because of it. But, uh, he was an assassin to and they to meetup and Anderson Silva lit them on fire.

Speaker 5:          02:42:49       Just fucked him up. Just stood right in front of them. Lead, kick the shit out of him, beat his ass, took his best shots. He was so good. So you friends with Silva? I know him, I see him. He doesn't speak English that good, but I always give him a hug when I see him. He's a very nice guy. Yeah. And again, it's the greatest of all time if you're a fan of the sport in my opinion, like that guy when he was in his, like whatever. There's like a few year period where someone exist at the highest

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       of our pms and when he was in the highest of our pms, the argument is really between him and maybe fate or a million Eiko who fought in pride. Um, I think fate or is a real possibility. Like I could, I definitely could see the argument that he was number one instead of Anderson. But it's really like, who the fuck knows they play on different organizations, different people, you know, I think the, the talent level probably a little bit better in the UFC, but it's arguable that it wasn't because he was fighting cro cop in his prime and Nogueira in his prime and he it fade or fought some of the all time greats at their best and beat them. So it's arguable that he fought a tougher range of opponent. So maybe it's arguable that fate or his accomplishments or more impressive because of the opposition he fought was bigger, more dangerous. And I fought cro, cop cro, cop was just a, an assassin, just smashing people, knocking everybody dead and he walked him down and out kickbox them mostly. That's mostly what the fight was about.

Speaker 4:          02:44:09       So when you get to know these guys, like I'm sure you're more friendly with some than others do. Is that hard to affect your, the way you call the fights in terms of, uh, being critical?

Speaker 3:          02:44:21       It can be. I try not to make it though. I try really hard to be as objective as possible, but what I'm saying and sometimes people get upset like that I'm friends with because I'm talking about things that they're doing wrong or things that are going wrong for them and so they'll think that I'm rooting against them and I'm like, look, I'm not. And they'll say something to you back. Yeah, we'll have conversations with them. I'm like, dude, I am not rooting against like, this is what I'm seeing. I'm seeing this like I'm seeing, you know, I know you're thinking that you're winning this part of the fight or you're thinking that I'm being hypercritical, but I have to say it. If I'm seeing it and I'm not, I try really hard to have a point like I don't want. I'm not a critical person.

Speaker 3:          02:44:59       I'm like mocking someone for no reason or did a talking in a negative way about their technique for no reason. It's only because it's not, it's not happening and I want everybody to know the momentum of the fight and also I want to know what's going on that's wrong. Like so because your, your job as a commentator is not just to to say what's happening and talk about what's happening, but in mma it's also to explain things like I have to explain certain things like that are critical in a fight. Like save someone gets kicked in the leg really hard a few times. You see them start to limp on it. I have to point out that I see him limping now. This is going to be huge issue. If he tries to shoot in or if he wants to move away, it's going to hinder his mobility.

Speaker 3:          02:45:41       It's a very important. So then the people at home now they go, okay, well that makes sense. Oh Yeah, look, that guy is limping. Oh Shit. He got hit in that same spot again. Now he's on the ground again. Oh my God. He can't get up. I see it now. So you know, you know you're a storyteller. You're also, you're, you're talking about a mathematical problem essentially a problem. It's being duped out. Like there's literally like force problem. It's like this versus this and you're trying to get there. You're trying to hit harder in the better positions, so like the geometry of the human body, you're trying to accelerate towards the vulnerable areas and do it better. So what are the best ways to do that? And then there's a science and art behind doing it in the best way. And it's my job to explain that science and art to the best.

Speaker 3:          02:46:27       I can live in motion while it's all happening. I can't be biased. I try very hard to not be, you know, because it's really important that I point out both sides and sometimes people who accuse you of it and I swear to God if, uh, if you do feel that I'm doing it, it is absolutely not intentional. I try very hard to try to be as balanced and unbiased as I can walk splaining exactly what I see playing out. Even with my friends. Like I'll see my friend getting fucked up and I'm like, he's, he can't drop that right hand. He's driving that right hand. The guy stepping to the right and he's going to catch them. And then boom, when they catch them, like fuck, like you see it happening sometimes before they can see it. Does that ever affect how close you let yourself get to a fighter?

Speaker 3:          02:47:09       No, no, no. I respect them all very deeply. You know? And I, and I, I, I'm really good friends with a lot of them and I want the best for all of them. And that sounds contradictory. It sounds like impossible. Like someone will think like if they fight that person and they hate that person and you like that person, but you like them, like you're, you're a trader or something or like what? How can you talk to that person? How can you talk to him? He's my mortal enemy, but look, man, I hate the fact that you guys are enemies. I don't know how much of is real, how much of it you do it for press, but I'm not happy with it. But I liked the guy. He's a good guy. The guy. I can be friends with, somebody that you're not friends with.

Speaker 3:          02:47:45       Like if you have some guy that you don't let, you would have to have a good reason, you know, like somebody fucked you over. I couldn't be like a competitive reason. Like two guys who fought and they're bitter about it, you know what I mean? Like if it was like if you told me about some guy fucked you over and a business deal or something like that, I'd be like, oh well fuck that guy. You know what? That guy did something wrong. It's just a competitor. Like that fucking guy I tried to follow in Miami and I bombed. Fuck him. Like, you know, like I kicked your ass. Yeah. You know. And that's with a lot of fighters, they develop these very, these deeply sort of conflicting relationships with fellow fighters. Like you can't get too close to them because then you're going to have to fight them or.

Speaker 3:          02:48:23       Yeah. Some guys don't give a fuck. Some guys become friends with guys than wind up fighting him. Oh yeah. And is there any shay stories of that happening? A lot of guys, a lot of guys have done a lot of guys. They started out friends and then because they had a fight each other like Jon Jones and Rashad Evans, that was a big story like Rashad Evans was like Jon Jones, bigger older brother and they were real close and then when John fought for the title, he fought for the title because Rashad was injured and John won the title. John stepped in on short notice, one the title, and then it became a possibility of one day Rashad fighting John for the title and then they wound up getting super bitter about it and not liking each other anymore. It's really, really interesting to watch, but that's just one example. There's a lot of guys who are close, close guys. They're buddies

Speaker 5:          02:49:07       with each other and they get in there and they beat the fuck out of each other. Yeah,

Speaker 9:          02:49:10       it's crazy and not get close. It's like with Comedians, you know, you talked about hanging out at the store. It's like, I can't talk like somebody was telling me about, like he hates being called a legend who said that. I'm not gonna say Whoa, zero legend. Yeah. Oh Dawn Gavin. Now, I mean, and the point was, well I don't want to know, just telling me it was Ron White, oh ha. And I and he is, he's alleging is legit, but I think he got, he got an intro of being a legend the other night you were saying to me, I fucking hate that because you know, I'm in here scrap and like everybody else, you know, these lineups are killed. Like the lineup the other night was like, it was like Dalea and you and him and a nick and succeed and it's like on any given night you don't want to be called the legend because that's just immediately puts you on a shelf instead of in the fight.

Speaker 9:          02:50:01       And so anyway, he said that to me and the reason I want to say it is I could see somebody taking that into context and going like, oh, you hate being called alleged. But it's like I can. I've been called that by young comics and it's like, don't call me a fucking legend because I, first of all, I didn't earn it. And second of all, like I'm still playing the game. I'm still on the roster here, but I was just thinking like you can't have that conversation with somebody who's not doing what we do because it would almost sound like a, like you're full of yourself and it's same thing with fighters. It's probably things that they can only talk to each other about that they could never talk to straight people about it because they just haven't been there. Oh for sure. So how do you not get close to other fighters that you might have to have to fight one day?

Speaker 5:          02:50:46       Especially when there's a lot of guys in the same way, in the same camp, which is very beneficial because if you get a bunch of like really good guy like team Alpha male is a perfect example of that. There's all these guys that are around the 135, 255 pound weight class, but it's like really elite Guy in 1:25 even. But a lot of elite guys in the lower weight classes and they all train together but they never fight each other. Yeah. And then they had a big falling out because Tj dillashaw won the title and then he left team Alpha male and went to Denver and now they don't like each other like this. There's so much camaraderie and, and, and teams and, and like there's this weird sort of tribal bond that goes with teams and the teams that compete against other teams and they're like gangs and a lot of way, a lot of ways, but you know, they're not, they're not criminals, they're just a bunch of dudes that are bonded together.

Speaker 5:          02:51:34       And women too fucking serious hardcore women in the sport. Now there's like Amanda Nunez, the world champion, she's the first openly gay MMA fighter. He's a champion rather first openly gay MMA champion. And she's the women's 135 pound fighter. She's the one who's going gonna Fight Ronda Rousey. Where is she from? She's from Brazil. That she lives in Florida. Strains at American top team. Just like the big camp. It's like there's a few big camps all throughout the world, but when it comes to like elite level MMA fighters, like who's got the biggest amount of them, it's between Jackson's in Albuquerque, New Mexico and um, Miami American top team. They just have so many fucking elite fighters. Tough for her to train with people if she's that good to find somebody who's appear. Now she, she fucking fights with dudes. Dudes. I'm sure that a lot of them do.

Speaker 5:          02:52:26       Almost all women spar with dudes at least somewhat. And that's the most of the dudes, at least in high level camps are very respectful. Like they're not, they're not gonna. Try to hurt a woman. The best people in the best camps now realize the, uh, the damage that you take. Inspiring. It's like a frequent conversation now it's like to not spar hard. Like sparring should almost be like technical and playing and like very light. So you're not damaging your body, not taking unnecessary shots. Taking people to the leg. Well, you kick them a little bit in the legs. It's not bad, but the problem is the head. That's the real problem. You know, and even kicking him in the leg, there's no, no reason to kick someone full blast. You know, you kicked the bag full blast. You don't need to kick a person full blast.

Speaker 5:          02:53:10       And so these big teams, the more talent you get in like one weight class, the more you get a bunch of sharks circling the same seal or whatever the fuck you, whatever the analogy would want. Like you get better, more competition, you better interaction as long as there's a good comradery between all the fighters, but it's so hard to maintain. Almost always wind up getting mad at each other. So many fucking hit somebody after practice and some of the, you know, there's always some thing where they're going to have to fight. Some days they talk shit to each other and know well also, I mean I'm sure you know a lot more about this than I do, but the people that will be drawn to a sport like this might be contentious people. They might be people that have pretty good size egos and are maybe confrontational and so those people aren't going to necessarily always interact that well with others.

Speaker 5:          02:53:59       Quite a few of them for sure, but you'd be amazed. It's one of the more fascinating things about mma. You'd be amazed at how many college educated, very reasonable rational people just view it as the ultimate extreme challenge. Whether it be, you know, riding a fucking snowboard off the top of a mountain and you get dropped off in a helicopter and you go down the side of a cliff. It's those kinds of people. Yeah, like those kinds of extreme athlete. People that might've gotten into BMX riding or might've gotten into a lot of things that we don't think of as being like a violent aggressive, but they're ultra risk taking sports and the reward that comes from doing like a flip when when you're, you know, bmx jumping and you flipped through the air and land on your feet. Like that's I'm cheating death thing. And those same people. I think a lot of like elite ones are getting. They're getting interested in possibly competing in MMA and taking that risk and challenging themselves in that way. So you see a lot of very smart people, man. It's, and I think that at the highest level you have to be smart like you. We've talked to a guy like John Jones. He might make some poor decisions with his life because parties aligned. It's kind of

Speaker 3:          02:55:04       crazy, but he's very smart. When you talked to them and you look in his eyes, you know whether or not he has access to the same vocabulary as Christopher hitchens did. No, maybe not. But he's a fucking genius. And fighting. He knows how to figure people out. He knows how to fight under pressure is good as anybody alive. And when you talk to him, he's very engaging. He's not in any way stupid. He's a very smart guy. He has his interest in his focus and if he is his focus and his interests were an intellectual pursuits, if he, if that was really what stimulated him and made him want to, uh, you know, to follow through on something like that, I'm sure he'd be really good in that. Yeah. I would think it's real easy for people to sort of discredit someone and someone's intellectual capacity just because I wasn't talking about intellect.

Speaker 3:          02:55:48       I was just talking about in terms of Alpha status, that it is hard to put a bunch of Alpha people near each other without a little bit of a, you know, banging elbows. Yes. But my point is that less than you would think it would be much more comradery and much more social, like very reasonable interaction gentlemen interaction than you would imagine. There's much more of that. Yeah. But the problem is a guy like conor mcgregor comes along and he talks mad shit and he likes the world on fire and everybody wants to talk shit now and I get it. I get it. I mean, it sells, it sells paper view. It's good for the sport. They more money if they talk shit food. They just released this thing on a. someone did it on how much? Conor mcgregor. He sold more paper views in a year than the entire roster combined.

Speaker 3:          02:56:36       Wow. You compare all the other fights of like. I forget how it was dealt with. Brendan Schaub sent it to me. He sent it to you, Jamie, but I saw. I'll try to find out what kind of money are we talking about. I got it right here. I don't know what he gets paid. I don't under. I don't know how much he gets per paper view, but look at us. The entire roster drew three point three to three point two. Oh, three to three point $2 million in 2014. Conor mcgregor drew double that on his own in 12 months. Well, GSP holds the record for the most pay per view buys in total because he had a lot of paper reviews more than connor. Connor holds basically every other paper view. Record. Mcgregor has drawn an insane six point eight, 5 million buys and just 15 months.

Speaker 3:          02:57:22       Holy Shit. Wow. Twice as many buys in one year than the entire UFC roster in 2014. Just his fights. So whereas a run see making. Well that's a good question. Like um, he was saying recently that uh, he wouldn't fight unless it's a, well actually nate Diaz was saying that he wouldn't fight rather, um, who was his opponent in the last, not this last fight, which was a Eddie Alvarez, but the fight before that, there was a rematch with nate. Nate beat him in the first five and then it was a real close fight in the second fight. And Connor wanted decision and nate saying that he won't fight unless he gets 20 million bucks and a lot of people say, well that's too much. He's not going to get paid that I don't. I don't know how much. Like, how much money is there? Like let's look at it this way to be 20 million in purse or in endorsements or it's going to be perse, but here's.

Speaker 3:          02:58:17       And paper you is separate than purse, right? Well, no, no, no paper views based on pers. Pers is based on paper, like you get points or you get a piece of the action or you can get a guarantee, right? So if it's going to be guaranteed, like say if that's what he said. And obviously I'm not a mathematician, we know this, right? So if he said 20 million bucks, that's what he wants to fight for them. If paper view is what, $60, how much does it cost? Let's say it's 60 and they, let's say they sell a million paper reviews, which is an excellent number. That's $60. Million dollars, right? Yep. Okay, so $60,000,000. He wants a third of that right off the top and then you would got to think, well who's going to fight? Conor? Conor is going to take a third of that to write it.

Speaker 3:          02:58:55       At least he's going to, he's not going to take less than me. What's up nate? And he's gonna fight conor. So if he's gonna fight connor, Connor's going to take probably even more than that. Right? So it's 20 and what? Twenty five. So there's less for the UFC then those two guys. Well that's how it is in boxing, that's how it is in like if you look at the person's for like a lot of boxing matches the way they have it described as like the big guys like floyd mayweather get the lion's share of the purse and then everybody else gets less including the promoter. So ticket sales, which is probably just a couple of million ticket sales are probably pretty substantial or anywhere it is to get five. It was 17 point 7 million. So there you go. Seventeen point 7 million in Madison Square Garden. Right. And then what about that giant Vegas place that the t mobile arena in Vegas, that's a lot more people.

Speaker 3:          02:59:42       When that sells out, what is it? You're saying $70 million for one ticket sales. That's the square garden. Holy Shit. Yeah. So then you've got merchandise, but that's theirs, right? Because it's about the UFC. It's not about the fighter like I don't think. I mean maybe if the fighter is selling, they're selling conor mcgregor merchandise. That's a different story. Yeah. Then they should definitely get a giant chunk of that. I don't know how much they get. And then this isn't including sponsorships. Well, there's no sponsors, right? The UFC has some sponsors in the octagon. I mean they have some movie sponsors and stuff, but as for the fighters, there's really no sponsors that they carry into the octagon with them. The only sponsors, Reebok and some people have a deal with monster energy drink. Again, putting hats on after they went. Not always in the UFC, most likely in beltour or unless they have a monster energy drink deal.

Speaker 3:          03:00:28       So UFC also has a deal with but it's, it's, it's real. It's real weird. For the longest time they did, they had it all over their shorts. They would wear whatever they want. They would wear tee shirts coming into the octagon based on. But then they signed this deal with Reebok and a lot of people are upset about it. They have to wear reebok stuff now. Okay. It's a hot point. I'm sure. A lot of money. Yeah, it is for a lot of fighters, for a lot of fighters it's like it was hundreds of thousands of dollars. So um, so in terms of like how much money is left then, how much does it cost to run a global organization like that? How much does it cost to keep the infrastructure alive? How much does it cost to upload everything to review, how much does it cost to hire all these people?

Speaker 3:          03:01:07       How much does it cost to put that production together? Right. So if it's only 60 million bucks and then 15 million bucks from obviously, I don't know. And there's got to be international shit too because they sell it internationally all over the world. I mean the UFC is everywhere. So a big fight, Nate Diaz and conor mcgregor doesn't just sell in the United States. It sells everywhere. I don't know if that's all included. I don't know how they work that shit out. But my point is when someone says he wants $20,000,000, that might make sense or that may may not make sense. Like I don't know what the numbers are. And also you gotta pay taxes, like if you're making all that money, if you're bringing it all that money, you got to pay taxes on that money. Who pays the taxes? Does UFC pay the taxes first and then pay the fighters out of what's left?

Speaker 3:          03:01:48       Do they all act as private contractors? That's a good question. But I don't know. But as far as like how much money they're making, I think for a guy like conor mcgregor, the correct answer would be a fuckload yeah. He's making fuckloads of what's at five fights a year. He's not fighting that often, but he's. He's probably fought in the last 24 months. How many? How many? How many times have you fallen the last 24 months he went on a crazy run beat. Although he be dentists, seaver all though. And then the nate diaz fight. Eddie Alvarez

Speaker 9:          03:02:26       Twenty 15. So one, two, three times in Twenty 15, three times in 2016. So that's about right. That's a lot of $5. Million a year.

Speaker 3:          03:02:33       Every four months. Like that is very hard on your body. Very hard on your body. Hard to do. But some guys like cowboy, cowboy cerrone, he lives off that. That's what he love.

Speaker 9:          03:02:42       Think about it. If you break down the numbers though, and granted nfl or NBA has a lot more revenue coming in, but you're also paying and you know, nfl, you got what 44 guys on the team is interested in these traders, all that fucking shit. You should look like

Speaker 3:          03:02:58       the number was put up, the number of revenue, the amount of revenue that they bring in versus the UFC. It's hilarious. But the NFL is like $375 billion. The UFC is like to. Yeah, I mean the difference is fucking preposterous. Yeah. Like find out there's a chart, like a graph that they can show you that somebody put together that shows you the NBA, the nfl, Major League baseball and MMA is like below hockey

Speaker 9:          03:03:26       and you know that porn use to beat all of them put together NBA, nfl, all of it. And CBS, NBC and ABC as well. And all the major movies all together, dwarfed by porn. And now it's gone. Now it's all gone. I mean the Avn awards at its height, I hosted it when it was 7,000 people in the audience on showtime. Now it's like 200 losers in a room with an open mic or hosting it. Yeah, it's over. Whoa. I shouldn't say

Speaker 4:          03:03:58       that. I don't want to disparage them. Let's just say it's smaller than it used to be. I just think they're doing awesome. Craft work now. Now it's. They're doing it for the love of the art, I think. Sounds different. I mean I. for me it's all about Japanese hidden camera. Massage porn. That's your shit. Yeah, because it's real. I got to see shit. That's real casting couch guarantee that a lot of that is real. That's what I liked.

Speaker 9:          03:04:21       Nerves. Want to see the girl a little bit nervous. Confused. I want to see the transition in her eyes from I'm auditioning for a Pajama commercial to. I'm taking it

Speaker 4:          03:04:32       hit hard on camera. Yeah. I don't want to see two people that are, you know, too into it. I want to see. I want to see somebody get taken for a ride. Somebody just get hoodwinked. Yeah. Like the massage thing,

Speaker 9:          03:04:47       they're getting a regular massage from a woman and it's a good massage. You can tell that these are like practice misuses, and then all of a sudden they just get their there, their on their stomach and they, they get up in that ass crack a little bit and they get down in the valley and you can see and they've got a camera on the woman's face and above and below and usually somewhere else and they keep it on the face. You can see the eyes open and kind of look around and I'm telling you, fucking Mia Farrow, who's a great actress. A Jane Fonda couldn't portray the Sufi dunaway. Faye dunaway could not portray the subtle nuances of coming around to being suddenly fingered by. I'm assuming.

Speaker 4:          03:05:30       Oh, so you think it's real. I defy anybody. I will. I will send you clips that are undeniable. I think you should take that and run with it. Just don't look at anything that points to the contrary. Right? Why would I? Why would you? What his line of perception. It's not reality. It's not empowering to think that that's staged and you're just being tricked by some unenthusiastic people didn't need the money. No. You want to think that this is a real massage. Absolutely. Realize finger in her completely. Heck no, I don't watch those. You don't want something because that seems rapey rapey. But what if the guy's laying down the grill just starts sucking his dick. Now that's from a girl and guy gets a massage from a girl. She just starts blowing them. Well, she, you know, a woman is pleasuring. Another woman. Okay, I see what you're saying. You like it? Yeah, because it's. Yeah, I enjoy it. You want to see everyone had a good day. Everybody had a good day. You know the [inaudible] is getting paid handsomely. She knows she's on camera. Plus they're lesbians. I think most women are. They don't get a chance to explore it as much. Wow. Strong words for some hidden cameras and they're receiving what really happened. I can't believe he's saying that. I believe that all women have the propensity for lesbians, lesbianism because it's soft. They're being touched in a gentle way.

Speaker 4:          03:06:48       Not The way I do it. I do my lesbian and stuff. Lesbian biker style. Yeah. That's style. A lot of hardware.

Speaker 1:          03:06:56       What kind of. What style of fucking do you employ? Something like a lesbian biker. My shirt. I'm like, how a lesbian would fuck you if she was mad with a strap on. Yeah, she's mad. Angry boots on. You were flirting with a guy. The pizza thought so just fucking. Oh, you were talking to the enemy? Yeah. She's got like a strap on with like little, like a dog collar with those little buttons. Little silver snaps pops in place. Yeah. Yeah. Big Green Dick. That's what I think. Yeah. She probably heats it up in the water. Just like that chicken cutlet trick I told you earlier. I can't wait to get home. Hi. Do we have for dinner tonight? Greg Fitzsimmons and space and pool.
