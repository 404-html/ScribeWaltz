Um, I became a big fan of audio books many years ago. It's one of the best ways to spend time where you're forced to sit down and, you know, usually it's wasted time whether you're on a plane or whether you're driving somewhere stuck in traffic or on a train or something like that. Audio books make an amazing companion and actually make a boring trip. Enjoyable. I'm Christopher Ryan, our friend who is on the podcast again today, I believe your book is available. Um, sex at dawn is available in audio form.

Speaker 2:          00:02:36       It was voted one of the best audio books of 2010 when it came out. And I actually read the preface, which is a story of being attacked by a monkey who, uh, who read the book for you, who reads the other two actors. There's a female and a male actor who read, uh, because we, we asked that there be two, a male and a female voice, uh, since it was coauthored with my, someone's

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       all into a quality and shit.

Speaker 2:          00:03:02       Yeah. Yeah. It was kind of weird though. I mean, the, the. Why didn't you read it? While I offer to. They wouldn't let him in. They were like, no, thanks. Anyway, sons of bitches. But no thanks. Um, yeah, when you're a first time author you don't get a lot of respect, I got to say. And you know, the second time around, it's a whole different thing if the first book sell. Yeah, I would imagine. Yeah. But first time around you, they treat you. In fact, I had a dispute with one of the editors and um, which ended with her crying and hanging up on me

Speaker 3:          00:03:33       and in earlier crying, there's no crying in publishing

Speaker 2:          00:03:38       and then she quit. Yeah, like within A. Yeah. I really made her quit. Well, I don't know that it was me or I was the last straw, whatever, but yeah, it didn't end well. But an earlier conversation with her, she was saying something and I said yes, what they were talking about the cover art and they had different ideas and I was like, well, you know, the one you sent me, it's cool, but why don't you send me your other ideas and then we can brainstorm together. And she was like, um, uh, no, no, we authors can only see one idea. And I were business partners here. Why can't I, I'm, what does that mean? Well, why can't I be involved in this? And she said, well, we can't have the inmates running the asylum.

Speaker 3:          00:04:19       Oh Jesus, you're a prisoner now. A mental Haas. And I said, you know, I'm a psychologist. My wife actually does run a mental hospital or a 32 year old idiot. So this is that. What made her quit? You call her a 32 year old idiot. I don't know if I use those words, but that was my implication. Might have called her a cunt. I might have, might have it comes out sometimes there's moments when it's necessary. I'm a audible. Uh, other than that, audible has nothing to do with the Christopher Ryan incident. No, they were wonderful except for not letting me read the whole book. Sons of bitches. What's wrong with you people? But the monkey attacks the most important part. Yeah. And you read that. I did read that they should do a revised version. Let you do it because I generally prefer except Stephen King, Stephen King is God damn terrible at reading his books.

Speaker 3:          00:05:12       He's so boring. You know, when you have an author read the Stephen King books that become exciting. There's so much drama and but Stephen King is so flat. He's amazing author and one of my favorite fiction authors, authors ever. But uh, if you get his audio books, do not get one that's read by him, but that's my warning to you. And then we'd go to audible.com forward slash Joe. Get yourself a free audio book and 30 free days of service. That's an excellent company. I've been using them for almost a decade now. I've been using them for a long time so I can stand up for audible. They're outstanding. And again, they support this podcast and you already know about [inaudible] dot com. We don't have to say that today. Let's just get to Stanley Kripner. He's driven, driven all the way here from San Francisco with Dr Christopher Ryan, and they even did a podcast along

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       the way. They don't give a fuck folks. They double dip and making things happen. Cue The music from flip these. Get these people going.

Speaker 4:          00:06:12       Joe Rogan podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       That was the weirdest one that caught me off guard. And what happened? I don't know. I was waiting for her on it, I guess. Yeah. Well we just, we just rushed through that. Stanley Kripner. Thank you very much, Sir for coming down here. Pleasure. And Mr Ryan. Thank you very much for bringing Stanley. When we first did a podcast with Chris, one of the things he talked about was you and he said that you're a dear friend and that if, if it's possible got to get you on the podcast. So here I am so proud. I'm so honored. I can't believe you actually bothered to make the trip all the way down from San Francisco and do a podcast along the way. How can they, how can people get that podcast that you guys did along the way?

Speaker 2:          00:06:59       Well, I guess, I guess we'll put it up this week and I, you know, we've got a bunch in the pipeline but we'll just bump everybody else and yet people can hear us driving down from Bakersfield on route five complaining about the cow shit smell

Speaker 1:          00:07:13       big part of that trip. Yeah. That is a weird drive, right? It's a weird drive. I took that drive before the elections and uh, that's when you realize a California, although California is mainly liberal, there's these pockets where we have cities where everybody, you know, is fairly literate and educated and then if you spread out towards where they grow things for some reason those folks like to believe and nonsense. And uh, they had Mitt Romney bumper stickers and Mitt Romney posters and like, where am I? Am I in Idaho or something like that. What's going on here? What do you know who met Romney is? I want to pull over and go, what's going on? What is this?

Speaker 2:          00:07:54       But you know, that line about Pennsylvania. I grew up in Pennsylvania and they say there's Philadelphia on one side, Pittsburgh on the other side in Alabama. And

Speaker 1:          00:08:03       so true, my parents, my parents used to live in Wilkes Barre. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's, that's no joke. That's where people wear camouflage to the grocery store. It's total rush limbaugh country. Well, there's so many deer out there and you never know when you're going to have to duck behind a car and shoot.

Speaker 2:          00:08:16       Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, tangentially speaking, that's the name of my podcast. Anyone wants to check out my extended conversation with Stanley? If they had. I'm sure they won't get enough. Never enough. Stanley. That's Stanley. What was your, your name that the Shaman gave you, your, your spirit name? Well, rolling thunder gave me the name. Everybody's favorite. That's everybody's favorite because everybody, he talked to me, but a native American who was not a shotgun, um, who I dedicated this book to add Richardson gave me the of Costa Wash Day.

Speaker 5:          00:08:58       And the best way to translate that is to use a yiddish term mench. Oh. So I thought that was a great either coming from the first native American who got a clinical psychology phd in the country.

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       Wow. And that's this gentleman rolling thunder. No,

Speaker 5:          00:09:16       the other guy who we dedicated the book to, and regrettably as soon as the book came out, he passed over to the advanced age, so the book is dedicated to him and his memory and our long friendship over the years.

Speaker 1:          00:09:31       Now you are. I'm one of the few people that is alive today. They can say they did ask him with Timothy leary.

Speaker 5:          00:09:39       Oh good heavens. I'm. I'm sure there are more

Speaker 1:          00:09:42       people because tim leary to the acid with a lot of people. I'm sure there's more, but the numbers are fairly small. I would say it's less than one 10th of one percent of the population, but you know how it is. Small numbers can have magnificent effects in chaos theory. You have about the butterfly wings causing the typhoon and Malaysia. Yeah, that's what they say, but that's. People don't understand. That's a metaphor. That's a metaphor.

Speaker 5:          00:10:14       It's like a lot of stuff in shamanism is metaphor. You deal with it at the metaphorical level than that. Make sense?

Speaker 1:          00:10:21       The whole term shamanism is very tricky, isn't it? It's. You say it amongst the respectable company and they go, oh, okay. You know, Shamans and what happens with these shamans do you do go to spirit worlds and you're like, well, yes actually, and then like, okay, and then immediately the conversation becomes they're talking to a silly person, right? Which is what I talked to

Speaker 5:          00:10:46       just I don't even use the word spirit world for one thing to be a mom and you have to be appointed the Shaman via community and if the community doesn't consider you worthy of being a spiritual leader, then you don't pass the test and instead of saying we go to a spirit world, I say, well, Sharma's get knowledge and information in ways that other members of their community camp and I just leave it up to that. They say, well, what ways? Well, they get information from their dreams. They get information by observing plants, observing people. They have a very, very keen sense of observation and insight and then that starts to make sense to them. Oh, you mean like a Sarah Apis? Well, Shamans were the first therapists because they mediated problems between couples. They did a lot to keep the community together. They help people to get better. If they were sick or if they were feeling poorly and so they were also the first physicians of the first doctors and they used herbs for reason or another seem to work, so taking it down to a very practical level, you can talk about shamanism and give them the due respect, the life that they deserve,

Speaker 1:          00:12:03       but as a psychologist there's and that's what you are, not that many people in that realm of professional business who accept those terms. They use the term Shaman and it's. That's where it gets tricky, right? It gets tricky in that it's almost like you need a professional word to you know, to to replace it with that people are going to accept in, in, in the mainstream.

Speaker 5:          00:12:29       Actually the word Shaman Commerce from the field of anthropology and the word Shaman originated in Siberia. Nobody knows just win because there were three different tribes in Siberia that used words, some of the Shaman, but they'll. Anthropologists began to notice that spiritual practitioners and other indigenous societies did pretty much the same things. They helped people. They healed people. They use their imagination. They did rituals, they told myths and narratives, and so these other people who had their own words for shaman all got lumped together by anthropologists using the term Shaman, so we're sort of stuck with it and all that I can say is don't take it that seriously because each tribe that you visit has its own word rolling thunder. For example, the subject of our book, the Voice of Rolling Thunder never called himself a shaman. He called himself an inter tribal medicine man because he was able to learn the medicine systems of five or six different native American tribes. He had a whole trailer full of herbs, hundreds of herbs that I saw them firsthand and he would take the herbs that would be most suitable for whoever he was helping out as he put it, whoever he was doctoring, and then of course he did a little ritual that went along with it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       Now how much of the herbs that he gave people were actually effective and how much of it was a placebo.

Speaker 5:          00:14:04       You know, this is one of the important ways in which shamans contributed to the evolution of the human species. Obviously some of the herbs were additional, obviously some of them were not, but they work anyway because of the placebo effect, but imagine a sick person coming to a shaman, the shaman and giving them herbs, doing a ritual waving or a feather rattling or rattle banging a drum and the person for one reason or other gets well. Now what about the people that don't get well? Those are people that don't have the imagination, they don't have the response to the placebo effect, and so they die. What happens when they die? Their drop out of

Speaker 6:          00:14:52       the gene pool? Who is left? The people who are left, the people who are able to access their inner healing ability and passed down those genes to their descendants and that's why today we have hypnosis. We have biofeedback, we have visual imagery and all of the other products of mind, body medicine that work.

Speaker 3:          00:15:14       The placebo effect highlights a really fascinating aspect of the human animal. This, this ability to heal itself by being tricked or tricking itself into believing that it's taking medicine and then forcing some sort of an effect. It's very. It's a very strange and slippery term or slippery ability and it seems so strange that the ability to be tricked would be of evolutionary advantage. The ability to trick yourself into thinking you're taking medicine and healing yourself. We can't really do that consciously.

Speaker 6:          00:15:47       We couldn't do it consciously, but let's go back to evolution. Rolling Thunder often use the term. Sometimes you have to trick a person that they are getting well. You have to trick a person into using their own self healing capacity, their own inner shaman as he put it out. Now you can use that deliberately. We have people who are able to hypnotize themselves, who are able to get visual images of their bodies, mending the bones together and getting well of the cancer cells shrinking. This doesn't work for everybody, but visual imagery as a part of a holistic program were mainstream medicine is also used, can give that extra little edge that can help a person to get well out. That little extra edge is a linear descendant of what Charmin's did some 50,000 years ago.

Speaker 3:          00:16:43       It's, uh, it's interesting the, the placebo effect in that it, it, it's a scientific term, but yet it's not a very scientific action. The action is really sort of mystical in the ability to heal with the mind and using the imagination. It's a very, very strange thing and it's very strange and connected with Sherman hasn't begun shamanism itself. The idea that these plants contain information and that especially like Iowasca, it's my favorite shamanistic brew just because of the fact that they had to figure out over these hundreds of thousands of different plants in the Amazon which one contained dmt and which one contained an Mao inhibitor and combined the two of them, if you don't know what that means, folks, the DMT, which is the most potent psychedelic drug known to man it, it exists in a bunch of different forms in nature, but it's not orally active.

Speaker 3:          00:17:42       The reason why, um, you know, you could eat grass and you don't get, you don't have a dmt trip is because your body produces something called Monell, amy and oxidase and monoamine oxidase, you can inhibit that and you can inhibit it with natural plants. Well, somehow or another in the course of who went, who knows how many thousands of years the Amazon Shaman have had figured out how to take the vine of one plant in the leaves of another plant and combine them together and it was dmt and a natural Mao inhibitor and that's what. That's what created Iowasca, which is an orally active version of DMT, the only orally active version that we're we're aware of and they did it. They say by talking to the plants and the plants told them,

Speaker 6:          00:18:27       yes, this is discussed in another recent book of mine, be mystifying shamanism where we take all these mysteries of shamanism. This is a book by Adam Rock and myself, and we demystify them and cook them into a psychological terms. Now what you say about Iowasca is absolutely correct, and I've been to the Amazon. I've taken Iowasca in Brazil, and that's very powerful. That's very valuable. That's a very good teaching tool to the people down there and even the people from Western cultures. And the question comes up, as you said, of all of the thousands of plants in the rain forest, how did Shamans know how to put these two plants together? And I've asked them about that. They say, well, the plant's taught us. That's good enough for them. I think that it was a little more complicated than that. I think that they watched animals take plants and as the animals began to turn on and show unusual behavior, the shamans began to do that themselves. Now this doesn't really account for the combination of the plants, but maybe they were able to use trial and effect besides being the first doctors. The first psychotherapist Shamans were the first scientists they used to trial and the fact they tried out substances on themselves. If they worked on themselves, they turn to other people. But the genesis of Iowasca is sort of lost in the mists of prehistory. And it's a fascinating topic. And everything that you say about the Moa inhibitor isn't the DMT is absolutely correct.

Speaker 3:          00:20:14       It really is a fascinating topic and it's such a fragile piece of history because the shamans are the ones who understand and know how to make the brew and they pass this information down from generation to generation and if they're gone, if they're lost and we're losing rain forest by, you know, by the acre, like literally as we're talking acres are being dissolved and slowly but surely these people are getting pushed out of their natural home and we're losing the lungs of the earth. Literally the rain forests are the lungs, the earth. I mean that's

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       where most of our oxygen comes from and it's such a fragile thing that we, we, we know so little about its origins and its right there and it's just these few people that are, that are living there that, that truly understand that their traditions and they've had them passed down generation to generation.

Speaker 5:          00:21:08       You used the very same terms at me. Hell Gorbachev used when I talked with him. I wanted him to give me some advice that I could pass onto an ecology conference. I was going into Brazil to speak at and he said, tell the Brazilians that the lungs of the earth are the Siberian tiger and the Amazon rain forest and that the Amazon rain forest just destroyed one of the lungs will be destroyed. Wow. Now there are Brazilian laws protecting the rain forest, but you know, the Brazilian army, the Brazilian police can't protect all of the rain forest and a lot of the ranchers and lumber companies are just coming in and slicing up that rain forest. Right and left. I was in southern Brazil with the Guarani tribe and the Guarani Sharman invited me to a very sacred ceremony and that ceremony, he passed around some brew that I drank from some stuff that I smoked and other people also and after around of shall we say six gourds or pipes of psychoactive substances.

Speaker 5:          00:22:27       I was waiting for visions, but they never arrived and said I could think very, very clearly and then he wanted me to give a prayer and it my best Portuguese, which I couldn't have done ordinarily. I said, yes. Tell your young people to stop hanging themselves from the trees because it was an epidemic of suicide to protest the destruction of the rain forest. Wow. I said, you met. Get the young people to be active and fight the people who are destroying the rainforest. Go into politics, become lawyers. Fight this to save the rain forest. And he said, how did you know our young people were hanging themselves from the trees? I says, well, I'm a member of the rainforest action network and San Francisco and we keep track of what's happening to the rain forest. It's very important for us. It's important for the world in Shamans like you are way ahead of the game because you know what will happen if the rain forests are destroyed.

Speaker 1:          00:23:24       It's a very. It's a very fascinating idea that there's an intelligence to plants and that these rain forests are networks of intelligence. Just that we can't quite tap into it and that somehow or another during these altered states you can and then that's where the information comes to the Shaman.

Speaker 5:          00:23:43       Well, native from both

Speaker 6:          00:23:46       north and South America use the term in one language or another. All our relations and all of our relations are not wholly human beings, but the creatures who walk on four legs, the creatures who crawl on their bellies, the creatures who swim in the seas, the creatures who put their roots into the ground or who stand tall in the forest, all of these are relations. This is the web of life. This is the ecosystem, and you start to destroy that ecosystem and human beings are not far along the way in terms of being destroyed themselves. Is it a weird

Speaker 1:          00:24:23       thing that we can't recognize that while we're doing it, the human race for some reason is doing that and can understand what it's doing to itself.

Speaker 6:          00:24:30       Doesn't that come back? So at the end of it, doesn't that come back to what you were saying earlier about the placebo effect and the no cbo effect, which you know, a tricking ourselves, right? We're tricking ourselves not to notice that we're tricking ourselves every damn day. We're telling ourselves will never die and so on and so forth. So and so loves me when you know damn well she doesn't or whatever it is, we trick ourselves to make life tolerable. Right? Right. So within that context, tricking yourself to heal yourself seems like it makes perfect sense. It really does. It just, it's, it's weird that we're able to do. It's like when you're driving car and your car is a broken pipe and you see black smoke come out like that. I got to get to work and not really thinking about it. We, we, we somehow or another, don't feel the impact of the horrible things that we do in psychology.

Speaker 6:          00:25:19       We call this denial and people deny what's right there in front of them because they have other agendas and other preoccupations. This is one reason I was so interested in rolling thunder and why we wrote the Book Rolling Thunder, the Voice of rolling thunder because he saw all of this 30 years ago. He saw the global warming. He saw the destruction of the rain forest. She saw the pollution of the earth and who listened to him. His audiences listen to them, that politicians listen to them. No, our politicians listing to him now go to some of the debates in Congress and they say that global warming is junk science. Here's massive denial from people who could make a difference and you take the polls of what the main concerns are of the American people. Concern for the environment is now number five or six down the list.

Speaker 1:          00:26:15       Yeah, that's a weird thing, isn't it? Concern for the actual environment is not at the top of the list of poisoning of our own earth is not at the top of the list and could be avoided. We're human beings are so in ingenuity, ingenious, and we have such amazing abilities to figure out new methods to extract energy from things. The fact that we're still relying on fossil fuels and we're still burning things and pumping smoke into the air. Although it does make the best sounding engines, it's tough to argue with that at those goddamn hybrids. Boy, anything sucking the soul away from America. Sarah, it's a prius. Toyota Prius is especially ones with bumper stickers. Something about them makes them extra annoying. Isn't the plural pre I should be. They should be illegal, you know, you mentioned to all our relations a cocoa in the, uh, in the, the hardback have sex at dawn. The first, what's it called at the beginning, the preface and know that is an epic. Ram is like, to my mother and father, the dedication, right? We dedicated, it said to all our relations. I was thinking of this North American, South American Indian thing, but a lot of people thought it was referring to like, you know, group sex or something. All our lovers or something. Right, right, right. Changed it in the, in the favor back. Oh, that's too bad. She'd leave that in there. That's actually cool. It's a cool thing to say. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:27:43       You see, this takes us back to the very first question you asked. You think of sharp and Lucy. Me think of mystical stuff of talking to spirits. Know Shamans are very down to earth. They are concerned with the here and the now. There are concerned with the future. They talk about five, six, seven generations in the future. What is gonna Happen to the Earth in the future? There are very, very practical people.

Speaker 1:          00:28:06       Now you've done research on dream telepathy and you've, uh, you've actually been cited in scientific journals and you've been on tv talking about this stuff, including the tonight show with Johnny Carson was at back in the seventies, back in the day, the heyday of Johnny Carson. Did you have a cocktail? They have cocktails. Did they smoke cigarettes? They smoke cigarettes, right on Johnny Carson show. Did they smoke cigarettes on the set? Not when I was there, no. Oh, Johnny didn't smoke. I thought Johnny was constantly puffing away. Yeah. Know what happened. I was just doing attorney carson sound. Oh, that's Ed. That's Ed Mcmahon. Johnny Carson show 'em. What is dream telepathy?

Speaker 6:          00:29:00       Well, this actually goes back to shamanism because shamans felt that they could communicate with other Shabas who were kilometers away, miles away, through mental focusing and through imagination, through imagery. Now, this tradition has come to us through time and science, by and large, didn't take it seriously, but a small group of scientists called Paris psychologists devise methods to put this to a scientific test. Now to look into dream telepathy, what we did was to take a soundproof room, could a dreamer and the soundproof room electrodes

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       to the dreamers head. Look at the electroencephalograph machine in those little icicle back and forth, rapid eye movements. We'd wake up the person and asked them what they were dreaming. Now at the very same time, there was one of our staff members and the distant building and slash, or a distant room who is looking at a picture, usually a famous art print, some of them by several door valley. By the way out. The staff member was trying to project that image to the dreamer. The dreamer is trying to reach out and see that picture and none of them would transcribe the dreams and then we'd have a team of dream experts try to match the dreams with the picture. After nine or 10 or 11 or 12 sessions had taken place. And then you can use statistics to find out if the matches happen more often by chance.

Speaker 5:          00:30:37       Then they would ordinarily. And much to our surprise, most of the times they did. And we did about a dozen different series. And about nine of these series, we're above chance levels, so we can't say that we have demonstrated dream telepathy because sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. All we can say is that we've made a case for dream telepathy, but I think the most important thing we did was to take green telepathy off the list of symptoms of mental illness back when we first started out, if people said that they dreamed about the future, dreamed about what a friend was doing that got a check mark, that's a sign of schizophrenia. That's a sign of delusional thinking no more. You take a look at the psychiatric indices. That's pretty far down the list. So I think we made a signal contribution in terms of letting the psychotherapeutic world, especially the psychiatric world, know that one can make a case that sometimes dream telepathy does indeed occur and that the Shamans, once again, we were ahead of their time because they did this as part of their regular practice thousands of years ago.

Speaker 3:          00:31:52       The original, when when people are with the Western world originally started studying Iowasca, one of the things that they wanted to do was call harming before they had isolated that it was harming. They wanted to call it telepathy and that was the. That's the name. They came to it because it gave these group sort of telepathic. It gave some sort of an effect that people were able to communicate in groups.

Speaker 5:          00:32:19       Well, my old friend Alan Ginsburg, as you know, was the coauthor of the Ya hey, papers y'all hate is another word for a whole Osca. He and William burroughs wrote these wonderful letters back and forth and they experienced telepathy and alums. Ginsburg went around trying to persuade her a psychologist,

Speaker 6:          00:32:40       you know, use the South American urban your experiments. I took him seriously, but I didn't have a way together. Nobody else took him seriously and that experiments still remains to be done. Now the Iowasca is available now that it is being used in some experiments or another one could see if it lives up to its nickname. Telepathic.

Speaker 3:          00:33:02       Yeah, it's a. it's fascinating that it was already the scientific nomenclature was already home harming for it because it stuck with telepathy and that was like the actual scientific word that we use today. That would be a. that's a real tricky sort of a slippery slope of a scientific name for something that impart some sort of mystical properties.

Speaker 6:          00:33:26       Well that's true, and of course to be properly scientific one often weeds. These terms out that are a little too esoteric or a little bit off the off the cliff and so we use words like harmony and harmony into describe dmt to describe these active ingredients. It's interesting to think about all the different names for what we now call hallucinogenic drugs. You know, they were psychotic mimetics there for awhile and then psychedelics and what were some of the other three or four? Actually always liked the word fantastic. Hans never caught on, but the yellow, they induced fantasy and theologians and the agenda. Well No, I'm theo. John doesn't work because him, Theo, Janice, finding the God within and a lot of psychedelics do help people find the God with them, but some people take psychedelics for other purposes, to have fun, to enhance sex, to explore a nature,

Speaker 3:          00:34:28       don't lose things, bring the God within out as well.

Speaker 6:          00:34:32       In my opinion, they do. I wouldn't argue with that.

Speaker 3:          00:34:35       Yeah, sure. The, the idea of dream telepathy in in mainstream science, it's got to be something that's very heavily resisted.

Speaker 6:          00:34:47       Well, it is resisted, but I think that as the years go by, we're getting a much more intelligence discussion. One of my books is called debating psychic experiences and we have some of the top pair of psychologists debating some of the top skeptics in a very civilized intellectual way back and forth. We give the same number of pages to both the advocates and the counter advocates and this is a level of discourse that never would have happened, but he years ago, the ultra skeptics never would have sat down to help write a book with the proponents of dream telepathy and other such things. So at least the discourse is now a little more civil and the possibility is now being taken little more seriously. I don't know what the final outcome is going to be because I'm an agnostic on a lot of these issues, but you know, I think that this is a human experience that needs to be explored. So let's explore it with as many tools at our disposal as possible.

Speaker 3:          00:35:56       So do you believe that dream telepathy is something that occurs occasionally but cannot be. It can't be reliably reproduced.

Speaker 6:          00:36:06       I wish it could be reliably reproduced because it could be put to practical use then. But no. My belief is it is very unpredictable. Many things in life are unpredictable. I sort of compare it to when people my age have an erection during sex that's unpredictable. I wish I could predict it well. A lot of important things in life, like erections for older people like dream telepathy, like seeing into the future happen, but they're unpredictable. That doesn't mean we shouldn't explore them and study them.

Speaker 3:          00:36:42       What do you believe are the components of dream telepathy? Have you isolated it down to a certain firing in the synopsis? Do you mean do you have any idea of what causes it?

Speaker 6:          00:36:54       We have the equipment to do much more with the brain now than we could. You have to remember the Paris psychologists don't have very much money and don't have the tools to a, uh, to utilize a lot of this equipment. But what we did on our studies was very, very simple. The nights that the dream telepathy seemed to be successful were the nights that the geo magnetic fields of the earth were very calm, very few sunspots, very few electrical storms, and so one could hypothesize that there is a field of some sort of global field were these barely detectable influences and very subtle means of communication that can sneak through. Also, by and large, if there is an emotional connection between the people who are in contact with each other over a distance, it's more likely to happen than if they're complete strangers.

Speaker 3:          00:37:52       Didn't you have some sort of a crazy psychic vision of Kennedy being assassinated?

Speaker 6:          00:38:01       Well, actually idea the alphas drain. My very first psilocybin experience that I had the courtesy of Timothy leary

Speaker 7:          00:38:10       who

Speaker 6:          00:38:11       I went to Harvard to visit and who invited me to an experiment with psilocybin. It was a beautiful and glorious experience. It was done during the days when psilocybin was legal and factors, one of his last legal psilocybin sessions and there was only one Downer during that experience and that was when I had the actual

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       vision during psilocybin with my eyes closed of President Lincoln being shot and I saw the gun at the base of his profile and somebody screamed out, the president has been shot and then Lincoln space morphed into that of Kennedy and there was the rifle except now it was not a pistol, a rifle and somebody who's screaming. The president has been shot. I recorded all of that. I had such an incredible experience. I made dozens of copies and sent it to my close friends and of course in several months the tragedy of Kennedy's death actually happened and so my vision, whether it was coincidental or pre-cognitive, was on record and I considered myself a highly psychic person.

Speaker 1:          00:39:25       You don't consider yourself know exactly. Did that freak you out at all?

Speaker 5:          00:39:30       No, nothing freaks me out in this field. It's just a surprise that sometimes leaves me as a sense of longer because there's more things going on in the world that we, uh, don't take seriously or that take us by surprise. But, um, the thing that really freaks me out is when people do not take global warming seriously, the thing that freaks me out as well, mainstream religions in the world don't give women proper rights to control their own bodies. The thing that freaks me out is when politicians fight each other, leaving the children of the world, especially in the Middle East with nightmares and posttraumatic stress disorder. Those are practical things that I've written about. And those are the things that freaked me out.

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       Yeah, I think that freaks out anybody with a conscience or anyone. He's paying attention to the, the evils of this world. We live. We live in very strange times where we have so much information, more access to information than any generation ever, but yet things more or less are still going along the same course as far as global events as far as, uh, the monopolization of natural resources as far as you know, using the bore to monopolize those natural resources. It seems to be the same as it's ever been.

Speaker 5:          00:40:45       It's a little better. Back when I first became interested in posttraumatic stress disorder, I've written three books on that topic that your listeners can find on Amazon calm. There were 30 wars going on in the world, most of them civil wars. Now there's 20 wars. That's an improvement. Yeah, I guess there are still are a couple of billion people who are displaced in the refugee camps. There still are children who have nightmares every night because they're living in war zones or still are women being raped and brutalized, but things are a little better than they were 30 years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:41:23       Well, things are a little better than there were thousands of years ago, that's for sure. I've had this conversation recently where a friend were talking about how thousands of years ago, if some people up from

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       another land, like they were there to rape and pillage. Now when people show up, they're a part of the global economy. They're tourists and you know, we allow them in even if they don't speak the language and we sell books, tell, tell them where the restaurants are, try to speak English to them to get their money. You know, the world has changed drastically in that respect, but yet, you know, there's still a lot of really fucked up things about the way human beings behave.

Speaker 6:          00:41:59       Well, that was my friend Buckminster Fuller's concept of the global village and Buckminster Fuller had a plan, a logistical plan to feed everybody in the world. If the wars would stop. Now that vision is still applicable, but it's not going to happen as long as these 20 wars are going on and food is unable to go from areas of plenty to areas of poverty. So the conflicts and the wars, not only in the middle of the east but in Africa and even in our own country in terms of the, in terms of the terrorists, the home bread, terrorists who are victimizing people in the United States as long as others going on, we still aren't going to have the global village that Buckminster Fuller digital.

Speaker 3:          00:42:50       Yeah. The Utopian concept is a really interesting one. The idea of the global village, I've always felt like one way to make it happen would be to take these people that are profiting off of rebuilding these countries after we blow them up in like and make it profitable to rebuild ghettos, make it profitable to go to companies and educate kids, make it profitable to, to fix their water systems and provide them with sewage and you know, and make sure that they can take care of themselves, bring food and medicine. And it seems like there's money involved in that. It seems like it's just a matter of transferring the energy to instead of only doing it to come to countries where we blow them up, let's do it. The countries that need it, like make it profitable for countries like or companies like Halliburton to make money by building up third world countries.

Speaker 6:          00:43:41       Halliburton made over $2,000,000,000 from the Iraq war and a lot of that was lost during graft and corruption. Now while this Halliburton Dong to improve the infrastructure in the United States, our country is literally falling apart, especially in terms of transportation, especially in terms of cleaning up the pollution in our country. Dwight Eisenhower was actually the last precedent that paid attention to the infrastructure with this interstate highway system. A Bama is trying to do something for the infrastructure right now, but he's not having much success in getting that through congress. You are absolutely right. If some subsidy could be given to big companies to build up the infrastructure in the low income parts

Speaker 5:          00:44:31       of our country to clean up the polluted streams and waters and oceans and rivers, that would be money well spent.

Speaker 3:          00:44:41       It just thinking about what we're doing with corn. You know the amount of money in the amount of emphasis they put on on on farmers, growing corn and the subsidies that are involved in that. It's pretty staggering and that's the reason why there's so much corn syrup and corn and corn that corn is fucking terrible

Speaker 5:          00:44:58       for you and that's why people are getting obese because if they're taking all of the sweetening from the corn syrup and look at all the subsidies that are going to correlate, there are many natural sweeteners that do not add weight. Some of them come from China, some of them actually can come to the United States. Why don't we have more money going into those natural sweeteners rather than the sweeteners like aspartame for example, that Donald Rumsfeld made money off and which is worse for you than the sugar in soft drinks

Speaker 3:          00:45:39       supposedly. Yeah. I've never heard anybody really get fucked up from aspartame, but I've read terrible things about potential side effects. Yes. But it's so delicious. And a diet coke, that's where it's problematic. Um, I like Stevia. Stevia is good stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:45:53       Steve was good stuff. Yes. So go along with that.

Speaker 3:          00:45:56       Great. Although I have read recently some negative things on Stevia, but someone said that's propaganda and I haven't looked into it.

Speaker 5:          00:46:02       Well, of course, because the competitors are going to spread nasty things about something that's healthy.

Speaker 3:          00:46:08       Yeah. Yeah. The, the idea that someone can come along and have some natural sweetener that doesn't put any calories into, uh, into your food and it's actually healthy. It's very dangerous for the, for the established elite.

Speaker 5:          00:46:21       I'm going to go back to rolling thunder because in our book, the Voice of Rolling Thunder, there's a long interview with him about how he did not pay attention to taking sugar into his body and how he got diabetes and he goes on a long harangue trying to urge people to stay away from sugary drinks, sugary treats, or they'll end up getting diabetes like he did and his diabetes was so bad that Mickey Hart of the grateful dead and I had to fly to his home in the data and get him into an airplane. Bring him back to Mickey Hart's Doctor in the San Francisco area who had to amputate his leg to save his life from diabetes.

Speaker 3:          00:47:06       And this is all from just eating sugar or is that there's some sort of, uh, does he have a natural inclination?

Speaker 5:          00:47:11       Oh yeah. She'll know diabetes as something that it's ordinary for people to gather. They reach a certain age, but there was a genetic proclivity along with that. But he learned his lesson and toward the end of his life he tried to warn people about eating more healthy food, less sugar.

Speaker 6:          00:47:30       By the way, Stan, while you're talking about a rolling thunders genetics, you might mention your coauthor of the book. The coauthor of a book is shitty enrolling city and Morning Star and city and morning star is the ground son of rolling thunder. And he and I got together and we interviewed two dozen people who knew rolling thunder and told their stories in the book that we called the Voice of Rolling Thunder because Mickey Hart, the drummer of the grateful dead, his recorded several dozen speeches of rolling thunder over the years. And we got access to those tapes. And so we actually have the first original speeches laced through the book. And so we actually do have the voiceover length under, in the book is. There's no audio book though, is there? Oh, we are hoping there will be an old.com. Let's get on that. Yeah, you've got the original tapes there. That's fantastic.

Speaker 3:          00:48:28       That's amazing. Um, you, you were very fortunate enough to see the, a psychedelic hysteria of the sixties and see it manifested in, in law in was in 1970. This sweeping it's schedule one psychedelic act that was passed. What was the impact on culture? I've always found it was one of the most fascinating areas for this country and even humanity that we can study the, the, the distance between the fifties and the sixties. Like there's never been a time that we could ever look at where there's been such a gigantic radical change that you can really attribute a big part of it to psychedelics in this country.

Speaker 6:          00:49:11       Yes. And also psychedelics of course, should be put down by the political establishment today, but without the psychedelics, you would have had the, uh, smart investors who are responsible for the intranet, for the cell phone, for the smartphone, for computers, etc. Etc. Etc. Dna replication. I mEt carrie mullis a couple of weeks ago at ted. He won the nobel prize in chemistry for coming up with the pca. Yeah, exactly. Kary mullis mollison. He gives Due credit to his work with lsd. I met fraNcis crick And he gives you credit for his lsd sessions for the double helix. So there are many adventures outside of the electronics that made changes, much less the difference in style, the difference in music, the difference in sexual behavior. And historians when they write about that area, do not really give enough credit to what the psychedelics did in the role that they played.

Speaker 3:          00:50:13       No, they don't do that. it's a, it's a weird thing. So they try to avoid it.

Speaker 6:          00:50:18       They try to avoid it because they're afraid it will get censored. And often a musket censored. I know of cases where journalists written about the role of lsd and other psychedelics and social change in their editors. Have a whiteboard that out of the article and I'll put the article young without due credit to lsd. Now you don't get this at all, the alternative press and you certainly don't get this in the show such as yours, which are for a wheel and don't have censorship involved with them, but of course I saw all of this firsthand. I knew Albert Hoffman. He was a very dear friend of mine. He should have won the nobel prize and he would have if lsd had been allowed to take its aCtual course and help people in psychotherapy and creativity of dying and dignified death, but lsd fell into the wrong hands that was victiMized by the government and poor Albert Hoffman was very grieved by this.

Speaker 6:          00:51:22       He wasn't grief for not getting enough honor himself, but he had a tool here that could be very, very helpful to people. And then you had the extremists. Like my old friend timothy leary, who I liked very much, but who I disagreed with going to one extreme and saying lsd for all. And then the government on the other hand saying lsd for nobody. It's a dangerous thing. And people like Richard Nixon, he's saying timothy leary is public enemy number one, the most dangerous man in America. And where was the middle ground? People like Jean Houston, robert masters, sydney colon osher, yannick [inaudible], some of the pioneers who I knew very well of that era. There were cop completely eclipsed and they were cut off from legit have the supplies of lsd.

Speaker 3:          00:52:08       The work with lsd. The work that uh, francis crick did with the double helix dna. That's very controversial, isn't, it? Wasn't that on his deathbed that he said that he, uh, he come to these conclusions was very old. This is actually after I met him

Speaker 6:          00:52:25       when he talked about lsd. And of course we don't know the role that, that actually played in something as complicated as The double helix. Remember tHat his parked or watson deserves equal credit. We never know how much credit to give to somethiNg like that and it's a source. It's a source of a creative person will try many things. Um, I interviewed track zappa for an article I wrote about the influence of psychedelics on art and music and he says, I don't know what role psychedelics played with my music and artist and musician will go to many sources and we'll pull from life experiences for many sources. And so no, you never know exactly all we can say. It didn't seem to do with any herb.

Speaker 3:          00:53:16       The harm francis crick. Did he tell you himself that he had. No, this was after I met him. After he met him, we had a full conversation, but

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       this was years after I met him that he made the statement about lsd because a michio kaku wouldn't admit that I had a conversation with him on the opiod anthony show and I asked him about francis crick and he completely poopooed instead. It's nonsense and he's of the belief that psychedelics are bad for the brain and give you brain damage. Really kind of a disappointing point of view when I, when I talked to him because I, I recognized right away that he had never had any experiences with them himself. It was just purely a, a standard sort of academic. And uh, he didn't believe it at all. He said that it was not true in the newspaper this morning. There was a statistic though, the within the last 12 months, 170,000 people have died from prescription drugs. Okay. How many people have died in the last 12 months from marijuana? How many people have died in the last 12 months from an overdose of lsd?

Speaker 3:          00:54:20       Yeah. it's ridiculous because it's also when you are a mainstream academic, like a guy like michio kaku, you almost have to talk bad about marijuana and illegal drugs and you almost have to ignore the dangers of PresCription drugs. It's reAlly not something that you have, there's, there's, there's no benefit in, in his career toward, for him taking a controversial.

Speaker 2:          00:54:46       Yeah. But you know that that's like halliburton. That's like some executive at halliburton. Yeah. You know, it's like you can stand up and say the truth, especially these days is you and I were talking about the other day, you know, the internet has changed the whole communication and the gatekeepers getting edged out of the picture. I mean, andrew weil who's a mutual friend of stanley and me, uh, you know what I'm talking about, a medical doctor, a,

Speaker 3:          00:55:10       he was the guy with the white.

Speaker 2:          00:55:11       Exactly. Yeah. It's on the cover of time magazine and all this, right? His first three or four booKs are all about consciousness and he very openly talks about his use of Mushrooms and iowasca and you know, he's ecstasy and he's done all these things that he talks about, his experience he took and he's very balanced. The dudes harvard Med school, residency at mass general national institute of health, like top, top, top. And I interviewed him a few months ago and so he's like. And I said to tHem, I really admire the fact that you've never run away from that and you never said, oh, I was young and stupid. Like, no, the dude is very courageous about it. And hey, his career is doing fine.

Speaker 3:          00:55:49       Terence mckenna had a great quote about psychedelics that he said that oftentimes people are doing the work for the man and that you're worried about the man and in worrying about the man you actually doing the work of the man himself. Right. You know, being that you're censoring yourself and that you really, you don't have to censor yourself nearly as much. You know, I, I'm in a weird field. I'm a standup comedian, but I'm also a sports commentator. I do the commentary for the uLtimate fighting championShip anD it's on fox tv and it's on know fx. It's on the paper view and it's a, it's a multibillion dollar business, but I'm very open about psychedelics and I'm very open about the positive aspects oF them that I've experienced myself and I've been very fortunate that I've had other jobs like standup comedy to always fall back on that I never needed to worry about censoring myself and I never saw.

Speaker 3:          00:56:43       I never thought about it, but I've experienCed a lot of frustration from various people from agents and producers and executives were there. Like what are you doing? Like what are you thinking that this is going to hurt the big picture. This is going to hurt the package is going to hurt the things that I'm connected to. It never has. It never has never got pressure from fox or anybody don't know. Well, you know what? Here's the thing. Debate me, sit down, sit down, sit down with me and let's discuss what is, what is the real issue that, that's a problem here. Is it illegality? Well, do you understand the roots of the illegality? Because it's not based on science. It's based on hysteria. It's based on worry. It's based on fear is racism, but surely when you talk about marijuana, it propaganda and, and really, uh, it was uh, based on the suppression of hemp as a commodity really didn't even have anything to do with marijuana as a psychoactive drug.

Speaker 3:          00:57:33       So anybody who wants to sit down and debate with me, you're just gonna reinforce my point. I've talked about this and I've read too much about this to, to, to step back. It's, it seems to me, and he will be able to speak on this because you've seen this happen, you were there from the fifties and sixties that the psychedelics, the change that psychedelics can impart human beings, aLthough I think anything can be abuSeD. I mean, I think any humans have a propensity to overindulge in almost any sort of behavior, positive, ordinary people get addicted to love. I mean, people can get obsessed with relationships that could, you know, under the control of someone with discipline or with the, you know, someone who has a grip on reality. It could be a great thing. We, we have this ability to fuck any out. but overall I think psychedelics have an incredibly positive effect on people overall. You know, if you look at the broad spectrum of users and talk about johns hopkins had a recent paper that they published about the longterm effects of suicide in use in, in, um, these people that took it were enhanced the personality 20 years later. One mushroom trip,

Speaker 6:          00:58:49       right? Yes. This is one reason why I'm glad that I am in mainstream academia. I don't have to worry about these things. I teach at saybrook university, which is very open minded, which allows people to do their dissertations on iowasca, on lsd, even on telepathy and we're completely accredited. Prehistoric sexuality. YeS. Chris ryan is one of our most distinguished graduates and wrote his dissertation on sexuality. Saybrook university

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       is where whereas san francisco

Speaker 6:          00:59:24       online university, people from all over the world can get them to credited master's or doctor's degree by doing work through their computer, through the internet, through skype and half person to person conversations with me and other faculty members

Speaker 3:          00:59:38       should have left san francisco. San francisco is the free capital of this country. Always will be.

Speaker 6:          00:59:44       Well, it's kinda, you know, and it gets back to your point about the, the cultural effect of psychedelics in the sixties, right. It san francisco is the place that's still vibrating a little bit

Speaker 3:          00:59:53       from this. It's still ringing. The gong still has the, the. I lived in san francisco from the time when I was 11 until I was 13, or actually, excuse me, seven to 11. Um, and uh, it was a fascinating time because it was a, when the Vietnam war was ending and a san francisco was unlike any other place in the country. I didn't know it at the time, of course, because I was only seven years old, but we went from New Jersey, which was this barbaric shithole to san francisco and then went from san francisco to Florida, which was another barbaric shit. All. So it was, it was really interesting. I didn't know what the word nigger meant until I was 11 years old. I didn't, I never heard it. I've never heard in san francisco. I mean the people don't believe that, but there was, I didn't experience racism.

Speaker 3:          01:00:42       I went to school with black kids, asian kids. everybody was just a kid. Oh, this is bobby. His family's from Korea. This is mike. His family is black. There was no, there was no a weirdness to it until I went to Florida. And then my mother didn't believe me. I asked, I said to my mother, I said, I said, mom, what is nigger mean? And she said, you know what it means? And I go, no, I don't know what it means. Like, you know, my mother grew up in New Jersey, she probably heard it all the time, but when we lived in Florida it was the first time I'd heard it in school and I had to come to her and that she's like, it's a derogatory term for black people. And I was like, what? I was so shocked because from age seven to 11, I grew up in this really open minded, intelligent environment. You know, we, we lived near a lombard street. We were like in the heart of san francisco, gay neighbors like gay to me. And was like, oh, that guy's gay, this guy's tall. You know? It was like, it was just a part of life. San francisco is a just an amazing, amazing spot.

Speaker 6:          01:01:39       Yeah. Yeah. I love san francisco. You know, I want to hear more about your life. Every time I come on here, we're talking about me. In this case, we're talking about stanley, which definitely is entry, but I got to get you on my part.

Speaker 3:          01:01:51       We got plenty of time. I'll do it every year. More than happy. Yeah. My story is a weird one. it's very strange, but I'm the. One of the coolest things about the story is this, the podcast, the ability to have a guy like you on have a conversation for hours at a time. What was it like? Did you. Were you living in san francisco during the sixties?

Speaker 6:          01:02:10       no, I was doing the dream telepathy research in New York city with my mom, these medical center during the 19 six years, but once I met becky hart, I would take a trip to san francisco a couple of times. You're in stay at his ranch and rolling thunder as well as all other members of the grateful dead and the other members of the rock community. Now they got a tour of haight ashbury, had friends in haight ashbury, so every time I came to san francisco I got myself immersed in the hippie culture. The psychedelic culture. LeArned a lot. Came back to New York city, put that knowledge to use in the research that we were doing, and then we actually ran out of money. I couldn't do the dream telepathy research anymore, but I got an offer to teach at saybrook university and that's when I moved to san francisco in the, uh, in the early 19 seventies.

Speaker 3:          01:03:05       So you moved there right after everything became illegal? Yes. That is correct. what was the effect on san francisco? the, uh, the, the change from.

Speaker 6:          01:03:15       Well, the effect was sort of negative. I'll know. I saw a lot of people who had been dabbling with psychedelics and then they switched to cocaine. Some of them switched to heroin and so the illegality had some very negative effect upon a lot of young people. Again, not to say that they shouldn't have the responsibility was there, their decision to turn to these harder drugs. But uh, the beautiful summer of love didn't last very long.

Speaker 3:          01:03:52       if I don't want to screw up everything, you know, um, as one of the. Did you know terence mckenna at all? Yes, I did. One of the other things that he said that I found really fascinating was that what we really learned from the, the sweeping psychedelic act of 1970 when they just made everything illegal was how easy it was, at least at the time to throw water on this revolution, this revolution from. I always use buddy holly and jimi hendrix as an example. I'm like, buddy holly was like a rebel in the fifties, you know, pig, pig, cu. You know why I feel blue. It's like so calm and then you go from that to voodoo child, you know? I mean early beatles too late beetle. Yeah. Very good one to hold your hand to fly on the wall. Risk of. Well, you know, I have a daughter.

Speaker 3:          01:04:44       One of my daughters is 16 and she's, um, she's really into the beatles. It's just sheer boyfriends. Was that time to be dead? I'm nice. I'm easy. I'm easy. I, I, you know, I, my feeling is boys like girls and girls like boys and if you're nice to them to seek out, I don't mind them. I don't, I really don't. I just, I don't have an attitude that there's something wrong with two kids making out or doing whatever they do. I guess I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I liked it and remember when I was 16,

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       my girlfriend liked it. It's like it's normal. I mean it's uh, it's certainly awkward and strange, but I'm not a scary dad to me at all. I'm very friendly. But um, she's a, she's an interesting kid and she's in love with the beatles and I'm. One of the things at her and I've been talking about was the difference between the beatles early stuff and then like the white album, like what this radical transformation and that this came about a lot of it because of their fascination with altered states of consciousness and then eastern religions which came directly out of that. Yeah, it's a real problem with the beatles though is highlighted by my good friend bill per, and that's fucking yoko ono. how did that. She is like the one, like if you wanted to say maybe acid is bad for you, what the fuck john? like what were you thinking? Man? I was just talking to my mom, yeah,

Speaker 8:          01:06:11       about this and I didn't know that. Like everyone hated yoko at time. Like I always thought everyone liked yoga, you know back then, but no, everyone hated the back.

Speaker 1:          01:06:20       see, that's the key to it because because he was such an original thinker, the fact that everyone was saying, john, you're wrong. Just makes him say fuck you. You want to see something cool. Pull up the video with bill burr on yoko ono. I'm going to bring my friend bill burroughs on tuesday. Yeah, one of the funniest guys in the world. Really, really hilarious comedian, but he was also a huge beatles fan and a huge chuck berry fan and one time john lennon got to play with chuck berry on television and John Lynn and brought yoko ono with him to play as well, and she sabotaged the entire performance. He started like screamiNg into the mic and bill berg goes absolutely crazy about this and highlights and it's. It's, it's one of my favorite videos on the internet when it comes to music and here I will play it for you right now

Speaker 8:          01:07:17       as much as people talk about the beatles and how great their music is was whatever you want to say. I totally agree with them. I think that the greatest band of all time, but I have to be honest with you. John lennon and paul mccartney redefined pussy whipped. You have to watch this fucking video. It's john lennon is singing with chuck berry. Chuck berry is probably one of the main reasons why john lennon, lennon ever picked up a guitar, so now he's on tv. he gets to play with his idol. They're playIng a chuck berry's hit memphis. Okay. John lennon's got yoko in his fucking band there in the middle of singing this song on television and they're killing it. It's going great. Yoko's playing some stupid fucking drunk even though she has no talent whatsoever. He's putting her in the fucking band. Just she'll, she'll shut the fuck up and stop nagging me.

Speaker 8:          01:08:11       too much of a fucking pussy to tell her that she has. No, no. All right, the only reason why you're here yoko's because you're sucking my dick. All right. No, you can't play the bongos. But anyway, she's up there playing the bongos, right? John lennon, chuck berry, two of the greats of all time harmonizing singing this hit from the 19 fifties. That's what this moment's above. And yoko in the middle of it can handle that. She's not getting any shine. She takes the fucking microphone out of the stand, starts playing the bongo and as this thing and you know, go go johnny go. Whatever. She picks up the mic and I swear to god goes some fucking crazy shit. And you see open as wide as they are and it's that. It's that fucking look like a buddy of yours. And he's, he's, he's dating some fucking psycho, but he's in love with her so you can't fucking say anything and you're just sitting there waiting for the fucking lightning bolt to hit your friend in the head where he finally realizes that he's dating a psycho chuck berry.

Speaker 8:          01:09:15       BuT that's what the fuck she did. And chuck berry's like, what the fuck? And it's kinda like john, that's your woman get her in line and john lennon does not even fucking, he doesn't even blink. He just, he just keeps playing and then she does it again later on in that song. And then you look at all the other musicians and they just keep playing the song like yoko isn't even fucking there. And uh, I actually get infuriated when I watched this video. The fact that john didn't just stop playing in that moment and what he should have done was dressed or down right there. Yes. I find you want to have a fucking moment. This is your mom. If you ever fucking do that again. I was slacking. So fucking heart and the head. Your eyes are going to look like mine. You understand me? You play that fucking buying. When you shut your face, you bitch. You crawled out of the fucking well and ring. You understand me? I don't mean to. Why I'm fucking. You are going to be fucking anybody. You can't play the punk bongos. You can't say shut your fucking face. and then he just walks back up to the mic. And just counts the band back in, right? Is that what the fuck he should've done.

Speaker 1:          01:10:27       There's no perfect people. That's what it is. We have to accept that all of our idols are flawed. And even the great john lennon, beautiful musician and powerful cultural figure as he was, had terrible tasting lemon.

Speaker 6:          01:10:39       Well I happen to like yoko ono's are. How dare you. How dare you sir? Hers of mom. I and I thought it was extremely original and very provocative. now I don't like what she did with the chuck berry. John lennon do wet. She was not completely without tell.

Speaker 1:          01:11:01       I went to see the yoko ono art exhibit when I lived in boston and one of the things that she had was a block of wood with nails in it and a bag of nails and a hammer and she encouraged to participate in her art and that's what she wanted to do when you walk by, just pick up a nail and and whack it in. And that was art and what I had the joke was if she really wanted to encourage people to participate, she should take the nails and put them in her forehead and there'll be a fucking line around the block. It would be like that scene from airplane with a nun, with the guitar and boxing gloves. Everybody will be winding up. It take a slam and one of those dumb nails.

Speaker 5:          01:11:39       But I should also mention that I had the great fortune of hearing the beatles at their shea stadium concerts, I should say. I saw the beatles because you couldn't hear a word they were saying there were so much screaming from their fans.

Speaker 1:          01:11:51       Oh wow.

Speaker 5:          01:11:52       And so I also use the beatles in some of my articles about the influence of psychedelics on art and music. And you're absolutely rIght. They did make a switch thanks to psychedelics there work with the maharishi, the influence of eastern religions. George harrison taking up the guitar, you know, like musicians. They changed the. Have they evolved sometimes for the better sometimes for the worse. But I think in the beatles case, they were venturing into new and unexplored territory.

Speaker 1:          01:12:26       They were two artists, you know, they were really expanding and they weren't worried about, you know, sticking to their sound, you know, whether it's their acdc sort of riff like, you know, the signature rifts and acdc. I love acdc, but damn, he can hurt here an acdc sign a mile away. Once you hear it, you know, it's an acdc song. The beatles really, really went out there and they took a lot of, like really crazy chances with some of their stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:12:50       Yes, I did. And I met rolling thunder through mickey hart of the grateful dead because rolling thunder song was living in the haight ashbury and he nuts. Some of the grateful dead. And when his father rolling thunder came to town, he made the connection. This is all told about our book, the voice of rolling thunder. And that is how rolling thunder got to meet bob dylan and participated in the rolling thunder review. And so there's a lot of rock and roll stuff that's part of the rolling thunder legends

Speaker 1:          01:13:26       yesterday in the car in stanley. And I were talking about some of the musicians he's known over the years and he mentioned that hendrix was opening for the monkees. Whoa, you are talking about getting blown up the stage.

Speaker 5:          01:13:42       Take my stepchildren to hear the monkeys because they loved the monkeys and jimi hendrix opened for the monkeys and I told them he is going to be a major rock and roll star. Never forget that name. And they didn't. And a few years later the monkeys were forgotten. And jimi hendrix was a classic poor monkeys. Yeah. They didn't do so badly. They each went onto their own career. They, you know, found please.

Speaker 1:          01:14:13       No big deal. I mean they were fine. They were cute. I like the monkeys. When I was a little kid, one of the first, a fake bands. They were like the first boy band. Really essentially the manufactured boy band. Now when you see like the, the, you know, back in the day where it was the beatles and you know, and elvis and they, that was the teeny bopper thing. And now you see like justin bieber, isn't that sort of a sign of the times, you know that that's the teeny bopper now it's Like the, the teeny bopper is an 18 year old that looks like a 12 year old girl. Yeah, girl. He's looking for any sings like a girl, you know, it's, it's, it's very odd. Like wow, we're in this really strange time of almost like a suspended adolescent suspended childhood. Like they want to contain it and carry it and he sort of the ideal spokesperson for that. And I wonder, I don't know enough about the history of fashion and so on to know whether this is true or not. But it seems like since the late eighties, nineties, somewhere we started like circling in terms of fashion, right? Like disco came back, you know, and very briefly, pat bell bottoms, barely. They tried to come back to. Yeah. But it seems, doesn't, it sort of feels like, like we've come to the end of the line in some way. So now they're trying to circle around and reduce stuff.

Speaker 6:          01:15:32       Oh, there's nothing new under the sun. You know what's old today is new tomorrow and this is just part of the fashion cycle that's been happening for centuries. I think that what's most interesting and even a little bit dangerous as the prolonging of adolescents with adults, right? Adults who are acting like they're teenagers. I don't Have any problem with justin bieber or any of the teeny bopper, favorites yellow, that's their thing and they're welcome to do it, but when adults start to act like teenagers and start acting out and start to behave irresponsibly, I think this is where people really have to grow up, especially with all of the crises in the country and the crises in the world,

Speaker 1:          01:16:16       like what do you. What examples to use like adults acting like teenagers

Speaker 6:          01:16:20       years. I think that there is a tendency for some adults to look at theIr kids as pals and say, oh, my daughter is my best friend. I'm her best friend. Well, this is nonsense. You're the mother. You're not the best friend of your daughter. You lay down the rules, you give them instructions. You teach your daughter how to become an adult. You teach moral codes. You teach rules, you teach regulations, you serve as a role model. What's this best friends? Crap, all of them.

Speaker 1:          01:16:51       You can't be both. You can be a best friend as well as a role model. Someone who lays down.

Speaker 6:          01:16:58       I would not say never. All that I could say is that role confusion is not really part of parents.

Speaker 1:          01:17:04       What about when you see like a man in his thirties and he sagging his pants? Have you witnessed that? Yes. How about that? Is that the weirdest thing ever? You've seen some shit and your day. Just the sagging pants thing really makes me worry about the future of humanity. Grown men, grown men that are probably going to have babies of their own. See this justin? Nothing wrong with this. Polo except for a stupid baggy pants sagging and you understand that. Burn, that sagging.

Speaker 6:          01:17:30       Is that what that is? Yeah, they all sag thai fishing with justin bieber having saggy pants. I have troubLe with grown men having Saggy pants trying to be teenagers. What the fuck is that about?

Speaker 1:          01:17:42       I know a Dude, he's. I love him to death, but wheN he was like 39, he starts sagging his pants. I was like, come on son, and that's just when you need something to hold your balls up. Anyway. Yeah. That's when they start going. Maybe that's what it is. You just didn't want the tickle. The parents hitting the base of his balls as his balls dropped. He tried to compensate. It's like a comb over with his pants were silly and I think, uh, there's a, there's a prolonged silliness or from the seventies to today, but I think that what's going on today, over the last decade or so as I think that even though there's still plenty of silliness, like justin bieber, and again, I have nothing against justin. He's a child and he makes music for other children and you know, who knows, maybe one day from now we'll look back and say, well, this was when justin bieber was a child. Now look, he's this brilliant adult musician making this really cool shit and are sure. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:18:37       happened to ricky martin. He was part of the noodle. This boy's bound from puerto rico. Who would have guessed that he would become a broadway star and a brilliant broadway

Speaker 1:          01:18:47       is easy on broadway now.

Speaker 6:          01:18:49       Yeah. She just said les miserables. He is an a and I saw him in las vegas. One of the best acts I've ever seen in las vegas. She's a marvelous musician. He's gotten rave reviews for his role in a bed where he plays shake lavar of all people.

Speaker 1:          01:19:03       Stem kripner, ricky martin fan. Absolutely. Now you know, he's full of stuff, right? You live in la vida loca. I just want to know. Oh, absolutely. Great to live in love. You know, he's a talented guy. Nothing wrong with that, you know. And uh, and finally out of the closet too, I think that's another, another beautiful thing that.

Speaker 6:          01:19:24       Well he's commanded for that. And lady gaga who I also like, she has born that wave that probably saved the life of dozens of gay and lesbian kids.

Speaker 1:          01:19:36       Yeah. That's a sad, sad, sad thing about this world is that that's still an issue. You know, in the wild is gay marriage debate is going on. You know, who knows what kind of creepy shit getting passed through congress. It's not even getting public recognition. Everybody's paying attention to whether or not people should have the right to do whatever they want sexually with someone who also wants to do with them. So it's a strange thing that I always sort of say it's like, it's almost like a cultural beach ball. You know, if you're in a concert and someone throws a beach ball and it goes up and comes down, like, you know, it's like nothing ever fucking happened. It just kind of gets tossed around. Like, what do you think about gay marriage? You know, just like, oh no, what do affirmative action and nothing ever gets fixed, but they just get sort of tossed around back and forth. whenever this.

Speaker 6:          01:20:22       I'm going to go back to sharmane because in shamanic traditions around the world, what we would call gay and lesbian people were given a great deal of honor. Many of them became dancers, singers, even shamans and native americans. Not 100 percent, but most native americans said, look, here's somebody who acts like a woman likes members of his own gender or her own gender. Depending on which one you're talking about, the great spirit must have devoted some very special time to making them that way, so we have to give them special honor and respect them. Now the europeans came in, oh, that's terrible. Let's get the inquisition on them, and they killed what we would call gays and lesbians. They killed shamans. They killed them sometimes very, very brutally, and at the same time, the europeans gave much less power to women than the native americans did. Native americans gave a lot of power to women in their governing councils, in their decision making and in their families. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:21:33       Nowhere american came over. The europeans came over and storm the place because checks were running everything.

Speaker 6:          01:21:39       Yeah. that's the greatest genocide in the history. Probably a million native americans died in north America. Ten millions died in south America. Mainly through disease.

Speaker 1:          01:21:49       Yeah, it's a. It's the weirdest story. If you stop and think about how quickly it changed here in America, in north America from the time the columbus and you know from the, the 14 hundreds to the, you know, the nIneteen hundreds or whatever today, I mean it's an insane episode of genocide

Speaker 6:          01:22:13       to be that way. There's pretty good evidence that the chinese came to the pacific coast and even further down in maybe the early 14, hundreds maybe earlier and they were there to learn from the people to take samples back to China. They didn't and they didn't say, this is going to be part of China. We're going to make these people under good buddhists. They respected what they did and they got their information and they'd sell it back to China. No, the europeans who were there to brIng people to the true religion, they were there to trade, to get gold, to get mark, to get first, to enrich the old world At the expense of the new work.

Speaker 1:          01:22:55       It is an amazing time though, if you look, if you look at a timeline, like an animated timeline of the world and then showed north America and north America from the of the first europeans

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       and then this massive change that takes place over this continent over the course of the next several hundred years, gigantic cities just to rub the biggest cities in the world has ever known military complex builds up in nuclear bombs, start getting developed. You know, tHe internet airplanes, all this shit happens in this one continent. I mean there's this one continent. Essentially the last big continent to get established by human beings becomes the craziest motherfucker have. Out of all. You know, it's. It's really weird if you look at it from a historical timeline, the massive amount of impact that these immigrants have had coming over from europe and other parts of the world to this one spot.

Speaker 6:          01:23:48       YeaH. It could have happened a different way. What we call Mexico city, what they called a kyoto or calm or turn up slot and Mexico. That was a bigger city than london and the sewers were clean. The spaniards came. They couldn't believe how clean the city was, and then of course they ruined it at all. How they ruined it, they ruined it all because they wanted gold and they took the spaniards ruined it and they took botha zuma, they a tortured him. They killed him even though he filled a room full of gold with them. The same thing happened in Peru with pizarro and whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Here. That, there were these great empowers with magnificent cities, magnificent libraries. THe mayan libraries were all burned to the pieces. We don't know the mayan wisdom because the preset, all of that, this pagan stuff, we have to get rid of it. So there was a very, very different mentality that as you say, completely changed things and then things tend to start all over again. It took a much different routes.

Speaker 3:          01:24:52       well, the, um, the aztecs did some fucking crazy shit themselves,

Speaker 6:          01:24:56       say sacrifice, but at the same time, the iNquisition in Spain and in Germany and in parts of France and Italy, we're also killing people by burning them at the stake. I don't let the aztec soft for the human sacrifice, but you know, let's be fair. Let's look what happens with the other part of the world.

Speaker 3:          01:25:15       Yeah. Didn't they sacrifice like, I think over the course of like, I'm going to look it up. I think over the course of four days, they sacrifice some insane number of 80,000 people. Um, the, uh, the pyramid of tea. I don't know how to ican after they, um, in 14, 87 after the construction of it, they sacrificed all the prisoners that they use to make it 80,000 people who.

Speaker 6:          01:25:43       And one reason that they did all of the sacrifices is they thought that the gods were angry at them by bringing in the spaniards and bringing in all of the diseases started to kill people off. So like I say, no, I'm not listening to the aztecs offer the sacrifices. That was a flaw in their civilization that the very important for. But they did create clean and beautiful cities and they did have a forum

Speaker 2:          01:26:09       of government that work and they, the artwork and the streets where you mentioned the sewage, they had sewer systems. And they also had a, the streets lit at night, if I remember correctly, three seats for the night and you're going to lamps or something like that. I don't know. Do you know they weren't gas lamps for sure. Probably tortured, but it was built. It was an island in the middle of a big lake and it only had like one or two causeway. So it was perfectly defendable. But they'd invited cortez and his guys in. It was such a mess. And one of the theories that you might know more about this than I do, but I'm the vikings came down to north America much earLier, like the 10th century or Something. AnD one of the theories was that they had gotten this far south as Mexico because there was a myth that the. There was a white god that came from the east and said he'd returned someday. And so when they found, when the spanish showed up, they're like, ah, you know, it's the second coming. Well, the viking is of course are now memorialized by the current tv series, which is not bad by the way. It's really. And they just start the advice. It's good. Yup. And the

Speaker 6:          01:27:20       kings had a very, very important impact on not only europe, but yes, they came and visited the north America. they didn't kill off native american indians. They collaborated with them. They learned from them. They had their colonies. Then things got a little too chilly and cold and uncomfortable. So they sailed back, but they did not leave the legacy of destruction and disease that the english and the spaniards and the portuguese did much later on. And one interesting thing about the white god legend is that when the core cast came, he came at just the right time. The legend was the 30th day of the 30th month, the white god will come. And so every time in that cycle that the white god was supposed to come, they had scouts on the gulf of Mexico believable. Not cortez came just when the prediction was there and they welcomed him with open arms. I think it was one of the cruelest coincidences, the history of humankind that became a just the right time. So he was welcomed.

Speaker 2:          01:28:28       You think that's a coincidence though? I'm, I'm, I'm not into mysticism, so I would say that that was either a coincidence or else they got their facts wrong. Well, you're not in the mysticism, but yeah, you are. You are. If you're talking about this psychic dreaming, that mystic, I considered that quantum physics. I think this is something that ultimately be. We'll be explainable in terms of enlarge rural deal. You don't think that there's a possible connection that may be mean. do you believe that there's a for the

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       world? Do you believe that it's possible that you know all these things that are foretold that come to be true?

Speaker 5:          01:29:08       absolute bullshit. One hundred percent bullshit. I think that. See, I come from the point of view of evolution, watch adaptive watch. Adaptive is not always for the best of the world. If we were to have an atomic bomb blast who would adapt? It would be the young sex. Humans would be gone. insects would be the ones who survive because they could adapt. They could withstand the atomic bomb.

Speaker 1:          01:29:34       Key points and key three. My point though is that as you saw the kennedy assassination in a in a psychic vision, is it possible that these people saw the cortez in a psychic vision or who was often referred to as a white beard in god?

Speaker 5:          01:29:52       It was counseled people who according to the legends sailed off into the gulf of Mexico and said, I will return around. Just like douglas macarthur said, I should've returned during the second world war except capsule was a mythical figure, and again, he he not only said that he would return, but the Legend SpecifieD when in the cycle he would return. Now that has this incredible coincidence that I'm not going to explain. I'm just going to point it out.

Speaker 1:          01:30:23       Yeah, I mean, I would think though that if you're willing to consider the possibility that you had this vision of kennedy, he might consider the possibility of long range visions that people, these, these aztecs and mayans are sitting around taking mushrooms, contemplating the future might have a vision of these white men showing up.

Speaker 5:          01:30:42       Well, why not? Yellow time is a social construct and native americans have the, at least before the europeans arrived, they had the concept of the long body that our physical body is the short body, but the body extends into the future. Now that long bodies can sometimes pick up information from the future that it brings back to the short body. This is part of his metaphorical, but to them it would be no surprise when rolling thunder talked about global warming and when he talked about desertification and the pollution of the air, he was basing this on his observation of what was going on, but also he was going back to native american prophecy.

Speaker 1:          01:31:30       I love that term. Long body in short potty. That's really fascinating.

Speaker 5:          01:31:34       Oh, the native americans said all sorts of concepts that are consistent with quantum physics. We devote a whole section of quantum physics and our book about rolling thunder, the voice of rolling thunder and there is an entire book called blackfoot physics, which takes the blackfoot indian tribe, shows how closely their philosophy of the earth corresponds to modern day quantum physics. So book by david pete, who's a quantum physicist themselves,

Speaker 3:          01:32:04       what do they attribute the this, this information from like the black feet say, how do they learn these concepts

Speaker 5:          01:32:11       passed down over the generations. You can see some of it and the rock carvings, but mainly the myths and legends that have been passed down. Remember that most of the native americans did not have a written language. The mayans had the very good rep language, but it didn't do them, and you're good because the spaniards berg, all of their books and so this was passed down from tribe to tribe, from person to person from atlanta clan, and you can see it today and the legends that they talk about how the earth and how the people in the earth are part of a whole and how hard of a swerve a change can have ripple effects that affect the entire organism, the entire family, the entire clown, the fire in the entire cosmos. I'm also gonna talk about parallel universes, which was a quantum physics concept. They talk about the upper world, the lower world, the middle earth.

Speaker 3:          01:33:08       I'm going to throw something out at you and tell me if this makes any sense because this is something that I've been contemplating myself over the last few years and that that's the idea that human behavior, even the most complex and in self destructive of all human behavior is natural and that like we see complex social communities in wolf tribes and wolf packs and with, uh, with various animals and we see the way they interact and we say, oh, this is just nature. This is the way to sort things out on a much more complex scale. Is it possible that all the self destruction, all the, the crazy battles for resources that we've seen in the world today, that all of this is in fact just a natural behavior pattern. And it's literally the only way that human beings exist in that this strange, a contrast between massive amounts of information being available and being spread rapidly back and forth between people and all these horrible injustices that are all going on. At the same time, it's, that's the yin and the yang of human humanity.

Speaker 5:          01:34:11       That's a good way to put it. This is the yin and the yang. The balance. People are neither good nor bAd. They're both and the way that society constructs their behavior, conserve them one way or the other,

Speaker 3:          01:34:26       and also that like while we're doing battle with these evils, this is what propels innovation. THis is what sort of propels people to move forward. That if we lived in some sort of a utopian, you know, beautiful society of orgiastic love, that maybe we'd never get anything done and maybe that's part of what the human animals here for in the first place, like the aunt makes the ant hill. The b makes the honeycomb, the human being creates this uber complex society, one of the

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       mechanisms to ensure that society keeps moving forth at this breakneck speed is this conflict, this constant conflict that's going on, both social conflict, economic conflict, that all this is a part of this gigantic ever complex natural behavior pattern.

Speaker 6:          01:35:18       It certainly is natural, but don't overlook the other side of it. When you go to darwin and read what he had to say, he uses terms like love cooperation, collaboration much more often than he uses conflict. He sees this cooperation is what engineers evolution and social progress. He never used the word the words a survival of the fittest. Somebody else use that. He didn't like that term. He was more emphasis, more empathetic, um, collaboration and even love. Those are the words you find in his books.

Speaker 1:          01:35:58       When I, when I, when I speak of these things, when I'm, what I'm saying is almost like as if I was someone from another world, if I was looking at the human race, a completely objective, lee and I'm looking at what one of these crazy things doing and what direction and if we were trying to study them and trying to figure out what's causing all this stuff to be taking place at the same time, I almost would would look at it that way. Then it's like maybe it's, this is really complex natural behavior that's moving towards some sort of. It means seems to be some sort of technological integration. I mean it seems to be that that's what's the number one push. If we look at where it, what people are doing with innovation, with technology at all seems to be a connection between humans and technology. This symbiotic connection,

Speaker 6:          01:36:46       oh, this is a soul called singularity that you hear so much about where are the humans and the technological innovations are going to combine into a singular society or even a singular organism who knows and that might be adaptive. That might be a direction that humans couldn't go. And so I think you're on the right track. I think that this is a very innovative way of thinking, but let's talk about practicality and the listeners of your show at quite have to decide, okay, which side of history are you going to be on? Are you going to be on the side that the, uh, full mount suicide bombing and religious bigotry or you're going beyond the side, the facilitates love and human cooperation and care for children and women and men. Which side is better? Strip club,

Speaker 1:          01:37:36       which side has better strip clubs as the side of religious

Speaker 6:          01:37:42       collaboration. They have the better strip clubs up there on the side of beauty there on the side of love. No doubt about it.

Speaker 1:          01:37:51       Yeah. That's where you want to leave. What were you going to say? I was just gonna say when you're in your, your point, they're talking

Speaker 2:          01:37:55       about how to what extent this is natural human behavior. Keep in mind that anatomically modern human beings are. Most scientists would say about 200,000 years on the planet. Right? And until very until the last couple of hundred or a thousand, depending on how you want to look at it. They were living the same way forever and you know, like 40,000 years you'd get boeing arrow instead of spheres, you know, that would be the one technological advance, you know, and, and so there's been a lot of debate like what happened, why wasn't there more movement and progress and all this stuff. And at the moment the best theory I know of is that people were comfortable. There wAsn't any need necessity. The mother of invention. Right? So like there's plenty of food around blending. You look at, you know, how many hours hunter gatherer people spend working compared to us. They work a lot less than we do. So, you know, I, I see your point and I agree with, with what you're saying and the singularity, I think we're definitely going in that direction, but to say that it's a natural human behavior, we have to keep in mind that it's been a quantum shift in the very last seconds of human existence.

Speaker 1:          01:39:04       Isn't that sort of like almost like the rosetta stone. Like we figured out how to make metal and then we figured out how to conduct electricity and then we're off to the races and we just like, we put a couple of things together, the key pieces in the language of technology and that set off this,

Speaker 2:          01:39:19       but there's intentionality there. You're, you're attributing. Whereas I think it's a happenstance. I think it's a question of a population densiTy that we didn't ever choose. That's a quick. I get the question all the time, like if agriculture sucks so bad, why did we do it? As if we, you know, some guys were like, hey, why don't we start farming, you know, they wiLl, will make a deal. It happens. I'm reminded of this guy. This happened. You might have known about this in sonoma. There were some, uh, there at a winery and um, there's some tourIsts, they're getting ready to take balloon rides over the winery and they were setting up one of the balloons, hot air balloons and, and it started to pull away and the balloon guys were having trouble managing it. And a german tourist who was standing there ran over to help them and grab the basket of the balloon and then the balloon took off.

Speaker 2:          01:40:09       It broke free. And if you're a professional working with balloons, you never let both your feet off the ground. That's like the rule. If you're working with balloons once, both feet leave the ground, you let go. This guy didn't know that. So what happened? He went up, he hung on as long as he could. Then he fell. All his friends watching, he couldn't pull himself up in the parking lot. Oh fuck. Can't fight mother nature. You can't fight gravity, so that's, that's how I see at the advent of agriculture is like, you know, it made sense at the time and then you get tied into the loop. You can't get out, but

Speaker 1:          01:40:46       isn't that sort of the same pattern of complexity? It's we, we figure

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       out one thing that integrates us more deeply wIth each other and then from there that innovation leads to more innovations which lead to bigger buildings which lead to, you know, different irrigation methods which lead to larger supplies of food which leads to more people, which leads to more innovation because there's more people which leads to communication issues, which leads to the invention of phones, which I mean it's, it's this constant technological progression.

Speaker 5:          01:41:20       Yes, technical logical progression, but along with that comes pollution comes. Desertification comes global warming. That's the dark side,

Speaker 3:          01:41:30       but is that necessary? Is that not more of the yin and yang like the the solution needs to be acquired, like someone needs to figure out a way to have a sustainable sort of an urban environment like instead of this idea where we're constantly burning fossil fuels, there's other ways to extract energy. Why do not? Why? Why don't we have solar cities? We don't have. Why don't? Why isn't los angeles solar city? You want to talk about the dumbest fucking thing ever. Fly over downtown la. Everybody's operating on coal, power to electricity and this fucking sunlight everywhere. Three hundred and 60 days a year. it it rains for days a year out here and there's no solar panels anywhere in downtown la.

Speaker 5:          01:42:09       When I was at the university of Wisconsin back in the early 19 fifties while of our chemistry professors was preaching soLar power and nobody believed him, they thought he waS off the wall anD he even had invented solar panels, which other people had founded. Also, solar panels and solar power had been with us potentially since the late forties or early 19 fifties, but they were a threat to establishment govern reliance on fossil fuels. Now, so only now Are we waking up, well, we'd better go in that direction if we're going to avoid the destruction of the earth and most people still don't give that high priority, so the knowledge was there, but they were bypassed. Well, like the electric car, you know what happened to the original car? It just ran a foul of commercial interests, so a lot of these innovations that could have led to sustainability long time ago were bypassed and only now, maybe before it's too late, can we go back and bring those into fruition.

Speaker 3:          01:43:20       That brings us back to what we were talking about earlier with the hemp and the original issue with him being that hemp as a commodity where Henry Ford made the first body panels, have a car. They were made out of hemp. His car also ran on hemp fuel and this is the very first cars that Henry Ford created, and that's very little known fact that camp in in a fiber form when they turn it into body panels is actually stronger and Lighter than Steel.

Speaker 5:          01:43:47       Oh, hampers wonDerful. George Washington grew hemp by the way, and no, you try

Speaker 6:          01:43:52       to get government subsidies for hamp. you even tried to get legal permission to grow hemp and you run up against a brick wall.

Speaker 1:          01:43:59       Well, we own a part of a supplement company and one of the thIngs that we sell is hemp protein powder and we have to buy it from Canada. We can't grow it in the United States. We have to buy it from Canada and it's very popular and we can only get 50 pounds a day from these people because of the fact that it's so. It's so much in demand. It's really hard to to keep keep up with the demand and we. There's been laws passed and because Colorado and Washington state both passed laws legalizing marijuana, they also are trying to legalize hemp farming, but even though hemp is non psychoactive, they're still facing a massive backlash from the federal government and people are scared to pull the trigger and start farming. Even just hemp, just just fArming him, which is non psychoactive. Again, the cousin of the marijuana plant, you can't. You'll go to jail, they'll lock you up in a cage for growing a plant that's perhaps the most spectacular plant available to human beings on the planet earth today.

Speaker 6:          01:44:59       Yeah, it's the plant with the longest, a verified cultivation. It's the first thing humans ever cultivated as far as we know.

Speaker 1:          01:45:06       Isn't that like the best sign that we're crazy like that? That's illegal. I mean it's one of the best signs that we've

Speaker 6:          01:45:12       politically last script. The rational. I mean on top of everything the government does is out of money. I mean, tours of the white house are being curtailed. A flowers for the tomb of the unknown soldieR are not being placed and because of these stupid little budget cuts, why can't we grow hemp and tax it? Why caN't we grow marijuana and tax it? Just think of the tax revenues that would come in. You have all the money that wouldn't go to the drug warriors.

Speaker 1:          01:45:42       Is it shocking for you to have lived this long and seen us go from the fifties to 2013 and see where we're at today? Did you think that we'd be much further along by now?

Speaker 6:          01:45:53       No. I have always been very much of a realist and I have never been a utopian. I just sort of take what comes. I have seen human folly in one form or another and I've certainly come to some human folly myself, so I'm just made of course and I'm disappointed, but I wouldn't say I'm shocked.

Speaker 1:          01:46:13       If you could address the people of the world and urge them to move in one direction or the other. What what, what do you think would be the best method for change for this world?

Speaker 6:          01:46:24       Good heavens. I would never reach that pinnacle of publicity or success or egotism, but what comes to mind most quickly would say, be a little kinder to each other, be a lot kinder to each other. Right. If I were a little more enthusiastic, I would say it'd be a lot kinder,

Speaker 1:          01:46:47       less enthusiastic. What holds you back?

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       I would go one step at a time. Starting a liTtle kinder works and viola.

Speaker 1:          01:46:59       Yeah, and that's a psychedelic state of mind, isn't it? I mean, that's a psychedelic ideology. Yeah. I. that's one thing I've most certainly Learned from my experiences is that there's some sort of a strange connection between human beings and when we exercise that connection to, or I should say, when we respect that connection, honor that connection. It enhances the way you feel about life and enhancers to being kind to other people has a positive effect on you as an individual. It's like the universe reinforcing that sort of behavior.

Speaker 5:          01:47:30       Well, this really ties together matraville talking about, we're talking about shamanism and our book justifying shamans, shamans help the community be kind to each other, help the community work together. Shamans in terms like rolling thunder saw the need for communities all over the world who work together. Politicians haven't quite gotten that message yet. And the psychedelic ethos, if you want to call it that, is one of connectivity is one of kindness. It's one of seeing the hologram and which we all live.

Speaker 1:          01:48:12       It's interesting, the shamans and the, the term shamanism, almost all of it comes from much smaller populations. And uh, I think that may be a key to the issue is that we went in reaching like New York city, los angeles, you, you, these 10 million, 20 million city populations, you almost, there's almost too many people to manage. And the term shaman or the idea of a showman gets very weird when you're in a tribe of a few hundred people and you have one trusted man that you've known your whole life. You know his chAracter. You know what he's really all about. He's not, he's not trying to run some jim jones bullshit and start his own cult. But when you, when you have a million people and you have 10 million people, whatever you have, and you start calling yourself a shaman and you gather up a following and they come from all around, next thing you know you've got a cult.

Speaker 5:          01:49:08       This is why you don't cAll yourself a shaman. A community appoints you a shaman. If you call yourself a shaman, then you get into the whole cult mentality and you know what happens to cults? Usually they get out of hand and they elude to lead to the jim jones phenomenon. The mass suicide.

Speaker 1:          01:49:28       Yeah. Is it possible to avoid that? Can you have a nice cold? Is that something that people never figured out? Like, look, they didn't even figure out the airplane until the 18 hundreds. Right? Is it possible to figure out a nice colt?

Speaker 5:          01:49:40       I don't think you'd call it a cult because the word called has taken on a negative connotation. Right? But it doesn't have to be. I think you could have a nice cold. I'd have to strange biomet, straighten my imagination to think of one. But, uh, I would suppose a. Theoretically it's possible. Well, I caught the quakers were not really a cult because they never had a primary leader.

Speaker 1:          01:50:07       A so called assumes that personality at the center of it. Okay. Does it have to?

Speaker 5:          01:50:13       Well, that's the definition of cold focuses on a person. You could. Well, I, I hear a talk about the grateful dead cult now that certainly has been very beneficial during the era that the grateful dead were wrong with all of the deadheads and even though you had some people going off the edge at grateful dead concerts, bottled large was a loving, collaborative, cooperative group. And the grateful dead singers themselves certainly didn't preach violence and terrorism. They preached love and peace and joy and happiness. And you hear in the music that's called a cult. I would not use that term myself, but uh, that had a, not one person but a group of people at the head of it. And when the grateful dead ended, well you have the memories linger on and the members of the great how all doing useful and beautiful and artistic things on their own. Burning man.

Speaker 1:          01:51:13       Yeah. That sort of thing. Have you been to

Speaker 5:          01:51:15       burning man? Yes. Oh, you've been there. I have bounced or something like burningham burn burning man. I've built a, one of the smaller venues, but I don't think that you had called out a cult because that doesn't focus around a Particular person. I would call that a social movement, a social phenomenon.

Speaker 1:          01:51:35       I, uh, I could get down with the whole grateful dead thing set the music sucks. A kiss cam. Oh, that's a matter of taste. I'm only fucking around, but I have a degree

Speaker 5:          01:51:47       filled. They'll have their own archive. It was not their idea, but the university of California, santa cruz opened up an archive now that I was there for the ground debut of the, uh, of the collection. And they're doing a marvelous Job in terms of showing the whole chronology of what they called the grateful dead phenomenon. Add tHat the such a mosaic with knoll denier movement at all. It's a challenge to put that into what's going to be 24 rooms and they have gotten donations literally from all over the world and they've arranged it very, veRy tastefully. This is open to the public and there you can get a real taste of what a social Movement can do, an artistic movement. Also the how it can start and what that lead to.

Speaker 1:          01:52:42       Yeah, the. I think that in that it was a very positive movement and the dad sort of emphasized peace and love and that everybody would go around. My cousin actually follow the debt around for years and years and her and her boyfriend used to sell eggs and bacon from the back of their car. They had like a little grill and they would cook and the concerts and feed people and make beads and shit and do weird crafts and stuff and she was a full on deadhead for several years. Just followed them from venue to venue and that's a. I don't know how that happens. How does a band like that that happens for them, but it doeSn't happen for the rolling stones. It happens for, you know, it's, it's a strange thing.

Speaker 6:          01:53:21       That's the merry pranksters, right? They were the house band for ken keyes. Ease. She had a great deal to do with it. Right. And they used to go around in the bus right onwards and uh, they would go from town to town and do the, the, what they Call it, the electric koolaid acid test, so they would have concerts where they were alsO passing out acid, so they'd like pull into some town in Nebraska or something, You know, find a big field somewhere and everybody would come out, there'd be acid and the grateful dead would play. So the, from the very beginning, the altered consciousness was part of the musical experience. Wolfe's book, the electric koolaid acid test is really a very good chronology. And you didn't have other bands who had a key sheet sort of adopt them as a vehicle for his own creativity. Yeah. Did you ever meet ken keyes? Yes, I did. I've met volunteered girl who was the significant other of both Kentucky kishi and of Jerry Garcia monitoring girl was there for the debut of the archives. And her daughter is the one who on jerry garcia's dog or cut the ribbon to open the archives. No, that's a very important part of the history.

Speaker 1:          01:54:38       Mountain girl was Jerry Garcia. And ken keyes, his girlfriend at the same time?

Speaker 6:          01:54:43       No. No. A space between the two. There's a little bit of gap. Who got her first? I think that Jerry Garcia was Jerry Garcia. How many shifts have you been to [inaudible]? I've been to two, but I'm sure you've been to hundreds of grateful dead shows. Oh, not hundreds. You got to remember that I had a full time job at the time and I had a family to take care of. I estimate high to at least 50 years.

Speaker 1:          01:55:10       Wow. 15 grateful dead shows and yet still can hold a conversation. Say folks not propaganda has been

Speaker 6:          01:55:19       mainly at the shows, but he was onstage and finally yesterday he was telling me, sitting behind the drum drummers, looking out in one concert, a guy comes, sits down next to him. It's david byrne. Whoa. FIrst day, first time David Burnett ever been to a dead show. And you were his guy to educate david byrne about the grateful dead so that he could have an educated conversation with them after the show. Did you ever do any psychedelics with dolphins or did you ever experiment with that? Swim with dolphins, but I've never done psychedelics with dolphins. Not not necessarily being with dolphins as a high enough experience on themselves. Did you know john lilly? Yes. I knew him very well. Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:56:00       Yeah. Lily had some fascinating experiments with dolphins and psychedelics acid and the tanks. Sensory deprivation tanks. AbsoluTely. Did you get involved in the tank at all? Sensory deprivation.

Speaker 6:          01:56:11       Separate deficit. I've done sensory deprivation tanks in the lots of psychedelics because they had experiences good enough in and of itself. A lot of the experiences that I like in and of themselves and I don't need them to be augmented by psychedelics. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:56:29       I agree with that with the sensory deprivation tank, but I think it takes a little while to get get the hang of yes to relax and learn how to let go in there and really find those altered states of consciousness. I've had several people talk to me. I'm like, oh, I tried to tank a couple times that I really didn't trip my balls off. I'm like, wow, okay. You're not. Maybe I've described this running.

Speaker 6:          01:56:52       I don't to be to town talented here, but when I enter into these experiences, I do it with what chris just called intentionality on us. Okay, well, how am I going to learn from this experience? What am I going to take away from this experience that is beneficial to me, my friends and the world at large. Every time I've taken iowasca, I've written the what I've learned and I have gotten a very important lesson from each of my town iowasca sessions. The last session was so powerful. I'm still learning from him, still trying to put louis lessons into practice. How long ago was that? That was a year and a half ago.

Speaker 1:          01:57:33       Year and a half ago, and it was so powerful. You're still trying to

Speaker 6:          01:57:36       absorb it. Brazil. Very, very powerful.

Speaker 1:          01:57:40       What is the most profound thing you've learned from psychedelic experiences

Speaker 6:          01:57:44       if you had a most? I. I try not to play favorites because I've learned so much, but if you put me on the spot, I would say that human beings are not a part from nature. Human beings are part of nature, and when human being separate themselves from the rest of nature, they run a mock, they get into trouble, so living a natural life with the principles of nature of all of our relations is the way, not only to a happy life, but a fulfilling life and the meaningful life.

Speaker 1:          01:58:20       Do you think that our current state of ignorance, when it comes to that, is just a byproduct of us expanding from the world of primitive hominids to language, to explaining feelings and thoughts, to eventually understanding the full spectrum of our impact in the world.

Speaker 6:          01:58:40       You've put up very well and I'd like to put

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       that into the context of neuroscience and the brain. We've gotten ourselves into a situation where the western consciousness is focused in the frontaL lobeS anD in part of the left hemisphere of the brain. We ignore The reptilian brain, the medulla oblongata, the spinal cord. we ignore the penalty. All mammalian brain, the limbic system where the emotions come in. We've even, if you ignore the right hemisphere, except for lefthanded people, the right hemisphere is the holistic hemisphere where we see things as a whole. There's a complete gestalt. We are focused in the left hemisphere, which again, for everybody, but the lefthanded people, we can't leave them out there a little bit different. Focuses on linear thinking, on bits and parts and pieces, on reason, on down, on rational approaches to stuff, and we leave out imagination, intuition, emotion, all of the things that make a person fuLly human.

Speaker 1:          01:59:54       Yeah. That'S a very, very important point. You know, I, I, I think that science is an amazing aspect of our worlD and our ability to measure nature and understand the very just the building blocks of, of reality is really amazing stuff. BuT one of the things that science can account for his love can account for appreciation of art can account for the way you feel when a great song comes on. The radio, you know, can account for the, the, the, the beauty of a person's personality. So certain people that are just amazing to be around that you see them, you smile. It's like there's this immeasurable connection to passion and love that that human being share that's again to measurable, you know, you can't quantiFy, you can't write it down. You can't, and it's one of the most important aspects of humanity.

Speaker 6:          02:00:50       It is. I'm going to put in a plug for saybrook university beCause you are trying to expand the boundaries of science and say that there can be art based science, there can be love based science where people can use narratives to describe their experience route, can use neuroscience to figure out what's going on in the brain, the gut, the heart and the body and that's not going to completely explain all of this because you have to depend upon literature and the arts and poetry and painting to do justice to it, but at least we could do much more than we've done in the past with very narrow conceptions of science

Speaker 1:          02:01:32       and in teaching in saybrook university, you said that the courses were all available online, so people from anywhere in the world listening to this

Speaker 6:          02:01:40       sign. Of course they have to pay for the courses and register with you. Well, it depends upon the course. I would say people can go to our website, saybrook.edu, when they'll get the whole. How do you spell saybrook? S a y, b r o o k saybrook.edu. Yes. And they can find on how much everything costs. They can. I handle a course on actually a certificate course that anybody can take on the psychology of dreams and dreaming repeat after laurel how to work with dreams and learn the brain science behind dreams and dreaming. So there you have both the cycle neuro cycle, neurology of dreams and the neuroscience of dreams. But you have the art of dreams, the interpretation of dreams, the dreams make with the rest of the body and with the significant people around you. What about the connection between dreams and the body's endogenous production of how senate, like

Speaker 3:          02:02:37       dmt, like rick strassman's work on, uh, on, on, on dmt,

Speaker 6:          02:02:42       aware of us? Yes. Rick strauss would be great. Another great pie in your, you know, all the important people. I'm very, very impressed.

Speaker 3:          02:02:48       Oh, he's amazing. He's a good friend. I love that guy in his book, dmt. The spirit molecule is one in one of the most important books I've ever read. The, uh, the brain. Well, we don't really, I mean the law, everyone likes to say the pineal gland produces dmt and there's some anecdotal evidence to that, but we know bob just forget about where it's produced. We know it's made in the body. We know absolutely it exists in the human boDy aNd thAt it's one of the most transient substances known demand, meaning that when you take dmt in, especially in a smokable form, your body brings you back to baseline extremely quickly. And one of The weird things about the dmt experiences that it has a very similar effect to dream states in that they're very vivid immediately after the experience, but then shortly after just like a dream, you're like, god, what happened?

Speaker 3:          02:03:36       What was it? And it's almost in my humble estimation, like a protection mechanism, like your, your, your reality, the material world, knocking on things, weighing things. That reality is, it's so hard to combine the two, the hallucinogenic reality, the dmt reality is so bizarre that it's almost like the brands like, listen, bitch, you can't handle this. We're just going to erase that shit for you. You know? You know what I mean? How can you have. I mean, I've had many dmt trips in the most vivid ones. They're so incredibly powerful right after it happens, but they're gone within five minutes. You have to. If you don't record it, if you don't write it down, it's like most of the experience somehow or another slips out of your fingers. Well, of

Speaker 6:          02:04:27       course, shifting from one type of conscious to suit other type of consciousness is difficult. You're going to forget what you did. This is why when people wake up from the dream, if they don't try to found right away there, we're going to forget it, and even though they don't remember the entire dream. One nice thing about dreams. This involves the whole brain. This is why shamanism is so closely linked with dreams. Shamanism. The shaman uses the whole brain, the shaman through drugs, through dreams, through dancing, through drumming, etc. Uses parts of the brain that other people in the community do not use and in dreams you've got the emotions, you've got the reflexes, you've got these survival mechanisms and you've got the transcendent experiences all in one neat little package and if you don't write that stuff down and put it to use, you're going to forget it.

Speaker 1:          02:05:22       I do that all the time. I've been in bed and I have this hilarious idea and like, oh, I'm not going to forget that one. And I wake up in the morning and justin bieber. What about justin bieber all the time, right? It drives me nuts. Since the nineties I've been carrying these little recorders, these digital voice recorders because of that. Yeah, and that's been the bed every night under my pilloW sometimes because you just hit the button. You don't even have to wake up. Yeah, I'm going to have to start doing that because I record everything on my iphone, but then you got to open the iphone. Going to apps and the digital recording these things. Some of them you just plug it into the computer and it transfers it into text, right? Yeah. So yeah, transfers it into text so you don't have to listen and decide. That's a good one. That's a bad way. You just get a list. Yeah, that's a new thing. I didn't know that. That's good. Oh wow. That's a beautiful thing. Yeah. Yeah. Have you seen any of that? A voice to text software?

Speaker 6:          02:06:21       I've seen that a lot. I'd like to put it to use. I think it's a great advance.

Speaker 1:          02:06:25       Want to see something called watch. I'll show it to you right now. This is how amazing these things are. This is just a regular iphone. When you go into the notes application, when you go into the notes application and you want to make a note to get this little thing right here, that looks like a microphone. When you press that and you go, stanley kripner is a bad motherfucker, and then he'd be like that a butchered. You said stanley crypt. There is a bad motherfucker. And then. oh, because I said, oh yeah, well I trained it and trained it from motherfucker, but that's pretty good, so I bet you would do it again. Dr. Christopher Ryan is a bad motherfucker. There you go. Dr. Christopher Ryan is a bad motherfucker. Perfect. I have proof. Proof is there in the notes. Yeah. That must be an amazing thing to have witnessed, to see people going from textbooks to the internet to and to be able to hold a studies and to hold classes online.

Speaker 6:          02:07:33       That's true. This is why should you? Morning star and I worked so well together on their book, the voice of rolling thunder because he wants to round with his ipod, interviewing people and he has his own website, open source religion, which you're williston should plug into where people from different religious persuasions can come to a website and argue things out and discuss things on the internet without even meeting each other physically.

Speaker 1:          02:07:59       Some people from various ideologies can compare noTes as to who's crazier. That's a kind way of putting it. When you see like in them, after all you've been through it. When you see the shit that's going down with this, well, we have a new pope. Oh, and everybody lines up and all the major media and the news, they treat it like it's a real event. It's really mind boggling. You got a guy dressed up like a wizard who runs a, a whole clan of kid fuckers and they're taking it seriously. How come jerry, if jerry sandusky had been religiously ordained, would he not be in prison now? They would sneak them around. They would move him somewhere with that guy. One of the reasons why they had to get rId of the pope for folks who don't know is that the pope is responsible. The past pope, not the new one.

Speaker 1:          02:08:44       The past pope was responsible for having a man released who molested over 200 deaf kids. 200. He took him. I'm shielded him from prosecution and then moved to a new parish where he molested more kids. I mean, it's a huge, huge scandal and you're right. If jerry sandusky hadn't been involved in the religion of football, but instead was involved in religion of catholicism, you're very right. I bet he would be, he would be afraid. There's a lot of people that are free right now. Just be shifted to another team. Yeah. Well, one of the things they've done is they take people and they, they say they're punishing them by removing them from, from churches, and they bring them to these gigantic religious compounds when they have these beautiful grounds and his place in North Carolina where they took this, uh, this guy who was responsible for molesting dozens of kids.

Speaker 1:          02:09:35       You know, it's like they're criminAls. These horrible, horrible criminals and somehow or another we tolerate it. It's really a weird aspect of our modern culture and give them tax rate. Yeah, free free zero taxes if you're in the cult. I mean, well, do you know Alex Gray? Well, alex grey is a, he's got his whole chapel. That was a brilliant, brilliant guy and a beautiful human being. It's just a really loving. He was so funny we had on the podcast, anytime I'd say anything negative about anything, he just like, well, you have to. He would always find the positive loving side and not criticizing anyone. I'm like a joke and I'm a comedian, man, I don't really mean this. That's stanley stanley's the same way. And so over the years I was standing and I have known each other 20 years or something and you know, a lot. We talk about sex a lot, you know, we spent a lot of time on the road, he's talking about sex and it sadly to say, oh, I want to introduce you to so

Speaker 6:          02:10:34       and so. She's so beautiful and I'm thinking stanley stanley things. Everyone's beautiful. It's a beautiful thing. Well, you take in terms of, you know, beautiful in spirit, but alex great is a wonderful artist, but one of the reasons he's such a wonderful artist, he does take a very positive, optimistic view of people and of life and that shows up in his art and I think his art is spiritual. It's fantastic. I think he's, you know, historically very important and I've been impressed with his art from the beginning and his wife, his wife is equally talented. Those wonderful work.

Speaker 3:          02:11:18       yeah, she, she was with him when he came in into the podcast. He's a true visionary artists in the sense that he, in my opinion, is he has the most accurate representations of the tryptamine world. Like in painted form. Like I, when I look at his paintings, I see like tripping. I see like there's one of 'em, it's a gold one. It looks like to faroe heads, like there are facing in opposite directions. Like I literally, it seems like something that you would see if you were a, you were on dmt painting, brilliant, brilliant artist. He is actually achieved a tax exempt status because this chapel, the sacred mirrors, his, uh, his religion is actually being recognized as a true religion. Wow. Yeah. It's really interesting because he's in sort of a, like locally, they don't want to recognize it. Like they want the tax money from him and he's like, well listen though, I'm a religion, like I am tax exempt and if the methodists are tax exempt and the catholics at tasks, why, why not the chapel, the sacred marriage.

Speaker 3:          02:12:22       And you know, he's like sort of duking it out with these people in his area because they want, they want the money. They want to capture that in brooklyn. No, he um, he had, he was in manhattan for awhile and then he, uh, he moved his place to upstate New York and he's constructing this incredible compound where the balls and the building of it are all his art, like his fractal sort of geometric artwork is going to be what the entire outside of the building looks like me. He showed us some of the plans and it's, it's amazing some of his art right there. It's just amazing, amazing stuff. And, and in my opinion, the most accurate in terms of capturing that, that those visionary experiences, those house and hallucinogen based experiences, he's the most accurate in doing that.

Speaker 6:          02:13:17       He did a poRtrait of my dear friend Albert Hoffman. Yes. That the love the style on the cover of a new biography of off.

Speaker 3:          02:13:26       Yes. I love that picture. You know, brian and see if he could pull up that picture of Albert Hoffman that he did. That's a, that's a brilliant

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       picture. Albert hoffman, the guy who first isolated lsd. Um, yeah. The guys like Alex Gray. You see that vision, you see that artwork and he makes you want to try those drugs. Like he, he makes you want to like, man, I want to see that. You know what the father's. Yeah. Yeah. That's an amazing, amazing pictures. Shamanically a representation of him too. Absolutely. And as long as albert doesn't call himself a shaman or. Okay. Right. He's got one of obama, so that's just ridiculous. Alex needs to go read about drones. So alex's Wife wasn't pulling a yoko on you. That's good to know. No, she sat down during the whole thing. she let him talk the entire time. Scream. Why does she, uh, she yoko occasionally.

Speaker 5:          02:14:17       No, I just can't get that thing out.

Speaker 1:          02:14:21       Yeah. Well, I always said negative opinion of yoko or at least not a positive one, but that one just made me howl. That's so great. Well listen, stanley, thank you very much for joining us. This has been a really fun time and I really enjoyed it. It was a real honor to get to sit down and talk to you.

Speaker 5:          02:14:39       Sure. I learned a lot from our discussion. I learned a lot from you.

Speaker 1:          02:14:43       Is there anything you'd like to say to the young folks out there, the people that are in charge of moving this thing to the next era, if you will, you're. You're getting to talk to more than a million people right now. What would you say that.

Speaker 5:          02:14:54       No, we've been talking a lot about about, about psychedelics, and I'd like to remind people that that's only one way to gain wisdom that's not necessary. You can do just about the same thing by immersing yourself in nature, by having a loving relationship with somebody, by meditating, by praying, by immersing yourself in great literature and great art. Psychedelics are important. They were important in human evolution, but there's no one way. There's no one road that's best for everybody.

Speaker 1:          02:15:33       Yoga, meditation, transcendental meditation, sensory deprivation tank use. There's a lot of different methods to sort of reset yourself and get an objective look at the surroundings where you're not caught up in the momentum of your.

Speaker 5:          02:15:48       Exactly. The important thing is to do this with intentionality, to know where you're going in, to do it in a disciplined way and learn something from it,

Speaker 1:          02:15:55       and one of the coolest things about this life is that we get to meet and talk to people that have lived longer and then have had more experiences and it's beautiful that a person like you is willing to share those experiences and come on a show like this and express yourself and give us the wisdom of your years and give us the insight of all your, your, your contemplations on this world. I really appreciate it, man.

Speaker 5:          02:16:21       Very kind of you and very kind of you to say nice things about the voice of rolling thunder and justifying shamans

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       or you can get these books. Are they're available on amazon? Are they available on audible.com? No, no, not yet. Okay. Well we got to work with audible and find some do to. Who would you like to read these? Maybe duncan trussell. He'd be the perfect guy. Do you know dunkin? I know of him, yeah. Would you like to.
